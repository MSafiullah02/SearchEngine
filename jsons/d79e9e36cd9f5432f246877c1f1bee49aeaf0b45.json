We use hierarchical exponential growth curve modeling techniques to examine whether community social and economic characteristics uniquely influence the incidence of Covid-19 cases in the urban built environment. We show that, as of May 3, 2020, confirmed coronavirus infections are concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines in New York City and surrounding areas, the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. Furthermore, we see evidence that, after the onset of the pandemic, timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures is imperative in order to limit the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population. Public health authorities must impose nonpharmaceutical measures early on in the pandemic and consider community-level factors that associate with a greater risk of viral transmission.",

Preliminary analyses indicate that time is most appropriately captured by a polynomial time function due to non-linearity, and thus we present only results from these models. The estimated coefficients in our models represent the estimated effect of concentrated disadvantage on change in the infection incidence rate over time. In the models, time points are nested within counties.

Turning next to Model 2, in the early phase of the outbreak, the estimated average case incidence rate for counties, without the physical distancing measures enacted, and when holding population density and spatial differences constant, is 1.11 (p<0.001). The number of Covid-19 cases is rapidly increasing over time, evidenced by the positive values for the linear (1.66, p<0.001), negative values for the quadratic (0.99, p<0.001), and positive values for the polynomial (1.00, p<0.001) component of the time slope (see, Model 2 in",

Examples of this divergence are illustrated inFigure 1, where we graph the predicted curve for counties with low, medium, and high levels of concentrated disadvantage using the polynomial terms.DiscussionOverall, our results through May 3, 2020, indicate that the number of documented Covid-19 infections varies widely both between counties and over time within counties. For all counties, we observe a substantial increase in the daily number of diagnoses over time and see evidence that earlier enactment of personal protective behaviors, here measured by K-12 school closure dates, likely altered the trajectory of the outbreak. This later finding clearly underscores the importance of timely introduction of mitigation measures to prevent virus diffusion, particularly when used in combination and enacted without delay(20). Thus, in line with prior reports, the nonpharmaceutical interventions may help mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in urban areas with high population density(21).",
