Firstly, we would like the readers to recognize the difference between observable and unobservable events in infectious disease epidemiology. Since both infection event and acquisition of infectiousness are generally not directly observable, the total number of infected individuals could not be counted at a point of time, unless very rigorous contact tracing and microbiological examinations were performed. Directly observable intrinsic parameters, such as the incubation period and serial interval, play key roles in translating observable to unobservable information. Secondly, the concept of dependent happening must be remembered to identify a risk of an infectious disease or to assess vaccine efficacy. Observation of a single infected individual is not independent of observing other individuals. A simple solution for dependent happening is to employ the transmission probability which is conditioned on an exposure to infection.",

Whereas onset events (e.g. onset of fever and appearance of rash) are directly observable in the field (with or without reporting delay), both infection event and acquirement of infectiousness are unobservable without very rigorous contact tracing and experimental (e.g. microbiological) efforts. Besides, almost all models for the population dynamics of infectious diseases have employed a number of assumptions for unobservable events. Observable intrinsic parameters, which characterize the natural history of infection and epidemiologic characteristics of the spread of disease in the absence of public health interventions, must be systematically quantified and employed for infering unobservable events in order to appropriately describe the transmission dynamics.",

Because of the dependence, our population can enjoy herd immunity. Moreover, a necessity arises for theoretical epidemiologists to study infectious disease dynamics using non-linear models. To conduct sound statistical analyses, we should always bear in mind that it is inappropriate to directly apply the concept of relative risk and odds ratio in epidemiology of non-communicable diseases to any assessments of communicable diseases (especially, when the diseases are not endemic). For example, when we evaluate vaccine efficacy, it is far more feasible to employ the ratio of (conditional) probabilities of infection per contact among vaccinated to unvaccinated than directly using the relative risk of infection (which would inform population effectiveness of vaccination).",

The backcalculation method and the estimation of the generation time are briefly reviewed. In Section 4, the concept and definition of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness of vaccination are considered. Dependent happening is comprehensively reviewed in light of causal inference (i.e. identification and quantification of the average causal parameter of effect in a population). A simple methodological solution for the dependent happening follows in Section 5. In particular, the usefulness of household secondary attack rates for estimating vaccine efficacy is reviewed, and the impact of different types of vaccine efficacy on the reproduction number is discussed using a simple dynamic model.",

As we mentioned above, the event of acquiring infectiousness is not directly observable (i.e. in reality, individuals in latent and infectious periods are not distinguishable without microbiological and contact-frequency information), whereas symptom onset of an apparent disease is readily observed and reported. In addition, infection events are not directly observable for the majority of directly transmitted diseases (an exception is seen in sexually transmitted infections where the contact is countable by recall effort). Although several theoretical studies have implicitly assumed that the latent period is exactly the same as the incubation period, acquisition of infectiousness and symptom onset differ clearly by definition and are not directly related [5, 73] . These facts considerably affect the applicability of previous SEIR models that did not take into account these differences. Besides, compartments I and/or R of classical SIR and SEIR models have been fitted to the observed (and mostly onset) data to derive some parameter estimates, although the observed data do not necessarily measure either the theoretically defined I or R. Therefore, it should be noted that both SIR and SEIR models do not clearly highlight the observable events in field epidemiology. This complicates the application of theoretical models to observed data.",

The first is the incubation period, defined as the time from infection with a microorganism to symptom development [16, 73] .

In clinical practice, the incubation period is useful not only for making rough guesses as to the causes and sources of infection of individual cases, but also for developing treatment strategies to extend the incubation period (e.g. antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection [16] ) and for performing early projection of disease prognosis when the incubation period is clearly associated with clinical severity due to dose-response mechanisms (e.g. diseases caused by exotoxin) [74] . Moreover, during an outbreak of a newly emerged directly transmitted disease, the incubation period distribution permits determination of the length of quarantine required for a potentially exposed individual (i.e. by restricting movement of an exposed individual for a duration sufficiently longer than the incubation period) [36] . Further, if the time lag between acquiring infectiousness and symptom onset appears long (i.e., if the incubation period is relatively long compared to the latent period), it implies that isolation measures (e.g. restriction of movement until the infectious individual loses infectiousness) are likely to be ineffective, complicating disease control [42] .",

The distribution is also useful in statistical approaches of epidemic curve reconstruction and short-term predictions of slowly progressing diseases; the backcalculation method uses the incubation period to estimate HIV prevalence and project the future incidence of AIDS [19] . During the last decade, this method has also been extended to prion diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) [31] and vCJD [24] . The backcalculation method is briefly discussed in the next section. This approach has also recently diverged to quantification of the transmission potential of diseases with an acute course of illness [35] and infectiousness relative to disease-age [78] . Moreover, in cases such as the short and long incubation periods of Plasmodium vivax malaria in temperate zones, the incubation period also enhances ecological understanding of adaptation strategies; in temperate zones, clearly separate bimodal peaks with approximate lengths of 2 and 50 weeks are observed [79] , helping malaria transmissions continue over the winter season when transmission is usually greatly reduced due to seasonal entomologic characteristics.",

            "text": "It should be noted that we have limited explicit explanations for the biological validity of assuming lognormal distribution for the incubation period. The fundamental biological reason to assume a lognormal distribution is related to an inoculation study of ectromelia virus (mouse pox) [38] , which suggested exponential growth of pathogens within the host during the initial phase. Another similar study suggested that a fixed threshold of pathogen load likely exists when the host response is observed [71] . In other words, what we have learnt to date can be described as follows: if the growth rate of a microorganism is implicitly assumed to follow normal distribution, and if there is a fixed threshold of pathogen load at which symptoms are revealed due to the host response, exponential growth of microorganisms should result in an incubation period sufficiently approximated by a lognormal distribution [73] . However, the host-defense mechanism, which is almost entirely responsible for symptom onset, was later shown to be far more complex than previously expected. For example, fever is induced by very complex reactions and by several factors including circulating cytokines such as interluekin-2 [72] . Thus, whereas the lognormal distribution may be applied to the incubation periods of many acute infectious diseases, it is necessary to bear in mind that the assumption is supported only by previous experience. When other distributions (e.g. gamma and Weibull distributions) are alternatively chosen to model the incubation period, at least, the statistical issue of inferring time of exposure (during a point source outbreak) can be addressed by estimating threshold parameter for these distributions (i.e. as it can be done with Equation (5)).",

B. Expected daily frequency of secondary transmissions with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The disease-age t = 0 denotes the onset of fever. The illustration was drawn by the author with reference to [76, 78] Figure 2B shows the back-calculated infectiousness of smallpox relative to disease-age [76, 78] . When the frequency is discussed as a function of disease-age of smallpox, day 0 represents the onset of fever. Before onset of fever (i.e. between day -5 and day -1) altogether only 2.7% of all transmissions occurred. Between day 0 and day 2 (i.e. in the prodromal period before the onset of rash) a total of 21.1% of all transmissions occurred. The daily frequency of passing on the infection was highest between day 3 and day 5, yielding a total of 61.8% of all transmissions. These estimates help determine the latest time by which cases should be in isolation. If each primary case infects on average 6 individuals (i.e. R 0 = 6), and if the efficacy of isolation is 100%, the isolation of a primary case before the onset of rash reduces the expected number of victims to 6 \u00d7 (0.027 + 0.211) = 1.428. In other words, Fig. 2B implies that isolation could be extremely effective if performed before onset of rash and that delayed isolation of symptomatic smallpox cases could still be effective if performed within a few days after onset of rash. Consequently, we can expect that optimal isolation could substantially reduce the number of secondary cases, and the outbreak could quickly be brought under control by additional countermeasures (e.g. contact tracing [34] ).",

From the initial growth phase of an epidemic, the intrinsic growth rate, r 0 , i.e. the intrinsic rate of (natural) increase for infected individuals [33] , is estimated, and R 0 can be subsequently estimated using the Equation (16). Thus, the generation-time distribution has been recognized as playing a key role in estimating the transmission potential of a disease [86, 96] . In many instances, R 0 has been inferred from real-time growth data by using the estimate of r 0 and by assuming that the generation-time distribution is known. However, it is very difficult to estimate the generation-time distribution in practice, because infection events are seldom directly observable. Indeed, the estimation methods of the generation time and its sampling scheme have yet to be developed. Previously, the distribution of the generation time (or, at least, the mean generation time) was implicitly (and wrongly) assumed to correspond exactly to that of serial interval. However, this is not the case when the incubation period of the primary case depends on the time from onset to secondary transmission [94] and even the means are different when we deal with diseases with asymptomatic secondary transmissions (which will be discussed below). Figure 3 illustrates an interpretation of the relationship between serial interval S, incubation periods F 1 and F 2 , and generation time G in the absence of asymptomatic cases (i.e. where there is no infected individual who does not exhibit any symptoms throughout the course of infection). We denote the time from onset of primary case to secondary transmission by L (note that L can be negative if pre-symptomatic transmission occurs). The serial interval S is given by",

In other words, it is analytically proven that the mean lengths of one-step and multi-step serial intervals are longer than the mean generation time, as long as asymptomatic transmission exists. In this way, key unobservable information has to be estimated mainly by extracting observable and quantifiable parameters. If one would like to focus on symptom onset as observable event, then the incubation period and serial interval, both definitions of which are concerned with onset event, would play the most important roles among all epidemiologic measurements to translate observables to unobservables. To widen the applicability of mathematical models of infectious diseases, it is essential to construct a theory by observable ingredients and derive an estimator to address the issue of unobservability of infection event and acquirement of infectiousness.",

The vaccination coverage of population A is 20%, whereas that of population B Assuming that the contact patterns are homogeneous and not different between A and B, the risk of infection for a striped individual in population B is smaller than that in population A is 80%. Suppose that the contact pattern is homogeneous in both populations, and assuming that the frequencies of contact are not different between A and B, how different are the risks of infection of a vaccinated individual in the center of these populations? Obviously, the risk in population A is higher than that in B, because individuals surrounding striped (vaccinated) individual in population A are mainly unvaccinated. In other words, even if the vaccination does not offer perfect protection, individuals in population B can enjoy better community benefit compared to that in population A. The community benefit extends to those who would have been infected by the vaccinee, had he developed the disease. Consequently, vaccinees are not only protected to their own benefit, but to the benefit of the community, and moreover, unvaccinated individuals are susceptible not only to their own adversity, but to the adversity of the community. The degree of community protection is referred to as herd immunity [40, 62, 77] . When it comes to the assessment of vaccination, this is also referred to as indirect effect of vaccination. Because of the presence of herd immunity, disease eradication (e.g. of smallpox) was (and can be for other diseases) achieved without vaccinating all susceptible individuals. And, this concept indeed results in a well known control relation to achieve a vaccination coverage, c, which is sufficient to eradicate a disease in a randomly mixing population, i.e.,",

If the distribution is extremely right-skewed (e.g. \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e), this leads R 0 \u2192 \u221e, making it impossible to control the disease by means of mass vaccination only [22, 69] .

In other words, the Equation (72) measures the reduction in infectiousness among vaccinated cases compared to unvaccinated cases. In observation, this conditional measurement can be achieved, in the simplest manner, using the household secondary attack rate. The secondary attack rate, SAR, is the probability that infection occurs among susceptible individuals following a known contact with an infected person (or another infectious source) [49] . In other words, the SAR is conditional on the contact between an infectious source and a susceptible host (it should be noted that the term with rate is a misnomer, because this is actually a proportion). Thus, we write SAR = number of individuals exposed who developed disease total number of susceptible exposed individuals (73) When estimating SAR from epidemiologically observed data, we have to account for the correlation of susceptibles exposed to the same infectious source in order to appropriately quantify SAR. The ratio of two SARs would be extremely useful to estimate the relative infectiousness and susceptibility of two types of populations [48] . Suppose that SAR ij denotes the household secondary attack rate where i and j, respectively, give the previous vaccination histories of the secondary and primary case (i.e. i or j = 1 represents previously vaccinated, whereas i or j = 0 represents unvaccinated individuals).

Rather than investigating an epidemic which ignores background demographic dynamics, here we consider the system with constant per capita birth rate, \u03bc, which is assumed equivalent to the natural mortality rate. Vaccination is assumed to take place at birth with the coverage p. Because of all-or-nothing effect, the fraction p\u03b1 of newborns becomes permanently immune, and the remaining fraction p(1 \u2212 \u03b1) is susceptible. Since we assume that the population sizes of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are constant over time, we ignore the recovered individuals, R v and R u , for simplicity. We also assume that the recovery rate \u03b3 is independent of vaccination, because duration effect is seldom reported [76, 91] and moreover, such observations tend to be limited to the symptomatic period (not infectious period).

Moreover, if \u03b1 = 0, it should be noted that \u03bb S \u03bb I in (90) is equivalent to 1 \u2212 VE T in (76) , which makes (90) idential to (49) . From (90), we observe that the more potent the vaccine (i.e., the smaller is \u03bb S \u03bb I (1 \u2212 \u03b1)), the smaller the vaccination coverage p needs to be to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The use of I c is what we call the Lyapounov function approach, more detailed exercise on this matter (with other types of biological effects of vaccination) can be found elsewhere [92] . This kind of expectation (of different types of vaccine efficacy) arose from field trials of vaccination against HIV/AIDS and malaria [67, 68] , both of which have yet to be developed. As we have seen, it has been very striking that the different biological effects would work as the product to contribute to lower R 0 . Nevertheless, it has to be remembered that this equality of vaccine effects does not hold for non-randomly mixing population. In heterogeneously mixing populations, no single vaccination fraction can define the threshold level of vaccination. Therefore, the challenging issue is that the eradition threshold in such a population will be achieved by vaccinating different subgroups at different levels. In any case, to quantitatively address the issue of estimating different types of vaccine efficacy, the use of household data would be recommended, because household outbreaks contain some information about the possible source of infection and the data reasonably permit assuming homogeneous mixing within the household [12] .",

First, since many unobservable events would always be the source of uncertainty in all mathematical models of the transmission dynamics, observable statistical distributions must be effectively employed to translate observables to unobservables. For this reason, the incubation period and serial interval are deemed critically important epidemiologic measurements, if symptom onset is observable for a disease in question. Therefore, it is essential to make sure that systematically collected data are aggregated and stored for posterity in order to appropriately discuss the dynamics of infectious diseases using observed data. Second, transmission probabilities (or other conditional epidemiologic measurements) per exposure to infection should be effectively employed to address the dependence between individuals, as long as we deal with directly transmitted infectious diseases (i.e. communicable diseases). Although our example of dependent happening was focused on an assessment of vaccine efficacy, the readers are advised to remember (to gain some sense of quantitative modeling) that the need for mathematical modeling in all practical settings arises due to this complicated issue. Rather than numerical computations of complicated models with lots of unsupported assumptions, it is often the case that an analytical approach to conveniently address this issue or useful dataset which is conditioned on infection event may work better to answer to key questions in the field of medical epidemiology and public health.",

Although our framework permits estimating various unobservable epidemiologic variables (e.g. the generation time), statistical and biological validity to assume a specific distribution has yet to be clarified. For this reason, it is necessary to understand the detailed natural history of an infection, especially, as to what is happening within infected host. Symptom onset is not only determined by pathogen dynamics within host but also regulated by complex immune responses [82] . For example, an explicit reason why lognormal distribution fits well with the incubation period of diseases with acute course of illness, and the similar reason for assuming Weibull distribution for the incubation period of AIDS, have yet to be offered.",

Whereas various types of effectiveness of vaccination during an epidemic were defined using final size equations, final size would be greatly confused by heterogeneous contact patterns. For example, even when we consider household transmission, dependence between households must be addressed using an appropriate mathematical approach [9] . Although a mathematical foundation of household transmission has been developed and well-formulated [8] , a quantitative method to effectively utilize the model (e.g. to derive an estimator) has yet to be offered. Given that the final size is always confused by contact heterogeneity, observational approaches to conditionalize key epidemiologic measurements on exposure to infection would play a crucial role in many epidemiological and statistical studies.",
