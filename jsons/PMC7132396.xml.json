Pre-clinical studies indicate that micafungin has fungicidal activity against almost all Candida species, including azole-resistant Candida albicans, and kills the growing tips of Aspergillus species, like other echinocandins. The median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for Aspergillus species (including Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus) were substantially lower than those of other non-echinocandins tested (ie, 0.0078 \u03bcg/mL compared with 0.5\u20132 \u03bcg/mL for amphotericin B), indicating the potential for greater clinical activity than itraconazole and amphotericin B in the same clinical isolates.21 In murine models of IA (both A. fumigatus and A. terreus) micafungin was highly effective in preventing mortality (and superior to liposomal amphotericin B against an A. terreus infection), although cultures tend to remain positive in tissues.22, 23, 24, 25 A dose response from 1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg was observed.24 Micafungin has also been shown to confer synergistic activity to amphotericin B in vitro26 and in murine aspergillosis models.27, 28, 29\n",

            "text": "There is no consensus on the enrollment criteria for clinical failure (salvage) in acute IA. For instance, how many days of primary therapy are necessary before primary therapy can be considered a failure? Also, the variety of at-risk populations and extent of disease at presentation, including extrapulmonary dissemination in some, make a uniform definition suspect. Some patients have very extensive pulmonary infection at diagnosis, which is usually fatal, and so any worsening of disease is synonymous with death. Indeed in all prospective studies of acute IA, including this study, early deaths are a constant feature. Other patients have limited single or multifocal disease that typically responds well to treatment, even if enlarging in volume before shrinking.35 In fact, most rapidly progressive pulmonary lesions do enlarge in the first few days of antifungal therapy,35 making a realistic early determination of response difficult. Likewise, fever and other clinical signs often take several days before starting to resolve. In the present study, patients had to have had at least 3 days of antifungal therapy before enrollment. Most patients, however, were heavily pre-treated. For example, the 148 patients in receipt of a lipid amphotericin B had actually received a mean of 23 days therapy at a mean dose of 6.09 mg/kg immediately prior to enrollment. Because of the heterogeneity of previous therapy, the extent and progressive nature of disease, and different underlying poor prognostic factors, a planned independent review placed patients into different categories to facilitate comparison with other studies.",

Secondary arguments include increasing the antifungal spectrum in empiric therapy to encompass more pathogens including resistant fungi; realizing better pharmacodynamic parameters of one agent over another for certain body sites; preventing the development of resistance; and (possibly) being able to use reduced doses of one or both drugs without loss of activity while minimizing toxicity. During the time in which this study was performed, physicians were only likely to use combination therapy for very ill patients with a high mortality probability. That is probably what happened in this trial, as it was a physician's choice to add or substitute micafungin for refractory cases. Of the 202 amphotericin B-treated patients (36 amphotericin B deoxycholate + 166 lipid-associated amphotericin) treated with the combination of micafungin and an amphotericin preparation, 75 (37.2%) responded.",
