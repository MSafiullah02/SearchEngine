Objective To investigate whether influenza is a significant and unrecognised underlying precipitant of AMI. Design Case-control study. Setting Tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia, during 2008 to 2010. Patients Cases were inpatients with AMI and controls were outpatients without AMI at a hospital in Sydney, Australia. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was laboratory evidence of influenza. Secondary outcome was baseline self-reported acute respiratory tract infection. Results Of 559 participants, 34/275 (12.4%) cases and 19/284 (6.7%) controls had influenza (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.54); half were vaccinated. None were recognised as having influenza during their clinical encounter. After adjustment, influenza infection was no longer a significant predictor of recent AMI. However, influenza vaccination was significantly protective (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.85), with a vaccine effectiveness of 45% (95% CI 15% to 65%). Conclusions Recent influenza infection was an unrecognised comorbidity in almost 10% of hospital patients. Influenza did not predict AMI, but vaccination was significantly protective but underused. The potential population health impact of influenza vaccination, particularly in the age group 50-64 years, who are at risk for AMI but not targeted for vaccination, should be further explored. Our data should inform vaccination policy and cardiologists should be aware of missed opportunities to vaccinate individuals with ischaemic heart disease against influenza.",

            "text": "Influenza is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly, during the annual winter epidemics. 1 Laboratory-confirmed influenza, which represents the 'tip of the iceberg' of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI), causes more morbidity and mortality than any other infectious disease in Australia, with the highest hospitalisation rates for influenza at the extremes of age. 2 In addition to ILI, influenza virus infection can cause a primary viral pneumonia and be complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia, with severe disease and mortality higher in persons with underlying chronic diseases. 3 There is abundant but indirect epidemiological evidence that influenza contributes to all-cause mortality 4 5 and to cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations. 6 Studies show an increase in rates of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and death during the annual influenza season. 6 7 Acute infections in general have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of AMI in observational epidemiological studies. 8 9 One study found the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke was more than four times higher after a respiratory tract infection, with the highest risk in the first 3 days. 8 Despite the compelling observational epidemiological data, the role of infection in ischaemic events is rarely included in the burden of influenza disease estimates and in economic evaluations of influenza vaccination, nor weighed heavily in policy decisions. This is because direct, confirmatory evidence of the role of viruses and respiratory infections in the precipitation of ischaemic events is lacking. This study aimed to examine whether influenza is an unrecognised significant underlying precipitant of acute ischaemic cardiac events.",

A sample size of 88 in each arm (ratio 1:1) was calculated to detect a difference in positive influenza test results of 20% versus 5% with a 95% CI and 80% power. Incidence estimates were based on Australian-specific excess influenza morbidity modelling. 5 We aimed to recruit 300 cases and 300 controls over 3 years to allow for smaller differences in overall and seasonal rates. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Cardiovascular disease is the second largest contributor to disease burden in Australia, accounting for 18% of the total disability-adjusted life years lost. 29 As such, even a small effect of influenza vaccination in preventing AMI may have significant population health gains. The influenza VE in protecting against AMI (45%, 95% CI 15% to 65%) in our study and other similar studies indicates a substantial potential population health impact on ischaemic heart disease by vaccinating younger adults. Approximately 3.4 million Australians are affected by cardiovascular disease. 30 Although two-thirds of the burden is in older adults, 19% of 45-54-year-olds and 5% of those aged under 45 years are affected. 30 Influenza vaccination of people with an index AMI could also have a significant impact, with high rates of subsequent acute coronary events in patients with AMI. Death or re-infarction occurred in six of 100 patients within 1 month, and 27 within 1 year in unvaccinated AMI patients on standard treatment. 20 Clinicians should consider vaccination of AMI patients before hospital discharge.",

            "text": "Ours is an observational study and is subject to the limitations of its non-randomised and its unmatched study design. The sample size, although adequate to detect a difference in influenza positive results, was small considering the number of vaccinated participants, but the study was intensive and difficult to conduct, and achieving final sample size required 3 years of recruitment. Australia has a funded influenza vaccination programme for people aged 65 years and older, with uptake rates >85%. Our controls were older than AMI cases, and therefore more likely to be vaccinated and more likely to be living alone, which could affect exposure status. Given the strong relationship between age and vaccination uptake, and the older age of controls, the study would have benefited from being individually age-matched. However, we adjusted for age in our model, and influenza vaccination remained significant. Further, controls were recruited from outpatient clinics and representative of community-acquired influenza. While there is the possibility that controls may have not attended due to severe influenza infection, the majority of participants found to have laboratory evidence of influenza did not report acute respiratory symptoms. The modelling adjusted for the factors which were unequally distributed between cases and controls. It is reassuring that known risk factors of age, current smoking and high cholesterol were found to be significant predictors of AMI in our model, the last being the two largest predictors of AMI in the INTERHEART study. 31 Our study did not find a self-reported history of diabetes or hypertension or alcohol consumption to be predictors of AMI. 31 While we did not control for all possible confounders, residual confounding is a concern for all case-control studies if confounding variables are not measured or adjusted for. For example, influenza vaccination was excluded from the INTERHEART study. 31 We believe we have included all major confounders in our model. The low national influenza season in 2010 limited our statistical power and may explain why influenza infection did not significantly predict AMI. The number of vaccinated subjects was far greater than the number with documented influenza infection, therefore affording greater statistical power for examining the association of AMI with vaccination. Our study is strengthened by collection over a number of influenza seasons and the use of laboratoryconfirmed influenza as a primary variable of interest, rather than self-reported ARTI, which is subject to biases. With a strict definition of AMI, it is unlikely that misclassification of AMI has occurred, which would unduly bias VE calculations. An overestimation of vaccination status would bias VE estimates; however, we have classified vaccination status based on GP verified reports, in which more than 75% of participants were able to be verified.",

The current recommendations are for selective vaccination of people with known risk factors often at personal expense. However, this does not achieve adequate vaccination rates. 27 Other studies which have looked at influenza and AMI in people aged <65 years have shown mixed results, but even a small reduction in AMI by prevention of influenza may have population health benefit. 32 33 The role of an expanded vaccination programme for adults over 50 years of age, which would capture a significant proportion of people at risk of AMI, should be explored by further research.
