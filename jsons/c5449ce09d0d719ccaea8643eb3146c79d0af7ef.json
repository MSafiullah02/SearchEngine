            "text": "The world aging population is continuously rising and Italy is the second country following Japan with the largest concentration of persons living over the age of 65 years (1) . At the moment, 22.4% of the Italian population is over the age of 65 years. Even though reaching advanced age in any country should be considered a significant and outstanding accomplishment, such triumph does not seem to come without sacrifice. Advanced aging is also accompanied by the increase in the risk of numerous comorbidities, such as arterial hypertension, heart disease, dementia, osteoporosis, cancer, Type 2 Diabetes, as well as other disease states that require continuous medical treatment. Most of these treatments require individual geriatric care modeling in order to maintain a \"healthy\" equilibrium necessary to avoid the irreversible spiral of the Frailty Syndrome. Frailty has been defined as a \"syndrome characterized by a clinical state in which there is an increase in an individual's vulnerability for developing an increased dependency and/or mortality when exposed to a stressor\" (2) . Frailty should be considered a constantly evolving syndrome and only reversible if appropriate intervention is quickly recognized and applied. Indeed, there is substantial literature underlining the importance of geriatric medicine toward frailty prevention and clinical criteria to rapidly identify those with frailty or pre-frailty (3) (4) (5) . If any negative health conditions break the equilibrium, the irreversible downward spiraling of frailty will begin. Over the last few months, there has been a worldwide rise infection of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of March 27th, the country of Italy has over 79,900 persons infected with COVID-19 and 7590 deaths associated with COVID-19. Therefore, due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Italy, there seems to be a deadly trend toward mortality with COVID-19 in older patients with specific comorbidities, thus identifying a new \"COVID Spiraling Frailty Syndrome\". This brief commentary will provide recent findings related to age-related comorbidities commonly found in advanced age and their percentages in older Italians that have recently died with a COVID-19. We will also consider potential aspects of different drugs for such comorbidities and COVID-19. This commentary specifically focuses on the Italian population of older patients in the last month of disease spread.",

Considering that infection from COVID-19 is strongly associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it would seem obvious that patients with depressed immune response, such as in those patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or Chronic Renal Insufficiency would be at a significantly higher risk for SARS. However, available data from the ISS show that the most common comorbidities observed in all Italians dying with COVID-19 are arterial hypertension (74.7%) and Type 2 Diabetes (30.5%) (6). Interestingly, the same comorbidities have also been found to hold high percentages in Chinese retrospective data from COVID. For example, Yang X et al. (8) found that in 52 non-survivors with COVID-19, 22% had Type 2 Diabetes, while another study found that hypertension was the most common comorbidity reaching 30% in a sample of 191 patients (9) . In recently published Chinese report, regarding an in-hospital sample of older persons (n=4,348) with a mean age of 74 years, found that hypertension was the most common comorbidity (63.1% prevalence) and increased to 72.5% in over 80 year olds from Wuhan (10). Indeed, both hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes were associated with a higher odds ratio of in-hospital death with COVID-19 (9). Unfortunately, data regarding regular drug regimens for these comorbidities prior to hospitalization in those dying with COVID in these studies was not assessed. In 2017, a Chinese study underlined that in over a million patients, the most commonly used anti-hypertensive agent was calcium-channel blockers (11) .",

However, ARBs have been shown to improve on endothelial dysfunction by increasing levels of Angiotensin- (1-7) , a vasodilator especially present in increased ACE-2 expression (16) . At the moment, future studies are needed to identify the pathways related to a potential role of ACE-2 expression on facilitating COVID-19 infection in those undergoing drug treatments with ACE inhibitors and ARBs for hypertension. At the moment, older patients with diabetes seem to have a significantly higher risk of mortality with COVID-19. Over the years, there has been substantial data underling an important role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on glycemic control (17) . In particular, ACE-2 seems to play a role on blocking Angiotensin II-mediated hyperglycemia. ARBs and ACE inhibitors improve glycemia by blocking RAS over activity. It has been recently highlighted that ACE-2 is increased in patients with diabetes undergoing treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs (13) . The underlying question remains if the increased expression of ACE-2 can protect or increase the risk of the development and mortality associated with COVID-19! Testing which specific anti-diabetic oral agents are correlated with COVID-19 and mortality in older patients will add novel insight.",
