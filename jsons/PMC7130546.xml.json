Many researchers have identified that cleanliness is the most important attribute influencing the decision of selecting hotel accommodation (Weaver and Oh, 1993, Callan and Bowman, 2000, Lockyer, 2005). Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that good indoor air quality (IAQ) should also be an important attribute for hotels. This is especially true as hotel guests typically comprise a high proportion of international travelers and a good mix of dignitaries and officials who demand high IAQ. Equally, inadequate IAQ invariably brings complaints (Bohdanowicz and Martinac, 2002).",

            "text": "More recently, research findings have indicated that air pollution in East and South Asia has been deteriorating due to accelerated economic expansion and population growth. Brauer et al. (2012) found that there is a high concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in South and East Asia (annual averages >50 \u03bcg/m3). PM2.5 is generally considered to be the most robust indicator of adverse (mortality) impacts in epidemiologic cohort studies of long-term exposure. They are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. An extensive epidemiological literature relates PM2.5 to adverse health impacts (Pope et al., 2002, Pope and Dockery, 2006, Dockery, 2009). Latterly, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) officially classified air pollution mixing with suspended particles in the air as a level 1 carcinogen. It stated that there is \u201csufficient evidence\u201d that exposure to outdoor air pollution causes lung cancer and also linked it with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Such exposure has increased significantly in China (IARC, 2013). Since the ventilation systems need to regularly draw outdoor air into buildings, hotel guests who staying indoor still have to breathe the polluted outdoor air if there is no air filtration equipment in hotels. Therefore, travelers who plan to come to China are increasingly concerned about air quality. According to the China National Tourism Administration, from January to June in 2013, the total number of foreign arrivals dropped by 5% to just under 13 million compared with the same period in 2012 (Watt, 2013).",

            "text": "There are also other types of indoor air pollution in China apart from such incoming outdoor air pollutants. One of them is smoking. In China, smoking in hotel guest rooms still prevails except on non-smoking floors. Cigarettes generate high amounts of toxic air pollutants which also include PM2.5. These pollutants may be carcinogenic, or may cause other non cancer-related health problems (Facchini et al., 1992, Rimm et al., 1993, Hu et al., 2001, Komiya et al., 2006). The other possible source for indoor air pollution in hotels is renovation. As stated by Meckler (1996), renovation work could be the greatest source of IAQ problems for buildings. Many interior materials contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which cause discomfort to the respiratory system and irritation to eyes (Burton, 1997). The increasing occurrence of poor levels of IAQ may be linked to the shortening length of the renovation cycle in hotels in recent years, and the opening of more new hotels which is set to grow further in coming years. One study has indicated that most new hotels in the Pearl River Delta of China were more polluted than older hotels and residential buildings (Chan et al., 2009a, Chan et al., 2009b). In addition, poorly designed, maintained or operated air-conditioning and ventilation systems can also cause indoor air problems (Kuo et al., 2008). Many studies have shown that ventilation systems may occasionally act as a source of pollutants, such as microbes, chemical compounds or odors (Lysne et al., 1999, Sundell et al., 1993, Bj\u00f6rkroth et al., 1997).",

For measuring the TVOC, A ppbRAE 3000 monitor was used for continuous recording of TVOC concentrations for eight hours. The ppbRAE 3000 can detect a very wide range of VOCs, including benzene, isobutene, methylene chloride, hexane, toluene, trichloroethane, styrene, heptane, perchloroethylene, and etc. The lamp and sensor of ppbRAE 3000 were manually cleaned before the testing in order to avoid the drift of photoionization detector. Prior to sampling, the ppbRAE 3000 monitor was calibrated by a calibration gas (isobutylene) with a known concentration of 10 ppm supplied by the manufacturer. For individual VOC sampling, a canister sampling method was used. A batch of pre-cleaned canisters for sample collection was evacuated before sampling. Time-integrated VOC air samples were obtained by using mass flow controllers at a flow rate of 0.0042 l/min for 8 h. After sampling, the canisters were immediately transported to an authorized air laboratory supplier for GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass selective) analysis. A NUTECH Cryogenic Concentrator was used for sample pre-concentration and followed by an Agilent 6890/5873 GC/MSD system to conduct the analysis.

Table 4\nshows that the average concentrations of TVOC of Room 1, Room 2 and Room 3 are 185, 166 and 118 ppb before running the air cleaners. Each of these values exceeds the threshold value.

The value in Room 1 and Room 2 reduced from 185 ppb to 156 ppb and 166 to 150 ppb, respectively. However, the average concentration of TVOC in Room 3 increased from 118 to 245 ppb. This implies that either there is an indoor source of TVOC in these guest rooms, or the sorbent filters of the air cleaner in Room 3 had reached saturation and released trapped pollutants back into the indoor air, or both (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2009). The background level of TVOC in the studied rooms ranging from 116 to 185 ppb, which are far lower than those measurements (1035 \u03bcg/m3\n \u2248 260 ppb) in earlier studies in eight hotels in factory region (Chan et al., 2009a, Chan et al., 2009b). When the result was compared with the TVOC findings (62 \u03bc g/m3 and 120 \u03bc g/m3\n \u2248 16 ppb and 30 ppb) in home and hostels, the study observed that the result is higher than the measured levels of TVOC in homes and hostels (Kumar et al., 2014). This is probably due to the use of more decorative materials with adhesive agents. Because there are indoor TVOC pollutant sources and the air conditioning was turned off for movable air cleaners, another method of calculating the removal efficiency of air cleaners was employed in this study, as shown in Table 5\n. The TVOC accumulation rate was measured before and after running the air cleaners.",

Before running the air cleaners, the highest concentrations of bacteria and fungi were both found in Room 1, at 930 cfu/m3 and 670 cfu/m3 respectively. After running the air cleaner for 24 h, the concentrations dropped to 460 cfu/m3 and 340 cfu/m3, which were below the recommended values. In addition, the values for outdoor bacteria and fungi concentrations were generally higher than the indoor concentrations, which indicated that these microbial pollutions were more serious in the outdoor environment than in the indoor space. The bacteria and fungi in rooms are more likely to be transferred from the outdoor environment, rather than originating indoors. It should be noticed that the bacteria concentration in Room 3 increased after the cleaner had been running. Considering that the TVOC level in Room 3 also increased after running the P brand air cleaner, it is likely that the P brand movable air cleaner in Room 3 had reached its saturation and was releasing trapped pollutants back into the indoor air.

This finding may be due to the fact that current hospitality training programs focus on visible cleanliness standards, and do not contain detailed knowledge on IAQ. It is thus recommended that IAQ components should be incorporated in future revisions to training programs. In addition, hospitality education administrators should monitor the teaching coverage of this topic. To support this suggested future development, trade councils and hotel schools should allocate resources to provide short courses to update and enrich existing staff knowledge into this area.",

Thus, hoteliers should also be educated in this area or be provided with more information about these aspects.

Matt et al. (2013) further confirms the former assertion by measuring tobacco smoke pollutants in 40 hotel rooms in California. Their research finds that non-smoking guests staying in non-smoking rooms of hotels without complete smoking bans showed significantly higher levels of nicotine on their fingers than after staying in hotels with complete smoking bans. Future research should take note of this influence.",

Future sampling and analysis in these three areas may provide hoteliers a deeper understanding and an objective yardstick for improving IAQ in accommodation area. In addition, the significant impact of smoking on IAQ is also an important topic, especially for Chinese hotels. Firstly, the number of smokers is very large. Secondly, a hotel guest room is a small and enclosed environment. It is generally a single room with doors and windows that are usually kept closed. Therefore smoking could cause more damage in hotel rooms than in other indoor environment. Future research may consider carry out experiment in this area.",
