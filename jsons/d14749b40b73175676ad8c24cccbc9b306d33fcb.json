Confinement affects most aspects of human physiology considerably. The psychological stress of remaining in a confined space causes endocrinological changes that, in turn, affect immune status 6 and have other negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. 7 Even a relatively short, 10-day confinement can cause the markers of lymphocyte expression to be reduced and alterations in natural killer cell profiles can occur. 8 On the opposite side, after a period of longer confinement the number of circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes rapidly increases. 9 In certain environments people in isolation will encounter an exceptional situation where they will be exposed to both, a hypoxic and confined environment (e.g., living at high altitude such as Denver, Mexico City, Kathmandu, and La Paz).",

To decrease those health problems, exercise professionals should encourage organizations, local authorities, and governments to promote PA during this period of mass quarantine, whether it is performed in the safety of people's homes or, if it is safe and allowed by authorities, in nature. 11 The simplest mean for reducing the psychological stress of confinement is regular PA. 12 Data from a recent meta-analysis conclude that dose responses for both the intensity and duration of exercise shows large benefits to mental health from even short engagements in green spaces. 13 The existing evidence shows that natural environments have the most effective restorative effects for psychological fatigue 14 and that green spaces increase feelings of contentment, reduce depression, reduce feelings of anger, and diminish anxiety. 15 However, when outdoor exercise is unavailable, exercising indoors is the next best option providing improvement of general health 16 as well as mental health. 17, 18 The logistical issues governing all aspects of daily life that hundreds of millions of people are now confronted with during the current COVID-19 outbreak are unprecedented. It is critical that all persons take collective responsibility of their actions as never before. During this rapid and evolving pandemic crisis, everyone is searching for the best-practice medical advice on how to maintain a (somewhat) normal daily life, whilst still attempting to curtail this most serious viral outbreak and follow social distancing and shelter-in-place or self-isolation guidelines. 19 With this in mind, sport science researchers, medical professionals, and environmental physiologists from the \u2022 Do incorporate stretching and breathing deeply each day.

            "text": "Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana have developed a set of PA recommendations for the people of the Republic of Slovenia specifically, that we believe could be of some help for global community and other exercise professionals. These recommendations consider accumulated knowledge communicated in PA position stands from World Health Organization,20 AmericanCollege of Sports Medicine,21 and compelling research from various space agencies (e.g., NationalAeronautics and Space Administration 22 or European Space Agency 23 ), on the physiological effects of confinement on the human body. The guidance below is intended for people without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, who find themselves in a self-quarantine situation for days (or weeks) at a time. The guidelines do not replace medical guidance from your healthcare provider. Considering this, we suggest emphasizing the following points for promoting PA during times of social distancing and isolation:\u2022Do exercise outdoors wherever possible and perform your choice of low-to-moderate intensity PA daily, either alone or with your family unit. It is critical to stress here that all persons must follow the suggested guidelines of their authorities. Whenever possible use the largest possible distance from others while outside (even more than the typically suggested 1.5 m). PA (exercise as well as active commuting) from home door to home door without directly contacting others is highly recommended.\u2022 Do not socialize and play group sports with people outside your household. Parents, avoid having your children interacting directly with other children. In particular, explain in ageappropriate language the risks of virus transmission that can occur with socializing in group or team sport situations.\u2022 Do not allow children to climb on park equipment, slides, and other features (especially metal and plastic), including outdoor fitness equipment, since they provide a surface for virus transmission.",
