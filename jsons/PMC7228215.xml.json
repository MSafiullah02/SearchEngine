The NCP is caused by a new coronavirus (SARS\u2010COV\u20102) of the Sarbe virus subgenus, a member of orthocoronavirus subfamily.\n1\n SARS\u2010COV\u20102 is a member of the coronavirus family along with SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV. With the deepening of research, more and more evidence show that its transmission channels are diversified, and its transmission speed and infectivity are stronger than SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China has taken active prevention and control measures and achieved good results, but, recently, the epidemic situation abroad has begun to develop into an uncontrollable situation. As of 28 February 2020, the epidemic of NCP has affected six continents, and the epidemic situation in South Korea, Italy, Japan, and other countries is extremely serious. On 29 February, the \u201cChina\u2010WHO NCP (COVID\u201019) Joint Inspection Report\u201d stated that the NCP is almost susceptible to everyone on the same day. On 11 March, the WHO declared the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak as pandemic. Currently, published studies and case reports indicate that patients with NCP have very different clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and imaging tests, making clinical diagnosis and treatment limited. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the understanding of the clinical characteristics of patients with NCP to further guide clinical and scientific research through evidence\u2010based medicine.",

A few patients had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other abdominal discomfort symptoms, whereas very few patients showed hemoptysis symptoms. Most patients with NCP required hospitalization, of which 29.3% required intensive care. The main complications are respiratory failure, ARDS (28.8%) and multiple organ failure (8.5%), and heart failure, shock, renal injury, sepsis, striated muscle lysis, and diffuse intravascular coagulation are rare. According to the severity, the patients with NCP can be divided into mild, normal type (80%), medium type, and severe type (13.8%). The clinical manifestations of patients with different severity vary greatly. According to statistics, the fatality rate in China is about 3.8%,\n37\n lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and MERS (35%). The main causes of death are massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Generally, viral pneumonia mainly involves pulmonary interstitium, producing pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. The autopsy report of the first NCP patient in China found that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) mainly caused the inflammatory response characterized by deep airway and alveolar damage, accompanied by a large amount of viscous secretions in the airway. The pulmonary transparent membrane became less obvious, and the degree of fibrosis was not as severe as SARS.\n38\n However, the degree of effect of COVID\u201019 on pulmonary fibrosis still needs to be paid close attention, which is also an important factor influencing pulmonary function in the prognosis of patients with NCP.",

A few patients had elevated creatine kinase procalcitonin bilirubin, whereas some had decreased albumin and elevated ALT, AST. The pathological results of patients with SARS\u2010COV\u20102 suggested that the excessive activation of T lymphocytes, which is characterized by increased Th17 cells and high toxicity of CD8+ T cells, has caused severe immune damage to a certain extent.\n4\n This may be the main reason for the loss of lymphocytes in patients. Sequence comparison analysis showed that the S spike protein of SARS\u2010COV\u20102 contains a SARS\u2010CoV\u2010like receptor binding domain, which indicates that ACE2 may be the main receptor of SARS\u2010COV\u20102.\n3\n ACE2 was highly expressed in gastric and testicular epithelial cells, and also enriched in colon, heart, kidney, and so on. Over\u2010expressed ACE2 may be related to the elevated liver enzyme.\n39\n The similarity of SARS\u2010COV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV gene sequences suggests that the mechanism of action may also be similar. SARS\u2010COV\u20102 enters host cells through dense S protein,\n40\n, \n41\n acts on bronchial epithelial cells through ACE2 receptor, and then infects other cells, causing a series of immune responses or inflammatory cytokine storm in severe cases.

The \u201cthree early\u201d principle (early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment) followed by disease prevention and treatment is particularly important in the prevention and treatment of SARS\u2010COV\u20102. In addition, the clinical manifestations of patients with neocoronary pneumonia are diverse and the atypical symptoms also account for part of the proportion. Therefore, we systematically analyzed the clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results of patients with COVID\u201019, so as to reflect the disease characteristics more comprehensively, increase the discrimination of the disease, and strive for early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment.",

Certainly, prevention of imported cases is also extremely important.\n45\n Particularly, in some densely populated markets, stations, large ports, and other places, protective deployment measures should be strengthened to ensure that protective equipment, drugs, medical supplies, and so on are sufficient.\n46\n National public health capabilities and infrastructure remain at the core of global health security, as they are the first line of defense for infectious disease emergencies.\n47\n The International Health Organization, all countries, and all humanity need to pay great attention to SARS\u2010COV\u20102.",
