The most common enteric avian viruses are astroviruses (AstV), coronaviruses (CoV), reoviruses (RV), and rotaviruses (RoV) (Pantain-Jackwood et al., 2008; Jindal et al., 2010b). In most recent studies, these viruses have been detected in commercial broiler flocks in the United States, causing significant economic loss due to mortality and low feed conversion rates (FCR) as a result of enteritis or diarrhea. Also, this may lead to the disease condition called runting-stunting syndrome or malabsorption syndrome (RSS or MAS) in broiler flocks (Pantain-Jackwood et al., 2008; Saif, 2008).",

Enteric virus isolation and detection by conventional methods has many limitations due to the fact that some of these viruses are very difficult to propagate and isolate using SPF eggs, as in the case of rotaviruses (Jones, 2008). Also, antigen-capture ELISA has shown difficulty in detecting some of these viruses, indicating that this technique is not reliable (Minamoto et al., 1988; Saif, 2008).",

The same reaction mixture was used as standard for the other viruses tested in this study.

It was recently shown that this gene has enterotoxin activity leading to diarrhea in suckling mice (Mori et al., 2002). Thermal cycle condition were as follows: 1 cycle of 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and the final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min (Pantain-Jackwood et al., 2008). First positive bands were extracted and subjected to sequencing and revealed >96% identity to other ARoVs (KU253626). These positive samples were used as positive control for subsequent reactions.",

A similar prevalence rate was found by a previous studies in the United States and Korea to detect enteric viruses (Pantain-Jackwood et al., 2008; Koo et al., 2013), but there was a variation of detection for each virus alone among these studies. In our study, ACoV was the most prevalent among these viruses (ACoV, AstV, ARoV, ARV), which may be due to the intensive use of the IBV vaccine at early age in our broiler farms, potentially increasing the possibility of field virus load and rolling among flocks; hence mutation and diversity may occur due to vaccine virus. Based on S1 gene molecular characteristics study, some of field isolates rolling among broiler flocks were found highly similar to vaccine strains (H120, Mass 41), which are the same used to immunize these flocks against IBV (Gelb et al., 2005). Also, an evolutionary trend from respiratory to enteric and vice versa has already reported (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Cook et al., 1999), with the virus detected at higher proportions in the diarrhea group than in the healthy group. Villarreal et al. (2007) found ACoV to be the main causative agent for enteritis in broiler flocks; other caustive agents were not detected in the surveyed flocks.",

Group D rotaviruses are the most frequently identified group in poultry flocks (Saif, 2008). In our study, we detected ARoV by targeting NSP4, which is a non-group-specific gene; the virus was detected in about 12% of the diarrhoeic group and significantly higher than non-diarrhoeic group (6%). The pathogenicity of the virus is sometimes not evident, and subclinical infection frequently occurs (Minamoto et al., 1988). Furthermore, the age of the flock may play a role in the severity of infection, with older age flocks being more susceptible than younger ones (Yason and Schat, 1987). On the other hand, ARoV is more pathogenic in turkeys than in chickens (Saif et al., 2008; Jindal et al., 2010a), and is known to cause the poult enteritis and mortality syndrome in turkeys. Since Jordan does not have any turkey farms, this may have led to decreased viral load in the field, or may have even resulted in the pathogenicity becoming mild in the environment. A previous study to detect these enteric viruses was carried out by Roussan et al. (2012), but we could not take their results into consideration due to weakness of the work and important missing data.",
