Muller and co-workers [16] were the first to prove that it binds to cell surface proteins and suggested that its biological activity is the consequence of its inhibition of cell surface leucine aminopeptidase [17]. Aminopeptidase W [18] and aminopeptidase N (APN) [5] were proposed to be the key aminopeptidases responsible for the biological effects of aminopeptidase inhibitors. Additional support for the idea that APN is involved in regulating cell proliferation is provided by the facts that increased expression of APN is associated with increased proliferation of activated T cells [19] and CD34+ cord blood cells [20], and that APN antisense RNA inhibits cell proliferation of H9 and U937 cells [21]. On the other hand the sensitivity of different cell lines to bestatin does not correlate with the expression of APN [11]. Furthermore, amastatin, an inhibitor of APN [8], and antibodies against APN that inhibit its enzyme activity did not inhibit cell proliferation, and anti-APN antibodies also did not hinder the inhibitory effect of another inhibitor of APN, actinonin, on cell proliferation [22]. These findings, supported by the fact that bestatin methyl ester, a hydrophobic derivative of bestatin, induces apoptosis at lower concentrations than bestatin [11], suggest that aminopeptidase inhibitors inhibit cell proliferation by intracellular activity.",

We measured the antiproliferative effect of these inhibitors on two leukemia cell lines in the presence of drug efflux modifiers. K562 and U937 cells have been shown to express multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) [25], [26], [27], both of which belong to the group of transporter proteins known to decrease intracellular drug accumulation and to cause drug resistance of cancer cells (reviewed in Ref. [28]). As drug efflux modifiers we used buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, that impairs the action of MRP, a glutathione-dependent drug efflux pump [29], [30], MK-571 (3-([{3-(2-[7-chloro-2-quinolinyl]-ethenyl)-phenyl}-{(3-dimethyl-amino-3-oxopropyl)-thio}-methyl]thio)propanoic acid), a leukotriene receptor antagonist that also inhibits MRP-dependent transport [31] and verapamil, a calcium channel blocker that impairs the activity of Pgp [32]. If bestatin and actinonin inhibit cell proliferation by intracellular activity, inhibitors of their efflux would be expected to increase their effect on K562 and U937 cells.",

Possible explanations could be passive transport through the lipid bilayer, receptor-mediated endocytosis, or transport mediated by special proteins expressed on cell surface. Passive transport is implied by the results of Sekine et al. [11], which showed that a hydrophobic derivative of bestatin induces apoptosis at lower concentrations than bestatin, and also by the long incubation time necessary to detect the antiproliferative effect of aminopeptidase inhibitors. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is indicated by the IC50p values (Table 1), which are lower for both aminopeptidase inhibitors on U937 cells which exhibit higher expression of APN, suggesting that endocytosis of bestatin and actinonin could be mediated by APN. It has already been shown that APN serves as a receptor for coronavirus TGEV [38]. Finally, bestatin and actinonin could enter the cells also by special transporter proteins, as has been shown for HeLa cells transfected with PepT1 [39].",
