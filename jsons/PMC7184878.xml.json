This modification was performed according to the similar orientation with\nthe template inhibitor using the small molecules tool implemented in Accelrys Discovery\nStudio 2.5 (Accelrys Inc.). The protonation states of all ionizable amino acids were\nassigned at pH 7.4 using the H++ web server,22 except for the catalytic\nresidue H41 that was set as the neutral form with a protonated delta position (HID type of\nAMBER format) in accordance with the common reaction mechanism of cysteine\nprotease.23 The chemical structures of lopinavir (ZINC3951740) and\nritonavir (ZINC3944422) were downloaded from the ZINC15 database.24 The\nelectrostatic potential (ESP) charges of both ligands were calculated with the HF/6-31G*\nlevel of theory using the Gaussian09 program.25 The antechamber and\nparmchk modules of AMBER16 were used to generate the restrained ESP charges and missing\nparameters of the two drugs, respectively. The bonded and nonbonded parameters for the\nprotein and ligand were treated with the AMBER ff14SB force field26 and\ngeneralized AMBER force field version 2 (GAFF2),27 accordingly. Missing\nhydrogen atoms were added using the LEaP module implemented in AMBER16. Afterward, the\nTIP3P water model28 was used to solvate each system with a minimum\ndistance of 10 \u00c5 between the protein surface and the solvation box edge, and the box\ndimensions were set to approximately 114 \u00c5 \u00d7 97 \u00c5 \u00d7 92 \u00c5. The\nsodium ions were then randomly added to neutralize the simulated systems. The added\nhydrogen atoms and water molecules were minimized using 500 steps of steepest descent (SD)\nfollowed by 1500 steps of conjugated gradient (CG) methods before running the MD\nsimulations, while the rest of the molecules were held fixed. Then, the protein and ligand\nwere minimized by SD (500 iterations) and CG (1500 iterations) methods with constrained\nsolvent molecules. Finally, the whole complex was fully minimized using the same\nprocedure.",

The SHAKE algorithm34\nwas used to constrain all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. A 2 fs simulation time\nstep was used throughout the MD simulation. The temperature and pressure were controlled\nby the Langevin thermostat35 with a collision frequency of 2\nps\u20131 and the Berendsen barostat36 with a\npressure-relaxation time of 1 ps. For the heating step, each simulated system was\ngradually heated from 10 to 310 K for 200 ps with a harmonic positional restraint of 30.0\nkcal mol\u20131 \u00c5\u20132 applied to the C\u03b1 atoms of\nthe protein. To equilibrate the system, each complex was then subjected to four steps of\nrestrained MD simulations at 310 K with harmonic restraints of 30, 20, 10, and 5 kcal\nmol\u20131 \u00c5\u20132 for 1300 ps in total and another 200\nps without any restraint. Subsequently, the entire system was simulated under the\nNPT ensemble (310 K and 1 atm) until reaching 100 ns. The MD\ntrajectories were saved every 10 ps. The calculations in terms of the root-mean-square\ndisplacement (RMSD), the number of protein\u2013drug hydrogen bonds (# H-bonds), and the\nnumber of atomic contacts (# atom contacts) with the drug molecule were used to verify the\nstability of all investigated models as well as the structural features of each complex.\nThe H-bond interactions were calculated using two criteria: (i) distance between the\nhydrogen donor (HD) and acceptor (HA) of \u22643.5 \u00c5 and (ii)\nHD\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7HA angle of \u2265150\u00b0. The # atom contacts were\ncounted from the number of 3CLpro atoms within 3.5 \u00c5 of each drug. To\nevaluate the binding affinity and the key binding residues involved in ligand binding of\nthe protein\u2013ligand complexes, the total binding free energy\n(\u0394Gbind) and per-residue decomposition free energy\n(\u0394Gbindresidue) calculations based on molecular mechanics/Poisson\u2013Boltzmann\n(generalized Born) surface area [MM/PB(GB)SA] methods were performed on 100 MD snapshots\nextracted from the last 20 ns of the MD production phase. It should be noted that the\nprotein\u2013ligand interactions and the binding free energies were carried out using\nthe CPPTRAJ37 and MMPBSA.py38 modules of AMBER16,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the intermolecular interactions between the drug and its\nbinding residues at the atomic level were described by pair interaction energy\ndecomposition analysis (PIEDA) based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method at the\nsecond-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation energy and the 6-31G* level of theory\n(FMO-MP2/6-31G*) using GAMESS.39 The solvation effect was also treated\nwith a polarizable continuum model (PCM). The paired interaction energy\n(\u0394EijPIEDA) involved in ligand binding was evaluated by a summation of\nthe electrostatic (EijES), dispersion (EijDI), charge transfer\n(EijCT+mix), and charge exchange (EijEX) energies, as well as PCM\nsolvation (GsolPCM), using the following equation:40\u221242",

            "text": "In this work, the binding pattern and susceptibility of the two HIV-1 protease inhibitors\nlopinavir and ritonavir in complex with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were fully revealed by\nall-atom MD simulations, binding free energy estimation, and PIEDA based on the MM/PB(GB)SA\nand FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* calculations, respectively. According to\n\u0394Gbind prediction, the susceptibility against SARS-CoV-2\n3CLpro of ritonavir was somewhat higher than that of lopinavir, supported by\nenergy stabilization from individual residues that resulted from both methods: (i) M49,\nM165, P168, and Q189 from MM/GBSA for lopinavir and L27, H41, M49, F140, N142, G143, H164,\nM165, and E166 from MM/GBSA for ritonavir and (ii) H41, A46, M49, E166, L167, L187, Q189,\nA191, and A193 from FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* for lopinavir and N142, G143, S144, C145, M165, E166,\nD187, and Q189 from FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* for ritonavir. In addition, the oxyanion hole\nresidues N142 and G143 were found to interact with ritonavir via hydrogen bonds. From the\nFMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* data, the electrostatics, dispersion, and charge transfer were considered\nas the important interactions for drug binding. The obtained results demonstrated how\nrepurposed anti-HIV drugs could be used to combat COVID-19 and how fundamental knowledge at\nthe atomic level could also be helpful for the further design or development of more\nspecific inhibitors in treating human coronaviruses.",
