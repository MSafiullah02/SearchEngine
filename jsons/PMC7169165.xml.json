Data regarding the use of systemic corticosteroids are limited in the Asia\u2010Pacific region. A Turkish study comparing efficacy between oral steroid and intravenous methylprednisolone66 found that the improvement of blood gas parameters, symptom scores, length of stay and readmission due to AECOPD were comparable with these two treatments. However, the group receiving intravenous methylprednisolone had more events of recurrent AECOPD requiring attendance to emergency department, hyperglycaemia and worsened blood pressure control.67 The scarcity of data is also indirectly reflected by the inconsistent corticosteroids regimens noted in a Taiwanese observational study of AECOPD.68 There have been relatively few studies of the use of nebulized corticosteroids for exacerbations, as an alternative to systemic steroids.",
