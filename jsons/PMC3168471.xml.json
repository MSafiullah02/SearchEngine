            "text": "Determining the amount of infectious virus is a crucial issue for any virologist. To date, different methods have been used for viral titration depending on the virus concerned. The most popular ones are the plaque forming units (PFU) [1] and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) [2]. They are used for cytopathic viruses (e.g. HIV-1, poliovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, measles virus, etc\u2026) and are based on serial dilutions of the virus-containing samples and observation of the appearance of a cytopathic effect (CPE) in a cell monolayer. The PFU technique measures the number of virus particles capable of forming plaques per volume unit, and accounts for the replication potency of the virions, i.e. it is a functional measure. The PFU assay is laborious, poorly automatable, and requires several hours to several days according to the speed of virus growth and propagation. It also suffers from subjectivity because of the tedious manual plaque counting and possible plaque-like defects in the cell monolayer. The TCID50 method is a statistical derivative of the PFU assay. Instead of counting individual plaques, multiple replicates of each virus dilution are made and the TCID50 titer is calculated from the 50% endpoint where half of the replicates contained at least one PFU. Wells with destroyed cell monolayers are easily counted either manually under the microscope or automatically using a viable colorimetric assay. TCID50 values are intrinsically discontinuous, and the value coverage is non-homogeneous (i.e. intervals between two discontinuous values are not identical) as illustrated in Figure 1. Therefore, increasing the measurement accuracy would require a number of replicates high enough to discourage routine usage. Handling and time requirements of TCID50 and PFU methods are comparable. With both assays, virus titration is more difficult with cells growing in suspension.",

Such titration procedures have been developed for influenza viruses, adenoviruses, HIV-1, SV40, human coronaviruses, hepatitis A virus, as well as for recombinant and/or virus-like particles [3]\u2013[13]. Many of these techniques are based on the identification of infected cells at the single cell level using immunodetection of viral proteins (structural or glycoproteins) by flow cytometry [9],[7],[13]\u2013[14]. In such studies, the virus titer is calculated from the proportion of infected cells (i.e. positively labeled) after exposure of a given number of indicator cells to a given virus suspension volume. In each case, the assumption is made that one cell is infected by a single infectious virus particle. However, at a too high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (i.e. the ratio of infectious virus particle per cell) such an assumption becomes erroneous, leading to an underestimation of virus titers. Indeed, the higher the MOI, the higher the probability of multiple viruses infecting a single cell. Likewise, secondary infections of cells by newly produced viruses during the assay lead to overestimation of the virus titer.",

In addition, the assay could be used to approximate the duration of a single replication cycle. Our method was validated by the strong correlation found with the TCID50 technique over a large set of samples. The assay lasts less than two days which favorably compares with the \u223c1\u20132 week duration of the conventional PFU or TCID50 methods currently used for MV titration.",

In the latter case, titer accuracy required the blocking of cell growth by the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin over the 2-day measurement period.",

            "text": "We have used TCID50 titration method as a reference for the validation of our rapid titration technique. TCID50 is based on the end-point dilution of the virus at which a cytopathic effect (CPE) is detected in 50% of the cell culture replicates infected by a given amount of virus suspension [2]. The latter was serially diluted in 0.25 ml of DMEM medium supplemented with 6% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics (culture medium) by serial transfer of 0.027 ml (i.e. ten-fold dilution) in the first row of a 96 well plate. When diluting the virus suspension, each micropipette tip ought to be changed at every dilution to avoid uneven distribution of infectious particles that remain adsorbed on the tip. Subsequently, 0.030 ml of each dilution was distributed vertically, i.e. 8 replicates for each dilution. Permissive cells, i.e. Vero cells, (10,000 cells in 0.2 ml) were seeded in each well, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% C02 and humid atmosphere. CPE induced by measles virus could be observed under the microscope after 3\u20134 days, but because CPE located in the well edge could hardly be spotted, the final counting of wells with CPE was done after 10 days. This incubation time can be much shorter for quicker growing viruses (i.e. 1\u20132 days for VSV). To avoid underestimation of virus titer, the incubation time should be adapted to the virus species and physicochemical conditions used for virus propagation. TCID50 was then calculated using the formula:where \u201cAbove 50%\u201d dilution is the last dilution expressed as the denominator of 1 (i.e. 250 for 1/250 dilution) for which \u226550% wells display CPE, (\u201cAbove 50%\u201d and \u201cBelow 50%\u201d values are fraction of wells with CPE at the last dilution for which \u226550% wells display CPE and fraction of wells with CPE at the next dilution, respectively, and v the virus volume (in ml) from the undiluted sample used to inoculate the wells.",

Preferably, plate the cells in the morning and infect them in the afternoon. Alternatively, inoculate the cells just after seeding. In that case perform the seed and inoculation in the afternoon. Do not seed the cells the day prior to the inoculation because of resulting change in cell number due to cell growth. The cell number seeded should be carefully adjusted since it is part of the formulae to calculate the virus titer in IU/ml (see below). Likewise, during the assay, cell growth should be very limited hence cell plating and infection on the same day. Indeed any overgrowth of uninfected cells versus infected cells during the titer assay will result in the underestimation of the virus titer (see also the application for titration of HIV-1 below).",

Six independent titrations of a given viral stock of MV-Schwarz strain gave a similar titer with 1% variation compared to 1.5% using the TCID50 titration method for the same sample. This demonstrates that the flow cytometry-based titration method is reproducible. Furthermore, titers of near one hundred MV stocks measured by both flow cytometry and TCID50 assay showed a high level of correlation (Fig. 3, r = 0.930, 2\u03b1<0.001).",

In the case of MV-Halle strain, the flow cytometry analysis was performed at 6, 18, 24 and 48 hours post infection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 5, panel \u201cA\u201d). The distribution of MV infected cells inoculated with the largest volume (0.03 ml, green histogram) was already close to 100% at 6 h.p.i., but the expression level of F glycoprotein continued to increase up to 18 h.p.i. to remain stable at later time points. This could be interpreted as 18 hours being the time required to reach the maximal expression of F glycoprotein at the surface of an infected cell. When the cells were infected with smaller inoculums, the histograms of infected cells were progressively and regularly shifted to the left. This held true until 18 h.p.i. At 24 h.p.i., the inoculation with the second largest volume (0.010 ml) resulted in a peak shift that partially overlapped with that observed with 0.030 ml (Fig. 5, compare pink and green histograms). At the last time point studied (48 h.p.i.), histograms from the first five virus inputs almost completely overlapped, and even a very small inoculum (MOI as low as 10\u22124) gave rise to a significant percentage of infected cells (black histogram). The time interval allowing maximal expression of the viral gene with the highest inoculum, but not allowing similar expression levels with a lower inoculum size was thus considered to represent the duration of a single virus replication.",

FIP was added at 6 h.p.i. to block any secondary infection. Histogram profiles of MV-Schwarz infected cells observed for each inoculum size at 18 h.p.i. were very similar to the non-treated cultures (Fig. 6, compare panel \u201cb\u201d with panel \u201ca\u201d), thus excluding any detectable contribution of secondary infection when counting the number of infected cells at 18 h.p.i. Second, we added a potent neutralizing antiserum at 6 h.p.i. to prevent secondary infection by MV-eGFP virus. While such treatment almost completely abolished infection, the delayed addition of the antiserum by 6 hours did not interfere with the virus titration (Fig. 6). This strongly suggests that the time interval we have graphically selected as described in Fig. 5 is close to a single virus infection cycle and is optimal to quantify any given infectious virus sample.",

As HIV-1 infection is rather slow, a kinetics experiment was done over 72 hours. To overcome any interference of cell number changes due to proliferation during the titration assay, the experiment was duplicated in the presence of aphidicolin, a reversible inhibitor of the DNA polymerase. Indeed, after one day lag period, cells started to proliferate to double in number within two days of infection (Fig. 7B) and stop growing thereafter. The aphidicolin treatment prevented any increase in cell number without affecting cell viability over the first 48 h. Virus titration over a wide range of inoculation volumes was found to be more reliable in the presence than in the absence of aphidicolin (compare Fig. 7C with Fig. 7D online), and titers determined after 48 h of culture were within the error range of that determined by the TCID50 assay.",

Moreover, it could be used to titer non-replicative virus particles (e.g. lentiviral vectors), and a large number of virus samples may be compared simultaneously thanks to limited handling and high precision. However, there are two major limitations: (i) the detection limit is 104 IU/ml, which prevents its use for titration of clinical samples that often have a low virus load, and (ii) it is not recommended for viruses (mutants, etc.) with replication cycles exceeding more than 2 days. Alternative methods have been designed based on the measure of either the genome content of a viral suspension [12] or cell-associated viral nucleic acids by quantitative real-time PCR after end point dilution of the infecting virus (PCR infectivity assay) [29]\u2013[30]. However, the obtained viral nucleic acid values have to be calibrated using an infectious virus reference, and any change in the [nucleic acid/infectious unit] ratio prevents the accurate determination of the number of infectious particles. The advantages/disadvantages and specific required equipment of every titration methods have been listed in Table 2 as a helpful tool to choose the most suitable titration procedure.",

Furthermore, it could be easily automated [31]. Titers obtained through this technique correlate significantly with those determined by the classical TCID50 method but with higher accuracy and a 3-fold lower range of confidence limit. Such a method may be particularly beneficial for studies requiring titration of large numbers of MV stocks and especially when strict deadlines should be respected. In principle this method can be adapted to titer any virus for which a viral protein can be easily detected by flow cytometry, including recombinant viruses carrying a fluorescent reporter gene (or any gene encoding a cell surface protein that could be immunolabelled) and the use of indicator cells with an endogenous reporter gene that is inducible upon virus infection (see Table 1 for setting up steps of a new virus titration assay). The method is not suitable for titration of viruses (e.g. recombinant viruses, mutants, etc.) which replication cycle takes more than 30 h unless the cell proliferation is prevented. Indeed, the accuracy of virus titration critically relies on the precision of seeded cell number that is used in the formulae to calculate the titer. Any significant cell growth during the assay may result in the underestimation virus titer because infected cells usually grow slower than uninfected cells. This method could prove useful to titrate HIV and HIV molecular clones designed to undergo a single viral cycle. Moreover, this method also allows determination of the duration of a virus replication cycle, a key parameter for the accuracy of the virus titration.",
