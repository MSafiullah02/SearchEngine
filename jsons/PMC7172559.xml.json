Due to the presence of the SARS CoV-2 virus in stool,14,15 gastrointestinal symptoms may represent a nosocomial infection risk, but disease transmission via stool has not been a prominent clinical entity. Severe renal and hepatic dysfunction that spares the lungs has been observed, as have electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities suggestive of myocardial injury. Disease sufficiently severe to require ICU admission skews toward patients >60 years old, and those with medical comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or cardiovascular disease. Even generally healthy older patients appear at increased risk for severe disease. Menalso seem to beat increased risk for disease progression. Consistent with other United States reports,16 a trend toward younger patients requiring ICU admission for severe disease has been noted.",

Because the pulmonary reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection may involve host inflammation not unlike cytokine storm syndromes,18 other inflammatory biomarkers may enhance COVID-19 detection or prognostication and are being monitored. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been elevated and appear to correlate with the severity of illness. Elevations in ferritin levels are modest but may also assist, as may interleukin (IL-6) levels.

Antiviral therapies include (among others) remdesivir, lopinavir, and nitazoxanide. Aminoquinolines have generated interest as a prophylactic and/or disease-slowing agent25 and an ECG to determine QTc interval before initiating hydroxychloroquine therapy and ongoing telemetry may reduce the risk of aminoquinolone-associated cardiac toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine can only be given orally and is thus unavailable to patients with vomiting or gastrointestinal bleeding. Remdesivir is available only via clinical trial and current exclusions include thresholds of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations, creatinine clearance, and vasopressor requirements. The remdesivir/lopinavir combination may interact with medications such as clopidogrel, tacrolimus, apixaban, and statins. Whether inhaled or intravenous, no consensus on steroid use exists clinically, although published observations cite empiric use in up to 30% of patients.7 The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is increasingly used for the treatment of cytokine release (storm) syndrome.",

Although the relationship between age, comorbidities, and COVID-19\u2013associated respiratory failure described in early reports has been replicated in our clinical observations,4 other observations represent new manifestations of the disease. Among these are clinically severe infections in younger patients and a wide diversity of presenting symptoms, including altered mental status, hepatic, myocardial, and kidney injury, and prolonged periods of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These observations suggest that critical care of severe COVID-19 is likely to evolve rapidly, and the tactical management of critical care resources will need to keep pace. The most dynamic focus is likely to be the search for more consistently effective treatments. A therapeutic ability to alter the clinical course of severe COVID-19 infection has the potential to improve critical care management dramatically.",
