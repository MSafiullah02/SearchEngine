In fact, we have never really defeated viruses (actually, human beings and viruses are a process in which the priest climbs a foot, and the devil climbs ten). When something is strong enough to threaten human security, and a war occurs as a result, it should also be a global war, that is, a world war! We are now facing a powerful enemy -COVID-19 [1] ! The consumption of human, material and financial resources brought about by this campaign should not be underestimated, but we believe that it is controllable. Here, we appeal all governments and people to join hands to fight against the virus, and we should not expect to get lucky or despise it. We hope that this global crisis started with the virus and will end with its elimination!",
