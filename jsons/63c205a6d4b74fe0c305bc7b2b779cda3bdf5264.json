The spectrum of disease can range from asymptomatic infections to severe disease with dehydration, which can be fatal. Diarrheal disease continues to be a major cause of mortality in young children, particularly in developing countries. Prior to 1972, the etiology of most episodes of gastroenteritis was unknown, and cases were attributed to a multitude of causes, including teething, weaning, diet, old age, drugs, and malnutrition, as well as infections. Intensive investigation of enteric infections in the past three decades has resulted in the discovery of many new viral agents filling in the 'diagnostic gap' in diarrheal disease. With the identification of the Norwalk virus, rotavirus, astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and other caliciviruses in the 1970s and subsequently, it has become increasingly clear that viruses cause a significant proportion of the enteric illnesses that did not earlier have a defined etiology. With improvements in sanitation and hygiene, and better standards of living, the proportion of diarrheal disease attributed to bacteria has decreased, resulting in an increase in the proportion of cases associated with viral infections.

Infections with gastroenteritis viruses differ from bacterial enteric infections in that they affect children in both developing and developed countries, suggesting that they may also be transmitted by means unrelated to contaminated food or water.

Of the 'non-group A' rotaviruses, group B rotavirus has been identified in epidemic outbreaks of severe diarrhea in adults in China and in symptomatic infections in children. Outbreaks of diarrhea due to group C rotavirus have been identified in Asia, Europe, and South and North America, but are not common. Human caliciviruses, consisting mainly of noroviruses and sapoviruses, are associated mainly with milder cases of gastroenteritis in children, causing greater than 20% of diarrheal disease in children in the community.

Noroviruses are responsible for an estimated 67% of all illnesses caused by known foodborne pathogens and for 96% of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. Many outbreaks can be associated with the consumption of primarily or secondarily contaminated foods. Shellfish and fruit implicated in outbreaks have been shown to be contaminated at the site where these foods are harvested or produced, whereas other foods, such as salads, cold foods, and sandwiches, have caused outbreaks after being contaminated by food handlers at the site of food preparation. Shellfish, in particular oysters and clams that are raw or insufficiently cooked, is associated with noroviral outbreaks, frequently occurring because these shellfish filter contaminated seawater to feed and hence result in a concentration of virus. Foodborne outbreaks due to rotaviruses, parvoviruses, and astroviruses are also occasionally reported. Water is also a common source of outbreaks and may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools, and ice machines.

Coronaviruses, toroviruses, the Aichi virus, and picobirnaviruses have also been found to be associated with diarrhea in some studies, but definitive data are not yet available. Similarly, in conditions such as HIV, it has been difficult to obtain definitive data on the role of enteric viruses in the causation of symptoms. The study of rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and astroviruses has been facilitated greatly by the ability to propagate these viruses in cell culture, which has allowed the production of reagents for use in diagnostic studies, a better understanding of factors correlated with immunity to infection, and the elucidation of each virus's life cycle.

The mature virus particles are triple layered, approximately 70 nm in diameter, and possess icosahedral symmetry. The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of doublestranded RNA, which code for 6 structural viral proteins and 6 nonstructural proteins. Of the nonstructural proteins, NSP4 is of particular interest, as it has enterotoxin-like activity and can induce diarrhea in mice. The classification of rotavirus into 7 different groups (A-G) is based on the antigenic specificity of the VP6 capsid proteins. Of the 7 groups, only groups A, B, and C are known to infect humans. Severe, life-threatening disease in children worldwide is caused predominantly by group A rotaviruses. Variability in the genes encoding the two outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 forms the basis of the current strain typing of group A rotaviruses into G and P genotypes, respectively. All known G serotypes correspond with genotypes; more P genotypes than serotypes have been identified. The rapid evolution of rotaviruses by a variety of mechanisms provides one of the major challenges in epidemiological studies. These mechanisms include genetic drift, where an accumulation of point mutations generates genetic lineages leading to the emergence of antibody escape mutants, and genetic shift through gene reassortment during dual infection of a single cell.

The highest attack rate is usually among infants and young children 6 to 24 months old. Neonatal infections are largely asymptomatic. Deaths from rotavirus gastroenteritis may occur from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

These cuplike depressions are more prominent in some strains, particularly the sapoviruses, leading to the characteristic Star of David appearance from which caliciviruses get their name. Caliciviruses (family Caliciviridae) are a group of nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The genome is 7.5 to 7.7 kilobases in length and has three open reading frames (ORFs). Noroviruses can be genetically classified into five different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, and GV) which can be further divided into different genetic groups or genotypes. Genogroup II, the most prevalent human genogroup, presently contains 17 genotypes. Genogroups I, II, and IV infect humans, whereas genogroup III is associated with bovine infections and genogroup V has recently been isolated in mice. Noroviruses were named after the places where the outbreaks occurred. Recently a numeric classification system has been proposed based on numbering genogroups with Roman numerals and genotypes with numbers. For example, the genogroup II norovirus, Lordsdale virus, is a member of genotype 4, and therefore classified as a GII.4 norovirus. GII.4 viruses account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe.

In volunteer studies, infection by the Norwalk virus induces a specific IgG, IgA, and IgM serum antibody response, even in persons with preexisting antibodies. After norovirus infection, immunity appears to last for a few months but there is little or no evidence of long-term protection. Volunteer studies conducted in the 1970s also suggest that some people are resistant to Norwalk virus challenge. Recently two host factors have been identified that may contribute to this resistance to infection. In volunteer studies homozygous recessives for the a (1,2) fucosyltransferases gene (FUT2), who do not express H type-1 oligosaccharide were resistant to infection with Norwalk virus (nonsecretors).

In children, age-appropriate diet should be continued during oral rehydration and following intravenous rehydration. Anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents, and antibiotics should not be given to children, although anti-emetics and anti-diarrheals may be used in adults. Studies have shown that antirotavirus immunoglobulin as bovine hyperimmune colostrum or human milk may decrease the frequency and duration of rotavirus diarrhea. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei GG and Saccharomyces boulardii reduce the frequency and duration of diarrhea. Racecadotril, an enkephalinase inhibitor, has been shown in some studies to be useful in treating rotaviral diarrhea in children. Zinc supplements have been suggested to reduce severity and duration of illness.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Management of Viral Gastroenteritis"}, {"text": "Preventive measures can limit the number of episodes of viral gastroenteritis both within the home and in institutions. Diaper-changing areas should be separate from food preparation areas. Diapers should be disposed of directly in the changing area and should be placed in closed bags. Hands should be washed after contact with soiled diapers and clothing. Interruption of transmission of the infection is extremely important, especially in hospitals and centers that care for small children. Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce hygiene measures, such as handwashing, and clean all surfaces with suitable disinfectants. As viruses do not replicate outside a host, decreasing the potential inoculum is key to preventing further infection of susceptible hosts. Further preventive measures in childcare facilities and hospitals include isolation and cohorting of ill children. Asymptomatic infections probably also play an important role in the spread of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Management of Viral Gastroenteritis"}, {"text": "Studies with vaccines against group A rotavirus began in 1982. The first vaccine developed was the tetravalent human-rhesus reassortant vaccine, which induces protection against the four main rotavirus serotypes, G1-G4. Efficacy studies showed a reduction in the appearance of severe gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus in vaccinated children, and the vaccine was approved in the United States in 1998. However, the detection of an increase in the risk of intussusception after vaccination led to its suspension. In 2006, two licensed vaccines became commercially available. These are Rotateq, a live oral attenuated pentavalent vaccine from Merck which is recommended by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to be given at 2, 4, and 6 months with the last dose administered no later than 32 weeks, and Rotarix from GlaxoSmithKline, a human strain derived monovalent live oral vaccine given in two doses at 2 and 4 months. Rotateq is licensed in the United States and Rotarix in many countries in Europe and South America. These vaccines need to be evaluated in settings where there is marked diversity of rotaviruses and infection occurs at a younger age, as in developing countries. Owing to the high cost of these vaccines, vaccine manufacturers in developing countries have initiated the process of formulating and testing vaccines based on local strains, which may address the issues of cost and heterotypic immunity in settings where different viruses circulate. DNA-based and virus-like particle vaccines may also provide an alternate method of prevention in the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "Studies on virus-like particle-based vaccines against Norwalk virus have also been initiated with capsid proteins expressed in plants inducing an antibody response in experimental models.
