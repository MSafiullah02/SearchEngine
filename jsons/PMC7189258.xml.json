However, studies have shown that acute cardiac injury is a common complication in COVID-19 patients.[3],[4] Indeed, a study in the early stage of the disease outbreak showed that 12% of 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had acute myocardial injury, which was characterized by a significant increase in the level of hypersensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI).[5] The heart autopsy results of three COVID-19 cases revealed pathological changes of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, partial cardiomyocyte degeneration and necrosis, mild interstitial congestion and edema, accompanied by a small number of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophil infiltration.[6] Additionally, a meta-analysis showed that hs-cTnI was significantly increased in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with mild forms.[7] Therefore, myocardial injury is likely to be an important prognostic factor for COVID-19. Here, we summarize the current literature to explore the correlation between myocardial injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19.",

Single-cell data analysis identified that human myocardial cells express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and that higher expression is present in patients with heart failure.[18] SARS-CoV-2 may invade cells by binding to ACE2, causing direct damage to cardiomyocytes. However, the autopsy results of COVID-19 cases failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus components in myocardial tissue by electron microscope observation, immunohistochemical staining or PCR.[6] SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cause myocardial injury through overactivetion of the immune system, with the release of a large number of cytokines and cytokine storms.[19],[20] In addition, pulmonary infection-induced hypoxemia, respiratory failure and shock might lead to insufficient myocardial oxygen supply; after infection, the burden of the heart increases, and the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand leads to myocardial injury.[21] Overall, more studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial injury.",

This large sample size report also showed that the case fatality rate was associated with disease severity, as all death cases were among critical patients. Our meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury have a higher mortality rate. A previous meta-analysis also reported a significant increase in cTnI in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that myocardial injury might be related to COVID-19 severity.[7] Therefore, the existence of myocardial injury should be regarded as an important index in the risk stratification of disease severity and death for COVID-19. Continuous monitoring of myocardial injury markers and cardiac function during hospitalization should be strengthened. For patients with myocardial injury, we believe that doctors should conduct comprehensive treatment, including correcting hypoxemia and improving myocardial oxygen supplementation, applying immunoglobulins to inhibit the excessive immune response, improving myocardial energy metabolism, and maintaining water-electrolyte balance, to improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.",
