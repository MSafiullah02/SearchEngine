It is also 89 used off-label as a mucolytic in other diseases, including ARDS (8, 9) . A mechanism by which 90 dornase alfa might improve ventilation is by reducing the DNA-mediated viscosity of neutrophil-91 rich secretions (10). There are multiple sources for the DNA in mucoid sputum, one of which is 92 neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Recently, we collaboratively reported that in the discarded 93 serum of patients with COVID-19, the levels of NETs were increased and were correlated with 94 lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (11). Targeting 95 NETs reduces mortality in animal models of ARDS (12). Despite recognition that mucolytic 96 treatment may be beneficial for patients with COVID-19, administration of nebulized 97 medications, such as dornase alfa, have been limited due to risk of viral aerosolization. If risk of 98 viral aerosolization can be avoided, dornase alfa may benefit patients with severe COVID-19. by 99 acting as a mucolytic and by reducing NET levels in the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation 100 and ventilation.

Nebulized dornase alfa is 30 FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 31 contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients 32 with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute 33 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with 34 severe COVID-19-acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized 35 drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for 36 staff.
