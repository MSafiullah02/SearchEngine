Other members of Pestivirus, Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Border disease virus (BDV), infect pigs and sheep, respectively (Paton et al., 1995, Becher et al., 1999).

For this reason, an alternative method which is able to amplify long RNA spans was developed. Previous reports have described the amplification of long DNA templates from eukaryotic genomes or molecular clones (Cheng et al., 1994). LD-PCR methods capable of amplifying long viral DNA genomes have been described (Barnes, 1994). Complete double stranded genomic RNA fragments of 0.8\u20136.8 kb have been successfully amplified (Potgieter et al., 2002). Complete genomes and long genomic regions of up to 10 kb long from other positive stranded RNA viruses have been reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR (Lindberg et al., 1997, Lindberg and Andersson, 1999, Holterman et al., 2000, Lu et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2001). Long fragments of up to 20 kb from coronavirus genomic RNA have been successfully amplified by using a purification step previous to the RT (Thiel et al., 1997). This success strongly suggested the possibility of amplifying the whole pestiviral genome directly from total RNA; that is, avoiding viral RNA purification procedures.",

In pestiviruses, the success of overlapping cDNA amplification can rely on many trial and error assays since primers capable of amplifying one viral isolate or species are usually not necessarily suitable for another (e.g. Ridpath and Bolin, 1995, Avalos-Ramirez et al., 2001, Oberste et al., 2002). The amplification of long or full-length RNA spans using the methods described herein could represent an improvement compared to sequencing many short overlapping cDNA fragments. If the regions in which we located L-RT-PCR primers are relatively conserved, it could be possible to use one set of primers to amplify the genome of many diverse viral genotypes. In the worst case one would need to design primers for each genotype. However, in this situation the number of primers to design and test would be dramatically lower than in the case in which short overlapping PCR fragments are used. Once long amplicons are obtained, they can be easily sequenced by primer walking or shotgun strategies.",
