The prevalence of left ventricular (LV) failure (3/18 [17%] vs. 14/23 [61%], p = 0.009), ACP (3/18 [17%] vs. 11/23 [48%], p = 0.051), and severe ACP (1/18 [5.5%] vs. 8/23 [35%], p = 0.054) was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients. Hypovolemic and hyperkinetic phenotypes were similarly observed in both groups (Table 1). Despite similar tidal volume and PEEP level, COVID-19 patients had significantly higher P/F ratio and respiratory-system compliance, and lower driving pressure than flu patients (Table 1). Pulmonary embolism was identified in none of COVID-19 patients but in one flu patient with ACP. COVID-19 patients with ACP tended to exhibit lower respiratory-system compliance (34, 32, and 30 mL/cmH2O) when compared to others (40 [31\u201345] mL/cmH2O). Hemodynamic profile of COVID-19 patients remained stable during the first 3 days of ICU stay (Table 2).\n",

Depressed indices of RV systolic function and elevated central venous pressure reflecting systemic venous congestion reflect the higher prevalence of RV failure in flu ARDS patients (Table 1). This presumably results from the lower P/F, higher driving pressure, and lower respiratory-system compliance observed in this group. COVID-19 patients with ACP tended to have lower respiratory-system compliance than their counterparts, presumably due to distinct ARDS phenotypes [6]. This pilot study is limited by its small sample size and the retrospective comparison with historical flu-related ARDS patients.",
