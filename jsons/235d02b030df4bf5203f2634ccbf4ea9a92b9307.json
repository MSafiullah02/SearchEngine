We congratulate and applaud Minotti et al' important work, but this study drew conclusions only based on the systematic review without a meta-analysis. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess whether immunosuppression and immunodeficiency are associated with increased risk of severe disease and death in patients with COVID-19.",

We also performed sensitivity analyses by excluding studies published in Chinese to assess the stability of results. 2176 records were obtained through systematic electronic searches.

Sensitivity analysis indicated the result (OR = 4.32, 95%CI: 1.00 to 18.64) did not change substantially after excluding the Chinese study [3] . We found that immunodeficiency was associated with a 1.55-fold pandemic, as well as the care and treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients with immunosuppression and immunodeficiency/HIV. However, our study was limited by small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution. As more data becomes available, these findings should be re-analyzed to provide more reliable evidence.",

Sensitivity analysis by excluding the Chinese study [9] showed a similar result (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 0.67 to 3.47). The subgroup analysis based on countries indicated the association between immunodeficiency and severe COVID-19 disease in China (OR = 2.15, 95%CI: 0.50 to 9.22) was stronger than that in the USA (OR = 1.34, 95%CI: 0.51 to 3.50), Figure 2. One study [6] involving 1,590 patients reported the data on immunodeficiency between dead and surviving COVID-19 patients. The result revealed that there was no correlation (P = 1.000) between immunodeficiency and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.Our study showed that immunosuppression and immunodeficiency were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, although the statistical differences were not significant. These findings suggest that healthcare professionals need to be alert to the increased risk of serious diseases associated with COVID-19 5 infection in patients with immunosuppression and immunodeficiency/HIV. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, special preventive and protective measures should be provided for patients with immunosuppression and immunodeficiency/HIV. Future researchers should focus on the treatment and management strategies for patients with immunosuppression and immunodeficiency/HIV during the COVID-19",
