In order to prevent false-negative results, a one-step multiplex RT-PCR was optimized. It contains two dual-labelled fluorogenic probes to quantify the 5\u2032 noncoding region of enterovirus and detect an internal positive control. In the present study, 104 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected during an outbreak of enteroviral meningitis were analyzed using this method. Amplification of the internal positive control was effective in all but two specimens, confirming the absence of PCR inhibitors and allowing the results of amplification to be validated. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR was 96.8%, while that of cell culture was 34.9%. Genomic viral loads found ranged between 3.3 and 5.9 log 10 copies per milliliter of cerebrospinal fluid (mean, 4.8 log 10 copies/ml). This fluorogenic enterovirus RT-PCR allows large numbers of samples to be screened rapidly. Moreover, its sensitivity and reproducibility make it highly reliable. With these characteristics, the enterovirus RT-PCR can be a useful tool that may offer considerable benefit in the clinical management of patients with enteroviral infections.",

It is estimated that they cause 70-90% of the cases of viral meningitis [1, 2] . Conventional laboratory diag-nosis of EV meningitis relies on isolation of the virus in cell culture with several cell lines. Observation of cell cultures for the development of a cytopathic effect continues for about 15 days and is then followed by neutralization typing. Besides being time-consuming, this method is frequently unsuccessful because of the small volume of samples such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the difficulty of propagating certain EV types in cell culture [3] . As an alternative method, therefore, the use of molecular biology for the detection of EV genomes is of considerable interest.",

During the optimization of our previous fluorogenic RT-PCR [15] , we overcame problems of sensitivity related to the secondary structures present in the 5\u2032 noncoding region of the EV genome and problems associated with PCR inhibitors by using PCR adjuvants such as T4 gene 32 protein and polyvinylpyrrolidone [15] . In order to detect PCR inhibitors without a second run, we decided to work on the incorporation of an internal control. Real-time PCR assays allow the choice of internal controls totally different from those of the amplification target, as it is possible to evaluate competition between the two reactions with the amplification kinetic. The two amplification reactions must be independent. Thus, our internal control is just an internal quality control of the amplification, and its amplification at the same level (CT=35 cycles) over a range of 50-5\u00d710 5 copies of EVs RNA standard improve its usability. The intra-and inter-assay variability values of 2.2% and 5.5% obtained with low numbers of EV RNA standard copies agree with those found in work on other TaqMan RT-PCRs (3.4% and 6.2%) [17, 18] . The presence of PCR inhibitors in 2 of our 104 (1.9%) specimens confirms the importance of an internal control for RT-PCR assays in CSF, as already demonstrated by other authors [13, 14] who found amplification inhibitors in 2.6% and 0.4% of their CSF specimens, respectively, using the competitive RT-PCR Amplicor EV (Roche Molecular Systems, USA). Since the exact nature of these inhibitors is unknown, their effects cannot be excluded, even by using numerous amplification facilitators [19] .",

Previous studies have shown that early diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis would provide potential cost savings by facilitating early patient discharge, discontinuation of inappropriate antibiotic therapy, and elimination of unnecessary investigation [25] . This fluorogenic enterovirus RT-PCR allows a large number of samples to be screened rapidly during an epidemic, and its sensitivity, simplicity, and reproducibility make it a highly reliable and suitable tool in the clinical laboratory.",
