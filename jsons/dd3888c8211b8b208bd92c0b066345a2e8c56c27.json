This is the idea that danger brings out the worst in us: panic, antisocial behaviour, and fi erce competition for material and physical resources (see [1] for a review). Moral transgression and the abandonment of social norms may sometimes occur and certainly colour public imagination, but this behaviour tends to be rare. Sociological and psychological studies show that, under stress, people frequently remain calm and cooperative [1, 2] . What's more, rather than selfi sh avoidance, it is cooperation and contact-seeking that are our primary responses to threat [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

This is the expectation that exposure to threat makes people abandon social niceties and, being naturally rivals, fall back into 'brutishness and misery'. Major newspapers report panic, with people running to shops to collect masks, hand sanitizers and food. Those behaviours are routinely qualifi ed as irrational: why rush to buy food when we are told that there will be no shortages? We do not doubt that humans can be irrational (we misevaluate large magnitudes; underestimate risks and value shortterm gain [7] ). At the individual level, however, it is rational to hoard food and toilet paper when we are told that we will have to stay at home for an indefi nite amount of time. It's not that we do not trust politicians, but we are right to be uncertain about the resilience of institutions, and the social contract in general, in the face of an unprecedented, unknown, and growing threat. Similarly, it is perfectly rational, at the individual level, to run for the exits when the building is on fi re. However, these self-oriented rational decisions are the ones on which we have to consciously refl ect [8] . Our initial, intuitive responses are, on the contrary, to be cooperative [9] .",

Rather than 'falling back' into selfi sh isolation, as in the Hobbesian picture, people who feel afraid, stressed, and threatened will not just seek social contact: they seek even more social contact [4, 11] . Research on disasters has shown that contact-seeking rather than distancing is the primary response to perceived danger, even if the latter is safer [3] . When we know there is something to lose, rather than to win, we are more prone to join others, both to diffuse stress and to reduce our feelings of responsibility [6] . Affi liative tendencies and contact-seeking would preferentially target individuals who are already familiar [3] . In their absence, people look for familiar places associated with close ones [3] . It is this, perhaps, that explains mass movements before confi nement rules are proclaimed. It is also possible that ad hoc groups emerge from scratch when threat arises, emerging from a feeling of 'common fate' [2] . Exodus away from dense city centers has occurred in several countries and has been criticized for its potentially disastrous epidemiological consequences.",
