Methods and Results: The Controlled Aerosol Test System (CATS) was designed to generate and condition a viable infective aerosol, pass it through a treatment technology and thence to the breathing zone of a mouse constrained in a Nose-Only Inhalation Exposure System (NOIES). A scanning mobility particle sizer and impingers at sampling ports were used to show that viability is preserved and particle size distribution (PSD) is acceptably uniform throughout the open CATS, including the 12 ports of the NOIES, and that a particle filter used caused the expected attenuation of particle counts. Conclusions: Controlled Aerosol Test System delivers uniformly to mice constrained in the NOIES a selectable dose of viral bioaerosol whose PSD and viable counts remain consistent for an hour. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study's characterization of CATS provides a new test system in which a susceptible small-animal model can be used as the detector in a quantitative method to evaluate the ability of respiratory protective technologies to attenuate the infectivity of an inspired pathogenic aerosol. This provides a major improvement over the use of viable bioaerosol collectors (e.g. impactors and impingers), which provide data that are difficult to relate to the attenuation of pathogenicity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Bioaerosols are known to be a transmission mechanism for many disease-causing organisms, including Legionella, smallpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses and rhinovirus (Fiegel et al. 2006) . However, the role of bioaerosols as an important natural transmission mechanism for influenza is actively debated (Tellier 2006 (Tellier , 2007a Brankston et al. 2007 ; Gardam and Lemieux 2007; Lee 2007; Lemieux et al. 2007; Tang and Li 2007) . One approach proposed to reduce the risk of infection by pathogenic bioaerosols, particularly to healthcare workers and first responders, is to incorporate an antimicrobial agent into the air filters of respiratory protection devices. Common antimicrobials can be applied to the surfaces of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), including quaternary ammonium compounds (Price et al. 1993) , N-halamines and silver (Foarde et al. 2000; Verdenelli et al. 2003; Cecchini et al. 2004; Sullivan 2006) , but these are expected to act only on captured particles to suppress contact transfer. Taylor et al. (1970) and Marchin and Fina (1989) showed the antimicrobial resin poly(styrene-4-[trimethylammonium]methyl triiodide) (PSTI) to be an effective, broad-spectrum disinfectant in aqueous environments. A patent (Messier 2000) has been issued for the use of PSTI as a constituent at the fibre surface of air filtration media, and in vitro studies have reported a 2-log (99%) increase in viable removal efficiency (VRE) after passage through air purification media incorporating PSTI compared to standard filtration systems (Heimbuch et al. 2004; Heimbuch and Wander 2006; Lee and Wu 2006; Lee et al. 2009 ). However, one PSTI-coated material rated as an N95 medium performed mechanically as an N99 filter (Stone 2010, pp. 54) , which obscured the role of PSTI in the measured VRE. Ratnesar-Shumate et al. (2008) proposed that the water-based mechanism proposed by Taylor et al.capture of I 2 from the surface of the I \u00c0 3 complex during collisions with passing microbescan be extended to describe a short, through-space capture process from treated fibres, induced by near collisions with bioaerosols as they penetrate an air filter medium. However, the in vitro assay they used includes a transfer step in waterwhich can interact indiscriminately with either background I 2 or I 2 captured by passing micro-organisms to provide a fast mechanism of devitalization. Lee et al. (2009) and Rengasamy et al. (2010) showed that water vapour has a role in the disinfection mechanism, and numerous examples have been reported in which proteins react competitively to consume I 2 (McFarlane 1956; Eninger et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2009 ) by several mechanisms. Quenching experiments collecting filtered bioaerosols in solutions containing thiosulfate or bovine serum albumin showed the process of devitalization by captured I 2 in air to be relatively slow (Lee et al. 2009 ) and possibly unimportant on the time scale of inspiration behind an FFR. Thus, if protection is to be improved significantly by passing exposure to PSTI during filtration, the protective process must occur at the point of contact with the respiratory mucosal surface (an aqueous medium containing potentially interfering proteins), which can be tested only by controlled, quantitative exposure experiments using an animal model. Experimental inhalation exposure systems are an established tool and the subject of several reviews (Drew and Laskin 1973; MacFarland 1983; Cheng and Moss 1995; Jaeger et al. 2006; Wong 2007) . Unrelated studies have demonstrated reduced rates of infection by adding filters to livestock housing (Hopkins and Drury 1971; Burmester and Witter 1972; Dee et al. 2005 Dee et al. , 2006a . However, the inhalation studies did not include filters and the animal studies examined only casual transmission between animals and did not expose the animals to a metered challenge of aerosol in a controlled design. Controlled delivery of graduated doses of infective aerosols through reactive and inert filters is a novel approach to measure the clinical significance of respiratory protection devices. Development and characterization of the delivery system described below is the necessary enabling step to realize this capability.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 211, "text": "(Fiegel et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 328, "end": 341, "text": "(Tellier 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 342, "end": 358, "text": "(Tellier , 2007a", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 359, "end": 380, "text": "Brankston et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 383, "end": 407, "text": "Gardam and Lemieux 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 408, "end": 417, "text": "Lee 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 418, "end": 438, "text": "Lemieux et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 439, "end": 456, "text": "Tang and Li 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 830, "end": 849, "text": "(Price et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 875, "end": 895, "text": "(Foarde et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 896, "end": 919, "text": "Verdenelli et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 920, "end": 941, "text": "Cecchini et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 942, "end": 956, "text": "Sullivan 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1066, "text": "Taylor et al.
