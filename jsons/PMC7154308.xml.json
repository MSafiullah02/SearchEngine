Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is an alpha-herpes virus assigned to the Iltovirus genus (Figure 1). ILT was one of the earliest diseases described for poultry (1925) and affects chickens and pheasants but rarely turkeys. Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV, Figure 2) belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and is the cause of turkey rhinotracheitis, originally reported in South Africa in the late 1970s, but it affects chickens also and is the \u201cyoungest\u201d of the three. IB, caused by a type 3 coronavirus (Figure 3), was first reported in 1931 but still flourishes. Despite years of attempting to control the diseases caused by these viruses by the use of vaccines, they are still present.\n\n\n",

Essentially this means that when affected birds have recovered from the acute phase of infection, the virus assumes a non-infectious state and resides in the trigeminal ganglia (Williams et al., 1993), though the flock appears to be in normal health. Live ILT vaccines can also become latent (Hughes et al., 1991). The consequences are that latent virus can become reactivated by factors such as stress or onset of lay (Hughes et al., 1989), so that such a flock can become an unrecognised source of infection (Williams et al., 1992). There are no known wild bird reservoirs of this virus and there is no evidence that it is egg transmitted (Bagust & Johnson, 1995).",

            "text": "Empirical attenuated ILT vaccines either of chick embryo origin (CEO) or tissue culture origin (TCO) have been used for many years with success (Guy & Garcia, 2008). Some time ago we discovered that the commercial vaccine used in the UK behaved in the same way as a field virus, that is, it had the same latency characteristics as wild type ILTV in the bird and persisted for life (Hughes et al., 1991). Thus, it was perceived that a significant proportion of disease could be due to vaccine virus becoming \u201cwild\u201d and recently referred to in the USA as \u201cvaccinal laryngotracheitis\u201d. Molecular analysis, as shown above, has confirmed that this is the case. However, Korean workers found that one of four conventional ILT vaccines protects against virus latency (Han & Kim, 2003). Despite the presence of ILTV strains genetically different from vaccine strains, Rodr\u00edguez-Avila et al. (2008) in the USA have recently shown that conventional vaccines are effective in protecting against them. Thus it appears that the fine genetic differences which differentiate field from vaccine viruses and which are helpful in epidemiological studies are not sufficiently different to require radically new vaccines",

In addition, because ILT vaccines are not usually given until 10 weeks of age or later, birds are vulnerable up to this point. As a result, several new approaches have been explored to produce a new generation of safer vaccines. These include the production of a glycoprotein G-deficient vaccine (Devlin et al., 2008), G being associated with latency and a fowl pox vector carrying ILTV genes (Davison et al., 2006) or glycoprotein G together with the haemagglutinin of Newcastle Disease virus (Sun et al., 2008). It remains to be seen whether vaccines of this type will prove to be more efficacious than the empirically derived vaccines.",

One suggestion has been transmission by long-distance migratory birds (Jones, 1996), although efforts to find evidence of infection in wild European species have not been fruitful. Perhaps even more puzzling is the fact that while subtype C has been present in turkeys in the USA, principally Minnesota, with its many lakes, while A and B are present in Central and South America, there is no apparent mixing of subtypes in the two regions, despite the migratory flight paths of wild waterfowl between the north and south. Evidence of aMPV infection in wild birds has been reported in the USA (Shin et al., 2002; Turpin et al., 2008), but this in itself does not mean that infected species are able to transmit infection to susceptible poultry.",

In chickens, live vaccines are incorporated into the vaccination programme at a different time from IB vaccines, since interference occurs (Cook et al., 2001), although aMPV vaccination simultaneously with Newcastle disease vaccines does not adversely affect the efficacy of either (Ganapathy et al., 2005). Killed vaccines are given by injection before the onset of lay but only after priming with live vaccines. Except for the USA, where subtype C is present, A and B are the prevalent subtypes elsewhere and vaccines against each of these two give good protection against the other (Cook et al., 1995). A and B type vaccines also give some protection against subtype C but not vice versa (Cook et al., 1999).",

Subtype A and B vaccines have been used successfully in most countries and in both species, where the disease is prevalent. In spite of this, several reports suggest that there is room for improved vaccines or at least closer attention to accurate vaccine delivery. For example in turkeys, some weeks after aMPV vaccination, respiratory disease sometimes occurs which has been diagnosed as TRT. This phenomenon been confirmed to be due to vaccine virus becoming virulent after recycling among birds which did not receive a dose of vaccine originally (Catelli et al., 2006).",

The spike is in two parts, S1 and S2 and the gene coding for the S1 spike has a hypervariable region which is liable to mutate or undergo reassortment with other IBVs, thus generating novel variant IBVs. The S1 spike is important in viral attachment, is a major component in development of immunity and has traditionally been important for cross-neutralisation, the original basis for IBV classification. The different types of IBV generally give little or no protection against heterologous types, although there are some exceptions. Important variants appear from time to time in a very unpredictable manner and are a constant challenge to vaccine strategies. Hence there is a constant need for surveillance of prevalent types.",

The most prevalent genotypes were Massachusetts and the major variant 793B (4/91 or CR88) (Figure 5). On the basis of nucleotide sequence shared identity, approximately 50% of each were considered to be vaccine virus (H120, MA5, 4/91, IB88, etc). The next most common genotypes were two new important field types: Italy 02 and a virus originally detected in China called QX (Worthington et al., 2008). The origins of Italy 02 are unknown (Dolz et al., 2006) but QX originated in China in 1996 (Wang et al., 1998), though how it arrived in Europe is unknown. Italy 02 has behaved primarily as a respiratory pathogen, but QX has had more serious consequences, causing nephritis in young flocks and false layers in egg laying flocks. This survey is an example of the diversity of IBV genotypes in a region and the appearance of new ones. Considerable diversity has been well documented for USA, Australia and China and in recent years, reports of novel genotypes have been published from Brazil (Brandao et al., 2009), Argentina (Rimondi et al., 2009), Thailand (Pohuang et al., 2009), Malaysia (Zulperi et al., 2009) and Africa (Ducatez et al., 2009).\n",

            "text": "In regions where licensed vaccines are from the same genotype as the field challenge, then IB vaccines work well. However, where variants appear and persist and against which existing vaccines do not protect, then this presents a big problem. A number of possibilities exist for addressing the problem of a new important variant for which a new vaccine is perceived to be necessary.\n(1)Test the existing repertoire of vaccines. Sometimes protection can be offered by an unrelated vaccine. For example, D274 vaccine protects against 793B variant (Figure 6).(2)Develop an empirical vaccine by attenuation in eggs or perhaps cell culture. This is the traditional \u201cfire brigade\u201d method but is a long tedious process.(3)Use molecular techniques to engineer a vaccine for the new challenge virus that will not revert to virulence. Recent examples of this are modified DNA vaccination (Tian et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009) and a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine (Yang et al., 2009). One of the most promising of the new generation of vaccine appears to be the \u201cspike swapping\u201d technology, whereby using reverse genetics, an infectious clone is produced into which specific S1 spike genes can be incorporated, appropriate to the new variant (Casais et al., 2001). Variations on this theme have also included incorporation of nucleocapsid genes or specific cytokines to induce a broader immunity (Cavanagh et al., 2007).(4)Use two heterologous IBV vaccines (Cook et al., 1999). This method has been shown to be very successful, even though the mechanisms have not been elucidated to date. It is usual to first administer a Massachusetts-type vaccine followed by a variant (793B-type in Europe) offers wide protection against types which are different again (Figure 7). Such a programme has been shown to be efficacious against for example Italy 02 and QX (Jones et al., 2005, Figure 8); (Terregino et al., 2008; De Wit & van de Sande, 2009).(5)In ovo vaccination. This is under development (Tarpey et al., 2006) and is dependent on the strain of IBV not killing embryos.\n\n\n",

The main choice for future strategies in IBV control seems to be as follows: (i) production of a specific tailored vaccine, produced by molecular technology and designed to protect against the variant challenge virus. This has the advantage that once the virus \u201ccarrier\u201d is established, mechanisms for the insertion of the appropriate S1 spike gene (perhaps with accessory genes for cytokines etc., are now available. However, the question arises as to how many tailored vaccines the bird can take, if the numbers of variants in the challenge become large. (ii) The use of two different vaccines. This is simple to employ but is not guaranteed to succeed in every case and the mechanisms have not been fully established. However, unless a \u201cpan-IBV\u201d vaccine was to be produced (which is unlikely), this is a significant and very successful \u201cstop-gap\u201d approach.

Existing vaccines may be described as restraining rather than fully controlling these diseases.
