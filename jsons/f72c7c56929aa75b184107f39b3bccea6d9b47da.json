Foci of interstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage were observed during the whole course of the experiment. Repeated haemorrhage, oedema, and over-secretion of protein-rich fluid inevitably resulted in fibrosis of pulmonary tissues. These pathological changes reflect the changes that are seen in the early stage of clinical SARS cases [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . An important observation in these studies is that there was no SARS-related death in the infected animals and SARS infections in rhesus macaques were milder. The differences in clinical signs and symptoms, and pathological changes, in the experimentally infected rhesus macaques compared with human cases of SARS might be due, in part, to the presence of co-infections or secondary infections in human cases [21, 22] , whereas the monkeys used in this study were young and healthy.

In particular, the lung lesions in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were infrequent and limited to focal interstitial alveolar inflammation and oedema and lesions reflecting severe damage to alveolar and bronchial cell damage were not observed. Our results differ from those of Rowe et al [23] , who showed limited disease, and those of Fouchier et al [8] and Kuiken et al [24] , who showed in cynomolgus macaques a more severe pulmonary syndrome that resembled SARS in several ways. The reasons for these differences are not clear, but it should be noted that rhesus macaques of Chinese origin were used in our studies and viral RNA could be detected in all of the infected monkeys, the longest duration lasting to 16 days. In addition, virus could be isolated from five of eight infected monkeys and neutralizing antibody response persisted in the animals that were sacrificed at 60 days post-infection. Thus, based on the results of virus detection, immunological response, and pathological changes in the lungs of infected animals, we conclude that the rhesus macaque model of SARS is valuable.
