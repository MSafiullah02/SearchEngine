The Director of the World Health Organization officially assessed on March 11, 2020, that it could be characterized as a pandemic and advocated \u201ca comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact.\u201d1 The pandemic has led to severe shortages of many essential goods and services, presenting an unprecedented challenge to national health systems and determining a massive reshape of the commitment of hospitals and healthcare workers. As well as any other health service, a Department of Urology undergoes a deep reorganization. Recommendations and guidelines for the management of surgical procedures and clinical activities have been recently published by national and international panels.2\n,\n3 The development of telemedicine has been suggested as a pragmatic approach to reducing risk of transmission.4 Our objective is to assess the implementation and outcomes of telemedicine in a Department of Urology in a regional hospital in Northern Italy during the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.",
