Interestingly, After 5 days initial treatment, IL-10 in mild group (group B) was significantly dropped while still kept similar level in severe group (group A). The above results suggest the early high level of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines indicating a potentially cytokine storm-mediated disease severity, which was similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [14, 15] .

A larger cohort, change of immune response after infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be addressed in the key stage including admission, hospitalization, discharge and follow-up after cure in the near future. Despite that, our study the changed immune response in COVID-19 patients through down-regulated at the transcriptional levels involved in T cell activation and differentiation especially in severe patients. Although clinical blood laboratory findings did not show significantly differences after intinal treatment, IL-10 level, T cells proportions and related mRNA expression level changed with the disease progression. These findings will help us extend our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism, may help elucidate the COVID-19 infection and provide a basis for future novel immune therapeutic strategies. .
