We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications.

This disease, recognized as an infection with a new betacoronavirus by Dr Zhang Jixian from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, has been spreading exponentially in almost all countries around the world. The epicentre shifted from China to Europe in February/March 2020 and then to the USA in March/April 2020. Current data presenting information on international case numbers and case fatality are provided by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Coronavirus Resource Center (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdash board/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). 1, 2 There are several other web-based resources that provide informative graphics on the spread of the disease and the outcomes. The pandemic of COVID-19 has multiple medical, psychological, and socio-economic consequences. COVID-19 represents probably the greatest threat that societies will face in the 21st century. Therefore, understanding its pathophysiology and clinical implications, and development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are of primary importance.",

The cardiovascular (CV) system appears to have complex interactions with COVID- 19 . Published reports, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and personal communications and experience of the co-authors detail evidence of myocardial injury in 20-40% of hospitalized cases manifesting as cardiac chest pain, fulminant heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac death. Indeed, symptoms of cardiac chest pain and palpitations are the presenting features in some patients. [3] [4] [5] [6] While COVID-19 is non-discriminatory, involving both healthy persons and those with comorbid conditions, approximately half of those admitted to hospitals in Huabei province with COVID-19 had known comorbidities. The number of patients with comorbid conditions increased to about two-thirds in those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission or those that did not survive. Patients with preexisting CV conditions (hypertension in particular) had the highest morbidity (10.5%) following infection. 7, 8 Non-CV comorbidities, including diabetes, lung diseases, and obesity, the latter identified in current Italian and Dutch cohorts, are also major predictors of poor clinical outcomes. Similarly, in the recent analysis of 5700 Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in the New York City Area the most common comorbidities were hypertension (57%), obesity (42%), and diabetes (34%). 167 These aspects emphasize the importance of the need for multidisciplinary assessment and treatment, including CV evaluation and therapy, during the course of COVID-19 to reduce mortality.

There are four genera in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, namely the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. Of these, alpha-and betacoronaviruses infect mammals while the gamma-and deltacoronaviruses infect birds. There are seven coronaviruses that infect humans: the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and 229E, which tend to cause a mild illness in adults; the betacoronaviruses Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, which cause a severe respiratory illness; and OC43 and HKU1, which are associated with a mild illness. An example electron microscopy image of a betacoronavirus is shown in Figure 1 . COVID-19 is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, probably originating from bats following gain-of-function mutations within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the acquisition of a furinprotease cleavage site. It has been named by the WHO as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 9 Coronavirus receptor binding occurs via the spike protein (encoded by the structural S gene) which has two subunits. Subunit S1 mediates . . binding and a trimeric S2 stalk mediates fusion to the infected cell. The S1 subunit is divided into two domains, the N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and the C-terminal domain (S1-CTD). These regions mediate binding to a variety of cellular receptors containing carbohydrate or protein at their binding domains. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (and the alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63) all bind via the S1-CTD to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor ( Figure 2) . 9 SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for binding to ACE2 than SARS-CoV, and binding involves a larger number of interaction sites. 10, 11 A pre-requisite for binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is cleavage of the S protein of the virus by the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 12 (Figure 2) . Replication occurs via the RNAdependent RNA polymerase and involves discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs that encode six major open reading frames common to all coronaviruses and multiple accessory proteins.",

SARS-CoV-2 is more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus may be detected up to 72 h after application to these surfaces. 14 Patients with severe COVID-19 tend to have a high viral load and a long virus-shedding period. This finding suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 might be a useful marker for assessing disease severity and prognosis. 15 At the same time, pronounced nucleic acid shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was observed for 7 days in mild cases. 15 To better appreciate the links between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVID-19, it is important to understand the underlying pathobiology of coronavirus infection. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the transmembrane ACE2 protein (a homologue of ACE) to enter type II alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and other cell types 12 (Figure 2) . The process requires priming of viral S protein by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2. 12 Thus, infection with SARS-CoV-2 requires co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the same cell type, as proteolytic cleavage of viral S protein is essential for binding of the virus to ACE2. Exploitation of ACE2 by coronavirus is important in predicting potential pathology as ACE2 is particularly highly expressed in pericytes, in addition to type II alveolar epithelial cells, according to the single-cell human heart atlas. 16 High expression of ACE2 in pericytes could lead to development of microvascular dysfunction, 17 explaining greater propensity for acute coronary syndromes (ACS). 5 Moreover, ACE2 expression is up-regulated in failing human hearts, suggesting a plausible explanation for a higher infectivity of virus and a higher mortality in patients with heart failure. 18 Moreover, cellular entry of coronaviruses through ACE2 has implications for vascular instability and hypotension as well as increased mortality of infected patients who have pre-existing hypertension, albeit the latter association is confounded by the older age of patients with comorbidities. In addition to pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus, these findings also have therapeutic implications, as inhibition of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 and sera containing blocking antibodies against ACE2 have the potential to block viral entry and hence prevent or attenuate COVID-19 ( Figure 2) . In a murine model, TMPRSS2 inhibition blocked viral entry and attenuated the severity of coronavirus infection with improved survival. 19, 20 Two clinical trials have been started to test the efficacy of inhibition of TMPRSS2 by camostat mesilate for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (NCT04321096 and NCT04338906).",

Baseline demographics and pre-morbid status of study populations are expected to reflect the characteristics of individuals who were exposed to the disease early in the outbreak. In addition, availability and access to Upon the viral spike protein priming by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), SARS-CoV-2 uses the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter and infect the cell. Inhibiting TMPRSS2 activity (by camostat mesylate) could be used to prevent proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and protect the cell against virus-cell fusion (1). Another approach could be neutralizing the virus from entering cells and keeping it in solution by activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADMA17) which leads to shedding of the membrane-bound ACE2 and release of the soluble extracellular domain of ACE2 (2); with treatment with anti-ACE2 antibodies leading to blockage of the interaction between virus and receptors (3) or administration of soluble recombinant human ACE2 protein acting as a competitive interceptor for SARS-CoV-2 (4). Alternatively, purified polyclonal antibodies targeting/neutralizing the viral spike protein may offer some protection against SARS-CoV-2 (5). Interestingly, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), frequently used to treat hypertension, could alter ACE2 expression and intensify the SARS-CoV-2 infection. diagnostic testing as well as a high threshold for diagnostic testing or hospital treatment or suitability for ICU admission, because of finite resources, are expected to affect characteristics of the study populations and the clinical outcomes of the disease. For example, a large number of healthcare workers and inpatients were exposed to COVID-19 in the hospital in the early, rather than the later phase in the pandemic in China. 21 The demographics of patients in the early studies from China were different from those reported later in the largest aggregate study of COVID-19 patients by Guan et al. in China 22 (Table 1) . Data on cardiac involvement are unfortunately not extensively presented in the study of Guan et al. 22 The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (PRC) guidance 23 recommends the use of traditional Chinese medicine alongside what is considered more conventional interventions. The published reports do not provide details of the traditional treatment regimens in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, different choices of therapy were made and any positive/negative impacts of such interventions, which may have influenced outcomes, might have introduced additional bias.",

This finding has considerable implications in estimating the prevalence and preventing spread of the disease. Likewise, some reports show that up to 80% of infected individuals have mild symptoms and in theory represent a group that might not seek medical care-they might not, therefore, be tested or contribute to prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) estimates. Secondly, practically all countries experience shortage of the testing kits, therefore limiting the testing only to selected groups of individuals. Moreover, some deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 were not attributed to COVID-19, due to the lag time when severe complications tend to develop even up to 2-3 weeks following the initial infection. 8 ",

Fibrinous exudate and high hyaline membranes fill alveolar cavities. Polynuclear giant cells are prominent. There is marked proliferation of type II alveolar epithelial cells. Such severe manifestations appear only in a fraction of patients. A recent study of COVID-19 cases in China reported up to 28 January 2020 indicated that severe illness may occur in 16% of cases, 22 leading to an overall mortality rate estimated at 1.4% of the total reported cases 22 to 4.61% in the WHO reports (accessed on 28 March 2020). In some geographical regions, due to unexplained reasons, mortality may be higher (current estimates are 11.9% in Italy, 9.0% in Spain, and 7.9% in the UK according to the JHU Coronavirus Resource Center, accessed on 2 April, 2020 2 ). It is important to note, however, that great care must be taken when calculating fatality rates based on currently available data, as these can be overestimated in relation to insufficient testing in the community or underestimated, due to long lag-time between test positivity and death or the fact that there are large differences in attributing COVID-related mortality ('dying with' versus 'dying from' as well as differences in performing post-mortem testing). Limitations of healthcare systems, abruptly overwhelmed by a surge of patients needing mechanical invasive ventilation, have also been considered a potential source of the differences. Finally, these differences may result from population structure, as Italian patients have been older than the average age reported in the Chinese patients.",

Association with age seems to dominate this relationship 22 and may affect the actual importance of other factors reported in univariate analyses. Older patients (mean age 63 years old; range 53-71) are more likely to experience the composite endpoint of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death compared with younger patients (mean age 46 years old, range 35-57) 22 (Table 1) . Males seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19-related complications, representing between 50% and 82% of the hospitalized patients in the four publications that report these data ( Table 1 ) and the most recent report from Italy. 27 Table 1 summarizes key comorbidities identified by the major studies from China showing that the presence of pre-existing morbidities increases the severity of hospital-treated COVID- 19 . Notably, there is a large heterogeneity of reporting, with some studies comparing death with survival and others comparing ICU with non-ICU cases ( Table 1) . However, regardless of the approach, pre-existing CV conditions seem to be particularly important predictors of COVID-19 severity. 7 The investigators found that the fatality rate for patients with no comorbidities was 0.9%, whereas the CFR was much higher for patients with comorbidities. This included mortality of 10.5% for patients with CVD, 7.3% for those with diabetes, 6% for subjects with hypertension, 6 .3% for those with chronic respiratory disease, and 6.0% for those with cancer. [28] [29] [30] It was as high as 14 .8% for patients > _80 years of age. 7, 30 It is interesting that in Italian and Dutch cohorts, there are reports of higher severity in younger obese individuals as well. Severe cases accounted for 13 .8%, and critical cases accounted for 4.7% of all cases. Of significance, CVD occurrence affects the mortality rate to a larger extent than the presence of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which had not been the case in SARS. 7 These observations are confirmed by a recent meta-analysis, based largely on these studies and an additional 44 672 patient data set reported by the China CDC. 28 In this large cohort, CVD was reported in 4.2% of the total population and in 22 .7% of those who died. 28 By extension, it is expected that comorbidities are associated with higher rates of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19, but any effects that comorbidities may have on susceptibility to infection remain conjectural: accordingly, published frequencies of these comorbidities in China are included in Table 1 . Surprisingly, a history of smoking and of chronic pulmonary disease appear to be far less powerful determinants of severity in hospitalized patients than is the history of CVD. Curiously, the prevalence of smoking in hospitalized COVID-19 patients appears far lower than might be expected from assumed population prevalence and primary respiratory infection",

            "text": "was reported to increase the odds ratio (OR) for death by 3 .05 (95% CI 1.57-5.92 ) 32 in patients with COVID- 19 . These associations may, however, be largely confounded by the higher prevalence of hypertension in older people, as older individuals have significantly worse outcomes, more severe course of the disease, and a higher mortality rate than the younger patients. 22 Thus, in summary, while hypertension does appear to be associated with more severe disease, a higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and increased mortality in unadjusted analyses, there is no strong evidence to indicate increased susceptibility of patients with hypertension to COVID-19, when the association is adjusted for other risk factors. 33 The mechanisms of this possible relationship and their clinical relevance have been reviewed in a recent statement of the European Society of Hypertension. 33 The putative relationship between Figure 3 Key symptoms, and biochemical and radiological features of the clinical course of COVID- 19. hypertension and COVID-19 may relate to the role of ACE2. ACE2 is a key element in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is critically involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension. 34 Experimental studies demonstrated that inhibition of the RAAS with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may result in a compensatory increase in tissue levels of ACE2, 35 leading to suggestions that these drugs may be detrimental in patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2. 36 It is important, however, to emphasize that there is no clear evidence that ACEIs or ARBs lead to upregulation of ACE2 in human tissues. 36 Thus, currently there is no justification for stopping ACEIs or ARBs in patients at risk of COVID- 19 . 33 This has now been endorsed officially by many learned Societies, including the European Society of Hypertension, the International Society of Hypertension, and the European Society of Cardiology. 33 It also appears that in experimental models some RAAS blockers may exert a potentially protective influence. 37 Indeed, while angiotensin II promoted the internalization and intracellular degradation of ACE2, losartan reduced this effect, suggesting that ARBs may offer protection against viral entry into cells. 36 The recent integrative antiviral drug repurposing analysis implicated another ARB-irbesartan-as a potential repurposable medication for COVID- 19. 10 In fact, the known effect of ARBs on potassium metabolism may be seen as clinically advantageous in patients infected by COVID-19 given that hypokalaemia was reported as a fairly common manifestation of COVID-19 (possibly through increased kaliuresis rather than gastrointestinal loss). 38 Hypokalaemia in COVID-19 patients is difficult to manage, correlates with the severity of the disease, and has been suggested to be driven by activation of the RAAS. 38 ACEIs or ARBs might offer some protection in this setting. It also needs to be emphasized that hypokalaemia has not been reported in other studies. For example, in a patient characterization by Guan et al., 22 the median value of the potassium level reported was 3.8 mmol/L with the lower margin of the interquartile range (IQR) at 3.5 mmol/L. Nevertheless, antihypertensive medications known to increase serum levels of potassium (including carvedilol and eplerenone) were implicated as potential drug repurposing opportunities for patients with COVID-19 infection. 10 Moreover, observations from ICUs in Italy suggest that hypocalcaemia is a common metabolic abnormality in patients infected by COVID-19, that could be linked due to reduced albumin levels, which are commonly seen, and/or Ca 2\u00fe consumption through excessive activation of the coagulation cascade.",

Heart failure has been reported as an outcome in 23% of COVID subjects in a recent report from in-hospital Chinese subjects. Approximately 52% of non-survivors had heart failure as compared with 12% of survivors. 32 Evidence of myocardial injury, such as an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels (>28 pg/mL) was detected in 5 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in to enter the host cells including type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, pericytes, and cardiac myocytes, leading to inflammation and multiorgan failure. In particular, the infection of endothelial cells or pericytes could lead to severe microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction. Furthermore, in conjunction with the immune over-reactivity, it can potentially destabilize atherosclerotic plaques and explain the development of the acute coronary syndromes. Infection of the respiratory tract, particularly of type 2 pneumocytes, by SARS-CoV-2 is manifested by the progression of systemic inflammation and immune cell overactivation, leading to a 'cytokine storm', which results in an elevated level of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-7, IL-22, and CXCL10. Subsequently, it is possible that activated T cells and macrophages may infiltrate infected myocardium, resulting in the development of fulminant myocarditis and severe cardiac damage. This process could be further intensified by the cytokine storm. Similarly, the viral invasion could cause cardiac myocyte damage directly leading to myocardial dysfunction and contribute to the development of arrhythmia.",

All of these have been observed in COVID- 19. In the case of SARS and MERS, acute MI 59,60 has been reported in two out of the five deaths in early reports. 61 It is important to consider that type 2 MI is the most common subtype in viral conditions, thus the usefulness of invasive management with a view toward coronary revascularization (especially in type 2 MI) is limited. The decision for invasive vs. non-invasive management of patients with an ACS and COVID-19 illness should be carefully considered. Moreover, a recent single-cell atlas of the human heart indicated that pericytes express particularly high levels of ACE2 in the heart. 47 One of the implications of this finding is possible local microvascular inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection of the pericytes, leading to severe microvascular dysfunction, contributing to myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). This could explain recent reports of the clinical course of cases of MI during COVID- 19 .

Notably, experience from China indicates that a D-dimer increase is highly predictive of adverse outcomes in COVID- 19 . In a retrospective cohort study, elevated D-dimer levels (>1 g/L) were strongly associated with in-hospital mortality, and this relationship was maintained in multivariate analysis (OR 18.4 , 95% CI 2. 6-128.6 ; P = 0.003). 32 Moreover, Chinese and Italian experience emphasizes that more discrete changes in D-dimer levels are observed earlier in the course of disease preceding the rapid progression stage.",

            "text": "After the lungs, immune organs are the second most affected system by COVID- 19 . Pathological investigations in COVID-19 victims 23 have demonstrated splenic atrophy, with a very significant reduction in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as necrosis and haemorrhages. Similarly, lymphocytes are depleted in lymph nodes and the numbers of both CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe cells are decreased. 23 This corresponds to lymphopenia in peripheral blood observed in severe cases. Interestingly, an increase in systemic IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte colonystimulating factor, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) has been observed in subjects with COVID-19, 6 which corresponds to the characteristics of a cytokine release syndrome (CRS). 16, 68, 69 CRS development in COVID-19 is associated with COVID-19 severity. CRS has been characterized as a complication of immune targeted therapies in oncology, in particular in relation to severe chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced CRS. 70 It is also reminiscent of the cytokine profile noted in haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndromes. 71 Resemblance to the latter brought considerations that COVID-19 may be a cause of secondary HLH with cytopenias, significant haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, and low fibrinogen concentration. Clinical classifications have been introduced to aid recognition of secondary HHL. 71 Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses of COVID-19 active cases have also shown hyperactivated T lymphocytes with large fractions of HLA-DR\u00fe and CD38\u00fe CD8\u00fe/CD4\u00fe T cells and CCR6\u00fe Th17 CD4\u00fe cells. High concentrations of cytotoxic granules in cytotoxic T (CD8) cells have been observed. Thus, uncontrolled overactivation of T cells may account for, in part, the severe immune injury, 16 similarly to atherosclerosis and other CV conditions. 72, 73 These aspects should also be considered in the light of sexual dimorphism related to susceptibility to CV inflammation. [74] [75] [76] High serum IL-6 levels are a common feature in CRS patients. Indeed, in a recent retrospective multicentre analysis of 150 patients from Wuhan, circulating IL-6 levels were a clinical predictor of mortality in COVID- 19. 3 IL-6 is an important biomarker and possible target for CV morbidity and mortality linked to atherosclerosis. [77] [78] [79] This is important as therapeutic targeting of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) with tocilizumab is used in preventing and treating CRS caused by cancer therapies and HLH. 70 Tocilizumab is approved in >100 countries for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 80 Castleman's diseases, and giant cell or Takayasu arteritis. 81 Other IL-6Rtargeting agents, e.g. sarilumab, are similarly potentially of use. Therefore, its possible use in COVID-19 may be attractive to tackle CRS. However, when considering immunomodulation, one has to bear in mind that the primary problem is an infectious disease rather than the complications of cancer therapy. Therefore, its potentially utility must be carefully considered.",

In the USA, the 'Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Sarilumab in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19' (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04315298) has just started, aiming to recruit 400 patients, and will be shortly followed by the 'Tocilizumab to Prevent Clinical Decompensation in Hospitalized, Non-critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonitis (COVIDOSE)' (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04331795) trial, which is expected to start very soon. Finally, the most recently registered trial recruiting 330 patients: A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia (COVACTA) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04 320615) is being initiated. Similar trials have been registered in France, Belgium, and Denmark. It should be noted, however, that there are currently no published clinical trial data on IL-6 targeting safety or efficacy against the virus.

CRS-related cardiotoxicity has also been reported, mainly in the form of conduction abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, and elevation in BNP and cTnIs. 83 In COVID-19 patients, medium-to long-term CV consequences may be caused by increased IL-6 signalling. Experimental evidence supports an atherogenic role for IL-6 and CRS-related cytokines, 59,60,84-86 as well as its effects on cardiac fibrosis and failure. 87 The cytokine increases adhesion molecule expression in human endothelial cells in vitro; 88 at the same time, stimulation of human macrophages with oxidized LDLs (oxLDLs) leads to increased release of IL-6. 89 In experimental atherosclerosis, IL-6 mRNA is detectable in the aorta of hyperlipidaemic mice, 90 and administration of recombinant IL-6 increased plaque formation. 91 Similarly, reduced pathology has been observed in LDLr -/mice treated with a fusion protein of the IL-6 trans-signalling inhibitor soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp130). 92 Plasma IL-6 levels also have been associated with development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm, 93 and IL-6 has been shown to influence lipid homeostasis in mice. 94 IL-6 trans-signalling contributes to experimental cardiac fibrosis; 87 while the up-regulation of membrane-bound IL-6R causes vascular remodelling in pulmonary arterial hypertension. 95 Genetic variants leading to increased circulating levels of IL-6R and, therefore, reduced IL-6 cell signalling, have been shown to protect against coronary heart disease (CHD). 96, 97 Similarly, IL-6 trans-signalling is associated with increased CV risk. 77 ,98 IL-6 is routinely used as an inflammatory biomarker in CV disease. The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) trial demonstrated a stronger effect of IL-1b inhibition in reducing secondary CV events in patients with higher circulating levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicative of residual inflammatory risk. 98 Whether the observed cytokine storm and IL-6 increase in COVID-19 patients are transient or sustained remains unknown. Accordingly, monitoring inflammatory biomarkers in these patients in the medium to long term is of major importance. Similarly, CV risk should be closely evaluated during the acute phase response and in the following years.",

Both these novel coronaviruses are different from another recently emergent coronavirus, MERS virus, which crossed from the dromedary camel to humans and also caused acute respiratory failure, although utilizing a different cell entry mechanism via the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). 101 Overall, this highlights the potential divergence of respiratory coronavirus infections in humans, but emphasizes the close relationship between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, disease pathology was reduced in the presence of the ARB losartan. Intriguingly, in acute lung disease triggered by acid respiration or sepsis, ACE2 has also been shown to be directly protective, acting in partnership with the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT 2 R), and administration of recombinant ACE2 in this model is protective. 103 Taking together the evidence from multiple experimental studies, beneficial effects of ACEIs or ARBs and also ACE2 supplementation in various animal models of lung injury or SARS have been shown and supported the concept that loss of ACE2 expression promotes the disease in lung injury models (reviewed in Kreutz et al., 2020 25 ) . ACE2 is also directly regulated by cytokines. 104 Decreased ACE2 levels could be a direct consequence of viral infection and/or the subsequent inflammatory and immune responses that occur in the infected lung. Interestingly, ACE2 is also reported to be detectable in macrophages, 105 and its knockout in leucocytes promotes adipose inflammation, 106 highlighting a role for ACE2 in the inflammatory response. Patients suffering from SARS have overwhelming immune and inflammatory responses and high mortality rates from acute respiratory failure, and furthermore they are also associated cardiac sequelae. For example, SARS patients also suffer from systolic and diastolic dysfunction and arrythmias, leading to sudden death. 107, 108 In murine models, intranasal administration of human SARS-CoV results in ACE2-mediated infection of the myocardium. 109 These observations support a role for SARS-CoV in direct myocardial infection and a possible causative role in cardiac disease subsequent to respiratory infection. In the murine heart, ACE2 was also almost completely down-regulated at the protein level following infection. Moreover, in autopsied cardiac tissue from SARS patients with SARS-CoV-positive lung infection, viral RNA was detected in the heart, combined with decreased cardiac ACE2 protein levels and elevated cardiac macrophage infiltration. Downregulation of ACE2 without compensatory effects on ACE may lead to the RAAS being tipped towards the detrimental ACE-Ang II-AT 1 R axis and away from the protective ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis.",

Therefore, SARS-CoV infection-mediated down-regulation of ACE2, as a direct mechanistic consequence of viral infection and/or as a result of the subsequent inflammatory responses, may lead to an imbalance in RAAS signalling and consequent CV sequelae. The knowledge that systemic spread of SARS from primary lung infection to other CV tissues, including the heart, is also important. Given that ACE2 functions as a receptor for virus entry into the cell, down-regulation of ACE2 upon infectioin with SARS-CoV is expected to prevent further viral entry, serving as a negative regulatory mechanism.

Supportive treatment should be the mainstay of management coordinated by the relevant specialist-multidisciplinary team. The approaches have been provided by numerous scientific and clinical societies during the early stages of the European outbreak and are continuously being updated. This includes a concise but comprehensive guidelines of the Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Anestesia Analgesia Rianimazione e Terapia Intensiva. 114 When disease progresses to severe phenotype, supportive treatment includes use of oxygen therapy if SpO2 is <92% on room air, 23 as well as haemodynamic support. Early intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are essential in those with progressive symptoms and increasing oxygen requirement. High flow nasal cannulae and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may play a role in some patients, especially where resources for mechanical ventilation are likely to be stretched. A lung-protective ventilation strategy is recommended by the WHO. Conservative use of i.v. fluids aiming to maintain tissue perfusion but a negative fluid balance aids lung recovery. 23 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be required in severe cases as per standard indications but should be considered early (veno-venous mode and could be initiated prior to intubation).",

Similarly, broad-spectrum antibiotics/antifungal treatments and treatment of arrhythmias are needed. Finally, due to the growing evidence of DIC as a cause of organ injury, anticoagulation should be considered. 23 Approximately 75% of patients in the early Chinese cohort received antiviral therapy. 6, 32, 43, 115 The Italian recommendation is to commence treatment with antiviral therapy when COVID-19 is confirmed in patients with mild symptoms but not in a high mortality risk category or with moderate/severe signs of infection. Numerous antiviral therapies have been used to try and limit viral replication. These include protease inhibitors such as liponovir/ritonavir (used for the treatment of HIV). However, a recent rapid randomized non-placebo-controlled trial including 100 patients in each arm showed no difference in the outcome. 116 Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue and polymerase inhibitor that was previously used for the experimental treatment of Ebola in a large phase III study. 117 While it had an acceptable safety profile, the remdesivir (GS-5734) arm was halted due to a higher antiviral efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the trial. Finally chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been suggested as having antiviral activity against many RNA viruses including SARS and SARS-CoV-2, through an increase of the endosomal pH and interference with the glycosylation process. 118 However, it has never been shown conclusively to have an antiviral effect in vivo. In alphavirus infection, while demonstrating an antiviral effect in vitro, it was found not to be associated with clinical effects in a randomized clinical trial and may even be associated with prolonged viraemia in vivo. 119 While these observations cannot be directly translated to COVID-19, large phase III trials are underway with hydroxychloroquine, that will inform about the possible therapeutic value of this approach. This includes the recently initiated 'Hydroxychloroquine Chemo prophylaxis in Healthcare Personnel in Contact With COVID-19 Patients (PHYDRA Trial)' (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04318015).",

Methylprednisolone was used in combination with i.v. immunoglobulins in the treatment of subjects with fulminant myocarditis. 118 Immunomodulatory therapies used include monoclonal antibodies against IL-6R, discussed above. IFNb, registered for treatment of multiple sclerosis, enhances suppressor T cell activity, reducing proinflammatory cytokine production.

Finally, 27% of patients in the early Chinese cohort received i.v. immunoglobulins.

It should be noted that data for these side effects and toxicities come from patients that use these drugs chronically for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, rocilizumab), hepatitis (ribavarin, IFN-a), or HIV infection lopinivir/ritonivir). Thus, the effect of short-term use of these medications for patients without these underlying conditions is not clear. Remdesivir is an experimental drug used in the treatment of Ebola. 117 Thus, its CV effects and toxicities are unknown. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have recently received considerable attention and interest for the treatment and possible prophylaxis of COVID- 19. However , the data to date in support of these drugs are weak and cardiac toxicities are considerable. A systematic review of the literature performed on patients treated with these drugs, albeit for an extended period of time (median 7 years) and with a high cumulative dose, demonstrated conduction disorders as the main side effect (85%). 122 Other adverse cardiac events included ventricular hypertrophy (22%), hypokinesia (9.4%), heart failure (26.8%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (3.9%), and valvular dysfunction (7.1%). Cardiac function normalizes in a significant number of patients (44.9%) upon withdrawal of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, while others continue to show irreversible damage (12.9%) or death (30.8%). 122 Thus, careful consideration should be given to the use of these drugs, particularly without stronger data regarding their efficacy. Of note, tocilizumab treatment has been shown to influence lipid metabolism in RA patients. Following tocilizumab, total-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol were increased, while CV risk biomarkers such as HDL-SAA, secretory phospholipase A2 IIA, and lipoprotein(a) were significantly reduced. 123 Very recently, the ENTRACE clinical trial supported the CV safety of tocilizumab in RA patients; 124 however, to date, IL-6 targeting has not been tested for secondary prevention in CVD.",

The mechanisms through which CVDs worsen the prognosis in COVID-19 are unknown. It remains to be addressed to what extent individual CVDs are exacerbated by COVID- 19 . Do pre-existing hypertension and CVDs increase infection risk and/or worsen the course of disease progression? Is the severity of CVDs related to high expression levels of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in the heart and blood vessels? What influence, if any, do inhibitors of the RAAS have on susceptibility to COVID-19 and its clinical outcomes? What are the factors or therapies for CVDs that may confer protective effects against COVID-19 and its clinical outcomes? How does pre-existing CVD worsen cardiac involvement specifically? What transferable knowledge can be learned about this pathogen that would advance our understanding of CV risk for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other virus infections in the future? Finally, probably the most important question remains, what are the determinants of heterogeneous host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection? The answers will be found in integrated approaches by CV immunological ID and other expertise coming together. The use of systems based on hypothesis-free in silico methodologies will be essential. This pandemic is unlike any other in arriving at the same time as humankind being in possession of remarkable molecular data science and informatic tools. This is a major test of our ability to harness such capacity for the greater good.",
