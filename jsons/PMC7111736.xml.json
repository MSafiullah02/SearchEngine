The average incidence of BRD in the USA is calculated to be 20% of receiver calves but can be as high as 40% (Snowder et al., 2006). The primary cost is reported to be due to both the cost of treatment as well as a reduction in subsequent animal performance and carcase merit (Duff and Galyean, 2007, Gay and Barnouin, 2009). In addition to the direct cost of BRD, the increasing concern regarding the use of antibiotics and the potential impact on the promotion of resistant microbes is also apparent and is a growing focal point for global health organizations (World Health Organization (WHO), 2011) and the cattle industry generally (Jericho and Kozub, 2004, Watts and Sweeney, 2010). This concern has led to the development of antibiotic resistant monitoring systems (Wallmann, 2006) and concern regarding antibiotic resistance has had a significant influence on the national agricultural policy for Research and Development Programs (www.agr.gc.ca).",

Unfortunately, the clinical signs of BRD are often not apparent until late in the course of the disease due to the challenge associated with early diagnosis (Poulsen and McGuirk, 2009). Numerous diagnostic approaches have been attempted with varying success including the use of acute phase proteins (Humblet et al., 2004), PCR techniques (Asano et al., 2009, Fulton, 2009) and ELISA (Quinting et al., 2007), breath analysis (Burciaga-Robles et al., 2009), analysis of cough or respiratory sounds (Ferrari et al., 2010), assessment of feeding and other animal activity (Basarab et al., 1997, Hanzlicek et al., 2010), analysis of protein profiles (Mitchell et al., 2008), rumen bolus temperature recording (Rose-Dye et al., 2010, Timsit et al., 2010) and various immuno-histochemical techniques (Wallmann, 2006).",

Currently, the most accurate methods of diagnosis remain analytical techniques such as serum neutralisation, ELISA or PCR procedures. However, with cattle at risk of BRD the information available is often limited and does not include extensive and expensive serum neutralisation or PCD data. Furthermore, if the assessment of an animal\u2019s health necessitates the capture and restraint of that animal in order to collect a biological sample then the stress of the process itself will introduce bias.",

These findings are also consistent with those recently reported by Hovinen (2009) and Polat et al. (2010) for the determination of mastitis in dairy cattle. Many of the aforementioned technologies including clinical scores, haematology, acute phase proteins, cytokines, antibody response and core temperature monitoring are useful aids to the diagnosis of BRD particularly when its prevalence is high in a population and once the clinical signs of respiratory disease are present. Infrared thermography has been shown to demonstrably diagnose BRD at an earlier stage of the disease than other conventional technologies (Schaefer et al., 2007). However, the early detection of BRD, especially in animal populations where the prevalence of BRD and the virulence is low, is more challenging. More difficult still is the development of any technology that can non-invasively and automatically aid in the diagnoses of BRD. The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of infrared thermography to non-invasively identify animals with BRD in a population with a low prevalence of respiratory disease. The calves used in the present study were exposed to a lower level of stressors for that purpose. Furthermore, it was the objective of the current study to examine the feasibility of automating the collection of infrared thermography data. For infrared thermography to be considered as a practical and feasible analytical tool it is necessary that such a system be demonstrated to be compatible with current RFID tags, be automatable and be more user friendly than carrying a hand held camera around cattle pens.",

The calves were weaned and transported approximately 6 h to a commercial auction mart to simulate transport and handling conditions typical of calves received at feedlots in Canada (receiver calves). The animals were held overnight without feed or water and then returned to the Lacombe Research Centre beef research unit. This protocol simulated a commercial auction sale and exposure. Upon arrival at the Lacombe Research Centre the calves were offloaded, caught in a restraining chute, weighed, blood sampled via a jugular vein venus puncture, sampled for saliva using a cotton swab and placed into outdoor pens measuring approximately 60 \u00d7 60 m with one third of the pen having a roof cover. The calves were fed in a conventional bunk feeder a balanced cereal grain silage ration containing 10% cereal grain which met or exceeded National Research Council (NRC) Recommendations (NRC, 1984). The calves received straw bedding and free access to fresh water via an automatic system shown in Fig. 1\n. All management and operating procedures met or exceeded the Canadian Council of Animal Care Recommendations (1993) and Codes of Practice for Beef Cattle Guidelines (Agriculture Canada, 1991).

The scanning camera was interfaced to a control system such that the animal self-collected an infrared image every time it attended the water station. The automatic scanning system used is shown in Fig. 1 and schematically in Fig. 2\nand consisted of the following components: the system was built around a conventional two water bowl float design from Ritchie water systems (Ritchie Cattle Fountains. Conrad IA, USA). Panels were installed along the sides of the water bowls with a partition in the centre to position the calves when they accessed water. Extension panels were placed on each side of the water bowls to place the calf\u2019s head at the proper focal distance. This system allowed easy access for the calves from two directions. A panel on one side of the water bowls was modified to facilitate a window measuring approximately 30 cm square in order to view the calves while drinking. Two in-phase loop antennae, specifically designed to read over a defined space where the RFID tags would be located, were mounted on adjacent panels, above and slightly behind each water bowl. Each antenna pair was connected to an Allflex PNL-OEM-MODLE-3 control module (Allflex EID system. Allflex Canada Inc. St-Hyacinthe, P.Q.). Electromagnetic shielding was placed on the side of the panel exposed to the holding pen to prevent reading tags on calves that were not accessing water. The design of the antenna system provided the identification of the calf at the water station as well as the signal to the control system to rotate the camera if necessary and to initiate capturing images when the calf\u2019s head was visible through the viewing window in the panel. The camera/motor assembly, enclosed under a protective cover, was located medially between the two viewing windows at a distance that provided a field of view to cover most head positions of the drinking cattle. Rotation of the camera to view a particular window was performed by a geared-head motor, controlled by a set of software commands sent to the motor control circuitry. This design met the good laboratory practice requirements for correct thermography: a fixed focal length and angle with a still image which enabled accurate thermal data collection. Software running on a computer located in an instrumentation cabinet read the tag information from the RFID control module, initiated the camera positioning, acquired the infrared image, performed the thermal analysis of the image and stored the acquired information in a database. The cabinet also housed the power supplies and motor control circuitry used in the system. Instrument integration, and the hardware and software used in this thermal station was designed and developed at the Lacombe Research Centre.",

The 12 calves displaying intermediate values (a gold standard score of 2 out of 4) showed an average orbital IRT value of 34.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C which was not significantly different from the TN calves but was significantly lower than the TP peak values (P\n < 0.01). Of interest in the present study was the observation that nine of the calves developed BRD signs during the study period and for these animals it was possible to automatically and non-invasively follow the thermal radiated response up to the time of peak thermal response and BRD onset. These data showed that there was over a 1 \u00b0C elevation in temperature for the TP calves over this time.

            "text": "In terms of infrared thermography, infrared heat loss is a significant avenue for the dissipation of heat in an animal (Kleiber, 1975). The technology has been demonstrated to be effective in the non-invasive identification of transport and other environmental stressors that alter heat loss (Schaefer et al., 1988, Stewart et al., 2007), as well as pain and fear in cattle (Stewart et al., 2008, Stewart et al., 2009, Stewart et al., 2010). An earlier comprehensive review of this subject has been published by McCafferty (2007). Using the gold standards criteria in the current study the data suggest that infrared thermography as a biometric measurement also shows utility in identifying the onset of disease in cattle. This is again consistent with previous findings from our own laboratory (Schaefer et al., 2004, Schaefer et al., 2005, Schaefer et al., 2006, Schaefer et al., 2007, Schaefer et al., 2008, Schaefer et al., 2009, Schaefer et al., 2010, Stewart et al., 2005) and with findings from other laboratories (Polat et al., 2010, Hovinen, 2009, Rainwater-Lovett et al., 2009). Indeed, as demonstrated by the ROC curve calculations, the efficiency of the IRT methods in the current study was equal to or better than any of the other methods (93% efficiency with IRT peak values) and in populations with a higher prevalence of the disease has been demonstrated to be superior to other methods in the early identification of disease onset (Schaefer et al., 2007). In the current study the IRT maximum values and the mean ratio values appeared to show the greatest utility as single measures. Of interest, however, were the observations that the rate of change of an animal\u2019s thermal profile as BRD onset occurred and even the degree of variation associated with a given measure such as standard deviation did show promise as valuable indicators. Further evaluation of such parameters on larger data sets and in data sets with perhaps a greater degree of BRD prevalence is merited. In the current study, compared to the industry practice of using clinical signs during pen checking procedures, a lower rate of false negatives was seen. In addition, compared to other procedures using breath analysis (Burciaga-Robles et al., 2009), rumen temperature probes (Rose-Dye et al., 2010, Timsit et al., 2010) or any number of biochemical procedures such as PCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA or acute phase proteins (Decaro et al., 2008, Fulton, 2009, Quinting et al., 2007) the non-invasively collected infrared data is likely to be more cost effective, less labour intense and timely as a diagnostic procedure. Most calves diagnosed with BRD are likely to be treated with one of a few antibiotics regardless of the causative virus. Hence, it may make some practical sense to simply provide early diagnostic information to an animal manager earlier. If specific diagnosis is desired then it may still make sense to conduct a first screen with an automated system such as infrared thermography and subsequently test suspected animals with more precise procedures.",

These animals appeared to be neither TP nor TN. This situation may be a failure of the identification systems to accurately classify animals. Or, conversely, these intermediate animals may well be a population of cattle that are either successfully resisting or slowly succumbing to BRD. In either case, being able to identify such individuals may still be useful from the position of monitoring potential or suspected or emerging BRD cases.",

Mounting the infrared camera on a motor capable of rotating to two different scan windows as signalled from the RFID reader has enabled this system to be placed on two water bowls and hence the capacity to study more animals is significantly increased and can service pens of 100 plus animals. The system was designed to accommodate a second water/thermography station situated parallel to the first station with the camera located centrally between the two stations, hence doubling the animal handling capabilities of the system. Also, compared to other prototypes, the present system is automated and non-invasive by using a RFID reader and lap top computer for data storage. These adaptations are significant from an animal behavioural perspective since the calves can attend the water station voluntarily and without restriction or capture. Hence, both thermal radiated values from the orbital region, as well as watering frequency, are obtained non-invasively. As a result it can be argued that such data are more representative of the animal\u2019s normal or steady state values, compared to values collected during animal capture and restraint. Current operation procedures also enable the use of a cell phone communication system to download collected data wirelessly or via the internet. Hence, data and animal responses can be monitored remotely to make management and treatment decisions regarding the emergence of BRD.",
