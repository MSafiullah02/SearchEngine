The primary prevention strategy by HBV immunization is a milestone in reducing the incidence of HCC in children [3]. Secondary prevention by screening or surveillance in patients at a high risk of HCC is the strategy for reducing the associated mortality by providing interventions in the early stage of HCC [4, 5].",

For example, since angiotensin II stimulates neovascularization and could act as a growth factor for cancer, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) could conceivably reduce cancer risk [6, 7]. Results of the study done by Chiang et al. suggested ACEI/ARB use lowers cancer risk [8]. On the contrary, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests ARBs are associated with a modestly increased risk of new cancer diagnosis [9].Whether ACEIs or ARBs reduce cancer risk remains an issue to debate [7].",

Moreover, ACEIs or ARBs have been reported to reduce liver fibrosis in human studies [29, 30]. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these positive scientific findings can be used to extrapolate the efficacy of ACEIs or ARBs into clinical practice and translate this rationale into effective health intervention for high-risk populations [31]. The present study analyzed the comparative effectiveness of ACEIs and ARBs in the chemoprevention of HCC in high-risk cohorts.",

In addition, the risk did not significantly differ between patients exposed and not exposed to ACEIs or ARBs within 6 months after antiviral therapy. Second, after adjustment for comorbidities (including liver cirrhosis, DM, and hyperlipidemia) and time-dependent variables of medications (aspirin, metformin, and statins), ACEI and ARB use was not a significant predictor of primary HCC in the HBV cohort (aHR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.81\u20131.16) and in the HCV cohort (aHR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80\u20131.16).

Among all comorbidities, liver cirrhosis was the strongest risk factor (aHR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.74\u20133.32) in the HBV cohort, followed by DM (aHR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.18\u20131.81); however, the effect of liver cirrhosis in the HCV cohort (aHR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.23\u20132.50) was not this large. Because advanced cirrhosis is a relative contraindication for interferon therapy in patients with HCV [37], the use of interferon therapy as a patient selection criterion in this study may explain the significant but relatively low effect of liver cirrhosis on HCC development in the HCV cohort. Meanwhile, HBV patients with advanced liver cirrhosis or decompensation are candidates for HBV medication in the reimbursement program of Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance. Therefore, these patients were recruited in this study. Nonetheless, the comparative effect of ACEIs and ARBs in the study cohorts was marginal and insignificant.

Signaling pathways, such as the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ras, mammalian target of rapamycin, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met, Wingless, and angiogenesis, were, even if not entirely, involved in the complex and interactive system that formulates this hypervascular tumor entity [38]. The phenomenon of HCC heterogeneity not only exists in different tumors [39] but can also occur within a tumor [40]. The contemporary view of the involvement of the renin\u2013angiotensin system in cancer, particularly HCC, might involve EGFR transactivation by AT1R and angiotensin II-independent, antiangiogenic effects of angiotensinogen [6, 41].The microenvironment in hepatocarcinogenesis becomes more complex in cases of viral infection and involves the transactivation of transcription factors and stimulation of inflammatory responses, thus resulting in oxidative damage, fibrosis, and genetic mutations [42]. Renin\u2013angiotensin system signaling may have a potential role in hepatocarcinogenesis; however, the actual real-world comparative and competitive influences associated with other signaling pathways in HBV or HCV infection remain unknown. Limited human studies have reported the potential of ACEIs in reducing HCC recurrence after curative treatment [13\u201315]. Consistently, high gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in patients with HCC was associated with poor survival.",

These confirmations minimized the bias of uncertainty in our study. We could not identify NASH patients accurately by ICD-9 classification, which is also a risk factor for HCC [50]. Future studies using the 10th version of diagnosis coding, in which there is a specific code for NASH, will help resolve this limitation. The other limitation of this study is that it did not consider some dietary [51, 52] and lifestyle-modifying factors, such as smoking [53], which might be involved in hepatic carcinogenesis and patient survival. Direct-acting antiviral therapy, which may reduce HCC incidence after HCV eradication [54], was not accessible in our cohorts.
