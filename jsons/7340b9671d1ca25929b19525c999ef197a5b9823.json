It has been suggested that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) by patients with high blood pressure, diabetes or cardiovascular comorbidities increases the risk of COVID-19 because both of these drug class are known to upregulate ACE2 expression [2] . The elevated level of pulmonary ACE2 might facilitate viral entry into pneumocytes and thus pave the way for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, the main cause of death in COVID-19). Consequently, some experts have suggested that withdrawal of ACEIs/ARBs in these high-risk patients might reduce the likelihood of severe lung disease [3] .",

Might this depletion be instrumental in the genesis of lung damage? Indeed, it has been shown that the RAS system in the lung is involved in ARDS, with an increase in ACE1 levels in the patients' bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [7] . Moreover, there is an association between the D/D ACE1 genotype [associated with high levels of ACE and angiotensin (Ang) II] and the severity of ARDS , [8] . The interaction between AngII and its type 1 receptor leads to pulmonary inflammation and capillary leakage, both of which contribute to the initiation and/or the aggravation of ARDS. It is noteworthy that an elevated plasma concentration of AngII has been observed in H7N9 virus patients with ARDS with an unfavourable course, but not in those with a favourable course [5] . Besides its role in ARDS, the RAS has also been involved in other lung pathologies such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary hypertension or lung cancer. ACE polymorphism might contribute to the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary hypertension in Asian patients [9] , and high-altitude pulmonary oedema [10] .",

The time course of the effect of ARBs on ACE2 seems to be in line with its potential use in clinical trials. Indeed, in mice models of ARDS, losartan was injected just 30 min before the induction of ARDS, a sufficient time to protect against the development of ARDS [4, 13, 20] .

We acknowledge that the balance between ACE2 facilitated viral entry into pneumocytes and the beneficial effects of increasing the expression and the activities of ACE2 remain unexplored. Moreover, the clinical effects of this ACE2directed approach are complex and may depend on the ACE1/ ACE2 imbalance at the onset of ARDS. This imbalance depends on the ACE1 genotype (D/D versus D/I or I/I), the presence of other pathologies, the use of drugs influencing the RAS and/or the extent of ACE2 depletion by the virus. We therefore suggest that the plasma AngII concentration could be a potential biomarker of profound ACE2 depletion and thus may identify individual patients who could develop a critical form of COVID-19 and benefit from treatment with an ARB.",

Post-mortem histopathology of Chinese patients deceased from COVID-19 supports this hypothesis, with viral particles detected in glomerular and tubular cells by electronic microscopy or immunohistochemistry of viral proteins [22] . However, recent reports of kidney biopsies in nondeceased patients give different results. Indeed, Larsen et al. did not detect any viral particles by electron microscopy or immunohistochemistry in one woman with similar kidney lesions [23] . The role of ACE2 could also be more complex than expected in the pathophysiology of kidney lesions. Indeed, ACE2 deficiency exacerbates nephrin down-regulation and kidney inflammation in the ApoE-mutant mice while recombinant human ACE2 supplementation alleviates inflammation, renal dysfunction and glomerulus injury [24] . Thus, we cannot exclude that our strategy to increase ACE2 expression through ARBs could potentially decrease the risk of severe glomerular or tubular injury in COVID-19 patients.",

Depending on the AngII concentration results, the ARB treatment could be initiated in patients with high and continuously increasing plasma AngII concentrations. The use of AngII dosage to select people for whom the benefit of ARB will be maximal allows us to think that the risk of ARBs-induced acute kidney injury will be less with that approach as compared with a non-targeted approach with ARB treatment. The AngIIguided approach would allow balancing of the indication and the posology of treatment with ARBs.",
