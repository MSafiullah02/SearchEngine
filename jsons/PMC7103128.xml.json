            "text": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary vascular resistance that finally cause right ventricular failure and premature death (Chaouat et al., 2008). It has been generally accepted and acknowledged that alterations in the pulmonary vasculature, commonly marked by vascular proliferation/fibrosis, remodeling, and vessel occlusion, leads to most, if not all, forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Humbert et al., 2004). As a key factor blamed for the alterations in the pulmonary vasculature, cigarette smoking has been reported to result in muscularization of pulmonary vessels in the presence or absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Wright et al., 2003, Wright et al., 2004, Churg et al., 2006, Santos et al., 2002). Moreover, increased expression of vasoactive mediators (e.g., endothelin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor) have been detected in the guinea pig lungs after chronic smoke exposure and those mediators are reported to be associated with vascular remodeling and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (Wright et al., 2006). However, the precise mechanisms by which chronic cigarette smoke exposure produces PAH are still poorly understood.",

            "text": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in a number of studies. For instance, increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in pulmonary arteries has been reported in PAH patients (Orte et al., 2000). Increases in angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors were both demonstrated in hypoxic and monocrotaline-treated pulmonary hypertensive rats (Chassagne et al., 2000, Ferreira et al., 2009). In the RAS, ACE plays a central role in generating Ang II from angiotensin I (Ang I) (Turner & Hooper, 2002), and Ang II exerts a prominent role in the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH (Jeffery & Wanstall, 2001), particularly in promoting the growth of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) via AT1 receptors (Morrell et al., 1999). Moreover, medication with either ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist can attenuate pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH in chronic hypoxia or monocrotaline-treated rats (Nong et al., 1996, Kishi et al., 2006). Additionally, nicotine, an important component of cigarette smoke, and its metabolites can increase both the activity and the expression of ACE in cultured human endothelial cells (Saijonmaa et al., 2005, Ljungberg & Persson, 2008). Furthermore, inhibition of ACE may improve endothelial function in chronic cigarette smokers (Butler et al., 2001). Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that activated RAS might also contribute to the development of chronic smoking-induced PAH.",

            "text": "Losartan, a specific AT1 receptor blocker, exerts its influence on the RAS via inhibiting the stimulation of the AT1 receptor by Ang II. It has been reported that losartan treatment may attenuate pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in hypoxic rats and in piglets with left-to-right shunts (Chassagne et al., 2000, Rondelet et al., 2005). However, it has not been determined whether losartan has a therapeutic effect on chronic cigarette smoking-induced PAH. In addition, losartan has shown a modulatory effect on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in hypertensive and cardiovascular diseases (Ishiyama et al., 2004, Koka et al., 2008). ACE2, with a main role in cleaving Ang II into angiotensin (1\u20137) [Ang (1\u20137)] (Ferrario et al., 2005b), is a recently found regulator of the RAS and has been implicated in multiple lung diseases, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV) infection, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and monocrotaline-induced PAH (Imai et al., 2005, Kuba et al., 2005, Li et al., 2008, Ferreira et al., 2009). However, it has not been elucidated whether ACE2 has a role in chronic smoking-induced PAH. A recent study shows that the antihypertensive action of AT1 antagonists may be partially due to increased Ang II metabolism by ACE2 (Ferrario et al., 2005a). Thus, in the present study, we sought to investigate whether losartan is therapeutically useful in smoke-induced pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH and the possible participation of ACE2 in the mechanism.",

Losartan treatment markedly reduced the pulmonary artery remodeling and RVSP elevation caused by cigarette smoke exposure and partially reversed the smoke-induced ACE2 decrease and Ang II elevation in rat lung. Consistent with our in vivo study results, in PASMCs from smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats in an exposure time-dependent manner. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3-month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly by the ACE2 inhibition with DX600. In cultured PASMCs from control rats, in vitro CSE challenge could also stimulate cell proliferation and reduce ACE2 levels, which could be significantly inhibited by losartan pretreatment. Thus, our results suggest that losartan may have a therapeutic role in the smoking-induced pulmonary artery remodeling and PAH, in which ACE2 may serve as part of the mechanism.",

Since ACE plays a key role in converting Ang I into Ang II in the RAS, we hypothesized that cigarette smoke exposure may increase Ang II production in vivo by activating the RAS. In the present study, we found a significant elevation in ACE expression and an almost two-fold increase in Ang II levels in the lungs from the PAH rats exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months as compared to those from the control rats. Since Ang II is believed to play an important role in PAH via binding to AT1 receptors (Jeffery & Wanstall, 2001), our results suggest that activated RAS may also be involved in the smoke-induced pulmonary artery remodeling and PAH.",

Therapeutic effects of losartan on PAH in hypoxia rats and shunted piglets have been reported (Rondelet et al., 2005). Our study showed that losartan treatment effectively suppressed pulmonary artery medial wall thickening and RVSP elevation in smoke-exposed rats as well as the CSE-induced cell proliferation in rat PASMCs. The inhibitory effect of losartan may be due to its property of directly blocking the AT1 receptor, which, as we speculate, might result in the accumulation of Ang II via an undetermined mechanism. But interestingly, in the rats treated with smoke exposure plus losartan administration, we observed a significant decrease in Ang II levels in the lung as compared to the rats exposed to smoke alone, implying the existence of additional potential mechanisms for losartan-attenuated PAH in the smoke-induced rat model. In other words, losartan can not only inhibit the effect of Ang II but may also decrease Ang II levels in cigarette smoking-induced PAH.",

In the present study, we found a significant decrease in ACE2 levels in the cigarette smoke-induced PAH rats and in the cultured CSE-challenged rat PASMCs, which could be partially restored by losartan treatment. On the contrary, losartan had no effect on the smoke-induced ACE elevation. In a previous study, Ferrario et al. (2005a) also found that losartan treatment (10 mg/kg) showed no effect on plasma ACE activity in normotensive Lewis rats. Similarly, in another study in Wistar rats with experimental congestive heart failure (CHF), ACE activity in the myocardial homogenate did not differ between the treatment with and without eprosartan (another AT1 receptor antagonist) administration (Karram et al., 2005). Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that losartan can efficiently increase both the expression and activity of ACE2 in rat heart or human kidney (Koka et al., 2008, Xia et al., 2009). Increased ACE2 may augment the conversion of Ang II into Ang (1\u20137), leading to the decrease in Ang II concentration. Thus, these findings suggest that losartan treatment may have more influence on ACE2 than on ACE, and the reduction of Ang II in the attenuation of losartan-treated PAH is probably due to the losartan-induced elevation in ACE2 levels. As a result, the stimulation of the AT1 receptor in response to Ang II is reduced, which may also contribute to the attenuation of smoke-induced PAH by losartan treatment.",

It has been found that ACE2 plays a protective role but its expression is decreased in human and experimental pulmonary fibrosis (Li et al., 2008). In a very recent study, chronic treatment with XNT, a synthetic activator of ACE2, prevented the elevation of RVSP, right ventricular hypertrophy, and thickness of pulmonary vessel wall in monocrotaline-induced PAH rat model (Ferreira et al., 2009). In our present study, we found that ACE2 protein expression was significantly decreased in the lung along with apparent pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH in the 6-month smoke-exposed rats. Moreover, in our in vitro study, Western blotting results also showed that ACE2 was markedly decreased in the PASMCs from the smoke-exposed rats compared with those from the control rats. In addition, ACE2 inhibition with DX600 significantly increased PASMC proliferation rate above the level induced by smoke exposure alone, indicating a possible involvement of ACE2 in the smoke-induced growth of PASMCs. There is recent evidence that Ang II downregulates ACE2 via AT1 receptor-mediated ERK/p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway (Koka et al., 2008), therefore the decrease in ACE2 protein expression induced by chronic cigarette smoke exposure may be mediated by a mechanism dependent on Ang II and its receptors. The detailed mechanism itself warrants further study.",
