However, among children with seropositivity against CMV and seronegativity against EBV, there was a positive association with sensitization to food allergens.7 This led us to test the interaction of seropositivity against CMV and EBV in relation to IgE sensitization. This indicated effect modification such that the negative association of EBV seropositivity with sensitization was further enhanced in children who were also seropositive for CMV. The mechanism for this putative interaction is unknown. Several plausible explanations are possible, including the idea that IL-10 homologues present in the viruses might downregulate the antigen processing/presentation capacity of dendritic cells/macrophages and thereby switch off the host T-cell system, similar to the downregulation observed for T regulatory cells.22, 23 Alternately, both EBV and CMV can polyclonally activate B cells to produce antibodies with many different specificities and thereby hinder the capacity of allergens to cross-link the B-cell receptor as seen for helmintic infections.24 Thus, these data and our results provide further support for the hypothesis that specific characteristics of EBV and/or CMV infection, rather than infection per se, might influence the risk of IgE sensitization.",

Again, the characteristics of infection may be important, and identification through hospitalization suggests more severe acute infection than the majority of children in our study would have had. Blanco-Quiros et al26 reported that infants who developed severe RSV bronchiolitis had low levels of IL-12, a strong TH1 inducer, in cord blood.

Because we selected children with different family histories of allergy, we believe that the group of children in our study is fairly comparable with children in the general population. Furthermore, the exact sensitivity for seropositivity in some of the assays used to evaluate the respiratory infections is not fully known because they have been used mainly to detect ongoing infections, so the rate of seropositivity is somewhat underestimated, but this should not introduce bias. The optimal approach would have been to perform neutralization assays, but serum samples from infants are inevitably insufficient for tests using low serum dilutions. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity for seropositivity of the assays used for the herpesvirus infections have been proven reliable, as best demonstrated by the correlation between initial serostatus and clinical outcome found in transplant recipients.31 It could also be argued that analyzing 13 different viruses could produce some associations with IgE sensitization by chance.
