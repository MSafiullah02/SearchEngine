Do you perform the preoperative chest CT scan? Q4. Do you ask your patients to stay at home for two weeks before surgery? Q5. Does your hospital offer the same preoperative screening system in other departments as your department? Q6. Do you think RT-PCR testing is necessary as the preoperative screening test? (at Survey #2 only) the survey #1, nevertheless chest CT scan is not always 83 recommended as a preoperative test for COVID-19 in low-84 prevalence ( < 10%) countries [11 , 13] . screening system in other departments as your department?\" 94 In Japan, there was sufficient penetration in the department 95 of otolaryngology, but hospital-wide recognition of such pro-96 cedures is still inadequate. Leaving this situation untreated is 97 dangerous and will not only lead to the depletion of medical 98 resources, but may also lead to the withdrawal of medical 99 personnel and the collapse of medical care.
