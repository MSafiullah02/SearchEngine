            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute life-threatening inflammatory lung injury characterized by severe hypoxemia and stiff lungs due to diffuse alveolar injury and immune cell infiltration [1, 2]. Although vast improvements have been made in ARDS treatment in the past decade, the mortality rate of patients with severe ARDS remains unacceptable at 45% [1]. Therefore, early identification of patients at risk is crucial to allow them to benefit from timely treatment. The pathophysiologic causes underlying ARDS include endothelial barrier disruption, dysregulated cytokine secretion, and profound lung inflammatory response [3, 4], all of which are potentially regulated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).",

S1P is a potent barrier-enhancing agent and the major endothelial chemotactic factor present in the serum [8, 9]. Previous evidence has demonstrated that the circulating S1P level is significantly lower in the presence of sepsis [10] and acute dengue infection [11], in which inflammation and endothelial damage play causal roles. In an acute lung injury (ALI) model, S1P delivery reduced vascular leak and attenuated oxygenation impairment [12]. In animal models of infection-induced micro-vascular endothelial dysfunction, administration of S1P analogues stabilized the micro-vascular endothelium, reduced excessive cytokine production and improved the outcome [13, 14]. Considering these observations, S1P could be a critical factor for preserving the endothelial barrier integrity and eliciting immunomodulatory effects against the progression of ARDS.",

It is unknown whether differences in serum S1P levels among patients are associated with polymorphisms in the S1P gene. Therefore, we postulated that (1) serum S1P levels are substantially decreased in ARDS patients and could be a valuable predictor of disease severity, and (2) genetic differences in the S1P gene reflect the serum S1P levels.",

Considering that blood samples from patients and controls were handled in the same way and there is no age dependency and gender bias in the S1P levels, we believe that the differences in serum S1P levels between controls and patients were due to ARDS. Platelets, RBCs and endothelial cells have been proven to be the main sources of S1P [18\u201320]. Thrombocytopenia and anemia in ARDS patients are probably related to the low serum S1P levels in these patients. Endothelial damage and barrier disruption play critical roles in ARDS [3, 4], which may cause decreased S1P production. Serum S1P levels are also dependent on the level of S1P carrier proteins. In the blood, S1P is predominantly associated with HDL-associated apolipoprotein M (apo M) and to a lesser extent with albumin [21, 22]. In ARDS, both HDL and albumin levels are decreased. Taken together, decreased S1P production, loss of S1P sources and reduced carrier proteins all contribute to lower S1P levels in ARDS patients.",

S1P, recognized as a potent endothelial cell agonist and angiogenic factor, directly contributes to the maintenance of the integrity of the vascular endothelium [23, 24]. Intravenous application of S1P to lung-injured animals was found to attenuate lung vascular dysfunction and to increase the endothelial barrier integrity [12, 25]. Mice with decreased circulating S1P levels showed increased vascular permeability, lung edema formation and decreased survival after inflammatory challenge [26]. In addition to maintaining the endothelial integrity, S1P seems to directly modulate the immune response. S1P can prevent neutrophil chemotaxis and the transmigration of neutrophils across an endothelial cell monolayer [27]. In ALI animal models, administration of S1PR agonists inhibited early pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inhibited innate immune cell recruitment and attenuated inflammatory lung injury [14, 28\u201331].",

We are not suggesting the use of S1P as a sole marker in risk stratification or for making decisions about treatment futility. Rather, we want to emphasize the association of S1P levels with mortality owing to its potential utility in combination with other biomarkers and clinical predictors. In our study, S1P levels correlated with the number of non-pulmonary organ failures, but they were not associated with ARDS severity according to the Berlin classification. Partially due to the limited sample size, it is possible that the relationship between S1P and mortality is mediated by multiple organ failure rather than by the severity of lung injury, measured according to oxygenation impairment. There is therefore a need to increase the sample size of ARDS patients to verify these results in future investigations.",

            "text": "Our study also has limitations. First, the smaller sample size of patients may limit power to investigate the association between functional SNPs and S1P levels. All the subjects were from Chinese Han population. It is possible that ethnic and genetic differences may also influence the association between S1P polymorphism and serum S1P levels. Second, apoM was recently identified as the responsible binding protein of S1P in the blood [32]. We were not able to obtain information on apoM levels owing to limitations in our data. Third, because patients with trauma, drug overuse, and other less common risk factors for ARDS were not included, the present findings may not be generalizable. Considering the heterogeneity and various manifestations of ARDS, the study results should be examined in larger samples to evaluate our findings among specific subgroups.",

Analysis of S1P gene polymorphism revealed that A to G variation of rs3743631 and T to A variation of rs907045 in S1P gene increased the risk of ARDS, as validated by actual measurements of serum S1P levels. A potential therapeutic strategy that would involve increasing the serum S1P levels during illness may be desirable. Further studies with larger populations are needed before our findings can be generalized to all ARDS patients.",
