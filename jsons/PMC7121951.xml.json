The anesthesia circuit should be secured; however, it should not be anchored tightly to the patient or the operating room table since the otolaryngologist may move the head during the procedure which may result in inadvertent extubation or mainstem intubation. Also, decisions regarding the placement (e.g., nasal vs. oral, left-side vs. right-side), and the type (e.g., oral RAE, named after the inventors Ring, Adair & Elwyn, nasotracheal) of ETT are primarily dictated by patient considerations, the surgical procedure, and the otolaryngologist\u2019s preference.

In fact, the large occiput may result in excessive flexion of the neck that necessitates placement of a shoulder role to provide adequate visualization of the larynx. The tongue is large in comparison with the oral cavity making mask ventilation and laryngoscopy more difficult. The epiglottis is relatively long, omega shaped, floppy, and angled away from the axis of the trachea. This makes visualization of the glottic opening difficult with a curved laryngoscope blade placed in the vallecula. Therefore, visualization of the glottic opening is more easily achieved with a straight rather than curved laryngoscope blade. The infant larynx is more cephalad than the adult larynx, lying at the C3\u20134 level in contrast to the C4\u20135 level of the adult larynx. In preterm infants, the larynx is even more cephalad, at the C3 level. The more cephalad position of the larynx makes the straight laryngoscope blade more effective for visualizing the airway than a curved blade.",

Clinically, this can result in the ETT passing easily through the vocal cords but fitting tightly in the subglottic area. Since the cricoid cartilage forms a complete ring that is not expandable, a snug ETT can compress the tracheal mucosa [1], possibly leading to laryngeal edema, post-extubation stridor or even residual stenosis. Based on this, the traditional teaching is that uncuffed ETTs should be used in the pediatric patient until the age of 8\u201310 years. The appropriate sized tube is determined by age [2] (Table 20.2).\n",

Since the adult tracheal mucosal capillary pressure is considered to be 30 cm H2O, the leak should be less than 30 cm H2O but above the peak inflation pressure (PIP) generated during positive pressure ventilation. The leak is determined by listening over the patient\u2019s mouth while the PIP slowly rises by incremental closure of the adjustable pressure-limiting (APL) valve. The pressure at which a leak is first heard determines how snug the fit is. In some instances, the \u201cperfect\u201d sized uncuffed ETT cannot be found and either a \u201ctight\u201d fit must be tolerated or a large leak is compensated by the use of high fresh gas flows.",

Appropriate positioning of the ETT is crucial to avoid endobronchial intubation or, if using a cuffed ETT, to avoid herniation of the cuff through the vocal cords. Due to the short length of the trachea in infants, there is less room for error. As measured at the alveolar ridge, appropriate insertion distance is as follows: 10 cm for a newborn, 11 cm for a 1 year old, and 12 cm for 2 years old [10]. The formula 12  +  age/2 [11] or 13  +  age/2 [12] is used for children older than 2 years. Of course, auscultation for equal bilateral breath sounds should be the final determinant of appropriate ETT position. Flexion of the head displaces the ETT distally whereas head extension displaces the ETT proximally possibly resulting in accidental extubation [9, 13]. Placement of a tongue depressor in the mouth causes distal displacement of the ETT as well [13]. During otolaryngologic procedures, head extension commonly occurs, particularly during adenotonsillectomy, which may displace the ETT proximally. Placement of a mouth retractor may displace the ETT \u00addistally. Therefore, after positioning for adenotonsillectomy, position of the ETT should be reconfirmed.",

During periods of increased negative pressure in the thorax, the chest wall collapses to a greater degree than in the older child resulting in an increased work of breathing and decreased ventilation. This is even more evident when airway obstruction exists. Furthermore, the intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles are immature. There are two types of muscle fibers, Type I and Type II. Type I muscle fibers consist of slow-twitch, high-oxidative fibers and are important for sustained activity. Type II muscle fibers consist of fast-twitch, low-oxidative fibers, and are important for short bursts of increased \u00adactivity. The diaphragm in the infant is composed of 25% Type I muscle fibers in contrast to the adult that has 55% Type I muscle fibers. The infant\u2019s intercostal muscles are composed of 45% of Type I muscle fibers whereas in the adult there are 65% Type I muscle fibers. This places the infant at risk for respiratory fatigue when challenged with airway obstruction for a prolonged period of time. The adult composition of muscle fibers is achieved by 1 year of age [15]. For these reasons, decreased chest wall compliance and decreased presence of Type I muscle fibers, it is recommended that infants less than 12 months of age should be tracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated during general anesthesia except for possibly a short procedure lasting less than 1 h.",

Therefore, vagal stimulation, such as during laryngoscopy, and hypoxia will result in significant bradycardia that in turn will result in a decreased cardiac output. Also, succinylcholine has been described to cause bradycardia with the first dose. In the past, most pediatric patients arrived to the operating room significantly sedated. When these sedated patients were induced with halothane, the induction agent of choice before sevoflurane, significant bradycardia and hypotension occurred. For this reason, many anesthesiologists routinely administered anticholinergic premedication, either atropine or glycopyrrolate, prior to or during induction. This practice has changed over the last two decades [17, 18] because of the use of newer anesthetics that do not cause excessive secretions or bradycardia. In addition, although premedication is still used, the depth of sedation is much less than it was in the past and bradycardia is rarely seen on induction of general anesthesia. Even the premise that succinylcholine causes significant bradycardia with the first dose has been challenged [19]. Indications for anticholinergic premedication are listed in Table 20.6.\n",

Stimulation of the larynx, either by laryngoscopy or secretions, during \u201clight\u201d anesthesia may result in either partial or complete laryngospasm [24]. Both partial and complete laryngospasm share the same clinical signs of tracheal tug and paradoxical movement of the chest and abdomen. They are differentiated by the presence of a high-pitched inspiratory sound in partial laryngospasm versus the absence of respiratory sounds in complete laryngospasm [25]. If not treated expeditiously, rapid oxygen desaturation and bradycardia will ensue. Therefore, atropine and succinylcholine should always be available, in both intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) doses, when caring for these patients. Treatment of partial laryngospasm consists of removing the noxious stimulus (surgical stimulus, secretions), applying positive pressure to the airway with 100% oxygen, and deepening the anesthetic with either a volatile agent or propofol (0.5 mg/kg) [26]. If these maneuvers fail, succinylcholine, 1\u20132 mg/kg IV or 4 mg/kg IM, should be administered. Atropine, 20 mcg/kg IV/IM, should be administered if hypoxia and bradycardia occurs [27]. Complete laryngospasm rarely resolves with positive pressure alone and a jaw thrust maneuver should be applied [27]. Alternatively, pressure on the laryngospasm notch (Fig. 20.1) has been shown to cause relaxation of the vocal cords. The laryngospasm notch is located behind the ear in the area posterior to the ascending ramus of the mandible, anterior to the mastoid process, and caudad to the base of the skull. Pain caused by pressure in this area results in afferent input to the vocal cords causing them to relax [28, 29].\n",

The literature has shown that despite symptom resolution, the airways remain hyperreactive even 4\u20136 weeks after an URI [34, 35]. Due to the frequency with which pediatric patients have URIs, waiting such a long interval to proceed with surgery may not be feasible or practical. It is the authors\u2019 opinion that postponing surgery for 3\u20134 weeks is a reasonable option. If the anesthesiologist and otolaryngologist agree to proceed with surgery, the parents must be informed of the potential risks and benefits of proceeding with surgery. The parents must be active participants in the decision and the discussed plan documented in the medical record. Although a more in-depth discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter, a good review is available [36].",

This hypermetabolic syndrome is the result of a massive release of calcium in the muscle that causes sustained muscle contractures. The incidence of MH varies but what is clear is that there is a higher incidence of MH in the pediatric versus adult population [38]. However, the incidence of MH may be decreasing because of the decreased routine use of succinylcholine in the pediatric population secondary to reports of hyperkalemic arrest in patients with undiagnosed muscular disease [39]. Therefore, any anesthesiologist caring for the pediatric patient should be aware of the clinical manifestations of MH and know how to diagnose and treat it. Additionally, obtaining a prior history of MH, in the patient and family, should be part of every preoperative evaluation so that appropriate preparation can be made prior to the initiation of any anesthetic.

It is during this stage that laryngospasm is likely to occur, particularly if the patient is stimulated such as during IV placement.

Remifentanil infusion can provide adequate intubating conditions [56] and is easily reversed in case of significant respiratory depression. Propofol should be used with extreme caution in that it may cause cessation of spontaneous ventilation or potentiate respiratory depression when used in combination with opioids. Dexmedetomidine may be useful in this situation as well [57, 58]. Muscle relaxants should never be administered unless manual control of the airway is assured.

While the muscle tone diminishes cyclically during sleep, the pressure in the airway is generally above the critical closing pressure (CCP), which is needed to maintain airway patency.

This may become evident once the ETT is removed at the end of the procedure. Treatment is the same as for negative pressure pulmonary edema which consists of oxygen, diuretic administration, and, if need be, re-intubation to provide CPAP or positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).

It should be remembered that even in the patient with a full stomach, removal of a foreign body from the respiratory system precludes placement of an ETT and the airway will be unprotected until the otolaryngologist introduces the rigid bronchoscope. Suctioning of the stomach after induction but prior to inserting the bronchoscope may be helpful in decreasing the risk of gastric aspiration. Tracheal intubation is possible when esophageal foreign bodies are present. However, cricoid pressure during rapid sequence induction may be contraindicated if the foreign body is at the level of the cricopharyngus.

There is a theoretical concern that controlled ventilation and positive pressure may push the foreign object deeper into the small airways making retrieval more difficult or creating a greater obstruction through a \u201cball-valve\u201d effect. Conversely, spontaneous ventilation may prove inadequate to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation and increases the risk of unexpected movement or coughing causing airway trauma or rupture. Although both methods of ventilation are acceptable, studies have shown that the need for conversion from spontaneous to controlled ventilation occurs frequently [86, 103]. The reverse, conversion from controlled to spontaneous, has not been reported. The ultimate decision will be based on the preference of the anesthesiologist and otolaryngologist, the medical condition of the patient, and the nature of the foreign body aspiration.",

However, since ventilation may vary during the procedure, particularly if spontaneous, the depth of anesthesia may be inconsistent, requiring an IV agent as an adjunct to ensure an adequate depth of anesthesia. If an unsheathed optical forceps is used in place of a ventilating bronchoscope (which is occasionally a useful technique in very small airways), total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) will be necessary. This can be accomplished in a number of ways and no particular method has been shown to be superior compared to another. Commonly used agents are propofol and remifentanil.

The video feed commonly available with modern bronchoscopy equipment greatly facilitates this communication, allowing all members of the team to see exactly where the bronchoscope is in the airway at all times.

If a cuffed ETT is used, the cuff should be deflated to avoid being damaged during this part of the \u00adprocedure. When the otolaryngologist enters the trachea, a large leak will develop causing a loss of tidal volume possibly compromising oxygenation and ventilation. It is during this time that communication between the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist is of paramount importance. If oxygenation and ventilation become significantly compromised, it may be necessary for the otolaryngologist to stop and occlude the opening made in the trachea. This maneuver may be necessary multiple times until the tracheotomy tube is ready to be inserted. Non-absorbable Prolene or nylon stay sutures (4\u20130 in infants, 3\u20130 in older children) are placed on either side of the tracheal opening to stabilize the trachea for cannulation. Postoperatively and prior to establishment of the tracheal tract, these stay sutures may be life-saving in the event that the tracheotomy tube becomes dislodged and re-insertion of an airway device becomes necessary. The stay sutures should be clearly marked right or left so that pulling on the sutures in the proper direction results in opening of the tracheotomy site. Absorbable sutures are used to adapt the skin to the tracheotomy site, maturing the tract, making the surgical airway more stable and minimizing the possibility of passing a tube into a false passage.",

They can be found at any site in the upper aerodigestive tract, but they are most common, and most potentially dangerous, in the laryngotracheal complex. Presenting symptoms consist of stridor and hoarseness. Rapid growth of the papillomas results in progressive airway obstruction and some of these patients present emergently to the operating room. Because the papillomas cannot be eradicated surgically, these children frequently return to surgery for debulking at intervals, with the timing being dictated by the rapidity of papilloma regrowth. The goal of surgical resection is to maintain a safe airway without causing permanent damage to the larynx. Although there are some adjuvant medical treatments that might prevent spread of the virus or diminish the rate of recurrence, the primary management of RRP at this point remains surgical [107].",

Furthermore, even in skilled hands there is a potential for permanent scarring and residual vocal problems [108].

This device allows for precise, rapid excision of papilloma tissue around a small ETT with minimal injury to the surrounding structures of the larynx.

Surgical drapes are flammable, and are unnecessary for this procedure, so should not be used. The patient\u2019s head and neck should be shielded with saline soaked towels, as mentioned above. The laser should always be switched off or in stand-by mode when not in use by the surgeon. Airway fires are caused by the laser beam contacting flammable material in the airway such as polyvinyl chloride ETTs or cotton pledgets. Therefore, during laser surgery of the airway, a specialized ETT should be used that will not catch on fire if contacted by the laser beam. Red rubber tubes wrapped with reflective aluminum have been used in the past, but such a coating may easily fail. Furthermore, the aluminum wrap can be applied only up to the cuff leaving the area below the vocal cords vulnerable to fire. Commercially available laser-safe tubes that have metal exteriors are more commonly used. However, their use in small infants or patients with narrowed airways is limited because of the larger outer diameter of laser-safe tubes when compared with the same sized PVC tube. The larger sized tubes come with two cuffs so that if the laser beam damages the proximal cuff, the second cuff will remain inflated and protect the airway. The cuffs should be filled with a normal saline solution not air. In this way, if the laser beam ruptures the proximal cuff, the spray of saline solution may extinguish early combustion, thereby, preventing an airway fire [111]. In some cases, the ETT can be dispensed with altogether during RRP excision by relying on apneic technique with intermittent intubation between brief laser sessions. This is challenging, however, for both the otolaryngologist and the anesthesiologist, and should not be the method of choice since better alternatives exist.",

This may be due to postoperative mucosal changes, or simply the fact that tracheotomy is done in patients with the most aggressive disease.

The ventilating bronchoscope would be more appropriate in this situation, allowing the optical element at the tip to be manipulated precisely past the supraglottic pathology to the (presumably normal) glottis and tracheobronchial tree. Once the airway has been secured in this manner and ventilation confirmed, tracheotomy may be done over the bronchoscope. Attempts at replacing the bronchoscope with an endotracheal tube using the Seldinger technique would inappropriately risk loss of the airway and exacerbating the existing airway compromise. However, it is important that good positioning of the scope be maintained throughout the tracheotomy, in the center of the lumen and above the carina. This would be the responsibility of a second endoscopist. Unlike an endotracheal tube, which may be safely secured by tape once proper placement is ensured, a rigid steel bronchoscope can potentially cause life-threatening trauma to the tracheobronchial tree if it is displaced distally or driven against the tracheal wall while being used to ventilate the patient.",

However, due to the acute inflammation in the subglottis, such patients are particularly prone to injury from the ETT [119]. It is best to avoid the need for intubation in the first place if possible (through the use of steroids, racemic epinephrine or heliox). If intubation is required, the smallest tube which will allow for adequate ventilation should be used, and extubation should be done as soon as clinically feasible. Since in cases of croup, visualization of the glottis is not typically a problem, consideration should be given to nasotracheal intubation. By fixing the endotracheal tube at the nares instead of the oral commissure, motion of the ETT (with associated axial shearing trauma of the subglottic mucosa) may be minimized, reducing the risk of airway injury. Tracheotomy through an inflamed tracheal airway (i.e., croup) is also associated with an increased risk for long-term complications such as stenosis, and should be used sparingly if at all. This was recognized as early as the nineteenth century [120].",
