Even though the EMA provided scientific advice for national regulatory agencies and manufacturers [3] , many countries in Europe launched different regulatory approaches and protocols for accessing potential medicines [4] [5] [6] [7] . Moreover, the dosing regimen in the protocols even for off-label use is not the same between countries, not to mention other programs. Under ideal conditions, the off-label program would constitute in the creation of a target patient population, informed consent and track and follow-up reports [8, 9] . Still, prescribing an already approved medicine either for an indication, a dose or a way that is not approved for COVID-19 seems to be very challenging for clinicians. Therefore, under the COVID-19 emergency conditions, it is hard to believe that the off-label use would result to be the best approach for accessing potential medicines, considering the ongoing regulatory debates and the difficulties in assessing riskbenefit for each patient due to the pressurized and stressful situation [8, 9] .",

Although terminology and modalities may not be identical, compassionate use programs demanding regulatory approval, informed consent and follow-up information are established in most countries [11, 12] , and can be used to facilitate the access of seriously ill COVID-19 patients that cannot have access in clinical studies. Even though the compassionate use program is outlined within the framework of clinical practice, and does not have a control group, it can determine preliminarily safety and efficacy data until a level, within a well-formulated study design and hypothesis. Moreover, compassionate use might be seen as a treatment option for small countries which rarely have access to international clinical studies. In the past, during the interval of 5 years (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) , the unapproved Ganciclovir was prescribed under the compassionate use for treatment of pneumonia Cytomegalovirus (CMV), retinitis CMV and colitis CMV for seriously ill immune-compromised patients and even today after 30 years it remains the preferred therapy for the treatment of CMV [13] .",

            "text": "On the other hand, the idea for approving the emergency use relies not just in the emergency circumstances but also in providing legal protection for healthcare professionals and manufacturers for eventual adverse events and medication errors that the potential medicine may cause, as well as prescribing and dispensing a donated medicine free of charge within the framework of the hospital, and not obtaining informed consent for patients while tracking and reporting the treatment's outcomes [14, 15] . Having regard to the fact that the manufacturer Gilead was called from the licensed clinicians to provide Remdesivir to hospitalized COVID-19 patients under the compassionate use, since 25th January 2020, and based on the methodological issues found at Grein et al.'s paper [16] , it remains doubtful whether Gilead or regulatory authorities were not vulnerable toward this program. Even though the regulatory authorities usually approve most of the compassionate use requests when meeting the criteria, the key player in this program is the manufacturer, who is not legally obliged to provide the medicine to patients and is usually reluctant due to several factors (1) the outcomes of the compassionate program are not considered as an evidence for approval; (2) they may have limited quantities of the potential medicine already involved in clinical trials; (3) they may think they will be prejudiced if the medicine is proven to be ineffective and unsafe; (4) they want to bypass the regulatory requirements to provide followup information; (5) and the reimbursements issues in some countries [17] [18] [19] . According to regulatory authorities, the golden criterion for accessing and investigating potential medicines are clinical trials. The speed and volume of various clinical trials like Discovery, Recovery, Anger, Solidarity, New York Trial, characterized with different study designs, experimental arms, outcome measures, eligibility criteria and hypothesis emphasize the urge to produce significant safety and efficacy data in the middle of this pandemic crisis [20, 21] . The golden criterion for the elucidation of the safety and efficacy profile of the potential therapies in COVID-19 does not rely just on the pursuit of randomized clinical studies under an ideal sample size and power, but one should analyze carefully and considerate the other aspects of the study design (e.g. study duration and masking), eligibility criteria (enrolling participants with similar characteristics) and clinically meaningful endpoints. This table used unified regulatory characteristics of the EU and the US. Instead of \"yes\" we used the\" tick symbol\". Also, when a unified criteria was not met we used the not applicable (N/A) choice",

            "text": "Having regard to the diverse clinical presentation, course and progression of COVID-19 and the limited medical supply, regulatory authorities should establish robust regulatory programs that minimize clinical dilemmas in choosing the best therapy for COVID-19 patients. While clinicians should continue to inform COVID-19 patients or their legal representatives for the potential outcomes of therapies, obtaining informed consent from them is crucial for facilitating the clinical decision. Based on the available data, we believe that in COVID-19, no golden criterion is met in clinical research, not to mention clinical practice. Therefore, compassionate use program's mechanism with no control group might be shifted from \"outside of clinical studies\" to \"parallel with clinical studies\" to permit clinical studies to be implemented within their rigorous and narrow framework. However, how safe, effective and correct these current regulatory approaches have been, remains to be verified in the future. ",
