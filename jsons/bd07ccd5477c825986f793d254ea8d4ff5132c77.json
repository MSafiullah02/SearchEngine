To date, more than 80000 people have been infected, and more than 3000 have died. In addition, COVID-19 has already spread to 142 countries, such as Korea, Iran, and Italy.

Professional visualization methods for high-dimensional data, e.g., parallel coordinate plots and calendar based approaches [2] , are not intuitive for the inexperienced. Basic statistical charts and visualization methods with up to four visual channels are preferable, and the need for user interaction should be avoided. Therefore, we define spread index and extinction index that explicitly reveal the pandemic situation from the raw data, which will be introduced later. Beyond that, the system must also cope with high dynamic range data varying over four orders of magnitude. Spread index and extinction index. Here, we define several quantities related to the pandemic data. In the early part of the spread of an pandemic, a model [1] of the number of people infected I(t) follows exponential growth. We express the model as I(t) = ba t in a local domain, and then derive the spread index F s = I \u2032 /I = ln(a) which expresses the spreading speed of the pandemic. Here, I S (i) denotes the total number of confirmed cases, I t (i) denotes the number of confirmed cases under treatment, I(i) denotes the number of new confirmed cases, and C(i) and D(i) denote the increases in the number of people cured and the fatalities on day i, respectively. The spread index F s (i) can be computed easily as F s (i) = I(i)/I t (i \u2212 1). We can also investigate when the pandemic declines, which occurs when the daily increase in confirmed cases becomes less than the number of people cured and the number of fatalities. There, we can define the extinction index F e (i) for day i as F e (i) = (C(i) + D(i))/I t (i \u2212 1). Figure 1(b) shows the spread and extinction indexes.",

As mentioned previously, the distribution of COVID-19 is extremely unbalanced, with 83% of infections in China being in Hubei Province, and Wuhan city itself accounting for 60% of all infections in China by February 23. Note that ThemeRiver [5] cannot handle such data well, thus, we have redesigned ThemeRiver by plotting Hubei and all other provinces in opposite directions along a horizon line. Here, the horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents the number of new confirmed patients. In the process, the stacking order is important for ThemeRiver. From the definition of I s (i), we derive I s (i) = i j=1 I(j). Thus, the area of each branch in the ThemeRiver is the total number of confirmed cases I s (i). The curve on the bottom of each branch k is the sum of the heights of branches above it, and its own height. Here, let I k (i) denote the number of new confirmed patients for the kth branch in the ThemeRiver stacking order. Thus, the curve position P k (i) of each branch k on day i of ThemeRiver can be computed as P k (i) = P k\u22121 (i)+I k (i) = an interaction-less animation, we sort all branches in descending order by their total number of confirmed cases; thus, users can focus on the current situation and readily observe changes in the most severely affected provinces.",

Figures 1(e) and (f) show bubble charts of the situation for all cities in Hubei Province and all provinces in China respectively. To facilitate analysis of the situation and find rules and abnormal cases, additional factors are calculated based on the raw situational data and combined into visualizations. The infection rate F r (i) is a very important factor for pandemic spread. It is defined as F r (i) = I s (i)/P , where P is the resident population of an area. We can also define the cured rate as F c (i) = Case study. Using this system, several important developments are identified. These cases demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system.",
