Recent studies have shown that aquatic plants possess potential to remove pathogens from wastewater. High removal (90%) of pathogenic microbes such as Enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella have been achieved using aquatic plants viz. Typha latifolia, Cyperus papyrus, Phragmites mauritianus, Pistia stratiotes, Lemna paucicostata, Spirodela polyrhiza, and Eichhornia crassipes. Pathogen removal by aquatic plants mainly occurs by attachment of pathogens to plant roots followed by filtration or toxicity exerted by exudates produced by them. Effective control of pathogens in constructed wetlands has been achieved because of various physical, chemical, and biological processes operating in them. Constructed wetlands with aquatic plants have shown high efficacy in treating pathogencontaminated water. The exact mechanism of pathogen removal by these plants needs to be evaluated so that their role in phytoremediation technologies can be emphasized.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Water contamination has increased tremendously throughout the globe. The presence of pathogenic organisms has significantly increased in the municipal and domestic wastewater in last few decades (Pandey et al., 2014; Ram\u00edrez-Castillo et al., 2015) . Pathogens are the microscopic biological organisms capable of causing diseases. These mainly include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, helminths, and worms (Olaolu et al., 2014) . The harmful effects from pathogens range from mild illness to chronic severe sickness. Waterborne pathogens cause diseases that prove fatal and result in million of deaths annually (Awuah et al., 2001; WHO, 2012) . According to an estimate, diseases caused by waterborne pathogens cause about 1.4 million deaths in children every year (Pandey et al., 2014) . About 1407 species of pathogens infecting humans have been reported worldwide (Ashbolt, 2004; Jin et al., 2018) . These mainly include 538 species of bacteria, 208 types of viruses, 57 species of parasitic protozoa, and several fungi and helminth species (Table 17 .1). Some of the pathogens commonly found in wastewater include strains of Shigella, Salmonella, Leptospira, E. coli, Mycobacterium, Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, protozoa Giardia, Cryptosporidium, cysts of Entamoeba histolytica, etc. (Cabral, 2010; Makvana and Sharma, 2013) . Intake/ingestion of contaminated water leads to waterborne infection in humans. The pathogenic microbes infect the gastrointestinal tract and cause diseases such as cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid fever, diarrhea, giardiasis, infectious hepatitis, and amebic/bacillary dysenteries. The severity of the pathogen infection depends on the dose and the susceptibility of the host (Ram\u00edrez-Castillo et al., 2015) . Most of the pathogens live for short period of time outside the human body. Transfer of resilient bacterial cysts, oocysts, and direct pathogen through contaminated water causes infection in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 216, "text": "(Pandey et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 217, "end": 247, "text": "Ram\u00edrez-Castillo et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 408, "end": 429, "text": "(Olaolu et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 613, "end": 633, "text": "(Awuah et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 634, "end": 644, "text": "WHO, 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 767, "end": 788, "text": "(Pandey et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 869, "end": 884, "text": "(Ashbolt, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 885, "end": 902, "text": "Jin et al., 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1312, "text": "(Cabral, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1338, "text": "Makvana and Sharma, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1746, "text": "(Ram\u00edrez-Castillo et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1046, "end": 1055, "text": "(Table 17", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Realizing the health risk caused by consumption of water contaminated with pathogens, various technologies for treatment of wastewater have been developed.

Wetlands act as biofilters. They remove pathogens such as bacteria, virus, protozoa, and helminths via a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes taking place in the wetland (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; Decamp and Warren, 2000; Werker et al., 2002; Kuschk et al., 2012; Jasper et al., 2013) . The removal of pathogens in wetlands occurs because of filtration by plant roots, attachment to plant roots, plant microbe interaction within biofilms, adsorption to the soil/media/organic matter, sedimentation, and predation by microorganisms (Jim\u00e9nez, 2007; Alufasi et al., 2017) . Other mechanisms involved in removal of pathogens include (1) exposure of pathogens to biocides excreted by macrophyte roots, (2) natural die-off, (3) predation by nematodes, protozoa, and rotifers, and (4) oxidation and exposure to UV radiation (Kadlec and Wallace, 2008). The root zone (or rhizosphere) has been considered as active zone of constructed wetlands because of the presence of macrophytes growing there. Various physical, chemical, and biological processes take place in this zone. These processes are induced by the interaction of plants, microorganisms, the soil, and pollutants. This is referred as root zone technology (Preetha and Senthil, 2009; Makvana and Sharma, 2013) . Biofilms present in the plant roots are believed to supply a more effective substrate for removal of bacteria through various methods such as mechanical filtration, sedimentation, adsorption, die-off, predation, and antibiotic excretion (Soto et al., 1999; Karathanasis et al., 2003) Removal (83%e94%) of pathogen especially coliform and enteric bacteria by surface flow constructed wetlands has been reported earlier (Perkins and Hunter, 2000) . Studies have indicated that beds and stand of reeds reduce pathogens such as Salmonella, Enterococci, and E. coli by mechanisms such as predation by protozoa and exposure to antibiotic excretions from the roots of plants (Perkins and Hunter, 2000; Healy and Cawley, 2002; Nielsen, 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 393, "end": 415, "text": "(Headley et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 416, "end": 439, "text": "Calheiros et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 440, "end": 459, "text": "Ahmed et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 460, "end": 474, "text": "Vymazal, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 475, "end": 495, "text": "Gruyer et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 496, "end": 530, "text": "Zurita and Carre\u00f3n-\u00c1 lvarez, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 531, "end": 550, "text": "Zhang et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 551, "end": 570, "text": "Maiga et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 571, "end": 593, "text": "Almuktar et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 804, "end": 824, "text": "(Hench et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 969, "end": 992, "text": "(Gersberg et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 993, "end": 1015, "text": "Gopal and Ghosh, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1034, "text": "Meng et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1064, "text": "Alexandros and Akratos, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1253, "text": "(Stefanakis and Akratos, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1275, "text": "Donde and Xiao, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1444, "text": "(Al-Gheethi et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1639, "text": "(Smith et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1660, "text": "\u00c1 vila et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1681, "text": "Garc\u00eda et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1701, "text": "Mar\u00edn et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1845, "text": "(\u00c1 vila et al., 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2224, "text": "(Makvana and Sharma, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2445, "text": "(Kadlec and Knight, 1996;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2446, "end": 2470, "text": "Decamp and Warren, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2491, "text": "Werker et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 2492, "end": 2512, "text": "Kuschk et al., 2012;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2533, "text": "Jasper et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2780, "end": 2795, "text": "(Jim\u00e9nez, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2796, "end": 2817, "text": "Alufasi et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3457, "end": 3484, "text": "(Preetha and Senthil, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 3485, "end": 3510, "text": "Makvana and Sharma, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3750, "end": 3769, "text": "(Soto et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 3770, "end": 3796, "text": "Karathanasis et al., 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3931, "end": 3957, "text": "(Perkins and Hunter, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 4181, "end": 4207, "text": "(Perkins and Hunter, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 4208, "end": 4231, "text": "Healy and Cawley, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 4232, "end": 4246, "text": "Nielsen, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of wetlands in treating pathogen-contaminated wastewater"}, {"text": "The presence/absence of plants also affects pathogen removal in wetlands (Arias et al., 2003; Vymazal, 2005) .

Vymazal (2005) demonstrated that free water surface flow constructed wetlands that contained emergent vegetation effectively removed 95%e99% of E. coli and 80%e95% of fecal Streptococci. This is because planted systems enhance the presence of oxygen in the root zone and plants produce excretions that exert antimicrobial properties (Neori et al., 2000) . Greater reduction of thermotolerant coliforms, Enterococci, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and coliphage populations has been reported in subsurface wetlands containing aquatic vegetation (Hench et al., 2003) . Hill and Sobsey (2001) reported high removal of Salmonella from a horizontal subsurface flow wetland containing aquatic plants. In contrast, some studies reported no significant difference in the removal efficiency of pathogens such as thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli, somatic coliphages, and F-specific bacteriophages from planted and unplanted vertical flow constructed subsurface wetlands (Torrens et al., 2009; Lana et al., 2013) . E. coli removal efficiency of 2.8 log units has been noted in planted CWs in southeastern Brazil as compared to 2.3 log units in unplanted CWs (Avelar et al., 2014) . This is because CWs having plants show pathogen removal by several mechanisms (Weerakoon et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 183, "text": "(Arias et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 184, "end": 203, "text": "Mburu et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 204, "end": 225, "text": "Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 556, "end": 579, "text": "Silverman et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 719, "end": 736, "text": "(Wu et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1032, "text": "(Stott et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1053, "text": "Falabi et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1074, "text": "Redder et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1239, "text": "(Kim et al., 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1260, "text": "Barros et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1282, "text": "Reinoso et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1451, "text": "(Mustafa, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1694, "text": "(Mustafa, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1732, "text": "Almuktar et al.

The hydraulic characteristics such as HRT and hydraulic loading rate influence the removal of pathogens to a great extent (Garcia et al., 2003; Stottmeister et al., 2003; Vymazal, 2005) .

In most of the studies, a significant removal of pathogens has been noted after retention time of 4 days. High removal of parasites has been achieved in wetlands with long retention time (Sharafi et al., 2012) . This is because longer HRT increases the rate of pathogen inactivation because of increased exposure to sunlight, availability of more time for sedimentation, adsorption to organic matter, predation, and exposure to toxins from plants (Garcia et al., 2003; Stottmeister et al., 2003; Ulrich et al., 2005; Diaz et al., 2010) . Sunlight causes inactivation of virus and bacteria (Kadir and Nelson, 2014) . Studies confirmed that hydraulic overloading reduces the removal efficiency of thermotolerant coliforms because of decreased ability to adsorb to the biofilm (Wu et al., 2016) . Hence pathogen removal by wetlands occurs via physical, chemical, and biological processes. The physical processes include attachment, adsorption, sedimentation, and mechanical filtration by roots (Jasper et al., 2013) . The chemical processes involved in pathogen removal are oxidation and exposure to UV radiation, sunlight (photooxidation), high temperature, pH, and exposure to biocides. The biological processes involved in removal of pathogens mainly include plant microbe interaction within root biofilms, root-substrate complex, and adsorption (Morsy et al., 2007; Sleytr et al., 2007; Alufasi et al., 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 258, "text": "(Sharafi et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 496, "end": 517, "text": "(Garcia et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 518, "end": 544, "text": "Stottmeister et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 545, "end": 565, "text": "Ulrich et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 566, "end": 584, "text": "Diaz et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 638, "end": 662, "text": "(Kadir and Nelson, 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 823, "end": 840, "text": "(Wu et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1061, "text": "(Jasper et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1415, "text": "(Morsy et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1436, "text": "Sleytr et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1458, "text": "Alufasi et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogen"}, {"text": "Aquatic plants have shown tremendous potential to remove pathogens from wastewater.
