Similarly, viral conjunctivitis may easily extend into the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct mucosa in the direction of tear drainage. A higher frequency of histories of infectious (viral or bacterial) conjunctivitis in cases with PANDO was previously reported.13 The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of respiratory and ocular viruses in the PANDO pathogenesis.",

RSV is a segmental, negatively polarized RNA virus.15 It has the capability of affecting the cytokine production profile of adaptive immune system cells by shifting the T helper (Th) 1 / Th 2 balance toward Th 2 cytokines and immunoglobulin E.16 It has also been shown to alter the biological activity of macrophages.17 Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), a profibrotic enzyme has been shown to increase in the epithelium after an RSV infection.18 When all these mechanisms are considered together, RSV has the capability to trigger inflammation and fibrosis development by both shifting the Th balance toward the production of the profibrotic cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, and increasing the synthesis of connective tissue enzymes, such as MMP-9.18,19",

In addition, the nasolacrimal duct is surrounded by a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which is believed to provide immunomodulation, and damage to this structure has been associated with the development of PANDO.24,25 Because adenoviruses have been proven to cause latent infections in lymphoid tissues,22 a persistent viral infection in this special lymphoid tissue may lead to a chronic inflammatory process resulting in injury and scar formation.",

Animal models in which virus inoculation is performed directly into the lacrimal sac may also help to assess the mucosal changes that viruses can reveal in this region.
