Airway occlusion by necrotic epithelial cell debris, leukocytes, and fibrin is seen (see Figure 23.1\n).

This was examined in a study of GPAdV naturally infected guinea pigs that were used as recipients of a human adenoviral vector carrying the gene for green fluorescent protein (Hankenson et al., 2010). In this model system, no difference in transfection-efficiency was seen in guinea pigs naturally infected with GPAdV or GPAdV-free.",

A similar disease was described by Rohrer in 1958 (Van Hoosier and Robinette, 1976). In these investigations, sera from affected guinea pigs reacted positively to Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) antigens. Clinical signs involved a flaccid paralysis and weight loss with an incubation period of 9\u201323 days, and a duration of 1\u20132 weeks. Affected animals had meningomyeloencephalitis. More recently, two pet shop guinea pigs were reported to suffer from rear limb paresis and generalized debilitation. The guinea pigs had extremely high titers against \u201cpoliovirus\u201d, while healthy guinea pigs from the same pet shop were negative (Hansen et al., 1997). The diseased guinea pigs recovered fully after treatment with vitamin C in the drinking water. Further testing of other guinea pig colonies by the same authors demonstrated antibody responses to TMEV in 35 out of 152 laboratory guinea pig sera. Positive results were found in two out of six breeding centers, and in three out of three experimental units, all of which purchased guinea pigs from one of the seropositive breeding colonies. Guinea pig sera from some of the breeding units were also positive serologically for other infections; adenovirus, PVM, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, SV5 and Encephalitozoon cuniculi. In experimental studies of susceptibility of laboratory animals to six strains of human poliovirus, newborn guinea pigs were the only species of laboratory animals in which multiplication of any of the viruses could not be detected (Koroleva et al., 1975).",

In one study, C. difficile was recovered by culture in one out of eight normal guinea pigs and 18 out of 34 guinea pigs with typhilitis. Oral or parenteral antibiotic administration, including penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, spiramycin, aureomycin, erythromycin, and bacitracin, have all been implicated in causing antibiotic-associated typhilitis by permitting an overgrowth of primarily Gram-negative organisms including toxin-producing Clostridium such as C. difficile (Young et al., 1987). The enteric flora of guinea pigs is primarily Gram-positive and those antibiotics that target Gram-positive organisms preferentially are of greatest risk to cause this disease (Farrar and Kent, 1965). One study demonstrated that in the 24\u201348 hours post-administration of penicillin, there was a significant increase in Gram-negative anaerobic and aerobic (coliforms predominantly) bacteria bringing the levels of coliform bacteria from less than 100 organisms per gram to 108\u2013109 organisms per gram. This shift in the normal gut flora allows bacteria such as C. difficile, which is generally nearly undetectable, to predominate (Farrar and Kent, 1965, Fox, 2002, Percy and Barthold, 2007). Other Gram-negative organisms, E. coli in particular, and other Clostridium spp. also can contribute to disease.",

C. difficile and other enteric pathogens were not isolated, however, several guinea pigs that received clindamycin developed enteritis.

Further research with this isolate was similar to C. pyogenes, in that intraperitoneal administration resulted in disease while intranasal administration did not.

In a retrospective study of urinary bladder calculi in guinea pigs, it was reported that Corynebacterium renale was the most common isolate from urine and bladder samples (Hawkins et al., 2009).

Pododermatitis and exfoliative dermatitis are not usually conditions conducive to lesion drainage and surgical removal (Brown and Donnelly, 2008). Lesions can be cleaned, but the possibility of causing greater trauma to the affected area must be considered. Also, disinfectants that dry out the skin or agents that are cytotoxic to fibroblasts and reduce white blood cell viability and phagocytic efficiency, such as povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine, should be avoided. Long-term antibiotic treatment is necessary, and enrofloxaxin or ciprofloxacin administered twice a day for 2\u20136 months has been reported in the treatment of ulcerative pododermatitis. Use of an analgesic agent, especially a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as meloxicam, is also recommended. Low-level laser therapy, or phototherapy, has been reported as successful in treating bumblefoot by accelerating angiogenesis and stimulating vasodilatation, although such therapy can only be used after the infection is first controlled.",

During this outbreak, 450 guinea pigs died within 33 days of infection, and a short course of listlessness and failure to thrive were the only noted clinical signs prior to death. In less acute cases of S. pneumoniae, guinea pigs display depression and lethargy, anorexia, and have ruffled fur. They may have a wet nose, nasal or ocular discharge (rhinitis, conjunctivitis), sneezing, coughing, dyspnea, or torticollis (head tilt due to otitis media) (Fox, 2002, Wagner et al., 1976). Wagner, Owens, Kusewitt, and Corley reported that otitis media occurred in 177 of 1373 guinea pigs necropsied during a 6-year period in the 1970s (Wagner et al., 1976). Streptococcus pneumoniae was noted in 20% of these cases, and was the most common bacteria isolated. Gupta et al. (1970), reported mastitis caused by S. pneumoniae in two guinea pigs.",

As noted by Cunningham, females are indeed more susceptible to disease than males (Cunningham, 1929, Fox, 2002, Percy and Barthold, 2007). Strain 2 guinea pigs also appear to be more sensitive than other strains (Wagner et al., 1976, Fox, 2002, Percy and Barthold, 2007\n). Transmission is via aerosol, as well as direct contact with abraded skin or oral mucosa (Harkness and Wagnerl 1995; Fox, 2002, Percy and Barthold, 2007). The organism can be transmitted via bite wounds and secondary to abrasion by rough foodstuff (Ganaway, 1976). While this is likely the route of entry for most natural infections, Murphy et al. (1991) showed that the oral mucosa does not need to be abraded in order for entry of the bacterium. The female genital tract can be infected during farrowing (Percy and Barthold, 2007). After initial entrance, the organism travels to the draining lymph node and replicates (Harkness and Wagner, 1995). Cervical lymphadenitis is commonly noted in guinea pigs when the point of entry for infection is via the conjunctiva or nasal mucosa (Harkness and Wagner, 1995).",

While the cerival lymph nodes are the most common site of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus replication and abscessation, any lymph node, and practically any organ, can be affected (Harkness and Wagner, 1995). A common presentation for infection with this organism is an animal that appears in good condition except for a swelling in the neck at the position of the cervical lymph node (Fox, 2002). The swelling is often soft to firm, pus-filled, non-fluctuant and freely moveable (Percy and Barthold, 2007). Cunningham\u2019s (1929) observations were that \u201cin some cases, one or two nodes were greatly enlarged; in others, as in one animal with cervical node involvement, several plum-sized encapsulated abscesses formed a collar across the front and side of the neck\u201d. Depending on what additional organs are affected, torticollis (if middle ear involvement), dyspnea and cyanosis or nasal and ocular discharge (if respiratory involvement), or hematuria and hemoglobinuria (if septic) may be noted (Fox, 2002, Harkness and Wagner, 1995). Abortions, stillbirths and unexpected deaths are possible (Fox, 2002). During epizootic outbreaks, septicemia, acute pneumonia, and high mortality can occur (Harkness and Wagner, 1995).",

Stressful events, such as transport or pregnancy, may trigger an acute fatal pneumonia in carriers or animals with previously inapparent infections. Transmission of B. bronchiseptica is via aerosol spread, direct contact, direct contact with respiratory secretions of infected animals, or fomites (Fox, 2002, Ganaway, 1976). B. bronchiseptica adheres to ciliated respiratory epithelium and causes ciliary paralysis (Fox, 2002). Pathogenic B. bronchiseptica produce adhesion and cytolytic toxins that lead to an inflammatory response, antiphagocytic activity, and dermonecrosis. While not explicitly described in the guinea pig, the impairment in mucociliary clearance caused by the binding of Bordetella is known to reduce the clearance of additional respiratory pathogens in other animal species. The incubation period is 5\u20137 days (Ganaway, 1976). The highest levels of morbidity and mortality due to B. bronchiseptica have been noted in young guinea pigs, as well as strain 2 animals (Fox, 2002, Ganaway, 1976). It is possible for infected animals to develop immunity and clear the organism. Yoda et al. (1972), noted that within 6\u201354 weeks of initial infection, 69 of 79 naturally infected guinea pigs completely recovered from infection.",

It is recommended that rabbits and guinea pigs not be co-housed since guinea pigs are highly susceptible to disease and rabbits are frequently sub-clinical carriers of B. bronchiseptica (Charles River Laboratories, 2011). Rats and other rodents can be additional sources of infection (Rigby, 1976). Antibiotic treatment with fluroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfonamides may successfully resolve clinical signs, but elimination of infection is rare, with animals often reverting to the sub-clinical state. If infection is suspected in a colony, restocking, test and cull, or rederivation may be more beneficial than treatment (Fox, 2002). The efficacy of canine, porcine, human, and autogenous Bordetella vaccines and bacterins has been evaluated by several individuals; reports suggest that these vaccines do not completely protect guinea pigs from infection, but a decrease in the incidence and severity of clinical disease has been noted in experimentally challenged animals (Matherne et al., 1987, Stephenson et al., 1989).",

A subsequent report describes a series of cases submitted for necropsy between 1992 and 1996 in Belgium (Vanrobaeys et al., 1998). In 29 of 33 cases when spirochetes were identified, the presenting complaints were either sudden death or a short course of diarrhea followed by sudden death. Flagellated parasites were seen in 12 animals and lesions consistent with vitamin C deficiency in six cases. Gross necropsy of affected animals most commonly demonstrated liquid, occasionally mucoid or hemorrhagic large intestinal contents, and dilation of the cecum and colon. Histologically, the cecum was characterized by hyperemia, mucosal infiltration of neutrophils, a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, and occasionally, necrosis of crypt epithelium. Lesions involving other organs were present in 30 of the 37 animals identified, suggesting multifactorial disease processes. In a report of a single pet guinea pig, clinical signs of tenesmus, tachycardia, pale mucous membranes, and dehydration were associated with acute rectal prolapse (Helie et al., 2000). Histopathology identified superficial mucosal necrosis and ulceration and congestion with hemorrhage in the intussuscepted segment. Although spirochetes and organisms consistent with Eimeria spp. were seen in the rest of the intestinal tract, no other lesions were noted. B. pilosicoli was identified by PCR.",

In 2006, two breeding facilities of conventional guinea pigs in Korea were examined by conjunctival staining and no positive organisms were seen (Park et al., 2006). A survey of pet guinea pigs with normal conjunctiva, also revealed no positive staining (Coster et al., 2008), which may reflect the sensitivity of the test used or the actual prevalence of C. caviae. In a study using real-time PCR for diagnosis, C. caviae was detected in 12 out of 12 guinea pigs tested, four out of four rabbits, and one dog from samples obtained from a diagnostic laboratory (Pantchev et al., 2010). C. caviae in a second report was identified via PCR from conjunctival swabs from a rabbit, cat, and human that lived in the same household as infected guinea pigs (Lutz-Wohlgroth et al., 2006). Also utilizing PCR and DNA sequencing, C. caviae was detected in foals with conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and coughing, indicating the host range of the species of Chlamydiaceae may continue to be refined as new diagnostic tests are utilized (Gaede et al., 2010).",

Twenty-one were positive by PCR for C. caviae, however, no samples were positive by cytology. As C. caviae is an obligate intracellular pathogen, it cannot be cultured in cell-free media, but only on specific cell lines (Songer and Post, 2005). This is an insensitive and difficult process that is not typically used for diagnosis. Direct fluorescent antibody test and enzyme immunoassays can be used to detect antigens in cytology samples or tissues (Percy and Barthold, 2007, Songer and Post, 2005).",

Citrobacter spp. were isolated from the middle ear, spleen, mammary gland, and kidney of some animals as well as the intestinal tract, suggesting an ability to cause varied disease in guinea pigs that are not populated with normal flora. Second, an epizootic of Citrobacter spp. septicemia in a large colony of conventional guinea pigs was reported (Ocholi et al., 1988). Animals presented with diarrhea, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. Mortality in weanlings and breeders was 115 of 1300 animals. Gross necropsy revealed lung consolidation with pleural adhesions as well as enteritis and thickening of the intestinal wall. Fibrinous pneumonia and septic thrombi in the capillaries of the lung, liver, and spleen were seen histopathologically.

In two reports, affected animals have also had large numbers of spirochetes evident at necropsy (McLeod et al., 1977, Zwicker et al., 1978).",

Therefore, diagnosis typically relies on characteristic lesions and organisms observed on histopathology using a Warthin-Starry silver stain or Giemsa stain (Percy and Barthold, 2007). PCR has been used to detect C. piliforme in feces from rats (Furukawa et al., 2002). Nested PCR was developed to increase the specificity of detection in tissues, better separating C. piliforme from other closely related organisms used conserved regions of 16S ribosomal RNA (Niepceron and Licois, 2010). Serology to detect antibodies has been used to monitor colonies for this organism (Boot and Walvoort, 1984, Kraft and Meyer, 1990).",

In addition, there is one report of a compilation of cases of mastitis in guinea pigs from a diagnostic lab over a four year period (Kinkler et al., 1976). Of the 26 cases where cultures were taken, E. coli was found in 17 cases with the next most common isolate being Klebsiella pneumonia in six cases. Diagnosis may be obtained by culture of affected organs on MacConkey agar and differentiation from other enteric Gram-negative bacteria by a number of biochemical reactions such as indole production and utilization of certain sugars (Greenwood, 2007).",

Two cagemates of this guinea pig, that had the same steroid treatment, died at days 13 and 30. One had diarrhea for two days prior to death. Histopathology revealed acute enteritis with mucosal erosions without mucosal hyperplasia in both animals. Bacteria similar to that seen in the first case were found in the epithelial cells.

Entry via the conjunctiva has also been reported in guinea pig epizootics (Iijima et al., 1987, Moore, 1957). Additionally, ingestion of contaminated blood or tissue can transmit Salmonella (Fox, 2002). Stressed animals, due to conditions such as weaning, parturition, old age or poor nutrition, are more susceptible to infection (Quesenberry and Carpenter, 2004). Recovered animals can develop an asymptomatic carrier state with intermittent shedding in the feces, making elimination of this bacterium from a colony difficult (Fox, 2002, Harkness and Wagner, 1995, Percy and Barthold, 2007). The incubation time for Salmonella is 5\u20137 days and epizootic or enzootic patterns of infection are possible (Fox, 2002, Ganaway, 1976).",

Their importance as pathogens is clear in that the majority of dermatophytes infecting animals are zoonotic (Chermette et al., 2008). Originally, the dermatophytes were organized into three anamorphic, or asexual, genera, Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton. The primary structure associated with asexual reproduction is the conidium and classification into these genera was based on the morphology of the macroconidia in culture. Subsequent studies revealed sexual reproduction in certain Microsporum and Trichophyton spp. that occurs by means of an ascospore found within an ascus. The dermatophyte sexual states (teleomorphs) are classified in the genus, Arthroderma (Weitzman and Summerbell, 1995). Recent efforts at phylogenetic analysis and identification of dermatophytes have been achieved by sequencing 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions flanking 5.8S rDNA (Drouot et al., 2009, Frealle et al., 2007, Symoens et al., 2011). Dermatophyte species can also be divided into three groups determined by their adaptation to a certain habitat. Human-associated dermatophytes are anthropophilic (e.g. Trichophyton rubrum), those primarily found on animals and occasionally infecting humans are zoophilic (e.g. Trichophyton mentagrophytes), and species persisting in the soil are termed geophilic (e.g. Microsporum gypseum) (Weitzman and Summerbell, 1995), however some overlap does occur. Zoophilic and geophilic dermatophytes infecting humans cause a more intense inflammatory reaction than anthropophilic species (Weitzman and Summerbell, 1995).",

            "text": "Dermatophytosis in animals is most often caused by the anamorph species Microsporum and Trichophyton, however the infecting species can vary with the geographic region (Bond, 2010). Of these genera, Trichophyton mentagrophytes is the most common cause (Aho, 1980, Balsari et al., 1981, Drouot et al., 2009, Feuerman et al., 1975, Lopez-Martinez et al., 1984, McAleer, 1980a, McAleer, 1980b, Papini et al., 1997, Pombier and Kim, 1975, Stenwig, 1985, Vangeel et al., 2000). T. mentagrophytes is a species complex with several variants including both anthropophilic and zoophilic pathogens. Pollock (2003) considered T. mentagrophytes var mentagrophytes as the most common variant infecting rodents, however the specific variant is not always reported in the literature. The teleomorphs are known for the T. mentagrophytes complex and there are two, Arthroderma benhamiae and A. vanbreuseghemii. The A. benhamiae genome has been sequenced (Burmester et al., 2011). The different variants and sexual states of the T. mentagrophytes complex coupled with more recent phylogenetic analyses presents confusion about proper nomenclature and species assignment (Drouot et al., 2009, Fumeaux et al., 2004). Infection with either M. canis or M. gypseum has also been reported in the guinea pig but less frequently (Feuerman et al., 1975, Papini et al., 1997).",

Arthroconidium produced by septation of hyphae are infectious and persist in the environment for months to years (Bond, 2010, Weitzman and Summerbell, 1995). Hyphae invade the stratum corneum eventually colonizing the hair follicles.

When present, lesions are most common on the head and appear to begin on the nose or muzzle and then can spread over the body to the trunk and limbs (Figure 23.2\n). Circumscribed or irregular lesions with combinations of alopecia, scale, crust, erythema, and ulceration develop, with or without pruritis, and spontaneous remission is possible (Drouot et al., 2009, McAleer, 1980a, Pollock, 2003, Pombier and Kim, 1975). Pustules may be associated with the lesions due to secondary bacterial infections. Furthermore, in one outbreak of T. mentagrophytes, affected animals were in poor body condition and there was approximately 50% mortality in young guinea pigs (Pombier and Kim, 1975). Onychomycosis is rare in the guinea pig (Drouot et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Microscopy and culture are the primary means of diagnosing dermatophytosis. Wood\u2019s lamp can be used as a screening tool for M. canis and infected hairs will fluoresce with an apple-green color. However, false negatives can occur (Chermette et al., 2008). Hairs are plucked or the skin scraped from the periphery of an active lesion or from the whole lesion if there is no evidence of inflammation and samples placed in 10% potassium hydroxide to remove keratin. The samples are then examined for hair or skin invasion with hyphae and/or arthroconidia. To increase sensitivity, fluorescent microscopy with Calcofluor white and Congo red can be used (Bond, 2010, Robert and Pihet, 2008). Geimsa staining will also identify arthroconidia. All the dermatophytes infecting guinea pigs will have ectothrix hair shaft involvement. Prior to obtaining a skin or hair sample for culture, the area should be wiped with alcohol to reduce contamination. Saprophytic fungi contamination of the fur may hinder isolation of dermatophytes (Aho, 1983). Hair, skin, or crusts are collected using a sterile toothbrush, swab, forceps, scalpel blade, or surgical scrub brush and placed onto culture medium. Sabouraud\u2019s dextrose agar supplemented with cyclohexamide and chloramphenicol is commonly used. Dermatophyte Test Medium is available, however contamination can cause both false-positive and false-negative results (Robert and Pihet, 2008). If the animal is simply a mechanical carrier, results of repeated testing will vary (Chermette et al., 2008). Biopsy samples can be stained with periodic acid-Schiff or silver stains to detect arthroconidia and hyphae (Figure 23.3\n) (Chermette et al., 2008). As mentioned earlier, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of ITS and 28S ribosomal DNA (Drouot et al., 2009, Fumeaux et al., 2004, Symoens et al., 2011) will identify isolates, and mating experiments can be performed (Hironaga et al., 1981).",

Assuring a well-managed facility with no overcrowding, parasite control, and proper temperature and humidity regulation are important preventive components (Pollock, 2003;\nPombier and Kim, 1975). Infected animals should be removed, the environment thoroughly decontaminated and any items that cannot be disinfected should be discarded. Animal care staff should wear proper personal protective equipment when handling potentially contaminated items or bedding since zoonosis is a concern (McAleer, 1980a). Dilute bleach, benzalkonium chloride, and glutaraldehyde are effective surface disinfectants (Pollock, 2003). In a laboratory setting, it is doubtful that animals will be treated for ringworm.

The defining and unique feature of the phylum is the presence of a polar filament (tube) in the mature spore (Wasson and Peper, 2000). The microsporidia also have one of the smallest genomes of any eukaryote and lack several key features, such as typical mitochondria. Long thought to be protozoa, certain characteristics indicated that these organisms were fungi-like such as presence of a chitinous spore wall, genes for trehalose metabolism, and intranuclear division (Brosson et al., 2006, Dunn and Smith, 2001). Recently, Lee et al. (2008) concluded that microsporidia are true fungi related to zygomycetes. Of the microsporidial species infecting humans, Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most common with lesser, but still significant, numbers of cases due to the Encephalitozoon spp. The majority of patients are immunocompromised as a result of HIV infection, AIDS, or are organ transplant recipients. However, healthy immune-competent persons are also susceptible to disease (Didier and Weiss, 2006, Mathis et al., 2005). Animals are hosts for those common species strongly supporting their zoonotic potential.",

Environmentally resistant spores are shed in feces, urine, and mucus and then ingested or inhaled. Transplacental transmission has been documented in the rabbit (Baneux and Pognan, 2003) and has been claimed in the guinea pig (Boot et al., 1988). Predictably, primary sites of infection commonly include the small intestine, respiratory tract, and placenta. An unknown signal triggers the polar filament (tube) to be extruded from the spore and infectious sporoplasm is injected into the host cell cytoplasm. The sporoplasm then divides into meronts (merogony) that differentiate through intermediary forms before becoming mature spores (sporogony). For E. cuniculi and other Encephalitozoon spp., developing spores are packaged in a parasitophorous vacuole. The host cell ruptures releasing spores that commonly disseminate to the kidney, liver, and brain. Host protection from infection is primarily achieved by cell-mediated immunity with lesser contributions from the humoral immune system (Khan et al., 2001).\n",

Focal to multifocal granulomatous encephalitis may be evident in different regions of the brain, with or without associated necrosis, and perivascular and meningeal mononuclear cell infiltrate (Moffatt and Schiefer, 1973, Wan et al., 1996).

In the kidney, interstitial nephritis and necrosis, fibrosis, perivascular cuffing and tubular ectasia have all been described (Boot et al., 1988, Gannon, 1980, Moffatt and Schiefer, 1973). Here, organisms may occasionally be visualized in renal epithelial cells and collecting tubule lumens. Absence of typical lesions in the brain or kidney in a seropositive animal may be due to the multifocal nature of the lesions and insufficient sections being analyzed (Gannon, 1980, Wan et al., 1996).

While indistinct with hematoxylin and eosin staining, spores are periodic acid-Schiff, Gram, and modified trichrome positive (Figure 23.4\n). Chemofluorescent agents such as Calcofluor white can also be used (Garcia, 2002) and spores are birefringent (Tiner, 1988). PCR primers are available (Baneux and Pognan, 2003, Ghosh and Weiss, 2009) providing a fast and easily interpretable means of diagnosis and the genome for E. cuniculi has recently been sequenced providing further opportunities for novel molecular diagnostic strategies (Katinka et al., 2001).

Transmission is by direct contact, with nymphal or larval stages indicated in establishing new infestations (Baker, 2007, Rothwell et al., 1991).

Severe pruritis and excoriation along with erythema and alopecia can accompany dermatitis in some animals (Ackerman, 1987, Beck et al., 2007, Dorrestein and Vanbronswijk, 1979). In those guinea pigs that are clinical, grayish to yellow or white crusts may be present on the skin and can be dry or slightly greasy (Ackerman, 1987, Dorrestein and Vanbronswijk, 1979). Secondary bacterial infections of infected skin areas are possible (Fuentealba and Hanna, 1996). Infection usually starts on the face and ears, spreading to the lumbar regions and lateral aspects of the legs (Dorrestein and Vanbronswijk, 1979, Percy and Barthold, 2007). The intense pruritic response in some guinea pigs is reported to be due to an initial allergic reaction to mite antigen (Fox, 2002). Extreme restlessness and emaciation have been noted in affected animals, especially in those that seemingly scratch uncontrollably (Beck et al., 2007). This constant scratching can lead to \u201cfits\u201d of muscular spasms or sporadic epileptiform seizures (Ackerman, 1987, Beck et al., 2007, Dorrestein and Vanbronswijk, 1979, Kummel et al., 1980) caused by generalized pruritus-induced hyperesthesia (Baker, 2007).",

A polymorphonuclear leucocytic infiltrate is present in the dermis (Dorrestein and Vanbronswijk, 1979, Percy and Barthold, 2007, Rothwell et al., 1991, Zenoble and Greve, 1980). Adult mites may be noted in \u201ctunnels\u201d or burrows located in the hyperkeratotic areas (Dorrestein and Vanbronswijk, 1979, Zenoble and Greve, 1980). Such tunnels approach the epidermis perpendicularly, with some entering the mouth of hair follicles (Zenoble and Greve, 1980). Eggs may also be present in tunnels (Dorrestein and Vanbronswijk, 1979). T. caviae mites have sharp spines on the cuticle of their dorsums (Zenoble and Greve, 1980), which differentiates them from Notoedres (Ackerman, 1987). The anus of the female T. caviae mite is located dorsally, while this structure is located terminally on S. scabiei (Ackerman, 1987, Fuentealba and Hanna, 1996, Baker, 2007).",
