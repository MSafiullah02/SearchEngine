Today, it is well known that glucocorticoids can have harmful effects on many tissues and can produce numerous adverse effects throughout the body, mainly depending on the dose, the administration route, and the duration of treatment (Table 11.1). Since 1957 when the first case of glucocorticoid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis (GI-FHON) was reported [3], many human and animal studies have reported an association between glucocorticoids and FHON. To date, glucocorticoids have been considered the most common cause of nontraumatic FHON [4]. Nevertheless, pathophysiological mechanisms and effective preventive or therapeutic strategies against GI-FHON have not yet been completely established.\n",

Many human studies have described associations between glucocorticoid doses and the prevalences of GI-FHON, while others have not. For example, a study analyzing 24 cohorts receiving glucocorticoids reported a 4.6 % increase in GI-FHON development as the doses of oral prednisone increase by 10 mg/day [24]. Animal models have shown that higher doses are more likely to develop GI-FHON [25]. It has been reported that rabbits are more susceptible to the development of GI-FHON when treated with methylprednisolone than to prednisolone or triamcinolone in [26], although there is no similar evidence in humans. Among rabbits receiving methylprednisolone, those with increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increased free fatty acids, or decreased hepatic cytochrome P4503A activity are at high risk of developing GI-FHON [27, 28].",

However, cumulative or the highest dose has been heterogeneously reported as a risk factor by different investigators. Additionally, methylprednisolone pulse therapy and cytotoxic agents have also been found to be related to GI-FHON [29\u201332]. Generally, SLE patients with more active diseases are more likely to receive glucocorticoids in higher doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy or cytotoxic agents. However, there are discrepancies regarding results on SLE disease activity between patients with and without the development of GI-FHON [33, 34]. The majority of GI-FHON cases develop within 3\u201312 months of initiation of glucocorticoid treatment [8, 31]. Increases in glucocorticoid doses secondary to a relapse of SLE may be associated with GI-FHON [34].",

Just after transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy, including glucocorticoids, is needed to prevent and treat acute graft rejection and to avoid chronic graft damage. It has been shown that the risk of GI-FHON is associated with glucocorticoid doses [14, 38, 39]. In particular, the total dose of glucocorticoids during the first 7 months can have a significant risk [14, 38]. Introduction of immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, can decrease the incidence of GI-FHON in kidney transplant patients [38] because these immunosuppressants reduce glucocorticoids doses. An association of the incidence of GI-FHON with a history of acute rejection is not consistently reported [14, 39].",

Thus, many treatment regimens include glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone. Since the prevalence of ALL is higher in children than in adults, most GI-FHON studies in ALL patients have been conducted on pediatric patients. ALL patients at the age of >10 years increase the risk of GI-FHON [16, 20\u201322, 43, 44], and old age is also an independent risk factor in adult patients with MM [18]. Additionally, female patients have a higher risk of GI-FHON than males [20, 21, 43, 44]. Intensive therapy with dexamethasone confers a high incidence of GI-FHON [20, 22], and alternate-week scheduling of dexamethasone can reduce the development of GI-FHON [43, 44]. In some studies, patients receiving dexamethasone more frequently developed FHON than those receiving prednisone [43]. An association between FHON and poor dexamethasone clearance has been reported [22]. In patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, both an episode of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the use of glucocorticoid are risk factors [17]. The incidence of GI-FHON has been reported to be higher in patients receiving unrelated donor transplants than in those receiving allogenic matched related donor or autologous transplants [17, 45].",

Osteoblast-/osteocyte-specific 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2, the enzyme metabolizes glucocorticoids into inactive metabolites) transgenic mice protect from prednisolone-induced decrease in osteoblast survival, osteoblast number, and bone formation [48]. On the other hand, the survival of osteoclasts can be prolonged by glucocorticoids [49]. The interaction of receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a major determinant of osteoclastogenesis. RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) are essential for osteoclastogenesis, while OPG prevents RANKL from binding to RANK, resulting in inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Glucocorticoids increase RANKL and M-CSF expression and decrease OPG expression by human osteoblastic and stromal cells in culture [50, 51]. From the results of studies using mice with conditional osteoclast-specific deletion of glucocorticoid receptors [52], glucocorticoids inhibit proliferation of osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Such glucocorticoid-induced suppression of osteoclasts induces blunting of osteoblast function in the context of osteoclast-osteoblast interactions throughout bone remodeling [53]. Also, glucocorticoids suppress the secretion of sex hormones and the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2, insulin growth factor 1, and osteocalcin [54, 55]. Furthermore, calcium absorption from the kidney and intestine is disturbed by glucocorticoids [54].",

The femurs from patients with GI-FHON show many apoptotic osteocytes, anatomically juxtaposed to the osteonecrotic fractures [57]. Glucocorticoid-induced osteocyte apoptosis results in the mechanosensory dysfunction of the osteocyte network and consequently leads to impairment of bone repair processes.

In addition, glucocorticoids can cause adipocyte hypertrophy through increased synthesis and storage of lipids [59]. It has been shown that the number and area of fat cells increase in the bone marrow after exposure to glucocorticoids [60, 61]. These changes can generate compression of venous sinusoids and congestion in the bone marrow. As a result, adequate arterial blood flow may not be achieved due to increases in intraosseous pressures, eventually leading to osteonecrosis [62].",

Chronic administration of glucocorticoids inhibits the synthesis of vasorelaxants, such as prostaglandin E1, prostacyclin, and endothelial nitric oxide (NO), via a suppression phospholipase A2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [63]. In addition, glucocorticoids indirectly increase vascular tone through the upregulation of angiotensin II type I receptor and \u03b1-1 adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells [64]. Furthermore, glucocorticoids can stimulate the synthesis of vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 and potentiate its vasoconstricting effect in vascular smooth muscle cells [65]. There is some evidence that glucocorticoids increase reactive oxidative stress species (ROS) which decrease NO availability [66]. Thus, glucocorticoids can cause dysregulation of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation. Furthermore, higher doses of dexamethasone were reported to result in microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis and could lead to capillary rarefaction in a glucocorticoid-induced hypertension model [67]. This may be involved in glucocorticoid-induced hypertension and hypercoagulability. The effect of glucocorticoids on the coagulation system is discussed below.",

In a dexamethasone-induced FHON rabbit model, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene therapy improved the repair process of osteonecrosis [68]. Glucocorticoids suppress expression of VEGF and increase expression of antiangiogenic thrombospondin-1 [69, 70]. Glucocorticoid-induced suppression of matrix metalloproteinases and plasminogen activators may affect the proangiogenic process through impairment of basement membrane turnover [71]. It has also been shown that GCs can inhibit capillary growth by reducing collagen synthesis by myofibroblasts [72]. Because cartilage components released from subchondral fracture sites have been considered antiangiogenic, the negative effects of glucocorticoids on angiogenesis may be potentiated in the subchondral bone tissue in FHON cases [73].",

The plasma level of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a marker of endothelial cell damage because the vWF is synthesized and stored in the endothelial cells. Plasma vWF levels are reported to increase in subjects with exogenous or endogenous excess glucocorticoids, and dexamethasone induces the expression of vWF, cell adhesion molecules, and tissue factor in vascular endothelial cells [75]. Since vWF is involved in platelet aggregation and adhesion, glucocorticoid-induced endothelial damage may contribute to thrombi formation.",

Therefore, MRI should be performed in all patients with osteonecrosis to assess the extent of the disease. Three-dimensional MRI with image registration can be used to assess changes in lesion size [76, 88]. Bone scan may be helpful when x-ray findings are normal and when MRI cannot be performed.

The results of studies using MRI to diagnose asymptomatic GI-FHON are summarized in Table 11.3 [7, 11, 78\u201383]. About one-third of patients with asymptomatic early GI-FHON have symptomatic or radiological progression over a period of several years. Thus, clinical progression or subchondral collapse rate seems to be lower than the other subtypes of nontraumatic FHON, especially FHON associated with sickle cell anemia. Sometimes small lesions of GI-FHON are reported to be spontaneously resolved [81\u201383]. However, as with other subtypes, femoral head collapse develops most often in GI-FHON patients with larger osteonecrosis areas (>15\u201330 %), lesions occupying the weight-bearing surface, higher radiographic stages, or hip pain [84]. There is no established risk stratification system to exactly estimate outcomes in GI-FHON patients.

Among them, the preventive effect of statin and warfarin was evaluated in patients receiving glucocorticoids; the results concerning statin effects were controversial [85, 86], and warfarin treatment only tended to decrease symptomatic GI-FHON cases in SLE patients [87]. Additionally, enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, is not helpful in GI-FHON patients [88]. A single-arm study reported that intravenous infusion of prostaglandin I2 for 5 days decreased pain and radiographic outcomes in patients with bone marrow edema or early nontraumatic FHON [89]. However, some evidence suggests that alendronate is a candidate drug for the treatment of early GI-FHON. Although 7 (18 %) of the 40 study subjects had GI-FHON, a randomized controlled study demonstrated that alendronate (70 mg/week for 25 weeks) could significantly prevent the collapse of the femoral head in FHON patients with Steinberg stage IIC or IIIC [90]. A prospective open-label study, where 28 (47 %) of the 60 patients had GI-FHON, showed symptomatic improvement and minimal or no radiographic progression after 1 year of follow-up [91]. In another prospective study that included 26 (79 %) of the 33 patients with GI-FHON, alendronate (5 mg/day for 1 year) decreased the frequency of the femoral head collapse [92]. When the add-on effect of alendronate was studied for 4 years, combination therapy of multiple drilling and alendronate showed a significant benefit in GI-FHON patients with Ficat stages II and III [93]. However, a 2-year randomized double-blind study where 12 (23 %) of the 52 patients developed GI-FHON reported no significant effects in the 52 patients at stage IIC or IIIC [94]. Thus, further studies are warranted to confirm that alendronate is a potential option to postpone the need for hip surgery in patients with GI-FHON.",

            "text": "Recently, stem cell-based therapy has attracted attention. Because GI-FHON is believed to have limited reparative capacity partially secondary to decreased proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells, the approach could be acceptable [95]. In rabbit GI-FHON models, cell-based therapies using autologous bone marrow or mesenchymal stem cells, peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells, or endogenital progenitor cells showed beneficial effects on progression prevention, vascularization, and bone regeneration of the femoral head [96\u201399]. A pilot controlled study was performed using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells in 18 patients with early stage (I and II) FHON. Direct implantation of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells into the femoral head resulted in a significant decrease in symptoms and collapse rate at 2 years [100]. In an observational study of SLE patients with GI-FHON, concentrated autologous bone marrow aspirate transplantation improved joint pain and resulted in a 40 % radiographic progression rate over a period of 41 months in patients with type C2 lesions [101]. Although several preclinical results showed promising benefits, cell-based therapies have not been widely used to treat GI-FHON, and there are no long-term and large-scale studies. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the availability and safety of the stem cell-based therapies in human patients.",

Although the pathophysiological mechanisms have not yet been fully deduced, accumulation of glucocorticoid effects can lead to the development of GI-FHON in subjects with a genetic predisposition or an underlying disease that threatens bone and vascular tissue. The clinical features of GI-FHON are not different from those of other FHON. Clinical progression or subchondral collapse rates may be similar to or lower in asymptomatic GI-FHON than in other subtypes of nontraumatic FHON. Total hip replacement is eventually needed in many symptomatic cases. Efforts to use the minimal effective dose and to appropriately taper doses of glucocorticoids are essential to preventing GI-FHON. More studies are necessary to establish the effects of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic joint-preserving therapies in patients with early stage GI-FHON.",
