Mechanisms implicated in virus/host cells interaction are central for cell infection and replication that in turn lead to disease onset and local damage. To enter airway and lung epithelia, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to ACE2 receptors by spike (S) glycoproteins. Molecular mechanisms that promote interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and host with particular focus on virus cell entry receptor ACE2 are described. We further explore the impact of underlying medical conditions and therapies including renin-angiotensin inhibitors on modulating ACE 2, which is the major SARS-CoV-2 cell entry receptor.",

However, risk of increase susceptibility to infection linked to ACE2 upregulation due to RAS inhibitors remains uncertain and needs to be clarified. Fang et al. based on higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular diseases among patients who died from COVID-19 postulated that ACE-I or ARBs might favour severe disease progression [46] . However, more recently, in a multicentre retrospective study including 1,128 COVID-19 inpatients with hypertension, the use of ACE-I/ARBs was associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92; P \u00bc 0.03) and septic shock (adjusted HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.84; P \u00bc 0.01) compared with ACE-I/ARB non-use. Unfortunately, the study was not designed to detect differences between ACE-I and ARBs and overall the patient number in ACE-I/ARB group was limited (188/1128; 16.6%) [47] . These data support the statements of European Society of Cardiology [48] , American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America and the American College of Cardiology [49] , International Society of Hypertension [50] , Italian Society of Pharmacology [51] and European Society of Hypertension [52] that recommend against ACE-I or sartans discontinuation in light of the current evidences.",
