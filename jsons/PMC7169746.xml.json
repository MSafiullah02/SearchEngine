            "text": "The White River is the largest river basin in Arkansas in terms of drainage area (44,400 km2 within Arkansas; 71,911 km2 total in Arkansas and Missouri) and drains 34% of the state (Robison and Buchanan 1988). The White River forms in northwestern Arkansas, flows northward into Missouri, and then flows southward back into Arkansas. The White River flows almost the length of the state before flowing into the Mississippi River at river kilometer (rkm) 964 (rkm 0 = mouth of the Mississippi River), just north of the Arkansas River confluence. The upper White River in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri is impounded by four dams that create a series of large reservoirs (Beaver, Table Rock, Bull Shoals, and Norfork lakes). The lower 476 km of the river below Batesville, Arkansas, is free flowing, has an active floodplain, and typifies a lowland warmwater river. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains a navigation channel by dredging throughout the lower 400 km of the river (2.4 m deep upstream through rkm 320; 1.4 m deep to rkm 400). This section of the river contains no entrainment structures, such as bank revetments or dike fields. The lower section of the river also has several large, free\u2010flowing tributaries (e.g., Buffalo, Black, and Cache rivers) that moderate thermal effects of upstream dams (K. Shirley, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, unpublished data). The White River National Wildlife Refuge (WRNWR) is located between rkm 16 and 161. The refuge contains about 65,000 ha of bottomland hardwood forest floodplain habitat and approximately 360 floodplain lakes with surface areas exceeding 0.2 km2 (2 ha). The floodplain also contains hundreds of smaller (<0.2\u2010km2) lakes and numerous interconnected sloughs and bayous. Seasonal flood pulses are the primary mechanism by which these floodplain lakes become seasonally connected to the White River; some lakes become highly connected to the main river channel and others do not (Lubinski 2004). The WRNWR is typically inundated with spring floodwaters from March to late April or May, although the duration varies among years.",

            "text": "A total of 16 floodplain lakes within the WRNWR were selected for this study (Figure 1). Floodplain lakes were emphasized because they are important floodplain habitats and support a major proportion of the riverine fish fauna. In this study, 64 of 95 species recorded from the lower White River (Robison and Buchanan 1988; Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, unpublished data) were collected. Lake selection was based on several factors that included lake size and boat access for sampling. Although fewer than 50 of the refuge's lakes were accessible by boat, selection of study areas was done randomly from these lakes. Based on examination of refuge maps and consultation with WRNWR personnel, selected lakes were judged to be representative of all lakes present in the system. We did consider that the selected lakes potentially represented a biased subset of all lakes because they were boat accessible and subject to angling effort differing from that in nonaccessible lakes. However, on\u2010site observations indicated that at least some angling effort occurred in nearly all lakes, even those without road or boat access.",

Four modified mini\u2010fyke nets were fished per lake during summer (July\u2013August) 2002 for approximately 24 h. Mini\u2010fyke nets had 3\u2010mm bar mesh and were fished in littoral\u2010zone areas less than 10 m from shore to target small\u2010bodied littoral\u2010zone fishes (Gutreuter et al. 1995; Clark et al. 2007). Also during summer 2002, three monofilament experimental gill nets (8.1 m long; 2.4 m deep) were fished per lake. Gill nets were fished concurrently with the mini\u2010fyke nets in each lake and deployed in limnetic\u2010zone areas up to several meters deep. Gill nets targeted larger\u2010bodied limnetic and benthic species. The nets had five different equal\u2010area mesh sizes (2.54, 3.81, 5.08, 6.35, and 7.62 cm2) to reduce fish size selectivity (Hubert 1996). Gill nets were fished for 4 h in the morning from approximately 0700 to 1100 hours; 4\u2010h sets were used instead of overnight sets to help reduce fish mortality from stress and predator impacts (e.g., turtles and American alligators Alligator mississippiensis). Boat\u2010mounted nighttime electrofishing was conducted during fall (October\u2013November) 2002 with a pulsed\u2010DC Smith\u2010Root 7.5 generator\u2010powered pulsator electrofisher (Smith\u2010Root, Inc., Vancouver, Washington). Six 10\u2010min electrofishing samples were taken in each lake; three samples were taken at 15 Hz and three were taken at 60 Hz to target the widest variety of scaled and scaleless fishes (Schramm and Pugh 2000). Nighttime electrofishing was conducted from approximately 1 h after sunset to 1 h before sunrise in littoral\u2010zone areas only. Electrofishing output settings were standardized based on water temperature and conductivity to achieve an approximately standard power output of 3,000 W during all sampling (Burkhardt and Gutreuter 1995). In combination, the three gear types were expected to adequately sample the lake fish communities in terms of species composition and size structure.",

            "text": "Environmental variables that were expected to affect fish communities were measured or estimated concurrently with fish sampling. Lake morphometric variables were estimated once and assumed to be constant throughout the study. Mean depth measurements of each lake were determined by traveling zigzag patterns across each lake with a portable depth finder and recording depth every 10 s. Maximum depth in each lake was determined from these measurements. A length : width ratio for each lake was calculated as the lake length (longest axis) divided by the lake width (perpendicular to this axis), as determined from topographic maps in Delorme 3\u2010D TopoQuads mapping software (Delorme, Yarmouth, Maine). In interpreting length : width ratios, 1.0 represented a lake that was perfectly round. Lake distance from the main river channel was also determined with Delorme 3\u2010D TopoQuads software. Lake surface areas were determined from a geographic information systems database maintained by the WRNWR. Degree of flooding was a qualitative estimate of river\u2013floodplain connectivity based on a rating method similar to that of Miranda (2005). The WRNWR field personnel working in refuge lakes were asked to classify each lake on a three\u2010point scale in which 1 represented a lake that flooded infrequently, 3 represented a lake that flooded frequently, and 2 represented an intermediate lake. Morphoedaphic index (MEI) values for each lake were calculated by dividing the total dissolved solids (TDS) measure by lake mean depth following the methods of Ryder et al. (1974). Lakes also were classified according to their location in the south unit (scored as 1) or north unit (scored as 2) of the refuge; a highway causeway (Arkansas State Highway 1) served as the dividing boundary between units. This boundary is not arbitrary because the causeway affects flooding patterns in the refuge, both from downstream flows in the White River proper and backflows from the Mississippi River.",

These analyses were designed to identify statistically significant environmental gradients within floodplain lake fish communities and provide a basis for classifying lakes into groups with similar characteristics and fish communities. The CCA is a direct gradient analysis that ordinates a species \u00d7 sample data matrix within the constraint that resulting site scores must be linear combinations of the environmental variables measured (Palmer 1993). Significance of the fish\u2013environment association was assessed by comparing observed eigenvalues from the first three ordination axes with those generated from randomization of the species \u00d7 lake data matrix (10,000 iterations) using a simple Monte Carlo reshuffling algorithm. Rejection of this test meant that observed eigenvalues were greater than those expected by chance (i.e., eigenvalues generated from randomized data), which indicated a significant association between fish communities and environmental variables. Significance level for Monte Carlo analyses was set at 0.05.",

Because units of catch per unit effort (CPUE) varied across gears, data were converted from raw species\u2010specific CPUE data into ranked abundances for each gear, where the species\u2010specific ranks were averaged across gears. All species were used in this ranking procedure; the most abundant species received a rank of 64 (64 species were collected overall), the second most abundant species received a rank of 63, and so forth. In cases where a species was not collected with a particular gear, ranks were considered tied and the mean rank was used. For instance, if a gear collected 44 of the 64 species present (meaning 20 species were not collected), the 20 uncollected species were assigned a mean rank of 10.5. Because ordination analyses can be sensitive to high numbers of rare species in various ways (ter Braak 1995), one CCA was constructed using ranked abundances of all 64 collected species and another CCA was constructed using only those species that constituted more than 0.05% of all collected fishes. This latter CCA contained the 42 most common (i.e., highly ranked) species, which represented 99.7% of all collected fishes. Our elimination of rare species was consistent with studies by Miranda and Lucas (2004) and Miranda (2005), who did similar research, and is sometimes warranted in ordination analyses (McCune and Grace 2002). Gido et al. (2002), Eggleton et al. (2005), and Falke and Gido (2006) represent other ordination examples where rare species were eliminated. However, rare species were included in analyses involving richness, diversity, and evenness.",

These catches produced inflated average ranks for these species and greatly distorted the overall analysis. The two species were subsequently excluded from further analysis, and 42 species contributing 27,197 fishes (99.7% of all fish collected) were included in the final CCA.

Furthermore, the diversity of environmental conditions in the lakes produced somewhat distinctive fish communities. Major environmental gradients related to the structuring of fish communities involved lake depth, lake surface area, water clarity, and TDS; DO played a lesser role. Using these characteristics along the first and second CCA axes, floodplain lakes could be allocated among three main community types. One community type (group 1) came from small, shallow, turbid lakes and was typified by spotted gars, spotted suckers, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, yellow bass, bowfins, white crappies, and cypress minnows. These communities and lakes tended toward the left of the CCA diagram (Figure 2). The second community type (group 2) came from larger lakes with greater water clarity but only medium depth. These lakes contained greater abundances of white bass, common carp, smallmouth buffalo, and emerald shiners and lesser abundances of longnose gars and river carpsuckers. Group 2 communities and lakes tended toward the right side of the CCA diagram (Figure 2). The third community type (group 3) predominated in lakes of intermediate size, greater depth, and high turbidity (i.e., turbidity was similar to that in lakes containing group 1). Species most associated with the third group of lakes were longear sunfish, redear sunfish, common carp, brook silversides, and pugnose minnow. These communities and lakes tended toward the upper middle portion of the CCA diagram (Figure 2). Along the third CCA axis, lakes separated into two main groups distinguished mostly by water clarity (Figure 3). Gizzard shad, threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense, bluegills, largemouth bass, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, and freshwater drum were found in all lakes and showed no tendency toward association with any particular lake group.",

In floodplain lakes of the Brazos River, Texas, water depth, DO, dissolved nutrients, turbidity, and plankton densities accounted for 45\u201359% of the variation in abundance of the dominant species (Winemiller et al. 2000). Lake fish communities were structured along a primary gradient that discriminated between deep, well\u2010oxygenated lakes (dominated by sunfishes, especially longear sunfish) and shallow lakes with low DO (dominated by western mosquitofish). Similar to the Brazos River oxbows, lake depth played an important role in the structuring of floodplain lake fish communities in this study, and DO was secondarily important. Deeper floodplain lakes in this study were characterized by fish communities consisting of several sunfish species, white bass, and common carp. Deeper lakes also tended to be clearer and larger, and the dominant species were several sight\u2010feeding and schooling predators (e.g., sunfishes and white bass; Robison and Buchanan 1988). Shallower lakes, which also tended to be small and turbid, contained higher abundances of white crappies, spotted gars, spotted suckers, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, bowfins, and several small\u2010bodied minnow species. Many of these species are fairly omnivorous in their feeding or specialize on bottom feeding (Robison and Buchanan 1988). Although DO was considered secondarily important in fish community structure, this latter list includes several species that are tolerant to low\u2010DO conditions (e.g., spotted gars, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and bowfins) and suggests that smaller, more shallow floodplain lakes periodically contain hypoxic conditions. A more thorough characterization of floodplain lake environmental conditions that includes seasonal and diel components would be required to better assess this possibility.",

In our study, although lake area and depth were important in structuring fish communities and some similar fish\u2013environment relationships were observed, length : width ratios of lakes were only moderately correlated with axis 1 and were not correlated with the second or third axes.

Deletion of rare species is commonly done in ordination analyses and often enhances the detection of community\u2013environment relationships with several ordination methods (e.g., Austin and Greig\u2010Smith 1968; Day et al. 1971; Callahan et al. 1979; McCune and Grace 2002).

The only difference between the analyses was that the latter was significant. Thus, inclusion of rare species appeared only to have a dampening effect on the overall analysis.

This is consistent with the results of Galat et al. (1998), who reported twice as many fish species in connected floodplain scours than in isolated scours in the lower Missouri River. Miranda (2005) reported similar results in that oxbow lakes that were permanently disconnected from the lower Mississippi River by levee systems consistently had fewer fish species than lakes with at least some connection to the river. Increased richness in more frequently connected lakes also is consistent with the idea that periodic flood pulses allow homogenization or \u201creshuffling\u201d of fish communities between the river channel and floodplain lakes. Miranda (2005) hypothesized that lakes with higher degrees of connectivity (i.e., greater flooding) would be expected to contain a lotic and lentic species that are periodically mixed during flood pulses, whereas lakes with lower degrees of connectivity would contain mostly lentic species. There was some evidence of this possibility from the present study. For example, skipjack herring Alosa chrysochloris, a mostly lotic species, were found exclusively in floodplain lakes with high degrees of flooding (e.g., Brushy, Columbus, Green, Hog Thief, Horseshoe, and Moon lakes). Similarly, saugers Sander canadensis, another lotic species, were only collected in Brushy Lake, which had a higher degree of flooding. Longnose gars, smallmouth buffalo, and white bass, which are more riverine species, were weakly associated with lakes that had higher degrees of flooding. Conversely, results suggested that lentic species, such as yellow bullheads, spotted gars, bowfins, and several minnows, were more associated with lakes exhibiting lower degrees of flooding. Continued research in this area may gain insight into the possibility of whether lake fish communities can be used to ascertain flooding patterns and periodicity in floodplain lakes.",

Lakes that were located farthest from the White River main channel that flooded less frequently may have been more stable through time. Greater stability may have allowed for development of greater levels of fish community diversity, although this is an untested ecological theory. Lakes located farthest from the main river channel tended to be shallower and more turbid and have higher TDS levels and smaller surface areas than lakes situated closer to the river. However, there was no correlation between lake distance from the main river channel and degree of flooding (r = 0.10, P = 0.70), as flooding in these lakes occurred through numerous chutes, side channels, and floodplain ditches that connect these habitats with each other and the main river channel.

The basin contains over 150 native species of fishes and 13 endemic forms (Cross et al. 1986; Buchanan 1997). Fifty\u2010eight species of freshwater mussels also are known from the White River, and three of these species are endemic. Although peer\u2010reviewed scientific literature is mostly lacking, natural resource agencies and private conservation organizations, such as the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission and The Nature Conservancy, regard the lower White River as a major center of biodiversity for the state of Arkansas because of its diversity of aquatic habitats, lack of high levels of regulation, and mostly intact hydrology (Arkansas Wildlife Federation 2002). Results of this study suggest that fish communities in floodplain lakes of the lower White River are structured by multiple environmental variables and that a diversity of floodplain lake conditions is critical for maintaining net ecosystem diversity. Nevertheless, the lower White River is the target of pending and proposed navigation and irrigation projects to support economic development in the Arkansas Delta region. Given that new floodplain lakes are no longer being created naturally in the lower White River, as in the lower Mississippi River (Miranda 2005), understanding fish\u2013environment relationships in river\u2013floodplain ecosystems is an important first step toward managing and conserving riverine fisheries.
