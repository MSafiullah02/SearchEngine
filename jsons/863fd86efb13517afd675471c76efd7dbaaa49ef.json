It is a reasonable technique to employ to destroy warrens in rocky ground or inaccessible country after an efficient poisoning program has been carried out. \u2022 Fumigation may be necessary, but the AVA urges that more effective, humane and less irritant fumigants be developed. \u2022 The use of steel-jawed traps is inhumane and is not an efficient means of controlling rabbits. \u2022 Shooting is humane if the bullet passes through the brain, causing instantaneous loss of consciousness. Shooting through the heart may be more practical in some situations. Shooting is generally not an efficient method of controlling rabbits if no other method is used, but it can be useful to reduce the number of rabbits that survive poisoning or warren ripping. \u2022 Myxomatosis has been an extremely effective agent in rabbit control. Although this disease causes distress to rabbits, it is a necessary part of any comprehensive rabbit control campaign, given the context of the Australian environment. \u2022 The imported calicivirus causes an acute fatal disease in rabbits and has now been released in the field for rabbit control.

Dogs: canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus and canine parvovirus. Cats: feline parvovirus, feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus. \u1b7a Non-core vaccines are required by only those animals whose geographic location, local environment or lifestyle places them at risk of contracting specific infections. Dogs: parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Leptospira interrogans. Cats: feline leukaemia virus, Chlamydia felis and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Feline immunodeficiency virus vaccines may also be classified in this group. \u1b7a Vaccines that have insufficient scientific evidence to justify their use are not recommended. \u2022 The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) believes that in most cases, core vaccines need not be administered any more frequently than triennially and that even less frequent vaccination may be considered appropriate if an individual animal's circumstances warrant it. However, local factors may dictate more frequent vaccination scheduling. These recommendations may be 'off label' for some vaccines. \u2022 Individual animals will require assessment by a veterinarian to select the most appropriate vaccine and vaccination protocol. The veterinarian-client-patient relationship is important to fully understand the individual's needs. \u2022 Revaccination recommendations should aim to create and maintain clinically relevant immunity while minimising the potential for adverse reactions. \u2022 Because of maternally derived antibody and the variability in its level and duration between individuals, vaccines should ideally be administered two to three times to puppies and kittens, with timing of the final dose being variable but not earlier than the age of 16 weeks (the suggested age varies with the manufacturer and the vaccine). If cost is an issue and only one vaccine is possible, it should be at the age of 16 weeks or older. \u2022 A booster vaccine should be administered approximately 12 months later. \u2022 'Off label' use of vaccines will require consultation with the pet owner for informed consent. \u2022 An 'annual health check' is strongly recommended, even if animals are not to be vaccinated. \u2022 Non-core vaccines target diseases that are of limited risk in a geographic region or, based on the lifestyle of the pet, help prevent against diseases that are a less severe health risk to infected animals. \u2022 The decision to use non-core vaccines is made for individual pets based upon consultation between the veterinarian and owner. \u1b7a Many non-core vaccines require annual vaccination. \u2022 Vaccines that the WSAVA VGG considered in their 2007 report should not be recommended at that time included canine coronavirus, Giardia for cats and dogs, feline immunodeficiency virus and feline infectious peritonitis. \u2022 At the time of vaccine administration the following information should be recorded in the patient's permanent medical record: \u1b7a date of vaccination \u1b7a identity of person administering the vaccine \u1b7a vaccine name, batch number and expiry date \u1b7a site and route of administration. \u2022 Adverse vaccine experiences are defined as any side effect, unintended consequence or lack of protection associated with the administration of a vaccine product. This includes any injury, toxicity or hypersensitivity reaction associated with the vaccination, whether or not the event can be attributed directly to the vaccine. Any adverse event should be reported, identifying the product, animal and reaction involved, to the manufacturer and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) Adverse Experience Reporting Program. \u2022 Recommendations for vaccination protocols should be determined within a veterinarian-client-patient relationship rather than by non-veterinarians such as within boarding facilities.",

No new non-domestic animals are to be bred, imported, kept, displayed or used in any way. For those animals already in circuses, provision must be made for them to live out their lives in an appropriate environment retired from circus performance so as to maintain established strong bonds with their human carers. Removing them totally may adversely affect their welfare; however, regular welfare assessments should be performed to determine their status. 2. All circus animals need to perform or be exercised daily (e.g. training or other activities). 3. Standards of health, welfare, nutrition, housing, confinement, transport and handling are to be not less than those that are described, legislated or enforced for similar domestic animals used or kept in our society. 4. Environmental enrichment is an essential consideration for circus animals within the limitations of an itinerant lifestyle. 5. Licences to use or display animals in circuses should be underpinned by a clear, unambiguous, enforceable National Code of Practice or Standard. Alternatively, an auditable, accountable and prescribed quality assurance system is required. Although veterinary advice may be sought from local veterinarians in emergency situations, circuses should retain veterinarians with relevant expertise, especially in relation to non-domestic animals. These veterinarians should act as professional advisers, be involved in regular health assessments of the animals and be available for telephone consultations with local veterinarians.",
