Therefore the small advance of the measures in Germany leads to a rise of the expected registered infection by a factor of 4-5 if the same measures are applied from now. viii) Delays in implementation lead to a significant increase in the maximum number of infections. This increase corresponds approximately to the current new infection rate in the US (approx. 34%), applied to the maximum number of infections that occur. This means that a maximum of 1 million infected people will rise to 1.34 million infected people if the consistent implementation of the measures is delayed by one day.

The basic principles of the growth curve of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be visualized with the simplest possible modeling. In addition, the essential key points of the simulation result should be made clear, namely the effectiveness of the measure in relation to the start time and the possible achievable reduction of the infected. The basis is therefore not the basic number of reproductions but the current daily rise of registered infections (in short: infection rate). The actual infection rate is calculated by averaging the growth of the observed new infections per day for a period of the last 10 days. In contrast to the basic reproductive rate, the infection rate can be read directly from the published figures for Covid-19. It was about 30% in Germany until March 21, 2020, averaged over the increase in new infections since March 1, 2020 but started to reduce significantly from March 21 to a value between 15-20 % for the last days [4] . This clear reduction is a very promising observation regarding the forthcoming spread as it will be pointed out in the following.",

The model does not take into account quarantine. The registered infected people are considered to contribute to the further infections. In act one could suppose that it is right opposite because these people are in quarantine, but due to the number of unreported cases it can be assumed that their number is proportional to the infected people who are not in quarantine actually. So they form a representative number that contributes to further growth of infections via the infection rate k. Fig. 1 shows the course of I (n) according to the given equation for Germany as expected active infections to be in the range from March 15 to April 30 for various infection rates k, possibly resulting from social distancing. An initial conservative infection rate of 31% was summed according to the data presented in [16] . It should be noted that the values reported are always subject to statistical fluctuations and therefore do not correspond exactly to the \"real\" daily values but need to be averaged over a certain time span. The simulation result shows the following properties of the calculated course: i) Without measures, an exponential increase in new infections continues until natural restrictions curb the further spread of the virus which will possibly occur after passing 10 million infections (in Fig.  1 and Fig. 2 an apparent linear increase as a logarithmic representation, linear representation see Fig. 3 ). ii)",
