Since its first description for intrathoracic lesions, needle aspiration has become a mainstay in the diagnosis of respiratory tract disease. In the early 1900s, Papanicolaou developed cytological techniques for diagnostic purposes. Originally it was a means of identifying the causative agents in a range of infective and inflammatory conditions including tuberculosis but by the 1930s establishing itself as a method for diagnosing lung cancer. Sputum was the main source of material early on, but methods have now moved with progress in sampling techniques from rigid bronchoscopy through to fiber-optic bronchoscopy to the recently introduced method of endoscopic (bronchoscopic) ultrasound-guided sampling \u2013 mainly by fine needle aspiration. That said, more traditional methods, such as examination of sputum, are still employed (see Table 3.1).\n",

With regard to respiratory tract samples, there are only a few instances where deviation from these procedures should be considered. The first is when the sample is bloody or mucoid as these alterations might interfere with the interpretation (mainly by obscuring the lesional cells). For bloody samples, acetic acid pretreatment can lyse the red blood cells. Some liquid-based media contain red cell lysing agents. The Lymphoprep gradient technique is also useful. Mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine or Mucolex can be used to remove or liquefy unwanted mucus, and again some liquid-based media already contain their own mucolytic agents, just as some staining techniques include a liquefying step in their preparation, e.g., Saccomanno technique (see below).",

Often the specimen will arrive in the laboratory as a liquid, either due to the nature of the material, or because the material has been introduced into transport medium.

In general, sputum should contain alveolar macrophages to ensure lower respiratory tract sampling, often with columnar cells (which may be from the upper or lower tract). However, saliva may contain tumor cells, and these should of course be reported as such. The main problem with unsuitable samples is that the lesional cells may be absent or obscured by food or other oral material. Blood may be a problem or problematic if it hides the other cellular material, and clearly the cellularity and state of fixation should be satisfactory without the confusion of degenerative changes. BAL samples should optimally be free from upper tract contamination.",

It can be collected very easily, and with it are entrapped cells that are either shed from the surface of the underlying tissue or expelled to perform an immune function. Examination of sputum has the advantages of being cheap, quick, noninvasive, and easily repeatable. Sputum cytology has been used for both screening and diagnostic purposes to reasonable effect but is being superseded by fiber-optic bronchoscopy specimens because these are more sensitive with the advantages of being able to localize the abnormality and allow sampling under direct vision for cytology and histology. Nevertheless there is still a role for sputum cytology in the diagnosis of lung cancer with reported sensitivities of around 42 % for one specimen, 82 % for three consecutive specimens, and 91 % for five daily specimens. It has also been suggested that post-bronchoscopy sputum samples may be useful when the bronchoscopy samples are nondiagnostic. The false positive rate lies somewhere between 2.7 and 4.8 %.",

For this, the material is prefixed and concentrated in 50 % alcohol. This is followed by centrifuging or filtering to form a pellet. The diagnostic accuracy is said to be better than the traditional method, and obviously a cell block can be made very easily if required. The material can also be liquefied and concentrated to increase cell yield, but cell preservation suffers and the cell presentation is therefore poorer.

Squamous epithelium here is identical to that found elsewhere although it is rarely keratinizing. It is composed of stratified layers of cells including a proliferating basal layer through a parabasal zone to the more superior intermediate and superficial layers. Respiratory epithelium on the other hand is pseudostratified and columnar, meaning that all of the cells lie individually along the basement membrane. Different heights of cells and their nuclei or different positions of their nuclei give the impression of layering. These cells have surface cilia embedded in a terminal end plate or bar which beat and provide an \u201cescalator\u201d by which mucus is transported proximally for expulsion. Interspersed with the respiratory cells are mucin-secreting goblet cells and scattered neuroendocrine cells (also known as Kulchitsky cells). Goblet cells are present in a ratio of about 1:5 with the epithelial cells, but their number is increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This epithelium lines all of the conducting parts of the tract to the terminal bronchioles. From here to the alveoli, a flatter-unilayered configuration of epithelial cells allows gas exchange with the blood in the capillaries. Here there are type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes (the latter being the progenitors of the former) and another population of neuroendocrine cells, the Clara cells.",

Bronchial cell hyperplasia often presents as sheets of actively regenerating cuboidal and columnar cells which retain their cilia (Fig. 3.13). The nuclear chromatin is not altered however, a useful feature when trying to differentiate with a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Occasionally, these hyperplastic changes can lead to the formation of structured curled up strips of epithelium called Creola bodies which are particularly seen in asthmatics, and these may cause confusion with adenocarcinoma. However, the epithelial cells within Creola bodies lack macronucleoli and may retain their surface cilia (Fig. 3.14). In asthma and other chronic obstructive lung disease, the goblet cells may be also be hyperplastic. Reserve cell hyperplasia is also frequently seen as a response to any local insult. These reserve calls are arranged in groups and are small columnar or cuboidal cells with a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. They may show molding, but their nuclei are always regular, and there is no associated necrosis. Type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia follows injury to the more distal epithelial cells lining the alveolar walls. These are seen as grouped or individual polygonal or rectangular cells with small nucleoli, no cilia, and sometimes cytoplasmic vacuolation.\n\n",

The nucleus looks empty (Fig. 3.22) and classically appears to have a ground glass appearance and Cowdry A inclusions. These are triangular or wedge-shaped intranuclear structures that are refractile. The background is usually clean. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causing chicken pox will have a virtually identical appearance. Measles though is different and typically produces numerous nuclei in epithelial cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilia. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also shows multinucleation with basophilic inclusions. Adenovirus is difficult to diagnose but may be recognized by radiating nuclear chromatin and a rosette arrangement. Small eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions may be visible. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may be found in macrophages and other cells, with their characteristic halos and owl eye inclusions (Fig. 3.23). The ease with which inclusions are found correlates with the severity of the infection. A consistent feature of viral diseases of the respiratory tract is ciliocytophthoria. The main differential diagnosis is with adenocarcinoma. The latter often produces sheets or aggregates of cells, while virally infected cells usually present as single cells. Critical examination of the nuclear content for inclusions, loss of chromatin, and multinucleation will point toward viral disease rather than cancer.

It was previously thought to be a protozoan organism but for many years now has been classified as a fungus. It is found worldwide in the soil and atmosphere. It is most notorious for infecting those with HIV (AIDS) and after transplantation. It lives as a 1\u20135-\u03bcm trophozoite that adheres to type 1 pneumocytes by filopodia. The trophozoites develop into cysts 5\u20138 \u03bcm in diameter which show a focal thickening of the capsule and contain merozoites. The cyst form contains sporozoites. The cysts autofluoresce with Papanicolaou and can be identified with the aid of toluidine blue, Giemsa, Gram-Weigert, PAS, and silver stains (Fig. 3.27). The best sample for detection is BAL, but sputum may reveal the organism, especially in an induced sputum sample. Typically there are alveolar granular casts with a honeycomb appearance (Fig. 3.28). When treated or punctured, the cysts collapse and form crescent-shaped structures. The number of cysts is related to severity of infection. PCR can be performed as an additional or alternative method of confirmation. It should be remembered that in the setting of immunocompromise, PCP may occur with other coexistent infections, especially CMV (Fig. 3.29).\n\n\n",

Histoplasma capsulatum has a refractile capsule, is an obligatory pathogen, and requires macrophage ingestion. Other similar fungi with which it may be confused include Blastomyces and Cryptococcus, and of course Candida. Cryptococcus is found worldwide and measures 5\u201320 \u03bcm.

The fungus is round with a clear but thick mucopolysaccharide capsule that is reasonably easily identified on Papanicolaou but better appreciated on PAS, mucicarmine, or Grocott stains. Healthy individuals may be exposed to this fungus but mount an immunological response that is able to combat and either destroy the organism or contain it within the lung. However, reinfection may occur, or the fungus can lie dormant before reactivating later in life and spreading through the lungs.

Viral pneumonitis often needs to be considered in the differential. It has been shown that functional changes in the BAL lymphocytes can be shown by more sophisticated analysis, often before morphological changes are seen histologically. These studies point to the important role of activated, alloreactive, and donor-specific lymphocytes in acute and chronic lung rejection.

Atypical squamous metaplasia (squamous cell dysplasia) will not provoke the same aggressive management route as a squamous cell carcinoma and should not be over interpreted. These lesions tend to have a clean background and are often single celled and not as bizarre as true invasive tumors. Nucleolar prominence is said to be good indicator of invasive malignancy. Occasionally, one may have difficulty in differentiating genuine squamous cancer cells from oral cavity contaminants (especially vegetable cells), oral lesions such as parakeratosis, tracheostomy-related atypia, the so-called Pap cells of laryngitis which have very dark nuclei but regular nuclear outlines, degenerate columnar cells, and epithelial cell atypia associated with severe infections that cavitate, chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis, previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy, bronchiectasis, a mycetoma, viral infections such as HSV and changes associated with infarcts/pulmonary emboli. Sometimes there may be evident squamous metaplasia or dysplasia overlying a different type of tumor, and a mistaken report leads to inappropriate management decisions. In FNA samples, it is also possible to misinterpret a granulomatous picture for squamous cell carcinoma. With reparative changes, there is often a lack of single cells, the cells have abundant cytoplasm, and there is a low nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Of course, all of these changes may be present as well as the tumor, and this adds a further dimension to the diagnostic difficulty.",

There is continued debate as to whether carcinoid tumors and small cell carcinomas arise from the same pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. There is good evidence that they do not as they show differing locations and TTF1 staining. There are several types of neuroendocrine cell within the lungs that are part of the APUD system, and these are chromaffin, argentaffin, and/or argyrophil. Kulchitsky cells lie in the central airways between respiratory epithelial cells and goblet cells. Clara cells are located in the peripheral lung parenchyma admixed with the pneumocytes lining the alveoli. Both are characterized by cytoplasmic neurosecretory granules; these are membrane-bound dense-core secretory granules that are between 50 and 500 nm in diameter. When the cells are not lying individually, they all tend to form organoid structures such as nests, alveoli, festoons, or ribbons.

As a rule, the cells are either single or arranged in small acini, but rarely there may be palisading or a trabecular pattern. The individual cells are often plasmacytoid, cuboidal cells which are extremely uniform and well preserved unlike the fragile cells of a small cell carcinoma. The nuclei are round or oval, and the nuclear content has the characteristic \u201csalt-and-pepper\u201d or stippled pattern of chromatin with inconspicuous nucleoli which typifies these tumors. The nuclear membrane is smooth and regular, but the cell borders are poorly defined. There may be nuclear molding, and very occasional mitoses may be present (see below). Cytoplasm is absent or limited, and often the nuclei are bare. Necrosis is absent. A capillary network may be visible, and in FNA samples, a perivascular arrangement of tumor cells may be appreciated. Atypical carcinoid tumors comprise less than 10 % of pulmonary carcinoids and the diagnostic features of these tumors, namely, areas of necrosis, and a mitotic count between 2 and 10/2 mm2 requires histological assessment which cannot be reliably determined on cytology. It may be difficult to differentiate atypical carcinoid tumors from either the classical variant or small cell carcinoma. Carcinoid tumors in general may show similar features to sclerosing hemangiomas (see later). Immunohistochemistry may be useful in some cases utilizing chromogranin A, TTF1, and Ki67. Carcinoid tumors are positive for chromogranin A and a minority express TTF1. Sclerosing hemangiomas express TTF1 but not chromogranin.

There have been several classifications over the years with the WHO system currently accepted by many (WHO classification of lung and thymic tumors). This distinguishes between type A, AB, B, and C thymomas with B separated into 1, 2, and 3 and C representing thymic carcinoma. This classification offers some indication as to the likely biological behavior and therefore appropriate management. It should be remembered that all thymomas are potentially lethal tumors, and many believe they should be classified in a similar manner to neuroendocrine tumors with type A tumors analogous to carcinoid tumors representing the well-differentiated end of the spectrum and type C thymomas representing high-grade carcinomas. Some have suggested that those tumors with \u201cmedullary\u201d epithelial cell predominance behave in an indolent manner and those with a predominance of cortical epithelial cells are more likely to invade and metastasize. Staging is generally more useful for prognostication and is based on the Masaoka system although a TNM system is currently being piloted.
