To date, over one million people across the two hundred countries have been infected according to the last updates of the World Health Organization (WHO). Approximately sixty thousand confirmed deaths among the cases are reported [1]. Humanity had not faced a pandemic through the history that spreads rapidly all over the earth. If a defined brand new virus is able to spread from person to person while infecting the contacts easily with a sustained and efficient way, then it is called a pandemic. The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) fulfills all those definitions strongly. At the end of the year 2019, Wuhan city of China cradled the first case of the novel coronavirus. Now from Europe to America, its deadly effects threaten the whole world. The WHO named the 2019-nCoV epidemic disease on February 11, 2020 as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). 2019-nCoV is a new member of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus family (SARS-CoV) and labeled as SARS-CoV-2 [2].",

[3]. For all that, the respiratory symptoms are not in a specific form. There are so many isolated cases i.e. the existence of the COVID-19 may not appear at the first clinical symptoms [4]. The rapid spreading nature of the coronavirus and the serious respiratory effects to humans make the diagnosis of the COVID-19 an urgent situation [5]. Today, health specialists use the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for the detection of the nucleic acid forms stem from the SARS-CoV-2. In the process, the respiratory specimens (such as oropharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal sampling) are collected and the very important issue when doing this is the receipt place of the specimens. The operation is categorically open to malfunctions by the expert mistakes [6]. Besides the operation procedure, the PCR test is a time-consuming process. Because a patient has to be isolated in non-suitable circumstances for hours until getting the test results. In addition, these types of tests have a low detection rate of between 30 \u2013 50%. Hence, most of the times they need to be repeated to make a confirmation [7].",

Because of the fast-spreading essence of the pandemic, patients apply to the health center in batches. At this point, the need for rapid diagnosis methods is a very important issue. For monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infections to diagnose, there is another option of visualization using the radiological images, for instance, chest X-rays or Computed Tomography (CT). Former studies prove that COVID-19 causes abnormalities that are visible in the chest X-rays and CT images, in the form of ground-glass opacities. With a strong suggestion, a diagnostic with radiological images could be a first step in monitoring the COVID-19 [9]. Although the radiological images based diagnostic is a faster way and also it has some advances over the PCR testing in terms of the detection rate in earlier stages of the COVID-19, the backbone of the system is the need of experts in comprehending the images. Intrinsically, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based diagnostic options can encourage the experts to gain a rapid and accurate explication over the X-ray images on the way of the detection of the COVID-19 [10].",

In [15], the authors propose a transfer learning model that processes a dataset including the CT images of the COVID-19 infected patients. They obtain a test accuracy of 79.3%. The study [14] indicates a three-class model that can distinguish the COVID-19, Influenza-A viral-based pneumonia, and healthy cases. The segmentation-based study reaches the 86.7% accuracy value with the CT images dataset. In [13], the authors propose a rapid AI development cycle using a deep learning-based CT image analysis. Heretofore, the mentioned studies in the literature use non-public datasets through developing a deep learning-based diagnostic of the COVID-19. The studies [11], [12] provides public datasets including the COVID-19 X-ray images of infected patients. In [11], the authors propose a combined public dataset besides a deep learning model called COVID-Net for the detection of COVID-19. COVID-Net architecture relies on a tailored Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model which uses the chest X-rays as inputs. The authors reach a test accuracy of 92.4% with restricted COVID-19 class images. In our study, we use the same dataset of the [11] to be able to outperform the existing COVID-Net accuracy in detecting the COVID-19. In addition, there are several more studies that we can consider in COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays [16], [17], [18], [19]. With a detailed pre-processed dataset, our study captures the flag with a specially designed deep learning model.",

With a view to obtain a higher accuracy rate, the hyper-parameter optimization of the deep learning models is a crucial task [27]. The backbone of the proposed model i.e. the dataset is a public dataset that is detailed in [11]. Differently from the study [11], we perform a multi-scale augmentation process to overcome the imbalance problem of the proposed public dataset. Since the focus is on COVID-19 diagnosis, we perform a detailed offline augmentation process for the limited number of COVID-19 infected chest X-rays of the patients. With the help of the offline well-defined augmentation process and Bayes-SqueezeNet, our proposed diagnostic model for COVID-19 outperforms the COVID-Net [11] while reaching a test accuracy of 0.983. In building our model, we first perform a detailed augmentation. After obtaining the augmented dataset, the data split is generated on the shuffled database to form the train, validation and test datasets. We manage the training process of the deep SqueezeNet while performing a Bayes optimization with the validation phase at the same time. Through the training, the best model is determined and the final network design is tested with the separate test dataset package. On through those developments, the proposed deep Bayes \u2013 SqueezeNet obtains a higher detection rate in the diagnosis of the COVID-19 using the chest X-ray images.",

The test set is used for the testing input. In the training and optimization stage, the SqueezeNet convolution network is utilized and it uses the squeeze and expands layers of the fire modules to construct a smaller and more effective CNN architecture. SqueezeNet is a pre-trained CNN model and it is pre-trained on the ILSVRC-12 challenge ImageNet dataset [30], [31]. This supporting dataset is completely different from X-ray images and the SqueezeNet model needs to be fine-tuned to classify the COVIDx classes. In order to obtain the best decision-making model, the CNN network is optimized with the Bayesian-based method, which is a sequential design strategy, during training. A validation error is used to update the optimization process. Finally, the best SqueezeNet model is obtained and used for the decision-making process with the test set.

Convolution layer convolutes between the weights and small regions in the input volumes, with 3\u00d73 kernels. Each convolution layer performs an element-wise activation function as the positive part of its argument. SqueezeNet utilizes from the fire layers, which constructed of squeeze and expansion phases, between the convolution layers. The output tensor scale and input of the fire are consistent. The squeeze phase uses the filter of size 1\u00d71, whereas expansion uses the filters of size 1\u00d71 and 3\u00d73. Firstly, the input tensor H\u00d7W\u00d7C passes through the squeeze and the number of convolution is equal to C/4 of the number of input tensor channels. After the first phase, the data passes through the expansions and depth of the data is expanded to C/2 of the output tensor depth. Both squeeze and expansion phases are connected to the ReLu units. The squeeze operation compresses the depth, and expansion increases the depth by keeping the same feature size. Finally, expansion outputs are stacked in the depth dimension of input tensor with concatenate operation. Figure 3\nsummarizes the fire layer and sub-operations.

In general, there exist two ways of hyperparameters optimization called manual and automatic searching. The manual searching as the name suggests looks for the hyperparameters by hand. Hence, manual searching requires expertise. Unfortunately, when dealing with big data and so many model parameters for tuning, even expertise may be insufficient [27], [33]. To handle the difficulties of manually searching, automatic searching alternatives take place in the literature. Grid search and random search algorithms can be considered in this topic. Nevertheless, there are still problems remaining in both methods such as the curse of dimensionality, and unavailability of the highly efficient performance with the time-consuming operations [27], [34].",

Bayesian optimization relies on a typical kind of approximation. Dealing with an unknown function requires an approximation with the help of some known samples i.e. prior knowledge. It is like the concept of the posteriori probability. Here, the food of the algorithm is observations generated by the model evaluations in which the outputs of the online learning.

However, RT-PCR testing has a long time complex process and it is very troublesome [6]. Another detection method is chest radiography imaging due to the abnormalities in chest X-ray images of patients infected with COVID-19 [2], [11]. Therefore, we have selected a distinctive and public dataset including chest X-ray images to respond to the need for a rapid disease diagnosis system [11]. In order to compose a special COVID-19 dataset, two different publicly available datasets were combined as COVID chest X-ray dataset [12] and Kaggle chest X-ray pneumonia dataset [38]. The obtained COVIDx dataset [11] consists of a total of 5949 posteroanterior chest radiography images for 2839 patient cases. The dataset includes 1583 normal, 4290 pneumonia and 76 COVID-19 infection cases. In the pneumonia samples, diseases were caused by none-COVID-19 viral and bacterial effects. Considering the number of cases, there are a total of 1203 uninfected normal patients, 1591 pneumonia cases with none-COVID-19 and 45 COVID-19 patient cases. The dataset includes three classes and Figure 4\nshows a batch of images that are randomly selected from class samples. The images are transformed to RGB with 8-bit depth and have variable pixel-based resolution values.",

According to the heat maps of the images, the trained network distinguishes the classes with an acceptable feature mapping. To form an outlier example, Figure 11 (d) presents a misclassified class sample i.e. Normal class is confused with Pneumonia. The probability values are 0.25 and 0.74, for Normal and Pneumonia respectively.Fig 12.\n",

Considering AI, CNN methods achieve better and faster results compared to the traditional diagnosis methods. In this paper, a rapid robust and efficient COVID-19 diagnosis method, which is namely deep Bayes-SqueezeNet, is proposed.

Some limitations of the RT-PCR nucleic acid-based test modules reveal a need for fast alternative methods to be able to serve the front-line experts to make them reach a quick and accurate diagnosis. In this study, we propose an AI-based decision-making system including the recognition of input X-ray images under the roof of a very practical deep learning model. This study is an important attempt including an easy to implement deep learning model which has an accuracy performance of 98.3% (among Normal, Pneumonia and Covid cases), and 100% for the single recognition of COVID-19 (among other classes). In these difficult days of the global COVID-19 pandemic, our model has a strong potential to build a tool design for COVID-19 monitoring. We would like to note that that the RT-PCR test method to detect the SARS-CoV-2 is still important. However, it is proved that there are also undeniable shortcomings along with the RT-PCR test method, which can be listed as follows: 1) its possible methodology lacks, 2) strict dependence on the level of the disease (timing), 3) the possibility for collecting the specimens in mistaken localizations and 4) its response time delay [6], [7]. In our model working with a deep learning-based practical structure, the early stage detections of the COVID-19 cases could be done to manage and control the pandemic disease. In medical image processing, while deep learning methods are preferred in many areas, it is becoming more and more important especially in the interpretation of radiological images. As such, our model, which is extremely satisfactory even with its initial results, opens the door for the implementation of a comprehensive product that can work mobile and appeal to the end-user.",

With its practical structure and generalization performance, the SqueezeNet is preferable in the embedded applications. We improve the SqueezeNet structure with Bayes optimization algorithm to build a robust and sustainable learning model. Bayesian optimization helps us to build a best-performed model with a validation dataset. The diagnosis system is trained using the public dataset proposed in [11] with its augmented form. A separate test, which is independent of train and validation sets, performs the experiments. Our experimental results also present the performance boosting of the augmentation contribution to the dataset pre-processing. Thus, model training can be performed with a rich image set of X-rays of COVID-19. After comprehensive literature research, the up to date studies, which use the same or similar public datasets are detected and we evaluate our model with those. The proposed diagnosis model for COVID-19 using the X-ray images, the deep Bayes-SqueezeNet outperforms its competitors.
