A quick screening of the scientific literature available on the mentioned COVID-19 platforms shows that the vast majority of articles deal with the technical analysis of the characteristics of the new virus, the challenges in identifying appropriate treatment, in clarifying infection transmission modalities (from asymptomatic individuals for example), while only few address the many practical and psychological challenges for the first \u201crescuers\u201d that are represented by the medical and hospital personnel in general (Liu et al. 2020; Zhang 2020). Few address the issue of psychological effects of the required quarantine (Brooks et al. 2020), which became a very relevant issue in the pandemic\u2019s unfolding, as it involves millions of people for an unclear period of time. An important distinction that has been made regarding any non-pharmaceutical treatment of the pandemic is between suppression and mitigation measures (Ferguson et al. 16th March 2020). The former corresponds to a lockdown at the regional or country level such as the one initially declared for the Hubei province in China in January and or in Italy on March 8. The latter is a compound of behavioral measures such as hand washing and protective mask wearing, but also selective closure of play grounds, schools and universities, isolation of age groups and individuals more at risk of getting seriously sick and isolation and quarantine for those found positive with symptoms. Now, as the countries that have reached the first peak of the outbreak are taking forward-looking decisions on how to proceed in order not to disrupt the economy even harder and avoid societal breakdown, the focus of research and practice should be on recovery. However, it can be expected that suppression measures will be necessary for a rather long period of time, overlapping with the early recovery phases, to avoid new waves of infection until a safe vaccine will be available in the required quantity, which is expected to be between 12 and 18 months according to Ferguson et al. (2020). While at least 60 laboratories and research centers are currently working on a vaccine, there is no guarantee that an effective one will be actually found at all (Callaway 2020). But even in the case a vaccine will be found, the lock down of entire economies for an unlimited period of time is not an option to be considered under a resilience approach. Massaro et al. (2018) show convincingly that there is a critical threshold at which the risk of infections is decreasing to a desirable level beyond which the societal and economic costs are such that the \u201cdeterioration of systems functionality\u201d is unbearable. Resilience management requires instead to \u201cevaluate cross-domain alternatives to identify a policy design that enhances the system\u2019s ability to (i) plan for such adverse events, (ii) absorb stress, (iii) recover, and (iv) predict and prepare for future stressors through necessary adaptation\u201d.",

Researchers continue to strive for a full understanding of the conditions and nature of the decisions and actions that drive communities either to a successful or, instead, to an unsuccessful recovery and thus to an unsuccessful reconstruction (Chang and Olschansky 2009). Recovery is often characterized by a considerable uncertainty as to how to manage a very large number of problems, while lifting some of the exceptional instruments and extraordinary power that are associated with the state of emergency. As for the current crisis, whilst we were not really able to learn from each other and coordinate for the emergency, we can still try doing this for the recovery, at least putting in place tracking and surveillance mechanisms in a more harmonized fashion and also learn from each other regarding what does and what does not lead to a lead to a successful recovery of society and ways of life.",

Reports depicting what a likely impact of a widespread coronavirus infection could look like and corresponding countermeasures were previously available in newspapers and regional and national risk assessments in various countries.2 Yet this phenomenon of unheard warnings is not new in the field of natural and man-made hazards. One year before Hurricane Katrina provoked one of the largest disasters in the history of the U.S., a scenario exercise was conducted to respond to a simulated hurricane named Pam (Griffin 2007). The exercise elicited many weaknesses and gaps in the preparedness of key organizations, yet little was done to fix them ahead of the incident. We know from other hazard fields that organizations are often reluctant to prepare for extreme or what may look like worst case scenarios as they do not really want to face their own vulnerabilities. Such reluctancy is often hidden behind arguments related to the need to act, based solely on scientific scenarios, to events that are otherwise framed within administrative procedures and bureaucratic approval processes. Any new input is regarded with suspect as it is perceived by involved officials as frustrating their already conducted efforts to plan and prepare. In complete contrast to this, the scenario approach can however be a mean to test and stress organizational response capacity without having to pay the real costs that are entailed by failures and mistakes made in real circumstances, as correctly put by Lagadec (1995).",

Some initial lessons can however be already learned from the first emergency period as experienced in the last few weeks that should be leveraged on to proceed with the urgently needed recovery. In any such early crises medical advisors are asked to provide recommendations \u201con the fly\u201d, based on what becomes new or updated information (Zhang et al. 2020). This provides a typical case where a Bayesian type of hazard and risk assessment approach is essential, i.e., a decision-making process being able to assess new information whenever it becomes available (Guagenti and Petrini 2017). The uncertainties involved in such estimates (Viceconte and Petrosillo 2020) are not different from other natural or man-made hazards, e.g., terror- and crime fighting situations, volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, albeit less \u201cglobal\u201d. In highly uncertain conditions, preventative measures are neither easy to decide nor to communicate. And discussions about such measures are difficult not only with the public but also (mainly) between scientists and decision makers who are not experts in the field of medicine at the offset of a crisis.",

Between hand washing, closure strategies and the development of an effective vaccine and treatment that were considered in the early phases of the COVID-19 crisis, there is a wide margin of options that could be and were undertaken by different countries in an uncoordinated fashion. Often so, there seems to be little room for responses which are not on the opposite side of the scale, i.e., which are not only total closure or business as usual. Although more fine-tuned measures are probably harder to implement, they become essential in the recovery phase entirely in the spirit of the statement made by Vale and Campanella (2005): \"We may all be made to survive [author's note: with extreme suppression measures], but it takes intelligence and competence to survive well [with graded measures]\".",

This is a capacity that contrasts with the legal consequences that may be brought later by the same scientists, so sometimes going for caution is a way of escaping future charges. Something that in the more recent decades has become a real issue (Lauta 2016; Benessia and De Marchi 2016). The position of scientists as public advisors and advisors for decision makers has been the object of many studies, related for example to decisions regarding whether to evacuate or not in the face of premonitory signals of a volcanic eruption (Bretton et al. 2015). The finding is that even in \u2018early stage\u2019 societal risk governance environment, we need outcome-focused \u2018operational forecasting\u2019 (Marzocchi et al. 2012)\u2014not only with regard to spatial and physical parameters of the hazard but including the interaction with civil protection authorities and at-risk communities.",

Such complexity cannot be treated only as a medical affair or as a civil defense problem. Decisions must be clear and coherent, but perhaps better based on information and understanding of the multiple aspects entailed by the crisis environment. A more comprehensive understanding of the medical challenges within a risk management perspective might prove more effective, which implies inviting to the consultancy table a larger variety of experts, including economists, researchers in the risk domain, practitioners and academics, with the mandate to make their knowledge and analytical efforts converge on the framing of both the problems and the solutions. In fact, what should be asked from advisors is not an expert opinion but a truly interdisciplinary effort to develop likely scenarios that will take into consideration the multiple aspects of the hazard (the virus spread), exposure (the various situations and places of high concentration of people), vulnerability (physical and systemic, such as social and economic). Scenarios should be based not on the specific specialties of individual advisors (or not only) but on the capacity to synthetize in a very short time the body of knowledge useful to the case that has been produced in each discipline and in coordination with other disciplines. In addition to scientists and experts, representatives of relevant sections of society, including trade union organizations, representatives of school teachers and university deans, and the business community should be involved in the decision-making process. \"Experts\" are undoubtedly knowledgeable about technical and scientific aspects, but not about the choice (Calabresi and Bobbitt 1978), which in risk management implies both facts and closely linked values (Beck 1992).",

The rationale of measures that have been taken by some countries at the beginning of March may help illustrate the contradictions (apparent or real) that must be learned from (and overcome) in the next weeks and months. A legitimate question could have been raised for example regarding the numbers included in different decrees and ordinances: why in France gatherings of more than 5000 (5th March 2020) people were initially prohibited whilst in Switzerland (28th February 2020) the number was dropping to 1000 and in the USA to 10 people (16th March 2020)? Is it a matter of probability? Arguably, from what can be understood from the mathematical and statistical branch of epidemiological studies, the larger the number of potential contacts the faster and more numerous is the progression of the infection in the community. But then why 5000 and not 1000 or 10? Someone should have clearly explained that this was a purely political decision with no ground in epidemiological studies. Or perhaps not? Certainly, the discrepancy between those numbers raises logical questions in the public. The same goes with the reasoning behind initial attempts to contain the infection. Authorities, based on biomedical and epidemiological studies, should have explained why it made sense to circumscribe zones inside a country (Hubei, 23th January 2020, some municipalities in the Lombardia Region, 22nd February) if the virus has already been circulating around the world since December 2019 most likely. Also, one may have legitimately asked if those measures made sense in a community where a large number of cases with symptoms is backed by an equally large or even much larger number of infected people that do not display symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.",

The lack of good quality data on post disaster damage and losses for example is a crucial problem that hampers not only the prioritization of needs for the recovery, but also the capacity to learn from the disaster, to ameliorate risk assessment models based on evidence and empirical observation of real events (De Groeve et al. 2013; Mar\u00edn Ferrer et al. 2016). Although banal for disaster scientists, it must be reminded to experts in other fields, that real events represent scenarios, instances from the wide range of possibilities that can be envisaged. Whilst learning should not be limited to the scenario that has just occurred, failing to do so implies a missed opportunity to widen our knowledge and understanding of implied hazards and risks. As a key component of resilience, the capacity to adapt to a changing environment must be nurtured by data, information and knowledge that can be capitalized on in each event, near miss failure or exercises.",

As shown in the upper part of the framework international organizations, national and regional governments, local administrations should coordinate to assess the dynamic evolution of risk on the basis of a continuous monitoring mechanism. On the one hand the latter is connected to the lessons learned from the early stages of the emergency and throughout the process of acquiring new information and improved understanding of both the virus spread mechanism and the intrinsic vulnerability of different population groups. On the other hand, such mechanism should be fed by a constant flow of information and data that must be collected according to predefined and carefully selected protocols and filtrated through lenses and criteria that derive from what we know and learn on both the pandemic trend and on the effectiveness of the measures. The effectiveness of measures should be measured not only with respect to the fundamental criteria of keeping the infection at a manageable level but also on the equally important basis of their capacity to allow people to work and carry out activities considering also environmental conditions such as summer heat. Interpretation of data, monitoring and learning are all necessary to support an adaptive management of measures aimed at contrasting the spread of the virus above the sustainable threshold for the health care system. Changes and constant improvement of measures should consider also practices that proved to be effective elsewhere. One important aspect of the framework relates to the spatial and temporal scales at which both monitoring and adaptive management of measures have to be considered. Until now, only national level has been considered in terms of measures\u2019 effectiveness (Flaxman et al. 2020) whilst what is proposed here is an integrated management across levels, from the household to individual businesses to municipal and upward to the regional and national level. Surveillance mechanisms should be developed accordingly, permitting a monitoring of the infection level at a community level rather than regional or national only.",

            "text": "Another important point that puzzles public opinion descends from the difficulties in balancing costs and benefits of restrictions imposed to mitigate the infection spread. In fact, in conditions in which uncertainties and stakes are both high such balance is an extremely sophisticated and complex exercise (Ravetz and Funtowicz 1999). We know this from hundreds of cases in the past in various risk situations and in the face of a multitude of threats to the well-being and security of communities. Uncertainties and stakes unfortunately weigh on both sides of the balance, on both cost and benefit estimation. As for the costs, despite current forecasts of the losses that may be incurred at the global level by economies provided by even eminent organizations (UNCTAD 2020), as researchers in the field we can say that there are significant constraints to the forecasting capacity of underlying models. First because the direct \u201cphysical\u201d harm that is generally considered the first link in the cascading effects chain is not likely to be that evident or concentrated in this case. Overall, direct physical damage is what we are best at assessing both pre-end post event. Here the so called \u201cindirect\u201d effects due to the measures put in place to mitigate and/or suppress the spread of the contagion are much more likely to be disruptive and significant. But how bad such effects can be exactly experts cannot really tell. In fact, there is no generally accepted, consistent methodology for estimating the economic impacts of pandemics (Madhav 2017). For example, the majority of models that economists use are designed to depict systems, supply chains under ordinary conditions or under stress that is not single, sudden and rapid onset. How the present crisis will affect the labor market, productivity, etc. are questions difficult to answer, albeit, fundamental to make any real estimate of potential costs of nowadays measures. It must be pointed out also that major public health impacts might be expected as part of indirect and unwanted consequences of the measures. These impacts include pressure and stress on people's mental and general health, exacerbated in contexts where low social protection against unemployment and reduced budget for health care interact through complex loops. Some lessons could be learned from countries that were severely hit by the recent financial crisis (Karanikolos et al. 2013). In a global and networked world, sectors are not only geographically interconnected, but also functionally and systemically. The benefits of the measures are also fraught with uncertainties as briefly discussed above. Therefore, the balance between acceptable costs and reasonably expected benefits is hard to find. There are no exact or optimal solutions here, as only retrospective analysis at the end of the crisis will tell and probably still will be disputable. This explains the large variation of measures between one country and another. Coordination at the international level as called for by many scientists could help, albeit, local application will always require considerations of technical, cultural, social and political feasibility. It may be helpful as well to explain such variations and differences as an inevitable consequence of differences in perspectives, evaluations, and settings. As the crisis is escalating, coordination and collaboration seems much more relevant not only for pandemic management, but also for taking measures and decisions to mitigate the costs of the latter. Collaboration is needed at all scales, ranging from high level head of governments to regional and local level administrations, to share best practices and successful solutions to be experienced during the recovery. One important aspect that has been raised regards the timeliness of action by different organizations. This has been a significant problem in recognizing the threat but also in responding to it and to the challenges different measures imply. As for scientists, researchers in the field of medicine have proved to be fast enough but other fields of studies, including risk management and disaster communities seem to be slower in their reaction, with some exceptions.3 Supra-national coordination institutions have been even slower, with the exception of the World Health Organization (WHO)4 even though fortunately increasingly active in the second stage of the emergency (see for example Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Center of the EU Commission,5 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,6 the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction7).",

In general, however, as outlined above, they lack a systemic perspective, whereas they should become part of a more consistent and comprehensive strategy. The first variable on which to act is time: obviously not every activity and service will be reopened at once. Nevertheless, a clear pathway of reopening should be programmed, also to tailor accordingly measures to sustain those activities that will have to reopen last and perhaps still will suffer significant loss even then (for example tourist activities). Such pathway though should not follow the same logic pursued during the emergency. So not only vital critical necessary activities, but whatever can be reopened safely enough, meaning creating safe distances among customers, users, and workers. The second variable that should be considered relates to the conditions at which each activity and service can be made \u201csafe\u201d in terms of physical distancing. The closure of all but critical activities has been done in some cases (as in Italy) on the basis of statistical classification of activities such as the European NACE. This has created all sort of incongruences and some damage to activities that could have stayed opened if a more fine-tuned classification had been considered. In the recovery there is the need to overcome this rough classification, considering activities on the bases of indicators such as: working conditions, number and concentration of workers and customers in the establishments. For each type of activity some reorganization of work can be defined, such as shifts among workers, allowing them to work partly remotely partly on site, the re-allocation of some equipment and machinery in a way to guarantee the safety distance goal.",

Also in this regard, a careful programming of flexible entry and exit hours can be carried out, which in combination with booking systems can significantly reduce the number of people using public transport at the same time.

Albeit individual social scientists have been interviewed by media it does not really look like eminent risk communication experts have been involved by decision makers, at least not judging from the issued communication. Some lessons learnt have been adopted, for example in many countries only one authority has been appointed to dispatch the numbers regarding victims, those found to be sick and/or positive to tests but with mild or no symptoms. However, building on established lessons requires to have a wide perspective on many issues and dismantle many myths that still persist in governmental agencies in charge for example of civil protection (Drabek 1986).",

Citizens should be regarded as partners, not as recipients of orders. It is also necessary to communicate with different target groups; different demographic groups must be addressed differently, also multilingual information material should be available (Andrulis et al. 2007; Wong and Sam 2010).",

This also is the agreed upon result of several studies, projects, and, good practices (De Marchi 2003; Steelman and McCaffrey 2013, see also the EU funded Horizon 2020 Educen project8). However, such trustfulness must be built before the crisis, during the latter it is harder or even impossible. In contexts where trust and sharing of information is transparent and recognized as such, the provision of information regarding taken decisions must be convincing and based on reasoning and logic. This provision should also consider the inevitable emotional aspects entailed by any emergency condition, not only for the \u201cvictims\u201d but also for the decision makers and their consultants.",

But here lies one of the toughest contradictions, not new though as perfectly expressed long ago in a book chapter by Handmer (1999). Authorities want the public to be aware of the challenges and agree to follow established rules of conducts and what are generally limitations to their freedom and self-determination. However, they refuse to open the entire evidences on which such decisions have been made based on fear of panic and irrational behaviors, thus, showing the same low level of trust in their citizens that the latter display towards them. An important distinction should be made between \u201cpanic\u201d and fear, which is well known in sociology yet not sufficiently acknowledged (Gannt and Gannt 2012). Fear consists in a strong emotional reaction that may be positive because it triggers safeguarding actions (given the information one has). Fear does not necessarily develop into panic, which is negative and to be fought in all possible ways as it paralyzes individuals and impedes them from taking any positive action for their survival. Not letting understandable fear degenerate into panic and anti-social behaviors, which in any case are very uncommon in disasters, depends also on appropriate, consistent, coherent information.",

There is no escape to unveiling the body of knowledge, showing that is robust, significantly larger than any time before in history, and in any case the only relevant ground we have and on the other side to admit the contour of uncertainties and ignorance that lead to given decisions only out of precautionary approach that, though, may prove to be key for saving thousands lives.",

Mitigation measures must be assessed and decided upon based on considerations of effectiveness and cost benefit. Health criteria are key, but they must be balanced against the need to recover in all sectors of human and collective life, to avoid societal and economic breakdown and considering the multiple loops that exist between community well-being and health. Such multiple loops and retroactive feedbacks must be properly addressed in the design of both measures and monitoring protocols to make sure to avoid second and third surges of COVID-19 that are beyond the capacity of the health care system to sustain.",
