Many antigenic types of the causative agent, IB virus (IBV), exist, for example, the Massachusetts, D274, and 4/91 (also known as CR88 and 793/B) serotypes. The Massachusetts type was the first isolated in Europe in the 1940s (Cavanagh and Davis, 1992). The D274 type was the most common in several western European countries in the early and mid-1980s (Cook, 1984; Davelaar et al., 1984; Cavanagh et al., 1992). The 4/91 type was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1990/1991 (Gough et al., 1992; Parsons et al., 1992) but was retrospectively found to have been present in France since 1985 (Cavanagh et al., 1998). Cavanagh et al. (1999) detected the 4/91 type of IBV in swabs, collected in 1997 and 1998, from Saudi Arabia, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Italy, France, and Argentina. Antibodies reactive with the 4/91 type have been detected in chickens in Thailand, Mexico, Greece, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany (Cook et al., 1996).",

There are serious respiratory diseases of unknown etiology that have caused catastrophic economic losses to farmers in the country. There is limited evidence in literature describing the prevalence of poultry respiratory diseases in Jordan. One report (Saad, 2006) describes the serotype of IBV (Massachusetts, Arkansas, Delaware variant 072, and JMK) in poultry flocks in Jordan based on hemagglutination inhibition test and demonstrates the exposure of these flocks to Arkansas, Delaware variant 072, as well as Massachusetts-like serotypes of IBV. Therefore, this study was designed to know which IBV strains were circulating in Jordanian broiler chickens using type-specific reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for Massachusetts, as well as other IBV strains (D274 and 4/91) not previously documented in Jordan.",

Five sterile swabs (Heinz Herenz Medizinalbedarf GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) were taken from 5 chickens from each flock at the acute phase of respiratory disease and sent to the Provimi Jordan laboratory where they were stored at 4\u00b0C until RNA was extracted. Vaccination history included all flocks vaccinated against the M-41 strain of IBV (Intervet, Wim de K\u00f6rverstraat, AN Boxmeer, the Netherlands). In the majority of these flocks, signs of respiratory disease usually appeared at 24 to 31 d of age. Chickens suffered from severe gasping, coughing, conjunctivitis, nasal and ocular discharge, depression, weakness, and were reluctant to move. Gross lesions observed in these flocks included a moderate to severe congestion of trachea with or without mucopurelent exudates, airsaculitis, and pericarditis or perihepatitis.",

Reverse transcription PCR was carried out in a DNA Engine thermal cycler (BioRad Laboratories Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for 1 reverse transcription cycle of 60 min at 45\u00b0C, followed by 94\u00b0C for 5 min, then 40 PCR cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 57\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 90 s, with a final extension cycle at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Reverse transcription PCR produces a 466-bp fragment common to all IBV (Figure 1) that was used in 3 specific nested PCR with oligonucleotide XCE3\u2212, which was designed to hybridize to RNA from all 3 strains, and oligonucleotides MCE1+, DCE1+, and BCE1+ (Table 1) that are specific for types Massachusetts, D274, and 4/91, respectively, and generates 295-, 217-, and 154-bp fragments, respectively (Figure 1). Nested PCR reaction contained 0.5 \u03bcof RT-PCR product of positive reactions, 0.5 \u03bcL of Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/\u03bcL; Promega Corp.), 2 \u03bcof deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (10 mM; Promega Corp.), 5 \u03bcof 10\u00d7 PCR buffer (Promega Corp.), and 1 \u03bcof each of the oligonucleotides MCE1+, DCE1+, and BCE1+ (50 Pmol/\u03bcl; Alpha DNA). A total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcL was obtained by adding nuclease-free water. The nested PCR were performed using the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 48\u00b0C for 2 min, and 72\u00b0C for 90 s, 35 cycles followed by a final extension cycle of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The IBV (M41) antigen [Gezondheidsdienst voor Dieren B.V. (GD), Animal Health Service Deventer, the Netherlands] was used as a positive control for RNA extraction and RT-PCR. Negative control (nuclease-free water) was also used in each run.",

This procedure is time-consuming and requires the use of specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, some isolates could be mixtures of different types of IBV that can confuse the interpretation of serotyping results. Reverse transcription PCR has been described previously using IBV, RNA extracted from allantoic fluid, and tracheal swabs. These techniques had been shown to be very efficient for the detection of IBV and for the identification of IBV types (Cavanagh et al., 1999; Handberg et al., 1999). In this study, we performed RT-PCR on the tracheal swabs from birds with a history of respiratory disease. Furthermore, the RT-PCR-positive reactions were subjected to specific-nested PCR to detect and differentiate strains of the Massachusetts, 4/91, and D274 types. The IBV had been detected in 60% of broiler flocks by RT-PCR. Nested PCR results indicated that the main IBV types circulating in the Jordan broiler population were the Massachusetts type and 4/91 type, which represent 52.4 and 51.4%, respectively, followed by D274, which represents 21% of tested flocks (Table 2). However, because the primers were selected specifically for these 3 types of IBV, other types might have been present but not detected.",

In this study, the sequence of PCR products was not determined, and therefore the origin of the isolates is not clear at present. In conclusion, by utilizing such diagnostic techniques, it is possible to conduct a detailed epidemiological study to determine the full economic effect of this disease. Future work should include the isolation, serotyping, and molecular characterization of IBV in the region to adopt a suitable vaccination program using the common field serotypes as vaccines to protect against IBV-caused disease.",
