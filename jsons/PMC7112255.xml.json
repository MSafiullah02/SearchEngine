Clinically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally considered to be the most sensitive method to detect alterations in the white matter (WM) of MS patients. While the identification of remyelination in such lesions has so far been largely unreliable, advances in multicontrast MRI will increasingly allow for the characterization and monitoring of remyelination in MS patients (Merkler et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The extent of remyelination observed between MS lesions is highly variable. This accompanies significant variations in plaque size with differences in patterns of demyelination and oligodendrocyte damage/loss. This may depend to some degree on the stage of progression of lesions but may also be related to variation in underlying pathogenic mechanisms (Lucchinetti et al., 2000). Generally, the degree of remyelination of MS lesions correlates directly with both numbers of oligodendrocytes (expressing myelin proteins or their mRNAs) and macrophages in lesions (Lucchinetti et al., 1999). Remyelination can occur rapidly and thin, short internodes can be detected in acute lesions within a few weeks of lesion genesis; remyelination can occur concomitant with tissue infiltration by macrophages (Ghatak 1989, Lassmann 1983, Prineas 1984, Prineas 1993) and occasionally myelin destruction (Lassmann 1997, Prineas 1993, Raine 1993). Conversely, some remyelinated lesions can undergo active demyelination (Prineas et al., 1993), resulting in new lesions overlapping remyelinated areas. Shadow plaques are more commonly observed in young patients with an active relapsing\u2010remitting course than in older patients with an inactive/chronic one (Prineas and Connell, 1979); chronic lesions from patients with long\u2010standing disease tend to show sparse remyelination, restricted to a thin rim\u2010bordering periplaque white matter (PPWM). Additionally, remyelination may be sparse in cases of primary progressive MS (Lassmann et al., 1997).",

It has conventionally been assumed that remyelinating Schwann cells originate from Schwann cells associated with spinal roots or nerves supplying the vasculature or meninges (Franklin and Blakemore, 1993). Schwann cell remyelination is generally prominent in areas of both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte loss, leading to the suggestion that death of astrocytes constituting the glia limitans allows Schwann cell entry into the CNS; reorganization of this structure would inhibit further influx. Challenging these views, a report suggests instead that remyelinating Schwann cells may be derived from CNS precursors; this awaits formal proof (Blakemore, 2005).",

It is suggested that remyelination is unlikely to play a significant role in early remission (as conduction deficits persist during the early stages of remission), but may be important for later stages of functional recovery (Jones, 1993). Remyelination fails in most lesions in MS and while it is likely that numerous causal factors underlie progressive clinical deterioration in the disease, the inadequacy or failure of remyelination is likely to play a significant contributory role.",

            "text": "Permanent neurological dysfunction observed in MS has traditionally been attributed to demyelination. Recent clinical studies have questioned the validity of this assumption with the growing belief that permanent axon loss is the more likely pathological correlate of irreversible functional deficit (Fig. 2\n). Demyelinated axons may be vulnerable to damage (during the acute phase) and possibly damage plus atrophy (during the chronic phase) of MS (Ferguson 1997, Lovas 2000, Trapp 1998). While the causes for such axonal atrophy are unclear, demyelination may predispose axons to secondary injury by (1) multiple molecular cytotoxicity mechanisms, including ion channel dysfunction and mitochondrial damage, or (2) failure of local target\u2010derived neurotrophic support for myelinating oligodendrocytes. This implies that one of the principal functions of myelin is to protect axons from secondary insult (Rodriguez 2003, Waxman 2006). To date, there is no formal proof that remyelination does prevent axonal atrophy and loss. However, axon loss in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) lesions is greater in demyelinated areas than remyelinated ones (Kornek et al., 2000). In addition, absence of proteolipid protein (PLP), a major myelin protein, results in progressive axonal degeneration in rodents and humans (Garbern 2002, Griffiths 1998, Edgar 2004). Mice lacking cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP), an enzyme expressed by oligodendrocytes, also show severe axonal degeneration with accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This is associated with a significant motor deficit that becomes manifest by about 4 months (Lappe\u2010Siefke et al., 2003). It is not clear how oligodendrocytes maintain axonal integrity. Oligodendroglia express NGF and BDNF, key neurotrophic factors that play a role in the maintenance and survival of neurons. OPCs and differentiated oligodendrocytes can also support neuronal survival through contact\u2010mediated/soluble mechanisms, providing potential mechanisms by which remyelination could prevent neuronal atrophy (Byravan 1994, Wilkins 2001).",

There are many variants but most models consist of immunizing genetically susceptible animals by direct injection of myelin antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein (MAG), PLP, or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Alternatively, T cells sensitized to myelin antigens can be transferred passively to animals (adoptive transfer). EAE lesions display many pathological features of MS lesions in terms of dissemination, demyelination, and infiltration by macrophages and T cells with significant similarities observed between the clinical course of EAE and MS (Kornek 2000, Storch 1998). The extent of axon loss in EAE lesions also correlates with chronic neurological deficit (Papadopoulos et al., 2006). Both acute and chronic forms of the disease can be induced in EAE models, as well as relapsing\u2010remitting and progressive forms (reviewed in Ercolini and Miller, 2006).",

Alternatively, genetic strategies can be used to induce anatomical and lineage\u2010targeted cell depletion using Cre\u2010mediated gene recombination (Antony 2004, Brockschnieder 2004, Buch 2005, Christensen 2005). Each of these models has particular advantages and can mimic specific aspects of MS lesions, but no model is sufficient to mimic the range of pathological presentations of the disease. Immune models are generally considered to mimic the disease process and pathogenesis in MS better than the toxin models (although there is scarce evidence that the triggers for MS are similar to those inducing demyelination in these models). A drawback of immune\u2010mediated demyelination is the difficulty in separating cellular events associated with demyelination from repair mechanisms, as both can occur in parallel. In contrast, demyelination occurs as a single acute episode following toxin injection into the CNS, allowing demyelination to be temporally separated from regenerative events that occur in response to demyelination making toxin models particularly attractive for the study of remyelination biology. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis may be a major cause of pathology in some MS subgroups (Barnett and Prineas, 2004); toxin models causing oligodendrocyte death, and targeted oligodendrocyte depletion models do mimic this aspect of the disease.",

The first is a recruitment phase, where OPCs proliferate in order to populate demyelinated areas. OPCs subsequently differentiate into premyelinating oligodendrocytes which contact demyelinated axons and differentiate into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes that form functional myelin sheaths\u2014this constitutes the differentiation phase. The recruitment and differentiation phases are associated with distinct and timed patterns of expression of molecules, notable among which are a range of growth factors. While newly generated myelin (formed as a result of remyelination) is distinct from normal myelin (formed during development), experimental analyses show some striking similarities in both processes (reviewed in Franklin, 2002). Therefore, remyelination could be considered to be a recapitulation of the developmental myelination process (Franklin and Hinks, 1999), in keeping with the widely prevailing hypothesis that regenerative mechanisms recapitulate developmental events. Despite such demonstrable parallels, it should be kept in mind that developmental myelination occurs in a normal, ordered microenvironment. By contrast, remyelination occurs within a disrupted and pathological microenvironment dominated by macrophages and T cells that contains demyelinated axons within areas of astrocytosis, none of which pertain in development (Franklin, 2002).",

Despite this, the OPCs are relatively quiescent cells that divide infrequently and have slow rates of division (Polito and Reynolds, 2005). In response to demyelination (and other CNS trauma), OPCs undergo a process of activation followed by rapid proliferation. OPC activation is associated with distinctive changes, including morphological alterations, increase in size, and upregulation of the cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, NG2. They also demonstrate increased gene expression for transcription factors associated with developmental myelination. OPCs in WM normally express low levels of the bHLH transcription factor Olig2 and the homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2.2. However, striking increases in the expression of both Olig2 and Nkx2.2 (that is restricted to oligodendrocyte lineage cells) occur within acute demyelinating lesions (Fig. 3E\u2013M) (Fancy et al., 2004). Coexpression of Olig2 and Nkx2.2 in OPCs appears necessary for these cells to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes, so it has been hypothesized that expression of these two molecules constitutes a genetic switch that converts relatively quiescent OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Nkx2.2 levels show a rapid subsequent decrease during differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Therefore, the authors hypothesize that expression patterns of Nkx2.2 and Olig2 could enable a distinction to be made between OPCs actively participating in repair from OPCs that are quiescent. The authors further speculate that such a distinction could enable actively repairing lesions to be distinguished from the ones where remyelination failure has occurred.",

            "text": "Following activation, OPCs undergo rapid proliferation in order to populate demyelinated areas. Several factors have been identified, which alone or in combination can promote OPC proliferation in vivo and in vitro. These include platelet\u2010derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and glial growth factor 2 (GGF2). PDGF and FGF2 receptors are expressed on OPCs during their proliferative response to demyelination (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998). This accompanies increased expression of PDGF and FGF2 in areas of demyelination (Messersmith 2000, Woodruff 2004). PDGF\u2010A knockout mice show significantly reduced numbers of OPCs and oligodendrocytes accompanied by impaired genesis of myelin (Fruttiger et al., 1999). Conversely, PDGF\u2010A overexpression results in significant increases in OPC densities in demyelinating lesions (Woodruff et al., 2004). This study also examined if the increased availability of an OPC mitogen was associated with enhanced remyelination rates in old rats; no significant differences were observed between transgenic and control animals (despite increased OPC numbers in the former). This suggests that the OPC supply within lesions may not be rate limiting during remyelination. A recent study examining roles of individual signaling pathways has demonstrated distinctive roles in vivo for PDGF and FGF2 during remyelination. The authors suggest that PDGFR\u03b1 signaling is likely to mainly regulate OPC proliferation (in response to demyelination), while FGF2 is a predominant inhibitor of OPC differentiation (Murtie et al., 2005). Systemically administered GGF2, a neuregulin expressed by neurons, has also been shown to promote OPC expansion, prevent OPC differentiation, and enhance remyelination of experimental EAE lesions (Marchionni et al., 1999). By contrast, direct administration of GGF into areas of toxin\u2010induced demyelination did not alter the extent of remyelination, suggesting that systemic GGF2 delivery may affect remyelination by altering the immune response rather than by direct effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Penderis et al., 2003b).",

Numerous transcription factors (and their regulatory molecules) mediate developmental myelination including Sox10, bHLH proteins, MyT1, Mash1, and Gtx among others; their roles in remyelination need to be elucidated (reviewed in Franklin, 2002). A key, nonredundant role for the transcription factor Olig1 has been reported in mediating remyelination (Arnett et al., 2004). Repair of toxin\u2010induced demyelinating lesions in both brain and spinal cord was significantly reduced in Olig1 knockout mice compared with controls. Recruitment of OPCs into lesions from knockout mice appeared normal, but these cells failed to differentiate into remyelinating oligodendrocytes. The subcellular localization of Olig1 could be a critical factor mediating differentiation; nuclear Olig1, expressed by OPCs at the margins of MS lesions, was suggested to be associated with cells actively engaged in repair.",

Insulin\u2010like growth factor\u20101(IGF\u20101) is suggested to play a critical role in this process based on studies in transgenic mice overexpressing IGF\u20101 where increases in myelin sheath thickness and numbers of myelinated axons (with increased numbers of oligodendrocytes) are observed; the expression of IGF in MS lesions is also consistent with the notion that this molecule plays a major role in the differentiation phase (Carson 1993, Gveric 1999, Luzi 2004, Ye 1995). Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) inhibits PDGF\u2010 and FGF2\u2010induced OPC proliferation and is suggested to be an important regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation (McKinnon et al., 1993). The observed pattern and timing of expression of both IGF\u20101 and TGF\u03b21 in demyelinating lesions supports the idea that these molecules regulate OPC differentiation during repair (Hinks 1999, Sim 2002). However, directly increasing levels of IGF\u20101 mRNA using adenoviral\u2010mediated gene delivery was not sufficient to increase the extent of oligodendrocyte\u2010mediated remyelination of toxin\u2010induced lesions in old rats compared with young ones (O'Leary et al., 2002).",

Blocking or increasing the firing rates of neurons can respectively inhibit or enhance myelination (Demerens et al., 1996). Oligodendrocytes and OPCs express a range of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, the activation or inhibition of which can alter proliferation and differentiation of these cells and myelination (Gallo et al., 2001). OPCs are also thought to make close contacts with the nodes of Ranvier and synapses (Bergles 2000, Butt 1999) and are therefore well placed anatomically to respond to changes in axonal function in normal and pathological situations. These observations point to a clear link between electrical activity and myelination, but the potential effects of electrical activity and conduction block in demyelinated axons on the proliferation and differentiation of adult OPCs in surrounding tissue have yet to be established. Inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation (like PSA\u2010NCAM, vitronectin, tenascins\u2010R, GGF2, and jagged) are all expressed by axons (reviewed in Coman et al., 2005).

            "text": "Inflammation undoubtedly contributes to the pathogenesis of demyelinating lesions in MS. However, there is considerable evidence to support the view that the inflammatory response provides an important stimulant for remyelination. Remyelination is frequently associated with a prominent inflammatory response in both experimental and MS lesions. Remyelination is also observed to occur most efficiently in early, active lesions where the inflammatory response is robust (Graca 1986, Ludwin 1980, Raine 1993). One study using Affymetrix microarrays to identify changes in gene expression during remyelination indicates that alterations in inflammatory genes represent the most prominent changes, emphasizing the role of the active inflammatory response (Arnett et al., 2003). Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated an impairment of remyelination in the absence of lymphocytes, MHC\u2010II, inflammatory cytokines, and macrophages (Arnett 2001, Arnett 2003, Bieber 2003, Kotter 2001, Kotter 2005, Mason 2001). This is supported by the findings that anti\u2010inflammatory drugs, such as minocycline and corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisone), significantly delay remyelination of toxin\u2010induced demyelinating lesions (Chari 2006a, Li 2005, Triarhou 1986) (Fig. 4\n). Anti\u2010inflammatory agents appear to act mainly by inhibiting OPC differentiation, as colonization of lesions by OPCs was found to be essentially normal in corticosteroid (CS)\u2010treated animals. Such agents do not permanently impair the repair properties of myelinogenic cells as normal levels of remyelination can be found with increased survival times (following treatment withdrawal) (Chari et al., 2006a). While CS administration has numerous known benefits, these findings will have obvious implications for the use of anti\u2010inflammatory therapies in MS and raise the possibility that prolonged anti\u2010inflammatory treatment may predispose to enhanced axon loss in MS lesions (Chari et al., 2006a).",

Macrophages/microglia are suggested to produce molecules such as growth factors that mediate repair either directly or by activation of astrocytes to produce remyelination\u2010associated growth factors. The addition of peritoneal macrophages, in vitro, to fetal neuron glia cocultures increases the synthesis of myelin proteins like MBP, and increases myelin deposition (Loughlin 1997, Nathan 1987). Inflammation can also enhance the survival and migration of transplanted OPCs, in part, due to upregulation of multiple factors implicated in oligodendrocyte development (Setzu 2006, Tourbah 1997). A similar, remyelination\u2010promoting role has been suggested for T cells in demyelinating lesions (Bieber et al., 2003). Macrophages play a major role in myelin debris clearance with the suggestion that OPC maturation can be inhibited by contact with myelin (Miller, 1999). Indeed, introduction of purified myelin into demyelinating lesions in the brainstem causes a significant impairment of remyelination which is attributable to arrested OPC differentiation rather than impaired recruitment (Kotter et al., 2005). This impairment may be due to a physical restriction of contact between myelinating oligodendrocytes and demyelinated axons, or alternatively due to the presence of inhibitory molecules on myelin debris.",

Given the complexity of such regulatory processes and the prominent heterogeneity in pathogenesis and extent of cell survival in MS lesions, it is clear that the success of repair will be influenced by several interdependent variables. These include (1) OPC and oligodendrocyte availability in lesions, (2) astrocyte and macrophage presence in demyelinated areas, (3) the timed and coordinated expression of regulatory molecules, and (4) the ability of axons and OPCs/remyelinating oligodendrocytes to interact in a manner appropriate for successful remyelination to occur. These parameters are further influenced by age (Chari 2003a, Gilson 1993, Sim 2002), sex (Li et al., 2006), and possibly lesion size (Chari and Blakemore, 2002b). Therefore, a single causal factor in remyelination failure appears unlikely and the postulated causes for regenerative failure in MS remain largely speculative. Several issues must be considered.",

            "text": "First, given that OPCs are critical mediators of remyelination, the question of whether these cells are depleted in MS lesions is a crucial but unresolved one. Histopathological studies using markers like O4, NG2, and PDGFR\u03b1 suggest that OPCs are present in chronic MS lesions in the brain and spinal cord in equal/higher numbers than periplaque WM (Chang 2000, Scolding 1998, Wolswijk 1998). Such OPCs were, however, suggested to be relatively quiescent based on the failure to label with a nuclear proliferation antigen (detected by the Ki\u201067 antibody) (Fig. 5\n) and lack of oligodendrocytes in the center of MS lesions. It was suggested that these OPCs may be incapable of differentiation or alternatively that the lesion environment lacked factors to stimulate regenerative mechanisms (or contained factors that inhibited it) (Wolswijk, 1998). One study examining the specific possibility that remyelination fails due to local OPC destruction along with oligodendrocytes demonstrated that chronic lesions from spinal cords of MS patients contained significant numbers of O4 positive, GalC negative OPCs (Wolswijk, 2002). While interpreting such observations, it should be kept in mind that it is currently impossible to distinguish OPCs that survive in lesions from OPCs that colonize lesions from surrounding normal tissue. Therefore, an observed abundance of OPCs in lesions provides few clues as to their potential destruction during early stages of lesion development. This study further reported that with increasing age of subjects and duration of clinical symptoms (1) OPC densities declined significantly, (2) genesis of new oligodendrocytes appeared increasingly impaired, and (3) lesions did not appear to be significantly repopulated by OPCs (Wolswijk, 2002). Another study has reported that NG2 positive cells could not be detected in acute inflammatory lesions (although small numbers of lesions were examined in this study) (Chang et al., 2000). Support for the idea that OPCs could be killed in MS lesions comes from the demonstration that molecules like MOG and GalC (previously considered to be restricted to oligodendrocytes) are also present on OPCs (Li 2002, Shi 1998). Autoimmunity to MOG has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS lesions, so expression of such molecules on OPCs could, in theory, result in OPC destruction. The finding that patients with relapsing\u2010remitting MS synthesize antibodies to the OPC\u2010specific surface glycoprotein AN2 (which is absent in the CSF of patients with inactive disease) (Niehaus et al., 2000) lends support to this idea.",

An influential hypothesis regarding the failure of remyelination in MS has been the exhaustion of the OPC pool, which suggests that OPCs become depleted around lesions following remyelination. However, one study has demonstrated that focal areas of experimental OPC depletion can be fully repopulated by OPCs from surrounding normal tissue, a process that restores OPC densities to normal (Chari and Blakemore, 2002a). This is supported by the finding that repeated episodes of demyelination do not lead to depletion of the OPC pool or an impairment of remyelination (Penderis et al., 2003a). The repopulation of OPC\u2010depleted areas (by OPCs from adjoining, normal tissue) is a slow process [approximately 0.5 mm/week, a rate that declines further with age due to intrinsic changes in OPCs (Chari et al., 2003b)]. On the basis of such observations, it is clear that large areas of demyelination in MS could require several months to become completely repopulated by OPCs (assuming that tissue colonization rates for human OPCs are similar to that of rat OPCs). As acute inflammation appears to provide a major stimulus for OPC recruitment, it has been suggested that the abating of inflammation in demyelinated areas, with time, will reduce the drive for remyelination, thereby causing repair failure. In other words, remyelination failure may occur due to a \u201cTemporal Mismatch\u201d between the presence of a remyelination\u2010promoting environment and the arrival of OPCs in demyelinated areas (Chari 2002a, Chari 2002b). This would imply that a critical time window exists for the interaction of OPCs with demyelinated axons, outside of which the likelihood of successful remyelination will be significantly reduced. This hypothesis could provide an explanation for the finding that remyelination can be prominent at the margins of MS lesions but not the core (i.e., with increasing distance from lesion boundaries). It may also account for the finding that a relatively quiescent OPC population is present in chronic lesions, which does not appear to contribute to remyelination. Another study has suggested that the presence of dysfunctional OPCs may inhibit further colonization of tissue by OPCs from normal tissue (Chari et al., 2003b), which could potentially explain the failure of repopulation of lesions by OPCs from normal WM with disease progression in MS (Wolswijk, 2002).",

Such axons were found to be dystrophic with multiple swellings. The authors concluded that remyelination failure could not be accounted for either by the absence of OPCs or their failure to generate oligodendrocytes, but instead suggested that demyelinated axons were themselves no longer receptive to remyelination (Chang et al., 2002). A recent review suggests that demyelination that induces major alterations in axonal and oligodendroglial signaling events could contribute to remyelination deficits. This may be linked to the reexpression of cell adhesion molecules like PSA\u2010NCAM on demyelinated axons in MS patients (which has an inhibitory effect on remyelination). The authors also speculate that modification of domain\u2010specific aggregations of nodal and perinodal proteins during demyelination (or disruption of axoglial interactions in these domains) could contribute to repair failure (Coman et al., 2005).",

Other reports suggest that reactive astrocytes could be a major source of remyelination mediators in demyelinated areas (Franklin 1991, Frost 2003, Hinks 1999, Redwine 1998). Therefore, the exact roles played by reactive astrocytes during demyelination and repair are currently far from clear.",

Lesions from brains of MS patients contain elevated levels of Notch\u20101 and Jagged\u20101 (John et al., 2002), suggesting the Notch pathway could potentially underlie the limited degree of remyelination observed in MS. More recently, it has been demonstrated that \u03b3 \u2010secretase\u2010mediated inhibition of Notch signaling in oligodendrocytes in mice with EAE could significantly promote remyelination and reduce axonal damage in the CNS. This was accompanied by an enhancement of clinical recovery (Jurynczyk et al., 2005). Other molecules like the neuregulins (a family of ligands that exerts trophic effects on neurons and glia) appear necessary for normal oligodendrocyte development. Astrocyte\u2010derived neuregulin is dramatically reduced in both chronic and active lesions; this reduced expression is also suggested to contribute to the paucity of remyelination in MS lesions (Viehover et al., 2001). It has been demonstrated recently that the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan accumulates in MS lesions and mice with induced EAE. Hyaluronan was found to inhibit remyelination of experimental demyelinating lesions; interestingly, OPCs were found to colonize such lesions but did not appear to mature into myelinating oligodendrocytes in areas of hyaluronan expression (Back et al., 2005). The identification of such molecules in demyelinated areas will aid in defining key therapeutic targets to enhance remyelination clinically.",

Although this is attractive in principle, there are several challenges confronting such a strategy. (1) Given that the regulation of remyelination is a complex, multifactorial process, the identification of relevant molecules to enhance repair will be critical. This is complicated by the considerable redundancy in the regulatory mechanisms that mediate remyelination. (2) The extensive variability observed to occur in MS lesions raises important issues in relation to the nature, timing, and mode of delivery of therapeutic agents for individual patients.

            "text": "The alternative strategy to enhance remyelination is to introduce myelin\u2010forming cells into areas of demyelination. Several cell types (immature and adult) have been identified that achieve extensive remyelination (with restoration of saltatory conduction) in experimental demyelinating lesions and in myelin mutants. These include OPCs, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) as well as various categories of stem cells [like neural stem cells (NSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and bone marrow\u2010derived stem cells (BMSCs)] and their derivatives\u2014these have been the subject of a number of excellent reviews (Dubois\u2010Dalcq 2005, Duncan 2005, Ibrahim 2006, Keirstead 2005, Pluchino 2005, Pluchino 2005, Tepavcevic 2005) (Fig. 7\n). Numerous issues need to be considered when evaluating the clinical feasibility and benefits of cell transplantation\u2010based strategies in MS. These include (1) the possibility that transplanted cells may, in turn, become targets of the demyelinating pathology, (2) the ability of the transplanted population to proliferate and differentiate in sufficient numbers to mediate remyelination (myelination potential, in general, appears to be dependent on the degree of enrichment of immature cells in the cell preparation). ESCs are particularly attractive in this regard due to their capacity for unlimited expansion in vitro, broad differentiation potential (including differentiation into multipotent neural precursors and OPCs), and their amenability to genetic engineering (Keirstead 2005, Nistor 2005). Other studies have shown that supernumerary transplanted OPCs do not survive, proliferate, or migrate in the adult CNS (Franklin 1996, O'Leary 1997) and indicate that considerable depletion of the resident OPC population (>50%) is prerequisite to introducing significant numbers of OPCs into adult CNS tissue (Chari et al., 2006b). This may not represent a problem in lesions where OPC depletion occurs along with oligodendrocyte loss. However, as dysfunctional OPCs appear to inhibit tissue repopulation by new OPCs (Chari et al., 2003b), it remains to be established if transplant\u2010derived OPCs can, in fact, mediate repair of lesions that contain significant numbers of endogenous, dysfunctional OPCs. (3) Astrogliosis is a pathological hallmark of chronic MS lesions, so the ability of transplanted cells to survive within astrogliosed areas will be a key. OECs but not Schwann cells have been shown to survive in areas of astrocytosis (Barnett and Riddell, 2004), but it is not clear to what extent OECs can be expanded indefinitely in culture. OPCs, on the other hand, possess the ability to colonize areas of astrocytosis (with the caveat that prior depletion of the endogenous OPC population or the presence of an acute inflammatory environment is critical for transplant survival) (Foote and Blakemore, 2005). (4) As multifocal demyelination is another key feature of MS, the ability of transplanted cells to migrate within the CNS may be important unless it is feasible to introduce cells directly into lesions. Multipotent NSCs injected intravenously or intraventricularly can enter areas of demyelination, generate myelinating oligodendrocytes, and mediate functional recovery (possibly because these cells express a range of inflammatory molecules like adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines). This \u201choming\u201d behavior makes them attractive candidates to mediate targeted repair of multifocal lesions. In addition, such cells have been shown to exert significant anti\u2010inflammatory effects and reduce astrocytosis in demyelinated areas. Multipotent NSCs have been isolated from human subcortical WM; these cells can be maintained in vitro prior to transplantation and give rise to neurons and glia, when transplanted into the rodent CNS (Nunes et al., 2003). (5) Given that inflammation appears to be beneficial for remyelination and transplant survival, it will be important to establish the effects of common anti\u2010inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatments (used in MS treatment) on transplant survival and repair. (6) It is critical that the genetic stability and safety of the transplanted cells (including the elimination of pathogens and tumorigenic potential) be established prior to transplantation, (7) potential rejection of transplanted cells and the need for tissue\u2010type matching must be taken into account, and (8) a number of ongoing ethical and political issues relating to the derivation of cells for transplantation will have a serious impact on which therapies can be advanced to clinical trials. Additionally, there are many practical concerns when surgically introducing cells into neural tissue. These include (1) the consequences of disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, (2) the possibility of inducing hemorrhage at the transplant site, (3) the potential expense associated with multiple surgical injections to introduce transplanted cells into multifocal lesions, (iv) the significant challenge associated with accurately targeting transplanted cells to inaccessible CNS lesions sites, and (5) the risk of inducing CSF occlusion or emboli when introducing cells intraventricularly or intravenously. It is clear, therefore, that the benefits of a range of therapeutic strategies can be demonstrated in experimental conditions. The translation of such approaches to the clinical setting will constitute a major objective for future studies.",

In response to a demyelinating insult, the myelinated axons undergo demyelination (1). This generates myelin debris. Demyelination causes activation of resident astrocytes and microglia (2). Activated astrocytes and microglia produce factors that act to recruit monocytes from the vasculature (3). Microglia (4a) and recruited monocytes (4b) differentiate into macrophages. Activated astrocytes and macrophages produce factors that can mutually activate each other (5a). As a result of such activation, both produce growth factors that act on OPCs to alter their proliferation and differentiation (5b). Macrophages remove myelin debris (6), a function that is beneficial for remyelination. Under the influence of factors produced by astrocytes and macrophages, recruited OPCs engage with demyelinated axons (7) and differentiate into remyelinating oligodendrocytes (8).
