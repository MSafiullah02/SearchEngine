Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure. Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis , prescription and follow up evaluation. Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals. Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers. Within its limitations related to the quality and quantity of information sought, this comes as a viable method of patient -physician interfacing during the phase of lockdown.",

Since AYUSH related facilities in the public sector have neither been exposed to the distant consultation related practices nor are resource rich to take up such novel ideas, it was inevitable to keep the medical consultation at bay until the lockdown is Although not supported with adequate data, this initiative of smartphone app based consultation through video calling had been highly gratifying for patients and physician for two reasons. From the perspectives of patients this is the ease of operation and live connectivity with the treating physician which build much of the gratification. This echoed the observations earlier reported as the factors signifying the patient's satisfaction during tele-consultation [9] . From the perspectives of physician, this was the patient's recognition and possibility of indirect examination of joints and their mobility by focusing the camera on particular joints. which formed larger part of the gratification. Once the consultation was over, one team member who was engaged with record keeping (PP) was handed over to explain the treatment to the individual patients. All patients were handed over with a snapshot of a written prescription send to their phones. For the purpose of better record keeping , a feedback record is also generated now for recording the feedbacks during the follow-up calls . The exercise was also gratifying for the team members who were assisting the whole process. For their actual involvement in the process and their availability during the interrogation and examination of the patient as well as during prescription generation, the process simulated a real OP clinic operated in a distant mode having all essentials of learning except direct clinical examination.",

This should however be clearly understood that such distant consultation approaches have their limitations and can never be considered as a substitution to the normal OP based physical consultation.

            "text": "19 pandemic and subsequent measures to mitigate it have presented the world with certain unprecedented situations. Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure. Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis , prescription and follow up evaluation. Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals. Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers. Within its limitations related to the quality and quantity of information sought, this comes as a viable method of patient -physician interfacing during the phase of lockdown. Key words: Smartphone, Online Consultation, Telemedicine, Whatsapp , Arthritis , Ayurveda , Lockdown , COVID -19 On the brighter side of COVID-19 induced Lockdown: Devising the collateral methods to provide Ayurveda consultation during impasse Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures to mitigate it have presented the world with certain unprecedented situations. Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure. Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis , prescription and follow up evaluation. Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals. Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers.

            "text": "to help the patients in the lockdown phase. Empowered with almost 2000 patient's registry inclusive of their contact details, the clinic decided to launch its online consultation facility through a popular video calling app (Whatsapp) on its regular Out Patient (OP) days and timings. The idea was to give the enrolled patients an access to the follow-up care so that their issues related to joint health may be addressed. After an initial in-house discussion with team members to determine the modus operandi of interfacing, team members were assigned with specific jobs like coordinating the calls (NS), record keeping (PP) , explaining the components of advice (NS, PP) and consultation (SR). Local media was informed of this initiative and the whatsapp number of the clinic coordinator was shared with press. The online OP services of Gathiya Clinic through whatsapp based video calling were finally flagged off in mid-April after the initiation of the 2 nd phase of national lockdown and are running continuously on two scheduled days of the week already designated as Gathiya Clinic days. Five of such app based OP consultation sittings have been observed so far keeping a variable range of 5-8 patients in one OP sitting. The individual video calls spanned between 3 to 10 minutes excluding the time spend for connecting and coordinating the calls and prescription generation.",

            "text": "inherent limitations. There are several limitations of this distant consultation process and approach. These limitations may be categorised in three major categories-1) limitation related to quality and quantity of information available during such interaction. This implies to the inability of having a physical examination which is one most crucial component of medical consultation process 2) Limitation related to technicality involved in interfacing. This pertains to the availability of smartphone, internet connectivity and availability of desired application in the smartphone of the end user. 3) Limitation related to legality of the prescription generated through such consolations. Legality raised against such nonphysical consultations largely relates to the consent of the patient and legal standing of prescriptions generated.Seeing the urgency and immediate need of such novel approaches to resume the health care services in AYUSH, Central Council of Indian Medicine has recently issued a detailed guideline about telemedicine practice for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani Practitioners[10].",
