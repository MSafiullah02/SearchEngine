We formulate this as a non-convex regularisation problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artefacts. Despite being non-convex, the proposed method has guaranteed convergence via a proximal splitting algorithm and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line identification method, and show a considerable performance gain with 87% correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients. In addition, owing to its fast convergence, which takes around 12 seconds for a given frame, our proposed method is readily applicable for processing LUS image sequences.",

B-lines in particular, are line artefacts originating at the pleural line within the lungs and are caused by ultrasound reverberations generated by the water-thickened interlobular septa and other sub-pleural structures.

            "text": "A clinical limitation when using LUS is that quantification of line artefacts relies on visual estimation and thus may not accurately reflect generalised fluid overload or the severity of conditions such as interstitial lung disease or severe pneumonia. Moreover, currently the technique is operator-dependent and requires specialist training. Therefore, reliable image processing techniques that improve the visibility of lines and facilitate line detection in speckle images are essential. However, only a few automatic approaches have been reported in the literature [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The method in [4] employs angular features and thresholding (AFT). A B-line is detected in a particular image column if each feature exceeds a predefined threshold. The method in [5] uses alternate sequential filtering (ASF). A repeated sequential morphological opening and closing approach is applied to the mask until potential B-lines are separated. In [7] , an inverse problem based method has been proposed for line detection in ultrasound images, referred to as the Pulmonary Ultrasound Image analysis method (PUI) hereafter. It involves p -norm regularisation, which promotes sparsity via small norm orders p > 0, and is shown to be suitable for the detection of B-line, as well as of other line artefacts, including Z-lines and A-lines. More recently, deep neural network strategies have also been employed, provided training data exists, in order to detect and localise line artefacts in LUS [9] , [10] .",

The proposed non-convex regularisation scheme is based on the Cauchy penalty function. Despite being non-convex, the proposed methodology can be guaranteed to converge following [11] , whilst benefiting from the advantages offered by a non-convex penalty function. Furthermore, following the reconstruction via non-convex regularisation, a novel automatic line artefacts quantification procedure is proposed, which offers detecting horizontal (pleural, and either sub-pleural or A-lines), and vertical (B-lines) line artefacts in LUS measurements of several COVID-19 patients. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art B-line detection method, PUI [7] . We show B-line quantification performance of 87% with a gain of around 8% over PUI [7] . Thanks to its fast convergence, the proposed method allows image sequence analysis as well, whereby processing a single frame takes between 11 and 13 seconds.",

            "text": "Linear artefacts are thought to arise from ultrasound reverberations generated by the water-thickened interlobular septa and other sub-pleural structures [14] . These artefacts are referred to as B-lines. When the air content decreases and lung density increases due to the presence in the lung of transudate, the acoustic mismatch between the lung and the surrounding tissues is lowered, and the ultrasound beam can be partly reflected at deeper zones and repeatedly. This phenomenon creates discrete vertical hyperechoic reverberation artefacts (B-lines), that arise from the pleural line [15] . The presence of a few scattered B-lines can be a normal variant, found in healthy subjects, especially in the lower intercostal spaces. Multiple B-lines are considered sonographic sign of lung interstitial syndrome, and their number increases along with decreasing air content and increase in lung density [16] . Note that the B-lines are counted as one if they originate from the same point on the pleural line. A-line artefacts are repetitive horizontal echoic lines with equidistant intervals, which are also equal to the distance between skin and pleural line [17] . The A-lines indicate sub-pleural air, which completely reflects the ultrasound beam. The length of an A-line can be roughly the same as the pleural line, but it can also be shorter, or even not visible because of sound beam attenuation through the lung medium. An example depicting the A-and B-line artefacts in LUS is presented in Fig. 1 .",

If the image sequence includes some informing text or other scanner related information, all these are removed, so that only ultrasound can be processed by the following steps. Step 2) Pre-processing for regularisation: A pre-processing step is then applied to each image frame before employing the non-convex regularisation algorithm. Specifically, the pre-processing procedure includes a transformation in the image domain, which creates a \"probe centred\" image. An example of this procedure is presented in Figure 3 . An image frame decomposed from a image sequence is considered and the probe centre is located in the centre of a new template image. In Figure 3-(b) the probe centred image corresponding to the image frame in (a) is shown. The reason behind this operation is coming from a process we apply for detecting candidate B-lines in Radon transform domain. Note that a similar idea has been proven to be successful in an application of ship wake detection of synthetic aperture radar imaging of the sea surface in [22] , [23] . An example for the effect of the procedure in this step in Radon space is also shown in Figures 3-(c) and (d) . As it can be clearly seen from (d), the corresponding peak points in Radon domain (corresponding to candidate B-lines in image domain) for probe centred image are located in the middle of the vertical Radon domain axis, whilst they cover a larger area in (c). This helps to limit the search area in Radon domain to a smaller useful range, which increases the detection accuracy and reduces the number of false detection because of noisy peak points in Radon domain. Although this procedure doubles the input image size, which causes a higher computational load, this is counterbalanced by a significant increase in detection performance.",

The B-line detection performance was measured using several metrics regrouped in Table II . [7] in terms of the metrics given in Table II , based on manual detections given by two clinical doctors experts in LUS. These quantitative results reveal that the proposed method improves B-line identification performance by 8% when compared to PUI. Both methods had the same false detection performance whilst the missed detection performance of the proposed method is around 8% less then PUI. The main important reason for this performance can be expressed via the proposed validation mechanism in the proposed methodology (Step 7), which is not performed in PUI. As illustrated in Fig. 5 , our approach successfully discards non-B-line detections and reduces the percentage of missed detections by up to 5%. Furthermore, F \u03b2 metric clearly demonstrates that the proposed method is better for three different weighting performed for recall and precision metrics. Figure 7 shows a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which illustrates the performances of the Bline identification methods via TPR and FPR. We considered the existence of B-lines and the non-existence of B-lines as positive and negative classes, respectively. The ROC curve shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms PUI. This also confirms the robust characteristics of the proposed approach since it achieves high recall (sensitivity) and area under curve (AUC) values. Figure 6 shows the line artefact quantification results for various frames captured for different patients. The detected horizontal lines were drawn on the LUS images with red coloured lines, whilst vertical lines were drawn with green (yellow for ground truth annotations) coloured lines. Each row in Figure 6 represents the original, the expert annotated detection results, and PUI results, respectively. When examining each example LUS image along Another important metric shown in Table III is the average number of detected B-lines over all the 100 LUS images. One can observe that the proposed method's average B-line value is closer to the correct number of average B-lines with a normalised mean square error (NMSE) of 0.151, whilst PUI has an NMSE of 0.243. Among all 100 LUS images utilised in this study, the maximum number of B-lines in a single frame is 4 ( Figure 6 -(e)). The proposed method detects all of these correctly whereas PUI achieves a maximum of 3 correctly detected B-lines in a single frame.",
