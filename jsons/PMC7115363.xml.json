            "text": "A number of RNA-based vector systems have been used in the construction of HIV-1 and SIV vaccines. These include vectors based on negative strand RNA viruses [1], [2], [3], positive strand RNA viruses such as Sendai virus [4], coronavirus [5] and lentiviruses [6], and positive strand RNA replicon-based vectors derived from alphaviruses [7], [8], [9], picornaviruses [10], and flaviviruses [11]. Replicon-based vectors exploit the ability of viral non-structural proteins to amplify greatly (in the cytoplasm of infected/transfected cells) the replicon RNA, which encodes both the heterologous protein and the viral non-structural proteins. This results in high-level expression of antigens and provides potent adjuvant activity via double-stranded RNA replication intermediates [12]. We have previously described a replicon vector system based on the Kunjin virus [12], a largely non-pathogenic flavivirus found in northern Australia [13]. Kunjin replicon RNA can be packaged into virus-like particles (VLPs) using a packaging cell line expressing Kunjin structural proteins in trans\n[14]. The resulting VLP vaccines are capable of inducing potent, long-lived and protective CD8 T cell responses in several murine systems [12], [15]. Kunjin replicon VLP vaccines encoding HIV-1 gag have also been shown to induce CD8 T cell immunity comparable to that seen after immunisation with recombinant vaccinia [11]. In contrast to most alphavirus replicon-infected cells, Kunjin replicon-infected cells (i) do not show overt cytopathic effects, so both double strand RNA-induced \u201cdanger signals\u201d and antigen production are maintained for extended periods and (ii) do not produce replication-competent viruses via recombination during VLP manufacture, with recombination in flavivirus systems appearing to be extremely low [12].",

            "text": "The evaluation of SIV vaccines in non-human primates has proved to be an invaluable and enduring model system for testing new concepts in HIV vaccine development [16], [17], [18], [19]. Most SIV and HIV subunit vaccines encode gag, as Gag proteins are believed to be an important target of protective cellular immunity [20], [21]. Herein we describe the construction and immunogenicity of four SIV gag (pol) Kunjin replicon VLP vaccines. The first encodes SIV gag using the wild-type nucleic acid sequence (WT). The second encodes SIV gag using an RNA-optimised nucleic acid sequence (DX). HIV and SIV gag contain RNA inhibitory sequence (INS) elements, which have been shown to act at several levels to inhibit gag expression; primarily via nuclear retention of RNA in the absence of the Rev protein. RNA-optimisation strategies, which remove these INS elements by changing the codon usage, result in significant increases in protein expression from DNA-based expression vectors [22], and such RNA-optimised SIV gag vaccines have been used in a number of monkey trials [23], [24]. Inhibition of nuclear export of gag RNA by INS sequences is unlikely to be an issue for the exclusively cytoplasmic Kunjin replicon RNA, however, INS elements have also been reported to reduce RNA stability and translation [25], [26]. The third SIV gag Kunjin replicon VLP vaccine encodes a human codon-optimised SIV gag gene (OPT). Codon optimisation has been used extensively to improve recombinant antigen expression in a number of systems and the process involves altering the codon usage to the one most commonly utilized in a given species [27], [28]. The fourth vaccine encodes wild-type matrix and capsid from gag-linked in-frame to reverse transcriptase from pol (Gag-pol). This approach has been described previously for HIV Gag and removes from the gag gene sequences that encode proteins with potentially immunosuppressive properties, whilst retaining sequences frequently recognised by T cells [29]. Although all four vaccines expressed Gag protein at comparable levels, they behaved quite differently in terms of immunogenicity, protection and insert stability.",

These two RNA-based Kunjin replicon vectors are the same, except SP6KUNrep6 has two copies of the foot and mouse virus 2A autoprotease, one upstream of MluI (replacing the ubiquitin gene) and another one downstream of the SnaBI cloning sites [12]. The Kunjin SIV gag WT construct encodes SIV mac239 gag subcloned from p239SpSp5\u2032 [31] (catalogue #829, NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program, Germantown, MD, USA) using AscI sites. The Kunjin SIV gag DX construct was generated by subcloning RNA-optimised SIV mac239 gag DX [23], [24] from pFB-SIVgag DX CTE Neo [32] using AscI/SnaBI sites. Kunjin SIVgag OPT was constructed using AscI/SnaBI sites and p01-426 (catalogue #9422, NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program), which encodes human codon-optimised SIVmac239 gag. The Kunjin SIVmac239 Gag-pol vaccine was constructed by separately PCR-amplifying matrix (MA)/nucleocapsid (NC) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes from p239SpSp5\u2032 plasmid (NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) and joining at SacII. The fragment was then cloned into the Mlu I and SnaB I sites of SP6KUNrep6 vector. Construction of the HIV-1 gag vaccine has been described previously and was expressed from the SP6KUNrep1 vector [11]. All gag constructs used in this study-encoded alanine in place of the initial glycine in Gag.",

We have confirmed that the homologous region (299GYISTRVEL207) in Kunjin virus NS3, which contains a substitution (M to L) in the last amino acid, also represents a dominant CD8 T cell epitope for Kunjin replicon vaccines (data not shown). To analyse the levels of anti-vector CD8 T cell responses for the different vaccines shown in Fig. 3A and B, ELISPOT assays using the GYISTRVEL peptide epitope (at 10 \u03bcg/ml) were undertaken. Ex vivo IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT analysis showed that responses ranged from \u2248400 to 1000 spots/106 splenocytes (Fig. 3C). Cultured IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT analysis showed a range of \u22482000\u20135000 spots/106 splenocytes for all the vectors except DX, which gave a large mean response in excess of 40,000 spots/106 splenocytes (Fig. 3D). The very large response for DX might be due to the large number of VLPs not expressing Gag present in the DX preparation (Table 2). These results illustrate that flavivirus replicon-based vectors, like other vector systems [44], [45], also induce CD8 T cell responses specific for vector proteins.",

To investigate to what extent the different SIV gag VLP vaccines suffered from this problem, Vero cells were infected with VLPs and dual-labelled with anti-Kunjin NS1 and anti-Gag antibodies. For WT and Gag-pol the majority of VLP-infected cells expressed both NS1 and Gag, however, for DX and OPT only about 22% and 40% of NS1 positive cells, respectively, also expressed Gag (Table 2). For the HIV gag VLPs this value was >90% (data not shown). The DX and OPT constructs contained RNA- and codon-optimised genes, perhaps suggesting that altering the coding sequence somehow reduces the stability of these inserted genes in the Kunjin replicon constructs. The in vitro transcribed RNA used to transfect the packaging cells did not contain any detectable truncated replicon RNA species (Fig. 4A) indicating that these insert deletion events likely occurred during VLP manufacture. Gene deletion events from flavivirus vectors have not been extensively studied. To gain some insight into the process, RNA from WT and DX VLP-infected cells was analysed by RT-PCR using primers flanking the SIV gag gene insert. The full-length gene is visible at \u22482000 bp, with shorter PCR products evident in both WT and DX infected cells. Gene deletions in WT and DX appear to be different, with DX showing a major band at \u2248180 bp (Fig. 4B, lane 3). A band of the same size was also observed in samples from OPT-infected cells (data not shown). This \u2248180 bp fragment is actually smaller than that obtained from the empty vector (Fig. 4B, lane 4), suggesting that at least one end of the deletion must lie within the ubiquitin cloning site or the FMDV 2A protease region (see Fig. 1). Sequencing of the \u2248180 bp fragment from DX illustrated that the deletion occurred 15 nucleotides past the 5\u2032 end of the 225 nucleotide Ub sequence and 29 nucleotides past the 5\u2032 end of the 48 nucleotide FMDV2A sequence (Fig. 4B). There are no obvious homologies between the sequences either side of the insert deletion site that would suggest strand switching or homologous recombination events.",

The OPT, Gag-pol and DX vaccines all provided significantly better protection than both the controls and the WT vaccine (log-rank tests all p\n \u2264 0.006) (Fig. 5B). OPT vaccination also provided significantly better protection than DX (p\n = 0.031), with no other comparisons showing significant differences (Fig. 5B). Mean tumour growth curves from the same experiment are shown in Fig. 5C. The percentage of mice surviving after challenge with A20-EGFP-SIVgag cells (0, 33, 67 and 100% for WT, DX, Gag-pol, and OPT, respectively, Fig. 5B) correlated well with the mean ex vivo ELISPOT data shown in Fig. 3A (100, 119, 183 and 248 spots/106 splenocytes, respectively), R\n2\n = 0.95. A similar comparison with the cultured ELISPOT data (Fig. 3B) failed to show any correlation, R\n2\n = 0.04, suggesting that effector memory rather than central memory cell activity had a major role in mediating protection in this model.",

In the Kunjin replicon system deletion of inserted genes appears to occur in packaging cells during VLP manufacture. For constructs with low insert stability the proportion of VLPs without inserts increases if the time between RNA transfection of the packaging line and VLP harvest is extended, and appropriate reductions of this time period can result in VLP preparations with substantially fewer empty VLPs (unpublished observation). These observations parallel those obtained for West Nile replicons where VLPs with insert deletions were also rapidly selected during serial passage of VLPs in a packaging cell line [46]. In contrast, we have generated by antibiotic selection several cell lines stably transfected with recombinant Kunjin replicon vectors and these could be extensively passaged without loss of reporter gene inserts [12], suggesting that insert deletion may be rare once a cell is transfected. One might speculate that insert deletion is associated with the cellular stress that leads to the cytopathic effects, which are observed in the packaging cells during VLP manufacture due to the high level of structural protein expression. Conceivably, in such stressed cells replicon RNA may gain access to the nuclear RNA splicing machinery. RNA splicing is well known to be influenced by complex RNA structure interactions, with distant RNA sequences able to regulate splicing events [54]. Why DX and OPT vaccines would be more susceptible to insert deletion remains unclear, but may be associated with the loss of native RNA structures.",

Successful expression of wild-type SIV Gag by other vector systems where mRNA is generated in the cytoplasm (e.g. alphavirus replicons and vaccinia) also supports the view that the major influence of INS elements is on RNA export [9], [55].

The better memory responses induced by the Gag-pol vaccine may be due to the removal of the potentially immunosuppressive gag-encoded proteins [29]. An alphavirus replicon SIV vaccine with these regions deleted also showed improved longevity of T cell responses over full-length gag constructs [8]. The high (albeit variable) central memory responses induced by DX may arise from increased levels of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 produced [56] as a result of the large number of empty VLPs that compromised \u224880% of the VLP inocula for this vaccine preparation (Table 2).",

This model is likely to represent a measure of SIV Gag-specific CD8 T cell activity as rejection of this tumour has previously been shown to be CD8 T cell dependent [57]. Protection from this model also correlated well with the magnitude of ex vivo ELISPOT (effector memory) responses rather than cultured ELISPOT (central memory) responses induced by each of the Kunjin SIV vaccines. This might be expected since tumours are generally poor at stimulating the differentiation of central memory cells into effectors, so prophylactic protection would rely on effector memory cells [58]. The relative importance of effector memory and/or central memory cells for prophylactic protection against HIV-1/SIV has not been extensively studied. Some evidence suggests central memory cells are more important than effector memory cells [59], whereas others have argued that effector activity early in infection (when effector memory T cells would be most active) is important for protection [60] and for slowing progression to AIDS [61].",

There were two control groups, one received 106 IU of a control VLP encoding an irrelevant antigen (control VLP) and the other received no vaccination (control na\u00efve). Ten weeks after the second immunisation, the mice were sacrificed and the splenocytes were assayed for Gag-specific T cell responses by ex vivo IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT using six pools of overlapping peptides spanning either the SIV Gag protein for SIV gag vaccinated animals, or the HIV-1 Gag protein for HIV-1 gag vaccinated animals. Error bars illustrate the variation in responses to each pool. (B) Measurement of Gag-specific responses by cultured IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT assays. The splenocytes from the animals described in (A) were also cultured for 6 days with the pooled SIV or HIV Gag peptides, prior to the ELISPOT assay.
