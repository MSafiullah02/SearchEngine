            "text": "The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumonia are critical to outcomes among transplantation patients. The diagnosis of pneumonia is usually considered when a new radiographic infiltrate is identified. Rarely, pneumonia may present initially without infiltrates in an immunocompromised host. However, even in severely immunosuppressed patients, infectious microbes cause inflammation through innate immune mechanisms that lead to tissue edema which is evident radiographically. The occurrence of pneumonia that is not apparent when a CT scan is included in the assessment is sufficiently rare that it will not be further considered here. Instead, we begin with an abnormal imaging study of the lungs, which is typically obtained during the workup of a symptom or sign such as cough, fever, or chills. The differential diagnosis of a lung infiltrate in a transplantation patient includes several common non-infectious causes. Failure to accurately diagnose non-infectious causes of lung infiltrates can lead to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics, and more importantly to failure to address the underlying pathophysiologic process. This chapter is focused on clinical presentations of pulmonary disorders that mimic infectious pneumonia.",

The classic presentation of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, consisting of acute, bilateral, symmetrical, perihilar infiltrates with interstitial thickening, an enlarged heart, and pleural effusions in a patient with pre-existing heart disease and associated findings of peripheral edema and bibasilar rales, is easy to recognize. However, cardiogenic pulmonary edema may also be the cause of asymmetrical infiltrates in a patient with underlying lung disease, such as bullous emphysema, that precludes alveolar\nfilling in localized regions (see Fig. 21.1). An enlarged heart may not be present on the radiograph if cardiac dysfunction is not longstanding, so that the heart has not had time to remodel (e.g., acute volume overload or diastolic dysfunction secondary to acute ischemia). In these cases, additional studies can be very helpful in establishing the diagnosis [4\u20136]. CT of the chest may show the diffuse nature of alveolar infiltrates and pleural effusions that are less apparent on plain films, and may additionally reveal interstitial edema and cardiac chamber enlargement. Review of serial radiographs may show infiltrates that wax and\nwane in association with variations in patient weight, peripheral edema, or fluid administration. Echocardiography is very supportive when it reveals systolic dysfunction, but it is important to recognize that diastolic dysfunction is an equally prevalent cause of heart failure [7], potentially exacerbated by rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation, valvular dysfunction, or transient ventricular wall stiffening due to ischemia. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are quite specific and sensitive but are less elevated in\ndiastolic than in systolic dysfunction [7].\n",

Sepsis is the most common cause of permeability edema of the lungs in general [6, 9, 10] and can cause radiographic infiltrates in transplant\npatients. In addition, transplant patients are susceptible to lung injury from causes unique to this population, such as from chemotherapy or the effects of acute GVHD. Transplant patients are also frequently exposed to treatments associated with lung injury in the general hospital population, such as transfusion. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the leading cause of mortality from transfusions [11] and has been associated with all plasma-containing blood products, including immunoglobulins. The incidence of TRALI is not known, but has been estimated at 0.02% per unit transfused and 0.16% per patient transfused [12]. Patients with TRALI commonly present with\ndyspnea, cough, fever, acute hypoxemia hypotension, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates within 1\u20136 h after the transfusion. Transient leukopenia, due to pulmonary sequestration of the circulating pool of leukocytes, may be observed. The mainstay of treatment for TRALI is to discontinue the transfusion, followed by supportive care. Although there has never been a randomized controlled trial of glucocorticoid therapy, they have no effect on the 5\u20138% mortality. With supportive treatment, infiltrates usually\nresolve, within 96 h, and survivors have no long-term sequelae [13].",

In more severe cases, systemic involvement, i.e., renal failure, hepatic failure, encephalopathy, or seizures, may be observed. Seen most often following autologous HSCT, ES has also been described in those individuals who have undergone allogeneic HSCT with a non-myeloablative preparative therapy. Although the pathophysiology of ES is not well understood, it is thought to result from a combination of endothelial injury due to preconditioning chemotherapy and the production and release of cytokines and products of neutrophil degranulation and oxidative metabolism, leading to capillary leak, with either local injury in the lung or systemic tissue injury [14]. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may show a neutrophilic alveolitis. Surgical lung biopsies, when obtained, often reveal diffuse alveolar damage. Treatment entails observation and supportive care (i.e., antibiotics, intravenous fluids) in mild cases. High-dose corticosteroid therapy is very effective, often resulting in rapid clinical improvement in those with progressive or symptomatic ES. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation has been observed, however, in up to\none-third of patients [15].",

DAH is now known to occur in both allogeneic and autologous transplant recipients and is seen in\napproximately 5% of all HSCT [22]. The etiology is unclear, but is not clearly related to any specific coagulopathy or to thrombocytopenia [23]. Pre-transplant high-dose chemotherapy, thoracic and/or total body irradiation, and undocumented infections are putative factors which may cause the initial injury, priming the lung for subsequent development of DAH. It can coincide with stem cell engraftment, but late onset (after the first 30 days) has been observed and is associated with a worse prognosis. Hemoptysis occurs in less than 20%\nof patients. Bronchoscopic diagnostic criteria include progressively bloodier returns on BAL or the presence of 20% or more hemosiderin-laden macrophages on cytologic inspection of BAL fluid. However, these bronchoscopic criteria may be seen in association with diffuse lung injury from a wide variety of causes, including infections, congestive heart failure, and malignancy. There are no prospective randomized trials\naddressing the treatment of DAH. Earlier retrospective studies demonstrated reduced need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in a cohort of patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids, but more recent observational studies found no survival benefit [24, 25].",

            "text": "Lung injury may occur either from a\ndrug\u2019s cytotoxic mechanism or from its presence as an antigen. The histologic and radiographic patterns produced vary and include Usual Interstitial Pneumonitis (UIP)/fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. Bleomycin produces lung injury both by cytotoxic action and as an antigen. It is used primarily to treat Hodgkin\u2019s disease and forms a moiety with ferrous ions that induces oxidative injury to tumor cells [28]. Human lungs and skin lack an enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase, which limits injury to other tissues. A UIP/fibrosis pathology is produced, with peripheral and basal infiltrates [29]. (See Fig. 21.2.) Exposure to supplemental oxygen can exacerbate this form of toxicity, by potentiating oxidative injury. As an antibiotic, bleomycin can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis, with high fevers and acute infiltrates. This presentation tends to be responsive to steroid therapy [28\u201330]. Methotrexate also produces hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It is used both for the treatment of lymphoma and for prophylaxis against GVHD after HSCT. In contrast to bleomycin, the hypersensitivity from methotrexate can be accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia and thoracic adenopathy [31, 32]. Granulomas are seen on biopsy, and the toxicity is responsive to steroid therapy [31]. The substituted nucleoside fludarabine may also produce granulomatous disease, as well as eosinophilic pneumonia [33, 34]. Etoposide is rarely toxic but can produce a severe hypersensitivity reaction with symptoms of angioedema or ARDS [35, 36]. Etoposide use is common in HSCT, as a component of the ICE (ifosfamide, cisplatin, and etoposide) regimen,\nas a \u201csalvage\u201d regimen for lymphoma, and also as an induction agent [37, 38]. Cytarabine, commonly used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), may cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This is usually responsive to steroid therapy and is resolved prior to transplant [39]. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor useful in the treatment of CML. In addition to producing pleural effusions, ground-glass opacities can be seen as well as alveolar septal thickening [40].\n",

Following transplantation, immunosuppressive agents to prevent GVHD are prescribed for patients who received allogeneic grafts. Anti-thymocyte globulin is an antibody derived from rabbit or equine serum that can produce interstitial infiltrates and progress to ARDS [41, 42]. The mechanism of lung injury is not clear. As ATG is an anti-leukocyte antibody, the pathogenesis may be similar to that of transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI), or it may stem from its presence as a foreign protein [41, 42]. BCNU may produce DILI within 6 weeks of administration or as late as 20 years after administration to treat pediatric cancers [43, 44]. It presents with diffuse infiltrates and dyspnea, generally without fever, and is irregularly responsive to steroid therapy. The alkylating agents busulfan, melphalan, and cyclophosphamide can all produce a UIP/fibrosing pattern of injury [27]. Busulfan was the first cytotoxic agent described to produce lung injury more than 50 years ago [45]. In one series, the incidence of toxicity was 46% [46]. Today, it is only used as an induction agent for HSCT. Melphalan is well-tolerated at standard doses but given at the high doses used for induction\ncan produce a DIP-like presentation [47]. Cyclophosphamide, used to treat lymphoma and for induction, can produce an early-onset pneumonitis, within 1\u20136 months of administration, which may be responsive to cessation of the drug or steroid therapy [48]. It can also produce fibrosis and pleural thickening that can chronically progress despite cessation. Rituximab, which is a B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody, is used to treat lymphomas and rheumatologic ailments. It can be used for induction as well. Symptoms may\nappear as early as 30 days or as late as 5 months. It rarely causes interstitial lung disease, with only 121 cases reported to date; however, 15% of the cases were fatal [49]. Sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are mTOR inhibitors used for prevention of GVHD and for treatment of renal and other cancers [50, 51]. The mTOR inhibitors can all cause pneumonitis and are discussed in the subsequent section on solid organ transplantation.",

The symptoms and radiographic findings are a consequence of both radiation injury per se to pulmonary parenchyma and the host immunologic response to the injury. Bilateral lymphocytic alveolitis is seen after radiation is administered to only one lung [52, 53]. Roberts et al. performed bilateral BAL on 17 patients receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer, and bilateral lymphocytic alveolitis was seen even in the 15 asymptomatic patients [52]. This type presentation can be appreciated as part of the natural course of radiation-induced lung injury in the young patient shown in Fig. 21.3. Three months earlier, he had received a hilar \u201cboost\u201d of radiation\ntherapy prior to an HSCT for Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Low-grade fevers and increased interstitial markings (Fig. 21.3a, b) evolved over weeks into the dramatic infiltrate seen in Fig. 21.3c. By the time of the final radiograph, fevers had resolved and no steroids were prescribed. In general, radiation lung injury may be treated as a self-limited process, with steroid therapy reserved for\npatients who are febrile or hypoxic.\n",

There was a lower\nincidence of severe toxicity among patients treated with 10.2 cGy in 6 twice-daily fractions (7 of 57, 12%); however, the difference was not significant (P-0.19).

Cough and fever are the most common symptoms of COP on presentation; dyspnea, if present, is mild, and, in some cases, patients are asymptomatic [61]. COP usually presents with patchy bilateral alveolar opacities which can be migratory on chest radiograph. The opacities have a lower lobe\npredominance and are peripheral in location. They may appear as ground-glass opacities or consolidation with air bronchograms on high-resolution CT scans (see Fig. 21.5a). Occasionally, COP can present radiographically as a solitary nodule or mass mimicking a neoplasm or chronic non-resolving pneumonia. In 1 retrospective study of 43 cancer patients, 81% of patients with solid organ tumors had nodular or mass-like radiographic abnormalities, and 19% presented with diffuse infiltrates [62]. In the same study, diffuse infiltrates were seen in the majority of patients with hematologic malignancies, including\nHSCT, and mimicked infection and drug-induced toxicity.\n",

A decline in oxygenation and/or spirometry values is often seen. Notably, similar clinical, radiographic, and physiologic features accompany bouts of infection; reliance on these features to make a diagnosis of acute rejection runs the risk of misdiagnosis and needless augmentation of immunosuppression. Rather, transbronchial lung biopsies should be obtained in all suspected cases, unless contraindicated by severe hypoxemia or marginal lung function. The reported sensitivity of transbronchial biopsies in the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection is 61\u201394% and the specificity exceeds 90% [77]. Diagnosis\nrequires demonstration of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates that in more severe cases spill over into the adjacent interstitium and alveolar spaces. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis may accompany the parenchymal involvement or may be an independent feature. Standard treatment for acute cellular rejection consists of a 3-day pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone, typically at a dose of 15 mg/kg. In most cases, this leads to clinical and radiographic improvement within several days. Anti-thymocyte globulin is employed in refractory cases.\n",

The clinical presentation can be indistinguishable\nfrom acute cellular rejection or infection, with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and diffuse radiographic opacities. Hemoptysis, reflecting the presence of capillaritis, is an important clue but occurs in only 25% of cases [79]. Proposed diagnostic criteria for acute antibody-mediated rejection are (1) presence of circulating donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, (2) histopathological evidence of capillaritis, and (3) detection of endothelial cell C4d deposition. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is effective in less than half of patients; the addition of plasmapheresis is beneficial in the majority of steroid-refractory cases [79]. Intravenous immunoglobulin and anti-CD20\nmonoclonal antibodies have also been used as adjunctive therapy.",

However, this technique is limited by a lack of consensus on the appropriate specimen source (serum, whole blood, or peripheral mononuclear cells) and by varying threshold value definitions of a positive result.

Initial reports suggested that interstitial pneumonitis was largely a complication of excessive sirolimus blood concentrations, but more recent reports have documented cases in the setting of therapeutic drug levels.\nApproximately 50% of cases develop within the first 6 months after initiation of the drug. Onset is usually insidious, but acute and fulminant presentations have been described [95]. Common presenting symptoms include dyspnea, non-productive cough, and fever; hemoptysis is occasionally present. Radiographic abnormalities include bilateral interstitial infiltrates, alveolar consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and nodules (Fig. 21.10). Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals evidence of a lymphocytic alveolitis and, less commonly, of alveolar hemorrhage. Histological\nfindings are diverse and include bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates, alveolar hemorrhage, and non-necrotizing granulomas. Discontinuation of the drug typically leads to prompt clinical improvement while radiographic abnormalities may take several months to fully resolve.

(a) A PA chest radiograph from 09-01-1994 showed increased interstitial markings on the right. (b) A PA chest radiograph on 09-07-1994 during a febrile episode attributed to an infected catheter showed an increase in the interstitial infiltrates. (c) The pulmonary service was consulted to evaluate this PA chest radiograph on 09-22-1994; however, the patient was asymptomatic. (d) A chest CT confirmed the linear border of the infiltrate and revealed an unsuspected small effusion. No treatment was prescribed",
