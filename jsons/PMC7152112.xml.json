Rarely, it has been implicated as a cause of enteritis in dogs, and it was found in the brains of puppies with neurologic signs.9 The virus replicates in nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells; epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa, pharynx, and tonsillar crypts; mucous cells in the trachea and bronchi; and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. CAV-2 can also be isolated from retropharyngeal and bronchial lymph nodes as well as epithelial cells of the intestinal tract. Shedding typically ceases 1 to 2 weeks after initial infection.",

There is evidence of widespread exposure to CHV-1 in dogs worldwide,10 and a substantial proportion of the dog population may be latently infected. Like other herpesviruses, CHV-1 becomes latent in neurologic tissues, with precipitation of virus shedding by stress. Consistent with the time delay required for reactivation after stress, CHV-1 was most frequently detected 3 to 4 weeks after dogs were introduced to a rehoming center, whereas CRCoV and CPiV were most frequently detected in the first and second week. Dogs infected with CHV-1 were more likely to have severe respiratory disease, although severe respiratory disease itself might predispose dogs to the shedding of CHV-1.10 Infection with CHV-1 was reported in association with fatal hepatic necrosis in an adult dog that lacked any evidence of immunosuppression.15 Refer to Chapter 16 for information on CHV-1 infections in neonates.",

To date, 16 H types and 9 N types have been identified, each of which are antigenically distinct.16 The names of influenza viruses are specified as follows: influenza genus (A, B, or C)/host/geographic origin/strain number/year of isolation and, in parentheses, H and N type\u2014for example, A/canine/Florida/43/2004 (H3N8).17 Extensive genomic rearrangements that occur within influenza A viruses allow for occasional cross-species transmission among birds and mammals. These rearrangements occur when two different viruses simultaneously infect a host, with subsequent genetic reassortment. Occasionally, cross-species transmission occurs without alteration of the viral genome.",

            "text": "In the United States, CIV emerged in racing greyhounds in Florida in 2003 and 2004,17 where it caused hemorrhagic pneumonia and a high mortality. However, serologic evidence of infection in the greyhound dog population dates back to 1999.18 Infections spread slowly and were subsequently reported in racing greyhounds and non-greyhounds in at least 38 U.S. states. Outbreaks have continued to occur in shelter situations for nearly a decade after the virus was discovered. The virus that currently circulates in the United States is an H3N8 virus that closely resembles an equine influenza virus, which suggested that an interspecies jump occurred without genetic reassortment.17 Instead, accumulation of point mutations with minor amino acid changes occurred, with sustained transmission among dogs. The most significant outbreaks of disease due to CIV have occurred in Florida, New England, Colorado, Wyoming, and Texas. In many other states, sustained transmission of the virus from one dog to another has not occurred. The most significant risk factor for infection has been indoor housing.19 Virtually all cases to date have involved dogs in kennels, animal shelters, or dog daycare facilities. Dogs of all ages and breeds are susceptible, but to date severe hemorrhagic pneumonia has occurred only in greyhounds.20 The virus is shed for up to 7 to 10 days. CIV has retained the ability to infect horses, but horses develop only mild disease or no clinical signs.20\n",

The prefix reo- stands for respiratory enteric orphan virus, which highlights the tropism of reoviruses for cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, and their uncommon association with disease. Despite serologic evidence of widespread exposure to reoviruses in dogs, they have been found only rarely in dogs with respiratory disease8., 37. and dogs with enteritis.38 There are three mammalian reovirus (MRV) serotypes, and all three have been detected in dogs. The role of reoviruses in disease causation in dogs is unclear, because disease has not been reproducible experimentally. It has been speculated that reoviruses might act synergistically with other respiratory pathogens to cause disease.10\n",

Alone, CRCoV causes subclinical infections or mild respiratory disease, but like human respiratory coronaviruses, it can cause reversible damage to, or loss of, the cilia on respiratory epithelial cells (Figure 17-1\n).

Serologic evidence of exposure to CRCoV is widespread in dogs from North America, Great Britain and continental Europe, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand,10., 41., 42., 43. and the virus has been detected widely using PCR-based methods in dogs with respiratory disease from many of these countries.

Suitable specimens for respiratory virus isolation are nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, transtracheal or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, or upper airway or lung tissue obtained at necropsy. If swabs are used to collect specimens, polyester-tipped swabs and specific virus transport media should be used. Cotton swabs should be avoided, because influenza viruses adhere to the cotton, which can lead to reduced sensitivity.20 Virus isolation is a specialized process that may take several days. As with PCR assays, sensitivity may be low because shedding of respiratory viruses occurs early in the course of illness and may be transient.

At necropsy, CRCoV is most readily detected in upper respiratory tract specimens, such as the nasal mucosa, nasal tonsil, and trachea.52 Lung specimens may also yield positive results. Unfortunately, false-negative PCR results are common, especially in antemortem specimens, because of transient or low-level shedding of many respiratory viruses. In addition, because many respiratory viruses are RNA viruses and RNA is very labile when compared with DNA, false negatives can occur when viral RNA degrades during specimen transport.\n",

Prevention of transmissible respiratory tract disease in dogs therefore involves not only vaccination, but also control methods that include quarantine of dogs introduced into densely populated environments, early identification and isolation of dogs with signs of respiratory disease through proper training of shelter personnel, avoidance of overcrowding and mixing of dogs, use of solid walls between runs, reduction of time dogs spend in a shelter environment, optimum nutrition, fomite control, control of noise such as barking, and proper ventilation and disinfection (see Box 11-5). Distances traveled by aerosols generated by dogs are unknown. Dogs with respiratory disease should be separated from other dogs in shelter environments by at least 25 feet (or as far as possible) and ideally placed in an enclosed room with a separate ventilation system. Isolated dogs should not be moved back into the general shelter population, but adopted out of isolation or a separate recovery room. Provided proper cleaning and contact times are used, use of disinfectants with activity against parvovirus should also kill respiratory viruses, with CAV-2 being the respiratory virus that is most resistant to disinfection.

Exposed dogs could also be transferred to foster care in a household with no other dogs. Because of a lack of adequate resources for treatment, diagnostic evaluation, and management, some shelters have elected to euthanize large numbers of affected dogs.\n",

Other dogs in the household should be vaccinated before they are placed in contact with the shelter animal. Clients should also be instructed to ensure their local veterinary clinic is aware that their dog is newly adopted from a shelter, so that precautions can be taken to prevent contamination of the hospital environment when the dog is examined a few days after leaving the shelter.",

            "text": "Viruses related to simian virus 5 (parainfluenza virus 5) have been detected in humans, but the role of CPiV as a human pathogen is controversial. Reoviruses have a broad host range, and human infection has been associated with enteritis and respiratory disease; MRV-3 infection was associated with meningitis in a child.64 Thus they represent a potential zoonosis. Although adenoviruses, influenza viruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses cause respiratory disease in humans, there is no evidence that CAV-2, CIV, CDV, CHV-1, or CRCoV can be transmitted to humans. Human influenza viruses such as H1N1 can cause disease in dogs and may have the potential to spread from infected dogs back to humans.CASE EXAMPLESignalment\u201cWinnie\u201d, a 10-year old male neutered miniature Schnauzer from Sacramento, CAHistoryWinnie was brought to his local veterinarian because of a 1-day history of serous ocular and nasal discharge, and sneezing. Fever (103.5\u00b0F or 39.7\u00b0C) was documented on physical examination, and enrofloxacin (2 mg/kg PO q24h), bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin ophthalmic ointment (both eyes q8h), and diphenhydramine (2.2 mg/kg PO q12h) were prescribed, without clinical improvement. A day later, he became lethargic, inappetent, and polydipsic, and the owners described continuous nasal discharge, and a moist cough. Winnie was brought to the UC Davis VMTH for a second opinion. He had been vaccinated regularly for CDV, CAV-2, CPV, rabies, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and CPiV. He was recently cared for in a boarding facility for a week and had been home for the past 11 days. He also regularly visited dog parks. There were two other miniature Schnauzers at home, and both were currently well.Current MedicationsEnrofloxacin, 2 mg/kg PO q24hOther Medical HistoryIncreased activity of serum ALP was noted at a senior care visit 2 months before the onset of respiratory signs.Physical ExaminationBody Weight9.4 kgGeneralLethargic but hydrated. T = 100.8\u00b0F (38.2\u00b0C), HR = 104 beats/min, respiratory rate = 12 breaths/min, mucous membranes pink, CRT = 1 to 2 s.Eyes, Ears, Nose, and ThroatSevere chemosis, hyperemia, and mucoid ocular discharge were present bilaterally. There was also profuse bilateral serous nasal discharge and decreased nasal airflow, hypersalivation, and right tonsillar enlargement.MusculoskeletalBody condition score 5/9.RespiratoryStertorous respiratory noises were noted. Increased respiratory effort with a normal respiratory rate was also present. Auscultation revealed referred wheezing noises in all lung fields.GastrointestinalTense abdomen, hepatomegaly was detected on abdominal palpation.All Other SystemsNo abnormalities were detected.Ophthalmologic ExaminationPupillary light reflexes (PLRs) (direct and consensual) were brisk and complete. There was no evidence of anisocoria. Menace response, dazzle, and palpebral reflexes were all complete. Globe position and movements were normal bilaterally (OU). Periorbital palpation and globe retropulsion were also normal. The dog behaved as if sighted. The eyelids were normal. Both nictitans were hyperemic and edematous, and there was moderate conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and mucoid ocular discharge OU. Bilateral iris atrophy and lens nuclear sclerosis were also present. The cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous, and dilated fundic examination were normal OU. In the left eye (OS), a pinpoint incipient anterior cortical cataract was identified just ventral to the center of the lens. In the right eye (OD), a linear pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule was present at the 5 o\u2019clock position.Schirmer Tear Test8 mm/min OUIntraocular Pressure16 mm Hg OS, 17 mm Hg ODFluorescein StainMultiple dendritic ulcers were identified at the ventral peripheral cornea OD (see Figure 17-2).Laboratory FindingsCBCHCT 53.5% (40-55%)MCV 67.7 fL (65-75 fL)MCHC 35.3 g/dL (33-36 g/dL)1 nucleated red cell/100 WBCsWBC 14,600 cells/\u00b5L (6000-13,000 cells/\u00b5L)Neutrophils 10,804 cells/\u00b5L (3000-10,500 cells/\u00b5L)Band neutrophils 438 cells/\u00b5LLymphocytes 1752 cells/\u00b5L (1000-4000 cells/\u00b5L)Monocytes 1460 cells/\u00b5L (150-1200 cells/\u00b5L)Eosinophils 0 cells/\u00b5L (0-1500 cells/\u00b5L)Platelets 216,000 platelets/\u00b5L (150,000-400,000 platelets/\u00b5L)A few highly reactive lymphocytes were noted.Serum Chemistry ProfileSodium 142 mmol/L (145-154 mmol/L)Potassium 6.1 mmol/L (3.6-5.3 mmol/L)Chloride 102 mmol/L (105-116 mmol/L)Bicarbonate 25 mmol/L (16-26 mmol/L)Phosphorus 6.7 mg/dL (3.0-6.2 mg/dL)Calcium 9.5 mg/dL (9.9-11.4 mg/dl)BUN 20 mg/dL (8-31 mg/dL)Creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (0.5-1.6 mg/dL)Glucose 80 mg/dL (60-104 mg/dL)Total protein 5.7 g/dL (5.4-7.4 g/dL)Albumin 2.2 g/dL (2.9-4.2 g/dL)Globulin 3.5 g/dL (2.3-4.4 g/dL)ALT 564 U/L (19-67 U/L)AST 116 U/L (21-54 U/L)ALP 1024 U/L (15-127 U/L)Gamma GT 10 U/L (0-6 U/L)Cholesterol 195 mg/dL (135-345 mg/dL)Total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL (0-0.4 mg/dL).UrinalysisSGr 1.009; pH 8.5, negative for protein, bilirubin, hemoprotein, glucose; rare WBC/HPF, 0 RBC/HPF, 0-3 hyaline casts/HPF, few amorphous crystals, moderate degenerated cells and amorphous debris in the sediment.Imaging FindingsThoracic and Cervical RadiographsA mild to moderate bronchial and interstitial pattern was identified and was most prominent in the caudal lung fields. Cervical radiographs were unremarkable. The pulmonary changes were considered nonspecific, but more significant than those expected due to age.Abdominal UltrasoundThe cranial pole of the right adrenal was mildly to moderately enlarged. The liver appeared sonographically normal. A 3 mm stone was identified in the urinary bladder.Microbiologic TestingA nasal swab specimen was submitted for real-time PCR panel for canine respiratory pathogens, which included CHV-1, CIV, CDV, CPiV, CAV-2, and B. bronchiseptica. The results were available 3 days later, and the specimen was positive for CHV-1 DNA.DiagnosisUpper respiratory disease and keratitis associated with CHV-1 infection.TreatmentWinnie was hospitalized in isolation and treated with 0.9% NaCl (30 mL/hr IV), nebulization for 15 min q8h, clavulanic acid-amoxicillin (13.5 mg/kg PO q12h), and lubricating eye ointment (1 inch OU q4h). Clinical improvement occurred a day later, electrolyte abnormalities normalized, and the dog was discharged with instructions to administer topical idoxuridine (0.1% ophthalmic solution, 2 drops OU q4-6h). Unfortunately a caretaker of the dog did not regularly administer the idoxuridine. At a recheck 5 weeks after the dog was first seen, the owner reported 80% improvement in Winnie\u2019s respiratory signs, but he continued to sneeze approximately six times a day and was pawing at his eyes. Examination revealed persistent conjunctivitis, and a fluorescein stain showed large, superficial areas of uptake over the central cornea OU (see Figure 17-2). A Schirmer tear test (STT) was 13 mm/min OS and 8 mm/min OD. A CBC was normal, and the serum biochemistry profile showed persistently increased ALP (835 U/L) and GGT activities (12 U/L) and improvement in the serum ALT activity (124 U/L). The owner was instructed to administer idoxuridine for an additional 2 weeks, as well as lubricating ointment, bacitracin-neomycin ophthalmic ointment (q8h OU), and l-lysine gel (2 mL [400 mg] q12h PO), separating the ophthalmic medications with administration of the idoxuridine first. At a recheck 2 weeks later, all signs had resolved and there was no fluorescein uptake. STT results were 14 mm/min OS and 10 mm/min OD. The idoxuridine was discontinued. Winnie had another episode of respiratory signs 4 months later, at which time the STT results were 15 mm/min OU. Treatment with lubricating eye ointment and l-lysine was continued.CommentsThis was an unusual case of ocular and respiratory herpesviral infection. The early detection of dendritic ulcers allowed a connection to be made between the clinical signs and positive PCR assay result. The negative PCR assay results for other respiratory pathogens did not rule out the possibility of co-infections, because shedding of these organisms may have ceased or been at undetectable levels. Although idoxuridine was used to treat this dog, topical cidofovir may also have been effective.50 Approximately 2 years later, mild serous nasal discharge and depigmentation of the planum nasale developed. A biopsy of the nasal planum showed epitheliotropic lymphoma. The dog was treated with multiagent chemotherapy for over a year without relapse of herpetic keratitis.\n",
