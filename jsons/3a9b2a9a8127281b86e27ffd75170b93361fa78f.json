It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting Covid-19 cases using chest X-rays. Therefore, in this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect Covid-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The deep model called CoroNet has been trained and tested on a dataset prepared by collecting Covid-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. The experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.5%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for Covid-19 cases are 97% and 100%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during Covid-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of Covid-19 cases.",

Covid-19 is contagious and spreads through respiratory transmission when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread when a person touches virus exposed surface or object and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth. Due to its contagious nature, the virus spreads rapidly and infected around 60000 people 19,899 deaths respectively [2] .

Currently, the main screening method used for detecting COVID-19 is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) [4] [5]. The test is done on respiratory samples of the patient and the results can be available within few hours to 2 days. An alternate method to PCR screening method can be based on chest radiography images. Various research articles published in Radiology journal [6] [7] indicate that that chest scans might be useful in detecting COVID-19. Researchers found that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 symptoms have some visual marks like ground-glass opacities-hazy We collected a total of 1300 images from these two sources. We then resized all the images to the dimension of 224 x 224 pixels with a resolution of 72 dpi. Table II below shows the summary of the prepared dataset. The prepared dataset was then split into train and validation sets comprising of 80% and 20% of total data respectively.

CNN's have shown excellent performance on several applications such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition, natural language processing, and medical image analysis. Examples of chest x-ray images from prepared dataset Distribution of images for training and testing Convolutional neural networks are powering core of computer vision that has many applications which include self-driving cars, robotics, and treatments for the visually impaired. The main concept of CNN is to obtain local features from input (usually an image) at higher layers and combine them into more complex features at the lower layers[17] [18].A typical Convolutional Neural Network architecture consists of the following layers:a) Convolutional LayerConvolution layer is the core building block of a Convolutional Neural Network which uses convolution operation (represented by *) in place of general matrix multiplication. Its parameters consist of a set of learnable filters also known as kernels. The main task of the convolutional layer is to detect features found within local regions of the input image that are common throughout the dataset and mapping their appearance to a feature map.

These approaches still need rigorous testing and improvement before putting them in use. Subsequently, a large number of researchers and data scientists are working together to been very successful in various visual tasks which include medical image analysis as well. Deep learning has revolutionized automatic disease diagnosis and management by accurately analyzing, identifying, classifying patterns in medical images. The reason behind such success is that deep learning techniques do not rely on manual handcrafted features but these algorithms learn featuresThe proposed model is called CoroNet and will help us identifying the difference between three types of pneumonia infections and how Covid-19 is different from other infections. A model that can identify Covid-19 infection from chest radiography images can be very helpful to doctors in the triage, quantification and follow-up of positive cases. Even if this model does not completely replace the existing testing method, it can still be used to bring down the number of cases that need immediate testing or further review from experts. Therefore, we had to create a dataset by collecting chest x-ray images from two different publically available image databases. Covid-19 x-ray images are available at an open source Github repository by Joseph et al [15]. The repository contains an open database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images and is being updated regularly. At the time of writing this paper, the database contained around 290 Covid-19 chest radiography images. Pneumonia bacterial, Pneumonia viral and normal chest x-ray images were obtained from Kaggle repository \"Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)\" [16]. The dataset consists of 1203 normal, 660 bacterial Pneumonia and 931 viral Pneumonia cases.",

CoroNet which is trained on a dataset with slightly higher number of Covid-19 examples performed better than Covid-Net in terms of both accuracy as well as computational power. Covid-Net, with 116 million parameters achieved an accuracy of 83.5% while as our proposed model, CoroNet achieved an accuracy of 89.5% with just 33 million parameters (71% less parameters) which is a huge improvement in terms of computation. Thus, in comparison, CoroNet is much more efficient, provides good convergence and has highest performance accuracy.As the cases of Covid-19 pandemic are increasing daily, many countries are facing shortage of resources. During this health emergency, it is important that not even a single positive case goes unidentified.
