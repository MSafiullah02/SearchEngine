For example, the German Narcotics Act was revised in 1992 and clarified that substitution treatment for opioid dependence was legal. Since the early 1990s, substitution treatment has been the most important part of the treatment options for opioid dependence. The overall number of participants in drug-substitution treatment has risen over the past decade from about 1000 in the late 1980s to 65 000 in 2005. Although the MMT has been evaluated comprehensively in Germany with favorable outcomes, there is still a lack of availability of and accessibility to substitution treatment. In addition to opioids, the abuse of \"new\" types of drugs, including three, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and ketamine has spread recently in Germany. Drug abuse has caused many problems for both abusers and the community. In response, the Germany Cabinet adopted the \"Action Plan on Drugs and Addiction\"; the China Central government approved a similar regulation in the antidrug campaign in 2005.",

For economic, demographic, and humanitarian reasons, immigration has become an important issue for German society over the past 50 years; over 14 million people with a migrant background live in Germany today. They are either immigrants themselves or second generation immigrants. One of 5 marriages is binational and 1 of 4 children born in Germany has at least 1 foreign parent. One in 3 teenagers in West Germany has a migrant background, while in some areas, this is almost 40% and increasing. Immigration has substantially changed the constitution of Germany society; ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and religious diversity have for a long time been a living reality in Germany.",

Germany possesses an efficient society only if there is a high level of dynamism for innovation. Germany's overall economic infrastructure for basic and applied research is among the top nations for inventions. The German economy is more profound than other countries characterized by a clear weakness in growth. Unemployment figures remain high and a noticeable decline in employment subject to social insurance contributions leads to further gaps in the social security systems, thus contributing to their considerable financial problems.

The county-township-village 3-tier health-care system has contributed much to rural primary health care and has set an example of primary health care to developing nations. In the 1980s, this system experienced transformations along with changes of the country's administrative system and economic policy. The long-existing health administrative problems that were aggravated in the last decade are the rural-urban differences in resource allocation and the large proportion of people without health security. With the increase of medical service prices in recent years due to the inflation of the economy, it is believed that the cost of health care will create an economic burden to lowincome, fee-for-service paying individuals and will further affect the health of the population. In the process of the national economic reform, it is an important and difficult task for the health administrators to adjust the health-care system promptly and properly. Continuously carrying forward good traditions, correcting mistakes, and consistently persisting in health reforms can further raise its health care to a new, prosperous stage [1] .",

            "text": "Throughout history, Chinese governments have embarked on numerous campaigns to control opium. These attempts included the well-known Opium Wars [13, 14] . However, only 1 such attempt succeeded. In the early 1950s, the Chinese Government took a series of dramatic steps to combat widespread opium abuse, carrying out a nationwide antidrug campaign [13, 15] that included the following measures: (i) a circular order was issued by the new Government in 1950 mandating governments at all levels to fight opium abuse; (ii) those involved in the cultivation, manufacture, or sale of opium were subject to severe punishments, including forced labor and execution; (iii) compulsory \"treatment\" was instituted (consisting largely of enforced abstinence) for opium abusers combined with psychological \"rehabilitation\" and vocational training programs (involving forced labor); and (iv) the cultivation, manufacture, and use of medicinal opium was closely controlled to ensure medical use [16] . During the campaign, people involved in growing opium, transporting, or trafficking illegal drugs were punished. Labor camps and executions were among the measures employed. The campaign lasted 3 years from 1950 to 1952. According to official accounts, 20 million opium addicts were detoxified and returned to healthy, useful lives [13] . Some US authors celebrated the success of the Chinese Government's approach to the opium epidemic [17] . Official accounts, as well as some US authors, also claimed that the value system of young people had changed so that there was no new supply of addicts [17] . However, there were no rigorous epidemiological studies measuring the prevalence of opiate dependence before and after the campaign. Despite those serious limitations in our ability to rigorously evaluate how patterns of opiate use changed in the 1950s, it seems clear that the rates of dependence did decline precipitously, as the risks associated with the trade and use of opium climbed considerably. In addition, the availability of opium was curtailed dramatically by the aggressive eradication of opium planting and domestic manufacturing domestically and blocking international trafficking. China's political and economic isolation at that time was a key factor which excluded foreign supplies of opiates.",

Hao et al [7, 21] reported the prevalence, patterns, and trends of illicit drug use in the general population of selected highprevalence areas (Yunnan, Sichuan, Gansu, and Gungdong provinces) in China between 1993 and 2000. They screened more than 50 000 individuals aged 15 or above in the community and interviewed possible abusers. They found the lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use to be 1.08%, 1.60%, and 1.52% in consecutive surveys conducted in 1993, 1996, and 2000, respectively. The 1 year prevalence rates were 0.91%, 1.17%, and 1.17%, respectively. Heroin was the most common drug of abuse (51.8% in 1993, 83 Many reports have shown that the majority of addicts in China are young (30 years or younger), single (60%) males (60%-70%) with little education and without stable jobs [22] [23] [24] [25] . Routes of administration vary depending on geographic area and year of survey. Most studies conducted after 2000 showed that intravenous injection accounted for 50%-70% and \"chasing the dragon\" (zhui-long: ingestion of the drug by inhaling the vapor produced when the drug is heated to a level at which it sublimates) accounts for 25%-50% of opiate administration by users. The use of intravenous heroin is growing, with many users changing from zhui-long to the intravenous route. Finally, new drugs are now making their way into China, especially in urban areas where methamphetamine and other synthetic stimulants, as well as dissociative anesthetics, such as ketamine, are increasingly popular among young people [4, 24] .",

There are numerous potential drug interactions between antiretroviral medications and methadone and other substitute substances. Adaptations of the methadone dosage may be necessary. The analgesic properties of opioid may mask early symptoms of serious side-effects of HIV medications. A good relationship between doctor and patient is essential to deal with these problems. While in the past, IDU have usually been excluded from standard HCV therapy with interferon and ribavirin in Germany, recent results suggest a different approach [47] . Comparisons were made regarding the use of medication among drug users and non-drug users because of the following criteria: response rate, outcome of the HCV standard therapy, as well as the severity of neuropsychological side-effects [48] .",

More than 1 million people were diagnosed with HIV in 2003, bringing the total to 7.2 million infected people in the region [50, 51] . The growth of the epidemic in this area is largely due to the growing epidemic in China, in which 1 million people are living with HIV. China's AIDS epidemic began in the early 1990s among injecting heroin users [52, 53] . Injecting drug users account for more than half of China's HIV infections. In addition, many of China's sex workers inject drugs, and thus provide a bridge for HIV transmission to the general population [54] [55] [56] . As the commercial sex industry has exploded in China over the past 2 decades, HIV infection rates have also increased dramatically [52, 55] . By the end of 2003, the number of registered HIV infections was 62 159 (including 2693 cases of AIDS from which 1047 people died). An estimated 106 990 Chinese people were HIV positive by the end of 2004. HIV infections have been reported in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the actual number of cases and spread of infection is much likely to be greater [52, 53] . Drug abusers accounted for 63.7% of HIV cases. China is now one of the 6 South-East Asian countries in which there is growing ATS use, and vulnerability to HIV/AIDS appears to have increased [52, 57] . It is well known that AIDS affects not only patients, but also their families, society, and the economy. China's first law targeting the disease was passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in 2004. Discrimination against the victims of infectious diseases has also been outlawed. Many efforts and measures have been adopted by the Central Government to help patients obtain effective treatment. As for preventing HIV spread among drug addicts, some places in China, such as Guangzhou province, are instituting needle exchange programs among drug abusers in order to break the HIV-heroin connection. Some areas are also advocating 100% condom use among sex workers.",

Around half a million Chinese people die from hepatitis B because of hepatocellular carcinoma and endstage cirrhosis each year. A pilot study demonstrated that the HBsAg rate reached the adult level before the fifth year of age, and neonatal vaccination with either plasma-derived or recombinant hepatitis B vaccines provided a similar 75% protective efficacy against HBV infection. The high rate of follow up and blood test coverage of the cohorts provided data showing 75% protection at the tenth to eleventh year of age against serum HBsAg and against prolonged hepatic dysfunction. The strategy of controlling hepatitis B nationwide was based on the universal immunizations of newborns, beginning in cities and then rural areas. The large-scale vaccine source was provided by domestic plants through technology transfer, first providing plasma-derived vaccine that was replaced completely by recombinant DNA vaccine in 1997. An official survey in 1999 using a sample of 25 878 children from 31 provinces reported an average coverage rate of 70.7% using 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccination, and was found to be higher in urban areas. The Ministry of the Public Health of China has planned to integrate hepatitis B vaccination into the nationwide expanded program on immunization (EPI) program with Government-provided vaccines starting 1 January 2002 [58] .",

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the drug policy of German governments remained dominated by a rigid adherence to the abstinence paradigm. The therapeutic ideal of permanent abstinence for all opiate users was considered the only valid premise for providing practical survival support and the only valid criterion for successful addiction treatment. There was an overall predominance of drug-free therapy and therapeutic community (TC) was proclaimed as the \"royal road to recovery\". Until the early 1990s, methadone could only be administered to drug users when highly specific indication criteria were met (eg emergency cases, such as life-threatening conditions of withdrawal or conditions of severe pain). In general medical practice, however, German doctors were prevented from using methadone to treat heroin addicts, since MMT was considered medical malpractice. Nevertheless, there were a few general practitioners (GPs) who ignored the legal regulations and prescribed methadone to opiate addicts. The legal basis of substitution treatment was established in 2001 in the Narcotics Act and the Narcotic Drugs Prescription Ordinance. The substitution guidelines developed by the German Medical Association in 2002 are the technical basis for substitution treatment. They uphold abstinence from the substance of addiction as the prime treatment endpoint, whereby securing the individual's survival, stabilizing their health and social situation, and enabling their professional rehabilitation and social reintegration are considered preliminary stages within a comprehensive treatment concept. Substitution treatment also fulfils preventative functions, such as prevention of infectious diseases. Substitution treatment is supposed to be accompanied by psychotherapeutic and psychosocial measures [62, 64] . The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices keeps the substitution register on behalf of the Federal Laender. The tasks of the substitution register include, in particular, to prevent the multiple prescription of substitutes by several medical practitioners to 1 patient, checking compliance with the minimum requirements for the addiction therapy qualification of medical practitioners, and circulating statistical evaluations to the competent regulatory authorities and higher health authorities of the Laender. In 2002, 46 000 patients were recorded; the total number became 61 000. The number of physicians providing substitution treatment is currently around 2700. The most widely reported substitute is methadone. It is notable, however, that the proportion of buprenorphine has been rising over recent years [65, 66] .",

Only 6 of the 16 Federal states provide substitution treatment in prisons.

However, considerable moral objections persist over whether it is justifiable to supply drug-dependent people with an addictive substance for a prolonged period of time or for life at the tax payers' expense. On the other hand, high recidivism rates in short-term methadone treatment and drugfree forms of treatment highlight the need to introduce maintenance treatment. Insofar, it was only consistent that the Chinese Government should have decided to carry out pilot studies in particularly affected regions (Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Guangxi). The first results show that MMT leads to a reduction in injecting drug use and criminal behaviors as well as an improvement in social behavior. Some author [71, 72] advocate the combination of methadone treatment with motivating discussion techniques (motivational interviewing) and behavioral therapy elements to enhance retention rates and outcome.",

Implication of MMT in China An important factor for the success of the MMT is support from the municipality involved. This would also include training for the local political leadership. Moreover, the dropout rate in the Chinese programs is too high (30%-40%), and unfortunately, the good results in Beijing cannot be transferred to all provinces. In order to reduce the dropout rate requires training of clinic staff and in addition, training centers should be set up in all provinces affected. Another requirement is the regular exchange of experience among the clinics. Moreover, some clinics have problems in obtaining methadone. It is necessary to introduce ethical standards for treatment and to involve nursing staff more strongly. Experience in Hong Kong specifically indicates that nurses are vital and their work is more cost-effective. In addition, there is the need for easy access to clinics and additional psychosocial interventions, such as motivational interviewing. It is assumed that a positive, basic attitude of staff towards the program critically contributes to its success. Moreover, we should bear in mind that this is a long-term program. In Hong Kong, for instance, some patients have been attending this program for as long as 20 years, which is life-maintaining for them, even though they continue to take opiates.",

Germany approved the prescription of methadone [74] [75] [76] and legalized needle/syringe exchanges in the early 1990s [10] . More recently, the Federal Government legalized supervised injection sites and approved heroin trials [14, 15] . The Social Democrat/Green Party Coalition Government of Chancellor Schroeder, which came to power in 1998, established new national priorities and shifted responsibility for demand and harm reduction from the Home Office to the Ministry of Health. The Government also appointed a drug commissioner and established a multidisciplinary advisory body made up of experts from the field. The Drug Commissioner's reports address issues concerning both legal and illegal drugs and propose a greater focus on the social and health consequences of tobacco and alcohol use. The reports also emphasize that a variety of measures are needed to address legal and illegal drug problems, including increased public awareness, pilot projects, research, coordination with the Laender, and international cooperation.",

The length of drug treatment has a positive association with better post-treatment outcomes [78] . However, limited experience with MMT in China shows a high rate of dropouts. International studies have shown that motivational enhancement therapy or motivational interviewing enhances treatment initiation, retention, and outcomes in MMT program [79] , and adding behavioral intervention components into MMT programs increases abstinence and reduces HIV risk behaviors [80] . Policy-oriented operational research is needed in China to better understand how to increase the effectiveness of MMT and other harm reduction interventions in the Chinese context.",

The Central Government has given explicit support for harm reduction, as stated in the medium-and longterm strategic plan and the action plan. Some programs have been implemented successfully. However, in China, as in many other countries, public health and public security authorities frequently approach drug abuse from different perspectives, leading to conflicting approaches at local levels. The crackdown philosophy and detention of drug users in China reflect inconsistent interpretations of \"harm reduction\" and present a challenge to public health officials in implementing methadone substitution and needle-exchange programs [81] . Drug users may be reluctant to participate in these programs due to fear of being caught by police officers. It might be impossible to completely solve the dilemma in the near future, but this conflict is expected to gradually reduce for the following reasons. First, Chinese national policies for HIV prevention and control have become much more pragmatic in the past years. MMT and needle exchange programs were almost unimaginable several years ago, but now they are ready to be expanded across the country. We expect that the open policy trend will continue as the Chinese economy increasingly merges with international markets, and this trend will favor harm reduction programs. Furthermore, China's Central Government may achieve an advantage in promoting public health policies if these policies are believed to be correct. Second, inter-agency coordination on the public health crisis has been enhanced at both the central and local governmental levels since the SARS outbreak in 2003, which reduced the potential conflict of public health policies. Public health workers should provide policy advocacy to public security authorities and help them change their traditional norms about illicit drug control and obtain their support for harm reduction. Third, operational research is needed to provide evidence on the benefits of harm reduction programs and convince policy enforcers of the need for the revision of unfavorable policy components.",

Together with the service providers and self-help groups, they have succeeded over the past decades in making available a differentiated range of addiction and drug assistance offers that provide addicts in need of assistance with a broad spectrum of different services. Over the past 30 years in Germany, a high quality and differentiated treatment system has been developed in the area of addict assistance. This system comprises outreach and low-threshold forms of assistance, outpatient counseling and treatment offers, qualified withdrawal treatment, inpatient detoxification treatment with a subsequent adaptation phase and follow up, and post-inpatient care within the framework of integration (eg outpatient rehabilitation, special care housing, occupational rehabilitation projects, follow-up care, and self-help groups) [28, 82, 83] . These offers are supplemented by a medication-assisted outpatient treatment system especially for opiate addicts. Cooperation between the non-institution doctors and the addict-support system is to be promoted at the interface with acute medicine. The treatment aims are realistic and pragmatic and include the following aims:",
