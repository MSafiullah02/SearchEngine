            "text": "Numerous microorganisms produce lectins of different kinds that are specific for animal cell surface carbohydrates.1, 2 In viruses, the lectins occur as membrane constituents, in bacteria they are generally present on the cell surface, often as submicroscopic multisubunit surface appendages known as fimbriae or pili, and occasionally in intracellular soluble form, while in protozoa they are constituents of the cell envelope. Most of these lectins serve to tether the organisms to a substratum (e.g., soil bacteria to clays or marine bacteria to corals) in order to better access nutrients, escape deleterious agents, and withstand cleansing. In animals, they serve for the attachment (or adhesion) of the microorganisms to host tissues or cells, a prerequisite for infection, and are therefore among the virulence factors of the microorganisms. Detailed knowledge of the specificity and combining sites of these lectins is of importance not only for the understanding of a basic mechanism conserved throughout evolution, but also for the development of powerful inhibitors of the lectins for blocking microbial adhesion to tissues. This is the aim of antiadhesion therapy of microbial diseases.3, 4\n",

In general, millimolar affinity is observed for lectin binding to monosaccharides, although cases of lectins with micromolar affinities are known.7 When oligosaccharides act as ligands, corresponding to an extended binding site on the lectins, increased affinity up to the micromolar range can be observed. These interactions are typified by a favorable enthalpy term, due to the high number of hydrogen bonds that is offset by an unfavorable entropy contribution, attributed either to solvent rearrangement or loss of ligand conformational flexibility.",

The amino acids that form the combining sites are not necessarily contiguous, and are brought together in space by the folding of the polypeptide chain. Changes in the spatial position of the amino acid residues may occur upon binding of the carbohydrate, bringing them to an orientation which improves stereocomplementarity with the ligand. The fit between the binding site on the protein and the carbohydrate is also affected by the shape of the ligand. Oligosaccharides are flexible molecules with considerable freedom of rotation around the glycosidic bonds connecting the individual monosaccharide constituents. As a result, they may assume different shapes, only one of which may fit the combining sites.",

The hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein, with six N-linked oligosaccharides attached to HA1 and one to HA2. One of these glycans is an oligomannoside, while the others are complex bi- or triantennary structures, several of which contain sulfated galactose. X-ray crystallography showed that the hemagglutinin subunit consists of a hydrophilic, C-terminal domain, a hydrophobic membrane spanning region of 24\u201328 residues, an elongated triple-helical coiled stem, and a globular domain projecting 135 \u00c5 from the membrane. The globular domain consists of HA1 only, and contains the carbohydrate-binding site of the lectin. The subunits associate noncovalently to form trimers. The affinity of the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus for its receptor is downregulated by the two N-linked oligosaccharides attached to Asn123 and Asn129 in the vicinity of the combining site.25 Thus, a mutant hemagglutinin devoid of these oligosaccharides bound to human erythrocytes much more strongly than the native lectin.",

            "text": "Early sequence studies have shown that for the HAs of the H2 and H3 human viruses, a minimum of two changes in receptor-binding site amino acids, Gln226 to Leu226 and Gly228 to Ser228, correlate with the shift from avian to human receptor binding.26 By contrast, HAs of human H1 viruses acquire the ability to bind to human receptors while retaining Gln226 and Gly228. An understanding of how these changes occur, and a better insight into the combining sites of the HAs, have been provided by the recent study of John Skehel and co-workers of the structures of HAs from the 1918 pandemic virus (1918-human) with the use of HA expressed from the DNA recovered from tissues infected with virus in 1918 and from the prototype human (1934-human) and swine (1930-swine) H1 influenza viruses.27\n\u2022\nOverall structure and receptor binding subdomain. The overall trimeric structures of the HAs of the three H1 viruses (1918-human, 1934-human, and 1930-swine) HAs are similar (Figure 2\n), but they show notable differences to HAs of other subtypes with respect to the arrangements of the receptor-binding subdomain among others, both within the HA trimer and also within individual monomers. The receptor-binding sites are located as in other influenza A virus HAs at the membrane-distal tip of each subunit of the HA trimer. Three secondary structure elements, the 190 helix (residues 190\u2013198), the 130 loop (residues 135\u2013138), and the 220 loop (residues 221\u2013228), form the sides of each site, with the base made up of the conserved residues Tyr98, Trp153, His183, and Tyr195. The conformations adopted by the 130 and 220 loops of the three H1 HAs are similar, but they are significantly different from those of the equivalent loops in the HAs of other influenza subtypes (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4\n). As observed with other HAs, the terminal sialic acids of the human and avian receptors interact with binding site residues through a series of conserved hydrogen bonds to the carboxyl and amide of the sialic acid (Figure 3).\u2022\nThe 1934-human HA/human receptor complex. The electron density maps reveal well-ordered features for the Sia-1, Gal-2, and GlcNAc-3 of the sialopentasaccharide (the numbers in bold refer to the positions of the monosaccharides in the ligand) in this complex (Figure 3a). Gal-2 forms five hydrogen bonds that have not been previously observed in other HA/receptor complexes. Four bonds are possible between the 2- and 3-hydroxyls of Gal-2 and the side chains of Lys222 and Asp225, and a fifth between the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2 and the main-chain amide of 227 that is mediated by a water molecule.\u2022\nThe 1934-human HA/avian receptor complex. Again, only the Sia-1, Gal-2, and GlcNAc-3 moieties of the sialopentasaccharide are ordered in this complex (Figure 3b). This observation is consistent with the results of hemagglutination assays showing dual binding specificity for this HA. The side-chain carbonyl of Gln226 forms a hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2, as observed in other HA/avian receptor complexes. In addition, there is a previously unknown water-mediated interaction between the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2, the main-chain carbonyl of residue 225, and the side chain of Lys222 (Figure 3b).\u2022\nThe 1930-swine HA/human receptor complex. The sialic acid of the receptor is located similarly in the 1930-swine and 1934-human HA receptor binding sites, but in the 1930 swine complex all five saccharides of the receptor analog are detected (Figure 3c). Lys222 again forms hydrogen bonds with the 2- and 3-hydroxyls of Gal-2, although in the present case this residue sits higher in the binding site. Asp190 hydrogen bonds to the amino nitrogen of GlcNAc-3, Ser193 hydrogen bonds to the 2-hydroxyl of Gal-4, and there is a water-mediated interaction between Thr189 and GlcNAc-5. The last three interactions have not been observed before in HA receptor complexes. In addition, the sialopentasaccharide exits the binding site in an orientation not previously seen, crossing the 190 helix near its N-terminus, about parallel to the threefold symmetry axis of the HA trimer.\u2022\nThe 1930-swine HA/avian receptor complex. The electron density for the avian receptor analog bound to the 1930-swine HA is weak and mainly represents the sialic acid moiety (Figure 3d). A similar situation was observed for an H5 avian HA in complex with a human receptor analog, where only a subset of the atoms for the sialic acid could be located. These observations probably reflect the low affinity of the HAs for their respective ligands, consistent with the preference of the 1930-swine virus for human receptor in hemagglutination assays.\u2022\nHuman receptor complexes. Complexes of the human receptor analog bound to 1934-human HA (green) and 1930-swine HA (blue) and to human H3 HA (red) are superimposed in Figure 4a. Perhaps the most important feature of this comparison is the difference in structure adopted by the 130 and 220 loops of the receptor-binding site between the H1 and H3 HAs. One consequence of the change in the 130-loop structure is that the sialic acid of the receptor is tilted about 10 \u00b0 into the receptor-binding sites of the H1 HAs. This effect, together with different orientations about the glycosidic bond, contributes to Gal-2 being located almost 2 \u00c5 lower in the H1 HAs than in the human H3 HAs. Gal-2 is able to adopt this position because structural differences in the 220 loop locate Gln226 lower in the binding site than the equivalent Leu226 of human H3 HA. Consequently, in the H1 HAs, Gal-2 is located closer to the 220 loop and is able to form hydrogen bonds with Lys222. In the case of the 1934-human HA, Gal-2 also interacts with Asp225. Thus, a combination of factors relating to the structure of the 130 and 220 loops enable the H1 HAs to make favorable hydrogen bond interactions with Gal-2 of the human receptor. Gln226 plays an essentially passive role in this process, in marked contrast to the role played by Leu226 in the binding of human H3 HA to human receptor. In that case, Gal-2 makes hydrophobic contacts with Leu226, and the higher position and the nature of this side chain are important for human receptor binding.\u2022\nAvian receptor complexes. Complexes of avian receptor analogs with 1934-human HA (green), 1930-swine HA (blue), and an avian H3 HA (red) are overlaid in Figure 4b. Again, the differences in the structure of the 130 loop between the H1 and H3 HAs result in the sialic acid of the avian receptor being located lower in the receptor binding site of the H1 HAs. Comparison of the 1934-human and avian H3 complexes also reveals that Gal-2 of the avian receptor is located about 1 \u00c5 lower in the binding site of the H1 complex, as is Gln226. In both complexes, the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2 hydrogen bonds with the side-chain carbonyl of Gln226 (Figure 4b), and the coordinated differences in position of the bound receptor and Gln226 enable this interaction to be conserved.

It has been suggested that the 1930-swine HA binds less effectively to avian receptors than the 1934-human HA because the position adopted by Gln226 in 1934-human HA is about 1 \u00c5 higher in its complex with the avian receptor than it is either in the human receptor complex or in the uncomplexed form (Figure 5\n). By contrast, the position of Gln226 in 1930-swine HA is about the same as uncomplexed and in the human and avian receptor complexes. The apparent inability of Gln226 to adopt a higher position in the receptor-binding site seems to explain the failure of 1930-swine HA to interact as effectively with the avian receptor. This explanation is supported by the structural observation that in the 1934-human HA complex with avian receptor Glu190 interacts through two water molecules with Gln226 (Figure 5). This network of hydrogen bonds may be necessary to position Gln226 in the binding site for its interaction with Gal-2. Glu190 is conserved in avian H1 HAs, all of which specifically bind \u03b12-3-linked receptors. By contrast, residue 190 of 1930-swine HA is an aspartic acid, which does not interact with either the 9-hydroxyl of Sia-1 or Gln226 and is thus unable to facilitate binding to avian receptor.",

The importance of this requirement was emphasized in the 1997 outbreak of H5 \u2018chicken\u2019 influenza in Hong Kong, when the virus was extremely virulent but did not acquire the ability to bind 2-6-linked sialosides and was therefore unable to spread. With the ability to ensure the efficiency of the initial stages of virus infection, coupled with novel antigenicity, the human-1918 HA may have been the prime determinant of extensive mortality in the 1918 pandemic.",

This conformation was presumed not to be representative of natural receptors because of the presence of glucose rather than N-acetylglucosamine at position 3 and the lack of glycosylation beyond this position. The mode of Sia2-6Lac binding, however, further demonstrates the plasticity of the HA receptor binding site in accommodating oligosaccharides in different conformations. By contrast, Sia2-6Lac binds in a manner very similar to that of the pentasaccharide, LSTa, again suggesting that there is no role in avian receptor binding for the saccharides beyond GlcNAc-3. It is therefore possible that some avian HAs are capable of binding sialic acid in \u03b12-6 linkage to galactose, but are not capable of infecting humans because the saccharides beyond GlcNAc-3 sterically clash with the HA. For an avian HA to change its binding specificity from avian to human receptors may therefore involve two sorts of changes, the first, to allow binding of the \u03b12-6-linkage, either via mutation of Gln226 to Leu226 as in H2 and H3 HAs or via a specific positioning of Gln226 as in H1, and the second, to accommodate the additional saccharides linked to Gal-2 in the natural receptor side chain.",

The critical difference in the structure of the viral protein (VP1) that contains the carbohydrate-binding site of these strains is in residue 91, which is glycine in the poorly tumorogenic strains and glutamic acid in the highly tumorogenic ones.33 Crystallographic studies at low resolution of the intact poorly tumorogenic virus particle in complex with Sia2-3Lac34 and with a branched hexasaccharide containing both \u03b12-3- and \u03b12-6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid35, 36 have located the combining site in a shallow groove and have shown that the sialic acid as well as the galactose form contacts with the protein (Figure 11\n). The inability of the highly tumorogenic strains to bind the branched ligand is due to electrostatic repulsion between the side chain of Glu91 and the carboxylate of the \u03b12-6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid. These results have been confirmed and extended in a high-resolution crystallographic study of a pentamer of VP1 from the poorly tumorogenic virus in complex with the above pentasaccharide.32\n",

The affinity of different phenotypes of E. coli type 1 or of the isolated fimbriae to mannose or Me\u03b1Man may differ within a factor of 15 and they can be functionally subdivided into either low-mannose-binding (M1L) or high-mannose-binding (M1H) phenotypes.43\nE. coli exhibiting these two basic phenotypes have been found to predominate in different niches. Most isolates from the large intestine of healthy humans (c. 80%) express a distinct M1L phenotype, whereas most isolates from urinary tract infections (>70%) express M1H variants. These naturally occurring variations dramatically change the tissue tropism of E. coli and can be a major factor in shifting the bacterial adaptation from commensal to pathologic habitats, a phenomenon known as pathoadaptation.44 Typically, type 1 fimbriae of E. coli have a considerably higher affinity (up to 40 times as compared to mannose) for oligosaccharides such as Man\u03b13Man\u03b24GlcNAc or Man\u03b16(Man\u03b13)Man\u03b16(Man\u03b13)Man that are constituents of cell surface glycoproteins.45\n",

With several Salmonella species examined, aromatic \u03b1-mannosides, as well as the trisaccharide Man\u03b12Man\u03b24GlcNAc, were weaker inhibitors than Me\u03b1Man. The combining site of Salmonella species appears thus to be smaller than that of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and to be devoid of an adjoining hydrophobic region. Different combining sites were found in other mannose-specific bacterial lectins. Therefore, although classified together on the basis of their monosaccharide (primary) specificity, these lectins differ in their fine specificity. Swapping experiments with genetically engineered hybrid fimbriae, in which the FimH of one species (e.g., E. coli) was presented on the shaft of the other species (K. pneumoniae), have shown that the shaft plays a role in modulating the specificity of fimbriae, probably by imposing conformational constraints on the carbohydrate-binding subunit.55\n",

One of these, located in the N-terminal half of the subunit (residues 1\u2013156), is the lectin domain, with the mannose-binding site at its tip. The C-terminal half (residues 160\u2013279), known as the pilin domain, serves to anchor the subunit to the fimbriae. It binds in the cleft of FimC, although there is only limited contact between FimH and the C-terminal domain of the chaperone. The carbohydrate recognition domain of FimH is an 11-stranded elongated \u03b2-barrel with a jellyroll-like topology, while the pilin domain has an immunoglobulin fold that lacks the seventh (C-terminal) \u03b2-strand present in the canonical immunoglobulin fold. In the FimC\u2013FimH complex, the missing \u03b2-strand is donated by the seventh strand of the N-terminal domain of the chaperone to complete the immunoglobulin-like fold of FimH. This kind of \u2018donor strand complementation\u2019 is thought to initiate folding of FimH directly on the chaperone, thus accounting for the function of the latter in biogenesis of the fimbriae.57\n",

It is buried at a deep and negatively charged site at the edge of FimH, opposite to the region through which the latter combines with the chaperone. All the mannose hydroxyls, except the anomeric one, interacted extensively with combining site residues, almost all of which are situated at the ends of \u03b2-strands or in the loops extending from them. Part of the hydrogen-bonding network is identical to that found in mannose complexes of other lectins. Thus, Asp54 makes cooperative hydrogen bonds with the 4- and 6-OH and Asn140 with the 3- and 4-OH of the ligand, similar to those made by the equivalent residues with the same sugar in the combining sites of legume lectins with the same primary specificity.59 In addition, the N-terminal amine of the FimH polypeptide is H-bonded to the 2-OH, 6-OH, and the ring oxygen of the mannose.58 This is one of the rare cases in which an N-terminal amine of a protein participates in ligand binding. Phe142 of FimH interacts hydrophobically with the C2\u2013C3 bond of the mannose. The same residue, together with Ile13, Tyr 48, and Ile52, form part of a hydrophobic ridge that surrounds the site and which may help to direct the ligand into it. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that combining site residues Asp54, Gln133, Asn135, and Asp140 are essential for carbohydrate binding by FimH, since their replacement by alanine, asparagine, or aspartic acid resulted in complete loss of this activity.",

Bacteria expressing the monovalent hybrid FimH were capable of binding strongly to uroepithelial tissue culture cells and guinea pig erythrocytes. They could not, however, agglutinate yeasts or bind human buccal cells, functions readily accomplished by the E. coli expressing mannotriose-specific FimH variants. Based on the relative potency of inhibitory compounds of different structures, it was concluded that the receptor-binding site within the monovalent FimH\u2013FocH subunit has an extended structure with an overall configuration similar to that within the multivalent FimH of natural origin.",

The subunit of the fucose- and mannose-specific PA-IIL, also a tetramer, is similar in size to that of PA-IL, but its primary structure is different.69 The activities of both proteins are dependent upon the presence of divalent cations. The Pseudomonas-soluble lectins are found mainly in the bacterial cytoplasm. They are released by a subpopulation of the bacterial cells and serve to tether the bacteria to a substratum by binding to ill-defined structures on the bacterial surface and to a receptor on animal cells that contain the corresponding sugar.",

The fact that two of the oligosaccharides can be completely visualized is due the rigidity of their linear part resulting from fortuitous crystal packing that generates extensive contacts between two adjacent sugars centered on a pseudo twofold axis of symmetry (Figure 28c). It is this interaction that allows the very high-resolution structure of milk pentasaccharide to be described here for the first time. The protein-binding site, together with the calcium ions and fucose moiety, are identical with those described previously. Additional interactions with the protein surface are established by the glucose and galactose residues of the Lex glucose analog moiety (Figure 28b). The glucose establishes a direct hydrogen bond between its hydroxyl group at position 2 and the side chain of Asp-96. In addition, five interactions are mediated by a water molecule, involving O1 of fucose, O1 and O6 of glucose, and O1, O2, and O6 of galactose. Hydrophobic interactions are observed for the methyl group of fucose, but also for C6 of galactose, which interacts with the carbon of a glycerol molecule located at the protein surface. The other part of the pentasaccharide, that is, the Glc\u03b24GlcNAc linked to position 3 of galactose, does not interact with the protein surface, but instead is involved in extensive interactions with the neighboring carbohydrate in the crystal lattice (Figure 28c).",

They do not seem to be related evolutionarily, even though they both adopt a jellyroll fold and they both use calcium for carbohydrate binding. In PA-IL, calcium, together with a unique network of hydrogen bonds, generates a binding site endowed with a selective specificity for galactose. In contrast, in PA-IIL, the two calcium ions are associated with a very high affinity (micromolar range) and a wide specificity for binding different monosaccharides. The occurrence of metal ions in lectins is well known. Carbohydrate binding by legume lectins depends on the presence of manganese and calcium ions, whose main role is to maintain the architecture of the binding site and not to make contacts with the sugar ligand. Direct calcium\u2013sugar interactions have been observed in only two families of animal lectins: pentraxins and C-type lectins. The first family includes serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which contain two close calcium ions involved in binding of diverse ligands. The lectin activity of SAP differs from that of PA-IIL, since it is only directed to sulfated or phosphorylated carbohydrates. Despite the lack of sequence or fold similarity, the galactose-binding mode of PA-IL shows a striking resemblance to those of two C-type animal lectins complexed with galactose, that is, the QPDWG mutant of rat mannose-binding protein A and the tunicate galactose-specific C-type lectin, TC14, from Polyandrocarpa misakiens.7, 78 Nevertheless, in PA-IL, the occurrence of an additional strong interaction with the galactose O6 group can explain the 10-fold higher galactose affinity compared to that of the C-type animal lectins.",

The lectin has been crystallized with Me\u03b1Fuc and with the highest-affinity ligand 2-fucosyllactose. The X-ray crystal structure of the RSL-Me\u03b1Fuc complex revealed that each monomer consists of two small four-stranded antiparallel sheets (Figure 29\n). Trimerization through a threefold or pseudo-threefold axis generates a six-bladed \u03b2-propeller architecture, very similar to that previously described for the fungal lectin of Aleuria aurantia.
