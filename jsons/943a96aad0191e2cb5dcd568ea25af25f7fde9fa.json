The most immunodominant protein VP1 in the capsid of PSVs is used for estimating the divergence among the strains. Though only a single type of PSV-1 is present, fewer similarities are observed between PSV strains from different geographical regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on VP1 gene sequences shows that PSVs are distributed in different clusters depending upon the country of origin. Both full-length (855 bp) and partial-length (544 bp) VP1 genes have been used for the analysis of PSV diversity. The analysis based on VP1 sequences by SplitsTree4 software segregates three species within the genus Sapelovirus (Fig. 14. 3) in three different clusters. Variations within PSV isolates are quite evident that indicates that several PSVs are circulating all over the world, and they are different from each other based on VP1 sequence.
