They are the causative agents of a severe, mostly lethal, haemorraghic fever in humans, with occasional epidemic outbreaks of the disease in regions of central Africa [1]. Filoviruses are enveloped by a lipid bilayer, which anchors the glycoprotein GP to the surface of viral particles. GP undergoes a number of posttranslational modifications, which have been associated with virus entry and possibly pathogenicity 2, 3. The matrix protein VP40 forms a layer underneath the viral membrane and provides a link to the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) composed of the viral RNA packaged by the nucleoprotein (NP) as well as the associated proteins VP35, VP30, and polymerase L 4, 5, 6, 7. The mature viral particles have a filamentous shape, which varies in length 4, 8.",

The ring structures are composed of four dimeric antiparallel \u03b2 sandwich domains (Figure 1A). Each domain contains six antiparallel \u03b2 strands forming two sheets and three \u03b1 helices that pack laterally against the \u03b2 structure. The ring structure has an outer diameter of \u223c84 \u00c5 and an inner diameter of \u223c17 \u00c5 (Figure 1B); the width of the particle is \u223c42 \u00c5 (Figures 1C). In each monomer, the C-terminal ends (residues 184 to 194) reach over to the neighboring monomer, which contacts them in an extended conformation. This arrangement leads to the positioning of the C-terminal ends at the outer side of the ring, pointing away from it, almost at the same horizontal level and only 15 \u00c5 apart (Figure 1C). This suggests that the C-terminal domains, which were not present in the construct, could be positioned at the side, above or below the ring. The structure lacks \u223c70 residues at the N terminus and its N-terminal end is positioned at the outside of the ring, close to the C-terminal end (Pro 185) (Figure 1B). Each monomer binds a short stretch of RNA at the dimer-dimer interface, characterized by excellent electron density for a triribonucleotide (Figure 1D).",

In addition, no dimeric form of VP40 can be detected in infected cells under either separation condition. This strongly indicates, together with the RNA binding properties of full-length oligomeric VP40 in vitro, that octameric VP40 bound to a specific RNA sequence plays a role in the virus life cycle. We then analyzed purified Ebola virus particles to determine whether octameric VP40 in complex with RNA is part of the virus particle. Separation of samples under boiled and nonboiled conditions produced mostly monomers and a band corresponding to dimers of VP40. However, no high molecular weight band corresponding to the SDS-resistant form detected in virus-infected cells could be detected, indicating that octameric VP40 might not be abundantly present in virus particles (Figure 5C).",

The structure shows that VP40 has to undergo two major conformational changes in order to allow the observed oligomerization. This involves the movement of the C-terminal domain, which had been suggested earlier [11], as well as the displacement of the N-terminal region (residues 31 to 70), which then generates the binding pocket for the specific recognition of the ssRNA motif U-G-A. Indeed, the octamer structure shows that the interface of the dimeric subunit is similar to the interface occupied by the N- and C-terminal domains in the closed conformation.",

As reported for many protein/RNA complexes, adenine is coordinated by recognition of its N1 and N6 groups and the recognition of guanine involves arginines, a role that is fulfilled by Arg134 [30]. Phe125 and Arg134 are the most important residues in the interaction and both are positioned next to each other and exposed close to the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains in the monomeric conformation (see Figure 5C in [9]), which might implicate them in the transition process. Uracil at the 5\u2032 end is less well fixed by protein-RNA interactions; however, it is still unambiguously defined by electron density and well coordinated by stacking against hydrophobic residues Leu132 and Leu158 as well as a symmetry-related uracil group, including polar interactions between neighboring uridines. Interestingly, all polar residues involved in the protein-RNA interaction are strictly conserved and all hydrophobic residues are either conserved, such as Phe125, or substituted by conservative changes among all available sequences from Ebola virus subtypes (Zaire, Reston) and Marburg virus strains (Musoke and Popp). We propose that this conservation is significant (34% identity between Ebola [Zaire] and Marburg [Popp] VP40 NTDs), and it indicates that Marburg virus VP40 may also interact specifically with nucleic acids.",

The general function of binding multiple RNA copies could be as simple as concentrating multiple copies at specific sites. In case of VP40, the binding of the RNA seems to follow an induced fit pathway, as suggested for general RNA-protein recognition [36], which evolved to accommodate multiple functions within a single polypeptide chain by creating a symmetric homo-oligomer.

It might have a role in RNP formation as described for a number of matrix proteins 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, although recent evidence would not directly support such a role [7]. On the other hand, it might be in agreement with the detection of viral RNPs associated with VP40 in inclusions of Marburg virus-infected cells [20]. Other potential interactions besides those with the viral genome may involve filovirus mRNAs containing the triribonucleotide sequence [39], and such complexes may function in transcription or translation control. Lastly, we cannot exclude the possibility that the bound (cellular or viral) RNA acts solely as an adaptor in order to generate a conformation of VP40 suitable to interact with an unknown regulatory protein, active in the virus life cycle.",

As the limiting size of a viral genome to be packaged into virus particles leads to evolutionary pressure to increase the coding content of the genome without changing its size, several conformations of VP40 will therefore allow the matrix protein to exert multiple tasks. We provide evidence that the RNA bound form of octameric VP40 is not an abundant component of the assembled particle, as its SDS-resistant form is only found in infected cells and not in mature viral particles. It is therefore most likely involved in a yet unknown regulatory step during the life cycle of the virus. Our data also suggest that Marburg viruses employ a similar strategy, as all residues involved in RNA interaction are conserved between Ebola and Marburg virus strains. The octamer structure of VP40 now provides the framework for a precise functional analysis. In addition, the presence of the octameric form of VP40 in infected cells together with the well-defined RNA binding pocket may render VP40 a new target for antiviral drug development.",
