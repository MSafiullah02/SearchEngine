            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease which continues to affect modern society with a quarter of the world believed to have active or latent TB, primarily in low and middle income countries1,2. TB is transmitted by aerosol inhalation of the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) from an infected individual. During the course of infection, a wide variety of pulmonary disease lesion presentations may concurrently present within the same host3\u20135. This pulmonary pathology includes, but is not limited to, inflammatory lesions, interstitial pneumonia, necrotic caseating granulomas encapsulated within a fibrotic rim, non-cavitary necrotic lesions, non-necrotic cellular lesions, and cavitary lesions6,7. The heterogeneity of lesions within a single individual represent a myriad of microenvironments for Mtb that range from hypoxic regions where bacteria are extracellular in caseum, to vascularized and more aerated regions where Mtb is intracellular within various macrophage populations8,9. Because of the complex environments that develop in the lung throughout infection, Mtb has developed adaptive strategies to alter its metabolism and replicative state in order to increase survival10\u201313. The adaptation of Mtb to its environment results in bacterial populations exhibiting multiple distinct phenotypes8,14. A critical component in understanding disease outcome and, importantly, treatment success is our understanding of these varying lesion microenvironments and bacterial phenotypes15\u201317. Two important clinical implications emerge from the lesion heterogeneity observed in lungs of TB patients in terms of the effectiveness of drug treatment in the various lesion types and lesion compartments. Lesion characteristics differentially affect (1) drug penetration and distribution of TB drugs inside the lung lesions where the bacteria are located18, and (2) the relative drug susceptibility of the bacilli contained within these lesions due to metabolic adaptation that could induce phenotypic drug tolerance and bacterial persistence8,19. These combined factors result in marked inter- and intra-lesional variability of drug-mediated killing. We have reported previously on the C3HeB/FeJ mouse model, which after Mtb aerosol infection, develops a heterogeneity of pulmonary lesion types more reflective of the lung pathology seen in TB patients, and which has proven useful to further our understanding of disease progression as well as studying treatment responses for emerging therapies13,20\u201323.",

            "text": "Murine models are employed in TB research due to their small size and low cost, and in addition, their physiology and genetics are well understood. Standard laboratory mouse strains such as C57BL/6 and Balb/c, have been used most widely for TB research. However, these mouse strains show limitations by solely developing a single lesion type after Mtb infection and they lack the lesion heterogeneity seen in TB patients. The C3HeB/FeJ TB infection model presents with a heterogeneity of pulmonary lesion types more reflective of human disease20,21. This mouse model was first described for tuberculosis by Igor Kramnik et al. (and is therefore also more commonly referred to as \u201cthe Kramnik mouse model\u201d)24. These mice developed a de novo recessive allele, identified in a region at the 54.0-cM location of chromosome 1, termed the \u2018super susceptibility to tuberculosis -1\u2019 locus (sst1)25. The susceptible sst1 allele was reported to control the formation of caseous necrosis of pulmonary lesions. In C3HeB/FeJ mice after an Mtb infection with a low inoculum, the bacterial load increases to high bacterial numbers in lungs, and mice develop a chronic disease state with a dramatic progression of the lung pathology over time. After 8 weeks post infection, three pulmonary lesion types can be identified which we classified earlier20,21, as: (i) a highly organized encapsulated caseous necrotic granuloma defined as a Type I lesion, (ii) a neutrophil dominated lesion with cellular necrosis defined as a Type II lesion, and (iii) cellular lesions with distinct clusters of lymphocytes defined as a Type III lesion type. Both the Type I and II lesion types contain high bacterial numbers (up to 106-7 per lesion), whereas the smaller Type III lesions only show few bacteria (up to 102-3 per lesion). All three lesions types can be present at the same time within a single mouse, and even in a single lung lobe21. Occasionally cavities have been observed, although this has been an infrequent event in the C3HeB/FeJ mouse model infected with Mtb H37Rv or Erdman20,26.",

The quantification of lung involvement in disease has proven to be informative as a secondary readout. A thorough pathology assessment can be informative to assess the effect of the therapeutic intervention on the disease itself, by studying improvement or worsening of inflammation or measures of tissue repair, such as fibrosis, as well as revealing potential immunotoxicities. Serial positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans of M. tuberculosis-infected animals and TB patients have been used to monitor disease progression and response to treatment31\u201333, allowing precise quantitation of the extent of disease and inflammatory response of the host. Parallel studies of cynomolgus macaques and humans have shown comparable rates of radiological response to linezolid34, and based on these initial studies, radiographic surrogate markers are being actively explored for use in human clinical trials of new agents and TB regimens35\u201337. For mouse models used in preclinical testing for TB, the treatment effect on pulmonary pathology is generally examined on microscopic images using a histological grading system by a veterinary pathologist specialized in TB38. The pathologist then assesses both macroscopic recognition of larger pathologic structures such as lesion types, as well as microscopic identification of predominate immune cell types. Because of the complex nature of the classification process, quantification of the lesions and their lung involvement for research purposes is not only a specialized task but highly time-consuming and variable upon the individual performing the analysis. The person-to-person variability and subject nature of the method can lead to differing results, and this will in addition make inter-experiment comparisons of the histopathology results difficult. The manual time-consuming analysis can lead to increased user fatigue and reduced focus, which in itself can lead to introduction of more inaccuracies.",

After an image is uploaded, the Type I object detector (CNN1) is used to macroscopically detect the caseous necrotic center of Type I lesions (Figs. 1,2). LIRAs CNN1, the Type I object detector, showed to be consistent in identifying and delineating Type I lesion structures, with a sensitivity of 86.36%. CNN1 however shows a high false positive rate by misclassifying other lesion types for a Type I with the specificity of 55.11%. Most misclassifications occurred when large areas of cellular necrosis were visible in the center of Type II lesions, which on a single image patch shows a similar cellular composition as the Type I cores. The high recall rate is likely the result of the training set for the creation of CNN1, having an insufficient number of images needed for training. To decrease the false positive rate for CNN1, continued training with a larger training set might be an area of improvement for future iterations. Despite the high recall rate, we opted to retain CNN1 as it facilitated the rapid identification of Type I lesions for the user, and it provided an accurate demarcation of its margins from surrounding lesions or tissue. For instance, the validation results showed that the inclusion of CNN1 decreased the inconsistencies seen after hand labeling among multiple pathologists in identifying and demarcation of the Type I Rim. However, it is possible that repeated false positive results could sway the less experienced user to misclassify over time. Therefore extra scrutiny is needed during the CNN1 step to limit potential bias of less experienced users which could lead to an increase of the number of false positives. Overall, the addition of CNN1 proved to be a substantial time saver as more time is allocated to accurately identify the margins of the Type I lesions than in the removal of a potential misclassification.",

Also, minor differences in the staining procedure of the microscope slides affected the intensity and colors of the tissue and its images, which resulted in slight differences in classification by LIRA.

The goal for this validation step was to compare the pathology classification results from the classical pathology analysis approach of four pathologists or four research technicians, to the prediction results of LIRA with pathologist assistance (see Supplemental Fig. 1). The comparison focused on three criteria: (1) the accuracy of both approaches in identifying the correct pathology classification; (2) the accuracy of demarcation of lesion margins that affects the area of lung involvement, and (3) the variability between users. For this purpose, the pathologists were first given seven images to classify each image patch by hand. After one week, the pathologists used the same seven digital images in a random order to classify each image patch now with the assistance of LIRA. Using the classical pathology approach, results of the four pathologists showed a consensus on the specific lesion classification in general, but did not always agree on the extent of the percent lung involvement (Supplemental Fig. 2). The disease classification categories with the most variability in results were Type I Rim and Type II lesion types, which subsequently also impacted indirectly the Healthy tissue classification. The variation in results within these categories was mostly the result of inaccurate demarcation of lesion margins after manual labeling by the pathologists. Specific examples detailing the high variability for each of these classifications are presented in Fig. 3 and Supplemental Figs. 1 & 2.",

An example of this can be observed in Supplemental Fig. 2 (Image 3), which consists of one Type I and multiple Type III lesions. In this example for the pathologist-only readout, an observed disagreement was seen for the demarcation of the Type I Rim and the start of the Type III lesion that is adjacent to it. Only one of the four pathologists (pathologist 2) had accurately identified neutrophil-rich regions of the Type III lesion (in green), which is an unusual event for a Type III lesion. For the pathologist-assisted LIRA results (Supplemental Fig. 2), three out of four pathologists decided to reduce the lung area for the Type I lesion after being prompted by LIRA. In addition, all four pathologists recognized regions of neutrophil infiltration only after the assistance of LIRA (in green). Another disagreement between pathologists was observed regarding the classification of bronchial airways and artifacts. For the pathologist-only readout, two out of four pathologists classified the bronchial airways as Healthy tissue, and the two remaining pathologists classified these regions as Empty slide. The same was observed for a tissue processing artifact visible on the image scan (a fragment hole artifact), which was classified by two pathologists as Healthy tissue and by the other two as Empty slide. With the assistance of LIRA, the results for all four pathologists were now in agreement, and both the bronchial airways and the artifact were classified correctly as Empty slide. The change in classification that occurred at the pathologists\u2019 checkpoints after CNN2 and CNN3 showed to have a significant impact on the output data in terms of reducing the variability and increasing reproducibility of the results.",

First, the use of the LIRA software increased the accuracy of the demarcation of lesion margins, which affected indirectly the percent lung involvement in various categories. In addition, LIRA prompted the pathologist to revisit and re-analyze specific areas in the lungs, often small in size, which were often overlooked using the classical histopathology approach. Examples are shown in Fig. 3 (Pathologist 1, Pathologist 1 + LIRA) and Fig. 4 (Images 6 & 7), which show the improvement of lesion margin demarcation with LIRA assistance. With the use of LIRA, the classification of the pathological features not only improved the agreement between pathologists, but the results tended to be closer to the predictions made by the most experienced TB pathologist (Pathologist 4) (Supplemental Fig. 1). An example where LIRA prompted the user to re-analyze their initial prediction is shown in Fig. 3D. Here, a large area of fibrotic tissue is observed, which should have been classified as miscellaneous as it does not fit any other definition. With the assistance of LIRA, the pathologist changed the classification to miscellaneous, which was in agreement with the other three pathologists. The accuracy of classifying image features in the miscellaneous category is mostly dependent on the background and level of expertise of the user, and therefore this category will always be the most difficult to fully standardize across multiple users. The assistance of LIRA in the miscellaneous category, however, did minimize the misclassifications in this category and was an added benefit.",

Specific scoring criteria are developed which can distinguish between various disease states thereby informing about disease progression or on effects of treatment intervention. These scoring criteria are then applied in double-blind histopathology analysis to reduce bias and variability. However, issues such as reproducibility between studies and variability in readouts by different pathologists still exist, and this continues to be an area of active research61,62. In non-clinical TB animal studies used in drug and vaccine development, studies are often long term, require multiple time points, and generally occur in more than one laboratory to confirm that novel treatments or interventions are reproducibly efficacious. To evaluate the progression of pulmonary lesions in TB animal models, a histological grading system was developed years ago, based on grading granulomatous lesions for inflammatory cell numbers and their infiltrative distribution pattern38. The pathologist would then calculate a mean total lesion score for individual tissues; as normal (score of 1), mild (score: 1\u20133), moderate (score: 3\u20136), severe (score: 6\u20138) to reflect the disease state per animal. The variability in histopathology analysis between studies, time points, and individual pathologists, owing to the subjective nature of this method, was often substantial thereby making it difficult to interpret results. In addition, studies would be time-consuming and results over time affected by user fatigue. In this report, we describe the development of novel software for a rapid automated and unbiased digital image analysis using a machine learning approach based on convolutional neural networks to evaluate the histopathology of mouse models for tuberculosis in a quantitative manner. The goal was to make the software intuitive for its user, as well as facilitate and accelerate histopathology analysis for the non-expert.",

The model uses human classifications to learn robust features from a large number of H&E stained image patches. The model is currently suitable for quantitative lesion identification of the C3HeB/FeJ mouse model for tuberculosis. Initial attempts tried to implement a single convolutional neural network to identify all seven histopathology classifications. However, significant misclassification was observed caused by observing similar cell compositions in more than one lesion type. Therefore, LIRA was created using three individual neural networks to create a single modular network in order to generate more accurate predictions, based on both macroscopic- and microscopic histopathology events. Currently, the accuracy of the model is not sufficient to rely solely on the implementation of the LIRA software without any human intervention. Two human intervention checkpoints for the user are still required: first, to confirm and potentially modify the Type I lesion prediction (CNN1) and second, to confirm the individual image patch classifications made by LIRA (CNN2, CNN3). Moreover, human intervention can help prevent the misclassification of infrequent pathology events and artifacts on which the specific CNN had not previously been trained. Noteworthy, certain misclassifications by LIRA may ultimately be beneficial to the process as they can bring a particular pathology feature to the attention of the user, and can prompt the researcher for closer analysis. Future iterations will focus to improve the model by including additional datasets for training when more studies become available to increase LIRA\u2019s performance under all circumstances.",

First, we observed a significant reduction in analysis time and user-fatigue whereby an 82% decrease in time was achieved for quantitative analysis in comparison to the standard histopathology scoring methodology. Second, with the assistance of the software, the variability of the predicted classifications among different pathologists was greatly reduced. Of importance, with the assistance of LIRA, a more accurate pathology comparison will be possible across multiple animal studies, different longitudinally time points, and studies performed at multiple laboratories. Where LIRA outperforms the individual pathologist is the consistent and accurate demarcation of lesion margins, as well as the detection of small regions on a microscopic level, which both substantially affect the quantitative analysis of the lesion area involvement. Pathologists and LIRA in most instances both correctly classify the lesion type, but the variability in the results from classical pathologist readouts is derived from the imprecise or inconsistent demarcation of lesion margins. Where pathologist expertise and intervention is still needed and preferred, is for the identification of infrequent pathology events or unusual artifacts. As also described for other applications in medical image analysis, diagnostic confidence never reaches 100% and combining machine learning and physician or pathologist experience reliably enhances system performance63.",

LIRA is affected by features such as the presence of high red blood cell numbers and processing artifacts, which led to the software incorrectly classifying these regions as pulmonary lesions instead of healthy tissue. Deviation from the sample preparation protocol presented in our methods section, including using frozen sections or changes in section thickness, will also result in a decrease in accuracy. When sample preparation varies, it is recommended that a new model be trained on image patches generated with these new protocols. In addition, the current iteration of LIRA is designed to identify lesion types for C3HeB/FeJ pulmonary tissue collected between 6-10 weeks post infection. We have tested LIRA on more commonly used BALB/c or C57BL/6 pulmonary tissues infected with Mtb, and results showed these mouse samples are also suitable for LIRA use. For the more conventional mouse models we now also opted to generate a new, simpler system. The recently developed software is similar to LIRA, but is solely composed of a single neural network that can generate classifications for TB lesion, Healthy, Unknown, and Empty, because the more traditional mouse models generally only develop one lesion type after infection with TB. Because the model is simpler, the readout will be faster than LIRA and have greater accuracy since it was designed specifically for those models. We also intend to make this code available in our open source repository. Lastly, we used multiple different image capture devices for generating the training set, however, all with similar image resolution. Although not observed in our setting, it is possible that different image variables such the resolution of the camera, image file format, and variability in staining intensities could alter the final output for LIRA. The optimal settings for LIRA at this time are a camera resolution between 0.33 to 0.5 microns/pixel with images saved as a Portable Network Graphics (PNG), image acquisition using the 20x objective, and following the staining procedure for H&E as described here.",

While there are certain limitations with the current model, these can easily be corrected and adjusted. The ability to more quickly and more accurately assess the effect of treatment interventions on histopathology of target organs will improve the evaluation of the efficacy of novel antibiotics and vaccines. Our demonstrated approach is not limited to TB and can be modified to include additional diseases and animal models, by creating new training sets and modifying the original architecture of LIRA to meet the needs of the researcher.",

Pulmonary tissue samples were placed in a single cassette per mouse, then paraffin embedded and sectioned. Tissue sections (5 \u00b5m) with the largest surface area were used for further histopathology analysis and mounted on glass slides. Paraffin sections processed for Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining underwent a Xylene bath for 10 min before undergoing gradient hydration. Samples were stained using a Leica ST5020 instrument with an initial staining step using Hematoxylin 560 (Leica Selectech, Buffalo Grove, IL) for 5 min and rinsed in tap water. Next, the slides were washed using a Define wash step (Leica Selectech, Buffalo Grove, IL) for 10 sec before being placed in a Blue Buffer Solution (Leica Selectech, Buffalo Grove, IL) for 1 min. The slides were then rinsed with Eosin for 1 min before being transferred to 96 Eosin Y 515 (Leica Selectech, Buffalo Grove, IL) for 3 min. The final step included a washing step with 96% EtOH for 6 min before being mounted using a LEICA CV5030 Mounting instrument (Leica Selectech, Buffalo Grove, IL), thereby using the Coverseal-X Xylene Mounting Media (Cancer Diagnostic Inc., Durham, NC). Slides were generated and stained at three facilities using similar, however not the exact same, protocols over a time span of several years (2012-2018). Digital image scans from microscopic slides containing C3HeB/FeJ lungs were generated from one of three image capture devices. Image scans from Premier Laboratories (Longmont, CO) were generated on an Aperio Scanscope XT digital slide scanner (Nikon, Melville, NY) at 20x magnification. At the Experimental Pathology Core (CSU), the images were acquired using an Olympus VS120 digital slide scanner (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) using the Olympus VS-ASW software (v.2.9; Olympus, Center Valley, PA) at 20x magnification. Images acquired in the MIP Department were generated on a Nikon Eclipse Ti robotic inverted microscope with a DS-Qi1Mc digital camera (Nikon, Melville, NY) at 20x magnification, using the Nikon NIS Elements AR software (v. 4.51.00; Nikon, Melville, NY). In total, 86 slides were scanned on the Aperio Scanscope, 84 slides were scanned on the Olympus VS120 and 6 images were generated on the Nikon inverted microscope. All three imaging devices used for generating whole slide images show similar image resolutions, with 0.5 microns/pixel for the Aperio XT, and <0.33 micron/pixel for the Olympus VS120, and 0.322 micron/pixel for the Nikon camera at 20x magnification. Therefore, limited variability in digitizing the results was expected by the different image capture devices used. The variability between images was mainly caused by the nature of collecting biological data and differences in sample processing (processing by different technicians, using slight modifications of H&E staining protocols). This was merely seen as an asset for developing the software since it provided a realistic level of noise or variability to our data reflecting results expected in future. In total, for the training and subsequent validation of LIRA, lung sections from 176 mice were scanned digitally to generate 176 digital image scans (containing all five lung lobes for every mouse per microscopic slide and per digital image scan). To reduce the file size of the image scans, digital image files were generated for every individual lung lobe (resulting in five digital image files per mouse).",

Type I lesions show well organized, caseous, necrotic lesions with a layer of foamy macrophages around a core composed of neutrophilic debris, which is surrounded by a collagen rim with interstitial macrophages admixed within the rim. Type I lesions contain high bacterial numbers, which are either extracellularly located in the lesion core, or intracellular in foamy macrophages. The Type II lesions are less organized with a massive recruitment of neutrophils, resulting in large areas of alveolar wall necrosis throughout the lung parenchyma. Type II lesions also contain high bacterial numbers, both intra- and extracellularly. Type III lesions develop as a result of accumulation of lymphocytes, epithelioid, and foamy macrophages as well as small pockets of neutrophils. The latter is similar to the main lesion type described for other immunocompetent mouse strains such as the BALB/c and C57BL/671\u201373.",

The Type I Core is composed of central necrosis surrounded by a dense neutrophilic debris layer, and a foamy macrophage layer which lies within the collagen rim. The Type I Rim composition includes the collagen rim and the outside layer composed of fibroblasts, epithelioid, and activated macrophages, and clusters of lymphocytic cells. The \u2018Type II\u2019 pulmonary lesion consists primarily of large numbers of neutrophils at times visible as a honeycomb-like structure of lung parenchyma. Along the periphery of the Type II lesion, the presence of aggregates of extracellular DNA, pockets of lymphocytes, and compressed tissue can be present. These pathology features are mostly found in close proximity and therefore also classified as Type II. The \u2018Type III\u2019 pulmonary lesions are cellular inflammatory lesions composed primarily of epithelioid, foamy and activated macrophages, large numbers of lymphocytes, and small pockets of neutrophils.

The miscellaneous classification includes pleural pneumonia, adipose tissue, non-TB specific inflammation, as well as staining and processing artifacts.

This implementation of multiple neural networks working together follows the natural logic employed by trained researchers to classify lesions by intuitively first investigating on a more general, macroscopic level (for Type I lesion recognition), followed by a more detailed analysis on a microscopic level to identify other pathological features on a cellular level. In preliminary work, we used a single CNN to identify all seven classifications. However, due to similarities between multiple lesion types at a microscopic scale (such as the necrosis encountered in a Type I core and a Type II lesion), multiple neural networks operating at different visual scales (macro and micro) were used to limit misclassification of lesion types. No preprocessing of the images was employed in either training of the models or within the pipeline. The final approach, illustrated in Fig. 2, employs a modular architecture55\u201358 with three CNNs and two human intervention checkpoints. After a digital image is uploaded, in a first step the macro-classifier (CNN1) identifies the Type I physiological structure with its characteristic caseous necrotic center and collagen rim. Human feedback is required after this initial step to reduce the false positive rate of Type II lesions misclassified as Type I lesions (see also in result section 1). The macro-classifier CNN1 will then identify the individual image areas either positively or negatively for the Type I pathology features. Based upon the macro-classifier CNN1 prediction, the digital image areas are partitioned into two separate data sets, classified as \u2018Type I\u2019 or \u2018not Type I\u2019 lesion. Subsequently, both the positively or negatively identified image areas are further analyzed at a microscopic level based on cell types, by either the CNN2 or the CNN3 micro-classifiers. Both CNN2 and CNN3 require that the digital image sections are tiled into individual image patches that are 80 \u00d7 145 pixels in size. In case a Type I lesion is detected after CNN1, then CNN2 analyzes these image patches further and classifies each image patch as either Type I Rim, Type I Core, Healthy Tissue, Miscellaneous, or Empty. The remaining image patches (not identified by CNN1) are in parallel further classified with CNN3 as either Type II, Type III, Healthy, Miscellaneous, or Empty.",

RPIC are classified, classification locations stored, and subsequently visualized as colored overlays on the digital image. Every classification category is represented by a different color for easy visual, qualitative analysis and result verification (See Fig. 1). The classifications with unique colors for the seven pathology classifications are then overlaid and smoothed with a node labeling algorithm74, with each image patch classification being considered an individual node, onto the original H&E stained scanned digital image. The digital image of the lung lobe with colored overlay is then inspected and verified by the user at a second human intervention checkpoint, and at this point the user can make changes before the final classification calculations are performed (Fig. 2). Ultimately, the final output of LIRA using the two human intervention checkpoints includes the enumeration of the various lesion types, as well as the calculation of the area of lung involvement per classification category (presented as RIPC and % lung involvement per category). The LIRA software will provide a plain text, comma separated values (CSV) file, that consists of an automated enumeration of the number of RIPC for every classification category (7 in total). With the individual RIPC per classification category, the software then calculates the total lung area RIPC. Based on these calculations, the estimated % involvement is automatically calculated for each classification category by using the RIPC number for each lesion type divided by the total tissue RIPC x 100. Both the RIPC for each classification, as well as the % of lung area for each classification, is presented to the user in a CSV file for each image.

The purpose of these patches was solely to identify the Type I lesion structure at a macroscopic level. Additionally, 1.2 and 1.3 million image patches with a pixel size of 80 \u00d7 145 were collected in a similar manner for further classification at a microscopic level for both the Type 1 (CNN2) and Non-Type 1 lesion classification (CNN3), respectively. The image patches were generated as follows. In an initial step, the experienced technicians or pathologists performed manual labeling of the various classifications on an intact image. The specific regions of interests (ROI) for each classification type were subsequently extracted from the original image. The cropped ROIs were subsequently further divided into individual image patches. The reason for generating image patches for training from specific regions of interests (ROI) was primarily to prevent multiple conflicting labels being applied to a single lesion type. Due to the availability of data, not all lesion types were represented equally, which thereby created an unbalanced dataset. For training, we therefore did not use all generated image patches but these were random selected.",

In a first step, the pathologists hand labeled each 80 \u00d7 145 pixel image patch using one out of seven classifications (same as described for LIRA). Data on every 80 \u00d7 145 pixel sized image patch classification was collected as RIPC. The hand labeled result by the pathologists and technicians generated a 7-color classification overlay for every digital image. The result also included the calculated RIPC for each of the seven classification categories for every digital image of a single lung lobe. In a second step, seven days later, the pathologists and research technicians were presented with the same seven digital images of lung lobes to review, this time with the assistance of LIRA predictions for both the macroscopic (CNN1) and microscopic classifications (CNN2, CNN3). Both the pathologists and technicians were requested to review the LIRA predictions, and to intervene and potentially modify the Type I lesion detection at the first intervention step (CNN1 LIRA prediction) and/or the individual image patch classifications at the second intervention step (CNN2, CNN3 LIRA prediction), if needed.",

To study the variance in readouts between the different pathologists after manually reviewing the digital images, we opted for an inter annotator comparison approach to calculate the agreement among the pathologists with and without LIRA. The Krippendorff\u2019s alpha coefficient calculation using nominal data and any number of observers was implemented here as an analysis tool to quantify the agreement between the prediction results of multiple observers with or without assistance with LIRA. The Krippendorff\u2019s alpha approach takes into account chance classifications, can be used with nominal data, using more than two raters, with multiple categories, plus the approach can be used with large datasets79. Each image patch was considered as a separate observation, and the classifications from all four pathologists were used for calculations. The Krippendorff\u2019s alpha approach provides a coefficient between 0 and 1, with \u03b1 < 0.667 being rejected, \u03b1 \u2265 0.667 being the lowest acceptable limit, and \u03b1 \u2265 0.800 being considered to have good agreement80.",
