One aspect of care that has potential to affect all of the above is postoperative mechanical ventilation. Historically, postoperative ventilation was considered a must for maintaining patient stability. Ironically, it is recognized that mechanical ventilation may increase risk of adverse outcomes in the postoperative period. Hence, many institutions have advocated for immediate extubation or early extubation after many congenital heart surgeries which was first reported decades ago. Methods: 637 consecutive patient charts were reviewed for pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were placed into three groups. Those that were extubated in the operating room (OR) at the conclusion of surgery (Immediate Extubation or IE), those that were extubated within six hours of admission to the ICU (Early Extubation or EE) and those that were extubated sometime after six hours (Delayed Extubation or DE). Multiple variables were then recorded to see which factors correlated with successful Immediate or Early Extubation. Results: Overall, 338 patients (53.1%) had IE), 273 (42.8%) had DE while only 26 patients (4.1%) had EE. The median age was 1174 days for the IE patients, 39 days for the DE patients, whereas 194 days for EE patients (p < 0.001). Weight and length were also significantly different in at least one extubation group from the other two (p < 0.001). The median ICU LOS was 3 and 4 days for IE and EE patients respectively, whereas it was 9.5 days for DE patients (p < 0.001). DE group had a significant longer median anesthesia time and cardiopulmonary bypass time than the other two extubation groups (p > 63,826.88 < 0.001). Regional low flow perfusion, deep hypothermia, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, redo sternotomy, use of other sedatives, furosemide, epinephrine, vasopressin, open chest, cardiopulmonary support, pulmonary edema, syndrome, as well as difficult intubation were significantly associated with delayed extubation (IE, EE or DE). Conclusions: Immediate and early extubation was significantly associated with several factors, including patient age and size, duration of CPB, use of certain anesthetic drugs, and the amount of blood loss and blood replacement. IE can be successfully accomplished in a majority of pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, including in a minority of infants.",

Extubation group (IE + EE vs. DE) was used as the main predictor, while age, weight, and length were adjusted as covariates. Patients with IE and EE were included as one group due to small sample size in the EE group. Blood products were measured at two times. Thus, generalized linear models with repeated measures was used to assess the effect of extubation group on the dose of each blood product overtime adjusting for age, weight, and length as covariates. For the administered medications/blood products and procedures, not every patient received these items. Thus, when we compare the doses of each medication/blood product, or duration of the procedure by the extubation groups, patients that did not receive the product/procedure were excluded from the lognormal regression and generalized linear models. For example, only 536 out of the 637 patients had their aorta cross clamped (XC) as part of the procedure; we conducted the regression analysis using the duration of XC from the 536 patients as the outcome.",

Many neonates, including those undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 h after surgery. Early extubation (EE) has been associated with low morbidity rates and shorter lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays [10] . In additional studies, immediate extubation was associated with a shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), lower postoperative ICU costs, and minimal increase in operating room turnover time, but without an increase in reintubation rates [6] . Even though costs were not analyzed in this review, our data also demonstrated reduced LOS in the CICU and LOS in the hospital without an increase in reintubation rates. Low gestational age, preoperative ventilatory support requirement, and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time were inversely associated with the ability to accomplish IE [11, 12] . In a five-year cohort study of infants post repair for transposition of great arteries, greater CPB and cross-clamp times and minimum temperatures less than or equal to 30.4 degrees centigrade were associated with a lesser likelihood of IE [13] . Another five-year study demonstrated an inverse relationship between age and CPB time and early extubation [14] .",

There was also a strong inverse relationship between younger age, smaller size, longer CPB time, longer aortic cross clamp time, use of deep hypothermia, longer RLP time, DHCA, need for epinephrine or vasopressin, ICU blood loss and the ability to achieve IE or EE. These variables are also markers for more complex repairs, which is more likely to lead to inadequate hemostasis or hemodynamic instability. Higher doses of fentanyl and midazolam were also inversely correlated with IE/EE. The two main criteria our institution utilizes for IE is hemodynamic stability, without the need for escalating doses of inotropic support and minimal blood loss (less than 10 cc/kg/hr). Many pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease fit this criterion, especially patients over age one. Our standard protocol is to wean from CPB with milrinone; epinephrine is used if this is inadequate. Our data indicates that the need and dose of epinephrine is greater in the DE group. With respect to blood loss, there is a significantly greater amount in the DE group. With respect to transfusion requirements, the only difference between the groups was the amount of PRBC. The differences in the amount of other component blood products was not significant, which was surprising to the authors. It is noteworthy, that inadequate hemostasis is one of the main reasons patients at our institution do not get extubated in the OR.",

However, even one third of this cohort were in the IE/EE groups, including patients undergoing complex repairs. If hemodynamic stability and adequate hemostasis can be achieved in this cohort, they can be candidates for IE. The median age of the patients in this infant DE group was 20 days, significantly different than the roughly six months ages of the IE/EE cohort. However, even neonates experienced IE or EE in our data set, but we did not do a sub-analysis of neonates alone since this cohort was too small. Other investigators have also demonstrated this association between age and the ability to IE or EE. In a retrospective review of over 900 pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, there was an inverse relationship between patient age and the ability to achieve EE, i.e., the younger the patient the less likely they were to experience EE [15] . Other investigators have reported similar results [16] . One noteworthy meta-analysis demonstrated that various investigators define early extubation differently [17] . Early extubation ranged from in the operating room to as much as 24 h after surgery. The anesthetic protocols also varied greatly between the studies, with varying inhalational agents, drugs and doses. Modern, short-acting anesthetics, like remifentanil, dexmedetomidine and propofol and various regional techniques, like intrathecal or caudal morphine have made early and immediate extubation possible, even for longer surgeries involving complex repairs [18] . Sugammadex has been another noteworthy addition to the anesthetic armamentarium, but more studies need to be conducted in this patient population.",

Etomidate or fentanyl is substituted for propofol if the physiology dictates that myocardial depression or vasodilatation should be avoided. Maintenance is with dexmedetomidine (0.5-1 mcg/kg/hr), propofol (50-100 mcg/kg/min), rocuronium and sevoflurane or some combination, coupled with the ONQ Pain Buster and more recently liposomal bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia (4 mg/kg liposomal bupivacaine admixed with 3 mL 0.25% bupivacaine for every mL of liposomal bupivacaine, plus 0.9% NS to produce a volume of 10 mL per linear inch of incision plus 10 mL for every chest tube site). Sugammadex is now routinely used for reversal of the neuromuscular block from rocuronium. Fentanyl doses are routinely kept below 5 mcg/kg in those patients where IE/EE is to be attempted; higher doses of fentanyl greatly reduce the possibility of IE/EE. Adequacy of reversal of neuromuscular blockage is assessed with a peripheral nerve stimulator at the conclusion of the case. Patients are allowed to breath spontaneously and extubation occurs when the breathing pattern is regular and tidal volumes exceed 5 mL/kg. The airway is assessed for obstruction before leaving the OR. If airway obstruction exists it is treated with airway positioning or a nasal airway. A ROTEM based transfusion protocol is utilized for hemostasis; the largest reason for delayed extubation is inadequate hemostasis.",
