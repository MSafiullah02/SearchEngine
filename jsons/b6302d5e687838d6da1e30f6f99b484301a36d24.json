Beyond the actions or pronouncements of a single individual or department chief, strong leadership should be visible and coherently expressed at all levels of an emergency department; this includes catalyzing and encouraging good decision making by front-line staff in the hundreds of interactions that occur in any given shift.

On-shift in-situ simulations allow entire teams to build confidence in their ability to perform anticipated high-risk procedures and can be used for excellent team-building exercises. In terms of psychological well-being, physicians with either expertise in or a predilection for wellness and wellness activities need to be engaged and put to work. Support is needed for those who are unable to work due to self-isolation or illness and for those who are working but are experiencing the duress of school closures and other challenges imposed by states of emergency. Providing meals, babysitting, moral support, and connection are low-hanging fruit in this regard. When organizing regular staff meetings (using virtual means as needed), offering ample time for staff to express their ideas, discuss difficult cases, and vent can help improve communication, maintain morale, and ensure staff are being heard.",

Let your team know about all the good work that's being done to protect the ED and control the pandemic. In many jurisdictions the establishment of off-site COVID-19 assessment and testing centres as well as greatly ramped up nurse-managed health information telephone lines have helped minimize what would certainly would have been a flood of low-acuity suspected COVID-19 infected patients in the ED.",

Online platforms can readily replace academic half days or ED grand rounds, or they can be used to host special COVID-19-oriented town halls. Panelists and presenters can cover key topics, such as airway management and the donning/doffing of personal protective equipment, through live and archived videos.

Collaborate and share experiences and feelings with trusted peers. To stay positive and engaged we need a deep sense of purpose and to find meaning in our roles and pride in our response. 2 Dr. Viktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist and Holocaust survivor, wrote in his memoir, \"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms-to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\" 3 How we carry ourselves as leaders during this crisis is one thing within our control.",
