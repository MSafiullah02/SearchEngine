The DNA probe tests that are available at the University of Georgia Infectious Disease Laboratory can distinguish between PBFD and Psittacine Circovirus 2 (PsCV-2) of lories [15]. The PBFD DNA probe tests are performed on whole blood and detect viral DNA; a positive means that there was PBFD viral DNA in the blood. In a bird that has no clinical signs, it is recommended to retest the bird in 90 days to determine if the viral DNA is still present. If it is still present then the bird is infected, but if not, then the bird may have been infected transiently and overcame the infection. Any bird that displays feather abnormalities should have a feather follicle biopsy and DNA in situ hybridization performed in addition to the DNA probe blood test because some clinical birds are so viremic that they will have a negative blood test. This also can occur if a bird is extremely leukopenic [4]. A DNA probe test can be used to detect viral DNA on a swab of the environment to assist in determining the effectiveness of disinfection efforts. Treatment consists of supportive care and antimicrobials for secondary infections.",
