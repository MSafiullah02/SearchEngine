As of March 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been notified of 2143 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV globally, including 750 deaths. 3 Apart from epidemiologic clustering and virus-specific diagnostic testing, there is little clinically that distinguishes MERS-CoV infection from other severe viral respiratory infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or influenza. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the preferred method for detecting MERS-CoV. Suitable specimens for testing include lower respiratory tract samples (LRT), nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, and nasal aspirates. The LRT samples have been shown to contain the highest viral loads, possibly due to virus tropism for LRT cells. 4,5 Confirmation using realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays require a positive result for at least two different specific targets on the MERS-CoV genome using a validated assay, or a positive rRT-PCR result for one specific target on the MERS-CoV genome plus MERS-CoV sequence confirmation from a separate viral genomic target. 6 Nucleic acid sequencing of an amplicon has also been recommended when there are discordant results on different assays, 6,7 confirming the specificity of the target. It is important that laboratories develop technical capability to accurately and promptly identify MERS-CoV to implement appropriate infection control and isolation procedures to reduce the potential for transmission, and aid a rapid epidemiological investigation. External quality assessment programs are an essential tool for monitoring the diagnostic proficiency of laboratories and providing results that allow implementation of improved testing, thereby strengthening global capability in reducing spread. The WHO initiated a single round Proficiency Testing Program (PTP) for the detection of MERS-CoV by PCR, which was conducted in the first half of 2015 by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "rule out or confirm the presence of MERS-CoV; 2. rule out or confirm the presence of a HCoV other than MERS-CoV; 3. identify the HCoV, if present.

This was performed qualitatively, with correct responses assigned on the basis of reporting the expected result eg MERS-CoV ruled out, other HCoV confirmed present and identified as human coronavirus 229E. Performance was assessed separately for the detection of MERS-CoV and the detection and identification of other HCoVs. Results submitted for synthetic specimens J and K were not scored, as participants were likely to obtain varying results depending on the gene region and PCR marker used by the testing laboratory. In particular, participants performing MERS-CoV-specific testing according to the assay developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) would expect a negative result for specimen J, as this assay targets a region of the N gene that is different to the region that was used to design the in vitro RNA transcript included in specimen J. 10 These specimens were included as they could provide interesting information in regard to how participating laboratories handle equivocal test results. 3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Capability to detect MERS-CoV and other HCoVs by PCR Overall, 76 of 96 (79.2%) laboratories correctly reported the presence or absence of MERS-CoV in all nine scored specimens (Figure 1).

A range of manual RNA extraction systems from Qiagen, Macherey-Nagel, and Roche were used by seven, five, and four participants, respectively. 4 | DISCUSSION The PTP provides insight into the diagnostic methodology and performance of laboratories in detecting MERS-CoV worldwide. The high level of concordance between the 96 participating laboratories suggests a high global capacity to detect MERS-CoV. Despite this, a small number of laboratories performed poorly and the results of this PTP identify opportunities for future improvement. Incorrect results could be attributed to three main causes: (i) cross contamination, (ii) low sensitivity of the NAT (predominantly PCR), or (iii) transcription error. A number of laboratories reported a MERS-CoV false positive result for the human coronavirus samples (specimens B and C) and the negative sample (specimen I). These results were all reported with high C t values, suggesting cross contamination of samples. There were four participants reporting false negative results for specimen G, which contained the lowest concentration of MERS-CoV. These participants consistently reported unusually high C t values for specimens across the panel, indicating that these laboratories had relatively low sensitivity in their PCR assay and may not have been able to detect MERS-CoV at lower concentrations. This finding is similar to that of two previous external quality assessments, which reported some laboratories to have reduced assay sensitivity when assessed on a", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "The design of these transcripts was based on the complete genome sequence of human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (GenBank accession number: JX869059.2). The following five regions of the MERS-CoV genome were included in the two synthetic specimens: a 385-nucleotide region upstream of the E protein gene (upE) covering nucleotides 27 312 to 27 696; 500 nucleotides of the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) starting at nucleotide 10 923; a 502-nucleotide region of the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) starting at nucleotide 18 054, as well as two regions; one from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) starting at nucleotide 14 994 and another from the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene starting at nucleotide 29 523, with a length of 392 and 491 nucleotides, respectively. The five RNA transcripts were designed to yield positive results in RT-PCR assays that were originally published by Corman et al, 6,7 which formed the basis of the \"WHO interim guidance-laboratory testing for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\" 8 Specimen J contained all five RNA transcripts, whilst specimen K contained a single transcript covering upE. This was designed to challenge participants with a sample (K) that would yield an equivocal result, as confirmatory testing to initial screening would return negative.All specimens provided were lyophilized and tested for homogeneity and stability.

The absence of MERS-CoV in the negative control sample (specimen I) was correctly reported by 88 of 96 (91.7%) participants(Table 3). Five participants reported false-positive results, and three laboratories did not report a result for this specimen (I) for unknown reasons.A large proportion of participants reported that they have no or limited capability to test for human coronaviruses other than MERS-CoV. To account for this variability, performance was assessed separately for the detection of MERS-CoV and the detection and identification of other HCoVs. There were 69 of 96 (71.9%) laboratories that returned results regarding other HCoVs, with 27 (28.1%) correctly confirming or ruling out the presence of other HCoVs in all nine specimens (Table 2) and 29 (30.2%) correctly identifying the two other HCoVs included in specimen B (HCoV-OC43), specimen C (HCoV-229E), and specimen H (MERS-CoV & HCoV-229E).

Participants would only get a positive result in an initial screening assay against upE, while confirmatory tests of this initial screen would be negative. The protocol recommended by the WHO advises further specimens to be collected in the absence of a confirmatory result. The US CDC protocol recommends reporting of an equivocal result and contacting the CDC for consultation. In the context of this PTP, the expected result for specimen K would have been \"not specified\" and a comment as for equivocal results and/or the necessity to collect and test a second sample. Interestingly, more than half of the participating laboratories reported the presence of MERS-CoV in specimen K despite the fact that confirmatory NAT assays against targets other than upE were negative. Additionally, a small number of laboratories were found to be only performing an average of one PCR assay per sample. These results highlight the need for laboratories to follow a NAT regimen with at least two independent assays. Laboratories need to have detailed guidelines for MERS-CoV PCR test interpretation as well as reporting instructions. By addressing these issues, it is anticipated that the global laboratory capacity for MERS-CoV detection will be enhanced.Engaging international laboratories, especially those in countries with limited exposure to routine QA proved to be one of the major challenges in organizing and executing this PTP. Language barriers, limited resources, skepticism toward an unknown organization, as well as the need for laboratories to continue their routine testing alongside PTP sample testing most likely contributed to difficulties with engagement.

Laboratories need access to QA programs, and continued encouragement for engaging in these QA activities, which are in addition to, but important for their diagnostic functions.
