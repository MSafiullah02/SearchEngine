            "text": "The 2002-3 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was one of the most significant public health events in recent history 1 . An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses [3] [4] [5] , attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa [5] [6] [7] [8] , but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) 9, 10 . Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.",

The species origin of all positive samples was confirmed to be R. sinicus by cytochrome b sequence analysis, as described previously 16 . A higher prevalence was observed in samples collected in October (30% in 2011 and 48.7% in 2012) than those in April (7.1% in 2011) or May (7.4% in 2012) (Extended Data Table 1 ). Analysis of the S protein RBD sequences indicated the presence of seven different strains of SL-CoVs ( Fig. 1a and Extended Data Figs 1 and 2). In addition to RBD sequences, which closely matched previously described SL-CoVs (Rs672, Rf1 and HKU3) 5, 8, 17, 18 , two novel strains (designated SL-CoV RsSHC014 and Rs3367) were discovered. Their full-length genome sequences were determined, and both were found to be 29,787 base pairs in size (excluding the poly(A) tail). The overall nucleotide sequence identity of these two genomes with human SARS-CoV (Tor2 strain) is 95%, higher than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China (88-92%) 5, 8, 17, 18 or Europe (76%) 6 (Extended Data Table 2 and Extended Data Figs 3 and 4). Higher sequence identities were observed at the protein level between these new SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs (Extended Data Tables 3 and 4 ). To understand the evolutionary origin of these two novel SL-CoV strains, we conducted recombination analysis with the Recombination Detection Program 4.0 package 19 using available genome sequences of bat SL-CoV strains (Rf1, Rp3, Rs672, Rm1, HKU3 and BM48-31) and human and civet representative SARS-CoV strains (BJ01, SZ3, Tor2 and GZ02). Three breakpoints were detected with strong P values (,10 220 ) and supported by similarity plot and bootscan analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b) . Breakpoints were located at nucleotides 20,827, 26,553 and 28,685 in the Rs3367 (and RsSHC014) genome, and generated recombination fragments covering nucleotides 20,827-26,533 (5,727 nucleotides) (including partial open reading frame (ORF) 1b, full-length S, ORF3, E and partial M gene) and nucleotides 26,534-28,685 (2,133 nucleotides) (including partial ORF M, full-length ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and partial N gene). Phylogenetic analysis using the major and minor parental regions suggested that Rs3367, or RsSHC014, is the descendent of a recombination of lineages that ultimately lead to SARS-CoV and SL-CoV Rs672 (Fig. 1b) .",

Our previous work provided phylogenetic evidence of this 5 , but the lack of an isolate or evidence that bat SL-CoVs can naturally infect human cells, until now, had cast doubt on this hypothesis. Second, the lack of capacity of SL-CoVs to use of ACE2 receptors has previously been considered as the key barrier for their direct spillover into humans, supporting the suggestion that civets were intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV adaptation to human transmission during the SARS outbreak 24 . However, the ability of SL-CoV-WIV1 to use human ACE2 argues against the necessity of this step for SL-CoV-WIV1 and suggests that direct batto-human infection is a plausible scenario for some bat SL-CoVs. This has implications for public health control measures in the face of potential spillover of a diverse and growing pool of recently discovered SARSlike CoVs with a wide geographic distribution.",

The high genetic diversity of SL-CoVs within this colony was mirrored by high phenotypic diversity in the differential use of ACE2 by different strains. It would therefore not be surprising if further surveillance reveals a broad diversity of bat SL-CoVs that are able to use ACE2, some of which may have even closer homology to SARS-CoV than SL-CoV-WIV1. Our results-in addition to the recent demonstration of MERS-CoV in a Saudi Arabian bat 25 , and of bat CoVs closely related to MERS-CoV in China, Africa, Europe and North America 3,26,27 -suggest that bat coronaviruses remain a substantial global threat to public health.",

Construction of expression clones for human and civet ACE2 in pcDNA3.1 has been described previously 29 . Bat ACE2 was amplified from a R. sinicus (sample no. 3357). In brief, total RNA was extracted from bat rectal tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand complementary DNA was synthesized from total RNA by reverse transcription with random hexamers. Full-length bat ACE2 fragments were amplified using forward primer bAF2 and reverse primer bAR2 (ref. 29) . The ACE2 gene was cloned into pCDNA3.1 with KpnI and XhoI, and verified by sequencing. Purified ACE2 plasmids were transfected to HeLa cells. After 24 h, lysates of HeLa cells expressing human, civet, or bat ACE2 were confirmed by western blot or immunofluorescence assay. Western blot analysis. Lysates of cells or filtered supernatants containing pseudoviruses were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). For detection of S protein, the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-Rp3 S fragment (amino acids 561-666) polyantibodies (1:200), and the bound antibodies were detected by alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000). For detection of HIV-1 p24 in supernatants, monoclonal antibody against HIV p24 (p24 MAb) was used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000, followed by incubation with AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at the same dilution. To detect the expression of ACE2 in HeLa cells, goat antibody against the human ACE2 ectodomain (1:500) was used as the first antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1,000). Virus isolation. Vero E6 cell monolayers were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. PCR-positive samples (in 200 ml buffer) were gradient centrifuged at 3,000-12,000g, and supernatant were diluted 1:10 in DMEM before being added to Vero E6 cells. After incubation at 37 uC for 1 h, inocula were removed and replaced with fresh DMEM with 2% FCS. Cells were incubated at 37 uC for 3 days and checked daily for cytopathic effect. Double-dose triple antibiotics penicillin/ streptomycin/amphotericin (Gibco) were included in all tissue culture media (penicillin 200 IU ml 21 , streptomycin 0.2 mg ml 21 , amphotericin 0.5 mg ml 21 ). Three blind passages were carried out for each sample. After each passage, both the culture supernatant and cell pellet were examined for presence of virus by RT-PCR using primers targeting the RdRP or S gene. Virions in supernatant (10 ml) were collected and fixed using 0.1% formaldehyde for 4 h, then concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (5 ml) at 80,000g for 90 min using a Ty90 rotor (Beckman). The pelleted viral particles were suspended in 100 ml PBS, stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) and examined using a Tecnai transmission electron microscope (FEI) at 200 kV. Virus infectivity detected by immunofluorescence assay. Cell lines used for this study and their culture conditions are summarized in Extended Data Table 5 . Virus titre was determined in Vero E6 cells by cytopathic effect (CPE) counts. Cell lines from different origins and HeLa cells expressing ACE2 from human, civet or Chinese horseshoe bat were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates (Corning) incubated with bat SL-CoV-WIV1 at a multiplicity of infection 5 10 for 1 h. The inoculum was removed and washed twice with PBS and supplemented with medium. HeLa cells without ACE2 expression and Vero E6 cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. At 24 h after infection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 4 uC. ACE2 expression was detected using goat anti-human ACE2 immunoglobulin (R&D Systems) followed by FITC-labelled donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin (PTGLab). Virus replication was detected using rabbit antibody against the SL-CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein followed by Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Staining patterns were examined using a FV1200 confocal microscope (Olympus). Virus infectivity detected by real-time RT-PCR. Vero E6, A549, PK15, RSKT and HeLa cells with or without expression of ACE2 of different origins were inoculated with 0.1 TCID 50 WIV-1 and incubated for 1 h at 37 uC. After removing the inoculum, the cells were cultured with medium containing 1% FBS. Supernatants were collected at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h. RNA from 140 ml of each supernatant was extracted with the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 60 ml buffer AVE (Qiagen). RNA was quantified on the ABI StepOne system, with the TaqMan AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a 25 ml reaction mix containing 4 ml RNA, 1 3 RT-PCR enzyme mix, 1 3 RT-PCR buffer, 40 pmol forward primer (59-GTGGTGGTGACGGCA AAATG-39), 40 pmol reverse primer (59-AAGTGAAGCTTCTGGGCCAG-39) and 12 pmol probe (59-FAM-AAAGAGCTCAGCCCCAGATG-BHQ1-39). Amplification parameters were 10 min at 50 uC, 10 min at 95 uC and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 uC and 20 s at 60 uC. RNA dilutions from purified WIV-1 stock were used as a standard. Serum neutralization test. SARS patient sera were inactivated at 56 uC for 30 min and then used for virus neutralization testing. Sera were diluted starting with 1:10 LETTER RESEARCH and then serially twofold diluted in 96-well cell plates to 1:40. Each 100 ml serum dilution was mixed with 100 ml viral supernatant containing 100 TCID5 0 of WIV1 and incubated at 37 uC for 1 h. The mixture was added in triplicate wells of 96-well cell plates with plated monolayers of Vero E6 cells and further incubated at 37 uC for 2 days. Serum from a healthy blood donor was used as a negative control in each experiment. CPE was observed using an inverted microscope 2 days after inoculation. The neutralizing antibody titre was read as the highest dilution of serum which completely suppressed CPE in infected wells. The neutralization test was repeated twice. Recombination analysis. Full-length genomic sequences of SL-CoV Rs3367 or RsSHC014 were aligned with those of selected SARS-CoVs and bat SL-CoVs using Clustal X. The aligned sequences were preliminarily scanned for recombination events using Recombination Detection Program (RDP) 4.0 (ref. 19 ). The potential recombination events suggested by RDP owing to their strong P values (, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] were investigated further by similarity plot and bootscan analyses implemented in Simplot 3.5.1. Phylogenetic origin of the major and minor parental regions of Rs3367 or RsSHC014 were constructed from the concatenated sequences of the essential ORFs of the major and minor parental regions of selected SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs. Two genome regions between three estimated breakpoints (20,827-26,553 and 26,554-28,685) were aligned independently using ClustalX and generated two alignments of 5,727 base pairs and 2,133 base pairs. The two alignments were used to construct maximum likelihood trees to better infer the fragment parents. All nucleotide numberings in this study are based on Rs3367 genome position. ",
