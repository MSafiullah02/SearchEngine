To improve the compliance in a study such as this, a number of methods could be employed. Firstly, it is important that a single researcher establishes a good relationship with the parent and the family. This helps the family to feel that they have a support person they can contact during the study. Web-based diaries that could be filled out by parents, or depending on the budget of the project personal electronic diaries, have been shown to improve diary card completion [15], [16]. While reply-paid envelopes that could be posted in standard Australia Post letterboxes were considered the most efficient and cost-effective way of posting swabs, perhaps if parents froze the nasal swabs and then a courier service collected them it may help to improve compliance. However, courier services, particularly with frozen samples, are expensive.",

Prevalence of parainfluenzae was less in the present study at 1% compared to up to 17% in other studies [2], [3], [19], [20].

The prevalence of adenovirus was similar to another study in adults, although less than others in children [2], [3], [20]. Differences in the prevalence of virus between studies can be explained by a number of factors: age of children (e.g. RSV is more common in infants), time of year when samples were taken (e.g. more influenza in winter), if samples were taken at time of an exacerbation or when the participants were well or symptom free, and if nasal/throat swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirate was used.",
