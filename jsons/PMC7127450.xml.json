The study was performed as a cross-sectional study, in which 353 patients with metabolic syndrome were analyzed. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to the proposed Asia-Pacific criteria of the WHO 1999 Consultation on definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications.19, 20 We classified subjects with the metabolic syndrome by WHO criteria according to the following schema: impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus and two or more of the following: (1) blood pressure \u2265 140/90 mm Hg or treated hypertension; (2) central obesity, waist-hip-ratio > 0.9 for men and > 0.85 for women; or BMI > 25 kg/m2; (3) microalbuminuria \u2265 30 mg/24 h on at least two different occasions, or more advanced nephropathy; (4) plasma triglycerides \u2265 150 mg/dL (\u22651.70 mmol/L) or HDL cholesterol < 35 mg/dL (<0.9 mmol/L) for men and < 39 mg/dL (<1.0 mmol/L) for women. Sitting blood pressure was measured twice to the nearest 2 mm Hg after a 5-minute rest using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (phases I and V of Korotkoff). The mean value from three separate measurements was calculated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure levels \u2265 140/90 mm Hg or the use of antihypertensive medication.21 BMI was calculated by weight divided by height squared. Each subject received a detailed interview about personal disease history and smoking history. All study subjects were of Han Chinese origin, without any known ancestors of another ethnic origin, and were living in the same region at the time of the study. All patients underwent complete physical examinations and routine biochemical analyses of blood and urine as well as an assessment of the presence and extent of macrovascular or microvascular diabetic complications. The anthropometric parameters required to calculate BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were measured. Plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and glucose were determined by standard methods on a Beckman LX20 analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, Calif).",

The reaction was terminated at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The PCR products were digested for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C with Alu I enzyme, electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide.

            "text": "Several lines of evidence indicate that an impaired ACE2 function is related to hypertension probably because of the impaired generation of angiotensin-(1\u20137), which has vasodilatory and natriuretic effects.9 Studies in animal models showed that the rat ACE2 maps to a quantitative trait locus with a significant logarithm-of-the-odds score for hypertension in three models of hypertension\u2014the Sabra salt-sensitive rat, the spontaneously hypertensive rat, and the stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rat.2 In these hypertensive rats, both ACE2 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced. It has been proposed that the elevated blood pressure in these three strains of rats may result from the increase in angiotensin II and reduced angiotensin-(1\u20137) as a result of decreased ACE2 activity.24 However, it should be noted that mice with targeted deletion of the ACE2 gene develop heart failure and finally hypotension.2 One might suggest that the A/G polymorphism of the ACE2 gene may determine differences in structure or activity of the ACE2, thereby promoting hypertension. In addition, reduced ACE2 is associated with upregulation of hypoxia-inducible genes and compensatory responses including the apelin system.8 Polymorphisms of the ACE2 gene were associated with familial predisposition to intracranial aneurysms in a Japanese cohort, probably indicating its effect on vascular modeling.25 The current study showing that female patients with metabolic syndrome who carry the GG genotype have significantly higher diastolic blood pressure is observational. The functional significance of the polymorphism, eg, abnormal levels of downstream metabolites of the renin-angiotensin system, is yet unknown in these patients. The allele frequencies for the G allele reported in the current study in Chinese patients with metabolic syndrome of Han Chinese origin were slightly higher compared with the allele frequency reported in Australian subjects of white Anglo-Celtic origin.22 In that study, the allele frequency of the G allele was about 18% in women and about 20% in men. However, patients with metabolic syndrome were not investigated in that study. As classifications of the metabolic syndrome may vary among different societies, further research is necessary to confirm that the current findings on ACE2 polymorphism also apply to non-Chinese populations.",
