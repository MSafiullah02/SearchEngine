            "text": "Recent years have witnessed the emergence of novel models for ad-hoc entity search in knowledge graphs of varying complexity. Since these models are based on direct term matching, their accuracy can suffer from a mismatch between vocabularies used in queries and entity descriptions. Although successful applications of word embeddings and knowledge graph entity embeddings to address the issues of vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc document retrieval and knowledge graph noisiness and incompleteness, respectively, have been reported in recent literature, the utility of joint word and entity embeddings for entity search in knowledge graphs has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Knowledge graph Entity and Word Embedding for Retrieval (KEWER), a novel method to embed entities and words into the same low-dimensional vector space, which takes into account a knowledge graph's local structure and structural components, such as entities, attributes, and categories, and is designed specifically for entity search. KEWER is based on random walks over the knowledge graph and can be considered as a hybrid of word and network embedding methods. Similar to word embedding methods, KEWER utilizes contextual co-occurrences as training data, however, it treats words and entities as different objects. Similar to network embedding methods, KEWER takes into account knowledge graph's local structure, however, it also differentiates between structural components. Experiments on publicly available entity search benchmarks and state-ofthe-art word and joint word and entity embedding methods indicate that a combination of KEWER and BM25F results in a consistent improvement in retrieval accuracy over BM25F alone.",

            "text": "In prior research, the problem of entity retrieval from a knowledge graph was cast into a special case of structured document retrieval [21, 22, 25, 45] , database search [18, 32] or a combination of the two [5, 35] . Such methods take into account only the directly adjacent structural components of a knowledge graph (entities, predicates, categories, and literals) when constructing a document for an entity from a knowledge graph. As a result, a significant amount of potentially useful information can be lost by not taking into account the local structure of knowledge graphs or structural components that are separated by more than one edge in a knowledge graph. For example, the entities Michelangelo and Sistine Chapel are separated by 3 edges in DBpedia. Another drawback of existing methods is that they only consider entities as points (i.e. entity documents) in a highdimensional space, with the number of dimensions equal to vocabulary size. This can lead to a well-known problem of vocabulary \"gap\" between queries and documents for relevant entities. For example, searchers looking for the entities that are related to the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne can pose the queries containing the terms \"Beaubourg\" or \"MNAM\", some or all of which may not be in the documents corresponding to the relevant entities. In ad-hoc document retrieval, vocabulary mismatch has been successfully addressed by employing the methods that create a low-dimensional representation of words and documents, such as Latent Semantic Indexing [8] , Latent Dirichlet Allocation [38] , word2vec [19] , and GloVe [26] . Many recently proposed approaches [10, 15, 36, 40, 41] have successfully utilized word embeddings to address vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc document IR.",

While the initial and some of the recent works in this area directly utilize word embeddings obtained using the methods such as word2vec, several word embedding models specifically targeting IR [9, 30, 42] have been recently proposed. The Dual Embedding Space Model [20] utilizes embedding matrices, which correspond to the two layers of the CBOW or Skip-gram architectures, to re-rank retrieval results. Experiments with this model indicate that utilizing IN-OUT instead of IN-IN similarity between embeddings of a query and document words allows for better modeling of aboutness of a document with respect to a query.",

Several studies [37, 39, 46] proposed a hybrid between entity and word embeddings by employing a loss function, which includes both a TransE-based component to model relations between entities and a word2vec-based component to model semantic relations between the words along with the third component, whose purpose is to align entity and word embeddings obtained by the first two components. In [23] authors take a different approach by learning word and entity embeddings without utilizing relations between entities from a knowledge graph and instead relying only on an unannotated corpus of text. None of the previously proposed approaches for learning joint word and entity embedding spaces were proposed specifically for entity search in a knowledge graph, and thus ignore important information, such as knowledge graph structural components.",

Both text and alignment components use textual descriptions of entities obtained from the short abstracts of entities using the rdfs:comment property. The text component in our implementation is formulated as a CBOW model with a single embedding space for words. The alignment component predicts the entity embedding given the sum of embeddings of words in entity description. As an alternative to using entity descriptions, we also implemented Jointly (sf) model, where alignment and text models are trained using all available surface forms for entities from S. As in the Sect. 3.3, we define three entity linking extensions of Jointly (Jointly el\u2212Sp , Jointly el\u2212SM , and Jointly el\u2212N ) using three different entity linking tools. We annotated all 467 queries using public DBpedia Spotlight API with confidence = 0.5, SMAPH, and Nordlys LTR and report the results for all entity linking models in Table 2 . We don't weight linked entities by their scores in Jointly, since we have found that entity weighting is not beneficial to this model. Results indicate that using the SMAPH entity linker results in the best performance for both KEWER and Jointly. For Jointly, using entity descriptions results in better performance than using surface forms. Table 2 shows that, even without entity linking, KEWER outperforms both Jointly and Jointly with entity linking based on all metrics. A significant increase in performance of Jointly after performing entity linking suggests that word embeddings learned by Jointly are not useful for entity search, and most of its performance comes from the TransE-based component. This situation is particularly dangerous for queries that do not have entity mentions, such as \"Who produced the most films?\" or \"What is the highest mountain?\".",

To achieve state-of-the-art results for ad-hoc entity search and to answer RQ3, KEWER can be combined with the BM25F-CA model [43] , which showed good results in [13] . We implemented BM25F by indexing entities with Galago using 5 fields (names, categories, similar entity names, attributes, and related entity names) for entity descriptions, as was proposed in [45] . Parameters of the model were separately optimized with a coordinate ascent on each query set using nDCG 10 as the target metric and 5 cross-validation folds from DBpedia-Entity v2. For each query, we scored the top 1000 results obtained with BM25F using MM (Q, e) score from Eq. (4). The parameter \u03b2 was optimized using crossfold validation by sweeping between zero and one with 0.025 increments and choosing the setting that results in the highest nDCG 100 on each fold's training set. BM25F results were not significantly improved by re-ranking them using Jointly, and we don't report these results. However, in our attempt to answer RQ4, we were able to obtain good results by applying word embeddings trained with word2vec's Skip-Gram with the hyperparameter values from Sect. 4.2, trained on the corpus of entity descriptions, where 5 aforementioned fields were combined into one textual description of an entity. The best results with word2vec for entity ranking were obtained when entity embeddings were obtained by summing up without weighting the OUT embeddings of words from their name (rdfs:label property), and IN embeddings were used for query terms with weighting.

In practice, calculating the softmax denominator of p(\u03be O |\u03be I ) is infeasible, and it is approximated using negative sampling. The objective from Eq. (1) is maximized using stochastic gradient descent to learn IN and OUT embeddings of size d with derivatives estimated using back-propagation. To better utilize cross-dependencies between IN and OUT spaces [20], we use a concatenation of IN and OUT embeddings for words and OUT and IN embeddings for entities. Thus, our final embeddings are vectors of size d * 2. Note that the proposed method can scale to large knowledge graphs, since all three steps of it are easily parallelizable.",
