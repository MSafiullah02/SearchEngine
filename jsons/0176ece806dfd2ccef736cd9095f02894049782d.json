Local reactions are often observed with vaccines administered via the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration, and there are concerns about the severity of pain, redness, swelling, in addition to formation of granulomas and abcesses at the injection site, necrosis and regional lymphadenopathy [ 3 ] . Vaccines might induce systemic reactions, including nausea, diarrhea and general malaise. Potentially severe responses might include anaphylaxis, pyrogenic fever responses, organ speci fi c toxicity, or immune-mediated toxicities (such as cytokine release, immune activation or suppression, and autoimmune diseases). Other potential concerns include effects on reproduction and development, and carcinogenicity. For live or attenuated pathogen-based vaccines, there is a risk of reversion to virulence in addition to concerns regarding administration of the vaccine to subjects who have an impaired immune system. For next generation vaccines which include adjuvants, there are potential synergies and interactions between the mechanisms of action for vaccine antigens and adjuvants. Adjuvants typically act by enhancing the immune response, and might cause excessive amounts of pro-in fl ammatory and pyrogenic mediators leading to an exacerbation of both local and systemic effects [ 3 ] . Next generation vaccines that are DNA-based or vectored have speci fi c risks of recombination and integration into the host genome. Therefore, the biodistribution, integration, and persistence of the DNA or vector are important evaluations for DNA-based and vectored vaccines.",

EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products issued a guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use, which covers the nonclinical and clinical aspects for consideration [ 16 ] . The safety pro fi le of an adjuvant alone would be typically impacted (positively or negatively) by its interactions with vaccine antigen(s) and needs to be evaluated in the context of the full vaccine formulation. A theoretical concern about increased toxicities due to synergy between adjuvant-induced responses and vaccine-induced responses has been raised by regulatory authorities. It is proposed that toxicological characterization of chemical-based adjuvants in a manner similar to all new chemical entities (NCEs) is desired in order to understand their unique toxicity pro fi les [ 6, 16 ] .

The doses tested would re fl ect the targeted clinical use, which is typically much lower than the maximum tolerated dose. The purpose of the toxicology studies with adjuvant alone is to establish a margin of safety rather than a maximum tolerated dose. Full necropsy and histopathology are included in the repeat-dose toxicity study. Similar to other NCEs, an assessment of genotoxicity potential of novel chemical adjuvants is also recommended using the standard battery of tests (e.g., potential for gene mutation, chromosome aberrations, and primary DNA damage) [ 28 ] . Carcinogenicity studies are not required for adjuvants, since they are only used a few times at low doses. An evaluation of the adjuvant's effect on reproductive toxicity is needed for inclusion of the adjuvant in vaccines that will be administered to women of childbearing potential or during pregnancy. 331 16 Strategies for the Nonclinical Safety Assessment of Vaccines Although the value of studies with an adjuvant alone for risk assessment of a vaccine as a whole is still being debated, in light of these guidelines, it is anticipated that the rigorous and comprehensive toxicology programs for novel adjuvants alone will be required in the future. Perhaps, a practical approach to compliance with these expectations by developers of vaccines containing novel adjuvants could include a generation of a \"Master File\" for a given adjuvant. With this approach, nonclinical safety studies with an adjuvant alone would be included in the Master File and potentially repetitive safety studies of that adjuvant alone could be omitted.",

This type of delivery system encapsulates and protects the antigen from degradation, and acts as a vehicle that mimics the structure of natural lipid bilayer membranes, allowing them to enter into the reticulo-endothelial system by endocytosis. Delivery systems could also stabilize the antigen and result in formulations that are thermostable. Delivery systems that are present in vaccine formulations need to be included in the formulation that is used toxicology study in animals.

However, rats are rarely used in nonclinical pharmacology studies that are focused on protective or therapeutic immune responses to a vaccine candidate. Instead, mice, rabbits and/or nonhuman primates (NHPs) are typical species in vaccine pharmacology studies based on available models of diseases and attempts to predict immune responses from animals to humans. In order to \"bridge\" the toxicology and pharmacology animal species, a measurement of immune responses in species selected for nonclinical safety evaluation (e.g., rats) to a vaccine candidate is included in a separate study or within a repeat-dose toxicity study [ 39 ] . This approach provides indirect evidence of the exposure and activity of the vaccine and is aligned with the general principle of all toxicology studies, in which the demonstration of the animal exposure to a test article following the administration of this test article in the course of a study is required. However, based on recent discussions and some regulatory guidelines [ 6 ] , there are additional expectations (if not requirements) for toxicology studies of vaccines, that is, the animal species should be sensitive to the pathogenic organism or toxin targeted by the vaccine-induced immune response. Addressing this expectation in toxicology studies may be problematic when the \"disease-sensitive species\" are different from the \"routine species\" because the former are not well characterized to provide reliable data to distinguish between \"background\" lesions relative to what may be considered a vaccine-related effect. Typically, a solution to this problem would involve the use of more than one species to evaluate safety of such vaccine candidate; for example, using a routine species in a well-controlled toxicity study (i.e., compliant with Good Laboratory Practice regulation) and a nonroutine species in an exploratory safety study, which is likely less comprehensive but with endpoints focused on pathogen-speci fi c concerns [ 23 ] . In both types of studies, the immune response to the vaccine should be demonstrated. The evaluation of the immune response to the vaccine relies on immunoassays that are developed in order to measure the most relevant endpoint, i.e. antibody response or cellular immune response. For the measure of speci fi c antibodies, standard ELISA formats or multiplex assays for multiple antigens vaccine candidates are often applied [ 40 ] . When the candidate vaccine targets the cellular arm of the immune response, assays measuring cytokine-secreting antigen-speci fi c T lymphocytes (such as g -interferon ELISpot) can be utilized [ 41 ] . These assays are typically developed and performed to support nonclinical pharmacology studies (e.g., using mice, rabbits, or NHPs), and then are adopted for the use in toxicology selected species (e.g., rats).",

However, as indicated above, the theoretical concern of synergistic immune stimulation seems to be heightened for novel, particularly \"molecular\" adjuvants such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists [ 43 ] and cytokines [ 44, 45 ] . The safety concerns for the use of immunostimulatory adjuvants include potential excessive pro-in fl ammatory and pyrogenic responses (IL-6, TNF a , IL-8, IL-1 b , PGE2); stronger or unexpected organ speci fi c toxicity (local in fl ammation, cell death, immuno-dysregulation); severe local reactogenicity (increased vascular permeability, cellular in fi ltration, fl uid accumulation); and break-down of self tolerance (dysregulation of T cells and other host cells). Therefore, the potential for a systemic in fl ammatory response for vaccines, particularly those containing 335 16 Strategies for the Nonclinical Safety Assessment of Vaccines immuno-active adjuvants, is expected to be assessed within the nonclinical toxicology studies. While there are several examples of animal safety studies conducted with a novel adjuvant alone or included as a control group for the toxicology study with a vaccine containing that adjuvant, including oligonucleotides (e.g., CpG DNA sequences [ 46 ] ), oil emulsions (e.g., MF59 [ 47 ] ), and saponinbased (e.g., QS-21 [ 48 ] ) adjuvants, they generally con fi rmed the expected dosedependent effects based on mechanisms of action, but did not reveal any fi ndings of toxicological concerns. In contrast, there are examples of unwanted immune responses in patients treated with experimental therapeutic vaccines in clinical trials. One example of adverse T cell-mediated toxicity induced by a therapeutic vaccine involved an amyloid-b vaccine AN1792, consisting of A b 1-42 amyloid antigen and the QS-21 adjuvant, used in clinical studies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease [ 49 ] . Symptoms of meningoencephalitis that were observed in some trial patients were not predicted by nonclinical safety studies and the cause of the unwanted immune responses was dif fi cult to establish. Based on some retrospective nonclinical studies using transgenic mouse models of the disease, it was suggested the inclusion of the QS-21 adjuvant in the AN1792 vaccine might have contributed to the adverse Th1 response, involving signi fi cant IFN-g , IL-4, and TNF-a expression [ 50 ] .",

It was reported that participants generally agreed that the primary objectives and design of current DART studies performed according to the existing guidelines are appropriate and no speci fi c changes were recommended. Furthermore, it was con fi rmed that no speci fi c immunotoxicological endpoints are necessary since the evaluation of antibody response to the vaccine antigen(s) in DART studies is adequate to assess an effect of the vaccine on the immune system in the treated mother and indirectly on the developing immune system of the offspring. Additional immune parameters should only be evaluated on a case-by-case basis where there is an increased concern for potential immunotoxicity. Also, if DART studies would reveal vaccine-induced adverse effects on either the pregnant/lactating animal, the embryo/fetal development or development of the offspring, further nonclinical studies to evaluate the cause of the effect should be conducted.

In vivo quality testing is conduced not only in support of marketed products but clinical materials as well as preclinical materials. The main goal of this type of testing is to identify issues that may have arisen during manufacturing (i.e., introduction of adventitious agents/contaminants, changes in potency and/or properties of cell substrates or other biological starting materials over time). The testing may also be used as a screening tool for biological materials that may have inherent characteristics that may affect their safety and/or tolerability (e.g., pyrogenicity testing on a vaccine candidate with bacterial components). Potential sources of contamination of biotechnology products include the original source of the cell lines or from adventitious introduction during the manufacturing process. Some examples of these sources of contamination (as listed in ICH Q5A [ 22 ] and USP <1050> [ 55 ] ) and the Product License. Other countries may also have speci fi c Pharmaopoeia (e.g., China, Japan, Brittan) so manufacturers should also consult these guidelines prior to marketing vaccines in these regions. Typically, the details of the testing contained in the Product License supersede the most current guidance documents unless speci fi c regulatory approvals are sought to update the license in question. For more speci fi c guidance for particular types of vaccines, cell substrates, or stages of production, additional guidelines are available (Table 16 .1 ). Guidance documents are also available for Regulatory Submissions [ 59 ] .

While this assay has utility for its intended purpose, it is unable to detect non-endotoxin pyrogens and false positive results may be obtained for vaccines that contain bacterial components. Therefore, the rabbit pyrogen test is still used for all products for which the LAL is inappropriate. In an effort to reduce animal use, the MAT, a novel in vitro assay has been developed and validated for the detection of both endotoxin and non-endotoxin pyrogens [ 71 ] . The assay involves the stimulation of a lymphocyte population in whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), or a reproducible cell line (MonoMac 6) by the analyte of interest and the measurement of cytokine release (IL-6, IL-1 b , TNF-a ). This assay is also listed as an alternative to the rabbit pyrogen test in the EP [ 72 ] . Some of the tests for adventitious agents also have in vitro alternatives. In vitro tests such as culture and PCR for the identi fi cation of Mycobacterium are, in some cases, acceptable as an alternative to the test in guinea pigs and the test in rabbits for the presence of herpes B virus in primary simian cultures may be replaced by a test in rabbit kidney cell cultures [ 20, 21 ] .",

The design of potency studies is fl exible and generally product-speci fi c and if an in vivo model is available, one may start with an animal (typically mouse) test with plans to move to an in vitro model proven to correlate with in vivo data in an effort to reduce animal use. It should be noted, however, that in vitro tests may not always correlate with clinical experience due to their ability to detect chemical changes that may not lead to functional effects on potency.",

            "text": "In vivo assays designed to detect neurovirulent potential in live virus vaccines have traditionally required the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in the Monkey Neurovirulence Test (MNVT). While this type of test remains appropriate for some neurotropic virus strains (e.g., polio and yellow fever), at a workshop in 2005 jointly organized by the International Association for Biologicals (IABs), the EP and the WHO, it was recommended that MNV testing no longer be required for established strains with proven safety records such as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella [ 73 ] . In fact, the EP monographs for measles [ 74 ] , mumps [ 75 ] , rubella [ 76 ] , and varicella [ 77 ] now require that only new strains of these viruses be evaluated for neurovirulence and that the test, in an appropriate animal model, be conducted during preclinical development only. In addition, FDA has removed the requirement for neurovirulence testing from the CFR [ 73 ] . In some cases, neurovirulence testing is required, for example, if inadequate data on neurovirulence of a virus for which a novel vaccine is being developed, if neurotropism or neurovirulence is apparent, or if a novel vaccine has been attenuated by passage in neuronal tissue. However, novel models for neurovirulence testing that do not involve the use of NHPs are being pursued. For example, Rubin et al. have developed a neonatal rat model which has shown better predictive value than the MNVT in distinguishing between neurovirulent and attenuated strains of mumps virus [ 78 ] . Other test systems such as marmosets have also been evaluated and show some promise. Nonanimal-based testing methods have also been considered but full replacement of animal testing may not be feasible as the complexity of neurovirulent viruses may not be adequately re fl ected [ 79 ] . 345 16 Strategies for the Nonclinical Safety Assessment of Vaccines",

A limited understanding of mechanism of action of newly available vaccine adjuvants leads to increased concerns about their safety [ 3 ] . Nevertheless, many recent scienti fi c and regulatory discussions dedicated to this topic seem to indicate that currently recommended and applied approaches to nonclinical development, including toxicology studies, of vaccine candidates are appropriate and adequate [ 54 ] .
