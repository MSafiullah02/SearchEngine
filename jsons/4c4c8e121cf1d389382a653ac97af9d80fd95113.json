Increasing numbers of researchers fear that the virus will become a worldwide pandemic, which will cause fatal consequences. The most common signs and symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19; temporarily termed as 2019-nCoV) at onset are fever, a dry cough, shortness of breath, myalgia or fatigue, and dyspnea. Owing to the complexity of COVID-19, some patients may present with atypical ",

            "text": "A 57-year-old man, without history of respiratory disease, presented to the emergency department with a 3-hour history of hemoptysis in Hunan, China. He denied recent travel to Wuhan City, Hubei Province, or any exposure to 2019-nCoV. No supportive results were found in laboratory tests upon admission. A unenhanced CT scan of the chest showed a localized area of ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe (Fig. 1 ). This patient was admitted to the hospital with a suspicion of pulmonary infection or tuberculosis. Three days after admission, a small amount of pleural effusion was seen. No affirmative results were found in the drainage of pleural effusion. Hemoptysis was unable to be controlled after symptomatic treatments including hemostasis and antiinfection therapy. Eight days later, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that the GGO in the left upper lobe had evolved into consolidation (Fig. 2) . The GGO appeared on the superior segment of the left lower lobe. Bleeding was confirmed in the apicoposterior segment of the left Korean J Radiol 2020;21 (5) kjronline.org upper lobe by using a fiber bronchoscope on the 10th day after admission. Fever occurred on the 11th day and the patient reached their highest body temperature of 39\u00b0C. Dyspnea was present on 14th day and gradually increased. On day 18 post admission, the GGOs and consolidation in the medial aspect of the left upper lobe decreased, while diffuse GGO and consolidation increased in the remaining areas of the lungs. The patient showed diffuse haziness in both lungs, batwing appearance, crazy-paving appearance, and the air-bronchogram sign. GGO was also distributed along the peripheral or subpleural regions (Fig. 3) . The COVID-19 infection was eventually confirmed by a real time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain-reaction assay. The hemoptysis gradually decreased and the dyspnea was relieved with symptomatic treatment and antiviral therapy according to the Guidelines and Management for COVID-19. A chest CT scan showed that the consolidation in both lungs were obviously absorbed; the GGO region enlarged but kjronline.org the GGO density decreased on day 24 (Fig. 4A, B) . On day 29 post admission, GGO and a small patch of consolidation continued to be absorbed. Initial GGO on the first CT scan and the initial GGO and consolidation on the second CT scan in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe were obviously absorbed (Fig. 4C, D) . This study was approved by the ethics board of Hunan province Hospital, and the informed consent for present study was waived.",

The most common signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection at onset of illness have been reported to include fever, a dry cough, shortness of breath, myalgia or fatigue, and dyspnea (3) (4) (5) . However, hemoptysis was the only clinical symptom in this patient during the first ten days of the disease course, combined with the slow progression of lung lesions. Hemoptysis has been rarely reported in patients with COVID-19 infections to date (3, 6) , and thus, it has not been included in the Guidelines and Management of COVID-19, constituted by the National Health Commission of China. Hence, it is difficult to diagnose COVID-19 infections especially without obvious epidemiological exposure. After the onset of fever and dyspnea, combined with typical CT findings, the patient was rapidly diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia by physicians. This case indicates the complexity of the pathogenesis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 infection. Typical CT findings include GGO, mixed GGO, or crazy-paving patterns and consolidation of the peripheral or subpleural regions with bilateral lower lung involvements (7) (8) (9) ). An area of localized GGO in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe of this patient was not a typical CT finding of COVID-19 pneumonia. It is a challenge to diagnose COVID-19 infections from GGO with a unilateral, isolated, or non-peripheral distribution with the only symptom of hemoptysis, but without epidemiological exposure. The first consideration was blood in the alveoli or an atypical manifestation of tuberculosis upon admission. The typical manifestations of the COVID-2019 pneumonia appeared on the 18th day after admission. The two final CT findings corresponded to the absorption stage, in which the clinical symptoms improved after adequate treatment Moreover, initial GGO on the first and second CT scans in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe was clearly absorbed, which was consistent with the gradual improvement of hemoptysis.",
