            "text": "The innate immune system acts as the first defensive barrier against invading pathogens, using pattern recognition receptors to recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Pattern recognition receptors consist of toll-like receptor, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-like receptors and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002, Meylan et al., 2006). The RLR family is composed of RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2, all of which play important roles in recognizing viral RNA in the cytoplasm (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010). RIG-I and MDA5 both harbor a central DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain, two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The RNA helicase domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis (Yoneyama et al., 2005, Yoneyama et al., 2004). The C-terminal regulatory domain is essential for binding viral RNA (Cui et al., 2008, Takahasi et al., 2009). The two CARDs function via CARD\u2013CARD interactions with interferon promoter-stimulating factor 1, leading to the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and nuclear factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells (Belgnaoui et al., 2011), which finally induces type I interferon (IFN-I) production and triggers a series of initial antiviral activities (Stark et al., 1998). During viral infection, swift upregulation of IFN-I is critical to the host antiviral responses (Bracci et al., 2005). Specifically, the expression of RIG-I and MDA5 are greatly induced by IFN-I as a positive-feedback mechanism, which results in signaling cascade to promote antiviral response (Gack et al., 2008).",

            "text": "In mammals, RIG-I and MDA5 recognize distinct, but overlapping, families of RNA viruses (Kawai and Akira, 2007, Ramos and Gale, 2011). However, chickens lack RIG-I and this may provide a rationale for increased susceptibility to certain pathogens in comparison to ducks and mammals, such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (Barber et al., 2010, Karpala et al., 2011). This suggests that chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) may have an important role in chicken during viral invasion. Unlike ducks and mammals, chMDA5 is able to recognize both long and short poly (I:C) and induce IFN-I beta (IFN-\u03b2) expression (Hayashi et al., 2014, Karpala et al., 2011) and the expression of chMDA5 is upregulated and plays a role during infection with influenza. Interestingly, the expression of chMDA5 does not seem to be sufficient to prevent influenza proliferation (Karpala et al., 2011). A plethora of research exists pertaining to MDA5 function in mammals, little is known about the role of chMDA5 and the ligands that interact with chMDA5. Similar to mammalian MDA5, the expression of chMDA5 is enhanced by IFN-\u03b2 (Kang et al., 2002, Lee et al., 2012), but the molecular mechanism is not yet known. A greater understanding of the transcriptional regulation of chMDA5 is essential to elucidating the role of MDA5 in chicken antiviral response.",

However, in the present study, though both short and long poly (I:C) could evoke the activity of the MDA5 promoter, short poly (I:C) caused a lesser increase in expression. DsRed-expressing cells were present 24 h post-transfection with poly (I:C) in Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cells (Fig. 1C). The proportion of DsRed-expressing cells transfected with long poly (I:C) and short poly (I:C) were 18% and 10%, respectively (Fig. 1D). qRT- PCR results showed that long poly (I:C) dramatically upregulated the DsRed mRNA, which was accompanied by an upregulation of endogenous MDA5, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Shor poly (I:C) resulted in a similar effect, although the fold-change was lower for MDA5 and IFN-\u03b2 and short poly (I:C) stimulation failed to induce IFN-\u03b1 expression (Fig. 1E). Previous results in mda-5\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated that IFN-\u03b2 response to poly (I:C) was abrogated, while IFN-\u03b1 response was lower than the wild-type mice, suggesting that IFN-\u03b1 was partially independent of MDA5 (Gitlin et al., 2006). It is possible that the upregulation of MDA5 by short poly (I:C) is not enough to induce IFN-\u03b1 in chicken, as the results in this study indicate that chMDA5 preferentially senses long poly (I:C).",

            "text": "Several different viruses (IBDV, NDV and IBV) were used to infect Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cells, but only IBDV was able to activate the chMDA5 promoter (1% DsRed expression). Cellular expression of DsRed was coupled with apoptosis that was caused by IBDV infection. However, few cells infected with NDV (0.051%) and IBV (0.12%) infection expressed DsRed (Fig. 2A,B ). The level of DsRed expression was remarkably increased by the infection with IBDV (p < 0.05), as were the mRNA levels of endogenous MDA5 (p < 0.05), IFN-\u03b1 (p < 0.05) and IFN-\u03b2 (p < 0.05). In contrast, infection with NDV or IBV had no significant effect on the mRNA levels of DsRed, endogenous MDA5 or IFN-I (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the change fold (log2) of expression of DsRed, MDA5 and IFN-1 in an IBDV infection group (about 5\u201315) is higher than that in NDV infection group and IBV infection group (mainly under 3). The results could be partially explained by differences between single stranded and double stranded RNA, as previous study demonstrated that the expression of chicken MDA5 was highly upregulated during influenza infection, which is a single stranded RNA virus (Karpala et al., 2011). IBDV is a double-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Birnaviridae family and causes considerable economical loses in the chicken industry (Muller et al., 1979). In this study, the result supports previous reports that chMDA5 recognizes IBDV and the infection of IBDV (in vitro or in vivo) results in the upregulation of MDA5 and MDA5-related innate immune genes, including IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 (Hui and Leung, 2015, Lee et al., 2014, Smith et al., 2015). NDV, a negative-stranded RNA virus belonging to paramyxoviruses, which can infect most birds, including chickens (Alexander, 2000), is recognized by RIG-I in mammals. In this study, NDV failed to activate the MDA5 promoter and enhance the expression of endogenous MDA5 and IFN-I, in accordance with previous studies. It has been demonstrated that paramyxovirus V proteins can inactivate MDA5 by disrupting the MDA5 ATP-hydrolysis site and preventing the formation of the RNA-bound MDA5 filament (Motz et al., 2013). Moreover, the V proteins act as IFN-I antagonists inhibiting the increase of IFN-I and blocking binding of IFN to its receptors during NDV infection in DF-1 cells (Jang et al., 2010, Munir et al., 2005). As a result, the antiviral signaling pathway and the positive-feedback mechanism are blocked, which further inhibits the MDA5 promoter activity. Even so, several studies have reported that NDV induced the expression of IFN-I in chicken splenocytes (Rue et al., 2011) and macrophages (Sick et al., 1998) and this discrepancy is likely due to the different cell types used. IBV is a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the coronavirus family and causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in poultry (Cavanagh, 2007). Global gene expression profiling has demonstrated that MDA5 expression levels were dramatically increased in chicken kidney tissue infected by Nephropathogenic IBV, while IFN-I expression was not significantly increased (Cong et al., 2013). Furthermore, a previous study found that MDA5 was the primary sensor of IBV and delayed induction of IFN-\u03b2 in a cell type-independent manner (Kint et al., 2015). In contrast, the expression levels of MDA5 and IFN-I were not upregulated and the MDA5 promoter was not activated by IBV infection in the present study, which may be explained by the differences in virulence and adaptability of the IBV strain. In coronaviruses, 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA can disrupt recognition of the virus by MDA5. In addition, several proteins encoded by some coronaviruses are involved in counteracting IFN-I (Holmes and Darbyshire, 1978, Liu et al., 2014, Zust et al., 2011). Collectively, the response of the MDA5 promoter to virus inducers was consistent with endogenous MDA5.",

Importantly, the chMDA5 promoter could be used to express other antiviral genes, as its activity is extremely low under basal conditions and can be modulated by exogenous inducers. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the importance of the 2.5 kb promoter of chMDA5. Our results provide a foundation for future research on the direct regulation of MDA5 expression, which could contribute in developing new strategies against viral infection.",
