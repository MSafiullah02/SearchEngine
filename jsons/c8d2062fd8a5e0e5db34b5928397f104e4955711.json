Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Lauer and Walker, 2001) . The treatment for CHC consists of pegylated IFN (peg-IFN)-\ue061 and ribavirin, complemented with the HCV protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir for HCV genotype 1 (Ghany et al., 2011) . A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to this treatment. The virological response to peg-IFN-\ue061 depends on the degree of activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver (Chen et al., 2005; Asselah et al., 2008; Dill et al., 2011) . Paradoxically, patients with a strong host response to HCV infection whose immune system reacts with a sustained induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the liver, in the following designated preactivated patients, are poor responders to peg-IFN-\ue061 treatments. Nonresponse to peg-IFN-\ue061 in preactivated patients is most likely the consequence of the permanent up-regulation of USP18, an inhibitor of IFN-\ue061 signaling through the Jak-STAT pathways (Malakhova et al., 2006; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009; Dill et al., 2012) .",

The presence of a T cell infiltrate in the liver of CHC patients suggests that IFN-\ue067 could stimulate ISG induction. However, several groups have reported that the CD8 + T cell response is dysfunctional in regard to IFN-\ue067 secretion (Thimme et al., 2012) . Indeed, gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant enrichment of IFN-\ue061induced genes in liver biopsies of preactivated We found a very low expression of IFN-\ue06cR1 in PHHs and in liver biopsies from patients who were not infected with HCV. In PHHs, IFN-\ue06cR1 expression was induced by IFN-\ue061, leading to substantially improved responses of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway to IFN-\ue06c. The magnitude of IFN-\ue061induced IFN-\ue06cR1 expression was significantly associated with the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype. IFN-\ue06cR1 expression was significantly higher in liver biopsies from patients with CHC compared with uninfected controls. Within the group of patients with CHC, IFN-\ue06cR1 expression significantly correlated with the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype. We conclude that the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype affects hepatic ISG expression not through differential expression of IFN-\ue06c3, but through differential expression of its receptor IFN-\ue06cR1. Moreover, ex vivo treatment of liver biopsies from patients with high-level expression of IFN-\ue06cR1 showed strong responses to IFN-\ue06c and poor responses to IFN-\ue061, whereas the contrary was found in patients with low-level expression of IFN-\ue06cR1. These findings provide a rationale for treating peg-IFN-\ue061 nonresponder patients with peg-IFN-\ue06c.",

We conclude that the major source IFN-\ue06cR1 receptor mRNA measured by qPCR from liver biopsy extracts are patients with CHC, contrary to the late phase of acute hepatitis C that is characterized by a strong enrichment of IFN-\ue067induced ISGs (Dill et al., 2012) . However, IFN-\ue061s are probably not the drivers of ISG induction because IFN-\ue061 signaling is subject to a strong negative feedback inhibition by USP18 that would prevent long-lasting activation of ISGs (Malakhova et al., 2006; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009) . Interestingly, IFN-\ue062 signaling is not affected by USP18 to the same extent as IFN-\ue061, despite the fact that both IFN-\ue061 and IFN-\ue062 belong to the type I IFN family and bind to and signal through the same receptor, IFNAR (Makowska et al., 2011) . IFN-\ue062 produced by HCV-infected hepatocytes therefore remains a serious contender for being the driver of ISG expression in CHC. However, neither type I nor type II IFNs have been consistently detected in liver biopsies of preactivated patients with CHC.",

The molecular mechanisms that link the allelic variants of the IFN-\ue06c3 gene locus to nonresponse to peg-IFN-\ue061 and ribavirin are not fully understood, but the significant association of the minor alleles of the IFN-\ue06c3 polymorphism with the induction of ISGs in the liver demonstrates that the IFN-\ue06c system must be critically involved in regulating the innate immune response to HCV (Honda et al., 2010; Urban et al., 2010) . More recently, a novel TT/-G polymorphism near the IFN-\ue06c3 gene has been described that is even more strongly associated with spontaneous clearance and treatment response to peg-IFN-\ue061 and ribavirin in CHC (Bibert et al., 2013; Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . The frameshift variant -G creates a novel 179-aa open reading frame that was designated IFN-\ue06c4 on the basis of its protein sequence homology with type III IFNs (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . Recombinant IFN-\ue06c4 signals through the IFN-\ue06c receptor and has antiviral activity against HCV and coronaviruses in cell culture (Hamming et al., 2013) . It is presently not known whether IFN-\ue06c4 is actually produced and functionally important in the HCV-infected human liver. Interestingly, the newly discovered TT/-G polymorphism impacts IFN-\ue06c production in PBMCs. Treatment of PBMCs from patients with at least one -G allelic variant with poly(I:C) resulted in significant lower induction of IFN-\ue06c3 compared with PBMCs from patients homozygous for the major TT allele (Bibert et al., 2013) . How lower amounts of IFN-\ue06c3 can be linked to increased expression of ISGs in the liver or how IFN-\ue06c4 could cause a long-lasting ISG induction is presently unknown, but these exciting new findings further point to an important role of the IFN-\ue06c gene locus in the control of the host response to HCV. We therefore analyzed the expression of IFN-\ue06cs and their receptor IFN-\ue06cR1 (IL28R\ue061) in liver biopsies and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) from patients with different IFN-\ue06c3 genotypes.",

Furthermore, it has been reported that the promoter of IFN-\ue06cR1 contains a binding site for the IFN-\ue061 signal transducer STAT1 (Yang et al., 2010) . We therefore tested whether IFN-\ue06cR1 is an ISG in PHHs. Indeed, we found a significant induction of IFN-\ue06cR1 both on the transcript and the protein level within hours after IFN-\ue061 stimulation (Fig. 2,  A and B) . The IFN-\ue061-induced up-regulation of IFN-\ue06cR1 had important consequences for the responsiveness of PHHs to IFN-\ue06c2. Treatment-naive PHHs showed poor to absent phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to 100 ng/ml IFN-\ue06c2. The expression of IFN-\ue06c1, IFN-\ue06c2/3, and IFN-\ue06cR1 was measured in liver biopsy extracts from CHC (n = 53 for IFN-\ue06c1 and IFN-\ue06c2/3; n = 122 for IFN-\ue06cR1), non-CHC (n = 22 for IFN-\ue06c1 and IFN-\ue06c2/3; n = 53 for IFN-\ue06cR1), and HBV (n = 31) samples by qPCR. Red lines show the statistical median of the individual data points. Statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test: ***, P < 0.001. (B) IFN-\ue06cR1 mRNA was visualized by ISH in fresh-frozen liver biopsy sections using a specific probe coupled with alkaline phosphatase and then revealed by Fast Red substrate (excitation 530 nm, emission 590 nm). Signals (red dots) are predominantly located in hepatocytes. Some signals are localized close to sinusoids. Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). Shown are representative images from biopsies A795, A909, A622, and A606. The IFN-\ue06c3 rs12979860 genotype is indicated below the biopsy number. Pictures were obtained from two CHC patients homozygous for the IFN-\ue06c3 rs12979860 C allele (A795 and A909) and two CHC patients carrying one or two T alleles (A622 and A606). Shown are representative images from three sections for each patient. Bar, 20 \u00b5m. expression level of IFN-\ue06cR1. We conclude that in unstimulated PHHs, the IFN-\ue06cR1 expression level is low and IFN-\ue06c-induced activation of the Jak-STAT pathway is weak.

To investigate the influence of IFN-\ue06c3 genotypes on IFN-\ue06cR1 expression, we genotyped CHC samples for the rs12979860 and for the rs8099917 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found significantly higher IFN-\ue06cR1 expression in samples from patients having one or two minor IFN-\ue06c3 alleles (Fig. 4 A) . To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the association of the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype with IFN-\ue06cR1 expression, we genotyped PHH samples from 30 donors not infected with HCV (Table S1) , stimulated them for 4 h with IFN-\ue061, and measured the mRNA expression of IFN-\ue06cR1 and two well-characterized ISGs, i.e., STAT1 and RSAD2. In unstimulated PHHs, the expression of all three genes was low, independent of the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype (Fig. 4 , B and C). IFN-\ue061 treatment resulted in a significant induction of all three genes in all samples. For STAT1 had stepwise increased expression levels of IFN-\ue06cR1 and showed corresponding increases in Jak-STAT activation and ISG induction by C and D) . Of note, a significant increase in responses to IFN-\ue06c2 was only observed in clones with IFN-\ue06cR1 expression of >0.005 relative to GAPDH. Interestingly, IFN-\ue06c2-induced ISG expression in LR clone 2 and 3 cells increased over time during a 24-h treatment period ( Fig. 3 D) . This is in contrast to the IFN-\ue061-induced ISG expression that is typically transient because of the well-known refractoriness of IFN-\ue061 signal transduction pathways in Huh7 cells and liver cells (Larner et al., 1986; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009; Makowska et al., 2011) . In accordance with these published results, IFN-\ue061 induced only transient phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 3 E) .

We made use of the observation that IFN-\ue061 stimulation induced IFN-\ue06cR1 to variable degrees. When these cells were stimulated with IFN-\ue06c2 after incubation with IFN-\ue061 for 4 h, the strength of STAT1 phosphorylation correlated with the PHHs were stimulated with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\ue061 for 0, 2, 4, or 6 h. IFN-\ue06cR1 expression was analyzed by qPCR. Values are shown as relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Shown are the results from three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SEM). Statistical analysis was performed with the Student's t test: ***, P < 0.001. (B) PHHs isolated from two non-CHC donors (#231 and #233) were stimulated with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\ue061 for 4 h, and IFN-\ue06cR1 was monitored by immunofluorescence using primary anti-IFN-\ue06cR1 polyclonal antibody followed by fluorescein (FITC)-coupled secondary antibody. IFN-\ue06cR1 signal is shown in green and nuclear staining (DAPI) in blue. (C) PHHs were left untreated (lane 1) or stimulated with 100 ng/ml IFN-\ue06c2 for 15 min before (lane 2) or after (lane 3) treatment with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\ue061 for 4 h. Activation of the Jak-STAT pathway was analyzed with phospho-STAT1-specific antibodies by Western blot, with actin as loading control. Shown is a representative blot of four independent experiments. (D) PHHs isolated from two non-HCV donors (#231 and #233) were prestimulated or not with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\ue061 for 4 h before being exposed to IFN-\ue06c2 for another 15 min. STAT1 activation was monitored by immunofluorescence using anti-pY-STAT1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555.

The method was previously used and validated in liver biopsies with different fibrosis stages including cirrhosis (Duong et al., 2004) . The activation of the Jak-STAT pathway was assessed by immunostaining of fresh-frozen biopsy material with phospho-STAT1-specific antibodies. For each sample, confocal microscope pictures of three random fields were obtained and used to quantify the number of nuclei with phospho-STAT1 signals. The expression of IFN-\ue06cR1 was quantified by qPCR. Two liver biopsies from uninfected patients were used as controls. In these samples, IFN-\ue061 induced nuclear phospho-STAT1 signals in most cells, predominantly in hepatocytes, whereas IFN-\ue06c was ineffective (Fig. 6, A and B) .

In many of these samples, nuclear phospho-STAT1 signals were detectable already in the PBS samples, and IFN-\ue061 rarely elicited further responses. On the contrary, IFN-\ue06c was able to increase nuclear phospho-STAT1 signals in all nine biopsy samples with high IFN-\ue06cR1 (Figs. 7 B and 8). Based on these ex vivo data, we conclude that there is an inverse correlation between responsiveness to IFN-\ue061 and IFN-\ue06c in human liver of patients with CHC. Thus, we propose that patients with high-level pretreatment expression of ISGs in the liver, who according to previously published work often respond poorly to IFN-\ue061 (Chen et al., 2005; Asselah et al., 2008; Dill et al., 2011) , might indeed have better responses to IFN-\ue06c because of significantly increased expression of IFN-\ue06cR1.",

            "text": "In CHC patients, IFN-\ue06c1 and -\ue06c2/3 are detected by qPCR in about half of the samples, mostly at low expression levels. In agreement with published work, we did not find a correlation between IFN-\ue06c expression and response to treatment or the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype. We therefore think that we can exclude differential regulation of IFN-\ue06c1 and -\ue06c2/3 as the missing link between the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype and ISG expression. A very interesting alternative explanation has been generated by the recent discovery of a frame shift variant located upstream of the IFN-\ue06c3 gene (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . This variant creates a new open reading frame of 179 aa that has been designated IFN-\ue06c4. Despite considerable sequence diversity between IFN-\ue06c4 and the other members of the IFN-\ue06c family, recombinant IFN-\ue06c4 signals through the IFN-\ue06cR to induce an antiviral state against HCV and coronaviruses (Hamming et al., 2013) . It is immediately obvious that the exclusive production of IFN-\ue06c4 from the minor IFN-\ue06c3 alleles (more precisely from the ss469415590-\ue044G allele) together with the stronger induction of IFN-\ue06cR1 in the liver of patients with one or two minor alleles (Fig. 4) provide an attractive explanation for the high level of ISG expression in these patients. For the moment, IFN-\ue06c system as a key component of the host immune answer to HCV. However, the mechanisms that link IFN-\ue06c3 genotypes with spontaneous HCV clearance and with response to peg-IFN-\ue061 remained elusive. Important insights came from studies that linked IFN-\ue06c3 genotypes with hepatic ISG expression in CHC (Honda et al., 2010; Urban et al., 2010) . Differential activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver has previously been established as a major determinant of response to peg-IFN-\ue061 and ribavirin (Chen et al., 2005; Asselah et al., 2008; . Patients with an activated IFN system are generally poor responders to peg-IFN-\ue061 therapy. Therefore, an increased production and secretion of IFN-\ue06c from minor alleles compared with major IFN-\ue06c3 alleles would be an obvious explanation for the association of the minor IFN-\ue06c3 alleles with increased ISG expression in the liver. However, several groups have failed to find increased expression levels of IFN-\ue06c family members in the serum or the liver of patients with minor IFN-\ue06c3 alleles (Honda et al., 2010; Urban et al., 2010; Dill et al., 2011) . In the present work, we provide evidence that the link between the IFN-\ue06c3 genotype and hepatic ISG expression is based on differential expression of the IFN-\ue06cR1 receptor, and not by differential induction of the IFN-\ue06c ligands. The receptor is detectably expressed in all liver biopsies. The median expression value is significantly higher in samples from patients with CHC, and within the group of CHC samples, there is significantly increased expression in patients carrying the minor IFN-\ue06c3 allele (compared with the major allele) and in patients who were nonresponders to peg-IFN-\ue061 and ribavirin therapy (compared with patients who were cured by this treatment). These results are in accordance with previous published results showing an elevated expression of IFNLR1 in patients with CHC infection compared with controls and in Huh7.5 cells infected with HCVcc (cell culture-derived infectious HCV; Dolganiuc et al., 2012; Kohli et al., 2012) .",

Nuclei were stained with DAPI (in yellow). (B) Liver biopsies from patient B769 were incubated ex vivo in PBS or IFN-\ue061 for 15 min, and phospho-STAT1 signals were detected by immunofluorescence using anti-pY-STAT1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555. Images from fluorescence channels (red for phospho-STAT1 and blue for nuclei) were merged with the corresponding brightfield image. induction of IFN-\ue06cR1 upon IFN-\ue061 stimulation according to their IFN-\ue06c3 genotype (Fig. 4, B and C) provides an important missing link between genotype and phenotype. We propose that early during HCV infection the host innate immune system reacts with the induction of type I (IFN-\ue061 or IFN-\ue062) and/or III (IFN-\ue06c) IFN. In individuals with one or two minor IFN-\ue06c3 alleles, there is a strong induction of the IFN-\ue06cR1. This induction is maintained through a positive feedback loop, and IFN-\ue06cR1 remains constitutively induced together with hundreds of other ISGs. In this group of patients, peg-IFN-\ue061 is ineffective, most likely because of the permanent induction of the ISG USP18, a strong inhibitor of signaling through the IFN-\ue061 receptor (Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009; Fran\u00e7ois-Newton et al., 2011; Dill et al., 2012) . On the other side, in patients homozygous for the major IFN-\ue06c3 allele, the induction of IFN-\ue06cR1 remains below a critical threshold for the positive feedback loop, and ISG induction fades away. These non-preactivated patients are highly responsive to peg-IFN-\ue061, most likely because IFN-\ue061 signaling is not refractory.",

A phase 1b and a phase 2b study demonstrated antiviral activity in patients with CHC and minimal adverse events and hematologic effects (Muir et al., 2010; Muir, A.J., et al. 2012) . The 63rd Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases: The Liver Meeting. Abstr. 214). The better tolerability of peg-IFN-\ue06c1 is presumably caused by the restricted tissue distribution of its receptor. Lymphocytes or monocytes are unresponsive to IFN-\ue06c . The antiviral activity of peg-IFN-\ue06c1 is probably mediated through a direct stimulation of the IFN-\ue06c receptor on hepatocytes. In tissue blots, IFN-\ue06cR1 is detectable in the liver (Sheppard et al., 2003) , and IFN-\ue06c had antiviral activity and/or activated Jak-STAT signaling in several hepatoma cells lines and PHHs, albeit often with lower efficacy compared with IFN-\ue061 (Robek et al., 2005; Doyle et al., 2006; Marcello et al., 2006; Dickensheets et al., 2013) . In vivo, the response to IFN-\ue06c in the human liver has not been investigated. Interestingly, in the mouse liver, we and others have found very little IFN-\ue06cR1 expression and little to absent Jak-STAT stimulation in the liver in response to systemic application of mouse IFN-\ue06c (Sommereyns et al., 2008; Makowska et al., 2011) .",

Contrary to IFN-\ue061 signaling, IFN-\ue06c signaling does not become refractory during prolonged stimulation (Fig. 3 D; Makowska et al., 2011) . Moreover, the strength of IFN-\ue06c-induced activation of the Jak-STAT pathway is regulated to a large degree by the expression of the IFN-\ue06cR1 (Figs. 2, 3, 7, and 8) . Because IFN-\ue06cR1 is an ISG itself, the IFN-\ue06c system can undergo a positive feedback loop that can be maintained as long as there is a minimal amount of IFN-\ue06c ligands to stimulate the expression of IFN-\ue06cR1. In this context, our observation that PHHs from non-HCV-infected donors show a differential Table S4 . The IL28A gene shares 97% sequence similarity with the IL28B gene; therefore, we designed primers that specifically recognize both genes. The specificity of the PCR was assessed on 3% agarose gel. For in vitro experiments, gene expression was normalized to human GAPDH expression using the \ue044Ct method. For analysis in bulk tissues, gene expression was quantified using cloned cDNA (a gift from R. Hartmann, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark) as standard, and results are shown as copies per 40 ng of total RNA. Complete gene expression data from PHH samples are listed in Table S1 .

On the negative side, peg-IFN-\ue06c1 could have only limited efficiency in patients with an uninduced endogenous IFN system because of a below-threshold expression of the IFN-\ue06c receptor.
