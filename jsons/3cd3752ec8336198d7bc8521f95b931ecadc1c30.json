The only way to control this disease is to cut-off the route of transmission. After the confirmation of human-to-human transmission, the Wuhan Municipal Government announced travel restrictions in Wuhan, and population migration in Hubei Province continues to be monitored. The entire country is actively trying to prevent the spread of the epidemic. At the beginning of the epidemic, there were insufficient hospital beds for the patients in Wuhan, and a large number of patients were required to self-isolate at home. However, patients with COVID-19 under home isolation will transmit the virus to other people in the house via human-to-human transmission. This can lead to the entire household being infected with COVID-19. Therefore, home isolation poses significant risks to the population.",

Therefore, the government quickly built two large hospitals within a matter days, namely Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital. 6 Since then, mobile cabin hospitals have also been established. Chinese medical staff from outside of Wuhan continue to arrive in Wuhan to help in these new medical facilities ( Figure.1 ).
