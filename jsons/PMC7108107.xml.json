Multivariate models were first adjusted for sex, age category, time period (per quarter), and site; additionally adjusted for all microorganisms detected in nasopharyngeal swabs; then stratified by age category using separate models. Finally, multivariate logistic modeling was undertaken by site adjusting for sex, age category, time period, and other microorganisms. Adjusted population attributable fraction (aPAF) was calculated for upper respiratory samples as blood RT-PCR data were not available for controls. Conceptually, aPAF estimates proportional reduction if an individual pathogen is absent [19], and was calculated with \u201cpunafcc\u201d function of Stata using adjusted OR (aOR) of multivariate models adjusted for all pathogens tested for pooled analysis, as in site- and age-stratified analysis [20]. Among pneumonia cases positive for a particular pathogen, the proportion of disease not attributable to the background rate is 1 \u2013 (1/aOR), that is, attributable risk fraction. The fraction of pneumonia cases that can be attributed to this pathogen (aPAF) is given by the proportion of cases positive for this pathogen multiplied by attributable risk fraction (Supplementary Materials 3).",

Pneumococcal carriage is linked to several risk factors, including age or family size [21]. While the models accounted for age, site, sex, and time period, residual confounders may exist. Pneumococci are commonly recognized as the primary etiology of pneumonia [22]. Pneumococcus vaccines have dramatically decreased the incidence of pediatric pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae in the United States [23], but only recently been introduced in several developing and emerging countries: 138 (71%) countries had introduced PCV by December 2016 (\u22642 years ago in 20 countries). However, most countries would achieve the same coverage of PCV as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis\u2013hepatitis B\u2013polio\u2013Hib vaccine. Therefore, preventive measures against S. pneumoniae\u2014mainly vaccination\u2014should be a priority. While PCV coverage was higher in controls, this study was not designed to analyze vaccine effectiveness [24]. WHO radiographic criteria for pneumonia were defined as a robust endpoint for PCV and Hib vaccine trials. This may bias our results toward bacterial causes, as viral pneumonia is less likely to present with lobar consolidation or effusion. However, we aimed to focus primarily on severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Most study sites had very low PCV vaccine coverage. Epidemiology may vary in developing countries with higher vaccination coverage; it would be useful to reassess pneumonia etiology in a few years to evaluate the impact of PCV vaccination.",

In our population, rhinovirus was significantly associated with pneumonia, with a high detection rate in controls. Rhinovirus was detected in 27% of American children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [25]. While under debate, growing evidence suggests a causal role for rhinovirus in pneumonia etiology [26\u201328]. Human metapneumovirus may also be important, and has been described as a common respiratory pathogen in children (particularly <1 year of age) accounting for 5%\u201310% of pediatric acute respiratory infection hospitalizations [29, 30].

            "text": "The aPAF is widely employed for chronic diseases, but rarely infectious diseases [21, 22], and is based on 2 parameters: prevalence of test positivity among cases and odds ratio. Its interpretation in infectious disease epidemiology is less demonstrated. In addition, most pneumonia investigations did not include control groups to account for carriage prevalence and imperfect tests. Thus, detection of several microorganisms in nasopharyngeal samples does not confirm a causative role. Blood RT-PCR results were not included in aPAF estimation, to prevent information bias [32]. Upper respiratory samples\u2014although not specific enough to diagnose etiology at the individual level as samples are distant from the disease site\u2014may help infer pneumonia etiology at the population level. This approach, which seeks to control the causes of incidence, is complementary to case-centered epidemiology and may guide global preventive strategies [33]. Multivariate models were adjusted for all pathogens tested, meaning that pathogens significantly or not significantly associated with pneumonia were retained. Nonsignificant results for some microorganisms suggest a lack of power to detect weak associations, the effect of chance (ie related to study samples), or bias. Advanced molecular diagnostic tools may be useful for epidemiological purposes, though their imperfect sensitivity and specificity may induce confusion between carriage and infection and miss some true infections [34]. Some viral agents were detected in upper respiratory samples consistently more often in cases than controls at all sites, with low detection rates in controls. However, detection of other viruses or bacteria using molecular diagnostic tools contributes little to clinical management [35]. In addition, the sensitivity of a nasopharyngeal swab is likely to be higher for pneumonia cases because of larger mucous volumes due to symptoms such as coryza [34].",

While difficulties were encountered related to its multicultural context, this project enabled construction of a decentralized infectious disease research network in developing countries [13]. Multicentric design and inclusion of countries bearing the majority of global pneumonia burden would permit generalization of these results to other developing countries. We identified similarities in the leading pathogens across countries. Multivariate analysis accounted for baseline levels of carriage in controls and estimated the independent contribution of each pathogen. However, residual confounding might persist if the sensitivity of respiratory samples varies depending on the microorganism. Among pathogens with strong positive associations (eg, S. pneumoniae, RSV, hMPV), adjustment increased the OR, suggesting that other pathogens may be \u201cprotective\u201d and simultaneously associated with index pathogen carriage\u2014or other pathogens may be a pneumonia risk with a negative association between pathogens, as described for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae [21]. Finally, despite exclusion of patients with respiratory signs from controls, analyses permitted adjustment for respiratory carriage in non-infected children.",

The sample size was relatively small to estimate site-specific differences and the number of cases varied between sites, which could lead to geographical confounding. However, pooled analyses were adjusted by study site. Second, case definition was amended due to the difficulties of enrolling patients without wheezing, which could have jeopardized internal validity. However, the data remained robust in sensitivity analyses after successively excluding individual sites or cases with wheezing. Sensitivity analysis after exclusion of cases with prehospital antibiotic exposure suggests that the importance of S. pneumoniae and RSV in pneumonia might be underestimated and that of rhinovirus overestimated. Seasonal enrollment discrepancies were observed at some sites; although the multivariate models were adjusted for this potential limitation, residual cofounding might persist. Publication of the large Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study will help assess the validity and causality of both studies [36]. In addition, a possible higher detection rate of bacteria\u2014principally S. pneumoniae but possibly other microorganisms\u2014in patients with coryza would lead to misclassification bias regarding this bacterium. Indeed, it may be easier to identify nucleic acid if the respiratory sample is voluminous. Finally, although causality is difficult to approach, our results are consistent with other estimations [1, 2].",
