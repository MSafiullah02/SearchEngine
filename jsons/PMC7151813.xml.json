To accomplish these functions, accurate information is required on the prevalence and incidence of disease events and risk factors as well as the extent of environmental health hazards. A major method of obtaining this information is from surveillance data gathered through mandated reporting systems. These data, reported by clinicians, laboratories, and others, are used to identify emerging diseases, plan for disasters, track trends, and evaluate progress of intervention strategies.

            "text": "The CDC, in cooperation with the American Veterinary Medical Association, has prepared a set of detailed guidelines for animal health professionals managing animals in emergency shelters and other facilities after a natural disaster (Figure 13-6\n).11 These guidelines are provided in Box 13-4\n.BOX 13-4CDC Guidelines for Animal Health and Control of Disease Transmission in Pet SheltersThese interim guidelines have been developed by consultation between the American Veterinary Medical Association and the CDC and are advisory in nature. They are intended to provide guidance for the care of animals entering shelters and for persons working with or handling the animals in response to natural disasters.Animals arriving at shelters as a result of a natural disaster need special care. Because they may have been exposed to contaminated water and may not have had access to safe food and fresh water, many are stressed and dehydrated and some may be injured and/or ill. Stressed animals may or may not show signs of illness and may also exhibit behavioral disorders. Following some simple animal management and disease control guidelines can help improve animal health and reduce the risk of disease transmission and injury between animals and people.What follows are some recommendations for pets arriving at animal shelters.Animal Health History, Examinations, and Identification\n\u2022Each animal should be examined at a triage site. Particular attention should be paid to hydration status, cuts and abrasions, paw/hoof/foot health (e.g., pads and claws, area between toes), ear health (e.g., redness, discharge), oral injuries (may have occurred if animal was foraging for food), vomiting and/or diarrhea, respiratory disease, and evidence of parasite infestation.\u2022Animals should be bathed upon entry, particularly if they may have been in contact with contaminated flood water. Commercial dish soap can remove petroleum and some other toxic chemicals, but care should be taken with use on sensitive species (e.g., horses). Those bathing the animals should wear protective clothing (e.g., rain suits, ponchos), gloves, and a face shield or goggles with a surgical mask to avoid mucous membrane contact with droplets and splashes that may contain toxic materials.\u2022Intake personnel should ask whether the pet has been in the custody of the owner since the beginning of the evacuation and should inquire about the animal's health and vaccination history, paying particular attention to any current medical needs or chronic health problems (e.g., diabetes, which would signal a need for insulin injections). In addition, owners should be questioned about the animal's usual temperament (e.g., whether the animal can safely be housed with others of the same species, whether it might be aggressive toward caretakers).\u2022A health record for each animal should be created and updated as needed. Identification information for the animal should correspond to that for the owner so that animals and their owners can be reunited. Owned animals should be clearly marked as \u201cowned\u201d and not \u201cabandoned\u201d to reduce the risk of mix-ups. Photographs should be taken, if possible. Collars (leather or nylon, not choke chains) containing readily legible identification information should be placed on all animals. Ideally, all animals should be microchipped.\u2022Cages should be clearly labeled so that newly arriving personnel are easily apprised of the health status and temperament of sheltered animals.\u2022Animals arriving without owners should be scanned for microchip identification. Microchips are most often placed between the shoulder blades, but earlier models were prone to migration, so animals should be scanned from the shoulder blade down to the ventral chest. All scanners are not capable of reading all microchips, so if multiple types of scanners are available, scan with each type before declaring an animal to be microchip-free. Animals without microchips should be checked for other forms of identification such as a tag or tattoo. Tattoos on dogs may correspond to an AKC registration number and this information should be used to trace the animal, if possible.\nAnimal Health Management and Prevention and Treatment of Zoonotic and Nosocomial DiseasesIntestinal Parasitism\n\u2022Dogs should be treated prophylactically for internal parasites, including Giardia, roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms.\u2022Exposure to mosquitoes in flood-ravaged areas presents an increased risk of heartworm disease. If possible, dogs should be tested for heartworms and appropriate preventatives or treatment should be administered.\nExternal Parasitism\n\u2022Dogs and cats should be examined for flea or tick infestation and treated appropriately.\u2022Preventive flea and tick treatments should be considered for all dogs and cats housed in shelters.\nVaccinations\n\u2022While the American Veterinary Medical Association normally recommends that vaccination programs be customized to individual animals, in disaster situations vaccination status may be difficult, if not impossible, to determine. For this reason, administration of \u201ccore\u201d vaccines to animals upon admission to shelters when vaccination status is unavailable or not current is considered appropriate. Vaccines take some time to become effective and will not address preexisting exposures, so personnel are cautioned to be alert for clinical signs of disease.\u2022A rabies vaccination should be administered to dogs, cats, and ferrets. This is especially important for dogs and cats housed in group settings. Personnel should be aware that rabies vaccines may take as long as 28 days to become effective.\u2022Additional core vaccinations for dogs include distemper, hepatitis, and parvovirus.\u2022Additional core vaccinations for cats include feline viral rhinotracheitis, panleukopenia, and calicivirus. Vaccination against feline leukemia should be considered for young kittens that will be housed in contact with other cats.\u2022Vaccination (intranasal) against Bordetella bronchiseptica and parainfluenza should be considered for all dogs to reduce the incidence of kennel cough.\u2022Because leptospirosis risk is higher in flood-ravaged areas and because the disease is zoonotic, vaccination should be considered. Personnel are cautioned that leptospirosis vaccines are serovar specific and that the potential for adverse reactions may be higher than for some other vaccines.\nDiarrheal Disease\n\u2022Animals presenting with (or developing) diarrhea should be separated from healthy animals.\u2022Nosocomial agents of concern that may be transmitted by feces include parvovirus, panleukopenia, Giardia, and intestinal parasites.\u2022Zoonotic agents of concern for small animals include Campylobacter and Salmonella, which are highly infectious and have been associated with outbreaks in shelters and veterinary clinics.\nIll Birds\n\u2022Ill birds are usually lethargic, depressed, and inappetent. Care should be taken when handling ill birds because they may be infected with the zoonotic bacteria Chlamydophila psittaci, which causes psittacosis. Face masks should be worn when handling birds of unknown origin that are exhibiting signs of illness.\nBehavioral Concerns\n\u2022Fear, panic, separation anxiety, noise and storm phobias, and other behavioral disorders are common problems in displaced animals. Animals that have never had these problems may develop them, and preexisting problems are likely to worsen.\u2022Providing housed animals with fresh food and water on a regular basis and establishing other familiar routines will help animals adjust to their new environment. Food and water should be provided at multiple smaller and dispersed stations, rather than a few large clumped stations, to minimize fear competition and fighting among unfamiliar animals.\u2022Animals without a prior history of aggression may snap, bite, or hiss as a result of fear or uncertainty. Shelter personnel should approach rescued animals calmly, but cautiously. Only experienced personnel should handle animals that exhibit significant behavioral disorders.\u2022Behavioral exercises and behavioral medications may be administered short or long term, as required, to help animals recover. Shelters are encouraged to seek assistance from qualified animal and veterinary behaviorists who can assist them in meeting these needs.\nEuthanasia\n\u2022Animals that are irreversibly ill or exhibiting intractable signs of aggression should be euthanized. Records should be kept of animals euthanized.\u2022Animals that have been previously associated with transmission of monkeypox (i.e., prairie dogs, African rodents) are under legal restrictions for movement except to a veterinarian for care. If one of these high-risk species is presented for veterinary care at a shelter, it must be kept isolated from other animals and housed in a separate cage. If this cannot be accomplished, these animals must be humanely euthanized.\nFrom Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Disaster recovery information: Interim guidelines for animal health and control of disease transmission in pet shelters. http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/animalhealthguidelines.asp.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has published guidelines for the prevention of occupational injury and illness among emergency first responders and animal rescue workers handling animals during a disaster.12 Identified health and safety hazards include animal bites and scratches, rabies and other zoonoses, sharps-related injuries, heavy lifting, skin rashes and other dermatologic conditions, animal allergy, latex allergy, noise, and pesticide exposure. Recommended steps to reduce these risks are shown in Box 13-5\n.BOX 13-5Guidance to Prevent Injuries and Illnesses from Working with Displaced Domestic AnimalsRecommendations for WorkersWorkers can reduce their risk of occupational hazards associated with displaced domestic animals by taking the following steps:Sanitation and Hygiene\n\u2022Wash your hands frequently with soap and water:\u2022Before and after handling animals.\u2022After coming in contact with animal saliva, urine, feces, or blood.\u2022After cleaning cages or equipment.\u2022Before eating, drinking, smoking, taking breaks, or leaving work.\u2022After removing gloves.\n\u2022Use alcohol-based hand sanitizers for cleaning hands when soap and water are not available.\u2022Change into clean clothing before leaving the workplace.\u2022Wear disposable outerwear or clothing that can be removed before leaving the workplace if clean clothing or laundry facilities are not available.\u2022Keep your nails trimmed to \u00bc inch and do not use artificial nails.\u2022Use personal protective clothing and equipment.\u2022Wear medical examination gloves that provide your skin with a protective barrier when handling animals, animal waste, cages, equipment, and pesticides.\u2022Wear two pairs of gloves if one pair alone might tear.\u2022Make sure that latex gloves are reduced-protein, powder-free gloves to reduce exposure to allergy-causing proteins.\u2022Use nonlatex gloves if you need or want to avoid latex.\u2022Wear cotton or leather work gloves as the outer pair when heavy work gloves are needed.\u2022Remember that cotton, leather, and other absorbent gloves are not protective when worn alone.\u2022Wear protective eyewear (safety glasses with side shields) or face shields if there is a risk of spitting or splashing of contaminated material.\u2022Wear sturdy clothing and protective footwear with nonslip soles; tennis shoes or sneakers do not provide protection from bite, puncture, or crush injuries.\n\u2022Wear hearing protection if you must raise your voice to talk to someone an arm's length away (e.g., when working in enclosed spaces with barking dogs).\nAnimal Bites and Scratches\n\u2022Complete the rabies preexposure vaccination series before directly handling dogs, cats, ferrets, or other mammals that may be infected with rabies.\u2022Thoroughly clean all bite wounds and scratches with soap and water.\u2022Report any bite injury to your supervisor.\u2022Immediately receive medical evaluation of any bite wound and the need for possible rabies postexposure treatment.\nOther Hazards\n\u2022Take precautions when using scalpels, forceps, and other sharp instruments.\u2022Dispose of sharp devices in labeled, puncture-resistant, leak-proof sharps disposal containers immediately after use.\u2022Do not recap, bend, or remove contaminated needles and sharps.\u2022Do not shear or break contaminated needles.\n\u2022Take precautions when lifting heavy or awkward loads.\u2022Use proper lifting techniques.\u2022Reduce the weight of loads when possible.\u2022Work together to lift loads that are unsafe for one person to handle.\n\u2022Pregnant or immunocompromised workers should avoid contact with cat feces and pet rodents to reduce their risk of zoonotic disease.\u2022Immediately report to the supervisor:\u2022Any needlestick or other sharps-related injury.\u2022Any symptoms of infectious disease or zoonosis.\u2022Any other workplace injury or illness.\n\u2022Consult a health care provider about any occupational injury or illness.\nRecommendations for EmployersEmployers should protect their workers from the hazards associated with working with displaced domestic animals by taking the following steps.\u2022Provide training in:\u2022Workplace-specific hazards, including bites and scratches, zoonoses, sharps-related injuries, heavy lifting, dermatologic conditions, allergies, excessive noise, and pesticide exposure.\u2022Good housekeeping, sanitation, hygiene, and infection control procedures.\u2022Animal handling procedures and use of equipment.\u2022The use and maintenance of personal protective clothing and equipment.\n\u2022Provide handwashing and sanitation facilities.\u2022Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers for cleaning hands when soap and water are not available.\n\u2022Provide appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment.\u2022Provide disposable outerwear or clothing if laundry facilities are not available.\u2022Provide medical examination gloves that provide workers\u2019 skin with barrier protection.\u2022Provide nonlatex gloves for those workers who need or want to avoid latex.\u2022Provide heavy work gloves or restraints for use with aggressive animals.\u2022Provide hearing protection for workers when needed.\n\u2022Provide preexposure rabies vaccination for workers with direct animal contact; only workers who have completed the preexposure rabies vaccination series should work with dogs, cats, ferrets, or other mammals that may be infected.\u2022Provide a medical surveillance system that monitors and records all occupational injuries and illnesses.\u2022Stress to workers the importance of reporting all work-related injuries and illnesses as soon as possible.\u2022Ensure that any worker with a bite injury is immediately evaluated by a health care provider for rabies risk and possible postexposure treatment and vaccination.\nModified from National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health: NIOSH interim guidance on health and safety hazards when working with displaced domestic animals. http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flood/pdfs/displacedanimals.pdf.
