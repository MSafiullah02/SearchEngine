In addition, all 65 poliomyelitis eradication officers in Angola, of whom six are international and the rest nationals, organised mobile teams for active surveillance in provinces at risk outside the outbreak zone to investigate and report suspect cases.",

These staff are concentrated in areas with the weakest health systems. Mainly because of financing constraints, the number of GPEI-funded surveillance officers is systematically reduced as countries are certified poliomyelitis-free, with some transferred to other international funding sources (eg, for activities to reduce measles mortality) or national government service. Poliomyelitis surveillance officers are usually medical epidemiologists who have been specially trained in poliomyelitis surveillance, case investigation and outbreak response, and are equipped with computers, transport, and real-time communication capacity through cell or satellite phones.",

Most recently, capacities have been broadened to include avian influenza. For example, in Kaduna State in Nigeria, poliomyelitis surveillance officers provided key messages about avian influenza to community leaders during poliomyelitis vaccination campaigns in early February, and poliomyelitis surveillance officers are now providing such messages throughout Nigeria. Poliomyelitis surveillance officers in Maharashtra State in India have been asked to report any information they obtain on sick or dying poultry to federal health authorities.",

Broadening the laboratory capacity to include diagnosis of H5N1 where feasible could provide wider support to the influenza-laboratory network.

Broadening the funding base for this unique international public-health surveillance and laboratory network could maintain its geographical distribution and ensure a stronger response capacity for any national or international pandemic of influenza. To ignore this dividend of the 20-year international investment in poliomyelitis eradication will increase vulnerability to avian influenza in countries where health systems are weakest and least able to detect and respond.",
