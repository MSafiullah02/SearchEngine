Erroneous declaration of the start might be understood as part of errors in risk assessment practice, and such an occasional error might not impose serious irreversible damage to our society. However, deciding the end of an epidemic is frequently associated with forthcoming changes in infectious disease control activities, and its decision imposes a pressure to epidemiologists to a certain extent. Declaring the end of an epidemic, the alert level in surveillance system may be downgraded, and working shift of medical and public health experts in charge of control practice (e.g. contact tracing effort) may also be restored [1]. In the case of the end of a vaccine preventable disease, the declaration would always lead to a discussion over the cessation of routine immunization [2]. The impact of the end of an epidemic is not limited to healthcare settings. Reduced volume of travelers may be recovered to normal due to declaration of the end of an outbreak, and thus, the declaration of safety would involve a pressure from tourism industry and have substantial impact on associated economics. In the case of an epizootic event of a veterinary disease, especially among livestock animals, the freedom from the epizootic disease indicates a permission to restart international transportation or trade of specific animals [3]. Getting along with these social and political interests, the end of an epidemic must be determined without serious errors and the announcement should be made carefully and appropriately.",

In particular, published studies have been mostly limited to a setting with single and brief exposure, e.g. a point source outbreak of food-borne disease. While methods are scarce, there have been multiple practical events on the ground that did require explicit methodological assistance in deciding the end of an epidemic. Nevertheless, it is also true that practical side has involved a number of complications that cannot be immediately addressed by epidemiological modeling only. For instance, many epidemics have involved a substantial number of asymptomatic infections, ascertainment biases and underreporting issues. In passive surveillance, diagnosed cases are notified to the public health authority. In addition to passive information, there might be datasets based on active surveillance (e.g. case finding effort through outbreak investigation) or laboratory testing of (a part of) possible exposed individuals, but their utilities have not been taken into account in the determination of the end of an epidemic. Moreover, one may ultimately wish to judge the end of an epidemic, not using notified case data but using other informative resources such as event-based or syndromic surveillance data.",

In that criteria, the outbreak of EVD is considered ended in any one of affected countries (e.g. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) after 42 days have passed since the last confirmed case has tested negative twice for the virus on blood samples. Along with this criterion, it has been also suggested that, after the 42-day period has elapsed, each country should maintain a system of heightened surveillance for a further 90 days, and ensure that ongoing EVD surveillance and notification thereafter will be conducted. Moreover, it is determined that the end of the EVD outbreak in the West African sub-region will be declared when the 42-day period has elapsed in the last affected country.",

Unfortunately, there has been no additional justification of using the incubation period and taking twice the empirical maximum, but the choice of a fixed length has been very transparent to public health societies and the criteria were made easy to follow for those working on the ground in West African countries.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, despite the simple and transparent fixed length, the classical approach suffers from a number of technical problems. First, the use of empirically observed maximum would be vulnerable to sample size of the incubation period. Namely, the greater the sample size, the greater the observed value of maximum would be [9]. Second, it is evident that the use of the incubation period is not justified for diseases that involve substantial number of asymptomatic infections [10]. There could be unrecognized chains of transmission among asymptomatic cases. Third, due to the shortage of objectiveness, the waiting period does not directly measure the probability of the end of an epidemic. For instance, it appeared that viable Ebola virus could be maintained in semen of infected males even after recovery from convalescent phase. A number of sexual transmission events have been reported to have fueled local reemergence of EVD, but such event has never been captured by the right tail of the incubation period. As a consequence, several erroneous declarations of the end of Ebola epidemic were unfortunately observed in West Africa.",

Another technical issue is that the prevalence is assumed to be a constant, and thus, the stationarity is inherently assumed. For the similar reason, it is quite unfortunate that the error probability of elimination is only based on binomial sampling error (without accounting for stochastic dependence structure in empirical data of cases).

As discussed in the second section, a widely acknowledged criteria of the WHO to decide the end of an epidemic has been to ensure no further report of cases, setting twice the long incubation period (i.e. 14 days for MERS) as the standard waiting period since the latest date of diagnosis or recovery. Adopting 28 days as the waiting time and count days from 4 July, the date on which the latest case was diagnosed, the earliest date that Korean government could have declared the end of outbreak was 2 August adhering to the WHO criteria. If we count the days from the last PCR positive date, the date of declaration would even have been in late December 2015. Nevertheless, to emphasize the safety to the nation as well as forthcoming international travelers at an earlier time, the Korean government made an original decision to announce the end of MERS outbreak on 27 July due to the fact that the last quarantined case was freed from movement restriction. To judge the appropriateness of these decisions, the probability of observing additional cases as a function of calendar time was explicitly calculated and such objective judgment was compared against that based on the WHO criteria.",
