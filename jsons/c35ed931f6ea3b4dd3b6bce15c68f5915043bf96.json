In addition, it was recognized early on that reverse genetic technology might also be exploited for practical purposes in medicine, to create new vaccines, and possibly also to combat cancer, taking advantage of the strong and often long-lasting stimulation of immune systems by viruses. Particularly promising was the use of attenuated viruses already widely proven in medical practice to constitute efficient and safe vaccines against their parent wild-type progenitors. Addition to their genome of genetic material encoding proteins or protein fragments of other important pathogens might result in multivalent vaccines mediating protection not only against the virus species used as vector, but also against the pathogens from which the added genetic information is derived.",

As outlined below, manipulated plus-strand RNA viruses were obtained rather easily, and among the more problematic negative-strand RNA viruses, those containing a nonsegmented genome (i.e., the ones grouped in the large order Mononegavirales ) were more difficult to get hold of than representatives containing segmented genomes.",

In this case, the rescue of virus was particularly easy, as the cloned DNA segment representing the sequence of the viral genome, simply flanked by oligo A and T stretches, was transcribed spontaneously after introduction into Escherichia coli cells by the residing RNA polymerase. Since the intracellularly transcribed genomes are first active as messenger RNA to produce all viral proteins and subsequently as template for the viral RNA polymerase/replicase to produce antigenomes, from which progeny genomes are then transcribed, progeny virus is formed automatically. It is still not clear by which mechanisms the primary transcripts containing additional nonviral flanking sequences give rise to progeny RNA containing the precise viral ends.",

The experimental hurdles to overcome were considerably higher in this case: (a) culturing the host cells was much more demanding, (b) the genome to be cloned was approximately twice as long, and (c) it was necessary to provide a promoter for residing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Nevertheless, due to some key properties similar to those outlined for Qbeta, progeny virus could be rescued spontaneously after introduction either of the properly constructed DNA or of in vitro transcribed RNA into host cells. This pioneering work triggered the rescue of a very large variety of plus-strand RNA viruses infecting vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and microorganisms. Even coronaviruses, the largest RNA viruses with genomes in excess of 30 kb are now amenable to genetic manipulation. Very similar experimental techniques could be employed for all positive-strand RNA viruses, despite their vastly differing propagation mechanisms.",

Vector use of most positive-strand RNA viruses suffers, however, from two major drawbacks. On one hand, the size of the introduced coding sequences is limited because of the space constraints in icosahedral viral capsids. On the other hand, the additional sequences introduced often survive in the original form only for a few viral generations. This was particularly evident for Qbeta and other RNA bacteriophages, which eliminate and/or modify added or altered sequences at an incredibly fast rate. The underlying reason is the strict requirement of suitable secondary and tertiary RNA structure for optimal RNA replication by the notoriously error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, usually defined as replicases. RNA structure is of paramount importance in all plus-strand RNA viruses, the genomes of which in the active state inside their host cells are naked or only loosely associated with proteins. In particular, deletions are introduced in their transcripts by recombination due to copy-choice transcription, which comes about by detachment of the replicase associated with the incomplete transcript from the template and reattachment to the template, preferentially at a location complementary to the last nucleotides of the transcript. Since RNA viruses with deletions of nonessential genome regions replicate more rapidly, such spontaneous mutants soon overgrow the original constructed genomes.",

Their genomes, which are complementary to sense strands, are not active as messenger RNA to produce the viral proteins, but are merely functional as templates required for the formation initially of mRNAs (transcription step) and subsequently of antigenomic RNA (replication step 1), which then acts as template for the synthesis of genomic RNA (replication step 2). Both transcription and replication are mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, also defined as transcriptase/replicase. The transcription step is characterized by the formation of less than full-length transcripts, which are typically both capped and polyadenylated, whereas in the replication steps unmodified full-length transcripts are synthesized. 2. The genomic RNA is only biologically active when it is present as ribonucleoprotein (RNP), i.e., associated with at least a nucleocapsid protein (called N or NP) and the viral RNA polymerase. In other words, the minimal infectious unit consists not merely of RNA, but of a specifically associated complex, the RNP. In the case of highly segmented viruses such as Influenza viruses, the polymerase is composed of three polypeptides. In Mononegavirales , it consists of only one very large polypeptide (L), frequently associated with a phosphoprotein (P), which fulfills multiple functions in addition to its role as polymerase cofactor, in particular as a chaperone mediating the attachment of N to genome or antigenome RNA as they are being synthesized. Thus, for rescue of virus from cloned DNA, it is necessary to deliver RNP to the host cells by one of two approaches. In vitro-made transcripts must be functionally covered in vitro by the viral proteins mentioned above before introduction into host cells. Alternatively, transcripts, on one hand, and encapsidating proteins (in large quantities) and viral RNA polymerase (in tiny amounts), on the other hand, have to be concomitantly synthesized in the host cells to form biologically active RNPs.",

Since the RNP of segmented negative-strand RNA viruses is structured relatively loosely, artificial in vitro transcripts of one cloned segment of an Influenza virus strain X could be encapsidated in vitro by the proteins required for RNP formation (nucleocapsid and the three large polypeptides forming together the viral RNA polymerase). When this in vitro-formed RNP was introduced into cells infected with Influenza virus strain Y used as helper virus, reassortants of Influenza virus could be isolated containing seven segments of the helper virus Y and one segment derived from strain X . However, a method was required to separate the small number of reassortants away from the large excess of nonreassorted helper virus. This was achievable by means of specific antibodies directed against the protein encoded by the segment of strain Y to be replaced. Although this work not only constituted the first breakthrough in this area, but also permitted the generation of some interesting designed Influenza virus mutants, experimentation was limited, since the necessity of a counter-selection step restricted the range of rescuable manipulated constructs. One decade of intensive work by several groups was required to elaborate a method enabling the rescue of Influenza virus entirely from DNA, i.e., without a helper virus (Neumann et al. 1999; Fodor et al. 1999 ). This method, using a large array of simultaneously cotransfected plasmids, specifying the eight antigenomic RNAs as well as the mRNAs for production of the proteins required for RNP formation, allows rescue of practically any desired Influenza virus compatible with the required biological properties of this class of viruses.",

There are three main reasons for this failure: first and foremost, the RNPs of Mononegavirales are much tighter and more rigid than those of segmented Influenza virus (indeed, in contrast to the latter they are completely resistant to RNase digestion). Second, the RNA genomes to be covered are much longer than the one Influenza segment being encapsidated by the original Influenza virus rescue procedure. Third, the extremely large and multidomain RNA polymerase (L) of Mononegavirales is more prone to nonfunctional aggregation than the three subunits of the Influenza enzyme. Consequently, many investigators reasoned that genomes or antigenomes of Mononegavirales should be encapsidated inside cultured cells in statu nascendi, i.e., while they are being synthesized artificially from a cDNA template by a foreign DNA-dependent RNA polymerase expressed in the host cells. Indeed, soon after the successful rescue of Influenza viruses, the first steps toward rescue of Mononegavirales were achieved: RNA minireplicons of certain members of this viral order triggered from cloned DNA were propagated in various cell lines. The DNAs underlying these minireplicons were initially derived by reverse transcription from natural defective interfering particles (DIs) generated spontaneously when Mononegavirales are propagated in serial succession at high infection rates. Later, minireplicon DNAs were constructed that minimally contained the noncoding 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-terminal signal sequences essential for virus-specific RNA replication; the viral genes were either partially or completely deleted and replaced by reporter genes for convenient detection of virus-specific transcription and replication (Collins et al. 1991 (Collins et al. , 1993 Park et al. 1991; Conzelmann and Schnell 1994; Sidhu et al. 1995) . Investigators used two kinds of helper viruses to provide the proteins to intracellularly encapsidate and replicate these minireplicons. In a simple approach, in vitro transcripts from the small cloned DNA segments were introduced into cells infected with the cognant parent nondefective virus. In a more advanced strategy, the DNA specifying the minireplicons were transfected, along with DNA encoding the encapsidating proteins nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), and the large polymerase (L) required for formation of biologically active RNP, into cells infected with a Vaccinia virus construct (vTF7-3), engineered to express T7 RNA polymerase at high levels. All DNAs contained T7 promoters; thus, this strategy allowed efficient transcription of all virus-specific cloned DNA segments in the transfected cells.",

This was first achieved for rabies virus (RV) . Using almost identical technical approaches, approximately 1 year later, two groups were able to rescue vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Lawson et al. 1995; Whelan et al. 1995) . Both RV and VSV belong to the family of Rhabdoviridae , the members of which are characterized by a sturdy bulletshaped virion structure, and by highly efficient, vigorous replication achieving high viral titers. Furthermore, their replication/propagation is only scarcely inhibited by the vaccinia-T7 helper virus. Thus, the tiny amounts of rescued virus could be isolated by a series of elaborate purification steps, including passage through filters.",

            "text": "Rescues Relying Exclusively on Transfected DNA Although the pioneering work described in the previous section established that functional RNPs of entire genomes of Mononegavirales can indeed be formed intracellularly, this approach necessarily had to fail in the rescue of measles virus (MV), a representative of the family Paramyxoviridae , which contains larger genomes, replicates to titer orders of a magnitude lower than RV and VSV, and forms large polyploid virions that are easily inactivated by chemical and physical stress such as filtration. Therefore, it appeared desirable to develop a rescue method avoiding helper viruses altogether, thus obviating the need for a purification step. This was achieved by relying only on transfected plasmids encoding N and P proteins as well as T7 RNA polymerase; transcription of these artificial mRNAs was governed by strong CMV promoters recognized by cellular RNA polymerase II residing in nuclei, rather than by T7 promoters. An intron and a polyadenylation sequence in the transcribed region of the plasmids was inserted to ensure capping, splicing, and polyadenylation, thus enabling efficient export to the cytoplasm as well as a long half-life of the mRNAs. It was clear that, despite these precautions, expression from a plasmid would allow a much weaker expression of T7 RNA polymerase than that achievable with vaccinia-T7. However, in the strategy chosen, the plasmids encoding the viral proteins N and P, which are both required in large quantities, did not rely on T7 promoters, as in the procedure enabling rescue of Rhabdoviridae . Thus, a relatively low level of T7 RNA polymerase was thought to be sufficient for the synthesis of antigenomic RNA and the mRNA encoding the large viral polymerase, which is required only in tiny amounts. It should be mentioned that, to maximize the chances of success, initially an approach involving two separate steps was employed. First, helper cells were stably transfected with the three plasmids endowed with CMV promoters encoding all three proteins: N, P, and T7 RNA polymerase. The plasmid encoding T7 RNA polymerase contained a neomycin (Neo) resistance marker, and among approximately 100 neoresistant colonies, two were chosen to propagate lines of helper cells, which, in addition to T7 RNA polymerase, express both N and P at appreciable levels. (These helper cell lines are still being used today by several research groups). Second, the helper cells were transiently transfected with two plasmids containing T7 promoters. One specified precisely initiated and terminated minireplicon (and later full-length antigenomic) transcripts; the other, used in very small amounts, encoded the large viral RNA polymerase L.",

In further experiments, successively longer viral antigenomic regions were added to the minireplicon sequence, giving rise to what is termed midireplicons. As can be expected, the CAT signal elicited became weaker with increasing midireplicon size. Finally, all of the missing antigenomic sequence was added, leading, at the end of 1994, to the first rescued MVs, which were clonally derived from single syncytia, thus constituting an additional benefit in comparison to rescues using a helper virus that yields mixtures of different clones (see Fig. 1 A) . This virus was denominated MV Edtag, as it had been tagged by three nucleotide exchanges in a nontranslated region, to distinguish it from the parent attenuated vaccine-derived MV Edmonston B type strain passaged extensively in many laboratories. However, it took more than 6 months before a patent application was filed, and almost 1 year for the first original research paper to be published , since all experimental procedures had to be verified by different collaborators, and the genetic stability of rescued viruses had to be ascertained by adding marker genes. Even chimera were constructed where the envelope proteins of MV were genetically substituted by the unique envelope protein of another virus, VSV (Spielhofer 1995; Spielhofer et al. 1998) .",

Standard cell lines able to support replication of the new virus are transfected simultaneously with all five required plasmids. (See Fig. 1B .

The reason for trying this strategy was actually dictated by Borna virus (BV) rescue. BV replicates in the nucleus; therefore, it was reasonable to test pol I and pol II promoters, and the latter proved to be optimal. The finding that this strategy was also successful for MV suggests that MV RNP can be formed in the nucleus concomitantly with the synthesis of antigenomic RNA by pol II, thus impeding splicing at fortuitous splice sites, and that RNPs then reach the cytoplasm rather efficiently. RNP formation in the nucleus appears likely attributable to the fact that N protein, when artificially expressed alone, migrates efficiently to the nucleus (Huber et al. 1991 ) and likely also carries along some associated chaperone P when both proteins are simultaneously expressed.",

            "text": "The first of these modifications consisted in a large deletion of 504 nucleotides, almost the entire 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the F gene , which is very GC-rich. In cell cultures, this mutant did not show any deterioration in propagation. No experiments in the animal models described in other chapters (ferrets, cotton rats, transgenic mice, and macaques) have been conducted to date, which might demonstrate that the deleted region is indeed dispensable for viability in infected model animals, and thus likely also in humans. (It should be noted, however, that in human thymus/liver implants engrafted in SCID mice, this mutant replicated somewhat more slowly and the virus titer reached was roughly ten times lower than that of the parent MV Edtag; Valsamakis et al. 1998.) Also, in the F gene of other representatives of the genus morbillivirus, relatively long 5\u2032 UTRs exist, although none with a comparable length. Recently, this region as well as the preceding long 3\u2032 UTR of the M gene have been reexamined in different cell lines, and it has been concluded that the former decreases F protein production, thus inhibiting MV replication and reducing cytopathogenicity, whereas the latter increases M production and promotes virus replication (Takeda et al. 2005) . One can speculate that the F protein in predecessors of MV might have been much longer; when a shorter functional version of F protein arose, the remaining untranslated region, rather than being eliminated as would be dictated by the maximal compaction of genetic material in RNA viruses, became the target of biased G/I hypermutation (Cattaneo et al. 1988; Bass et al. 1989) , resulting in replacement of U by C residues in the genome. (This type of massive mutational alteration has been observed frequently in defective M genes of MV triggering subacute sclerosing panencephalitis SSPE; Cattaneo et al. 1988 Cattaneo et al. , 1989b Cattaneo and Billeter 1992.) Maintenance of superfluous sequences in MV might only be a somewhat realistic hypothesis in view of the virtual absence of recombination by copy choice and by the obligatory adherence to the rule of six, hallmarks of all representatives of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae . (For a discussion of this rule, see the following chapter.)",

Interestingly, the Vmutant multiplied more slowly and the V overexpressing mutant more rapidly than the parent virus in human implants in SCID mice (Valsamakis et al. 1998) . Furthermore, Cand Vmutants appear to be overattenuated, since they multiplied poorly in Ifnar ko /CD46Ge transgenic mice, which express CD46 and are devoid of the interferon type I response (Mrkic et al. 1998) . However, all these results must be interpreted with caution; in the MV Edtag strain the C-terminal portion of V protein deviating from the P protein is already defective to begin with, by replacement of important amino acids (Cys272Arg and Tyr291His) conserved in all approved MV vaccine strains (Combredet et al. 2003) . Very recent studies with wild-type MV and derivatives lacking V and or C in macaques indicated that the defective MVs replicated less extensively, because they were more restricted by the interferon and inflammatory responses, whereas antibody and MV-specific T cell responses were equal for wild-type and variant viruses (Devaux et al. 2008) .",

In particular, generation of viruses containing premature stop codons by the error-prone viral RNA polymerase during repeated viral passages were to be avoided. In one approach, the foreign reading frame was linked to a downstream resident MV reading frame by a stop/restart signal, by overlapping a stop codon with an adjacent initiation codon [UGAUG] , as featured by influenza B viruses for the expression of the downstream NS reading frame. In the second approach, the protein self-cleavage featured by foot and mouth disease virus was adopted by (Hangartner 1997; Wang et al. 2001) . C Three different staining patterns of one syncytium is shown, induced by a triporter MV containing an eGFP ORF in position1, a beta-galactosidase (LacZ) ORF in position 2, and a CAT ORF in position 3 (Zuniga et al. 2007) linking the upstream foreign coding region with a downstream MV coding region through a stretch of nucleotides generating a very short polypeptide able to cleave almost exactly upstream of the MV protein (Ryan and Drew 1994) . By this design, the transgenic protein should bear a C-terminal elongation of 17 amino acids, whereas the MV protein should bear a single foreign amino acid at its Nterminus. In both approaches, the inserts were placed upstream of the L gene, which has to be expressed only at low levels. The first method did not lead to rescuable viruses, whereas the second approach did work and might actually be employed in particular cases (L. Martin, unpublished results) . However, since in a large variety of recombinant MVs mutational formation of premature stop codons was not found to actually be a problem, this approach has not been further explored in practice, at least for the time being.",

The most frequently used markers, apart from luciferase, are shown in Fig. 2 , which also illustrates the insertion sites and the levels of expression. The most frequently used marker is green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its various derivatives (Spielhofer 1995; Duprex et al. 1999a Duprex et al. , 1999b Naim et al. 2000) . In numerous publications not mentioned here, MV recombinants expressing markers have been used for a large variety of purposes.

MVs with either single or multiple insertions have been constructed, as shown only for a few examples in Fig. 3 (Zuniga et al. 2007 ). Most of the recombinants show replication properties in cell lines very similar to the parent empty MVs; usually the speed of propagation is only slightly delayed and the same end titers are reached. For the purposes of vaccine production, the slight delays are not counterproductive, but in the vaccinated host, a delay in propagation might result in a considerably reduced immunogenicity of the vaccine, which, however, could be counterbalanced Growth is plotted as a function of infectious viruses released (y-axis) and time (x-axis). Experimental conditions were as described previously (Wang et al. 2001; Zuniga et al. 2007 ). The cloning position of all antigens is illustrated in the lower panel . Abbreviations: tag Parent empty tagged MV (without ATU), rMV2env or rMV2pol MV with a single ATU containing SIV fulllength (anchored) envelope ORF or polymerase in position 2, rMV3env or rMV3gag ATU of SIV env or group-specific antigen (gag: capsid proteins) ORF in position 3, rMV2,3env, gag MV with 2 ATUs, containing a SIV envelope ORF in position 2 and a SIV capsid ORF in position 3, rMV2HN -MuVMV with a single ATU containing mumps virus hemagglutinin/neuraminidase ORF in position 2 by using higher viral doses. Given that the approved MV vaccines are administered in low doses ranging between 10 3 and 10 4 plaque forming units, this would be perfectly feasible in practice. Multiple inserts do not generally lead to more slowly growing recombinants than single inserts; the position of the inserts and the length and quality of the expressed additional proteins are much more important. Inserts at position 1 upstream of the N gene are most delaying, particularly if they are long. Glycoproteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are usually more problematic than proteins remaining in the cytoplasm; furthermore, membrane-anchored glycoproteins are more deleterious than excreted ones, probably because they tend to compete with MV envelope proteins. Nevertheless, only in one instance, when MV with inserts derived from mumps virus (MuV) have been tested, was the replication delay not tolerable for practical application. This was most likely due to competition between MV and MuV glycoproteins in the assembly of viral particles (Wang et al. 2001 ). As evident from Fig. 3 , the initial slow propagation of the recombinant expressing MuV H later resumed a speed similar to empty MV; however, the more rapidly growing virus turned out to have lost MuV H expression.",

When tested in Ifnar ko /CD46Ge mice (Mrkic et al. 1998) , where the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor is inactivated, the recombinants based on this laboratory strain replicate efficiently and are reasonably immunogenic. However, in macaques, even high doses of this strain are poorly immunogenic, in contrast to the licensed Schwarz vaccine strain, which elicits strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (Combredet et al. 2003) . It should be kept in mind that prior to 2004 in none of the published vaccination studies cited below were MV recombinants based on licensed vaccine strains used.

The recombinant expressing the small surface antigen (HBsAg) proved to be genetically stable for at least ten serial viral transfers, a criterion subsequently checked routinely for all recombinant candidate vaccines, and induced strong humoral immune responses in Ifnar ko /CD46Ge mice. A recombinant with inserts encoding both the surface and the core antigen from different cassettes in a single MV vector was also shown to express both proteins. However, this project was discontinued since development of a new HBV vaccine was deemed not to be commercially promising given that efficient vaccines against HBV already exist and that attenuated MV vaccine is not efficient in infants below the age of 6 months, whereas in developing countries chronically HBV-infected mothers usually transfer the virus to their newborns. Nevertheless, in a different laboratory, recently MV-vectored HBV vaccine candidates expressing the HBsAg have again been constructed (del Valle et al. 2007 ). The same insert as used previously was placed in a MV Schwarz-derived vector after the P, H, and L genes. In Ifnar ko /CD46 mice, the recombinants induced antibodies; as expected, the vectors with the P and L cassettes elicited the highest and the lowest immunogenicity, respectively. In macaques, only two of the four animals inoculated with the P cassette vector generated a humoral anti-S response. It was concluded that for optimal immune responses against the insert antigens, it is important to choose the strongest expression compatible with reasonably high replication speed of the MV recombinant, or that repeat vaccinations with the same recombinant, or prime-boost regimens using either protein with adjuvant or other viral vectors should be adopted. It is noteworthy that the recombinants protected the macaques as efficiently against challenge by wild-type MV as the commercial vaccine.",

In view of the high variability of HIV, particularly env has been manipulated in different ways, to get rid of highly variable regions and thus to expose mainly conserved epitopes. In an interesting early study, anchored env appeared to be preferable to excreted forms to induce neutralizing antibodies against several heterologous HIV primary isolates and to elicit cell-mediated immune responses (Lorin et al. 2004) . It is noteworthy that, as observed for HBV vaccine, MV preimmunization did not prevent these anti-HIV immune responses, as revealed in Fig. 4 . In several recent reviews, the potential of MV vectored vaccines in general, and in particular against AIDS, is discussed (Tangy and Naim 2005; Zuniga et al. 2007; .",

The DNA constructs underlying these segmented viruses were designed to bear precisely the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminal untranslated regions present in the parent MV. In addition to the MV genes, the 3 seg-MV could accommodate up to six additional transcription units, and efficient expression of five of the encoded proteins was demonstrated. Importantly, expression of a long insert encoding beta-galactosidase placed upstream of the N gene in a segment comprising only the MV N and P genes impaired the replication of the recombinant much less than beta-galactosidase residing in the same position of a monopartite MV. This suggests that long, multiple inserts could be expressed more efficiently when segmented MVs are used as vectors. The surprisingly efficient propagation can be explained by the fact that the MV particles grown in cell lines are largely polyploid (Rager et al. 2002) , containing far more than one genome. In addition, when relatively short genomes are replicated, the probability of the replicase to quit the template prematurely is lower than on long templates.",

Third, for the construction of tripartite virus, each segment should contain one of the genes required for replication, N, P, or L. (Ideally, to fully exploit the potential of segmented MV vectors, one segment should bear only one short transgene upstream of the measles genes encoding M, F, H, and L, whereas two segments encoding N and P, respectively, could bear multiple and relatively long inserts up-and downstream of the MV genes.)

The so-called quasispecies concept for RNA viruses was explored in an early study of bacteriophage Qbeta (Domingo et al. 1978) . Therefore, it came as a great surprise to find that in the MV recombinants the transgenes are rather stably expressed, although they are nonessential and in some cases deleterious for virus propagation and expected to be even more rapidly mutated than the MV genes conserved by positive selection. The expression of the first transgene studied in MV encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), inserted after the P and H gene, was completely maintained in all analyzed progeny clones derived from single original rescued clones after ten serial virus passages, which represent an amplification factor of 10 33 (Spielhofer 1995) . However, in that experiment, 35% and 100% of the clones derived from second rescued clones serially transferred in parallel had lost CAT expression. It seems likely that the errors already occurred in these second original rescued clones during transcription by the particularly error-prone T7 RNA polymerase. In almost all later rescued recombinants, the transgene expression was maintained. Only the expression of MuV-derived transgenes encoding MuV F and HN was lost, resulting in viruses propagating as fast as empty MV, whereas the freshly rescued recombinants were slow, as discussed above and shown in Fig. 3 .",

However, most of the DIs are the copy-back type, where the polymerase, after leaving the original template together with the unfinished transcript, attaches to this transcript rather than to the original template.

Nevertheless, it is surprising that ablation of protein expression, which could easily arise by nucleotide exchanges, leading to premature stop codons and thus interruption of the coding region, has not been documented. Single nucleotide deletions and insertions, which could also lead to truncation of the expressed protein, are virtually excluded due to the strict adherence of MV and all other Paramyxovirinae to the rule of six discussed above. Missense mutation in transgenes are obviously more difficult to detect than nonsense mutations, and to our knowledge for none of the inserts in MV have such events been excluded by sequencing after ten standard serial viral transfers.

In comparison with plasmid DNA, the efficacy is expected to be much higher, and in terms of safety it is certainly favorable that the danger of integration of genetic material into the human genome is negligible in comparison to delivered DNA or to DNA viruses. This expectation appears valid despite reported integration of cDNA derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) into mouse genomes (Klenerman et al. 1997 ). An additional advantage is the relatively small size of MV in comparison with DNA viruses used as delivery vehicles; only a few proteins of the vector are expressed in addition to those expressed from the artificial inserts, thus minimizing superfluous immune responses. In fact, the immune responses against the vector must also be considered beneficial, at least as long as MV is not eradicated, a goal of the WHO that will take many years to achieve and might never be reached. (Here it should be mentioned that in the opinion of some medical experts of MV vaccination in Africa, attenuated MV vaccination is generally beneficial for the development of the immune system in infants and therefore should be maintained even if measles is eradicated one day.) In comparison with RNA virus vectors, the high genetic stability of MV is noteworthy, which is shared with the representatives of the viral subfamily Paramyxovirinae , all representatives of which adhere to the rule of six, whereas the other Mononegavirales are somewhat less stable.

Replication-deficient vectors such as most DNA viruses in use and RNA virus vectors based on alpha-viruses are broadly considered to be generally safer. However, replication-deficiency entails two major drawbacks. On one hand, doses higher by many orders of magnitude in comparison with replicating vehicles have to be delivered. Even more importantly, the range of action is very limited, as only one-step infection of cells bearing suitable virus receptors at the place of delivery is possible. This contrasts significantly with attenuated MV vaccines, which owe their high efficacy to systemic spread and preferential infection of professional antigenpresenting cells and lymphoid tissues. In the case of MV replication, competence appears only as an advantage in terms of safety and efficacy, since MV vaccines have an extremely good safety record (MV vaccination is recommended even for immunocompromised patients, e.g., HIV), and severe sequelae of wild-type MV infection such as SSPE have been stopped by vaccination. Importantly, cell targeting of MV recombinants is not altered by transgenes (no envelope proteins, except MV-related glycoproteins as those of the MuV envelope have been shown to be incorporated into MV particles; Wang et al. 2001) .",

Therefore, vaccination with recombinant MVs was initially considered exclusively for young infants at an age when MV vaccination is recommended, thus replacing the standard vaccine with a bi-or multivalent vaccine protecting not only against measles, but also against other important diseases such as malaria. Such a regimen is certainly still a preferred option, and care has been taken to ascertain that in animal models various transgenes in MV do not hamper the immunogenicity against measles del Valle et al. 2007 ). However, measles immunity can be boosted in children who are preimmune after a first vaccination, particularly when the boost is given as an aerosol (Bennett et al. 2002) . Thus, it was probably wrong to assume that the immune reactions against measles in young infants, where the immune system is still immature, is necessarily similar in older children and adults. Since, for example, MV-based AIDS vaccines should be given much later, before sexual activity begins, it was important to ascertain, for the time being in animal models, that preimmunity from vaccination with standard MV vaccine does not prevent a boost with recombinant MV. In fact, boosts resulted in enhancement of immune responses against MV and induction of immune responses against the transgenes (del Valle et al. 2007; see Fig. 4 ).",

Thus, prime-boost regimens using either subunit vaccines with adjuvants or delivery with other viral vectors may be advantageous in practice. Adenovirus vectors should induce immune responses in newborns already and might close the gap until MV vaccines can be used. A particularly attractive regimen might entail vectors based on attenuated MuV, which, similar to MV, is being used widely for human vaccination. Furthermore, other vectors based on Mononegavirales and among those preferentially belonging to the Paramyxovirinae should also be considered. Representatives of all genera belonging to this subfamily and thus far unclassified viruses might be explored, as no cross-reactivity between these genera exists. However, attenuated MV and MuV are the only viruses for which extensive experience in humans exists, and are therefore preferred options for vector use, particularly since they are able, at least in principle, to induce life-long immunity.",

Nevertheless, it is difficult to understand why, in cases such as the polio vaccine mentioned in the preceding section, phase III clinical trials costing hundreds of millions of dollars would be imposed even for applying minor changes that would render the vaccine much safer; one cannot blame manufacturers for refraining from improving their product in view of the enormous costs entailed. Similarly, imposing such extensive and costly clinical trials might not be warranted for recombinants based on the widely used MV vaccines, provided that it can be rigorously demonstrated that any of the additionally expressed antigen is not toxic, the cell targeting of the recombinant virus is not altered by inserted transgenes, the immune response generated against measles is the same as in the traditional MV vaccines, and the manufacturing process is practically the same as that used for the traditional vaccine. It might also be asked whether society should not generally accept the prevailing principle of ethical behavior, i.e., maximizing the average benefits for the largest possible number of individuals. Risks accompany every human invention, and in many cases, such as traffic and sport activities, risks are tacitly accepted. Why is this not the case with vaccines? Rare adverse effects of medically active compounds, as routinely explained in leaflets accompanying drugs, are usually tolerated. Admittedly, vaccines must be considered differently, as they are administered to healthy individuals, particularly to children. Nevertheless, why should even highly adverse effects of vaccines not be acceptable, as long as such effects remain very rare, when severe morbidity and death can be prevented for large populations? Fact-based, nonemotional dialogue between scientists and society is clearly necessary. It should be possible to find acceptable legal and procedural solutions to this and similar problems even though at present in general the rights of the individual prevail over the rights of the community.",

In this instance, competition and financial avidity not only among companies, but also among scientists, has severely hampered progress. Patent offices must necessarily adhere to legal considerations, but research institutions should be amenable to compromises based on the recognition of scientific merit. Patent conflicts are costly and demotivating in general.

RABV, and particularly VSV and derived recombinants containing inserts, have the advantage of replicating to extremely high titers. Since the natural hosts of VSV are cattle, horses, swine, mosquitoes, and sandflies, human use is somewhat problematic, particularly since VSV shows some neurovirulence in primates (Johnson et al. 2007 ). However, VSV can be greatly attenuated by shuffling its genes (Wertz et al. 1998) .",

In part, this may stem from the relatively low titers obtained for MVs, to preexisting immunity against MV in the adolescent and adult human population, as discussed above, and suboptimal and/or expensive animal models. Clinical studies involving MV vectors for vaccine applications are only in the planning phase and are presently ongoing only with oncolytic MV recombinants requiring less strict previous testing. Thus, the promise of recombinant MV vaccines obtained in studies with animal models has yet to be corroborated in humans, the unique MV host. Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons discussed in this chapter, it can be predicted that the search for medical applications with recombinant MVs will rapidly gain momentum, as suggested by recent reviews comparing different viral vectors for vaccination purposes Brave et al. 2007 ).",
