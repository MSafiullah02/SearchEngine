An experimental platform was built to mimic the central air system, in which the efficacy of the newly built device was examined. In addition to the standard physical and chemical tests, bacteriophages were used to simulate airborne viruses in the experimental system. The bacteriophage suspension was aerosolized into the air with ultrasonic wave atomization. The result showed that more than 86% removal efficiency of micro-particles (<10 micron in diameter) were removed after the device was in operation in a building and more than 95% of bacteriophages in the experimental system. It is concluded that the integrated air purifier is suitable for controlling air quality and preventing virus transmission through the central air system.",

Some research indicated that the SARS virus was predominantlyspread by liquid droplets, and/or by direct and indirect close contact [2] . The central air-conditioning system has been considered as a probable means of SARS transmission in hospitals or office buildings. International scientific community has been in the forefront of fighting against SARS in discovering the means of SARS transmission and searching for effective ways of prevention [3 5] . Fresh air circulation can dilute the virus concentration inside a room and was found effective in preventing virus spread. But it cannot completely eliminate the SARS virus from an air conditioned environment. Thus, it is necessary to trap and kill bacteria and viruses in the central air conditioning system.",

It was built by integrating high voltage static electric field, ultraviolet ray, composite silver electrodes, and an active carbon fiber filter. Large particles can be first filtrated by active carbon fibers. Small particles and virus aerosols are mainly polarized and trapped by high voltage static electrical field. The silver electric plates of 10000 V high voltage together with ultraviolet ray completely kill the trapped bacteria and viruses within minutes. Upon binding onto the bacteria cell membrane, silver ion can penetrate and react with sulfhydryl (-SH) to damage the cell synzyme activity, leading to cell death [6, 7] . But the silver ion does not react on mammal cells because of the totally different cell membrane structure. The major emission band of the C waveband ultraviolet light is around 254 nm wavelength which is mainly adsorbed by nucleoprotein (>80%). When the nucleic acid absorbs high-frequency ultraviolet waves, the chemical bond of the nucleic acid molecule would be damaged, resulting in abnormal decompose or denaturalization to cause death of bacteria and viruses.

It is a key technology in this research to disseminate the bacteriophage stock culture in the air to simulate the virus aerosol caused by actions such as sneezing. Ultrasonic humidifier was used to evaporate the phage suspension to create the bioaerosol of the viral simulant. The bacteriophage suspension was aerosolized into the air with ultrasonic wave atomization. Aerosolization velocity was measured by quantifying the mass difference of the suspension before and after atomization per unit time. The effects of viral concentration, ion strength and viscosity of the viral suspension on aerosolization speed were also measured in this work.",

The deposition of particles onto the inner surfaces of the system were researched by measuring the PM 10 concentration in the center of the experimental test chamber with respect to time, to establish the baseline measurement.

            "text": "( ) Testing the sterilizing efficiency of the integrated air purifier. The ultrasonic humidifier containing bacteriophage suspension generated homogeneous bacteriophage droplets into recycling airflow. The GSM plates were used to collect bacteriophage particles in the airflow at the beginning and end site in the test tube with airflow at 2 m/s for 1 min. Each test repeated 3 times. The plates containing bacteriophage were incubated at 37 for 1 h to melt the gelatin. All the liquid was transferred to a centrifuge tube. 1 mL of the phage liquid was mixed well with 0.5 mL of the host bacterial suspension (at OD650 nm = 1.5). After standing still for 30 min at room temperature, the suspension was mixed with 5 mL melted soft agar and poured quickly onto LB plate. The solidified plates were incubated at 37 overnight. The number of plaques per plate was recorded to calculate phage particles collected. Fig. 3 shows that the PM 10 concentration decreases with time or without the air purifier in the experimental chamber. With the air purifier, the PM 10 concentration decreased from 77.6 to 0.5 mg/m 3 following an exponential decay over one-hour period while it took more than 5 h to reach the same level via natural deposition. To simplify the analysis, it is reasonable to assume that the air is fully mixed and the particulate concentration is uniform inside the test chamber. The air purifier has a filter system capable of trapping and retaining 71.35% to 99.36% of all mono-dispersed particles of 10 micrometers or less in diameter 1) when the effect of deposition, resuspension and adsorption with chamber inner surface are considered. The high concentration smoke particle was extraordinary irritant to eyes and nose of tester. The device helped eliminate the irritating smoke and odor in one hour. The pressure drop of the device meets the standard of a high efficiency filter which is around 126 Pa at 2 m/s wind velocity measured by an inclined tube micronanometer [9, 10] . According to the Indoor Air Quality Standard in China GB/T18883-2002 2) , the ozone in indoor air should be less 0.16 mg/m 3 . It is possible that the hydroxyl and negative oxygen ion might be ionized from water vapor in air with the high voltage and ultraviolet ray. The ozone density can be tested with ECO ozone monitor. Under the situation of using high voltage static electric field and ultraviolet ray, the ozone density fluctuated from 0.06 to 0.10 mg/m 3 , while the average ozone density is 0.08 mg/m 3 using high voltage static field only and 0.06 mg/m 3 using ultraviolet ray only. Therefore, the air purifier does not introduce the secondary ozone pollution. Fig. 4(a) shows that the plaques formed on a GSM plate were used to sample the airflow containing phage aerosol generated with a source suspension with 10 5 pfu/mL when the integrated air purifier was turned off. More than 100 plaques were formed in one such plate. Shown in Fig. 4(b) , less than 5 plaques were found in one plate when the integrated air purifier was turned on. A 95% bioaerosol removal efficiency was thus achieved with the integrated air purifier in action. After the treatment of the integrated air purifier, phage concentration in the airflow was reduced to a minimum. It is very important to assure enough accuracy for phage measurement at such a low concentration. In this experiment, removal rate of bacteriophage solely depended on the high voltage static equipment without active carbon fiber film, and no plaque was detectable when the system coupled with the active carbon fiber film. Thus, we need to increase the phage titer at the source suspension to ensure accurate detection of airborne phages. Fig. 5 shows the phage particles collected from the test tube with the air purifier on or off when the concenrifier was installed in place and turned on. The integrated air purifier reduced airborne viral particles by 2 4 orders of magnitude. It was demonstrated that the aerosol generation and sampling technology used in this work was able to evaluate the performance of the integrated air purifier effectively in a biologically and statistically sound way. tration of bacteriophage stock culture in the humidifier was at a titer of 10 7 pfu/mL with one minute sampling time. Through the statistic test, the difference of removal efficiency was significant under 0.5% degree of confidence with or without turning the air purifier on. The aerosolization and collection of phage particles were thus reproducible. When the test tube was void of any purifying measures, phage particles collected at the end of the test tube was (1.14 0.85) 10 5 pfu/plate, the number dropped to (41.2 58.5) pfu/plate if the integrated air pu- ",
