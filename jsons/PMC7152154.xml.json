During the past half-century three areas of investigation have given greater credence to the role of infectious agents, particularly viruses, in the initiation and/or exacerbations of multiple sclerosis: (1) epidemiologic studies indicate that multiple sclerosis is related, in part, to environmental exposure followed by a long latency period, and exacerbations of disease often follow virus-like illnesses; (2) studies in animal and other human demyelinating diseases have demonstrated a variety of mechanisms by which infectious agents can have long incubation periods, induce relapsing and remitting disease, and cause myelin destruction with relative preservation of axons; and (3) studies in patents with multiple sclerosis have consistently shown enhanced immune responses, particularly to viral antigens.",

Genetic factors are clearly important in multiple sclerosis, but monozygotic twins have only a 14\u201330% concordance, suggesting a major role for environmental factors. Assuming the pathogenesis of lesions is immunologically driven, what evokes the response remains unknown. Infections remain plausible explanations for the initiation of these responses and for the clinical and pathological features of the disease.",

Nevertheless, the arguments for or against a virus or bacteria in the cause of multiple sclerosis seems not one whit stronger or weaker than it was more than two decades ago. A shift has occurred, however, both in methodology and goals. New methods of detection, localization, and quantitation of infectious agents are now available, and the focus of studies has shifted to known agents rather than the search for a unique \u201cmultiple sclerosis virus.\u201d",

Since theories of humors causing diseases were still in vogue, he proposed that exposure to cold, physical injury, or emotional stress might bring on the disease. Over the subsequent 15 years, the work of Koch and Pasteur established microbial causes for many diseases. Thus, in historical perspective it is predictable that in 1884 Charcot\u2019s student and successor, Pierre Marie, proposed infections as the cause for multiple sclerosis (Marie, 1884). Indeed, in the afterglow of Pasteur\u2019s widely hailed discovery of postexposure immunization against rabies virus, Marie prematurely predicted a vaccine would soon be available for multiple sclerosis.",

Subsequently, Steiner (1952) reported similar organisms by direct staining of brains and spinal cords of patients. He named the putative agent Spirochaeta myelophthora. In 1957 another laboratory reported the cultivation of spirochetes from spinal fluids from patients with multiple sclerosis (Ichelson, 1957). This claim was confirmed and denied in subsequent reports but was finally settled by an extensive negative study using Ichelson\u2019s methods, except for the use of autoclaved water (Kurtzke et al., 1962).",

Enthusiasm ended when an oddly uninformative retraction was published by the clinician involved in the studies (Purves-Stewart, 1930, Purves-Stewart, 1931, Murray, 2005). On the basis of serologic tests Le Gac (1960) proposed a Rickettsia in multiple sclerosis. Even protozoa were implicated, with the reported recovery of Toxoplasma gondii from the spinal fluid and blood of patients (Bequignon, 1956). In addition, there were a number of reports of the transmission of neurologic disease to a variety of animals inoculated with the tissues and spinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis (Innes and Kurland, 1952). None withstood scrutiny or independent confirmation.",

Following measles and vaccinia virus infections, an acute encephalomyelitis occasionally develops that is characterized by perivenular demyelination of the brain and spinal cord. The neuroparalytic complications of rabies virus vaccines prepared in neural tissues bore a striking histopathologic resemblance to these virus-induced diseases. Thomas Rivers, the father of American virology, was intrigued by this similarity, and in the course of his studies with vaccinia virus, he inoculated monkeys with homogenates of normal neural tissue. After 6 months of repeated injections, several monkeys developed inflammatory demyelinating encephalitis simulating postinfectious encephalomyelitis and the neuroparalytic complications of rabies vaccines (Rivers and Schwentker, 1935). This was the first induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. The subsequent claim by Schaltenbrand (1943) of transmission of multiple sclerosis to monkeys presumably represented an independent finding of this phenomenon, since the inflammation and demyelination that he induced in monkeys followed repeated injections of human neural tissue.",

The antigens proved to be specific amino acid sequences of myelin proteins, the immunopathologic response was found to be cell-mediated, and the disease could be passively transferred with sensitized lymphocytes. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis became the prototype experimental autoimmune disease, and it simulates acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in humans (Johnson et al., 1984, Johnson, 1998).

The epidemiologic studies have continued to suggest an environmental factor, studies in animals and humans delineated more mechanisms by which viruses can lead to acute and chronic demyelinating diseases, and new methodologies have incriminated different groups of agents that may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. The optimism of the 1970s, however, has waned.",

Striking exceptions to the correlation of prevalence with latitude exist, such as the apparent absence of multiple sclerosis in Eskimos and a prevalence in excess of 150 per 100 000 in Sardinia (Montomoli et al., 2002). Whether prevalence in high-incidence areas has increased over time is uncertain.

Residence after induction and at onset of disease showed no significant correlation (Beebe et al., 1967). In a parallel case-control study of veterans of Vietnam and subsequent military service, interesting changes were found. Prevalence in women increased, prevalence in black men increased in comparison to white men, and the north\u2013south gradient persisted but was less marked. Attenuation of the latitudinal gradient over time was also observed in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, which assessed multiple sclerosis incidence among female nurses in the United States born between 1921 and 1946. Although the initial study demonstrated that women born north of 41\u201342\u00b0 north latitude had a 3.5-fold higher risk of multiple sclerosis compared to women born south of 37\u00b0, there was no such association in the follow-up Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, which included nurses born between 1947 and 1964 (Hernan et al., 1999). A systematic review of over 38 studies from Europe, Australia, and the United States also found strong evidence for a recent diminution of the latitudinal gradient (Alonso and Hernan, 2008). Overall, these changes in gender, race, and geography over a short interval can be interpreted as strong evidence for environmental factors rather than genetic factors in the cause or precipitation of multiple sclerosis (Wallin et al., 2004).",

First-degree relatives of patients have a 3% lifetime risk. Twin studies have shown a higher concordance rate, between 14 and 25% in monozygotic twins and 2\u20135% in dizygotic twins (Willer et al., 2003, Hansen et al., 2005, Ristori et al., 2006). This suggests that up to 70% of determinants may be nongenetic. Recent analysis of adoptees, half-siblings, and step-siblings in the Canadian Network of Multiple Sclerosis Clinics showed no increase in prevalence in these family members, suggesting the environmental factor or factors were not in the familial microenvironment (Sadovnick, 2006).

No cases were diagnosed before 1943; then 16 cases had onsets between 1943 and 1949, with several subsequent small waves of disease (Kurtzke et al., 1995). This gives the appearance of a point-source epidemic. The most unique antecedent event prior to 1943 was the 1940 occupation of the Faroes by the British, which leads to speculation that the disease was introduced by the British or their baggage. Detailed analysis showed a spatial relation between the homes of patients and the site of quartering of troops (Kurtzke, 2000). Notably, a recent examination of Danish National Health Service records of notifiable diseases in the Faroe Islands demonstrates a temporal association between acute gastrointestinal illness and the arrival of British troops (Wallin et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The age of acquisition of an infection may influence the clinical manifestations. For example, poliomyelitis viruses seldom cause disease in infants, but cause more frequent and more severe paralysis at older ages. Thus, improved sanitation, that delays acquisition of this enteric infection, increases the risk of paralysis. Parallels between the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis and poliomyelitis have been made (Poskanzer et al., 1963). However, travel from high-risk to low-risk areas increases incidences of paralytic poliomyelitis, a phenomenon that is not seen with multiple sclerosis. Disease associated with improved sanitation should have a later and later onset of disease over the decades. Similar analogies with varicella-zoster virus have been made with its opposite distribution; early infection is prevalent in temperate zones, and infections are less common and of later onset at more tropical latitudes (Ross and Cheang, 1995). A more convincing argument has been made for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), where early childhood infection in developing countries is not associated with clinical disease, whereas infection in adolescence and young adults is related to the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis. Later but uniform infection with the virus and a more frequent history of infectious mononucleosis have been found in multiple sclerosis patients (see section on EBV, below). In several studies patients with multiple sclerosis were found to have a history of measles and other childhood diseases at later ages (Sullivan et al., 1984, Bachmann and Kesselring, 1998), but these findings were not confirmed in a more recent study that minimized recall bias (Bager et al., 2004). The notion that lack of certain infections owing to improved sanitation may lead to multiple sclerosis via inappropriate responses to innocuous substances or subsequent infections later in life has been formally conceptualized as the \u201chygiene hypothesis,\u201d and has been proposed by some to underlie the higher incidence of multiple sclerosis in industrialized countries (Leibowitz et al., 1966, Fleming and Fabry, 2007). In support of this hypothesis, a small study demonstrated that parasitic infection can ameliorate the clinical course of multiple sclerosis and induce beneficial immune responses (Correale and Farez, 2007).",

One serologic study did correlate adenovirus antibody increases with attacks but not influenza viruses (Anderson et al., 1993). Another study compared years of onset of multiple sclerosis to epidemic influenza data and found a correlation of increased disease onset with influenza virus activity (Kazmierski et al., 2004).",

The clinical course is progressive, but can occur in waves with static periods before later worsening. During this clinical disease, the animals are afebrile, but their spinal fluids show a pleocytosis and elevated protein (Nathanson et al., 1985). Leukoencephalomyelitis of goats is caused by a related virus, but this disease has a more rapid clinical course (Cork and Narayan, 1980). The encephalitis usually occurs in kids less than 6 months of age, and paralysis or death may ensue within weeks. Again, the animals are afebrile during the disease with a pleocytosis and elevated spinal fluid protein. Pathology in both diseases is characterized by multifocal white-matter lesions that are most prominent in the periventricular and subependymal areas. Demyelination occurs with axon preservation, but in severely involved areas there is leukomalacia with cavitation.",

However, in studies of remyelination it was noted that new areas of subclinical demyelination appeared to be developing concurrently with remyelination of older lesions (Herndon et al., 1975, Herndon et al., 1977). The pathogenesis appears to be complex, with studies showing that late demyelination does not occur in mice lacking B or T cells, but does occur with transfer of virus-specific T cells or virus-specific antibodies (Stohlman and Hinton, 2001, Kim and Perlman, 2005). In addition, both monocyte-derived macrophages and microglia are present in regions of demyelination and can be observed to contact demyelinating axons (Templeton et al., 2008, Bender and Weiss, 2010). Thus, acute demyelination may be caused by direct lysis of oligodendrocytes, but persistent viral infection of glial cells may be capable of initiating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that cause exacerbations of demyelination.",

It is an acute respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in dogs often complicated by central nervous system disease that may occur acutely or weeks or months after recovery from the acute illness (McCullough et al., 1974). During the acute infection the dog is immunosuppressed, and there is little inflammatory response. Viral persistence, which is thought to underlie progression of inflammatory demyelination, is achieved through noncytolytic cell-to-cell spread, as demonstrated in astrocytes (Wyss-Fluehmann et al., 2010). Initiation of demyelination was previously presumed to follow glial cell lysis, but may in fact result from metabolic insufficiency of oligodendrocytes (Sips et al., 2007). In the late demyelination or relapses of disease, intense inflammation is found in the white matter. A paucity of viral antigen is found, but viral nucleocapsid structures have been identified in glial cells in the brain (Raine, 1976). Recent studies suggest that chronic inflammatory demyelination results from interactions between macrophages and antiviral antibodies (Vandevelde and Zurbriggen, 2005).",

In most patients it erupts abruptly days or several weeks after a viral exanthem or virus-like illness, but the disorder is not specific to viruses and has been seen after some bacterial illness, immunizations, and drug and serum therapies (Noorbakhsh et al., 2008). Fifty years ago it was estimated that one-third of all cases of clinical encephalitis were postinfectious. The commonest cause was measles, which, along with cases rarely associated with rubella and mumps, has been largely eliminated in regions where children are protected by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The second major cause of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was a vaccine, vaccinia virus, which was abandoned after the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1977. More recently the varicella-zoster vaccine has further reduced the risk of this disease. It is now estimated that less than 10% of cases of encephalitis represent acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. This exhibits a remarkable success in disease control by both introducing and eliminating immunizations (Johnson, 1994, Johnson and Major, 2004). The pathologic appearance is remarkably similar to that in the neuroparalytic complication in postexposure rabies vaccination and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Johnson et al., 1985). All three disorders have an abrupt monophasic clinical disease, similar perivenular inflammation and demyelination, and immunologic findings indicating sensitization to myelin proteins (Lisak and Zweiman, 1977, Johnson et al., 1984).",

Measles virus is known to infect peripheral blood leukocytes and to alter immune responses. The frequent secondary infections are thought to result from immunosuppression, yet the encephalomyelitis is assumed to represent a hypersensitivity response. Antibody response to measles virus is normal in both uncomplicated measles and measles encephalomyelitis, but lymphocytes from patients with measles show prolonged suppression of lymphoproliferative responses to mitogens. This occurs to an equal degree in uncomplicated measles, measles complicated by secondary infections, and measles with encephalomyelitis (Hirsch et al., 1984). The failure of mitogen responses and normal immune regulation appear to result from immune activations by the infection (Griffin et al., 1989). One result of this activation is the finding that a large percentage of patients with encephalomyelitis have lymphocyte proliferative responses in the presence of human myelin basic protein (Johnson et al., 1984), a finding analogous to that in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Thus, it appears that measles may interrupt the normal regulatory mechanisms that prevent responses to self antigens.",

The virus is cleared by the time encephalomyelitis develops, and virus cannot be isolated from the brain or spinal fluid, intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins against measles virus is not found (Johnson et al., 1984), and immunocytochemical staining fails to demonstrate measles virus antigen in the brains of patients dying at various intervals after measles encephalomyelitis (Gendelman et al., 1984). Thus, in this acute demyelinating disease, viral infection of peripheral immunocompetent cells appears to be the primary event; this leads to deregulation of normal suppression of responses against myelin proteins, and demyelination occurs without direct viral infection of neural cells (Johnson et al., 1985).",

By the mid-1990s approximately 4% of patents dying of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. With the routine use of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996, incidence and death rates of progressive multifocal leukoencephalpathy have gradually declined, though not reaching pre-epidemic levels (Christensen et al., 2010). The demyelinated foci show a loss of oligodendrocytes. Surrounding the demyelinated areas, the oligodendrocytes are enlarged and contain intranuclear inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus particles, often forming pseudocrystalline arrays (ZuRhein, 1969). Astrocytes within the lesions are often abnormal, multinucleated, and may contain mitotic figures. Astrocytes may express tumor antigen of JC virus but are not classically transformed, since some virus particles are found in astrocytes. No evidence of neuronal infection is found, with the possible exception of cerebellar granule cell neurons (Wuthrich et al., 2009).",

In this demyelinating disease it is not an aberrant immune response that causes demyelination, as in postinfectious encephalomyelitis, but a failure of immune responses that contain a ubiquitous latent infection.

In multiple sclerosis, both concordant and discordant losses of the two myelin proteins are found in acute lesions; this suggests that the mechanism of demyelination is not directly analogous to the other diseases (Gendelman et al., 1985), but may indicate that several mechanisms are at play in multiple sclerosis with some affecting oligodendrocytes and others affecting myelin directly.",

In viral infections with most enveloped viruses, virus-specified polypeptides were inserted in the plasma membrane of the host cell. If the oligodendrocytes are infected, antibody or cell-mediated immune reactions against these antigens could lead to oligodendrocyte lysis and demyelination. Alternatively, virus infection of the myelin-supporting cells could release myelin antigens into the circulation or myelin antigens could be incorporated into the virus envelope, and the virus would act as a vehicle to induce autoimmunity. The latter mechanism may initiate epitope spreading and recurrent autoimmune demyelination.",

In this scenario demyelinating disease could result from systemic or other organ system infections without involvement of the nervous system. This has not been incriminated in the diseases above, but sequence homologies between the nuclear ribonuclear neuronal protein in human nervous system and the tax protein of human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) virus has been implicated in cellular damage in HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (Levin et al., 2002). In support of this hypothesis in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, a single T-cell receptor from a multiple sclerosis patient was found to recognize peptides from myelin basic protein and EBV complexed with common multiple sclerosis-associated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles (Lang et al., 2002). Similar cross-reactivity has been observed between human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), influenza, and human coronavirus peptides and myelin epitopes, emphasizing the promiscuity of T cell\u2013peptide interactions that may promote autoimmunity following infection (Tejada-Simon et al., 2003, Markovic-Plese et al., 2005, Boucher et al., 2007).",

These startling findings soon were confirmed in over 30 subsequent studies. These confirmatory studies also found higher levels of serum antibodies against many other viruses, but the results were less consistent and less robust than the findings of measles antibodies (Norrby, 1978, Bray et al., 1983). Studies comparing levels of antibody in spinal fluid with those in serum rather consistently showed intrathecal synthesis of antibodies against measles virus, but abnormalities in the serum/spinal fluid antibody ratios have also been found for a wider spectrum of agents (Table 7.3\n). In one study, 23% of patients with multiple sclerosis had disproportionately high spinal fluid antibodies to two or more viruses (Norrby et al., 1974); in another study, simultaneous intrathecal synthesis occurred to as many as 11 different agents in the same patient (Salmi et al., 1983). In discordant twin studies higher serum and spinal fluid levels of antibody are usually found in the affected twin (Kinnunen et al., 1990).",

Subsequent studies of these isolates, however, have shown that they share extensive nucleotide homology with murine coronaviruses, suggesting that they are of mouse rather than of human origin (Weiss, 1983). The recovery of a flavivirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, in mice also can be assumed to be a contaminate, since hundreds of similar mouse inoculations have not yielded similar results (Vagabov et al., 1982).",

            "text": "Infection with this virus is almost universal, and the virus persists in latent form in B cells. In tropical and impoverished areas of the world, where multiple sclerosis prevalence is low, infection occurs in childhood and is essentially asymptomatic. In temperate zones and developed countries infection is delayed in many until adolescence or young adult years, and in these cases primary infection may be manifest by the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis. In numerous cohort and case-control studies a history of infectious mononucleosis was more frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis, and a recent meta-analysis estimates that infectious mononucleosis doubles the risk of multiple sclerosis (Handel et al., 2010). In many serologic studies multiple sclerosis patients are virtually uniformly positive for antibodies to EBV before onset of neurologic symptoms, although prior infection is not a prerequisite for development of disease in the pediatric population (Matyn et al., 1993, Haahr et al., 1995, Ascherio and Munch, 2000, Levin et al., 2003, Pohl et al., 2006, Banwell et al., 2007). A prospective study showed that persons who will develop multiple sclerosis exhibit an altered immune response against EBV with a high IgG activity to Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) in the absence of high activity to virus capsid antigen (VCA), and this is pronounced in the 5 years before clinical onset of multiple sclerosis (Sundstrom et al., 2004). In many other studies, serum antibodies to both VCA and EBNA1 are elevated. Notably, both seroprevalence and titers of antibodies to EBNA1 and VCA are increased in pediatric multiple sclerosis cases, indicating that infection precedes multiple sclerosis even in cases of early-onset multiple sclerosis (Pohl et al., 2006, Banwell et al., 2007). A recent meta-analysis that included numerous case-control studies of antibodies to EBV antigens found odds ratios of over 12 for EBNA-1 and over 5 for VCA seropositivity in multiple sclerosis patients compared to controls (Santiago et al., 2010).",

Another describes a 6-year-old with 11 episodes of relapsing disease and high titers of Epstein\u2013Barr antibodies. At autopsy typical multiple sclerosis lesions were found, and PCR of brain showed EBV sequences (Pedneault et al., 1992). Laser capture microdissection of meninges and white-matter lesions from multiple sclerosis brains followed by reverse transcription PCR has demonstrated the presence of EBV latency-associated genes in inflamed tissue (Serafini et al., 2010). In addition, EBV-encoded RNAs (EBERs), the small noncoding RNAs which are abundantly expressed in lately infected cells, have been found in multiple sclerosis lesions via in situ hybridization, although they are also present in cases of stroke (Tzartos et al., 2012). These findings in brain or spinal fluid are difficult to interpret, since EBV is latent in B cells. B cells are rare in normal brain or spinal fluid but do enter in inflammatory diseases (and are present in the lumen of vessels in brain sections). Demonstration of the virus in neural cells would provide stronger evidence for a causal relationship between this virus and multiple sclerosis.",

However, DNA was detected in spinal fluid by PCR (Wilborn et al., 1994), and the following year herpesvirus-6 DNA was reported in the majority of multiple sclerosis and control brains (Challoner et al., 1995). However, immunocytochemical staining showed a change of distribution: in normal brains virus antigen was found primarily in meningeal cells, but in multiple sclerosis lesions, adjacent cells, thought to represent neurons and oligodendrocytes, were positive. Subsequent studies have shown remarkable variance; some have correlated virus in blood or spinal fluid with disease activity (Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2004), whereas others have not. Different IgG and IgM responses have been reported, but other reports have failed to confirm this finding (Virtanen and Jacobson, 2012). The frequency of detectable virus in brain and the correlation with disease have been extreme, from reports of lack of detectable virus in diseased or normal brain tissue, to a claim that 90% of active multiple sclerosis lesions were positive for viral antigen while positive staining was found in only 13% of brain sections without active disease (Knox et al., 2000). Utilizing laser capture microdissection followed by PCR, Cermelli and colleagues (2003) found that herpesvirus-6 DNA was detected far more frequently in multiple sclerosis plaques as compared to normal-appearing white matter from multiple sclerosis patients or from controls. Using in situ PCR, Goodman and colleagues (2003) showed herpesvirus-6 genome in numerous oligodendrocytes as well as lymphocytes and microglia in acute multiple sclerosis lesions. Also with in situ PCR, Opsahl and Kennedy (2005) have shown herpesvirus-6 gene transcription in oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis patients\u2019 normal-appearing white matter, lesional tissue, and normal control brain sections. Viral mRNA was higher in white matter and lesions of patients, and viral gene expression was higher in samples from lesions.",

The characteristic presence of long terminal repeats followed by gag, pol, and env genes identifies their retroviral origins. These sequences are thought to represent ancestral infections in which integrated DNA is now passed on in Mendelian fashion. Comparisons to ERVs of apes and old world monkeys suggest that some entered our genome 25 million years ago (Voisset et al., 1999). No endogenous retrovirus has been convincingly linked to human disease, but the potential to enhance downstream cellular genes has led to speculation that they might be important in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type I diabetes (Perron and Seigneurin, 1999).",

Subsequently his group analyzed monocytes from patients and controls and reported evidence of retroviral activity or retrovirus particles in the majority (Perron et al., 1991) Recognition that the viral elements were endogenous, as opposed to an exogenous retrovirus, resulted in coinage of the name \u201cmultiple sclerosis-associated retroviral element\u201d (MSRV). Several other laboratories have found similar HERVs in blood and spinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients, and the presence of MSRV in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis has been associated with a greater rate of disease progression (Sotgiu et al., 2010). Although similar activity has also been found in other inflammatory neurologic diseases and schizophrenia, the frequency of HERV detection has generally been more frequent in multiple sclerosis (Dolei et al., 2002: Dolei, 2005). Of the over 30 HERV families named according to the one-letter code of the transfer RNA used to prime reverse transcription, HERV-W, HERV-K, and HERV-H have been most frequently associated with multiple sclerosis (Antony et al., 2011). Much recent attention has focused upon HERV-W, of which MSRV is a member. In addition, the protein syncytin-1, a glial protein that induces neuroinflammation and is expressed more frequently in multiple sclerosis than control brains, is derived from an envelope gene of HERV-W (Antony et al., 2004). Retroviral protein and virion production has been postulated to result from interactions with other viruses, including herpesviruses (Christensen, 2005). Specificity was further questioned in studies that showed HERV RNA levels increased with stimulation of macrophages in culture, and in brain in patients with HIV encephalopathy as well as in multiple sclerosis (Johnston et al., 2001). This study suggests that immune activity enhances viral expression rather than being a cause of the immune activation.",

They reported positive cultures in 64% of multiple sclerosis patients and only 11% of control patients, and positive PCR results in 97% of multiple sclerosis patients and only 18% of patients with other neurologic diseases. They subsequently reported that oligoclonal bands in spinal fluid could be partially or completely adsorbed by C. pneumoniae antigens (Yao et al., 2001). These reports have been followed by a plethora of reports partially confirming or refuting the results, but none with the robust results of the initial report. In a subsequent report, for example, PCR detected C. pneumoniae in 21% of multiple sclerosis patients, 43% of patients with other neuroinflammatory diseases, and none in healthy controls (Gieffers et al., 2001). A prospective serologic study of several large US populations showed that neither seropositivity to C. pneumoniae nor level of antibody predicted risk of developing multiple sclerosis (Munger et al., 2004). However, a meta-analysis examining over 70 studies found that multiple sclerosis patients were more likely to have detectable levels of Chlamydia DNA in their cerebrospinal fluid and intrathecally synthesized immunoglobulins compared to other patients with neurologic diseases (Bagos et al., 2006). A recent small study found that C. pneumoniae-specific intrathecal immunoglobulins were found more frequently in patients with progressive, as compared to remitting-relapsing, forms of multiple sclerosis (Fainardi et al., 2009). Overall, these reports support the hypothesis that the bacteria are passively carried into the nervous system when host macrophages traffic into inflammatory responses.",

            "text": "It has long been recognized that multiple sclerosis may arise as a result of interactions between environmental triggers and host genetic factors, the combination of which may influence disease susceptibility or expression. Much interest has focused on interactions between the strongest identified genetic risk factor for multiple sclerosis, HLA-DRB1*15, and viral exposure. The presence of high EBNA1 antibody titers was associated with a higher risk for multiple sclerosis among HLA-DRB1*15-positive individuals as compared with DRB1*15-negative individuals (Sundstrom et al., 2008), although several subsequent studies have not confirmed a direct interaction (De Jager et al., 2008, Waubant et al., 2011). Another major histocompatibility gene locus, HLA B7, was associated with increased anti-EBV VCA levels and worse radiologic markers of disease (Zivadinov et al., 2009). These studies support the idea that HLA genes may influence the risk of multiple sclerosis in part through the immune control of EBV infection. Notably, remote infection with herpes simples virus 1 was associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis in DRB1*15-positive children, while the reverse was observed in those who were DRB1*15-negative (Waubant et al., 2011). Active replication of human herpesvirus-6 in the serum of patients with multiple sclerosis was associated with a polymorphism of the MHC2TA gene, which encodes a transcription factor involved in expression of MHC class II genes, including HLA DRB1*15 (Martinez et al., 2007).",

Although prior infection with herpes simplex virus 1 was not an independent risk factor in a pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort, children seropositive for both herpes simplex virus and EBV were more likely to have multiple sclerosis as compared with children seropositive only for EBV (Banwell et al., 2007). Recent recognition of the vast numbers of commensal organisms that reside within an individual, termed the human microbiome, suggests that the manner in which microbes interact with each other and with the human genome to influence risk of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases is likely to be extremely complex (Ochoa-Reparaz et al., 2011).",

Infectious agents, particularly viruses, are the conspicuous candidates for the environmental factors in multiple sclerosis, but conclusive data are missing. Miscellaneous \u201cvirus-like\u201d illnesses often precipitate attacks, but this may have little relevance to the more important issue of causation. Viruses can during a transient infection initiate an autoimmune disease, as seen with epitope spreading in animal experiments. Viral infection of nonneural tissues can set up demyelination by molecular mimickry or immune deregulation. Viruses that activate coincident with exacerbations of disease may be important or nonspecific. Virus, though causal, may not be recoverable at the time of disease, as in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Studies have not provided the desired answers but have defined the complexity of the questions. Finally, it may be that the childhood exposure is not to an infectious agent at all, but to some other factor that leads to both demyelinating disease and abnormal production of viral antibodies.",

Historically a syndrome (signs and symptoms \u201cthat run together\u201d) was assumed to have a common cause, but advances in both genetics and infectious diseases repeatedly provide contrary evidence. In genetics one phenotype often proves to have many genotypes, and single genotypes can be expressed as different phenotypes. In virology the neurologic syndrome of \u201caseptic meningitis\u201d has proved to be caused by over 100 different infectious agents, and conversely single agents such as HIV, varicella-zoster virus and Treponema pallidum can cause a spectrum of clinically and pathologically distinct diseases. Gilden (2005) and Lipton et al. (2007) in recent reviews support the idea of a \u201csingle multiple sclerosis virus\u201d; but from a different vantage point one could consider some cases of tropical spastic paraplegia and Lyme encephalopathy with white-matter lesions dispersed in time and space. Before the discovery of HTLV-1 virus or Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, these patients\u2019 diseases fulfilled Schumacher\u2019s criteria for multiple sclerosis. With present knowledge do we now regard these as disorders where, in our ignorance, we erred in diagnosis, or should we consider these as a small portion of that multiple sclerosis syndrome for which we now know the cause?",
