In face of the health emergency, it is of critical urgency to find a cure for stopping the pandemic. Among the potential solutions currently under investigation, a combination bitherapy consisting of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine with antibiotic azithromycin has received special attention. Following initial reports from China indicating a potential effect of chloroquine (CLQ) [2], a preliminary clinical trial was implemented in France on a small cohort of COVID-19 patients [3]. A significant viral load reduction was observed in the 20 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH) [3], a CLQ derivative with increased solubility in water and decreased toxicity [4]. With the aim of preventing bacterial super-infection, six additional patients of this trial also received azithromycin (ATM) for five days. All these patients had undetectable viral load after 6 days [3]. Thus, although these promising data need clinical confirmation with more patients, CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy already appears superior to CLQ alone as a first line-treatment for COVID-19.",

In vitro studies have shown that CLQ-OH inhibits SARS-CoV-2 4, 5, 6. Far less is known about the antiviral effects of ATM, which has been suggested to interfere with influenza virus internalization [7]. Interestingly, CLQ is also considered as an inhibitor of endocytic pathways through an elevation of endosomal pH [8]. However, several reports indicate that CLQ could also prevent virus attachment through a direct effect on host cell surface molecules [9,10].",

            "text": "The very first step of human coronaviruses replication cycle is the attachment to the plasma membrane of target cells, which is mediated by a membrane protein receptor, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the case of SARS-CoV-2 [11]. Moreover, coronaviruses are also dependent upon sialylated membrane components such as gangliosides that act as attachment cofactors within lipid raft membrane platforms 12, 13, 14. As ACE-2 is localized in lipid rafts [15], SARS-CoV-2 infection requires specific targeting to these plasma membrane microdomains, where multivalent interactions between the spike protein and raft components can take place. In line with notion, lipid raft disruption through cholesterol depletion resulted in a significant reduction of human coronavirus SARS-CoV infection [15]. The recent identification of a potential ganglioside-binding domain in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and its potential role in membrane recognition [10], prompted us to study the molecular relationship between this domain, gangliosides, ATM and CLQ-OH. To this end, we used our molecular modeling strategy that has been successfully applied for unraveling the molecular mechanisms of protein binding to raft lipid components including gangliosides [16,17] and cholesterol [18,19].",

Lennard-Jones parameters and atomic charges of ATM obtained from pdb file # 5UXD were checked with Hyperchem. The molecular modelling protocol consisted of docking, equilibration, and subsequent 50-ns MD simulations with CHARMM force field [16,24] in Hyperchem. The starting point for ATM docking was done by manual positioning on the NTD and RBD surfaces of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (chain A) with full consideration of the drug's properties. In addition, a series of 20 randomly positioned ATM molecules covering the whole NTD surface were also analyzed. Energy minimization of each system was then performed with the Polak-Ribi\u00e8re conjugate gradient algorithm, with CHARMM force field in Hyperchem, using a maximum of 3 \u00d7 105 steps, and a root-mean-square (RMS) gradient of 0.01 kcal. \u00c5\u22121.mol\u22121 as the convergence condition. According to the validation ligand-binding protocol [25], the optimized docked structures were used as the initial structures for MD simulations with the following parameters: heat time 5 ps, run time, 10 ps, step size 1 fs, starting temperature 0 K, simulation temperature 300 K, temperature step 30 K, bath relaxation time step size 0.1 ps. Each complex was submitted to 50-ns long MD trajectories, replicated three times, with convergent trajectories obtained. Frames were saved at 10 ns intervals for subsequent analysis. The final complex obtained with chain A was reintroduced in the trimeric spike structure (pdb file # 6VSB) with Molegro Molecular viewer and with Deep View Swiss-Pdb viewer. Similar results were obtained with both programs. The energies of interaction were extracted from the Ligand Energy Inspector function of Molegro Molecular viewer. Molecular volumes were calculated by the QSAR function of Hyperchem.",

In the next step, we included the saccharide part of the ganglioside in a periodic box solvated with 1128 water molecules (dimensions: 34848 \u00c53 with x = 33 \u00c5, y = 32 \u00c5, z = 33 \u00c5). The system was energy-minimized 6 times switching alternatively between runs using steepest descent gradients or Polak-Ribi\u00e8re conjugate gradients until convergence to machine precision [16]. The dimer of ganglioside GM1 interacting with 4 CLQ-OH molecules was obtained by MD simulations of a previously described model [10]. To mimic GM1 gangliosides in a typical lipid raft membrane domain, two GM1 molecules were merged with eight cholesterol and two sphingomyelin lipids. The whole system was optimized, merged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (chain A) and submitted to MD simulations with the same conditions as those used for the ATM-spike protein complex (50-ns run in triplicate). For comparison, similar MD simulations were performed on an isolated GM1 dimer in the CHARMM-GUI membrane-compatible topology but without surrounding lipids.",

Interestingly, this volume is almost the same as the one of the saccharide part of ganglioside GM1 (2293 \u00c53, Figure 1b), a lipid raft ganglioside that plays a critical role in the binding and endocytosis of respiratory viruses [26], including pathogenic human coronaviruses [27]. Beyond their similar spatial volume, the saccharide part of GM1 and ATM also share some analogous chemical features including sugar rings and a solvent-accessible surface dotted with several CH and OH groups (Figure 1b).

The structural features of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion conformation [20] are shown in Figure 1c. It consists of three interdigitated spike proteins that provide the virus its typical corona like shape in electron microscopy images. In each subunit, the most distant part from the viral envelope is divided in two separate domains, the NTD and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The NTD has a flat surface available for ganglioside binding [10], and this process is independent from the ACE-2 receptor recognition which occurs at the tip of the RBD [11,20]. When seen from above, the viral spike has a typical triangle shape, with a ganglioside-binding domain at each apex. Thus, the spike central area is devoted to ACE-2 binding, leaving three peripheric flat surface areas available for ganglioside attachment. Such dual ganglioside/receptor binding is commonly used by pathogenic viruses such as HIV-1 28, 29, 30 and bacterial neurotoxins [16]. By combining the high affinity for a single protein receptor with multiple low affinity attachment sites, these pathogens have selected a very efficient pathway to gain entry into host cells.",

All other docking attempts on the NTD or the RBD of the spike protein were unsuccessful (Figure S2) as they did not satisfy the minimum cutoff values. Not surprisingly, their trajectories started destabilizing before 10 ns. In contrast, ATM #1 (colored in yellow in Figure S2) remained bound to the spike protein throughout the simulation process (Figure 3\n). It is interesting to note that a significant movement of the drug was observed from its docked pose to stable MD pose (dock-to-MD transition), especially during the first 10-ns of simulations (Figure S3). A stable complex association was then reached after 10 ns. We noticed that three amino acid residues, referred to as the \u201cQFN triad\u201d, exhibited significant conformational rearrangement during the binding process: Q-134, F-135 and N-137 (Figure 3). The principal moves consisted in a significant reorientation of the aromatic ring of F-135, from suboptimal stacking to stabilized T-shape CH-\u03c0 interaction, and a concomitant retraction of the Q-134 side chain. Fluctuations during the 10-50 ns period did not affect the overall geometry of the complex, which converged to a mean energy of interaction of 92.4 \u00b1 5.8 kJ.mol\u22121 as determined from triplicate MD simulations (Table S1). Schematically, the binding site is formed by two discontinuous regions of the protein, including the QFN triad with additional C-136, D-138, R-158 and S-161 residues (Figure. 4, Figure. 5\n). These seven amino acid residues accounted for almost 90% of the whole energy of interaction (Table S1 and Figure 5).",

These new data confirmed and extended our previous results obtained with isolated gangliosides [10]. Indeed, cholesterol and sphingomyelin appeared to stabilize the typical chalice-shaped GM1 dimer which serves as a landing platform for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 6). Moreover, the histograms of Figure 5 show that all amino acid residues of the spike protein that are involved in ATM binding, including the QFN triad, are also essential for GM1 binding in the lipid raft environment (Table S1 and Figure 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the NTD of the viral glycoprotein may indeed display a common ganglioside/ATM binding site, in agreement with our working hypothesis. Sequence alignments revealed that this common binding site, including the QFN triad, is totally conserved among clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from various geographic origins worldwide (Figure 7\n). It is also conserved in bat RaTG13, which further illustrates the close relationship between this bat coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 strains that are currently circulating around the world. We thus suggest considering this region of the NTD for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies. However, the motif has a different sequence signature in other animal- and human-related SARS coronaviruses (Figure 7), suggesting a recent evolution which may be linked to the higher contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 compared with other human coronaviruses.",

This mechanism of action is illustrated in Figure 8\n. By comparing the models in Figure 8a and 8b, one can see that both ATM and gangliosides bind to the same site of the spike protein, centered on the QFN triad. Thus, in presence of ATM, the virus spike would be unable to reach gangliosides on the host plasma membrane (Figure 8c). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that such a mechanism of action is proposed for explaining the antiviral effect of ATM.",

            "text": "Then we looked at CLQ-OH and its interaction with GM1. We recently published a model describing a complex formed by one GM1 and two CLQ-OH molecules [10]. For the sake of comparison, we applied to this model the same molecular modelling approaches as for ATM (i.e. in presence of surrounding raft lipids). We obtained a stable complex formed by a ganglioside dimer, each monomer being associated with two CLQ-OH molecules (Figure 8d). The stability of this complex is reinforced by a rearrangement of CLQ-OH molecules which, while interacting with the saccharide part of GM1, also interact with each other. Consequently, the surface of the ganglioside is almost completely masked, so that the ganglioside dimer can no longer be recognized by the viral spike (Figure 8c). In presence of both ATM and CLQ-OH, virus-ganglioside interactions are efficiently blocked, preventing any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. The molecular details of this synergistic antiviral effect are worth mentioning. As shown in Figures 5 and 8e and Table S1, the QFN triad of the virus spike protein is predicted to interact with the central region of the ganglioside dimer. If we metaphorically compare the dimer to a butterfly, this region corresponds to the insect's head between the wings. For its part, CLQ-OH binds to the wings (Figure 8d), whereas ATM neutralizes the QFN triad of the virus spike protein (Figure 8f). Indeed, all attempts to obtain a stable raft-spike protein complex aborted when GM1 was covered by CLMQ-OH and when ATM was bound to the spike protein. In the particular case of ATM, these data confirm that the QFN triad is critical for GM1 recognition and that although other residues are involved (Figure 5 and Table S1), the whole binding process is fully controlled by the primary interaction driven by the QFN triad. In agreement with this notion, mutating the QFN triad with alanine residues resulted in aborted ATM binding process at the post-docking steps. Taken together, our molecular modelling studies suggest that CLQ-OH and ATM, when bound to their respective targets, totally mask the complementary surfaces provided by the lipid raft and the virus spike (Figure 8c): CLQ-OH binds to GM1 and covers the wing, ATM binds to the virus spike and prevents any interaction with the center area of the ganglioside dimer. Hence both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host cell membrane.",

Our method included a first round of molecular docking, followed by MD simulations of protein-ligand interactions to assess the robustness of each model [25]. Such computer-assisted simulations are particularly helpful for studying protein-ganglioside interactions since crystallographic approaches are usually limited to the water-soluble saccharide part of the ganglioside, neglecting their membrane embedded ceramide part [31]. Unfortunately, the ceramide moiety of gangliosides has a marked effect on the saccharide part with which it interacts, resulting in significant restriction of its conformational possibilities [32]. Therefore, data obtained with oligosaccharides cannot be systematically transposed to intact gangliosides. Molecular modelling approaches allowed us to get around this difficulty by studying whole gangliosides in membrane-compatible conformations [16,32,33]. The MD simulations performed in the present study were done on gangliosides surrounded by cholesterol and sphingomyelin, which mimic a lipid raft environment.",

However, ACE-2 is in lipid rafts and raft disruption induces a marked decrease of virus infection [15]. Thus, it is likely that the virus interacts with the raft surface through multivalent contacts involving both ACE-2 and gangliosides. The fact that the RBD and the ganglioside-binding domain belong to distinct parts of the trimeric spike is consistent with this notion. Such a complex network of virus-host cell membrane interactions is consistent with previously characterized virus infection strategies. Indeed, the HIV-1 fusion process driven by gp120 and gp41 envelope proteins involves a receptor (CD4), a coreceptor (chiefly CCR5) and glycosphingolipid cofactors [39]. Like SARS-CoV-2, the pentameric capsid protein of SV40, and polyoma viruses display three distinct binding sites for gangliosides, which serve as critical receptors for these non-enveloped viruses in lipid raft domains [40].",

(b) Molecular structure similarity between ATM and the saccharide part of ganglioside GM1. Both structures can adopt a globular shape whose surface is covered with a patchwork of OH (arrows 1 and 2) and CH groups (arrow 3). The volume occupied by ATM and the saccharide part of GM1 can be estimated to 2082 and 2293 \u00c53, respectively. (c) front and above views of the trimeric spike, each spike protein subunit with a distinct surface color (cyan for chain A, yellow for chain B, purple for chain C). Atoms belonging to the ganglioside-binding domain of each subunit are visible underneath the slightly transparent surface. The ganglioside-binding domains, the NTD and the RBD are indicated.",
