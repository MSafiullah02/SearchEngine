Vaccination of mice with either the secreted RSV G glycoprotein or formalin-inactivated alum-precipitated RSV leads to Th2 immune responses characterized by augmented IL-5 and IL-13 expression with greater illness and pathology, decreased viral clearance, and heightened pulmonary eosinophilia with subsequent RSV challenge [1], [2]. Recent data from our group reveal that blocking IL-13 activity inhibits formalin-inactivated RSV-induced immune responses [2], and that IL-13 is sufficient for RSV G glycoprotein-induced eosinophilia after RSV challenge [4]. However, the role of IL-13 in the immune response to primary RSV challenge is not fully described.",

IL-13 is a critical cytokine in allergic responses [6], and the interaction between allergic lung inflammation and RSV infection in causing airway dysfunction is of great importance in clinical medicine [7]. In addition, IL-13 is reported to be responsible for RSV-induced airway hyperresponsiveness [8], [9]. IL-13 has many of the same immunomodulatory properties as IL-4, partly because both cytokines signal through the IL-4 receptor \u03b1-chain [5]. Previously, our group found that IL-4 significantly delayed RSV clearance which was associated with suppression of the development of virus-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes [10], suggesting that IL-13 might have a similar effect. However, IL-13 plays a more critical role in immunity to the gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and the intracellular parasite Leishmania major than IL-4 [11], [12], highlighting divergent phenotypic effects of these cytokines in in vivo models of infection.",

In these experiments, we studied RSV infection in mice that overexpressed IL-13 (IL-13 OE) in airway epithelium [13] and in mice in which the IL-13 gene was deleted (IL-13 KO) [14], both from a C57BL/6 background. We also examined the role of IL-13 in RSV immunity by administering a soluble IL-13 receptor (sIL-13Ra) to RSV-infected STAT1 knock-out (STAT1 KO) mice of a BALB/c background. RSV infection in STAT1 KO mice of the BALB/c background elicits a mixed Th2/Th1 response with high levels of IL-13, while wild type BALB/c mice have a predominant Th1 immune response to RSV infection with high levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and extremely low or undetectable levels of IL-13 [15]. Comparison of the immune response of these three different models of RSV infection reveals that elevation of IL-13 levels in IL-13 OE mice results in decreased peak viral titers and protects against illness while decreasing lung IFN-\u03b3 levels. In contrast, RSV infection in IL-13 KO mice or in STAT1 KO mice in which the sIL-13Ra was administered results in higher peak viral tiers, delayed clearance, and augmented IFN-\u03b3 production in the lung.",

The IL-13 OE mice used in the experiments were heterozygous for the IL-13 OE transgene and non-transgenic littermates (IL-13 NT) were used as controls. Both the IL-13 OE and IL-13 NT were maintained on water until transgene activation was desired; at that time, doxycycline (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the animal's drinking water and sucrose (2%) was also added to mask the bitter taste of doxycycline [13]. After four days of treatment with doxycycline, the average IL-13 level was 357 \u00b1 26 pg/ml in the ground lung homogenates of four IL-13 OE mice, while the average IL-13 level was 151 \u00b1 13 pg/ml in four IL-13 OE mice treated with the vehicle. The IL-13 levels were undetectable in ground lung supernatants of the IL-13 NT, whether or not they were treated with doxycycline. Therefore, given that IL-13 OE produced some IL-13 when they were not treated with doxycycline, both the IL-13 OE and IL-13 NT mice were treated with doxycycline to avoid the confounding effect of doxycycline treatment in some groups and not in others.",

As the STAT1 KO-RSV sIL-13Ra mice had greater viral titers than the STAT1 KO-RSV IgGc group, we decided to measure lung levels of IFN-\u03b3 in these two groups (Fig. 7B). On day 6, the STAT1 KO-RSV sIL-13Ra mice had a 160% increase in lung IFN-\u03b3 levels than the STAT1 KO-RSV IgGc (5894 \u00b1 1797 vs. 3512 \u00b1 1672 pg/ml; p\n = 0.39), although this difference was not statistically significant.

Inducible overexpression of IL-13 prior to RSV infection decreased viral titers, diminished lung IFN-\u03b3 production, and protected against RSV-induced weight loss. In contrast, mice which express no IL-13 have higher viral titers and increased IFN-\u03b3 production, while there is no effect of RSV-induced weight loss. Furthermore, administration of a sIL-13Ra to STAT1 KO mice that express IL-13 with primary RSV challenge leads to increased viral titers, prolonged IFN-\u03b3 expression and greater RSV-induced weight loss. In these experiments, we therefore found that IL-13 was inversely related to viral titers. Diminished viral antigen load probably abrogated the need for a strong adaptive immune response with resultant decreased IFN-\u03b3 production in the lung. The absence of IL-13 increased viral load by a yet unknown mechanism, resulting in a greater requirement for adaptive immunity to clear virus, hence the increase in lung IFN-\u03b3 levels. These results suggest that IL-13 modulates the immune response to RSV infection.",

In vitro studies reveal varying effects of IL-13 on anti-viral immunity depending on the virus studied. Primary blood-derived human macrophages that are exposed to IL-13 decrease the infection and replication of HIV-1 [20]. IL-13 blocks the completion of reverse transcription, thus decreasing virus production, and diminishes the infectivity of the progeny virus [21]. In addition, IL-13 induced a 50% reduction in the number of the CD4 and CCR5 binding sites and completely inhibited surface expression of CXCR4 [22]. CD4 is the HIV receptor, while CCR5 and CXCR4 are co-receptors [22]; these are not known to be receptors for RSV. IL-13 also protects bronchoalveolar macrophages from productive infection with HIV-1 [23]. While HIV-1 production is strongly inhibited in alveolar macrophages treated with IL-13, IL-13 treatment increases human cytomegalovirus expression in these same cells [24].",

This stems from the fact that the IL-4R\u03b1 chain is shared by the receptors for both IL-4 and IL-13 [28], and both trigger the STAT-6 signaling pathway. However, T cells do not express IL-13 receptors [29], and effects mediated directly by the cytokines on T cell effectors may differ. Studies of tumor surveillance suggest that IL-13 may alter CD8 + T cell function through an intermediate CD1d-restricted cell type [30]. CD8+ cytolytic function was also increased when IL-13 was inhibited in the setting of recombinant vaccinia infection, but virus titers and illness were not reported [31]. IL-4 has been shown to increase the virulence of poxvirus infection and is associated with a reduction in CTL precursor frequency [32]. IL-4 has also been shown to influence the CTL response to RSV. Overexpression of IL-4 during RSV infection results in delayed virus clearance and enhanced illness, and is associated with abrogated CD8+ cytolytic T cell activity [10]. The effect on CD8 + T cell function in this setting is related to altered cytolytic function, and does not alter frequency or IFN-\u03b3 production in CD8 + T cells [33], [34]. Our current study clearly shows that IL-13 serves a protective role during RSV infection, and does not alter the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD8 + T cells. While RSV-specific cytolytic activity was not measured, the rapid virus clearance (Fig. 2A) suggests that CD8 + T cell function was intact. The differences in the effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on the biological function of CD8+ CTL and the consequent impact on virus pathogenesis is likely due to the difference in the specific receptor distribution and the different pattern of cells with STAT-6 activation.",

While constitutive expression of the IL-13 transgene in IL-13 OE mice increased surfactant proteins (SP)-A, -B, and -C two-fold, and SP-D was increased 70-fold over levels found in non-transgenic littermates [19], we found no difference in these surfactant proteins between IL-13 OE mice in which the transgene was induced two days prior to RSV infection and IL-13 NT mice. This is relevant to our model because SP-A and SP-D are collectins that both enhance pulmonary clearance of RSV [35], [36]. We also found that deficiency of IL-13 did alter either SP-A or SP-D levels in BAL fluid; therefore, surfactant regulation of RSV replication does not seem to be the explanation for the IL-13 regulatory effect on RSV-induced immune responses.",

            "text": "Other possible mechanisms by which IL-13 may modulate RSV pathogenesis include IL-13 regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and/or cathepsin. MMP-9 lung expression is induced in IL-13 OE mice [37]. MMP-9 enhanced syncytial formation leading to RSV multiplication and spread, and these effects were blunted by MMP inhibitors [38]. Therefore, this would suggest that IL-13 induces MMP-9 which in turn would increase viral titers. However, in our study, we found that IL-13 overexpression reduced viral titers and IL-13 deficiency increased viral titers, thus it is not clear how the interaction of IL-13 regulation of MMP-9 might be playing a role in viral replication in our in vivo studies. IL-13 also induced expression of cathepsins [39] which are a major factor in endosomal and lysosomal system proteases and are critical in intracellular antigen processing and presentation [40]. Cathepsins have been shown to be essential for murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 2 spike-mediated entry [41] and also enhanced entry mediated by the Ebola virus glycoprotein [42]. However, the role of cathepsins in RSV entry or pathogenesis has not been described.",
