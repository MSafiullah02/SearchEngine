In addition to the physical, and chemical hazards in the workplace, these workers face high psychological stress associated with low control and job insecurity [1,2,4]. Considering the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, hotel workers, particularly housekeepers are at heightened risk for poor outcomes due to job insecurity and risk of exposure. These risks are amplified because of the current conversation about using hotels as quarantine spaces for those exposed to COVID-19. Though this approach (of providing quarantine spaces) may be warranted, employers are behooved to consider the health and safety of their employees, particularly the housekeepers, during this pandemic.",
