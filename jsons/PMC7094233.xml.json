            "text": "Bioaerosols are airborne biological particulate matter (G\u03ccrny, Dutkiewicz & Krysinska-Traczyk, 1999). The diameter of bioaerosols ranges from 0.3 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm (Cox & Wathes, 1995), and in particular breathable bioaerosols (size range from 1 to 10 \u03bcm) are of primary concern (Heyder, Gebhart, Rudolf, Schiller & Stahlhofen, 1986). Bioaerosols are readily transported through the air and can remain in air environments because of their small size and light weight (Beggs (2003), Hinds, 1982). Bioaerosols, which can be inhaled or attached to human bodies in their airborne state, have been known to be etiological agents for respiratory and infectious human diseases (Cockcroft, Ruffin, Dolovich, & Hargreave (1977), Fiegel, Clarke, & Edwards (2006), Fung & Hughson (2003), Lacey & Crook (1988)). Several studies that have measured concentrations of bioaerosols in indoor and outdoor environments have shown that bioaerosols can significantly affect human health conditions (Ren, Jankun, & Leaderer (1999), Zhu et al. (2003)). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and control bioaerosols in the air for occupational safety and public health purposes (Hwang et al. (2015), Lee et al. (2012), Mainelis et al. (2002), Nazaroff (2014)).",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that the activities of indoor occupants, such as walking, affect the concentration of ordinary aerosol particles (Batterman (2001), Ferro, Kopperud, & Hildemann (2004), He, Morawska, Hitchins, & Gilbert (2004), Raunemaa, Kulmala, Saari, Olin, & Kulmala (1989), Qian, Peccia, & Ferro (2014)). In particular, some studies have found that the activities of occupants increase the concentrations of coarser (aerosol diameter >1 \u03bcm) aerosol particulate matter (Batterman (2001), Raunemaa, Kulmala, Saari, Olin, & Kulmala (1989)) in indoor environments. Based on those works, in this study, we propose that human activity and human presence may affect the concentration of biological particles, as they do for ordinary aerosol particles. There have been a few previous studies on the correlation between human activities and bioaerosol concentrations in indoor air environments. It was found that human occupancy increased the bacterial genome concentration in indoor air environments such as in a classroom (Hospodsky et al. (2012), Qian, Hospodsky, Yamamoto, Nazaroff, & Peccia (2012)). One study found that residential activities had a noticeable effect on the concentrations of culturable fungal bioaerosols in indoor environments (Chen & Hildemann, 2009). It was suggested that human activities caused the resuspension of settled fungal particles into an airborne state (Buttner & Stetzenbach, 1993). The outdoor air flow, rather than human activities, was proposed to be the dominant factor responsible for the level of fungal bioaerosols in indoor air environments (Adams, Miletto, Taylor & Bruns, 2013).",

The data show that all of the measured concentrations of bioaerosols in the test space were below the bioaerosol standard concentration established by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea for health care facilities (800 CFU/m3). The relationship in Fig. 1 shows that an increase in the number of people in the student hall results in increased concentrations of bacterial aerosols (y=1.62x+40.9, r\n2=0.9764, t-test p-value<0.01). However, concentrations of fungal aerosols were not influenced by the number of occupants inside the test space (y=0.37x+42.8, r\n2=0.78). The concentrations of fungal bioaerosols did not vary significantly regardless of the number of human occupants in the student hall (t-test p-value>0.05). Therefore, the experimental data in Fig. 1 support the hypotheses that humans increase the concentration of bacterial bioaerosols in indoor environments but that concentrations of fungal bioaerosols are not affected by the presence of humans. This result is in harmony with a previous study of underground subway stations (Heo & Lee, 2016). For fungal bioaerosols, this result agrees with previous findings that occupants were not a significant factor for fungal bioaerosols (Adams et al., 2013).",

This result agrees with the finding of a previous study in which the genomic analysis of bacteria revealed that elevated concentrations of genomes of bacterial bioaerosols were due to human occupancy (Hospodsky et al., 2012). In addition, one human presence inside the chamber increased the concentration of ordinary aerosol particles. As shown in Fig. 4, concentrations of large particles (optical particle diameter: dp>3 \u03bcm) in the standing condition were 1.2\u20133.5 times higher than those under the vacant condition. The results correspond to findings by Brauer, Hirtle, Lang, and Ott (2000) and Ferro et al. (2004), who measured ordinary particle concentrations with people present. The concentration ratios between the human standing and vacant conditions increased with increasing particle sizes in the current experiment. Furthermore, the correlation analysis between the concentration of large particles (optical particle diameter: dp>3 \u03bcm) and the concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols showed a positive relationship with statistical significance (t-test p-value<0.05). These analyses demonstrate that the investigated bacterial bioaerosols may form aggregates with large aerosol particles. Such conglomerations of aerosol particles with bacterial bioaerosols can provoke noxious respiratory effects as a result of synergistic toxic reactions with viable and inorganic compounds. The possibility of a combination of bacterial bioaerosols and ordinary large particles (optical particle diameter: dp>3 \u03bcm) can be studied in future work to elucidate the relationship between bioaerosols and humans.",

The variation of the bioaerosols concentration is statistically significant (t-test p-value<0.05). This result appears to be contradicted with the results of previous studies of bacterial bioaerosols in human breath (Edwards et al. (2004), Fabian et al. (2008), Qian, Hospodsky, Yamamoto, Nazaroff, & Peccia (2012)). Therefore, we designed and conducted additional experiments to elucidate this experimental result. We measured bioaerosols in inhalation and exhalation air flows in humans and compared the concentrations between both cases. We sampled bioaerosols from the breathing air flows of six volunteers, including the authors, while talking.\nFig. 5 shows the ratio of concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols in exhaled air flow to those of the inhaled air flow, with the following parameter (\u03b7) :(1)\u03b7=BactetialaerosolsinexhaledbreathingairBactetialaerosolsininhaledair.\n",

The concentrations of exhaled breath bacterial bioaerosols were 13% to 75% of the concentrations of inhaled bacterial bioaerosols. Therefore, a maximum of 87% of bacterial bioaerosols were removed from the air during the talking activity. This result demonstrates that strong mouth breathing by humans can decrease the concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols in surrounding air environments. A decrease in concentrations of ordinary aerosol concentrations after the talking activity can also be observed inside the chamber. For large aerosol particles (optical particle diameter: dp>3 \u03bcm), concentrations decreased 20% to 50% after switching from the standing to the talking activities inside the test chamber. The decrease was statistically significant (t-test p-value<0.05). As shown in Fig. 4, for the largest tested particles (optical particle diameter: dp>10 \u03bcm), half of the particles were removed from the air by human mouth breathing. There are several hypotheses that may explain this phenomenon. Human respiratory systems, including oral parts, larynx, and the trachea, may capture a portion of bacterial bioaerosols and ordinary particles, thereby decreasing their concentrations. In addition, talking activity may increase moisture in the surrounding air, which may attach to and increase the diameter of hygroscopic aerosol particles, increasing the high gravitational sedimentation rate.",

The variation of conditions in the test chamber (vacant, standing, talking, and moving) did not affect the concentration of fungal bioaerosols. Under all conditions, including outdoor conditions, the concentration of fungal bioaerosols was approximately 300 CFU/m3 without significant variations (t-test p-value>0.05). This result differs from one previous result of a study involving a classroom experiment with the genomic analysis of fungal bioaerosols (Qian et al., 2012) in which more fungal genomic particles were detected when the classroom was occupied than when the classroom was vacant. However, in that previous study, the difference in bacterial genomic particles between the occupied condition and vacant condition was much larger than the difference in fungal particles between the occupied condition and vacant condition. Therefore, it can be concluded that in the previous study, the bacterial particles were more influenced by human presence than the fungal particles (Qian et al., 2012). This issue regarding the difference between culturability and genomic data on bioaerosols remains to be addressed in future studies.",

            "text": "In summary, Fig. 1, Fig. 2 clearly show that humans affected the concentration of bacterial bioaerosols. Generally, the presence of humans and moving activities increased the concentration of bacterial bioaerosols. However, talking activities decreased the concentration of bacterial bioaerosols in the test chamber, as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 5. The reduction of bacterial bioaerosols during strong respiratory activity is suspected as an explanation of this phenomenon. Under all conditions, culturable fungal bioaerosols showed robust concentrations. Overall, this experimental result demonstrates that bacterial bioaerosols are highly connected with human activities and the source of bacterial bioaerosols may be strongly linked with humans. However, the result for fungal bioaerosols suggests that sources of fungal bioaerosols are not connected with humans. The elucidation of the detailed mechanisms of these findings can be future work. An example of possible explanation is that bacterial particles on human skin particles may contribute to the relationship between human presence and bacterial bioaerosols (Hospodsky et al., 2012). There are several limitations in this study. All experiments were conducted in Seoul, Republic of Korea, with a focus on the culturability of bioaerosols. In this study, it was not covered to sample various areas and detect non-culturable bioaerosols. Although there were at least three replications for all tested conditions, this study covered only a limited number of experimental variables, such as three activities (standing, talking, and moving).",
