The number of active COVID-19 cases worldwide is >1.69 million as of April 12, 2020.1 With rapidly increasing new cases, healthcare systems are at the brink of collapse in some regions. To reduce the burden on health systems, public health strategies should be adopted to control the source of infection, to cut off transmission routes, and to protect vulnerable populations. One strategy that was effective in China in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic was the successful implementation of a nationwide, community-based, dynamic quarantine strategy.2 From Late January to March 18, 2020, the main purpose was to prevent COVID-19 from spreading in China. Afterward, the focus turned to the prevention of imported cases.",

When necessary, they were required to use an electronic pass system with traceable personal information to gain entry to residential areas, work places, and public transportation, and body temperature was screened by thermal scanning at the entrances.3 Once new cases were identified, health professionals and volunteers followed-up, treated, and isolated the patient and those in close contact. From prior experience with SARS, most Chinese citizens understood the importance of the quarantine and were invested in its success. As the epidemic came under better control, community-level management was strengthened and upgraded. It also became more dynamic, allowing movement and return to work to minimize the effects on people\u2019s lives and businesses while still monitoring movements and health status.4\n",

First, the quarantine strategy was strictly implemented nationwide at a community level.5 Strong governmental support is required to strengthen the community, and training is needed to foster policy implementation. Second, the quarantine strategy was dynamic and was adjustable based on the evolving situations, from stay-home quarantine to movement with updated health monitoring. Third, a large team of professional and technical support traced, identified, treated, and isolated patients and their close contacts. These strategies ensured early diagnosis and treatment, thus bringing the COVID-19 pandemic under control in China.",
