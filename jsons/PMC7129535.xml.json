            "text": "In December 2019, Wuhan city (the capital city of Hubei province, China) experienced a major outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus. This outbreak was found to be caused by a novel virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1, 2, 3 Numerous clinical SARS-Co-2 cases have been reported and were distributed among more than half of the countries of the world during a less than 6-month period (data till March 28, 2020).4, 5, 6, 7 The lower respiratory tract is the primary target of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is noteworthy that adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often present with a profound decrease in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets at the early stage of this disease.1\n,\n8 Subsequently, patients suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome for about 7\u201310 days after the onset of COVID-19 due to rapid viral replication, a stormy increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokine response, and inflammatory cell infiltrates.8\n,\n9 Nevertheless, contrary to the SARS cases in 2003,10 some SARS-CoV-2 infection patients did not have the prodromal symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (e.g., cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea), viremia-associated laboratory abnormalities (e.g., leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, elevation of liver enzymes and lactic dehydrogenase), or initial evidence of diagnostic chest roentgenographic abnormalities.6\n,\n11 In addition, uncertain seasonality and the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection oscillating between 2 and 14 days make it remarkably difficult to achieve early diagnosis and initiate treatment on time.5\n,\n9 Previous studies demonstrated that human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is able to use angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor in humans.5\n,\n12 Although children are considered to be significantly less susceptible to HCoV-NL63 infection and have milder disease severity than adults,1\n,\n5\n,\n8\n,\n13 the SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a public health menace to people around the world presently because of high transmission potential and unpredictability of disease progression.14 In order to contain SARS-CoV-2 spread among community residents, stringent infection control measures were implemented by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention of Taiwan since February, 2020. According to an investigation by To et al. (2020),15 patients with SARS-CoV infection had the highest viral load (measured from posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples) close to when they presented. To et al. concluded that since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admissions, early use of potent antiviral agents might be beneficial in controlling COVID-19 severity.15 However, standard treatment against COVID-19 is presently lacking. Herein, the roles of several drugs including antiviral agents, some antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents have been reviewed to explore their efficacy in combating the SARS-CoV-2 (data until March 28, 2020).",

Unlike other nucleotide analogues, remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug with broad-spectrum activity against many virus families, including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae (such as pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]).18\n,\n19\n",

Additionally, data on the safety of remdesivir in humans are available online.21 The first COVID-19 patient in the USA was successfully treated with remdesivir for the progression of pneumonia on day 7 of hospitalization in January, 2020.4 Phase 3 human trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04292899 and NCT04292730, for severe and moderate adult SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively) have been initiated to evaluate its efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection since March, 2020.

They observed the efficacy of remdesivir was superior to that of LPV/RTV-IFNb against MERS-CoV in terms of viral load reduction and improvement in extent of pathologic change in lung tissue.31 In addition to gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) induced by LPV/RTV, it is noteworthy that LPV/RTV treatment alone (400/100 mg administered orally twice daily for 14 days; Chinese Clinical Trial Register number, ChiCTR2000029308) failed to provide benefits compared to standard care alone.

Shen et al. (2020) reported on five critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific antibody (binding titer >1:1000 and neutralization titer >40). The convalescent plasma was obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and it was administered to the five enrolled patients between 10 and 22 days after admission. Antiviral agents and methylprednisolone were also administered. Following plasma transfusions, improvements in clinical condition were observed, including normalization of body temperature within 3 days (in 4/5 patients), decrease in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, rise in PaO2/FiO2, resolution of ARDS (4 patients at 12 days after transfusion), a success of weaning from mechanical ventilation (3 patients within 2 weeks of treatment), and decline in viral loads (became negative within 12 days) and increase in SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers. Of the 5 patients, 3 were discharged from the hospital (lengths of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), while 2 were in stable condition at 37 days after transfusions.56 The authors concluded that use of convalescent plasma transfusion is beneficial among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, even though the sample number in this study is small.56\n",

There is presently no vaccine or documented specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug regimen to treat critically ill patients. Most of the potential drugs for treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated for safety and efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is the most promising agent. In addition, favipiravir and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin appear to be acceptable alternatives for treatment of COVID-19 patients. For patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE inhibitor and ARB need to be prescribed with caution. Compared with NSAIDs, acetaminophen might be a safer agent for treating fever in COVID-19 patients. Finally, low-dose steroid (hydrocortisone) might be prescribed for treatment of refractory shock in patients with COVID-19.",
