Due to concerns about high bacterial load, further processing steps were incorporated, initially composting, which aimed to reduce bacterial numbers by raising the temperature (Carroll and Jasper, 1978). Later, it became popular to use as bedding solid material extracted from the products of the anaerobic digestion of manure as a way of offsetting the cost of digesters (Timms, 2008b). Many combinations of separation, digestion and composting are now practised in the USA, allowing successful use of RMS bedding in cooler, wetter regions of the US (Timms, 2008a, Timms, 2008b, Timms, 2008c).",

Livestock manures are Category 2 Animal By-products, as defined by EC Regulation 1069/2009. As such, their use as a \u2018technical product\u2019 (e.g. animal bedding) is only permitted if strict conditions apply which minimise the health risks involved. \u2018Safe end use\u2019 of a product derived from animal by-products is defined as use \u2018under conditions which pose no unacceptable risks to public and animal health\u2019 (EC Regulation 1069/2009). Member State jurisdictions are approaching this requirement in different ways. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Scottish Office have allowed the use of this bedding under controlled conditions, while research is carried out, while in Wales and Northern Ireland the practice is currently (May 2015) prohibited.",

From a survey of 297 dairies, Lombard et al. (2010) reported a higher prevalence of severe hock lesions in cows bedded on dry or composted RMS compared with sand, straw and sawdust. The main advantage may be that farmers are willing to use more generous amounts of RMS (Leach et al., 2014); deeper layers of bedding have been associated with lower prevalence of hock (Brenninkmeyer et al., 2013) and claw lesions (Barker et al., 2009).",

A telephone survey of 38 farmers in the upper mid-west States indicated that those using digested manure solids were able to keep bmSCC consistently below 250,000 cells/mL, while for those using separated solids bmSCC exceeded 450,000 cells/mL (Endres, 2008). On 34 farms, (9 using raw solids, 21 digestate, and 4 composted material), average bmSCC was 274,000 cells/mL (\u00b1SD 98.000 cells/mL) (Husfeldt and Endres, 2012). When Harrison et al. (2008) followed the bmSCC patterns of nine farms that converted to RMS (including fresh, composted and digested), some increased and some decreased after conversion. An attempt was made to compare the change in bmSCC over a 7 year period on these farms with the whole state population; this unpublished analysis indicated that a linear score for bmSCC increased more rapidly on the RMS farms than in the whole state population, but, since the bedding types in the whole state were not known, the authors were reluctant to draw conclusions.",

(2008) tested 15\u201336 samples of unused RMS bedding from each of nine types of bedding from six farms \u2013 including composted and digested materials. Both composting (Bonhotal et al., 2011) and anaerobic digestion (Timms, 2008b, Pronto, Gooch, 2009) significantly reduced MAP levels. However, on at least one occasion, MAP was found in all but one of the materials, albeit at low levels, indicating that neither composting nor digestion can guarantee elimination of this pathogen. The highest prevalence was positive results from 12/24 samples of freshly separated material from one farm, with a mean load of 174 cfu/g. For this reason, and because of the high risk of MAP transmission in early life, it is recommended that RMS is not used to bed any areas where cows are kept for the late dry period or calving, or housing for calves or young stock.",

However, there is little or no information on the influence that such a \u2018closed cycle\u2019 will have, either on the virulence of pathogens or (of particular current concern) on the genetic material conveying antimicrobial resistance. One US study of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella spp. found that those dairy herds with at least one resistant strain of Salmonella isolated from faeces were more likely to be using composted or dried manure as bedding than those with no resistant strains (Habing et al., 2012).",

On average, freshly separated manure solids did not show elevated levels of these spores, but all composted materials (which in this trial did not include composted RMS) did. The elevated levels in composted bedding were translated to farm bulk milk, with spore concentrations of the mesophilic group being six times higher and the thermophilic group being 100 times higher in milk from farms using composted materials. Although composted RMS was not included in that trial, the implication is that similar patterns would be likely for this material also.

In general, bacterial levels are considerably reduced and coliforms often undetectable by culture after digestion (Meyer et al, 2007, Tulloch et al, 2009). However, the temperature in the digester is critical; mesophilic digesters running at temperatures of 30 \u00b0C\u201338 \u00b0C can increase bacterial numbers (J. Tulloch, personal communication). With mesophilic anaerobic digestion of beef cattle slurry, the time taken for E. coli, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica to reduce by 90% (T90) ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 days during batch digestion and from 1.1 to 2.5 days during semi-continuous digestion. Listeria monocytogenes took longer to reduce (T90 = 37 days during semi-continuous digestion and 12 days with batch digestion). Anaerobic digestion had little effect on viable numbers of Campylobacter jejuni (Kearney et al., 1993).

Effects are usually short-lived, in the range of 24\u201348 h (Hippen et al., 2007). Hogan et al. (1999) included RMS as a substrate in an experiment testing the effect of \u2018bedding conditioners\u2019 on bacterial load. Specifically for \u2018raw\u2019 RMS, these authors reported that, although both acid and alkali conditioners reduced bacterial populations in unused material, only the alkali conditioner and hydrated lime inhibited bacteria in used bedding, and only for 1 day; use of an acid conditioner had little effect on bacteria in bedding. Sharkey et al. (2011) reported a more rapid and greater decline in Klebsiella counts in composted RMS stored in a pile, as a result of application of a proprietary conditioner (SOP-C COW), but there was no effect on streptococci. Feiken and van Laarhoven (2012) added lime and a proprietary alkali to RMS cubicles but found that the resulting pH change was insufficient to reduce most bacteria effectively, although there was a significant reduction in B. cereus with the proprietary conditioner.",

UK farmers also perceive benefits for cow comfort and cleanliness, likely to be dependent on the previous bedding material used for comparison. The literature gives less evidence for the scale of absolute welfare benefits but there are definitely advantages of comfort compared with abrasive materials on mattresses. There are challenges and risks associated with the practice, not least in view of the dearth of information on many of the long term implications. Anecdotal reports of difficulties of maintaining udder health on RMS exist, but no large scale, long term studies of effects on clinical and subclinical mastitis have been published; nor is there any information on clinical implications for other diseases. Very little is known about the influence of maintaining the material in a \u2018closed cycle\u2019, the effects of its use on pathogen virulence and antimicrobial resistance, or the risk of airborne pathogens arising from it. Should farmers choose to adopt RMS bedding, they are advised to do so with caution, apply the required strategies for risk mitigation, maintain strict hygiene of bed management and milking practices and monitor the effects on herd health closely.",
