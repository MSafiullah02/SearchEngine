            "text": "Rangelands occupy some 30\u201350% of the earth\u2019s land area (World Resources Institute, 2000, Houghton et al., 2001), and they supply more than 80% of the feed of the livestock in Asia and Africa, about 25% in north and central America and some 50% in the rest of the world (Allen-Diaz et al., 1996). Thus rangelands are of vital importance for the production of live stock. Also for the global climate, rangelands have a strong impact. For example, they store 405\u2013806 Gt of carbon (World Resources Institute, 2000) and absorb about 0.5 PgC per year (Scurlock and Hall, 1998). Given their large extent and importance, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the natural environments of the rangelands, in general, and of the mechanisms that maintain or change the ecosystem in response to the environmental changes in particular. Since many of the rangelands are located in areas classified as arid- or semi-arid, the presence or lack of water is one of the key variables determining the fate of their ecosystem, and thus the understanding of the hydrologic processes is critically important. In addition, since water generally is brought into rangelands as precipitation, the atmospheric circulation is also a factor that should be understood. Moreover, changes of the ecosystem will eventually influence the atmospheric circulation and hydrologic cycle. This means that the ecosystem, the hydrologic cycle, and the atmosphere cannot be studied separately, but that their mutual interactions and feedbacks must also be considered.",

Many of these studies have been very useful to understand several of the more important process occurring in rangelands. However, a full understanding of the complex nature of the rangeland environment and of the various interactions and feedbacks between the different processes are still lacking. Also, one should note that the rangelands in northeastern Asia have not received attention they deserve in contrast to some of the others. There are general features that are common to any rangeland, but at the same time there exist local characteristics which are relevant only in certain specific situations. Both types of characteristics must be studied, and it is only through comparison and integration of the results obtained in geographically diverse rangelands that a sufficient understanding of rangelands can be achieved.",

As a consequence of the steep, meridional gradient in climate, a distinct ecotone of forest-steppe-desert is formed in this part of the world (Fig. 1\n). An ecotone in general is sensitive and susceptible to environmental changes (e.g., Pogue and Schnell, 2001) such as global warming even when the extent of the change is small. For example, in the interface region between the forest and the steppe in Mongolia, one can often observe the presence of a forest and a grassland located side by side. Forest is usually formed on the slopes facing north, while grasses can be found on the slopes facing south. This difference of vegetation cover within a small area appears to have been maintained by the slight difference in surface hydrology, evaporation and soil moisture in particular, and in meteorology in connection with the vegetation types that produce differences in surface aridity (Yamazaki et al., 2004). Such small differences can easily be disturbed once the forest is destroyed by, e.g., human activities or forest fire. When that happens, it is not easy to recover the forest. In fact, it has been reported that winter and spring air temperatures have increased in this region (Yatagai and Yasunari, 1994) while the summer total precipitation appears to have increased, with also increased frequency of heavier rainfall in eastern and western Mongolia over the last four decades (Endo et al., 2006). It is possible that such climatic changes may have induced or will induce drastic changes in plant growth and vegetation distribution directly or indirectly through changes in hydrological cycle. However, this is merely a speculation and solid information or knowledge to support this scenario is not available yet for this region.",

This selection was based on three major considerations. First, the watershed is part of the ecotone formed in this region and it displays a clear gradient in vegetation from forest in the north to steppe in the south. This allows an investigation of vegetation effects within the same watershed. The second consideration was that only small villages or cities exist within the catchment, and thus there is no need to be concerned with urbanization, which is not yet a major problem in Mongolia except for its capital city Ulaanbaatar (UB) and some larger cities. The third reason for the selection was that within this watershed, a relatively dense network of meteorological, hydrological and biology stations has been operated (see Fig. 5) by the Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (IMH) of Mongolia, and the data prior to RAISE can be utilized to study inter-annual variations and to verify the model outputs.",

This corresponds well with the precipitation distribution in the watershed (Fig. 4), and partly with topography (Fig. 5). In this region, the amount of precipitation, not temperature, is the major factor that determines the dominant vegetation cover (Sugita, 2003). Annual mean temperature is around \u00b12 \u00b0C (Table 1).

Their stations consist of the Meteostation, the Meteopost station, the Gauging station and the Biostation (IMH, 1995, IMH, 1998, IMH, 2000, IMH, 2002). The Meteostation and the Meteopost measure the standard meteorological elements including air temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and precipitation. However, the Meteostation measures more variables with, in general, higher accuracy, and at finer time intervals of eight times a day from zero Mongolian Standard Time (MST) than the Meteopost stations which report measurements four times a day at 2, 8, 14, 20 MST, respectively. At the Gauging station placed along major rivers, the water level is measured twice daily while the water velocity and the cross-sectional area to derive discharge are measured five times a month. The Biostation measures such variables as plant species, phenology and biomass. Some of these different types of stations are collocated.",

One flux station (to be referred to hereafter as station FOR) was established in a mildly hilly area (see Fig. 6\n) some 25 km northeast of Mongenmoryt (MNG) village in the upper river basin (Li et al., 2005a) while two others were set up within an extensive steppe area in Kherlenbayan-Ulaan village (KBU) (see Fig. 7\n). Fig. 8, Fig. 9\nillustrate the long-term variations of precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at MNG and KBU, respectively. At KBU, one station called A1 was located within the natural, pastoral steppe, while another essentially identical station called A2 was placed within a 200 m by 170 m fenced area to prevent grazing to take place since September of 2002 (Fig. 7). Station A1 is co-located with one of the IMH meteoposts. The instrumentations of these three stations are listed in Tables 2\u20134 (see the supplementary materials, in Appendix). Note that soil heat flux G was initially measured at A1 and A2 sites with a soil heat flux plate only at single location, and thus they may not have been representative of each area. In the April of 2005, additional 10 soil heat flux plates were buried at each of the stations to address this issue. Note also that mobile observations of the four radiation components of the net radiation Rn around A1 and A2 sites were carried out in 2005, which confirmed that the Rn values measured at each station are representative of those of the pastoral and the protected steppe. A footprint analysis for neutral atmospheric stability (Stannard, 1997) has indicated that 90% of the fluxes measured at these stations originate from upwind distances smaller than 3000 m and 750 m for the FOR and KBU sites, respectively. These distances are well within the extent of each vegetation cover for the dominant wind directions for the FOR site and A1 site at KBU. Although this distance extends beyond the fenced area for the A2 site of KBU, approximately 70% of the source fluxes still originate from within the fenced area. During daytime under unstable stability conditions, these distances should shrink because of the enhanced turbulence activity.",

The TERC-RAMS model was based on the regional atmospheric modeling system (Pielke et al., 1992) but some modifications were made to improve its ability to reproduce the hydrometeorological regime, especially precipitation, in this region. The Sim-CYCLE Grazing model was based on the Sim-CYCLE model of Ito and Oikawa (2002) and a foliation model of Seligman et al. (1992) which allows the evaluation not only of the CO2 fluxes and carbon accumulation within the ecosystem but also of the effect of the grazing activities which would consume the above-ground biomass and impact soil surface conditions, and eventually the below-ground physical condition and biological activities as well. The distributed hydrologic model is based on Lu et al. (1996). Since the thaw and freezing processes are particularly important in this region, they have been incorporated into the model (Doi et al., 2005), together with some refinement of the treatment of various hydrologic processes.",

Although there have been some theories and discussions of this issue, there is still no agreement on the exact reason(s) for the aridity of this region. Sato and Kimura (2005a) have successfully demonstrated through numerical experiments with their TERC-RAMS model that the presence of the Tibetian plateau, which heats the atmosphere and creates the upward convective motion of the air which in turn induces the downward flow in northern part of the plateau, is the main cause of the dryness of this area. Another question is where the origins of the precipitation are located. An isotopic analysis by Yamanaka et al. (2006) gives a partial answer on this issue. They collected rain water through an extensive sampling network in Mongolia, and were able to show that the observed \u03b4 values of the rainfall agree quite well with the predictions of a Rayleigh-type model except for July, for which \u03b4 values are significantly lower than those of the prediction. This tends to suggest that there is a contribution of evaporated water in the rainfall in this region in July. Such evaporated water is likely to come from southeastern China with its widespread rice paddy fields and higher temperatures in summer.",

This has been partially confirmed with our studies. For example, Tsujimura et al. (2006a) indicate from a regression analysis between altitude and \u03b4\n18O in the precipitation that the main stem of the Kherlen river is fed by precipitation fallen in the headwater region above 1650 m asl, where the annual precipitation is larger around 250\u2013300 mm. Water balance considerations of the Kherlen river watershed (Kamimera et al., 2005) tend to support this idea. Note that there was a possibility that the melted water from the permafrost could also be the source of the river water in this region. However, a figure of \u03b4\n18O vs \u03b4D (Tsujimura et al., 2006b) has successfully shown that this is not the case, and that the precipitation is the major source of the river water.",

This is quite in contrast to the traditional view of river flow in arid areas in which river water is supposed to disappear as it flows because of losses due to recharge into the riparian groundwater aquifers and to river surface evaporation. Since the shallow groundwater circulates within a local system, and is replenished only by high intensity precipitation events (Tsujimura et al., 2006b), it is quite important to evaluate the water balance of each shallow local groundwater system to avoid over-exploitation, since it is the main source of water for grazing and daily nomadic life.",

Their study shows that there are differences in soil chemistry and physics that clearly reflect the characteristics and amount of the precipitation and infiltration at each location. The presence of the different soil in turn means that the same environmental impacts or disturbances could result in quite different consequences in soils, even though the general soil class within the experimental area is classified as essentially the same Calcic Kastanozems and Calcic Hyposodic Kastanozems (Asano et al., 2006). Mariko et al. (this issue) studied experimentally the effect of water on the CO2 and CH4 fluxes at the soil surface at KBU. Immediately after an artificial rainfall, CO2 emission from the soil to the atmosphere increased while the CH4 absorption by the soil decreased. It is suspected that the rainfall activated the microorganisms and resulted in changes in the fluxes due to respiration. Thus the soil respiration depends not only the soil temperature but also the soil water content. This is another example of the profound relevance of water in controlling fate of the rangelands in various ways.",

A more thorough knowledge of this difference should allow a better assessment of the possible impact on the environment when, for example, the vegetation changes from forest to grassland. A series of studies (Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005b, Li et al., 2005c, Li et al., 2006a, Li et al., 2006b, Li et al., 2006c, Li et al., 2006d) have shown that there is a distinctive difference in the interaction features between the larch forest in the upper watershed and the steppe grassland, although the general seasonal trend is essentially the same. For example, the magnitude of the latent heat fluxes are larger in the forested area, with an annual evaporation of about 225 mm in the forest at FOR and 163 mm in the grassland at KBU. Another contrasting feature of the forest and the grassland is the source of the evaporative fluxes. A keeling plot analysis with stable isotopes (Tsujimura et al., 2006a) has indicated that 60\u201370% of the total evapotranspiration is the transpiration at FOR while it is only 30\u201360% at KBU. Also at FOR, it was found (Li et al., 2005c) that water used by the larch trees originate from the upper 30-cm surface layer of the soil when the precipitation input was large and the soil moisture was relatively high while it came from the deeper layers when the water supply in the upper soil layer was limited. Soil water itself was found to come mainly from summer precipitation (Li et al., 2006d) at the FOR site located on a hilly terrain. The stable isotope analysis carried out on samples taken along a transect from the FOR site toward the Kherlen river indicated that as the land surface elevation decreases toward the river, the trees indeed begin to use river water.",

            "text": "Another aspect one needs to consider is the variability of the surface fluxes. Although rangelands are relatively homogeneous in comparison with other types of surfaces, they still exhibit heterogeneity resulting from small topographic features, changes in dominant vegetation, etc., with horizontal scales ranging from 100 to 102\n m or more. For example, a preliminary study presented in Sugita et al. (2005) has shown that the instantaneous sensible heat flux H exhibits a horizontal variation of 20\u201350 W/m2 around a mean H of about 100 W/m2 over a distance of several kilometers even under clear sky conditions. Therefore measurements at a given station may not necessarily represent the average conditions of the entire experimental area. This issue was studied by Asanuma (2006) who utilized a large aperture scintillometer which allows evaluation of the sensible heat flux H averaged over a distance of up to 5 km near the A1 station at KBU. His results indicate that fluxes from the A1 station and those from the scintillometer are indeed comparable with each other, and thus a station measurement of the fluxes averaged over appropriate time can probably taken as representative over a steppe region. However, a more detailed analysis has also shown that the choice of empirical formula has a large influence on the uncertainty in H, and further studies are required to reduce the uncertainty associated with this problem.",

Kotani and Sugita (this issue) explored this through the application of variance methods with data observed by the aircraft in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Their results indicate that while a calibration is needed, the variance methods can produce surface fluxes H with an accuracy of the order of 30 W/m2. This accuracy could be further improved by including additional variables describing large scale atmospheric features such advection or baroclinicity. Another approach to evaluate the regional distribution of the surface fluxes makes use of satellite remote sensing in conjunction with a model. This was carried out by Matsushima (this issue) who utilized the GOES9 and MODIS satellite data to estimate the solar radiation, the surface temperature and LAI. These derived products were then put into the surface heat budget model which allowed the estimation of the surface fluxes with an error <30 W/m2 on a daily basis during the growing season. The derived map of evaporation that extends horizontally over a distance of the order of 102\n km indicates that there is a considerable horizontal variation, for example, in the range of 0.5\u20134.0 mm/day on a sunny summer day even though the general class of vegetation is the same grassland.",

First, possible effects on the surface-atmosphere interaction have been evaluated by comparing the vegetation, the surface fluxes and other meteorological and hydrologic variables in a pastoral steppe and in a fenced, protected steppe. The protection of the fenced area from grazing animals started in 2002 as mentioned above and since then three years of data had been collected as of the end of 2005. Thus the results obtained so far (Kato, in preparation, Kato et al., 2005, Urano et al., 2005) are still preliminary in nature, but they already show a remarkable difference between the two sites. Results of field surveys of the vegetation differences between these two sites have been presented by Urano et al. (2005), Li (Unpublished data, 2005) and Hoshino (2006). Even in July of the summer of 2003, merely one fall-winter season after the fence construction, the peak above-ground biomass (AB) and the amount of litter were found to be larger by respectively some 33% and 133% within the fenced area while the below-ground biomass (BB) remained essentially the same(Liu et al., 2005). The maximum and mean height of vegetation were also found higher by 26\u201330% inside the fence. These differences became even larger in the summer of 2004 particularly for the AB. Toward the third year in 2005, major changes were observed in the difference of litter. The litter is usually consumed by grazing during the dormant season since live biomass is not available. This was even more so at KBU where animals as many as around 9.7 \u00d7 104 sheep equivalent unit (SEU), in which the numbers of different animals are translated into sheep equivalent numbers by the ratios given by Asian Development Bank (2002), are brought to this area during winter season due to its milder climate (Mr. Gerelsuren of the KBU village mayor, Personal communication, 2004). From spring through fall, the average animal number is 4.6 \u00d7 104 SEU in this village of 1.982 \u00d7 105 ha. These numbers can be translated into the stocking rate or the grazing pressure of around 0.5\u20131.5 (winter) and 0.5 (spring-fall) SEU/ha when the seasonal difference of the grazing area is taken into consideration. This large stocking rate has clearly contributed to the loss of litter in this pastoral steppe and has resulted in almost twice as much litter accumulation inside the fenced area as on the outside.",

In contrast, Rn showed only a small difference at the two areas. At peak vegetation strength the latent heat and H fluxes were found larger inside the fenced area.

It is generally argued that grazing activities reduce surface vegetation coverage and thus make the soil more vulnerable to erosion. Studies of Onda et al., this issue, Nishikawa et al., 2005 have estimated the runoff generation and the sediment discharge, i.e., the amount of water erosion of soils at two contrasting small experimental watersheds at KBU and BGN in terms of grazing pressure. The overall discharge during the observation period was higher at the BGN than at the KBU watershed for the same size of rainfall. This is somewhat surprising given the sparse vegetation with heavier grazing at the KBU watershed. However, investigation of the sediment discharge over the past 40 years or so by using 137Cs and 210Pbex have shown that indeed the mean soil erosion rate in the past at the KBU has been larger than that at the BGN watershed. This probably means that at KBU, surface soils that can be easily eroded had already been discharged and now there was a smaller soil discharge even though the potential of the erosion was still quite high. Thus not only the current status of the grazing activities but also the past activities are important to investigate the soil erosion and the land degradation of an area. Note that wind erosion in this area has been found to be smaller in a preliminary study of Nishikawa et al. (2005).",

This task has been and will be worked out mainly by three models as mentioned above. Although not all tasks have been completed, some relevant results are reported in this special issue. Sato et al. (2006) have estimated the current and future regional climate, with the main focus on the summer precipitation, of this region by means of the dynamical downscaling method (Houghton et al., 2001) with the GCM outputs and reanalysis data as two means of inputs into a computational model. The target years were 1991\u20132000 for the hindcast and 2071\u20132080 for the prediction based on the A2 scenario (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000) run of a GCM experiment. The comparison between the mean precipitations observed by the IMH stations and those hindcasted by the model indicated that the distribution patters of the precipitation agrees fairly well although the absolute values were found underestimated in the southern and eastern parts, overestimated in the western part, and in agreement in the southern and in mountainous regions. The difference between the current 10-year means and future 11-year means were studied, and it was found that both predictions based on the two inputs produced similar results with a rainfall decrease of 15% in the NW and NE regions, while in the SE and SW regions the changes can be considered negligible. On average over the entire region of Mongolia, the rainfall will appear to decrease. Since major rivers in Mongolia have their origins in the NW and NE regions, the decrease in rainfall could become a serious concern for water resources management.",

            "text": "\nChen et al., 2006a, Chen et al., this issueb studied the sustainable grazing pressure on the grasslands by means of their ecosystem model for a range of stocking rates and for the climatological conditions given as the 10-year averages of the IMH Meteopost at KBU. Their results based on model runs over 250 years at one month time steps demonstrated that, as the grazing pressure increases, the AB, the BB, and the above-ground and below-ground net primary production (ANPP, BNPP) decrease significantly. For example, for an assumed condition without any grazing activities, these values remain about the same. For a stocking rate of 0.4\u20130.7 sheep/ha, the ANPP value initially decreases but eventually reaches an equilibrium. However, for a larger stocking rate, the ANPP decreases all the time and should eventually result in the loss of the grasslands ecosystem. Thus the Mongolian steppe region, represented by KBU, could be classified as \u201covergrazed\u201d for a stocking rate in excess of 0.7 sheep/ha, as \u201cmoderately grazed\u201d for 0.4\u20130.7 sheep/ha, and as \u201clightly grazed\u201d when it is grazed by less than 0.07 sheep/ha. Since current grazing pressures in Mongolia lie in the range of 0.25\u20131.50 sheep/ha (Fig. 12\n), the grazing pressure in some areas is already too extensive, as it exceeds the critical rate of sustainable land use. Moreover, the above statistics represent averages obtained for each soum over a relatively large area. Locally, higher stocking rates have been reported. For example, the stocking rate at KBU is as high as 7 sheep/ha in winter due to the migration of animals to this area as mentioned above. Thus, more specific estimate of such local stocking rates is probably needed to make full use of the model predictions.",

There is still a profound lack of understanding of these processes and their mutual interactions and of information in this area in comparison with other rangelands in the world. Thus the results presented in this special issue and elsewhere from the RAISE projects should contribute to fill this vacuum and should provide the general scientific community with information needed to compare and integrate the results obtained here with those obtained elsewhere. For example, among the papers presented in the special issue on the semi-arid land-surface-atmosphere (SALSA) program (Goodrich et al., 2000) whose observations took place at the semi-arid Mexico-U.S. border region, several can readily be compared with our results to gain insight into the generality and the differences of the processes and features these rangelands. One finding that appears to be general relates to surface-atmosphere interactions. Both projects utilized and have demonstrate potential and the difficulties involved in the use of large aperture scintillometer to infer the area-averaged fluxes. At the same time, one can easily identify subjects that are quite area specific. For example, in the SALSA experimental area, shrub or mesquite invasion of the grassland and its influence on the hydrologic cycle appear to be an important subject, while in the RAISE experimental area, grazing activities are still within the limited range and the grasslands degradation may not yet be of a high priority environmental problem, except for sites with locally high grazing pressure. Nevertheless, a comparison should allow results obtained at a particular area to be put into perspective, and thus should be carried out more extensively with results obtained in areas with diverse climatic, hydrologic and social conditions.",

Within the framework of the RAISE project, it has become clear that the shallow groundwater is recharged and consumed essentially locally, except for the higher elevations of the watershed and for the vicinity of the streams channels. Thus an estimation of the recharge rate and the optimal water withdrawal from each groundwater system based on water balance considerations are essential to allow sustainable use of the shallow groundwater resources. Tsujimura et al. (2004, personal communication) have initiated such a study to estimate the groundwater recharge rate in a small watershed where the surface water does not exit and where the shallow groundwater, which accumulates in the lower part of the watershed, is used for grazing and daily nomadic activities through a hand-dug well. This type of study should be extended to other watersheds to determine the spatial and inter-annual variability of the water balance and the recharge rate.",

Each of them appears to be promising. However, they are still in the research phase, and the utilization of these novel techniques or their products in other research areas or in an operational system is still not ready for full implementation, and their actual usage needs to be explored further. One obvious option would be the usage of these products as inputs or validation data for models of climate, hydrology and ecosystem simulation. The surface-atmosphere interaction processes are a common interface which all models include as a relevant feature. Perhaps through off-line comparison or eventually on-line coupling, new findings and newer approaches of the atmosphere-interaction studies can be fully utilized.",

Naturally further studies are desired to take into account processes that have become evident through observations but are not yet incorporated in the models. An example is the reduction of the C and N inputs into the soil by the prohibition of grazing. Also the combined use of the models for future prediction (Fig. 13\n) is a natural target of the study.",
