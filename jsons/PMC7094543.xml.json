The World Health Organization case definition is as follows: history of high fever (ie, temperature, > 38\u00b0C); one or more respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing; and close contact within 10 days before the onset of symptoms with a person in whom SARS was diagnosed, history of travel within 10 days before the onset of symptoms to an area with reported foci of SARS transmission, or both.11 Patients whose pneumothorax could be attributed to a preexisting pulmonary disease or to an iatrogenic cause (eg, barotrauma or invasive procedures to the chest or neck) were excluded from the study. At PWH, we were aware of four patients who developed pneumothorax secondary to mechanical ventilation (two patients) or central venous cannulation (two patients). As the causes of pneumothorax in these cases were clearly iatrogenic and not spontaneous, these patients were not included in our series.",

He was a radiographer at PWH who had been in close contact with SARS patients for the 3 weeks since the initial outbreak. His chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates at the time of hospital admission. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, methylprednisolone, and convalescent serum was given with initial clinical improvement. On the 32nd day after hospital admission, he was noted to have a sudden increase in dyspnea. Chest radiography confirmed a left pneumothorax with parts of the left lung adherent to the parietal pleura as a result of postinflammatory adhesions (Fig 1\n), creating several loculations of air and fluid within the left pleural space. The pneumothorax was managed with a chest tube. However, despite suction of 10 cm H2O from the chest drain, the chest radiograph showed that the left lung had only partially reexpanded, with several large loculations of air still remaining. A CT scan of the thorax confirmed the presence of loculated air pockets, which were not adequately drained, and showed diffuse, patchy inflammatory changes in both lungs, with a \u201choneycomb\u201d appearance that was similar to that of mild bronchiectasis (Fig 2\n). A pigtail catheter was inserted into the largest loculation under ultrasound guidance. The pigtail catheter then was replaced with another chest tube for better drainage, and both drains were set to suction at 10 cm H2O. Symptomatic relief of the dyspnea was achieved, with improved lung reexpansion seen on chest radiography. An air leak persisted from both drains but eventually resolved with conservative management after 21 days, after which both the drains were successfully removed.",

Her son, a health-care worker with prior contact with SARS patients, had recently received a diagnosis of SARS but had been living with this patient for over a week prior to his own hospital admission. Her chest radiograph on presentation showed mild bilateral focal haziness, and a CT scan of the thorax revealed consolidations in the upper and lower lobes of her right lung. She initially showed a good response to treatment with ribavirin and methylprednisolone, with settling of her fever, but on the 37th day after hospital admission, she had an acute increase in dyspnea. A chest radiograph confirmed a 20% right-sided pneumothorax. Despite her dyspnea, she remained fully conscious and was able to communicate verbally. Immediate chest drainage was offered to the patient, but she strongly refused. In view of the patient's wishes and the family's acceptance of her poor prognosis, it was agreed that invasive management of the pneumothorax would be withheld. Serial chest radiographs showed no further increase in the size of the pneumothorax.

A high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the thorax showed widespread ground-glass opacifications in both lungs. On the 25th day after hospital admission, she developed sudden respiratory distress requiring urgent transfer to the ICU. The chest radiograph taken immediately confirmed a 50% left pneumothorax and a very small right apical pneumothorax. A left chest tube was inserted immediately with good symptomatic relief of her dyspnea. Suction at 10 cm H2O was applied, and subsequent chest radiographs showed complete reexpansion of the left lung and spontaneous resolution of the tiny right apical pneumothorax. She suddenly became more dyspneic again on the 31st day, and a chest radiograph showed a 50% right pneumothorax had recurred. A right chest drain was inserted, and 10 cm H2O of suction was applied. Although the chest radiograph showed good reexpansion of the right lung, she developed progressively severe respiratory failure with ground-glass lung infiltrations seen on her subsequent chest radiographs. She was intubated 2 days later and received mechanical ventilation. This appeared to exacerbate the air leakage from the right lung, with chest radiography showing a recurrent right pneumothorax. A second right chest drain was inserted, and both were set on suction of 20 cm H2O. Chest radiography confirmed complete right lung reexpansion, but her lung infiltrates progressed and she developed refractory hypoxemia. She died with intractable respiratory failure 4 weeks after ICU admission.",

Therapy with ribavirin and steroid yielded a good initial clinical response, but he deteriorated in the second week with a recurrence of high fever, increasing dyspnea, and diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates seen on chest radiographs. On the 17th day after hospital admission, increased dyspnea and mild subcutaneous emphysema in the neck were noted, and the chest radiograph (Fig 4\n) showed a pneumomediastinum and thin rims (< 1 cm) of pneumothoraces bilaterally. He was transferred to the ICU, and a right chest drain was inserted. However, his dyspnea persisted, and he promptly required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. A left chest drain insertion was subsequently performed, and 10 cm H2O suction was applied to both chest drains. A chest radiograph showed the full expansion of both lungs. However, after a few days of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation, increasing subcutaneous emphysema was noted, which is indicative of persistent air leakage. Therefore, one additional chest drain was inserted on each side. The air leaks gradually resolved after 1 month, and all chest drains were removed immediately prior to his weaning from mechanical ventilation.",

Therapy with ribavirin and methylprednisolone was administered, with a good initial clinical response. However, his fever recurred on day 5, followed by both clinical and radiologic deterioration. Seventeen days after hospital admission, his condition acutely deteriorated further with worsening dyspnea. Chest radiography showed bilateral lower zone ground-glass infiltrates with patchy consolidations. His HRCT scan demonstrated extensive ground-glass opacities and consolidation, plus an extensive pneumomediastinum with air tracking up to the roots of the neck, creating subcutaneous emphysema. This was managed conservatively, but on the 21st day after hospital admission, he experienced oxygen desaturation to an arterial oxygen saturation of 70%, despite receiving maximal oxygen therapy via a rebreathing mask. He was transferred to the ICU, where a chest radiograph confirmed small (ie, < 10%) bilateral apical pneumothoraces. He was able to maintain borderline oxygenation while receiving maximal oxygen therapy. Chest drain insertion and mechanical ventilation were refused by the patient. Serial chest radiographs showed a gradual reduction in the size of the pneumothoraces. An HRCT scan performed on day 31 after hospital admission showed only a small residual pneumothorax on the right side and a slowly resolving pneumomediastinum.

The factors taken into consideration included the severe compromise of each patient's lung function, which contributed to high anesthetic risk, and, most importantly, the ongoing SARS in each patient, which posed a potential infection risk to all operating room staff.12 It was envisaged that endotracheal intubation, positive-pressure ventilation, lung manipulation during surgery, and the process of postoperative extubation might increase the risk of releasing virus-laden droplets into the operating theater environment. In the presence of a new infectious disease, the means of transmission of which had not been determined at the time, this represented a serious consideration. In case 1, the abundance of pleural adhesions noted on chest radiograph and CT scan also would give rise to a difficult operation with the possibility of intraoperative bleeding and significant postoperative air leakage. This added consideration mitigated against surgery for that patient. Using treatment with chest drainage alone, the air leaks in the four patients spontaneously resolved after a mean duration of 23.5 days (range, 14 to 31 days). In all six cases, pleurodesis, either chemical or surgical, was not used.",

The ICU admission rate (66.7%) and the crude mortality rate (33.3%) were higher in these six patients than those in the 138 patients in the earlier study from PWH (23.2% and 13.8%, respectively).2 That previous study from our institute also had identified absolute neutrophil counts and high peak LDH levels as independent predictors of adverse outcome in SARS patients.2, 9 The mean neutrophil counts and mean peak LDH levels in the 32 patients with poorer clinical courses (those who were either admitted to the ICU or died because of SARS) were significantly higher than those in the other 106 patients not requiring ICU support. In our six patients, the mean neutrophil count was 14.5 \u00d7 10 neutrophils per liter, and the mean peak LDH level was 655.5 U/L. In comparison, the mean figures for the 32 patients with poorer clinical courses in the earlier study were 4.6 \u00d7 10 neutrophils per liter and 629.7 U/L, respectively. Patients with particularly severe clinical courses, and those with high peak LDH levels and neutrophil counts therefore appear to be the most at risk for developing spontaneous pneumothoraces. In particular, the trend for a higher neutrophil count in our six patients suggests that this may be an indicator for SARS patients who are at risk for developing spontaneous pneumothorax.",

In postmortem analyses of other SARS patients, including patients from both PWH and UCH, evidence of histologic damage to the lung tissue by the disease previously has been reported.2, 9, 14 The pulmonary pathology has been reported to be dominated by diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation. The diffuse alveolar damage may give rise to dilated, cystic airspaces in severe cases and a gross appearance of honeycombing. Such destructive changes may predispose the lung to air leakage from the rupture of the cystic lesions, with the consequent development of a pneumothorax. The frequent diffuse involvement of both lungs by these changes also could account for the occurrence of the bilateral pneumothoraces seen in three of our six patients in this series.",

Although the experience in Hong Kong has shown steroids to be of value in controlling the rapid and damaging host inflammatory response,8, 9 we appreciate the concerns of others16 regarding the potential for steroid-related complications (including an increased risk of infection and impaired wound healing). It can be speculated as to whether aggressive steroid therapy may have a role to play in the pathogenesis of spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS patients. Indeed, the use of steroids to dampen the harmful inflammatory response has become one of the mainstays in the treatment of patients severely afflicted with SARS in Hong Kong.7, 8 We note that the doses of methylprednisolone received by the six patients reported on are no higher than those given to other SARS patients at PWH and UCH with similar clinical presentations. However, therapy with steroids may delay wound healing and perpetuate air leakage. The high doses of steroids given to the patients in cases 1, 3, 4, and 5 may be partly responsible for the persistent air leaks observed in these patients. In our six patients, no incidence of superinfection secondary to steroid use was noted.",
