(ii) What is the distribution of the peak infection rate over the lifecycle of the epidemic? The reason for focusing on (i) is that the level of herd immunity attained is an important policy tool in knowing how, when, and by how much social distancing measures can be relaxed. The reason for focusing on (ii) is that the peak infection rate corresponds to the most overloaded instance that a health service encounters over the lifecycle of an epidemic. Success in both the above dimensions is not simultaneously possible because as one goes up the other goes down. Our results help to guide what the relative trade-offs are.",

This means it is the way in which the societies are organised, and not the overall level of interaction, that is being varied. We initialise each trial with 1% of the population infected, using the COVID-19 disease parameters calibrated in Toda (2020). Table 1 ). Moderate social distancing (defined as 4-5 interactions per period) delays the peak of an epidemic but has little effect on the size of the peak and on the number that the disease ultimately reaches. The effect of mild social distancing (limiting individuals to 10 social interactions) differs greatly across network structures. With a ERG network, the effect is negligible. With a WS network, the outcome is the same as no intervention. With a BA network, the peak is significantly reduced. This is because in the BA network there are a small number of individuals with lots of connections, who, without constraints imposed may act as \"super-spreaders\". 3 Our framework is flexible enough to address a host of other policy experiments. For example, we consider a network comprised of two densely connected components, interpreted as 'countries', that have a few connections between them that we interpret as international friendships. We show that the benefits to a country that imposes strong social distancing measures are dramatically reduced if it continues to allow international connections, interpreted as maintaining open borders, with a country that is not implementing similar measures. In a hyper-connected world this points to the need for 'global' cooperation to eradicate an epidemic. In particular, if the global approach is uncoordinated with each country unilaterally applying social distancing measures without taking into account the policy choices of its neighbours, then an infectious disease may cycle around for far longer than otherwise intended. (During the COVID-19 pandemic, some Asian countries, e.g., Hong Kong and Singapore, have experienced second waves after successfully eradicating the virus during its first outbreak.)",

Our results show that when 10% of the population is deemed essential, the reach of the epidemic is similar to that wherein there are no essential workers. Finally, we consider a policy of beginning with severe social distancing measures that are incrementally relaxed over time, and compare the outcome with that from a policy of mild but constant social distancing over a shorter window. We find that the public health outcome is better under gradual relaxation for ERG networks and WS networks, but worse for BA networks.",

This ensures we are comparing like-for-like since it is the way in which the societies are organised, and not the overall level of interaction, that is being varied. Given that the number of edges in each graph will be nd/2, some straightforward algebra yields the following parameter requirements: p =d n\u22121 for ERG, k =d 2 for WS, and m = nd\u2212m 0 (m 0 \u22121) 2(n\u2212m 0 ) for BA. In each network we fix the number of vertices to be n = 1, 000 and set d = 10. Such a choice requires setting the ERG parameter p = 0.01. For WS we choose rewiring probability q = 0.1 and k = 5. For the BA network we set m 0 = 1. We set the removal probability \u03b3 = 0.1. To calibrate \u03b2, we proceed as follows. Since average degree isd, an infected individual will infect \u03b2d others in one period and on average \u03b2d/\u03b3 over the infectious period when social distancing is unconstrained. The expression \u03b2d/\u03b3 must equal the reproductive number which is calibrated to be 3 in Toda (2020). Given this, we have that \u03b2 = 0.03. Finally, we initialise the system by setting each vertex to state I with probability y 0 = 0.01 (so that, on average, each trial starts with 1% of the population infected).",

However, for the BA network, conditional on the disease not being eradicated the distribution of peak infection rate for N max = 5 is sandwiched between that of N max = 10 and N max = \u221e. At first glance this may appear mysterious but in fact it is not. The explanation is that the distribution of peak infection rate presented says nothing about the precise moment, during a particular trial, that the peak infection rate was attained. For N max = 5, the peak infection rate will typically occur after the social distancing restrictions have been lifted (as can be seen clearly in the left hand panel of ERG), but this is not the case for N max = 10. For BA networks, it would appear that setting N max = 10 is a superior policy to the policy to setting N max = 5. Table 1 presents further results. The variable 'Peak' denotes the peak infection rate.
