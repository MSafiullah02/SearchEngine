            "text": "Mammalian cells expose wide arrays of complex glycoconjugates on their surfaces. These carbohydrate structures are playing critical roles in multiple key cellular events, several of which being characterized by weak but multivalent carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions.1 Thus, multiantennary glycans on glycoproteins, polysaccharides, or on patches of glycolipids constitute a first line of weak contacts with pathogens bearing the corresponding carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). Cell\u2013cell communications also apply carbohydrates as signals. In spite of these ubiquitous phenomena, the basic carbohydrate structures recognized by carbohydrate-binding proteins are surprisingly simple, with at best a tri- or tetrasaccharide moiety being deeply involved in the protein's active sites, unless conformational epitopes are involed.2 Additionally, several proteins or interactive mechanisms utilize a limited set of similar sugars, thus further raising the issues of selectivities. For instance, the innate immune system exploits the structures of mannosides on yeast, fungi, and bacteria through the mannose-binding protein (MBP) as the first defense mechanism against this type of infectious agents. Yet, dendritic cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes also utilize mannosides against pathogens and cellular recognition or activation. Paradoxically, bacteria, such as fimbriated Escherichia coli (E. coli), possess proteins at the tip of their fimbriae (FimH) that also recognize and bind to mannosides of host human tissues as the premise for bacterial infections. Obviously then, the sole carbohydrate structures, taken individually, could not account for the large multivalent interactions that solicit a given glycan. Consequently, valencies, geometries, and topographical saccharide arrangements must be keys for the high selectivities and affinities observed. With these questions in mind, glycodendrimers3, 4, 5, 6 were born to address fundamental aspects in multivalent carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions that could not be resolved with glycopolymers.7, 8, 9 Moreover, dendrimers can be assembled with an infinite variety of chemical architectures and exposed number of carbohydrate moieties.10, 10a, 10b, 11 They may also constitute an arsenal of new therapeutic agents as well as being useful for specific cell targeting.",

One such possibility would be the inhibition of attachment of the infecting pathogens to the host's cell surfaces.12, 13, 14 The attachment is often a prerequisite for the later stages of infection, colonization, and invasion of specific human tissues. Since the chemical structure of the adhesion inhibitors most likely would be quite similar to the natural attachment ligands used by the pathogenic agents, it is unlikely that resistance (mutations) would give them the capability to overcome the inhibitory effect of the antiadhesive drug without impairing their ability to adhere to the host cells. Glycodendrimers are therefore definitely suitable for the inhibition of bacterial adhesions to host tissues (Figure 1\n).",

The two binding sites are 35 \u00c5 apart; thus, a single Man9GlcNAc2 residue is too small to provide a chelate effect on the two active sites simultaneously. Figure 3 illustrates the X-ray structure of the protein with bound Man9GlcNAc2 in its high-affinity site together with the bound conformation of the saccharide.

Thus, simultaneous ligation of three binding sites could not be achieved by a single molecule but rather elongated branched oligosaccharides as found on the cell walls of yeast, certain Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, and the envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus, all of which have been shown to bind to MBP. This suggests that the CRD sites are ideally configured for multivalent interactions, thereby increasing the binding affinity of hMBP to pathogens. Our group has been involved in the design of optimal mannoside trimers to provide potent chelators to hMBP and to better understand differentiating interactions between this protein and other high-mannose binding proteins (Dominique, R. and Roy, R., unpublished data).",

In a recent study from this laboratory (unpublished data), a small library of mannoside analogs was constructed to build a QSAR model for the FimH. The library included several C-linked mannosides, a few of which (cpds 6, 7) were almost equivalent to PNP\u03b1Man. These C-glycosides are valuable candidates for in vivo assays since they are stable under physiological conditions. Moreover, they are suitably functionalized for further manipulations such as those encountered in typical glycodendrimer syntheses.

Polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM, Starburst, Dendritic Nanotechnologies), polypropylenimine (PPI, Astramol, DSM Fine Chemicals), polyglycerols, and Boltorn\u00ae dendrimers are most commonly used.10, 10a, 10b PAMAM-based dendrimers53 having built-in amine functionalities on the surfaces have been the first and most frequently used scaffolds for sugar attachment. The very first application used amide bond formation starting from sugar lactones.54 Although this straightforward manipulation has not yet been applied toward mannosides, it should be readily applicable to this important carbohydrate. It has the disadvantage of sacrificing the reducing sugars, which alternatively serve as extended linkers. As discussed in more details below, PAMAM (and potentially any other amine-ending dendrimers) have been functionalized with carbohydrates using: (1) thiourea linkages formed by treating the aminated dendrimers with sugar isothiocyanates; (2) amide linkages with carboxylated sugars; and (3) reductive amination. This last procedure can give rise to mixtures of both mono- and di-alkylation. The largest glycodendrimer built so far contained 256 mannoside residues and was prepared on generation G6-PAMAM dendrimer.55\n",

In this approach, the focal and multifunctional molecules are systematically expanded outward using various chemical linkages. For instance, PAMAM-based dendrimers use \u03b1,\u03c9-diamines as core (e.g., 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,4-butanediamine, etc.), the amines of which are then treated with methyl acrylate by a double N-alkylation. The ensuing esters are reacted with a large excess of 1,2-ethylenediamine to provide the first generation G0 bearing four amine functionalities. This process (alkylation/amidation) is sequentially repeated from the \u2018heart\u2019 of the molecules until the desired external valencies are reached. The sugars are then appended at the molecules' periphery. The growth is doubly exponential (2n) but the number of surface groups may vary depending on the number of functionalities on the \u2018seeding\u2019 molecules, for example, 2,4,8\u2026; 3,6,12\u2026; 4,8,16\u2026; etc. The main disadvantage of the divergent growth is the necessity for an increasing number of efficacious reactions required to obtain defect-free dendrimers that are otherwise difficult to purify given the small differences in their size and number of functional groups.",

The procedure involves the construction of glycodendrons (wedges) that are useful on their own followed by their attachment to multivalent core structures. The procedure is simplified because the number of coupling partners is reduced to a minimum at any particular step. Moreover, the target molecules, by virtue of its higher molecular weight in comparison to their fragments are simpler to purify by size exclusion chromatography. The number of peripheral carbohydrate moieties that cause steric inaccessibility eventually limits the technique. Nevertheless, it is now well established that a large number of surface carbohydrate moieties are detrimental to the carbohydrate accessibility by carbohydrate-binding receptors. Doubly convergent approaches have also been described. In these cases, the core molecules are first assembled with several surface functional groups that could be directly attached to glycodendrons.",

Using dendrons having eight sialosides on the surface, Roy et al. were able to demonstrate that each saccharide residue was 1000-fold better, on a per saccharide basis than the corresponding monomer.57 They were however not as efficient as polymers because they could not cover efficiently the surfaces of the spherical viral particles, a property well exploited by random coiled polymers. It was later argued that dendronized polymers were even more potent in this respect.57 When the same poly-l-lysine scaffold was utilized with mannoside residues bearing an arylated aglycon (partly optimized monomer), the resulting 8-mer glycondendron happened to show 100 000-fold increased inhibitory potency against fimbriated E. coli K12 on a per mannoside basis.58 The structures of the corresponding sialo-(Figure 10) and manno-dendrimers (Figure 11\n) are illustrated below.",

The lysine moieties were then introduced as a G-3 lysine dendrimer followed by mannosylation, using 4-mannosyloxy butanoic acid (8) at the terminal (\u03f5) amino groups of the lysyl-peptide dendrimer (9). Preliminary data from vaccine 10, containing the LLSGIV motif, demonstrated that it could elicit polyclonal antibodies response in rabbit much stronger than the KLH construct. It was concluded that the mannosylated dendron was stabilizing the antigenicity of the peptide by protecting it from proteolysis. N-terminally mannosylated peptides carrying one to six mannose residues were also shown by Koning and co-workers to elicit immune response with efficiency up to 104-fold greater than peptide antigens alone.68\n",

In more complex carbohydrate-based glycodendrimers, this situation may lead to undesired partial structures. To circumvent it, Stoddart et al. in their sialodendrimers syntheses targeting siglecs, used an N-methyl amine for the reductive amination.81, 81a\n",

This is suggestive of a glycoside clustering effect (enhanced local concentration). As with G1 and G2, G3 was too small for multivalent binding to occur (chelate effect). Dendrimers G4\u2013G6 all showed increased activity against the tetrameric Con A of two orders of magnitude, indicating that multivalent binding was occurring. It is also possible that the change in shape from circular (G(1)- to G(3)-PAMAM) to spherical (G4\u2013G6) caused the observed binding enhancement. It is to be noted that each of the four mannose-binding sites in ConA is \u223c73 \u00c5 apart from each other (calcium to calcium distances).

The area available per sugar at maximum activity varied slightly for the different generations. The trends were similar in each case. The most striking observation was that the highest activity did not correlate with the maximum sugar loading, but rather occurred at slightly closer packing of the sugars as the generation increased. By analogy, the loading distributions of dendrimers bearing heterogeneous structures were evaluated. Hence, mannoside/TEMPO-functionalized PAMAM dendrimers were synthesized.87 EPR analysis of these dendrimers suggested that all dendrimers had random distributions of surface functional groups.

The second category, the hyperbranched polymers are attractive because they resemble dendrimers (their difference lies in their polydispersity and the less-perfect globular shape) but they can be produced more easily on a larger scale and at a reasonable cost, thus making them commercially available in large quantities nowadays. Unlike conventional polymers, the high number of end groups and their nature participate actively in the physical properties (solubility, glass transition temperature, and viscosity) in combination with the backbone structures. This characteristic is exceptional because it leads to the possibility of designing the macromolecule with the combination of many different end groups.",

Alternatively, the catalytic Cu(i) species could be generated in situ from CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate.105, 105a The latter method eliminates the problem of by-product formation and has been used successfully in several different solvent systems, including water. In this method, the need for prior exclusion of oxygen or the presence of a nitrogen base could be abolished.",

This procedure was successfully used to obtain clusters bearing methyl (69) and p-nitrophenyl (70) aglycons after branching through the C-6 amino position. The latter is of interest as aromatic moieties can increase the affinity of a given carbohydrate ligand to its lectin receptor by hydrophobic interactions. The inhibitory potency of p-nitrophenyl \u03b1-d-mannoside (pNPMan) was approximately 100 times higher than that of the respective methyl mannoside. Cluster 69 (R = CH3) showed an IC50 of 4 nM and has surpassed the inhibitory potency of the cluster containing pNPMan. Only the spacer-modified mannosides 71 revealed interesting successful inhibition of type-1 fimbriae-mediated adhesion of E. coli to high mannose-type surfaces. None of these compounds reached the inhibitory potency of 69 (R = CH3). These results were however somewhat surprising given the fact that fimbriated E. coli (FimH) prefers to bind mannosides from the nonreducing end (see Figure 7), thus providing no room for the clusters to enter in the active site by their reducing end.",

It was originally developed for peptide synthesis and then oligonucleotide synthesis but is now widely applied to oligosaccharide chemistry. Combinatorial chemistry applied to solid-phase techniques is now broadly used in organic synthesis. Takahashi and co-workers have reported an elegant solid-phase combinatorial synthesis of a carbohydrate cluster on a tree-type linker, where subsequent orthogonal cleavage provided dimer and tetramer 105 and 106 (Figure 42\n).144 Ether formation between bromide 98 and bisazido alcohol 99 under two phase conditions gave the desired tetraazide 100 which upon Staudinger reduction with aqueous PPh3 followed by Fmoc protection of the resulting amine provided intermediate 101. The formation of the resin-loaded tree-type dendron precursor 102 was successfully achieved by THP deprotection, attachment to an aminated resin through succinylation, and treatment with bromoacetic acid (DIC, HOBt) after Fmoc deprotection with 20% piperidine in DMF. Tetrameric mannosylated cluster 104 was then obtained under standard alkaline conditions using thioether formation from thiomannoside 103. Finally, the tetrameric glycocluster was released from the resin by alkaline treatment to provide 105. Interestingly, the dimeric glycocluster 106 could also be released from the resin under acidic treatment of the acetylenic-Co2(CO)8 complex (Nicholas reaction). The tetramer inhibited 40% of the binding of fluorescein-labeled mannosylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) onto peritoneal exudative macrophages.",

Hypervalent glycocalix[4]arene dendrimers demonstrated direct binding to VVA by the rapid formation of insoluble precipitates. The efficiency of glycocalixarenes to inhibit the binding of asialoglycophorin, a natural glycoprotein of human erythrocytes-blood group serotype, was measured by ELLA. The best result was obtained from the hexadecavalent conjugate (IC50, 13.4 mM), which represents a 12-fold increase in potency over that of allyl \u03b1-d-GalNAc monomer (IC50, 158.3 mM). The prepared glycocalixarene derivatives were also directly adsorbed onto the lipophilic surface of polystyrene microtiter plates and thus should be useful in bioanalytical devices. p-Tert-butylcalix[4]arene was also used by Roy and Meunier for the synthesis of \u03b1-sialylated-calix[4]arene.121 Evidences for strong cross-linking ability with tetrameric wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a plant lectin known to bind sialosides, was detected with this tetramer.",

Unless otherwise stated, this report has only presented those involving mannoside residues with the hope to sensitize the community with the broad arsenal of molecules available and perhaps to stimulate others to come. In spite of the fact that this relatively novel family of small macromolecules has been discovered in 1993, it is somewhat surprising that there are still no architectural rules governing the synthesis of the best candidates for any given applications. Through our own personal experience, we could conclude that, for now, glycopolymers still represent the most efficient candidates for targeting viral particles. However, with the scarce information available, it appeared that dendronized glycopolymers might offer clear advantages. The situation seems to be dramatically different when dealing with fimbriated bacteria and certainly so, to multimeric soluble carbohydrate-binding proteins such as lectins, galectins, antibodies, and so on. It is also somewhat surprising that the community has not yet concented for the use of the same bacterial strains when dealing with the inhibition of adhesion of fimbriated E. coli and related pathogens. This situation will have to be remedied in the near future if one wants to establish governing rules for the design of better and improved adhesion inhibitors.",
