But for the application of circulation air in the concept of the dynamic isolation, there are several principles:The circulation air does not mean the circulation of the return air in the central system for different rooms. It is the self-circulation for the air in each room.There must be a proportion of circulation air to be exhausted outdoors, so that negative pressure can be kept indoors. On the exhaust air outlet, HEPA filter must be installed.The exhaust air outlet and the return air outlet can be combined to be one apparatus. HEPA filter could be shared for both the exhaust air and the return air.The exhaust air outlet and the return air outlet are not required to be free of leakage.\n",

Chemical and physical disinfection methods were utilized indoors. This kind of treatment methods with pollution at first and then control is termed as the passive treatment. It will yield twice the result with half the effort. Besides, it is a method with sequela. It is not a method to control pollution during the whole process. Instead, it only pays attention to pollution control at the beginning and the end.In hospitals the objects where disinfection is needed include: occupant, surfaces of object, and air. For occupant, hands need to be disinfected. People needs to take a bath and wear aseptic clothes.For surfaces of object, it should be wiped clean. The following methods may be used, which include the disinfection with chemical agent (more than one type must be used), the moist heat sterilization, the dry heat sterilization, the radiation sterilization, the gas sterilization, sterilization with air filtration (when sterilization cannot be performed eventually in the container).Examples of air disinfection methodTable 3.15 illustrates various methods for air disinfection, where the air disinfection efficiencies were shown in the product catalog, literatures, claim from manufacturer or the test report.Table 3.16 illustrates the measured result on electrostatic sterilization equipment performed by experts from Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences [17].Table 3.17 shows the report from Chinese Journal of Nosocomiology [18].

This is different from \u201csterilization at the beginning\u201d or \u201csterilization at the end\u201d.Both dust and bacteria are removedBy using the principle of physical barrier, air filter can remove dust, as well as microbes (including bacteria and virus). Since microbes are carried by particles, bacteria can be removed during the removing process of dust.No generation of other gradientsSome sterilization method may generate toxic gases such as nitrogen oxides or ozone. However, air filtration is a pure physical method, which will not generate other gradients.No side effect of generating toxic materialSome sterilization method may generate radiation, which is harmful to occupant\u2019s health. Some generated electric field or magnetic field has influence on instrument and equipment. Some may promote the mutation of bacteria. For example, this will occur during the UV irradiation. The drug resistance of the bacteria may become very strong.High and complete sterilization efficiencyFor HEPA filter, the sterilization efficiency could reach more than 99.99999%. The sterilization performance is complete. There are no semi-lethal bacteria left, which may revive afterwards. For bacteria suffering UV irradiation, they may revive under the light if they are not killed by irradiation. Bacteria corpse or secretion will not left if HEPA filter is used.Broad-spectrum of sterilization efficiency and easy for selectionThe range of sterilization efficiency for different products is from 10 to 99.999999%, while that of other sterilization methods is very narrow, which is from 70 to 90%.It is not selective for dust and bacteria removalThe performance of some sterilization method such as the electrostatic method is influenced by the conductivity property of the dust particles. Some sterilization method is selective for the type of bacteria, which means the sensitivity level is different.For example, the UV-C ray with wavelength 253.7 nm has different sensitivity levels for various microbes, which is shown in Table 3.23 [23].\nIt is a method to prevent aerosol and airborne microbes from entering into the air ducts.\n\n",
