Patient falls are the most frequent adverse event in hospitals and often cause serious patient outcomes. In this work, we describe the experience of the Local Healthcare Authority of Romagna, Italy that, within the framework of a quality and safety improvement programme, designed, developed and implemented a desktop application for monitoring inpatient falls. A multidisciplinary team created a software tool based on R, an open source software for statistical computing that, appropriately combined with the existing hospital information system, is used to obtain Shewhart ucontrol charts for monitoring the monthly fall rates. The tool had been implemented in twenty nine hospital units. The results indicate that the proposed application gave a valuable contribution in the safety improvement activities. Its usefulness extended beyond the \"safety problem\" as it also enabled hospital managers to identify a number of critical issues in data collection. As a result, where necessary, improvement actions had been implemented. Furthermore, the use of open source software led to a considerable cost reduction and facilitated customization of the software tool.",

In such a way each hospital unit has a control chart with a central line which represents its \"in-control\" or steady state performance.
