Gita Gopinath from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed out that due to the impact of the COVID-19, the global economy would experience a recession in 2020, and the economic growth rate would drop to \u22123% (Gopinath, 2020). This result is 6.3% lower than the forecast in the World Economic Outlook released by the IMF in January 2020. The COVID-19 is considered to negatively affect the world economy due to two main reasons. First, the rapid spread of the epidemic worldwide has directly led to a sharp increase in the uncertainty of economic development, which has triggered turbulence in financial and capital markets (McKibbin and Fernando, 2020). Secondly, in order to control the spread of the epidemic, countries have strictly restricted the movement of people and transportation, and economic activities have been greatly reduced (Fernandes, 2020), which puts pressure on economic operations from both consumption and production sides. Many scholars forecast that the effect of the COVID-19 on the economy will outweigh that of the 2008 financial crisis.",

For the purpose of systematically evaluating the dynamic impact of the COVID-19 on the environment, this paper takes China as a case study and conduct an in-depth discussion on the changes of major environmental pollutant emissions during the period from outbreak, spread to basic control of the COVID-19. This study not only provides a theoretical reference for other countries to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the environment, but also enriches the theoretical research on the relationship between economy and pollution from an emergency-economy-environment perspective.",

From January 23 to February 4, China's daily reported cases has accelerated, which means that the population infected with COVID-19 further expanded. From February 5th to 11th, the number of confirmed cases per day has decreased, indicating that the quarantine measures are effective in suppressing the spread of the virus. Moreover, China extended the Spring Festival holiday, which results in the population mobility during the Spring Festival in 2020 being much lower than that during the Spring Festival in 2019 (Hu, 2019). After February 12, the number of daily confirmed cases gradually declined and eased.

Chinese provincial governments announced strict restrictions on movement, from checkpoints at building entrances to outdoor activities. These measures include traffic restrictions on all non-emergency vehicles and the closure of all non-essential public places. Residents of every city only get the necessities of life from the neighborhood committee and community committee, because of the policy of quarantine. Many cities closed train stations to prevent people from entering the city unless they are proved live or work there. In the countryside, villages are separated by vehicles, tents and other temporary barriers. In terms of economy, a large number of enterprises stopped production.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is an important transportation hub in Wuhan, and the road became empty after the government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan (Fig. 3\n). In the next two weeks, >80 cities in China from 15 provinces (including municipalities and autonomous regions) were placed on lockdown, and implemented closed management of urban residential areas.

The main conclusions of this paper are as follows.(1)The outbreak of COVID-19 improved China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributed to global carbon emissions reduction. From the time dimension, China's energy consumption dropped sharply during the outbreak of COVID-19, especially the total coal consumption. And COVID-19 effectively suppressed the GHG emissions such as CO2. However, the observed data indicate that this beneficial effect only occurs during quarantine. As some regions in China lifted the lockdown and enterprises resumed production, people and goods began to flow on a large scale. Meanwhile, declining energy consumption is showing an upward trend, and traffic congestion is gradually returning to the level before quarantine. It can be deduced from this that when China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes production, its energy use and GHG emissions are likely to exceed the level before the outbreak.(2)The COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of NO2 in the atmosphere. This reduction initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. From a spatial perspective, the reduction of environmental pollutants initially appeared in areas with severe epidemics because they firstly implemented strict restrictions. Subsequently, more and more regions adopted quarantine measures and implemented traffic control. As a result, the air quality throughout the country improved significantly. This phenomenon seems to imply a close correlation between the economy and environmental pollution. The reduction in economic activities and traffic restrictions directly affects the changes in China's energy consumption, and effectively reduce the generation of environmental pollution.(3)This study enriches the theoretical research on economic and environmental pollution in the context of extreme events. The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 is an extreme event and a global emergency public health event. The systematic analysis of the relationship between economic growth and environmental pollution during the outbreak can not only provide a reference for other countries to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the environment, but also enrich the theoretical research on the relationship between economy and pollution from an emergency-economy-environment perspective.\n",
