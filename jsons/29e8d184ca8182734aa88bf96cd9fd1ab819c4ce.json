It explores the main public health threats and focuses speci fi cally on the changing perception of bioterrorism as a potential threat to the country. Furthermore, it explains how this perception is re fl ected in the existing legal framework and administrative structures. The paper makes the case for the further development of an integrated, fl exible and sustainable national management system to respond effectively to emergencies and presents the major challenges for the country in this fi eld. It makes a comparison between military and civilian agencies in their preparedness to respond to naturally occurring emergencies and threats of biological attack. This review points out the higher but still limited capacity of the military medical facilities in Bulgaria. The overall evaluation underlines the need for further strengthening of the relationship between military and civil capabilities and between public healthcare and security and law enforcement structures. As a result the authors make the case for stronger cooperation between military and civil medical facilities as well as for inter-institutional and interdisciplinary dialogue on the expert and political level on biopreparedness in Bulgaria.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The aim of this contribution is to map the current situation in Bulgaria's public healthcare system with regard to bioterrorism response.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In Bulgaria public health and biopreparedness are still regarded as two independent public policies.
