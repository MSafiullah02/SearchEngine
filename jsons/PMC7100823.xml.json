Although it is well recognized that mechanical ventilation is the most important risk factor for the development of pneumonia, trauma patients appear to particularly susceptible. Up to 44% of trauma patients who require mechanical ventilation develop ventilator-associated pneumonia [1\u20133]. While pneumonia can develop in any trauma patient after injury, patients injured in motor vehicle collisions are more likely to develop pneumonia than patients injured by other mechanisms [4].",

Finally, the third category consists of probable or possible ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs), a term applied to patients with IVAC who also have laboratory evidence of respiratory infection. This is further qualified by the presence of white blood cells on gram stain of respiratory secretions or the presence of respiratory pathogens on culture [9\u2022\u2022]. Although somewhat burdensome, the new definitions are thought to help with uniformity in reporting and should help to promote surveillance [7].

Contemporary techniques include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and mini-BAL. These and other techniques are reviewed in detail elsewhere [1]. In brief, BAL involves sampling airway secretions directly using bronchoscopy. It is an invasive technique that samples approximately one million alveoli [1, 44]. BAL has been studied in trauma patients for the diagnosis of pneumonia, and one study demonstrated that BAL could reliably distinguish pneumonia from ARDS in these patients when the quantitative culture from BAL grew a pathogen at a concentration of at least 105 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL [45].

This can be best accomplished by instituting daily paired spontaneous awakening and breathing trials in the ICU.
