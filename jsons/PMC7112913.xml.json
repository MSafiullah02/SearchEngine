Currently, based on their antigenic and genetic relatedness, coronaviruses are classified into three groups. CCoV is included in group I, along with TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PDEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E).",

            "text": "Usually, coronaviruses have a strong potential for mutation which accounts for the number of new viral genotypes or mutants with different tissue or host tropism that have emerged in the last few years. Two CCoV genotypes, CCoV type 1 and CCoV type 2, have been identified so far (Pratelli et al., 2003a). CCoV-I has higher genetic relatedness to feline coronavirus type I (FCoVI) in the S gene than does CCoV type II; it also has an accessory gene (ORF3, 624 nucleotides in length) which is absent in other coronaviruses (Lorusso et al., 2008). Dogs with acute gastroenteritis may be detected with only CCoV-1 in their faeces, or with both CCoV-I and CCoV-II (Pratelli et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2005). The identification of ORF3 remnants in the CCoV-II and TGEV platforms has led to hypothesis that these viruses recognize CCoV-I as their possible ancestor (Lorusso et al., 2008). CCoV-II strains with high virulence have been described (Sanchez-Morgado et al., 2004, Evermann et al., 2005, Escutenaire et al., 2007), including a pantropic variant that caused systemic disease in pups and virus spread to internal organs (Buonavoglia et al., 2006, Decaro et al., 2007, Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008). In addition, recombination has been reported between CCoV-II and CCoV-I (Escutenaire et al., 2007) or TGEV (Wesley, 1999, Decaro et al., 2009). Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome (8.8 kb) have showed that some CCoV-II strains are strictly related to TGEV in the N-terminal domain of the S protein, whereas in the C-terminus of the S protein and in other genes encoding for structural and accessory protein, they resemble classical CCoV-II isolates. Classification of CCoV-II into two different sub-types, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb has been suggested because of the genetic and antigenic differences between classical CCoV and TGEV-like viruses (Decaro et al., 2009).",

The identification of TGEV-like CCoV strains in dogs raises a number of questions as to whether CCoV-IIb strains are of epidemiological relevance in dogs and these viruses biologically differ from classical CCoVs. Also, it is uncertain whether and to which extent the observed antigenic differences between CCoV-IIa and -IIb (Decaro et al., 2009) may impact on CCoV prophylaxis, e.g. if dogs immunized with CCoV-IIa-based vaccines may be effectively protected against infection and disease by TGEV-like CCoVs.",

            "text": "The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and simple assay for the serological diagnosis of CCoV-IIb (TGEV-like), able to distinguish clearly CCoV-IIb-elicited immunity. The recent development of ELISAs based on recombinant proteins has allowed the development of serological tests of high specificity. In the present study the initial portion of the S protein of a TGEV-like CCoV was expressed in order to avoid cross-reactions between classical and TGEV-like CCoV strains. This polypeptide spans the cross-over region where recombination is thought to have occurred between TGEV and CCoV-II, leading to the generation of a chimerical S protein, and more likely accounts for the observed antigenic differences. The recombinant polypeptide was successfully produced in E. coli cell-free system with a poly-histidine tag that was used for protein identification and purification. The r-S\u2032 was then used in an ELISA test for the detection of antibodies specific for CCoV-IIb in dogs. The negative control sera did not react with the r-S\u2032, while all the serum samples obtained from animals infected experimentally with the CCoV-IIb strain 174/06 displayed high OD values. As expected, the sera of the dogs vaccinated or infected experimentally with CCoV-IIa viruses did not react in the r-S\u2032-based ELISA, displaying negative OD values. By converse, these sera tested highly positive in the whole-virus antigen ELISA. Accordingly, the ELISA based on the r-S\u2032 of CCoV-IIb was able to recognize specifically the antibodies raised to the homologous virus. Since mixed infections or sequential exposure to various CCoV strains might occur under field conditions (Pratelli et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2005), this test cannot distinguish between the antibodies elicited by a CCoV-IIb single infection and the antibodies elicited by mixed CCoV-IIa/IIb infections, since in both cases the whole-antigen ELISA and r-S\u2032-based ELISA would test positive. If necessary, a recombinant ELISA test specific for classical CCoV strains (CCoV-IIa) should be set up in order to confirm or rule out exposure to double infections.",
