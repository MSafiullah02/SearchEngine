Our rationale was to select sequences from the loop regions as these regions would potentially be more accessible to cells, and therefore may be more biologically active. The N\u2010domains were chosen, because in our earlier study only peptides from the N\u2010domain of CEACAM1 had biological activity in neutrophil activation (67). Hydropathy plots were also done using Kyte\u2212Doolittle and Chou\u2212Fassman analyses, and the results were consistent in that the chosen sequences coincided with hydrophilic regions. The sequences were then standardized to a length of 14 amino acid residues, because this length results in a relatively high yield of peptides during synthesis, and corresponds to peptides made in our earlier study of CEACAM1. In order to complete this standardization, amino acid residues were added to the amino or carboxyl ends of the sequences. We also attempted to avoid having cysteine residues appear in the final sequences, as peptide dimerization may then occur. Our final selection of peptides to be synthesized is shown in Table 1.",

Briefly, HUVECs (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA, USA) were passaged 1:5 in T\u201025 flasks (Costar) no more than three times before plating in 96\u2010well microtiter plates at 3000 cells/well. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well microtiter plates in EGM media (Clonetics) and fed every 24 h. Using the adhesion assay described below, no difference in resting and stimulated neutrophil adhesion was observed, and, as expected (72), no difference in surface expression of CD54 (ICAM\u20101) or CD62E (E selectin, ELAM\u20101) in resting or TNF\u2010stimulated cells was noted using HUVECs passaged once compared with those passaged five times. In some experiments, the HUVECs were stimulated by culture for the indicated time with TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Cetus, Emeryville, CA, USA). The wells were then washed four times with adhesion buffer (DMEM + 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum; HIFBS) and 25 \u00b5L of adhesion buffer containing the indicated peptide was added to each well, followed immediately by 100 \u00b5L of adhesion buffer containing 105 calcein\u2010labeled cells. Twenty\u2010five microliters of adhesion buffer containing the indicated concentration of FMLP was then added, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 30 min. The wells were then aspirated and washed four times with endo wash buffer (HBSS + 4% HIFBS), and the fluorescence was quantitated with a Millipore fluorescence plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm.

To determine if an alteration in the surface expression of CD11/CD18 could contribute to the effect of the CD66e\u20103 peptide on neutrophil adhesion, CD11b expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Because CD11 and CD18 are translocated to the cell surface only when they are complexed with each other, the use of a directly labeled CD11b mAb was used to demonstrate upregulation of CD18 as well as CD11b. When neutrophils were incubated with HBSS for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and then reacted with a PE\u2010labeled CD11b mAb, CD11b expression was readily detected by flow cytometry (MCF = 584) (Fig. 3, left, upper panel).

These peptides are homologous to a series of peptides from CEACAM1 that we described previously (67) that included three peptides that had activity in an assay examining stimulated neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs. These same three peptides also stimulated upregulation of CD11b/CD18 and downregulation of CD62L on the neutrophil surface. Thus, previous data suggested that peptide motifs from at least three regions of the N\u2010terminal domain of human CEACAM1 are involved in the interaction of CEACAM1 with other ligands and can initiate signal transduction in neutrophils. In the current study, although CEACAMs 1, 8, 6 and 3 can all transmit activation signals in neutrophils, only one of the 20 newly synthesized peptides (CD66e\u20103) had biological activity in the neutrophil adhesion assay. Several other studies have proposed structural motifs of CD66a family proteins (7, 22, 54, 76). Although our peptides of 14 amino acid residues in length contain variable numbers of residues from proposed \u03b2\u2010sheet regions, our model is in general similar to other reported models. Although 19 of the 20 peptides tested in this study were not active in this assay, it is possible that they might have functional activity in a different assay.",

First, these proteins are homologous to CEACAM1, second, CEACAMs 8, 6 and 3 can signal in neutrophils, and third, they can undergo homotypic and/or heterotypic adhesion with each other. Fourth, in our previous study, only peptides from the N\u2010domain of CEACAM1 had activity. In addition, studies of transfectants, recombinant proteins and domain\u2010specific mAbs, have suggested that the N\u2010terminal domain is critical for the homotypic and heterotypic adhesion activity of CEACAMs (16, 22, 24, 25, 26, 34, 77). Studies have also suggested that the A1, B1 or A2 domains may also be important in homotypic adhesion, and may interact with the N\u2010domain (16, 20, 21, 23, 24).",

For example, CD66a\u20101 is functionally active whereas peptides CD66c\u20101, CD66d\u20101 and CD66e\u20101, which are identical, and differ from CD66a\u20101 by a single amino acid substitution of M to T, are inactive (Table 2). These data suggest that the sequence of peptide CD66a\u20101 in the SMPF region may be critical for activity. CD66b\u20101 also differs in the SMPF region and is inactive. Similarly, although CD66a\u20102 is functionally active, the homologous peptides CD66b\u20102, CD66c\u20102, CD66d\u20102 and CD66e\u20102, which differ from CD66a\u20102 in the QLFG region, are inactive (Table 2). Thus, these data suggest that the amino acid sequence in this region is critical for activity. CD66d\u20102 and CD66e\u20102, which are identical, differ from CD66a\u20102 by a single nonconservative Q to H substitution. CD66e\u20103 differs from CD66a\u20103 by a single conservative amino substitution at the end of the NRQIV sequence and retains activity (Table 2). In contrast, CD66c\u20103 and CD66d\u20103, which are identical, differ from CD66a\u20103 by a RQ to SL substitution in the NRQIV sequence and are inactive. CD66b\u20103 has a substitution in the NRQIV sequence of QIV to RII. Given the activity of the V to I substitution in CD66e\u20103, this suggests that the loss of activity in CD66b\u20103 was due to the nonconservative Q to R substitution, although two other amino acid substitutions are also present. These changes in primary amino acid sequence may evoke a change in secondary or tertiary structure reflected by biological activity.",

Other studies of functionally active sites of CEACAMs have also identified regions critical to activity. The N\u2010terminal half of the N\u2010domain has been shown to have a critical Opa\u2010binding epitope (52). Studies of binding of Opa proteins of N. meningiditis and N. gonorrhoeae using alanine mutagenesis have suggested that the CFG face is important in Opa binding to N\u2010domains of CEACAMs (54). In particular, Tyr34 and Ile91 are critical to Opa binding (54). Ile\u201091 is present in CD66a\u20107, CD66b\u20107, CD66c\u20107, CD66d\u20107 and CD66e\u20107. Because we were not successful in synthesizing these peptides in a soluble form, we could not test their activities in our assay. These studies also found that Tyr34, present in CD66a\u20102, CD66b\u20102, CD66c\u20102, CD66d\u20102 and CD66e\u20102, was also critical for some Opa variants, and Val39, present in CD66a\u20103, CD66b\u20103, CD66c\u20103, CD66d\u20103 and CD66e\u20103, was critical for other Opa variants. Three of these peptides, CD66a\u20102, CD66a\u20103 and CD66e\u20103, were active in our assay. Similar studies of CEACAM1 homotypic adhesion using alanine mutagenesis have also suggested that the CFG face is important in homotypic binding of CEACAM1, notably finding that Val39 in the CC\u2032 loop, contained in peptides CD66a\u20103, CD66b\u20103, CD66c\u20103, CD66d\u20103 and CD66e\u20103, is critical for homotypic adhesion (78). Recent mutagenesis studies have also suggested that the amino acid sequence NRQII, present in our peptide CD66e\u20103, is important for homotypic adhesion of CEA (79). These studies also found that 1000 \u00b5g/mL of a cyclized version of NRQII could inhibit CEA homotypic adhesion.",

The ability of the synthetic peptides described here to activate neutrophils could be mediated by alterations in CEACAM dimerization, for example by disrupting a pre\u2010existing association of CEACAM1 with other CEACAM members (including CEACAM1 itself in the form of dimers or oligomers already present on the cell surface) or by stimulating dimerization. It has been reported that CEACAM1 (83) and CEA (84) exist on the cell surface as dimers. Dimerization of CEACAMs could potentially occur via interactions between the extracellular domains of CEACAM molecules or via other mechanisms. CEACAM1 dimerization could be influenced by phosphorylation; CEACAM1 is phosphorylated on Thr453 in the calmodulin binding site by protein kinase C (2). CEACAM1 dimerization has been shown to be regulated by calmodulin and intracellular calcium in vitro (83, 85). Clearly, dimerization of CEACAMs could affect binding of other signal regulating molecules. The mechanisms by which CEACAM family members transmit signals (e.g. activation in neutrophils or growth regulating signals in epithelial cells and carcinomas) are unclear. In addition to the considerations described above, CEACAM1 is phosphorylated in neutrophils and colon cancer cells (12, 62, 63, 66), and protein kinase and phosphatase activity may associate with CEACAMs (62, 64, 65). CEACAM1 contains an immune tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM), as well as a motif similar to an immune tyrosine activating motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain (2, 62), and phosphorylation of ITAMs and ITIMs can result in binding of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, respectively, which can modify signal transduction (64, 65).",

For example, CEACAM1, CEACAM8, CEACAM6 and CEACAM3, but not CEA, are expressed on neutrophils; CEA is expressed on many tumor cells but not leukocytes; CEACAM8 is expressed on neutrophils but not epithelial cells; CEACAM6 is expressed on both neutrophils and epithelial cells (reviewed in Refs 1, 2, 4, 13). In addition, the surface expression of these molecules in other cells may also be regulated; for example, CEACAM1 expression is induced on HUVECs by \u03b3\u2010IFN (14). CEACAM members may play an important role in inflammation, as each of the CEACAM family members expressed on neutrophils are capable of transmitting activation signals, CEACAM1 is also present on T\u2010lymphocytes and a subset of NK cells (86), and CEA expression by tumor cells is correlated with resistance to NK/LAK cell mediated lysis (87, 88). It is possible that CEACAM family members could contribute to the immunosuppression often found in patients with cancer. Some bacteria bind to neutrophil CEACAMs (13, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 89, 90), and this interaction may result in signal transduction resulting in modification of neutrophil activity.
