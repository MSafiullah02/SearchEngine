Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than those who did not receive treatment in this series. Only one patient in the group had a hematological malignancy (a 47-year-old male with a diagnosis of lymphoma) and the resolution of COVID-19 without complications.5 Several concerns about this study have been made, mainly due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of diseases and therapies among patients.

There are some data from the International Myeloma Foundation.6 The Asian reports from sites in Beijing, Shanghai, Korea, Singapore and Japan (through the Japanese Myeloma Society) inform zero cases of COVID-19 in myeloma patients and no COVID-19-related deaths (reports up to March 26). On the other hand, there were more COVID-19 cases in Italy, Spain, and France, some of them resulting in death. Deaths have been reported in fragile elderly patients in end-stage myeloma. Up to March 25, 2020, two multiple myeloma patients in the US were diagnosed with COVID-19, but they are as yet the first cases.",

Triage all for respiratory symptoms before entering the facilities: it is critical to reduce the exposure to other patients and staff. The number of staff members will probably be reduced; 5. Improve viral diagnosis, even if the level of suspicion is low; 6. Provide as many viable donors as possible for blood supplies; and 7.
