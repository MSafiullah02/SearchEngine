Yet their widespread adoption in 2020 has been justified on the basis that they will reduce contagion from the COVID-19 pandemic, as they did during the 1918 influenza pandemic (Hatchett, Mecher, and Lipsitch (2007) ). The optimal lockdown policy 1 can be derived in a SIR framework as the solution to an optimal control problem in which a social planner can at any point in time reduce new infections at a cost (Alvarez, Argente, and Lippi (2020), Piguillem and Shi (2020), Hall, Jones, and Klenow (2020) , Hansen and Troy (2011), Jones, Philippon, and Venkateswaran (2020) ). It is well-known that there is a tradeoff between the fatality rate in the population and the mitigation cost on the equilibrium path. On this equilibrium path, slightly more restrictive mitigation will reduce even further the fatality rate. This notion has driven advocacy for more restrictive lockdowns.",

In this framework, I study the effect of various threshold mitigation policies in the presence of social feasibility constraints. The notion of social feasibility encompasses the notions of social acceptance and individual compliance. It varies across countries: many measures taken by China to suppress COVID-19 might not have been feasible in other countries including the US. 2 In many countries, lockdowns have faced opposition and have been characterized with widespread noncompliance when the perceived risk of infection was low. 3 Thus, effective mitigation measures can only be put in place under some conditions. To take this into account, I simply assume that there is an upper bound to the feasible level of mitigation which linearly depends on the proportion of infected individuals at a point in time: more infected individuals imply a higher risk of infection for susceptible individuals, which increases compliance and acceptance of mitigation measures, all else equal.",

To take into account the stepwise nature of actual mitigation policies, I consider threshold mitigation policies, which involve a constant mitigation level for a period of time. I consider \"one-step\", \"two-steps\", and \"three-steps\" threshold policies with one, two, and three levels of mitigation. These policies are consistent with \"lockdowns\" that were adopted by many countries in 2020 and followed by milder mitigation, and they can also generate \"rolling lockdowns\".",

            "text": "The main result is that, for a wide range of social feasibility parameters, the overall fatality rate in the population is non-monotonic in the level(s) of mitigation. Very strong mitigation only minimizes the fatality rate when social feasibility is very high, and when it is followed in a timely manner by mild mitigation. Otherwise, reducing the effective contact rate beyond a certain level increases the overall fatality rate. Whereas a permanent reduction in the effective contact rate is unequivocally beneficial (\"more infectious diseases are worse\"), a temporary reduction in the effective contact rate that will reduce the number of fatalities in the short-term may still increase the total number of fatalities. Simply put, \"erring on the side of caution\" by setting a high level of mitigation can backfire. This has important implications for the design of mitigation policies and for the assessment of the policy response to This surprising result can be explained as follows. With social feasibility constraints, mitigation measures must be lifted once the infection rate is sufficiently low. Strong mitigation measures bring down the infection rate rapidly without largely reducing the proportion of susceptible individuals. Unless strong mitigation is followed by well-calibrated mild mitigation, this reduction in the number of infected individuals puts an end to mitigation, which gets the effective reproduction number R of the disease above 1 and leads to a new spike in infections. This can result in \"stop and go\" mitigation, and in a higher overall fatality rate than lower-level mitigation. This emphasizes a so far overlooked cost of strong mitigation measures: by strongly reducing the infection rate, they can undermine the social feasibility of future mitigation and lead to a worse outcome overall.",

(2020) analyzes strategies against COVID-19, including \"mitigation\" which slows epidemic spread, and \"suppression\" which aims for very low levels of infections. They argue that suppression will require strong measures to be put in place until a vaccine is available, possibly on a \"stop and go\" basis. This paper's contribution to the burgeoning literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and to the epidemiological economics literature (Perrings et al. (2014) ) is to take into account social feasibility and its consequences for the level and duration of mitigation. This perspective may help explain why the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and health outcomes varied across countries, and why a high level of mitigation may be effective in some social contexts but not in others.",

Indeed, \"most measures for managing public health emergencies rely on public compliance for effectiveness.\" (O'Malley, Rainford, and Thompson (2009) ).

Even though the proportion of infected individuals is low at this point, the proportion of susceptible individuals is still quite high because of the preceding strong mitigation. Thus, relaxing mitigation results in additional spikes in infections which trigger additional periods of mitigation (\"stop and go\" mitigation or \"rolling lockdowns\").",

If social acceptance of mitigation policies and individual compliance are only ensured when the infection rate is high enough, then excessive mitigation can backfire by excessively decreasing the infection rate and consequently undermining the social feasibility of future mitigation. That is, even without any explicit mitigation cost, increasing the level of mitigation beyond a certain point can still be detrimental.",

The social feasibility constraints could be extended to take a more general form, for example with time-varying social feasibility parameters, a nonlinear specification, or with additional state variables besides the rate of infection in the population. The set of feasible policies could also be extended beyond threshold policies. Finally, it is an open question whether the limited scope and duration of mitigation policies are in practice primarily dictated by economic costs, by constraints on the social feasibility of mitigation policies, or by a combination of these two considerations.",

First, this condition is realistic: all else equal, social feasibility is usually a greater concern when a new policy is put in place than when it is continued. Second, this condition is without loss of generality. Indeed, with \u03b1 c \u2264 \u03b1 n , mitigation could not start when equation (7) is binding: if it did, when I(t) reaches the point when mitigation can start with a given positive value for u(t), it is also at a level such that mitigation must end because of equation (8), a contradiction. Mitigation u can only start and last when I(t) is above both u \u03b1n and u \u03b1c (see equations (7) and (8)), so that there is no loss of generality in setting \u03b1 c \u2265 \u03b1 n . Moreover, with \u03b1 c = \u03b1 n : either mitigation starts when equation (7) is binding, but then it would end at the same time as it would start, i.e., there is no mitigation; or mitigation could start when equation (7) is not binding, but this is equivalent to having \u03b1 c > \u03b1 n .",

In France, \"the first day of the national lockdown [March 17] did not go according to plan. In some big cities (notably Paris), large crowds could be seen wandering in the streets. Shoppers bustled through the streets; few wore masks or kept the one-metre distance.\" Only after the situation \"dramatically worsened\" did compliance increase. 10 This was short-lived: a few weeks after the peak in COVID-19 cases which in France was on March 31, compliance had noticeably decreased, especially in relatively spared rural areas, and almost two-thirds of French people were ready to resume normal life. 11 In California, which was relatively spared from COVID-19 infections and deaths, compliance with instructions to socially distance was low: \"shortly after [Governor] Newsom issued his directive, crowds packed beaches stretching along California's coastline (. . . ) Parks were jammed with visitors and farmers markets bustled with shoppers.\" 12 By contrast, New York state suffered a high number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities. Its population was largely compliant with mitigation measures, especially in the epicenter of the outbreak, New York city. 13 Yet, only a few weeks after mitigation measures started, and after the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths started declining, the state started facing growing social pressure to lift mitigation measures: \"local leaders [are] anxious to reopen schools and businesses. [New York state Governor Andrew] Cuomo said he knows local officials are under pressure to act.\" 14 In several countries, including the US, the UK, France, Spain, and Italy, compliance with lockdown orders diminished as lockdowns stayed in place and COVID-19 related cases and deaths declined, a phenomenon referred to as \"lockdown fatigue\". 15 In the US, where COVID-19 cases rapidly increased at the end of March and have been on a downward trend since the beginning of April, cell phone data shows that the level of social distancing at the end of April reverted to its March 20th level in many states. 16 In the UK, a few weeks after the peak on April 8 but",
