As a result of this groundbreaking international collaboration we now know that the SARS epidemic is due to a human coronavirus (HCoV) infection, now named SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several SARS-coronavirus genomes have been mapped and the functions of at least some of the proteins have been determined [1], [2]. These genomes are now available on GenBank, making it possible for laboratories around the world to begin the process of building a safe and effective SARS vaccine.",

SARS, like HIV, is a RNA virus whose replication is error-prone. Studies of 14 separate SARS strains that emerged from a single point source suggest a pattern of evolution in response to immune pressure that is much like the evolution of HIV. Some forms of coronavirus\u2014murine hepatitis virus in particular\u2014are known to mutate to escape from host immune response. Will clades and strains of SARS emerge as they have for HIV? If so, will SARS vaccine researchers be able to develop a vaccine that adequately addresses this problem? HIV vaccine developers were slow to address HIV variability; scientists involved in the SARS vaccine effort must address this issue more promptly.",

While reinfection in the case of common-cold coronavirus HCoV-229E implies either that immunity is incomplete or that antigenic variation impedes the development of immunity, the low rate of reinfection (based on available data) that has been observed with SARS and the high rate of recovery from acute illness in the absence of effective medical therapy (approximately 80% of young adults do recover) suggest that protection from disease is achievable.

The mean incubation period of SARS is estimated to be between 4 and 6 days. The case fatality rate has been as high as 15% for patients younger than 60 years and can be higher than 50% for patients aged 60 years or older. Nearly 40% of patients developed respiratory failure that requires assisted ventilation [15]. Most cases occur within 7 days of infection (in Guandong, 70 cases occurred within 7 days after a single point-exposure) [16].",

As of 26 May 2003, the WHO reported a cumulative total of 8202 probable cases with 725 deaths from 28 countries (http://www.who.int/csr/en/) (Fig. 3\n).

For example, CD4 T cell epitopes have been identified in the M and nucleocapsid proteins of MHV [32], [33], in the nucleocapsid of an avian coronavirus [34] and in TGEV of swine [35]. Persistent infection in the case of MHV seems to be due to CTL escape (mutations in the viral genomes that abrogate the ability of the cellular immune system to stimulate CTL response). Mutation occurs, even in the MHV spike protein, in response pressure from cell-mediated immune response [13]. Escape from CTL response may allow MHV to persist in the CNS [8], [9], [36]. The MHV-specific CTL response is polyclonal, but CTL escape occurs nonetheless [37], [38].",

Group 1 includes canine coronavirus (CCV), feline coronavirus (FIPV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TEGV). Group 2 species are bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) and rat coronavirus (RCV). Group 3 species are avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Turkey corona-virus (TCoV).",
