The majority of studies have been conducted on DNA and retroviruses whose primary site of replication is the nucleus, but increasingly a number of researchers are demonstrating that RNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is normally the cytoplasm, also interfere with the cell cycle. Viral interference with the cell cycle can have a myriad of different effects to improve virus infection, for example to promote replication of viral DNA genomes, or to delay the cell cycle to allow sufficient time for RNA virus assembly. Although cell cycle control is fairly well characterized in terms of checkpoints and control molecules (e.g., cyclins), in recent years several researchers have demonstrated that the nucleolus is also involved in cell cycle control. The nucleolus and associated subnuclear structures can sequester cell cycle regulatory complexes, and nucleolar proteins also have a direct and indirect effect on the cycling cell. Viruses also interact with the nucleolus. In order to study the interactions between a virus and the cell cycle and vice versa we have developed and adapted a number of different approaches and strategies. These include determinations of virus yield and measurements of virus replication to flow cytometry and confocal analysis of the host cell. Increasingly we have found that proteomic approaches allow the rapid analysis of a whole plethora of cell cycle proteins that may be affected by virus infection.",

The function of the cell cycle itself comprises a highly con-served and sequential series of checkpoints and phases ensuring that conditions are suitable for the proper function of that cell and for DNA replication and cytokinesis. There are three categories of viruses, depending on their genome and replication strategy: DNA, retro, and RNA viruses. DNA viruses employ a number of mechanisms to modify and interfere with the cell cycle regulatory machinery. In some cases viruses are adapted to multiply in resting cells, whereas in others they induce proliferation of arrested cells or just wait until the infected cell replicates.",

One has generally evolved in viruses with large genomes with the potential to encode many proteins, including those required for viral DNA replication. A typical example of this strategy is found in the herpesviruses to block cell cycle progression, preventing entry into S-phase (1). The other strategy to impinge on cell cycle control is more typical of DNA viruses with small genomes. Here, virus-encoded proteins, which are not homologs of any known cellular protein, interfere directly with the normal function of cell cycle regulatory components to subvert their activity. Typical examples are the viral oncoproteins that sequester the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein as a first step in inducing S-phase entry by activating the expression of E2F-regulated genes; for example, adenoviruses (2). Disruption of the cell cycle to favor virus replication is not confined to DNA viruses. Retroviruses also disrupt the cell cycle.",

The viral protein responsible for this has been identified as Vpr (4). Interestingly, Henklein et al. (5) demonstrated that extracellular added Vpr induced G 2 -phase arrest, and the authors suggested that free Vpr in the serum of HIV-infected patients may preprogram cells in order to facilitate replication of HIV in infected individuals. Consistent with the perturbation of the cell cycle observed in tissue culture-infected cells, lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals show high levels of cyclin B and also nucleolar proteins (whose expression is linked to the cell cycle) (6) .",

            "text": "Altering the host cell cycle by RNA viruses has not been described extensively in the literature, and the mechanisms of action are generally not well characterized. For the negative-strand RNA viruses, there are several examples of cell cycle control. For instance, measles virus infection results in a G 0 block (7), and the paramyxovirus simian virus V protein prolongs the cell cycle by delaying cells in G 1 and G 2 (8). In the case of positive-strand RNA viruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) delays cell growth by inhibiting cytokinesis and also allows cells to accumulate in S/G 2 (9, 10) . Several examples of different picornaviruses interacting with the cell cycle have been described. More recently Feuer et al. (11) have shown that cells arrested in G 1 or G 1 /S produced higher levels of infectious coxsackievirus and viral polyproteins compared with cells in the G 0 phase, or cells blocked at the G 2 /M boundary. Feuer et al. (11) suggested that persistence of coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) in vivo might be dependent on infection of G 0 cells, which do not support replication. If such cells were to reenter the cell cycle, then the virus may reactivate and trigger chronic viral or immune-mediated pathology in the host. Such findings suggest that locally delivered cell cycle inhibitors could form part of an antiviral therapy, similar to the example of interleukin-2 used to correct cell cycle aberrations in HIV-infected individuals (12).",

Cells can then be infected at different stages of the cell cycle; depending on the length of the virus life cycle virus replication can occur within a particular cell cycle stage. The second alternative is to use cell cycle inhibitors to block a particular stage of the cell cycle. This has the advantage that cells can be inhibited for prolonged lengths of time, perhaps sufficient to cover the infections cycle; it also has several disadvantages, including the fact that not all cells will arrest at the same stage 100% of the time, and cell cycle inhibitors may affect viral processes themselves.",

One of the simplest ways to measure virus replication is to use Southern (in the case of DNA viruses) and Northern (in the case of RNA viruses) blots. Overall yields of virus can be determined by plaque assay. Using an RNA virus as an example, we detail two protocols that can be used to measure RNA replication (mRNA production) and amount of virus.

Viral effects on these factors (as with any factor) should be studied both at the level of their cellular localization, which in turn can affect function, and also for analysis of expression levels in the cell. To study localization we routinely use confocal microscopy, and to study expression levels, we use flow cytometry. Microscopy has the added advantage that it can be used to check that antibodies recognize proteins of interest in both species-specific and -nonspecific cells. Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to various mammalian proteins can be crossreactive depending on the degree of conservation between the various proteins.

The methods presented here have been successfully used in our laboratory for isolation of nucleoli for subsequent proteomic analysis by 2D SDS-PAGE. This latter method can be used, in conjunction with mass spectrometry, N-terminal protein sequencing, or Western blotting, to identify proteins isolated from the nucleoli. As discussed in the Introduction, the nucleolus is targeted by many different types of virus (13, 14) , and such interactions may cause perturbations to the distribution of cell cycle factors (e.g., Fig. 4 ) and the cell cycle. 5. To wash the cell suspension, spin samples using a swingout rotor at 220g relative centrifugal force (RCF; e.g., rotor A-4-62 Eppendorf, 220g RCF, 1046 rpm), remove supernatant so that a cell pellet remains, and add a volume of 4\u00b0C PBS. Carry out this process a further two times before resuspending cells in HEPES (see Subheading 2.3., item 4 and see Note 13). 6. Transfer the cell suspension to a precooled tissue homogenizer and homogenize 10 times using a tight-fitting pestle (0.0010-0.0030-inch clearance), while keeping the homogenizer on ice. The number of strokes needed depends on the cell type used, so it is necessary to examine the homogenized cells with a phase contrast microscope after every 10 strokes. Stop when >90% of the cells have burst, leaving intact nuclei. 7. To obtain a pellet containing enriched nuclei, centrifuge the homogenized cells again at 220g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. 8. Resuspend the pellet with a volume S1 solution by pipeting up and down. In another tube containing a volume of S2, layer onto the top the resuspended pellet; ensure that the two layers remain cleanly separated. 9. Centrifuge this cushion at 1430g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to obtain a purer nuclear pellet. Following this spin, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in a volume of S2 solution by pipeting up and down. 10. Appropriate sonication on ice is a crucial stage in the preparation of nucleoli (see Note 14). 11. To prepare a nucleolar concentrated pellet, layer the sonicated material over a volume of S3 solution and centrifuge at 3000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. 12. Further purification of nucleoli can be carried out by re-suspending the pellet with S2 solution, and centrifuging at 1430g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting pellet contains highly purified nucleoli, which can be examined by microscopy and, if required, stored at -80\u00b0C.",

Each strip can then be transferred to the corresponding channel in the focusing tray, gel side down, with the positive end of the strip adjacent to the positive electrode of the tray, in contact with the wetted electrodes. 3. Each of the strips should again be covered with 2-3 mL of fresh mineral oil. 4. The focusing tray can now be placed into the protean IEF cell (Bio-Rad, UK) with the positive side of the tray corresponding to the positive electrode of the cell. 5. Once the cell cover has been closed, the IEF cell can be programmed (see Bio-Rad Protean IEF cell instructions) for a single-or multiple-step focusing protocol. In our laboratory a three-step protocol has proved satisfactory for IEF of nucleolar proteins. Our program follows the basic format of:",

For determining whether proteins have isoelectrically focused correctly, it is possible to transfer IPG strips to a clean, dry piece of blotting filter paper with the gel side up, thoroughly wet a second filter paper of the same size with pure water, and carefully lay the wet filter paper onto the IPG strips. Then \"peel\" back the top filter paper. This blotting step removes mineral oil on the surface of the IPG. 2. The IPG strips can then be stained for protein using 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue solution (1 h) and then destained with destain buffer until proteins are revealed (1-3 h; see Subheading 2.4.). Alternatively, strips can be stained with Bio-Rad's IEF stain (Bio-Rad, UK).",

When conducting RNA work, ensure that all liquid dispensers (i.e., Gilson pipets or equivalents) are wiped with 75% ethanol, and wear suitable gloves. Be sure not to touch any part of exposed skin (i.e., your face) with the gloves; this is a bad habit that many laboratory workers have. Many people secrete DNase and RNases. 5. It is advisable to use as thin a gel as possible; the thinner the gel, the faster and more efficient the transfer of RNA to membrane. 6. Running agarose gels for Northern blot analysis at high voltages can result in gel warping owing to heat. It is advisable to run the gel overnight at low voltages to minimize temperatures, and it is advantageous to use a buffer recirculation pump. 7. Touch the nylon membrane as little as possible to prevent nuclease contamination. 8. Once they are crosslinked, membranes can be stored at -20\u00b0C for several months. 9. Unlike isotopic 32 P-labeled probes, placing the film cassette containing the membrane exposed to film at -80\u00b0C will not increase the signal of weak RNA-labeled species. 10. Every 15 min, gently agitate the plates to ensure that the Vero cells are fully overlaid with innoculum to prevent cell desiccation. 11. Ensure that the agarose is fully equilibrated to 42\u00b0C before addition to the media. Addition of agarose solution at temperatures higher than 42\u00b0C can damage the cells. 12. Virus titer can vary depending on the cell type used. 13. It is good practice to ensure that cells have not lysed but have become swollen in the buffer conditions by examining with an inverted microscope. Extra care should be taken when working with mammalian cells, as these are particularly prone to lysis at 37\u00b0C in hypotonic conditions; therefore preparation on ice is imperative. 14. With most cell preparations, sonication of the nuclear suspension for six 10-s bursts (with 10-s intervals between each burst) has proved sufficient in our hands. In our laboratory we use a Misonix XL 2020 sonicator fitted with a microtip probe set at a power setting of 5. The optimal sonication conditions do, however, depend on the cell types used; oversonication leads to destruction of nucleoli, whereas undersonication leaves the sub- Fig. 7 .

For best results, examine the suspension by microscopy after each round of sonication; there should be virtually no intact cells, and the nucleoli should be seen as dense, refractive bodies. ",

Cover slips are rinsed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 1 mL 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature (RT). 4. The solution is then removed and the cover slips rinsed twice with PBS followed by blocking for 1 h at RT with 4% BSA in PBS. 5. The blocking solution is removed, and rabbit polyclonal anticaspase 8 P-20 (cat. no. H-134, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in blocking solution (4% BSA in PBS) is incubated for 4 h at RT. 6. Excess antibody should be removed and the cover slips rinsed twice with PBS before incubating in PBS for 30 min at RT. 7. Secondary FITC-conjugated antirabbit antibody (Sigma) diluted (1:100) in PBS is then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. 8. Excess antibody is removed by washing the cover slips in 2 mL PBS three times for 10 min each prior to mounting the cover slips on microscope slides using mounting media containing DAPI (Vector).9. Mounted coverslips can be analyzed using an Axiovision system (Carl Zeiss Jena). Pictures are captured with an Axiocam camera and processed using the Axiovision 3.0 software provided (Carl Zeiss Jena).",

For flow cytometry of caspase 8 expression, Vero cells either treated with 100 mM Etoposide for 48 h for transfected for 24 h (either with pTriEx 1.1 [Novagen] or pTriEx IBVNHis) are harvested by detaching the cells with 2 mL PBS/EDTA/trypsin and transferring them into canonical tubes containing 8 mL 10% DMEM. 2. The supernatant containing detached cells is transferred to canonical centrifuge tubes instead of being discarded. 3. In both cases cells are spun at 250g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the cell pellets resuspended in 2 mL ice-cold PBS. 4. Prior centrifugation, both populations are pooled, and the pooled cells are then pelleted by centrifugation at 250g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. 5. The supernatant is removed, and the cells are resuspended in 70% precooled (-20\u00b0C) methanol and incubated for at least 12 h at -20\u00b0C. 6. To detect intracellular caspase 8, cells are centrifuged at 250g for 10 min/4\u00b0C to remove methanol and washed once with 2 mL ice-cold PBS. 7. Cells are then resuspended in 875 \u03bcL of ice-cold PBS and fixed by the addition of 175 \u03bcL of ice-cold PBS with 2% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. 8. Fixative can be removed by centrifugation for 5 min (250g, 4\u00b0C) and the supernatant aspirated. 9. Cells are permeabilized by resuspending them in 1 mL of PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 for 15 min at 37\u00b0C; then they are washed with 1 mL of PBS and centrifuged for 8 min at 250g at 4\u00b0C. 10.

Vero cells were transfected with pTriExIBVNHis (a construct that expresses the nucleoprotein under the control of a PolII promoter), treated with 100 mM etoposide, or left untreated and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for the localization of caspse 8 using a polyclonal anticaspase 8 (P 20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transfected cells were analyzed 24 h post transfection, whereas etoposide-treated cells were analyzed 48 h post treatment. In nontreated cells (left row) caspase 8 can be detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, in cells transfected with IBVN His (middle row), caspase 8 is localised in the cyto-and nucleoplasm with a prominent signal in the perinuclear region and the nucleolus. In Etoposide treated cells (right row) caspse 8 is almost exclusively localised in the nucleus and the perinuclear region. Primary caspase 8 antibody was detected with FITCconjugated goat antirabbit antibody (Sigma), and IBV NHis was detected with mouse anti-His (C-term; Sigma) antibody as primary antibodies and Texas red-conjugated goat anti mouse (Harlan Sera Lab) as secondary antibody.",
