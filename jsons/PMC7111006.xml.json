DNA fragments covering different regions of the S gene were amplified from the viral cDNA with primers at the proper sites. Fig. 1\nshowed a schematic diagram indicating the sizes and the locations of these fragments on S gene. The recombinant S fragments (SR1, SR2, and SR3) were constructed by joining of short S fragments through overlapping extensions. The cloning sites, BamHI and EcoRI, start and stop codons were incorporated into PCR fragments by synthesizing on primers when necessary. A Kozak sequence was also added to SNa and SLa ahead of their signal sequence. An expression vector, pCI-SPpGH, was reconstructed by adding 28 amino acid residues of pig growth hormone signal peptide sequence (SPpGH) [27] at upstream of modified polyclone sites of pCI (Promega). All the PCR amplified fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced as described [26] before they were cloned into pCI-SPpGH, except SNa and SLa, which possessed the signal sequence of S gene and hence were inserted to pCI. The fragments SNb, SLb, SC, SF, SR1, SR2, and SR3 were also cloned into another expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) without signal sequence. Plasmid DNA used to immunize animals was prepared by Plasmid giga kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

The vector was modified by adding the 6\u00d7His and IRES-GFP up- and downstream of the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA3.1(+), respectively. IRES-GFP was PCR amplified from the plasmid pBMN-I-GFP, which was a kind gift from Dr. G.P. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine). The recombinant plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells cultured in 96-well microtiter plate in triplicate with DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The expression was examined by direct observation using fluorescence microscopy. The expression of several selected fragments was further confirmed by Western blot. The transfected COS-7 cells were harvested in 48\u201372 h post-transfection (p.t.).

The recombinant S fragments were constructed by joining the various hydrophilic regions of S protein (Fig. 1), in an attempt to highly express the possible neutralizing epitopes on the exposing surface of S protein. All of the fragments were inserted in pcDNA3.1-6\u00d7His-IRES-GFP, including the full-length S gene, and expressed in COS-7 cells, as demonstrated by the observed fluorescence in the transfected cells (data not shown). In such expression system, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was encoded by the same mRNA encoding S gene fragment under the control of CMV promoter, but translated in two independent open reading frames (ORF). Although the number of fluorescence emitting cells and the density of fluorescence were different among various S fragments transfected cells, it was difficult to establish a connection between GFP expression and antibody titers since the antibody response was not merely influenced by or directly related to the expression of antigen. In addition, the expression of S protein was also confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2\n), and the expression of different S fragments in pcDNA 3.1-6\u00d7His-IRES-GFP was detected with expected size. However, we failed to detect the expression of SF and other two small fragments, S1\u20131 and S1\u20132, in the same experiment although their expression was proven at mRNA level through GFP co-expression.",

The SARS-CoV specific antibodies of the grouped sera were detected by ELISA and the humoral response profile of the seroconverted groups is shown in Fig. 3\n. The individual sera in possible seroconverted groups were titrated and are summarized in Table 1\n. In general, both S1 and S2 could elicit SARS-CoV specific antibodies. The immunogenic importance of the N-terminus of S1 subunit was revealed by comparing the SARS-CoV specific antibody titer of mouse groups immunized with plasmids containing SNa, SNb, and SNc. These three fragments shared a common region of residues 27\u2013495, but different only in their N-terminus (Fig. 1). A higher antibody titer and more seroconverted individuals were observed in SNb group than that of the SNa group. The SNc group, however, showed no detectable SARS-CoV specific antibody response (Table 1), although it had the same leader sequence and most of the S1 amino acid residues as SNb. Another series of constructs, SLa, SLb, and SLc, showed a similar trend of antibody responses against SARS-CoV (Table 1). Groups immunized with pCI-SPpGH containing SF, S1\u20131, and S1\u20132, however, showed no detectable antibody response against the virus, while SC, SR1, SR2, and SR3 groups showed a relatively low humoral response (Table 1). It was also noted that the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1 (without signal peptide) containing the fragments SNb, SLb, SC, SF, SR1, SR2, and SR3 showed no detectable antibody response (data not shown) although their expression was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2).",

Co-administration of an additional non-secreting SLb to both groups induced a higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in both groups (Table 1), although such non-secreting form of S protein seemed to have a negative effect on antibody elicitation, as a lower group\u2019s titer and a fewer number of seroconverted mice were observed in group SLa/+ and SNa/+.",

            "text": "In the present study, different truncated fragments of SARS-CoV S gene were cloned into two mammalian expression vectors, with or without secreting signal sequence, and used to immunize mice. The non-secreting form of S protein could not elicit any detectable SARS-CoV specific antibody response while the secreting forms S1, S2, and the N-terminus of S1 (SN) did. The inability of the non-secreting S protein to elicit SARS-CoV specific antibody may be explained by the lack of expressed antigens with correct conformation exposed to immune system for post-translational modification including complex folding, glycosylation, and oligomerization, which occurs during protein secretion and sorting. It was widely reported that the expression of viral membrane protein in different cellular locations (e.g., secreted, membrane bound, and non-secreted form) was the immune response of DNA immunization. Animals vaccinated with DNA encoding secreting form of E2 glycoprotein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) showed both CSFV specific antibody response and protection upon viral challenge though the native E2 was anchor membrane protein ([28], [29] and Zeng et al., unpublished data). In addition, a shift in T-helper cell response from Th1 to Th2 was induced by expression of secreting form of hemagglutinin glycoproteins [30]. The non-secreting form of S protein, however, might be useful in activation of Th1 response, as injection of secreting and non-secreting S1 into the same mouse enhanced Th1 response, as shown by the raised IgG2a to IgG1 ratio (Table 1). These preliminary data suggest that S1 may possess epitopes that could activate T-cell responses.",

            "text": "The obligatory cooperation of S1 and S2 specific antibodies in terms of virus neutralization, however, contradicts with previous researches on coronavirus. Several authors reported that immunization with recombinant S1 protein or plasmid encoding the S1 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) could induce protective immune responses [8], [12], [13], although multiple inoculations were required [9]. The first paper on immunizing masques with structural genes of SARS-CoV, however, reported that co-delivery of three viral genes encoding S1, nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) protein could elicit a high titer of neutralizing antibody and T-cell response [24]. The authors stated that inoculation of S1 with N and or M could stimulate a strong antibody and T-cell response, in parallel with the previous experience on developing vaccine against transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) [31]. From this, together with the experimental data from this report, it can be hypothesized that antibodies against the S1 glycoprotein are crucial in neutralizing SARS-CoV but the antibodies against other components of the virus may also play critical roles in virus neutralization. Such effects may become significant if the titer of the antibodies, including those against S1 protein, is low. The putative cooperative role of S2 specific polyclonal antibody to neutralize the virus may serve as an additional example which directly demonstrates the blockage of virus entry through the binding to the S2 subunit. Further experiments are desirable to define the exact roles S1 and S2 specific polyclonal antibodies play in neutralizing SARS-CoV and their protecting ability against virus challenge. Results described here are expected to speed up the design of subunit vaccine and the immunological research against the SARS-CoV.",
