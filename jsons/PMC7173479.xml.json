Congenital defects (nasal septal deviations, choanal atresia, subepiglottic cysts, and hypoplastic lungs) are typically evident at birth, whereas other conditions, such as chronic bacterial pneumonia (Rhodococcus equi), may not be evident until the foal is older (1 to 3 months of age). Viral and bacterial upper respiratory tract infections tend to occur in the weanling and yearling, whereas conditions such as inflammatory airway disease, pleuropneumonia, or exercise-induced epistaxis are found more commonly in performance horses 2 years or older. In contrast, recurrent airway disease (heaves) or neoplasia of the respiratory tract are diagnosed primarily in the middle-aged or older horse.",

For example, one should evaluate Arabian foals with chronic infections for combined immunodeficiency syndrome, a heritable condition in which cell-mediated and humoral limbs of the immune system are deficient. In addition, solitary defects in the humoral immune system also predispose horses to develop chronic respiratory and enteric infections. Selective immunoglobulin M (IgM) deficiency tends to occur more frequently in Arabians and Quarter Horses, whereas agammaglobulinemia has been documented in Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds.1, 2\n",

For example, is the horse stabled at a racetrack where population turnover is high and the potential for viral respiratory outbreaks is increased, or is the horse a sole inhabitant of a small pasture, seldom exposed to other horses? Does the farm have a history of endemic infections, as often occur with Streptococcus equi outbreaks? Has the horse been exposed to pastures grazed by donkeys? This, along with information regarding the diet (hay, pelleted rations, or pasture), the nature of the bedding materials (straw, peat, or shavings), and the amount of time the horse is stabled are important considerations in establishing the risk factors for some respiratory disorders such as recurrent airway obstruction or lungworm infections. One also should obtain the deworming and vaccination schedules. Young horses are at risk for developing verminous pneumonia resulting from Parascaris equorum migration. Nematode eggs can survive for prolonged periods on a pasture. Thus establishing whether the foal was exposed to pastures grazed by yearlings or 2-year-olds may help in establishing the diagnosis and treating the problems. If the horse is a performance animal and is at an increased risk for developing upper respiratory tract infections, one should determine how frequently equine influenza and equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV1) and type 4 (EHV4) vaccinations are administered.",

            "text": "The clinician should examine the horse during eupneic and hyperpneic (by use of a rebreathing bag) breathing patterns. Normal breath sounds are those produced by turbulent air movement through the tracheobronchial tree and vary in intensity and quality depending on the portion of the lung field auscultated. The vesicular sounds, over the middle and diaphragmatic lung lobes, are the quietest sounds; the bronchial sounds, over the trachea and the base of the lung, are the loudest.4, 5, 6 In the normal horse one can hear breath sounds more easily on the right side than on the left. Considerable variation exists between normal patients in the intensity of the breath sounds. For example, vesicular sounds are often barely audible during eupneic (normal) breathing in the obese patient and are perceived as soft rustling sounds. However, one may hear breath sounds easily in the thin or young animal because of less attenuation of lung sounds by the chest wall. The intensity of breath sounds also increases with increased airflow. Thus breath sounds are accentuated in febrile or excited animals or in animals hyperpneic from a variety of causes (exercise, hypoxia, pain). However, auscultatory findings do not always correlate well with the degree of alveolar ventilation.5 For example, in horses with lung consolidation the transmission of breath sounds from adjacent areas gives the false impression that that region is well ventilated. Breath sounds also may become more difficult to hear in cases of (1) alveolar overinflation in which the aerated tissue of the lung is a poor conduction medium of sound or (2) pneumothorax and pleural effusions in which the sound is reflected at the pleural surface (acoustic impedance).5\n",

Crackles are short, explosive, discontinuous sounds that have been likened to the sound of salt thrown in a hot frying pan or the sound of cellophane being crumpled. They are usually of low intensity and are audible during the inspiratory phase of respiration. Their production has been attributed to the sudden equalization of pressure in two compartments after airways have reopened. Crackles are audible in cases of interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary edema (restrictive pulmonary diseases) and in cases of bronchopneumonia or airway diseases (obstructive disorders). Breathing 100% oxygen also may produce crackles because the nitrogen stent maintaining alveolar distention is eliminated.7 Crackles are also audible in cases of subcutaneous emphysema. Wheezes are musical sounds thought to arise from the vibration of airway walls or tissue masses in close contact with the airway walls and may be audible during inspiration or expiration. Wheezes may be monophonic or polyphonic, the latter indicative of multiple sites of airway obstruction. Pleuritic friction rubs have been described as sandpaper-like sounds generated by the movement of the visceral and parietal pleurae across each other. One may detect them (infrequently) in the early stages of \u201cdry\u201d pleuritis, before the effusive stage.",

Aerated tissues produce a resonant sound, whereas fluid-filled structures (bowel, heart, lung abscesses, consolidated lung) produce a dull sound. One should identify the transitional site where sound quality changes during percussion by using a piece of tape. One then compares the limits of the percussed field with those of the normal horse. The cranial limit is the shoulder musculature, the dorsal limit is the back musculature, and the caudoventral limits are the seventeenth intercostal space at the level of the tuber coxae, the sixteenth intercostal space at the level of the tuber ischii, the thirteenth intercostal space at the midthorax, the eleventh intercostal space at the level of the scapulohumeral articulation, and the sixth intercostal space at the olecranon.8 Thoracic percussion should not be painful: resentment by the horse may indicate pleuritis or rib fractures. A ventral dullness suggests pleural effusion, pleural thickening, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. Occasionally, caudal borders may be expanded, suggesting alveolar overinflation, which may accompany recurrent airway disease.",

Endoscopy is helpful in establishing (1) the origin of respiratory noises that accompany laryngeal hemiplegia, dorsal displacement of the soft palate, epiglottic entrapment, rostral displacement of the palatopharyngeal arches, arytenoid chondritis, tracheal collapse or stenosis, and pharyngeal narrowing; (2) the existence of congenital defects such as subepiglottic cysts, cleft palate, or choanal atresia; (3) the source of exudate or hemorrhage occurring with guttural pouch mycosis or empyema, ethmoidal hematoma, pulmonary epistaxis, retropharyngeal abscessation, and chronic pulmonary disease; and (4) in extracting foreign bodies from the tracheobronchial tree. Videoendoscopic examination of the upper respiratory tract during maximal treadmill exercise (12 to 14 m/sec) is a routine diagnostic modality at many referral centers, allowing visualization of dynamic collapse of the upper airway structures during exercise in certain pathologic conditions. Accumulations of mucopurulent exudate within the pharynx or the trachea following exercise are compatible with a diagnosis of inflammatory airway disease. Endoscopy is a potential means of obtaining tracheobronchial aspirates (guarded swabs or catheters).9 A number of different fiberoptic endoscope models are available but an 11-mm (outer diameter) endoscope usually is used in adult horses, and a smaller, 7.8-mm (outer diameter) pediatric scope is recommended for foals.",

One can access the caudal maxillary sinus at a point 2 cm rostral to the midpoint of a perpendicular line drawn from the medial canthus of the eye to the facial crest. One can access the rostral maxillary sinus 2 cm caudal to the midpoint of a line drawn from the rostral end of the facial crest to the infraorbital foramen. The frontoconchal sinus is accessible through a portal placed 40% of the distance of a perpendicular line drawn from 0.5 cm caudal to the medial canthus from the midline. The frontoconchal site affords excellent visualization of the frontoconchal sinus and, via the large frontomaxillary opening, the caudal maxillary sinus. Following sedation of the horse and surgical preparation and local anesthesia of the selected site, the clinician makes a small skin incision and opens the bone with either a \u00bc-inch Steinman pin (for a 4-mm diameter arthroscope) or a 10-mm trephine (for a 9-mm endosocope). The endoscope provides better illumination and a greater field of view. In addition to direct examination of the sinus interior for diagnosis (Figure 7-1\n), sinuscopy allows the examiner to biopsy tissues under direct visualization and to apply therapeutic procedures such as formalin injection of mass lesions (Figure 7-2\n), cyst removal, and removal of sequestered bone fragments. Following examination, the clinician may close the portal with cutaneous sutures or leave it open for therapeutic lavage.",

Table 7-1\nshows representative cytologic findings from bronchoalveolar lavage studies of normal horses. Sedation of horses before bronchoalveolar lavage is recommended. Using a fiberoptic endoscope (permitting direct visualization of the lung segment to be lavaged) or using a thick-walled flexible tube with a cuffed end (which is passed blindly into the distal airways), the clinician instills 100 to 500 ml of physiologic saline solution within the pulmonary segment.

For a microorganism to be implicated in a lower airway disorder, one would expect (1) to obtain a moderate to heavy growth of the organism on culture (\u22651 \u00d7 103 colony-forming units); (2) to identify organisms within phagocytic cells; and (3) to have evidence of degenerative neutrophils. In contrast, anaerobes, which are a normal component of the oropharyngeal flora, normally are not isolated from aspirates of healthy horses, emphasizing their importance in diseased processes when recovered from respiratory cases. Based on their studies, Sweeney, Beech, and Roby24 also have described a group of transient bacterial flora of questionable pathogenicity such as Enterobacter, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci (except for Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which may be isolated from tracheobronchial aspirates.

One may perform the technique easily at the sixth or seventh intercostal space approximately 10 cm dorsal to the olecranon by aseptically inserting a teat cannula through an anesthetized site in the intercostal space, just cranial to the border of the rib. To reduce the amount of air aspirated into the pleural cavity, one attaches a three-way stopcock to the cannula.

Using \u03b3-emitting radioisotopes such as krypton-81m or technetium-99m, the clinician can assess pulmonary ventilation and perfusion in the horse.36, 37 The horse, breathing through a closed circuit, inhales aerosolized technetium particles generated by a nebulizer. Aerosolized particles are of sufficiently small diameter to be deposited in the alveoli and small airways. Thus their distribution mirrors ventilation. A gamma camera records the sites of deposition within the lung fields. For the perfusion scan, one injects technetium-labeled macroaggregated albumin intravenously. The large protein particles lodge in the blood capillaries of the lung, enabling imaging of the pulmonary perfusion by the gamma camera. Hence lung scintigraphy permits evaluation of the ratio of regional ventilation to perfusion (/) not possible by radiography or ultrasonography. Scintigraphic images may provide additional insights into the diagnosis and pathogenesis of such disorders as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) or in the evaluation of the horse with poor performance.38, 39 For example, horses with EIPH appears to have a perfusion deficit in the caudodorsal lung lobe that results in a high V/Q area.38 Horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may produce several patterns, including V/Q deficits in the costophrenic angle (caudoventral diaphragmatic margin), ventilation deficits in the middorsal lung area, or patterns similar to those seen in EIPH.40 In addition to assessment of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, scintigraphy can show tracheal mucus transport after intratracheal injection of technetium. One performs the technique by timing the movement of the radioactive bolus over a given tracheal distance.41, 42 Normal values for the unsedated horse range from 16.6 to 20.7 mm/min. Further studies are needed to examine alterations in tracheal mucus transport during disease. For further information, the reader is referred to additional reviews.40\n",

Pulmonary function testing requires that the horse wear a breathing apparatus to which an airflow meter has been attached. Pleural pressure changes occurring during each breath are estimated by catheters placed in the midesophagus, exteriorized through the nares, and attached to pressure transducers. By integrating airflow relative to time, one obtains the inspiratory and expiratory volumes. Additional parameters obtained from measurements of airflow include inspiratory and expiratory times, breathing frequency, and peak airflows. In general, the simple measurement of tidal volume, breathing frequency, or minute volume (the product of tidal volume and breathing frequency) provides limited information regarding the functionality of the lung, because these values tend to be maintained near normal limits until the respiratory disease is advanced.43\n",

One measures dynamic compliance (Cdyn) by dividing the tidal volume by the change in pleural pressure occurring between the start and end of inhalation. One measures pulmonary resistance by several different techniques, depending on whether one measures the resistance at peak airflow or at specific ventilatory volumes (e.g., 50% tidal volume), and calculates it by dividing airflow by the change in pleural (esophageal) pressure. Alterations in these two values can provide information on the nature of the lung disorder. For example, in obstructive disorders of the tracheobronchial tree, dynamic compliance decreases and pulmonary resistance increases. A decrease in dynamic compliance in the absence of a change in pulmonary resistance suggests that the lung parenchyma has been stiffened by alveolar disease or by obstruction of the peripheral bronchioles. (One may recall that peripheral bronchioles, because of their immense cross-sectional area, contribute little to the resistance of breathing until the disorder is well advanced.) Conversely, an increase in pulmonary resistance in the absence of a change in dynamic compliance suggests that the obstruction exists in the upper airway, trachea, or bronchus.44\n",

As might be predicted, the dosage to achieve this in a horse with inflammatory airway disease or recurrent airway disease is much smaller than that needed to achieve a similar effect in a healthy horse.

This visualization confirms that the exudate originates from the sinus compartment. One may further define the sinus disorder by sinuscopy or computed tomography scan. The clinician always should conduct a thorough oral examination of the upper dental arcade even if it requires short-acting anesthesia. The presence of fractured or displaced teeth, receding gum lines, exudate around a specific tooth, or patent infundibula suggests that dental disease is the cause of the disorder. Lateral and dorsoventral radiographs are helpful in diagnosing sinusitis and may demonstrate single or multiple horizontal fluid-air interfaces, abnormalities of the teeth, lysis of alveolar bone, or a combination of these (Figure 7-6, Figure 7-7\n). Nuclear scintigraphy may indicate increased uptake of radioisotope around an infected tooth root.61 Neoplastic lesions may be visible radiographically as loculated or diffuse soft tissue densities. Culture and cytologic examination of the sinus fluid or biopsy of the tissue mass is helpful in the diagnosis, although differentiating between a neoplastic or dysplastic process or inflammatory reaction may be difficult. Tumors may vary in consistency but usually have gelatinous areas mixed with combinations of cysts and solid tissue (fibrous tissue).62\n",

This finding may be associated with pharyngeal paralysis of numerous causes, but in the absence of signs of dysphagia, the condition often is caused by mechanical or inflammatory mechanisms that obliterate the subepiglottic space (subepiglottic cyst, epiglottitis, epiglottic entrapment, subepiglottic fibrosis, etc.). In most cases of DDSP, palate position is normal on resting and displacement occurs only during strenuous exercise. The cause of displacement in such cases is unclear. Formerly suggested mechanisms including excessively negative intrapharyngeal pressures,96 excessive poll flexion,97 epiglottic shortening,98 and caudal retraction of the larynx by the sternothyrohyoideus94 now appear largely unfounded. Recent studies have focused on palatal innervation and on factors controlling the relative positions of the larynx and hyoid apparatus as potential causes of palate displacement. Bilateral blockade of the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve with local anesthetic has been shown to cause DDSP, implicating a dysfunction of the palate musculature or its innervation as the cause.99 Furthermore, the observation that some horses with displacement have lymphadenopathy of retropharyngeal nodes that lie in close proximity to the pharyngeal nerves supports the hypothesis that a neuropathy is contributory.100 Other investigators have evaluated the effects of altering the relationships between the larynx and hyoid apparatus through denervation or transection of various muscles inserting on those structures. Selective transection of the thyrohyoideus muscle causes intermittent dorsal displacement of the palate in some horses, leading to speculation that neuromuscular disorders of this muscle may predispose to displacement.101 Recent observations that DDSP and nasopharyngeal collapse were observed in horses following desensitization of the laryngeal mucosa with local anesthetic suggests that receptors within the laryngeal mucosa may be important in maintaining upper airway patency in exercising horses.102\n",

The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is the longest nerve in the horse and typically the only one in which axonopathy leads to a clinically evident deficit.

The slap test has been used to evaluate the adductor function of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. In normal horses, when one slaps the saddle area of the horse, contralateral arytenoid cartilage adduction occurs. This adduction is detectable endoscopically or by palpation of the larynx during the procedure. The reflex is absent in horses with idiopathic recurrent laryngeal neuropathy.135 However, the demonstration of a normal laryngeal reflex when the horse is at rest does not indicate that the horse is completely free of laryngeal hemiplegia.126 Ultimately, the clinician usually makes the diagnosis by an endoscopic examination wherein one observes asymmetric positioning or range of motion of the arytenoid cartilages and relaxation of the vocal folds on the affected side. Box 7-3\nprovides a proposed grading scheme and may aid in the decision for surgical intervention. For example, horses with grade IV can be expected to benefit from surgery, whereas horses with grades I and II usually are not compromised during exercise and thus are not good surgical candidates. Horses with grade III are considered suspect, some of these horses demonstrating dynamic collapse of the airway and thus requiring surgical intervention. Ideally, one should perform endoscopic examination of the horse during treadmill exercise to ascertain the importance of slight asymmetry at rest in the production of exercise intolerance. A recent study documented progression of laryngeal hemiplegia, as judged by clinical signs and endoscopic examination, in 15% of horses.136 The mean age of onset of progression was 7 years.",

Prosthetic laryngoplasty prevents the increase in inspiratory resistance and flow limitation during moderate exercise.132 However, ventriculectomy alone fails to alleviate the increased inspiratory impedance during exercise.133 Surgical procedures that attempt to restore innervation to the cricoartyenoideus dorsalis muscle minimize the risk of serious postoperative complications. Described techniques include transplantation of a nerve-muscle pedicle into the cricoartenoidus dorsalis muscle, implantation of the cut end of the second cervical nerve into the left cricoarytenoideus muscle and anastomosis of the first cervical nerve to the abductor branch of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.137, 138, 139 A modest improvement was notable in the experimental models but a report of nerve-muscle pedicle graft in racehorses revealed results comparable to those of prosthetic laryngoplasty.140 Reinnervation of the cricoarytenoideus muscle following nerve-muscle pedicle grafting takes 6 to 12 months depending on the amount of muscle atrophy and thus is used primarily in young, unraced horses or in horses in which a rapid return to athletic performance is not necessary.",

This protein functions by limiting deposition of complement components (C3b) on the bacterial surface and preventing activation of the alternative complement pathway. SeM also binds fibrinogen and impairs neutrophil killing of the organism.142 The M-like antigen also appears to be important for adherence of the organism to the oropharyngeal epithelium.

One should isolate the horses during their treatment protocol.3.For horses exhibiting evidence of lymph node abscessation, administration of penicillin slows the progression of lymph node abscessation and generally is contraindicated. Hot-packing the area(s) promotes abscess formation. Once achieved, the clinician should lance the abscess and flush it with a 2% tamed iodine solution. One should treat horses in isolation.4.For horses that are systemically ill or that develop complications such as dysphagia and respiratory distress require supportive care in addition to high levels of intravenous penicillin. This therapy may entail intravenous fluid therapy, a tracheostomy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and feeding via the nasogastric tube.\n",

            "text": "Complications most frequently result from metastasis of the organism to other organ systems with the formation of purulent foci.165 These complications include the following:1.Internal abscessation of the mesentery or of parenchymatous organs. The causes of internal abscessation are not known, although inadequate antimicrobial therapy during respiratory catarrh and lymphoid abscessation may be contributory.166 The horse may have a history of intermittent colic, periodic pyrexia, anorexia, depression, and weight loss. The clinician should direct diagnostic techniques, including rectal palpation, thoracic radiography, thoracocentesis, abdominocentesis, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and nuclear scintigraphy,167 at determining the location of the abscess. Cases of internal abscessation can be difficult to differentiate from neoplastic causes of weight loss and colic because both processes may induce similar abnormalities in the peritoneal fluid (leukocytosis and hyperproteinemia). Differentiation between the two processes may not be possible unless exfoliated neoplastic cells are identified.168 Hematologic and serum biochemical abnormalities in cases of internal abscessation include (1) a neutrophilic and monocytic leukocytosis, (2) hyperfibrinogenemia, (3) hyperglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia, and (4) hypocalcemia.166, 168 However, these changes are not unique to abscesses and may not be found in horses with intraabdominal neoplasms.168 Thus the diagnosis of internal abscessation represents a medical challenge. Once one confirms the diagnosis, long-term penicillin therapy is indicated and may be required for several months. Clinical signs, rectal palpation, repeated abdominocentesis, and multiple complete blood counts (CBCs) are useful to monitor the progress of therapy.2.Purpura hemorrhagica. This aseptic vasculitis occurs following reexposure to S. equi by natural infection or following vaccination. In horses with purpura hemorrhagica, IgA titers to the SeM and to nonspecific proteins in the S. equi culture supernatant (SC-P) are significantly greater than those titers found in horses with uncomplicated strangles.169 Furthermore, the isolation of immune complexes consisting of IgA and M-like proteins in the sera of horses with purpura hemorrhagica has led to the suggestion that this isotype is involved in the development of purpura.169, 170 The immunologic basis for the increase in serum IgA levels is not known: possible explanations include uncontrolled expansion of B cell populations that produce IgA against antigens of S. equi or failure of IgA removal mechanisms because of hepatic dysfunction. In the horse, purpura hemorrhagica has been likened to Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, an immune complex\u2013mediated disease of human beings.170\nThe clinical signs of purpura vary and range from a mild transient reaction to a severe and fatal form. Horses with purpura develop pitting edema of the limbs, head, and trunk and petechiation and ecchymoses of the mucous membranes. Horses also may have colic following edema and hemorrhage of the bowel. The vasculitis may cause skin sloughing and infarcts of skeletal muscle. Death may ensue as a result of pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, or gastrointestinal disorders.Confirmation of diagnosis is by skin biopsy characterized as a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, isolation of the organism, or demonstration of elevated IgA titers to S. equi. Treatment entails administration of intravenous penicillin (20,000 IU/kg 4 times daily), dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly), intravenous fluids, and antiinflammatory drugs. Clinical recovery occurs as the source of the antigen is removed and as the immune response is suppressed. Coincidental with recovery is the production of IgG to S. equi antigens.169\n3.Guttural pouch empyema and chondroid formation (see the previous discussion).4.Septicemia and the development of infectious arthritis, pneumonia, and encephalitis. These conditions warrant a poor prognosis.171\n5.Retropharyngeal abscessation. Upper respiratory tract obstruction may cause the horse to develop respiratory distress and dysphagia. Endoscopy of the nasopharynx demonstrates collapse of the nasopharynx, deviation of the larynx, or drainage of purulent material into the nasopharynx when external pressure is applied to the parotid region.172 Radiographs demonstrate a soft tissue density in the retropharyngeal area, thickening of the roof of the pharynx, reduction in the diameter of the pharyngeal airway, and distortion or compression of the guttural pouches, pharynx, and trachea.173 The retropharyngeal abscess may rupture into the pharynx and cause a secondary pneumonia or may rupture dorsally into the guttural pouches.165, 172, 173\n6.Laryngeal hemiplegia. The condition occurs when abscessed lymph nodes encroach on the recurrent laryngeal nerve.174\n7.Tracheal compression following abscessation of the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes. Tracheal compression has been reported. The horse may show respiratory distress or exhibit stertorous breathing. Laryngeal hemiplegia may be an additional complication if the abscess compressing the trachea involves the recurrent laryngeal nerves.174\n8.Endocarditis or myocarditis following abscess formation.9.Agalactia in periparturient mares.10.Suppurative necrotic bronchopneumonia, which may result in death.11.Abscess formation in the central nervous system.175\n12.Myopathies. Two types of muscle disorders associated with S. equi infection have been described recently. One fatal form is characterized by a vasculitis and infarction of skeletal muscle and pulmonary and gastrointestinal tissues. Horses typically have signs of colic and usually are euthanized because of unrelenting pain. Postmortem examination reveals muscle infarctions that are compatible with purpura hemorrhagica. The second type of muscle disorder affects Quarter Horses that have malaise, significant muscle atrophy, and chronic active rhabdomyolysis. Immunocytochemical stains of fast-twitch fibers are positive for equine IgG. Horses responded to treatment with penicillin and dexamethasone with the muscle mass normalizing within 2 months.176\n\n",

Parenteral (killed) vaccines induce strong serum bactericidal activity, but these antibodies are not necessarily protective because mucosal immunity plays a significant role in the resistance to infection.178 In contrast, mucosal immunization induces a combination of systemic and local responses associated with the production of a greater variety of immunoglobulin isotypes and specificities that closely mimic those induced by natural disease. Although intranasal vaccines are expected to produce fewer adverse reactions than parenteral vaccines, lethargy, inappetence, fever, lymphadenopathy, lymph node abscessation, purpura hemorrhagica, and intramuscular abscesses have occurred after vaccination. One should not administer intranasal vaccines concurrently with other parenteral injections because of the risk of abscess formation at the site of the intramuscular injection. One should wash one's hands thoroughly following vaccination. Vaccination of infected horses during an outbreak on a farm may be associated with the development of purpura hemorrhagica. Because of the lack of scientific studies, whether the clinician should implement vaccination in the face of an outbreak is uncertain.

Two subtypes are recognized as infectious for the horse: subtypes H7N7 and H3N8. Subtype H7N7 was first isolated in Prague in 1956 and has been called equine-1 influenza (A/equine/Prague/56). Subtype 1 is thought to have disappeared from horses worldwide because an isolate has not been confirmed since 1980. Subtype H3N8 was first isolated in Miami in 1963 (prototype) and was designated as equine-2 influenza (A/equine/Miami/63). Several variants of subtype 2 (antigenic drift) have been identified and include A/equine/Fontainebleau/79, A/equine/Kentucky/81, A/equine/Saskatoon/90, and A/equine/Newmarket 2(N2/93).178, 180, 181 Compared with the human influenza virus, the equine influenza virus is stable antigenically, not experiencing major antigenic shifts. This stability has been postulated to result from the shorter life span of horses relative to human beings and the lower mutation pressure placed on the equine influenza viruses because of low specific antibody titers.179\n",

Healthy respiratory tract epithelium is ciliated and contains mucus that forms a protective layer over the cell surface. The mucus normally acts as a mechanical barrier between air and tissue and contains antibody and protein substances that deter the attachment of viral particles to the epithelium.183 Neuraminidase activity of the viral particles alters the efficiency of the mucociliary apparatus, allowing the virions to attach via hemagglutinin antigens to sugar groups (sialic acid) on the surface of the epithelial cells. The epithelial cell internalizes the bound virus and surrounds it with an endosome. However, in the mildly acidic conditions of the mature endosome, the hemagglutinin antigen protein becomes activated and promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, leading to release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm.184 Cell necrosis and desquamation follow viral replication within the respiratory tract epithelium. Exposure of irritant receptors causes hypersecretion of submucosal serous glands and further damage to the mucociliary apparatus. Inflammation leads to massive lymphocyte infiltration and edema. Recovery of the normal epithelial architecture can require more than 6 weeks.185 Humoral and cellular immunity are important in providing protection against viral disease: IgA blocks viral penetration but is not bactericidal; certain IgG isotypes, IgGa and IgGb, opsonize the virus particles and enhance phagocytosis.186\n",

One may find submandibular lymphadenopathy, as well as endoscopic evidence of pharyngitis and tracheitis. A mild bronchitis with minimal changes in lung sounds may occur. From experimental studies, inoculation with A/equine-1 produces a milder (subclinical) syndrome unless the animal is stressed before infection, whereas A/equine-2 usually generates the typical clinical signs. The course of the infection usually lasts 2 to 10 days in uncomplicated cases. Exercise exacerbates the clinical signs.187 Secondary bacterial infections may occur, and donkeys and mules appear to have greater susceptibility to secondary infections than horses.188 Horses remain infectious for 3 to 6 days after the last signs of illness.",

Several diagnostic methods for detecting influenza virus antibodies in the horse are available and include complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, single radial hemolysis, viral neutralization, and enzyme immunoassay.189 Acute and convalescent serum samples are needed to establish a definitive diagnosis, and although viral neutralizing antibodies may be detectable within a week of infection, the horse may take up to 28 days to exhibit a rise in hemagglutination titers.179 Serologic testing has been considered to be a sensitive method for diagnosing influenza outbreaks, although in one epidemic, approximately 24% of horses with clinical signs of influenza failed to seroconvert.180\n\n",

However, in a study of 40 abattoir horses, EHV1 and EHV4 were detectable by PCR methods in the bronchial lymph nodes of 88% of the horses examined. Of the trigeminal ganglia examined in nine of the horses, one was found to contain only EHV1, four had detectable EHV4 in the ganglia, and three had evidence of EHV1 and EHV4.202 EHV2 also was isolated from all of the horses examined, leading some researchers to speculate that EHV2 activates the promoter gene of EHV1.203 In addition to the clinical trials, experimental studies of EHV1 and EHV4 also have provided data supporting the fact that lymphoid and neural tissues are sites of viral latency.201, 203\n",

Reexposure usually results in mild or inapparent infections, except in the case of broodmares in which reinfection may lead to abortion in the last trimester. Immunity following abortion is generally of longer duration, and in the field, repeat abortions rarely occur in the same mares.

The virus is delicate and does not survive in the environment; thus close contact appears to be important for transmission.205 Kydd, Smith, Hannant, et al.206 have suggested that EHV1 enters the upper respiratory tract and, in the absence of mucosal antibody, immediately infects the epithelium lining of the nasopharynx and tonsils. Subsequent events depend on whether EHV1 becomes a productive or limited infection. Productive infection results in the intercellular spread of EHV1 through susceptible cells (including leukocytes) in the stroma until the vascular or lymphatic endothelium becomes infected. Thereafter infection spreads via leukocyte adhesion to infected endothelium, leading to the development of cell-associated viremia. As a result of viremia and of inhalation of viral particles, the virus disseminates to the lower respiratory tract. In a limited infection, infected cells are phagocytized and viral antigens are processed and presented to lymphocytes in mucosal lymphoid nodules or lymph nodes. The studies of Burrell89 and Sutton, Viel, Carman, et al.207 have demonstrated lower respiratory tract involvement in which hyperemia and mucous accumulations develop 2 to 12 weeks after the initial infection. EHV1 also has a tropism for lymphocytes and is reported to cause immunosuppression.",

Serotype 1 recently has been renamed equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV) and has been reclassified as a member of the genus Aphthovirus. The reclassification is based on (1) homology of the nucleotide sequence of the ERAV genome with that of foot-and-mouth disease virus, (2) the physicochemical properties of ERAV, and (3) the production of viremia and persistent shedding following ERAV infection.235 Serotype 2 has been renamed equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV) and has been reclassified as the sole member of the genus Erbovirus. A third serotype designated P313/75 also has been identified and currently is assigned to the family Picornaviridae. However, based on sequence similarity and serologic data, investigators have proposed that P313/75 be classified as a distinct serotype of Erbovirus and tentatively have named it ERBV2.236\n",

At its division from the trachea, the right bronchus assumes a straighter, more horizontal position relative to the left bronchus, a configuration that may predispose the horse to develop right-sided pulmonary disorders. Each bronchus divides into lobar, segmental, and subsegmental bronchi with the eventual formation of bronchioles. In the distal part of the bronchial tree the terminal bronchioles lead into poorly developed respiratory bronchioles or open directly into alveolar ducts.249, 250 The tracheobronchial lining consists of tall columnar, pseudostratified epithelium interspersed with serous and goblet cells. The goblet cells and the underlying submucosal mucous glands function to produce mucus consisting of an outer gel and an inner sol layer.251 Mucus serves to prevent epithelial dehydration, contains protective factors that guard against infectious agents, and is an integral part of the mucociliary apparatus.

The major source of blood is the pulmonary circulation, a low-pressure, low-resistance system that serves primarily to deliver blood to the alveoli for participation in gas exchange but also provides nutrients to the alveolar constituents. The distribution of the pulmonary arterial flow to the various lung regions depends largely on mechanical forces: gravity and pulmonary arterial, pulmonary venous, and alveolar pressures.255 In the standing horse, a vertical perfusion gradient of the lung has been demonstrated,256 the most dorsal part of the equine lung being less well perfused than the ventral dependent regions. The distribution of pulmonary blood flow also is influenced by vasoactive compounds such as catecholamines, histamine, and eicosanoids and by changes in alveolar oxygen and carbon dioxide. Alterations in pulmonary vascular resistance may help to match ventilation with perfusion and optimize gas exchange.",

The vagus nerve not only contains the efferent fibers of these pathways, which help to alter airway resistance, lung volume, and compliance, but also contains the afferent fibers the central input of which regulates the pattern of breathing. Stimulation of the parasympathetic fibers within the vagus nerve (i.e., the efferent limb) releases acetylcholine from the postganglionic fibers and combines with the muscarinic receptors of the airway smooth muscle to cause bronchoconstriction. Yet because atropinization (antagonism of muscarinic receptors) does not normally change airway resistance, the parasympathetic system appears to exert little influence on resting airway tone in the healthy horse.260 However, vagal efferents are important in reflex bronchoconstriction during pulmonary disease.",

The lung contains hydrolytic enzymes that cleave peptides such as bradykinin and angiotensin I, thus serving to inactivate (bradykinin) or to bioactivate (angiotensin) compounds. The enzymatic activity responsible is concentrated within the caveolae of the pulmonary capillary endothelium or in pouchings in the plasma membranes of these cells.271 Other pulmonary enzymes exist that are capable of cleaving phosphate groups from nucleotides (adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate), of oxidizing steroid hormones (testosterone), of inactivating prostaglandins E and F, and of metabolizing biogenic amines such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine, and tyramine.255, 271, 272\n",

A hyperfibrinogenemia (>500 mg/dl), hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and anemia of chronic inflammation are compatible with the diagnosis of chronic bacterial pneumonia. Endoscopic evaluation of the upper respiratory tract may demonstrate a defect in the laryngeal pharyngeal function if this is the inciting cause. One may observe a mucopurulent exudate with or without traces of blood by endoscopy in the lower respiratory tract. Thoracic radiographs demonstrate a radiopacity in the anteroventral thorax and a loss of clarity in the lung fields caudal to the heart. Air bronchograms occasionally are found in the adult horse with bacterial pneumonia (Figure 7-13\n). Ultrasound may demonstrate consolidation of ventral lung lobes and extension of the pneumonia to the pleural surfaces. Tracheobronchial aspirates yield degenerative neutrophils, damaged epithelial cells, and microorganisms. The presence of squamous epithelial cells supports a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, provided that the tracheal catheter was not misplaced in the pharynx during sampling. The clinician should perform aerobic and anaerobic cultures on the tracheal aspirates.",

The aminoglycosides are efficacious against most gram-negative aerobes, but lack efficacy against anaerobes. However, metronidazole is effective against most anaerobes, including the penicillin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis and routinely is included in the treatment protocol. Depending on the culture sensitivity results, one also may administer potentiated sulfonamides. The clinician should use aminoglycosides judiciously in animals that have renal compromise or are dehydrated. (See the section on treatment for parapneumonic effusions.)",

The goal of supportive care should be to minimize stress and ensure adequate ventilation and hydration. Ideally, horses should be bedded on paper or on other materials free of dusts or molds and should be fed forages of excellent quality. One should also direct attention to correcting the primary cause of the pneumonia. Depending on the chronicity of the pneumonia, one should note clinical improvement in 48 to 72 hours. The prognosis can be excellent if the pneumonia is treated aggressively, but the clinician should forewarn the owner of potential complications (see the following discussion).

The investigators suggested that these antigens were released during mycelial growth in the tissues, a phase that would not develop in clinically healthy horses.

Art, Kirschvink, Smith, et al.413 suggested that an oxidative stress caused by the release of reactive oxygen species from granulocytes and macrophages develops in the airways of heaves-affected horses. Their conclusion is based on the finding that oxidized glutathione levels and glutathione redox ratios (the ratios of oxidized glutathione to total glutathione levels) are elevated in the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid of heaves-affected horses relative to controls. They further suggested that the oxidant stress does not incite but rather exacerbates the existing inflammation. Interestingly, oxidative stress414 has been found to activate NF\u03baB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1.415 Recently, Bureau, Bonizzi, Kirschvink, et al.416 demonstrated that levels of NF\u03baB in the bronchial brushing cells of heaves-affected horses were increased many times, the magnitude of which correlated with the severity of the clinical disease. Furthermore, the airway epithelial cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, a protein required for migration of neutrophils from the pulmonary vasculature into the lung parenchyma, paralleled the expression of NF\u03baB, suggesting that this protein, along with IL-8, enhances the airway neutrophilia.",

The pulmonary hypertension is a consequence of the high cardiac output, the lack of sufficient pulmonary vascular vasodilation and the increased blood viscosity during exercise. Evidence supportive of the stress failure theory is provided by electronmicrographs prepared from lung segments taken from strenuously exercised horses. These demonstrate a breakdown of the endothelial and epithelial tight junctions and exudation of red blood cells into the alveoli.466 Although some investigators have found no correlation between pulmonary capillary pressures in exercising horses and the development of EIPH ascertained endoscopically,467 others have found a correlation between mean pulmonary artery pressures in exercising horses and the number of erythrocytes in postexercise bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples.468\n",

Radiographs may demonstrate increases in interstitial patterns, a radiopaque region in the caudal lung lobe (rare), and possible dorsal displacement of the major pulmonary vessels469 (Figure 7-20\n).",
