The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, was the epicenter of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2, which rapidly spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020 [1]. COVID-19 has led to complications such as acute respiratory disorder, heart problems, and secondary infections in a relatively high proportion of patients and thus significant mortality. Early detection and commencement of treatment in severe cases is key to reducing mortality [1].",

One report, of 1041 cases from China, found that sensitivity of COVID-19 detection on chest CT was 97% (95%CI, 95\u201398%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results [2]. CT chest images for COVID-19 positive cases have a distinct radiographic pattern: ground-glass opacities, multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes with a predominantly peripheral distribution [2, 3]. A study of 21 patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus, found that 15 (71%) had involvement of more than two lobes at chest CT, 12 (57%) had ground-glass opacities, seven (33%) had opacities with rounded morphology, seven (33%) had a peripheral distribution of disease, six (29%) had consolidation with ground-glass opacities, and four (19%) had crazy-paving pattern. No lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were seen. Fourteen percent of patients (three of 21) presented with a normal CT scan [3]. Information and CT scans are available from this current outbreak, which shows the evolvement of lung opacities over time, from symptom onset to 41 days from onset (Fig. 1), in a COVID-19 positive patient [4].",

For example, one study developed on existing 2D and 3D deep-learning models, combining them with the latest clinical understanding, and achieved an AUC of 0.996 (95%CI: 0.989\u20131.00) for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies. They calculated a sensitivity of 98.2% and a specificity of 92.2% [8]. This system comprised of several components and analyzed each CT case at two distinct levels: Subsystem A: 3D analysis of the case volume for nodules and focal opacities (using a commercial software called 3D lung volume from RADLogics Inc.) and Subsystem B: newly developed 2D analysis of each slice of the case to detect and localize larger-sized diffuse opacities including ground glass infiltrates. Furthermore, they proposed a Corona score: a volumetric measurement of the lung opacities, and an effective way to monitor patient progress over time. This study performed much better than the one reviewed in this paper, in terms of rate of detection, sensitivity, and specificity, mainly because the system used was specifically developed for the detection of COVID-19 manifestations.
