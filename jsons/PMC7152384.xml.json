Because transplacental transfer of maternal IgG occurs primarily in the third trimester, the serum IgG levels of many preterm neonates are very low. Soon after birth, maternal IgG levels begin to decline, and neonatal production of antigen-specific immunoglobulins begins. Serum IgG concentrations reach about 60% of adult levels by 1 year of age in term neonates [6]. Given the incomplete transfer of maternal IgG and an impaired ability to produce antigen-specific immunoglobulins, premature infants typically have significantly lower levels of serum IgG than their term counterparts, a difference that can persist throughout the 1st year of life. Developmental issues of other organ systems can also affect the risk of HAIs. The immature gastrointestinal tract, characterized by reduced acidification of gastric contents and the fragile integrity of the intestinal epithelium, provides another potential portal of entry for pathogens.",

The in utero environment is sterile; however, colonization begins within the first few days of life. The acquisition of normal colonizing flora is disrupted in hospitalized newborns for various reasons, including the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the hospital environment and on the hands of health care workers, the frequent use of antimicrobial agents, and exposure to invasive procedures. As a result, the microflora of infants in the NICU can be markedly different from healthy term infants [7,8]. Multidrug-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species colonize the skin and the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of a high proportion of NICU neonates by the 2nd week of hospitalization [[9], [10], [11], [12]]. In addition, hospitalized neonates can become colonized with Candida and other yeasts [[13], [14], [15], [16]].",

Approximately 90% of hospitalized neonates with an infection presumed to be of maternal origin had onset of symptoms within 48 hours of birth.

Investigators have suggested that fat emulsions could have a direct effect on the immune system [41]. Alternatively, as with any intravenous fluids, parenteral alimentation has the potential for intrinsic and extrinsic contamination, and fat emulsion especially may serve as a growth medium for certain bacteria and fungi. Finally, total parenteral alimentation and intravenous administration of fats likely delay the normal development of gastrointestinal mucosa because of lack of enteral feeding, encouraging translocation of pathogens across the gastrointestinal mucosa.

National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) and PPN surveillance data estimate that 32% of total pathogens and 48% to 51% of bloodstream infections are caused by these organisms [18,22]. Although an infrequent cause of fatal infection, bacteremia caused by CoNS has been associated with prolonged NICU stay and increased hospital charges, even after adjustment for birth weight and severity of illness on admission [45]. A 10-year, prospective, multicenter Australian study found that 57% of all late-onset infections during the study period were due to CoNS. Molecular techniques suggest that infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis can result from clonal dissemination and that there is often concordance between the strains infecting infants and strains carried on the hands of health care workers [28,46,47]. In one study, four clones accounted for 43 of 81 study strains (53%) [28]. This finding suggests that a significant proportion of CoNS infections may be preventable by strict adherence to infection control practices. The fact that a hand hygiene campaign was associated with increased hand hygiene compliance and a lower rate of CoNS-positive cultures further supports this contention [48].",

Enterobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Serratia marcescens are the members of Enterobacteriaceae most commonly encountered in the NICU. Many outbreaks owing to gram-negative bacteria have been reported. Underlying causes of these outbreaks include contaminated equipment [[63], [64], [65], [66]], formula or breast milk [[66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71]], and intravenous fluids [[72], [73], [74]]; understaffing; overcrowding; and poor hand hygiene practices [[75], [76], [77], [78]]. The origins of these organisms are often unclear, although many authors hypothesize that at least some episodes of gram-negative bacteremia are a consequence of intestinal translocation. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that enteric feedings have been associated with a reduced risk of gram-negative infections [79].",

Nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections vary in their clinical presentation, but the most common manifestations are respiratory; ear, nose, or throat; and bloodstream infections [18]. P. aeruginosa infections, particularly bloodstream infections, have been associated with a very high mortality rate [80]. Risk factors for infection include feeding intolerance, prolonged parenteral alimentation, and long-term intravenous antimicrobial therapy [80]. Outbreaks owing to P. aeruginosa have been linked to contaminated hand lotion [81], respiratory therapy solution [82], a water bath used to thaw fresh frozen plasma [83], a blood gas analyzer [84], and bathing equipment [85]. Health care workers and their contaminated hands also have been linked with Pseudomonas infections in the NICU. In a study of a New York outbreak, recovery of Pseudomonas species from the hands of health care workers was associated with older age and history of use of artificial nails [86]. This and other studies suggest that the risk of transmission of Pseudomonas to patients is higher among health care workers with onychomycosis or who wear long artificial or long natural nails [86,87]. As a result of these and other findings, the CDC revised its 2002 hand hygiene recommendations to include a recommendation against the presence of health care workers with artificial fingernails in intensive care units [88].",

The potential for airborne transmission has been suggested by \u201ccloud babies,\u201d described by Eichenwald and colleagues [102], in which the respiratory secretions or desquamated skin from a colonized infant carry S. aureus over relatively long distances. \u201cCloud\u201d health care workers also have been described; in such cases, the point source of an outbreak was determined to be a colonized health care worker with a viral respiratory infection [94,103].

Vancomycin use, which is especially prevalent in the NICU, has increased markedly and has probably contributed to the growing prevalence of resistant gram-positive organisms in neonatal patients [108]. More recent observations suggest that clinical infections caused by VRE may signal the presence of a larger reservoir of VRE among asymptomatic colonized infants, and some authors have suggested that active surveillance may be required to interrupt ongoing transmission [109,110].",

K. pneumoniae and E. coli are the organisms most commonly recognized as ESBL-producing organisms, but other ESBL-producing gram-negative bacilli are being increasingly identified. NICU outbreaks caused by other ESBL-producing organisms have been identified; transfer of ESBL-carrying plasmids to other Enterobacteriaceae organisms has been shown in several NICU outbreaks [111,112]. Two mechanisms of acquisition of resistant gram-negative organisms have been shown through molecular epidemiologic investigations: patient-to-patient transfer (presumably via contaminated health care worker hands or medical equipment) and de novo emergence as a consequence of antibiotic exposure [113,114].",

Over time, there was an overall decrease in candidemia in neonates weighing less than 1000 g, but no change in the distribution of Candida species.

Colonization likely precedes infection, and this can occur either vertically (via the maternal genitourinary tract) or horizontally (nosocomial spread). The relative roles of gastrointestinal tract colonization and enteric translocation versus skin surface colonization and catheter-related infection are unclear and not mutually exclusive [121]. A prospective study, including 35 infected neonates, suggested that risk factors for candidemia included gestational age 32 weeks or younger, Apgar score less than 5, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, intralipid use, parenteral nutrition, CVCs, H2 blockers, intubation, and length of stay more than 7 days [35]. Various other studies have largely confirmed or expanded on these results, including two more recent reports. A prospective, multicenter study by Benjamin and coworkers [116] analyzed data from 320 infants with extremely low birth weight and invasive candidiasis and found birth weight less than 750 g, male gender, delayed enteral feeding, and cephalosporin use all to be associated with disease. Cotten and associates [122] reported on 3702 infants with extremely low birth weight in 12 NICUs, linking candidiasis with third-generation cephalosporin use.",

Aspergillus infections may manifest as pulmonary, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, or disseminated disease. A cutaneous presentation, with or without subsequent dissemination, seems to be the most common presentation for hospitalized premature infants without underlying immunodeficiency [128,129]. Often, skin maceration is the presumed portal of entry. In a series of four patients who died of disseminated Aspergillus infection that started cutaneously, a contaminated device used to collect urine from the male infants was implicated [129]. Similarly, contaminated wooden tongue depressors, used as splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites, were associated with cutaneous infection owing to Rhizopus microsporus in four premature infants [130]. In addition to preterm birth, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, steroid therapy, and hyperglycemia are thought to be risk factors for mold infection.",

In addition, rotavirus can be manifested as frequent and watery stools in term infants and as abdominal distention and bloody, mucoid stools in preterm neonates [133,135]. A high titer of virus is excreted in stool of infected persons, and the organism is viable on hands and in the environment for relatively prolonged periods [136,137]. Attention to hand hygiene and disinfection of potential fomites are crucial in preventing spread of infection. Rotavirus outbreaks in NICUs have been associated with poor hand hygiene, ill health care workers, and ill visitors [137].

The latter presentation can be associated with a high mortality rate [149]. Several outbreak investigations have shown the introduction of enterovirus into a nursery via vertical transmission to an index case, with subsequent horizontal spread [149,151].

Postnatal CMV infection in premature infants can be severe, however, and associated with hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, or pneumonitis [[152], [153], [154]]. The incidence of postnatal CMV infections in preterm infants has decreased significantly with the routine use of CMV-seronegative blood products. At present, most postnatal CMV infections are acquired through breast milk [155]. Approximately one third of infants who are breast-fed by mothers with CMV detected in breast milk can develop infection [156]. In one study, approximately 50% of these infants had clinical features of infection, and 12% presented with a sepsis-like syndrome. At present, no proven, highly effective method is available for removing CMV from breast milk without destroying its beneficial components. Some data suggest, however, that freezing breast milk before use may decrease the CMV titer, limiting subsequent transmission [157]. Person-to-person transmission within the NICU has also been documented [158,159], but the extent to which this occurs is controversial [160]. More detailed information on the clinical features and management of CMV is presented in Chapter 23.",

Contamination of the catheter exit site has also been identified as a mechanism of infection in pediatric and adult patients. Finally, infusion of contaminated fluids, medications, or blood products can also give rise to catheter-associated bloodstream infections.",

A compendium of strategies to prevent specific HAIs has been endorsed by the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America and the Infectious Diseases Society of America and includes detailed information on strategies to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infections (Table 35\u20134\n) [174]. A key strategy to minimize the risk of catheter-associated bloodstream infections is the prompt removal of indwelling catheters when no longer medically necessary. Practices such as early enteral feeding and rapid conversion to oral medications whenever possible can shorten the length of time a patient requires a catheter. Finally, participation in quality improvement activities focused on improved hand hygiene and better adherence to best practices for catheter placement and maintenance has been shown to reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections in NICUs [175].",

More recent data in neonatal patients have shown, however, that catheter placement in the lower extremity is not associated with an increased risk of infection in neonates [176]. Umbilical veins and arteries are available for CVC insertion only in neonates. The umbilicus provides a site that can be cannulated easily, allowing for collection of blood specimens and hemodynamic measurements, but soon after birth, the umbilicus becomes heavily colonized with skin flora and other microorganisms. Nonetheless, rates of catheter colonization and catheter-associated bloodstream infections attributable to umbilical catheters are similar to rates associated with other types of CVC. Colonization rates for umbilical artery catheters are estimated to be 40% to 55%; the estimated rate for umbilical artery catheter\u2013related bloodstream infection is 5% [169]. Colonization rates are 22% to 59% for umbilical vein catheters; rates for umbilical vein catheter\u2013related bloodstream infections are 3% to 8% [169].",

The investigators noted a significant reduction in the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (relative risk 0.13; 95% confidence intervals 0.01 to 0.57) [178]. A single-center randomized clinical trial of fusidic acid\u2013heparin solutions infused and held within a catheter lumen was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of catheter-associated bloodstream infections (6.6 versus 24.9 per 1000 catheter days; P < .01; relative risk 0.28; 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.60). The high rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections in the control group of infants suggests that this intervention might not be beneficial in settings that have already achieved low infection rates [179].

Appropriate placement of enteral feeding tubes should be verified before their use [190,191]. To prevent regurgitation and potential aspiration of stomach contents by a sedated patient, overdistention of the stomach should be avoided by regular monitoring of the patient's intestinal motility, serial measurement of residual gastric volume or abdominal girth, reducing the use of narcotics and anticholinergic agents, and adjusting the rate and volume of enteral feedings [190,191]. Oral decontamination, with the intent of decreasing oropharyngeal colonization, has been studied in adults and seems to reduce the incidence of VAP [192,193].

The definitions provided by the CDC have been widely adopted and provide specific definitions and data collection for the NICU population [[208], [209], [210]]. These definitions do not distinguish, however, late-onset infections caused by transplacentally acquired organisms (e.g., group B streptococcus infections) from more typical nosocomial infections [210]. Distinction between maternal and hospital sources of infection is important, although difficult at times, because control measures designed to prevent acquisition from hospital sources would be ineffective in preventing perinatal acquisition of pathogens [211]. Surveillance for infections in healthy newborns also is challenging because of the typically short length of stay. Infections can develop after discharge, and these are more difficult for infection control practitioners to capture. Methods for postdischarge surveillance have been developed, but because most neonatal infections that occur after discharge are noninvasive [212], such surveillance has not been widely implemented owing to concerns about the cost-effectiveness of these labor-intensive processes.",

Compared with washing with soap and water, use of the alcohol-based products is at least as effective against a variety of pathogens and requires less time, and these agents are less damaging to skin. The CDC \u201cGuideline for Hand Hygiene in the Health Care Setting\u201d calls for use of alcohol hand rubs, foams, or gels as the primary method to clean hands except when hands are visibly soiled [88]. Specific activities that have been independently associated with increased density of pathogens on health care worker hands include skin contact, respiratory care, and diaper changes. Additionally, investigators have shown that the use of gloves during these activities does not fully protect health care workers' hands from bacterial contamination [219]. Programs that have been successful in improving hand hygiene and decreasing nosocomial infection have used multidisciplinary teams to develop interventions focusing on use of the alcohol rubs in the setting of institutional commitment and support for the initiative [26,220,221].",

Routine hand washing throughout care delivery should consist of wetting the hands, applying product, rubbing all surfaces of the hands and fingers vigorously for at least 15 seconds, rinsing, and patting dry with disposable towels [88]. Wearing hand jewelry has been associated with increased microbial load on hands; whether this results in increased transmission of pathogens is unknown. Many experts recommend, however, that hand and wrist jewelry not be worn in the nursery [222,223]. In addition, the CDC guideline states that staff who have direct contact with infants in NICUs should not wear artificial fingernails or nail extenders [88]. Only natural nails kept less than \u00bc inch long should be allowed; at least one outbreak in an NICU was associated with a health care worker who wore artificial nails [224].",

The benefits of family-centered care can be undermined by an increased risk of infection for the neonatal patient. Mothers can transmit infections to neonates postpartum, although separation of mother and newborn rarely is indicated. To ensure the risk of postpartum transmission is minimal, all mothers should wash their hands before handing their infants. For mothers with postpartum fever, care should be taken to ensure that the infant does not come into contact with contaminated dressings, linen, clothing, or pads [234].",

If not performed carefully, bathing can be detrimental to the infant, resulting in hypothermia, increased crying with resulting increases in oxygen consumption, respiratory distress, and instability of vital signs [177]. Although the initial bath or cleansing should be delayed until the neonate's temperature has been stable for several hours, removing blood and drying the skin immediately after delivery may remove potentially infectious microorganisms such as hepatitis B virus, HSV, and HIV, minimizing risk to the neonate from maternal infection [234]. When the newborn requires an intramuscular injection in the delivery room, infection sites should be cleansed with alcohol to prevent transmission of organisms that may be present in maternal blood and body fluids [170]. For routine bathing in the first few weeks of life, plain warm water should be used. This is especially important for preterm infants and full-term infants with barrier compromise such as abrasions or dermatitis. If a soap is necessary for heavily soiled areas, a mild pH-neutral product without additives should be used, and duration of soaping should be restricted to less than 5 minutes no more than three times per week [177].",

            "text": "Few randomized studies comparing cord care regimens and infection rates have been performed, and consensus has not been reached on best practice regarding care of the umbilical cord stump. A review published in 2003 described care regimens used for more than 2 decades, including combinations of triple dye, chlorhexidine, 70% alcohol, bacitracin, hexachlorophene, povidone-iodine, and \u201cdry care\u201d (soap and water cleansing of soiled periumbilical skin), and found variable impact on colonization of the stump [246]. The study authors suggested that dry cord care alone may be insufficient and that chlorhexidine seemed to be a favorable antiseptic choice for cord care because of its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. They went on to stress, however, that large, well-designed studies were required before firm conclusions could be drawn. The current Perinatal Guidelines do not recommend a specific regimen, but warn that use of alcohol alone is not an effective method of preventing umbilical cord colonization and omphalitis [241]. The Perinatal Guidelines further recommend that diapers be folded away from and below the stump and that emollients not be applied to the stump [177].",
