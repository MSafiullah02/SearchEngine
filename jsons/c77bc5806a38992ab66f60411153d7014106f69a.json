While comparison between both samples was done with BLAST (Altschul et al, 1997) , the subtractions of the human transcriptome and genome reads were carried out by BLAT (Kent, 2002) search on the references downloaded from Ensembl version GRCh37.53 (Flicek et al, 2011 ; http://www.ensembl.org/ ).

Simulated viral reads were matched against viral genomes and hg19 reference using the previously chosen BLAST protocol. Similarly, in silico extracted human genome reads (115 nts) were also aligned to human and viral databases with same parameters. These resulted in combined BLAST output files for 597 true positive viral reads and 597 true positive human reads, used in turn as a training set for the LDA. Accordingly to previous observations, the discriminant function was built on the \"alignment length\" and \"E-value\" variables. Specifically, it was based on the observed difference in alignment length and E-value for the \"virus versus human\" BLAST results comparison. The classifier showed 80% of true positives for the viral class while zero false positives were observed for the human class. The obtained LDA coefficients were later employed to filter out candidate viral reads showing better alignments to human genome plus transcriptome. LDA was implemented with the MASS package (http://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/MASS/ ) in the R environment (Venables & Ripley, 2002; R Development Core Team, 2011) .",

This primate betaretrovirus carries at its 5' end two long terminal repeats separated by 63 nucleotides complementary to tRNA-Lys, the usual primer for reverse transcription of the viral genome (Sonigo et al, 1986) . To study the presence of additional MPMV reads in our transcriptomes, we conducted a BLAST search of all non-ribosomal reads of each sample against the three MPMV genomes currently available (AF0033815.1, M12349.1 and U85506.1). An average of 801.0 \u00b1 317.5 reads per sample were identified as matching anti-sense to the PBS, whereas none other region of the MPMV genome appeared covered. Following these reads throughout our pipeline, for instance 1,244 reads from the CLL250 sample, 41 of them had been mapped by BWA to hg19 assembly at positions annotated as tRNA-Lys. Remaining 1,203 reads were first recovered when searched with BLAST in the viral database and then recovered again as human genome plus transcriptome reads in the next pipeline step. All these reads were classified as \"human\" by the classifier but 367 (including the 336 candidate MPMV reads) had posteriors lower than 0.9 and thus were finally searched in the non-redundant database, eventually exhibiting the highest similarity to MPMV. Further analysis of these 1,203 reads revealed that they are chimeric-like sequences, where the first stretch of the read derives from a tRNA-Lys precursor while the following region is variable (see GC content decay in Fig S3A) , pointing that none single analysed read could be extended beyond the retroviral PBS. Of note, the 336 MPMV reads are enriched with the 3' CCA extension of the mature tRNA (Fig S3B) raising the possibility that additional tRNA processing modifications could have occurred (Findei\u03b2 et al, 2011) , thus impairing their similarity to human references. Lastly, as they seemed to be tRNA derived sequences, we assumed that this phenomenon could be widespread and searched putative MPVM's PBS reads in other DSN normalized human samples as well as other tRNA derived sequences among our unmapped reads (data not shown). Both approaches gave positive results thus definitively excluding a true viral origin of these reads. 10% to 50% of the original genomic nucleotides were randomly changed and 100 reads of 115 nts length were extracted for each divergence level (three replicates per level were performed). The number of reads aligning to the starting genome decreased with the divergence level but increased through more exhaustive BLASTN protocols. The inset shows the modified parameters in each protocol. ",

(A) Change in the G+C content of all 1,203 reads along position. While there is a clear signature in the first 63 nts (coincident with the PBS length), the G+C content turns to 50% in the second part of the reads, pointing to a random composition. This suggest the presence of chimeric reads with a common first region (the one that aligns anti-sense to the PBS) and a variable second part. (B) The frequency of the CCA triplet is followed along the reads. The black line corresponds to the 336 reads recovered as MPMV-like reads in the final BLASTN search. The grey shadow corresponds to the 867 reads assigned to \"human\" by the LDA. The expected CCA end added during tRNAs maturation (arrow) is more frequent in the MPMV-like reads, suggesting the presence of additional changes in these reads. It is known that modified bases in the template end up as sequencing errors (although certain base pairing rules prevail), thus impairing read similarity to the reference sequence when aligned.
