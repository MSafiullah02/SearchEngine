Therefore, the obvious indication to transfuse blood would be too increase oxygen delivery which should then theoretically increase tissue oxygen tension and tissue oxygen utilization. Unfortunately there is little data to support this concept and it is likely that blood transfusion increases oxygen utilization only in patients with a hemoglobin of less than 4 g/dL\u2026. Yes that is right, less than 4 g/dL [8, 9] . A number of studies in critically ill patients have measured oxygen consumption before and for up to 6 h following a blood transfusion. All of these studies have failed to demonstrate an increase in tissue oxygen tension and oxygen utilization following blood transfusion [10] [11] [12] . Indeed, paradoxically (dependent on the age of the transfused cells), red blood transfusions may compromise tissue oxygenation.",

While the risk of transfusion transmitted infections has received considerable attention, the risks of this complication with modern blood banking techniques is now exceedingly remote [13] . On the other hand, it is now becoming clear that there are other important, less recognized risks of RBC transfusion related to RBC storage effects and to immunomodulating effects of RBC transfusions which occur in almost all recipients [14, 15] . The risks of blood transfusion include 2 60-72 mmHg 6 % Hemoglobin 10-12 g/dL 18 % both infectious and non-infections complications; these are listed below [16] . Several strategies such as leukoreduction and shorter storage times (still under investigation) have been employed to reduce transfusion complications.

This observation was subsequently confirmed in prospective clinical trials [19] . TRIM may result in either immune activation or immune suppression, this being dependent on the interaction between host and donor factors. Clinical syndromes associated with immune activation in the recipient include a variety of transfusion reactions including febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), transfusion associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD), transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), alloimmunization and possible development of various autoimmune diseases. Syndromes associated with tolerance induction and immunosuppression include increased predisposition to nosocomial and postoperative infections, cancer recurrence, microchimerism and enhanced survival of various allografts in recipients.",

            "text": "While TRIM appears to be a ubiquitous phenomenon the mechanisms leading to immunomodulation remains poorly understood. A number of mechanisms have been proposed relating to the transfusion of donor antigen presenting cells (APC), donor stem cells (leading to microchimerism), donor white blood cells, donor immunoglobulins, donor cytokines from activated WBC's and iron and free hemoglobin from hemolyzed red blood cells. It is likely that these mechanism act in concert to alter the immune status of the host. Allogenic blood transfusions introduce a multitude of foreign antigens including HLA-class II bearing donor dendritic antigen presenting cells (APC) in recipients. Blood transfusions induce TRIM in two opposite ways causing either i) allo-immunization or ii) tolerance induction. Immunization is reflected by the induction of HLA alloantibodies and T cell activation, while the induction of tolerance is suggested by enhanced renal, hepatic, cardiac, pancreatic and skin allograft survival in transfused versus non-transfused recipients. Presence or absence of \"autologous\" HLA-DR Ag on the leucocytes of the transfusion donor plays a decisive role whether immunization or immune suppression will ensue following allogenic blood transfusion [20] . Transfusions sharing at least one HLA-DR antigen with the recipient will induce tolerance while fully HLA-DR mismatched transfusions lead to immunization. Accumulation of various soluble bioactive substances occurs during storage and includes histamine, lipids, cytokines, fragments of cellular membranes, soluble HLA class I antigens, many of which are WBC derived and play an important role in TRIM. TRIM associated immunosuppression has been associated with a decrease in the helper:suppressor T-lymphocyte ratio, a decrease in natural killer cell function, defective antigen presentation and suppression of lymphocyte blastogenesis. Since WBC's are assumed to play a pivotal role in TRIM, it has been suggested that leukodepleted blood may have less immunomodulating properties and hence reduce the complications associated with the transfusion of non-leukodepleted blood. Hebert and colleagues reported a retrospective before-andafter cohort study conducted from August 1998 to August 2000 in 23 hospitals in Canada, enrolling 14,786 patients who received RBC transfusion following cardiac surgery or repair of hip fracture [21] . A total of 6,982 patients were enrolled during the control period and 7,804 patients were enrolled following prestorage leukoreduction. In this study the adjusted odds of death following leukoreduction were reduced (OR 0.87; CI 0.75-0.99) but serious nosocomial infections did not decrease (OR 0.97; CI 0.87-1.09). Furthermore, the frequency of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR) decreased significantly (OR 0.86; CI 0.79-0.94) as did antibiotic use (OR 0.90; CI 0.82-0.99). While the risk of nosocomial infections were not reduced in the study by Hebert et al., a meta-analysis investigating the use of leukodepleted RBC transfusions in surgical patients demonstrated a significant reduction of postoperative infections (OR 0.522; CI 0.33-0.82, p = 0.005) [22] .",

This \"shelf-life\" is based on criteria set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which requires that 75 % of transfused RBCs must be recoverable in the peripheral blood circulation 24 h after transfusion [23] . The reported mean storage duration of blood in the US is 18 days [2] . However this varies widely, with larger tertiary/ quaternary hospitals generally transfusing older blood than smaller community hospitals. The mean age of blood transfused in ICU patients varies from about 16 to 24 days with \"younger\" blood being transfused in European as compared to US ICUs [6, 7] .

With storage the RBC loses its biconcave shape, become more spherical and spiculated. The physical changes that occur to stored RBCs appear to be similar to those that occur to diseased RBCs (such as in malaria, sickle cell disease, thalassemia).

The cytotoxic effect of free heme is related to its pro-oxidant activity driven by the divalent Fe atom contained within its protoporphyrin IX ring, which promotes the production of free radicals [27] . Free heme has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis [28] . The pro-inflammatory cytokines released following exposure to a pathogen act synergistically with free heme to promote oxidative injury [28] . In addition, free hemoglobin binds with nitric oxide (NO) leading to endothelial dysfunction and contributing to the intravascular thrombosis, vasoconstriction, and leukocyte adhesion which occurs in the septic patient [26] . The pathogenetic importance of free heme in patients sepsis is supported by an observational study reported by Janz and colleagues who demonstrated a significant increase in the mortality of septic patients with increasing concentration of cell-free hemoglobin [29] . Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the breakdown of heme into equimolar amounts of biliverdin, iron and carbon monoxide. HO-1 has a protective effect in severe sepsis and it is likely that genetic polymorphisms of this enzyme play a role in determining the severity of the septic response [27, 28] .",

The most recent theory to explain the increased risk of infectious complications following blood transfusion and the interaction with the duration of storage relates to an increased concentration of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron, which promotes proliferation of pathogenic bacteria [30, 31] . In mouse models, transfusion of RBCs stored for longer durations was followed by brisk extravascular clearance of cells damaged during storage by macrophages in the spleen and liver [31] . The iron liberated by phagocytic digestion of these RBCs rapidly entered the systemic circulation in amounts that exceeded the transport capacity of plasma transferrin, increasing the concentration of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron. A study conducted in healthy volunteers reported the presence of higher extravascular hemolysis after older RBC transfusion (storage of 40-42 days) compared with fresh blood (storage of 3-7 days) [32] . In this study transferrin saturation and non-transferrin-bound iron increased significantly after transfusion of the old blood. The increased concentrations of non-transferrin-bound iron correlated with enhanced proliferation in vitro of a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli.",

However, the clinical importance of the storage lesions is controversial as all of the studies demonstrating an association between storage time and adverse outcomes are observational studies many of which are small studies [33] . Furthermore, a number of studies have been unable to find an association between adverse clinical outcomes and the duration of storage [25, 33] . Those studies that have shown an increased risk of complication with \"old\" blood suggest that the increased risk of complications occurs with blood stored for longer than 14 days [10, 33, 34] . To complicate this issue further, Phelan et al. demonstrated that the deleterious effects of aging on banked blood are ameliorated by pre-storage leukoreduction [35, 36] .",

Multiple observational studies have demonstrated that blood transfusion is associated with an increased risk of postoperative and nosocomial infections, increased length of hospital stay and increased mortality. While sicker patients receive more blood transfusions, multivariate analysis has consistently demonstrated that blood transfusions are independent predictors of infectious complications, morbidity and mortality. We performed a meta-analysis of 45 cohort studies that assessed the effect of RBC transfusion on patient outcomes [15] . These studies included postoperative, cardiac and ICU patients. Twenty-two studies examined the association between RBC transfusion and nosocomial infection; in all these studies blood transfusion was an independent risk factor for infection. The pooled odds ratio for developing an infectious complication was 1.8 (95 % CI; 1.5-2.2). Hill and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of studies investigating the risk of postoperative infections in patients receiving a blood transfusion [38] . In this study, the odds ratio ranged from 1.43 to 15.15, with a common odds ratio of 3.45. A more recent meta-analysis by Rohde et al. demonstrated that in hospitalized patients a liberal transfusion strategy (as compared to a restrictive strategy) was associated with an increased risk of health care associated infections [39] . It is important to note that leukodepletion has reduced but not eliminated the risk of infections complications following a blood transfusion. A metaanalysis by Blumberg et al. reported that leukoreduced transfusions reduced the odds of a postoperative infection by approximately 50 % (OR 0.522; CI 0.332-0.821; p = 0.005) [22] . In a large prospective study which included 5,158 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery at 10 centers in the United States and Canada, Horvath and colleagues demonstrated a dose-related association between the quantity of RBCs transfused (all leukocyte-reduced) and risk of infection, with the risk increasing by an average of 29 % with each RBC unit transfused [40] . Similarly in ICU patients, Juffermans and colleagues have demonstrated that transfusion of leukodepleted blood increases the risk of secondary infections [41, 42] . In this study patients who received older blood had an increased risk of infections [42] . These studies provide overwhelming evidence that RBC transfusions increase the risk of postoperative and nosocomial infections; this risk is reduced but not eliminated by the transfusion of leukodepleted blood.",

This reaction may occur either during or up to 1-2 h following the transfusion. Additional features include increases in respiratory rate, changes in blood pressure, anxiety and, more unusually, nausea or vomiting. FNHTRs are the most commonly encountered transfusion reaction occurring in approximately 0.5-2.0 % of units transfused and are more likely to occur following transfusion of platelets than RBCs. FNHTRs and believed to be due to leucocyte activation, either donor or receipt with the release of cytokines (similar mechanism to acute TRALI). Leucocyte reduction decreases the incidence of FNHTRs with prestorage leucocyte reduction being more effective than post-storage leucocyte reduction. Fever following a transfusion is attributed to FNHTR when other potential life-threatening transfusion reactions, such as acute homolytic transfusion reaction, bacterial contamination or TRALI are excluded. In patients with suspected FNHTR the transfusion should be immediately discontinued. The remainder of the transfused unit and a posttransfusion blood sample from the patient should be sent to the laboratory for further investigation. FNHTRs are typically benign, and usually resolve completely within 1-2 h after the transfusion is discontinued. Antipyretics may be administered to shorten the duration of the fever and provide analgesia. About 10-15 % of patients who experience an FNHTR may have a similar reaction in the future transfusion [43] . Administration of antipyretics (acetaminophen) 30-60 min before starting transfusion is often recommended for a patient who has had two or more FNHTRs, although there is little data to support this approach.",

Although all blood components have been implicated, TRALI is more commonly associated with plasma-containing products (e.g., FFP and aphaeresis platelets), which account for the majority (50-63 %) of TRALI fatalities. TRALI is characterized by the abrupt onset of respiratory failure within 6 h following the transfusion of a blood product. While TRALLI is usually mild and resolves within hours it is the commonest cause of death following the transfusion of a blood product. It is likely that TRALI is underdiagnosed with the features of respiratory compromise frequently being ascribed to circulatory overload (TACO). TRALI is usually caused by donor anti-leukocyte antibodies. A single unit of packed cells or blood component product (FFP and platelets) is usually implicated in initiating this syndrome. It has, however, recently been recognized that the transfusion of blood products in critically ill or injured patients increases the risk for the development of acute lung injury (ALI) 6-72 h after the transfusion. This \"Delayed TRALI Syndrome\" is common, occurring in up to 25 % of critically ill patients receiving a blood transfusion, and is associated with a mortality of up to 40 % [44] . While the delayed TRALI syndrome can develop after the transfusion of a single unit, the risk increases as the number of transfused blood products increase. The management of both the classic and delayed TRALI syndromes is supportive.",

CD40L binding to vascular endothelial cells stimulates the expression of metalloproteinases, matrix-degrading enzymes implicated in plaque rupture and thrombosis. RBC transfusions in patients with cancer, traumatic injuries and subarachnoid hemorrhage have been reported to have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboses [47] [48] [49] . Increasing storage time (presumably with an increased released of bioactive lipids) appears to increase the pro-thrombotic properties of transfused blood [48] .",

An isolated decrease in hemoglobin concentration to 10 g/dL with all other parameters remaining constant will result in an oxygen delivery that remains approximately twice that of the resting oxygen consumption. Humans have a remarkable ability to adapt to anemia by increasing cardiac output (in the absence of volume depletion), increasing microcirculatory density, as well as by increasing red cell synthesis of 2,3-DPG with a resultant rightward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (aids oxygen unloading) and by increasing oxygen extraction. Healthy volunteers can tolerate isovolemic hemodilution down to hemoglobin concentration of 4.5 g/dL without apparent harmful effects [54] . However, due to the high extraction ratio of oxygen in the coronary circulation, coronary blood flow appears to be the major factor which limits the tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations. In experimental animal models of coronary stenosis, depressed cardiac function occurs at hemoglobin concentrations between 7 and 10 g/L [55, 56] .",

Multivariate meta-regression revealed that blood transfusion was associated with a higher risk for mortality independent of baseline hemoglobin level, nadir hemoglobin level, and change in hemoglobin level during the hospital stay. Blood transfusion was also significantly associated with a higher risk for subsequent myocardial infarction (OR 2.04; CI 1.06-3.93, p = 0.03). Rao and colleagues examined the potential impact of red blood cell transfusion in 24,111 patients with ACS [70] .

It can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, which if sufficiently severe, produce organ dysfunction' [74] .

The initial activation of coagulation in sepsis is primarily dependant on activation of the extrinsic (tissue-factor dependant) pathway. DIC is generally considered to be a systemic hemorrhagic syndrome. However, this is only because hemorrhage is obvious and often impressive. Less commonly appreciated is the formidable microvascular thrombosis that occurs. Fibrin deposition in the microcirculation is a frequent, if not invariable finding in patients with DIC. This microvascular thrombosis is closely related to the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and is therefore closely linked to the prognosis of patients with DIC. This microvascular damage is especially pronounced in the lungs and kidneys. In septic patients with DIC, the thrombotic (antifibrinolytic) pathways tend to dominate. The DIC that characterizes the early stage of traumatic shock is characteristically hemorrhagic (fibrinolytic) which then becomes thrombotic by day 2-4; this pattern has important implications with regards to resuscitation with blood and blood products [75] . A dilutional coagulopathy and DIC frequently occur in cases of massive hemorrhage regardless of their cause. Coagulation tests can be used to assess the severity of the dilutional coagulopathy and DIC as well as their evolution under the influence of therapeutic interventions. However, coagulation tests fail to predict the risk of bleeding (see below).",

Trauma-induced coagulopathy is multifactorial in origin and includes dilution, acidosis, hypothermia and a process known as acute traumatic coagulopathy characterized by global anticoagulation and fibrinolysis [80] . Damage control resuscitation targets acute traumatic coagulopathy with the early administration of FFP. Evidence from both civilian and military practice suggests improved outcomes with damage control resuscitation [80, 81] . While varying ratios of FFP to RBC have been proposed the optimal ratio appears to be between 1:1 and 1:2 [80, 81] . An additional theoretical benefit of FFP relates to its effect on the endothelial glycocalyx (see Chap. 9). Experimental models have demonstrated marked degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx following hemorrhagic shock [82, 83] , which was restored following an infusion of FFP [83] . Resuscitation with FFP may therefore improve both coagulation as well as endothelial integrity with improved microvascular blood flow following traumatic injuries [83] .",

Approximately 1/3 of all FFP is used to prepare patients with an elevated INR or PTT for a procedure [84] . Transfusion of FFP prior to an invasive procedure in patients with abnormal coagulation test results rests upon two assumptions: [85] \u2022 that abnormal coagulation test results identify patients at increased risk of procedure-related bleeding and \u2022 that transfusion of FFP will reduce that risk For patients with mild to moderate abnormalities of coagulation test results, evidence to support these two assumptions is scant to non-existent. A growing body of literature documents that the INR and PTT do not predict which patients will have procedure-related bleeding and should not be used to make decisions about prophylactic preprocedure transfusions [86] . Several factors account for this lack of predictive value for bleeding. Coagulation tests such as the PT and PTT were developed primarily to identify specific coagulation deficiencies such as hemophilia. In addition, they are carried out in vitro (in a test tube), at room temperature, and may fail to reflect the efficacy of coagulation pathways in vivo, which are affected by both core temperature and the interaction with circulating cells and substances. Clinical data suggests that there is no increased risk of bleeding in patients with PT or INR values within 1. [87] . In this study all patients with a mildly prolonged INR had levels of coagulation facts within the hemostatic normal range. Based on this data the authors recommended that plasma not be transfused to simply correct this abnormal laboratory value.",

For the great majority of patients who are given such transfusions-namely, those with mild to moderate prolongation of the INRthere is very little evidence to support this assumption [85] . In fact, the evidence speaks to the contrary. Holland and Brooks reported the effect of FFP on the INR in 179 patients with a prolonged INR who were given FFP for a variety of indications [88] . For patients with INR's of 1.7 or less, infusion of FFP in typical doses used had no effect on the patient's INR. For patients with INR values greater than 2, the correction of INR was modest and incomplete. For example, even for patients with an INR = 4.0, the average correction with FFP transfusion was partial resulting in an INR = 3.0. Similar findings were reported by Abdel-Wahab et al. who noted that among 121 adult patients with a pretransfusion INR of 1.6 or less who were given 1-4 units of FFP, the posttransfusion INR corrected to within the normal range in only two patients [89] .

Doerfler described their experience with placement of 104 central lines in 76 coagulopathic medical patients. All insertions were performed by experienced operators; none of the patients received \"prophylactic\" transfusions of platelets or FFP [91] . There were no serious bleeding complications, with only minor bleeding (skin) in 7 (6.5 %) patients (who had a mean platelet count of 22,000 \u03bcL \u22121 ). Similarly, Mumtaz et al. reviewed their experience in 330 surgical patients with disorders of hemostasis [92] .

In these patients, there were three bleeding complications requiring placement of a purse string suture at the catheter entry site. These authors concluded that \"central venous access procedures can be safely performed in patients with underlying disorders of hemostasis.

All the patients had coagulopathies (prothrombin time activity less than 50 % and/or a platelet count less than 50,000 \u03bcL \u22121 ). In 74 patients, the common carotid artery was inadvertently punctured. A clinically detectable hematoma occurred in ten patients; in one patient, the hematoma compressed the airway; this patient recovered completely after a surgical drainage. In this patient, puncture of the internal jugular vein was difficult because of a goiter, but the carotid artery apparently was not punctured. Similarly, Foster and colleagues reported on their experience with 200 cannulations in patients undergoing liver transplantation who had coagulopathies (that remained uncorrected) [95] .

The interventions include administering vitamin K and/or infusing fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa. The preferred approach is based largely on the potential risk of bleeding, the presence of active bleeding, and the level of the INR [99] . Phytonadione (vitamin K1, a form of vitamin K derived from plants) has been used in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy [100] . When oral phytonadione is administered in conjunction with temporary interruption of warfarin therapy, approximately 1.4 days are required for an INR between 6 and 10 to decline to <4.0 [100] . When administered intravenously, low doses of phytonadione produce similar reductions as oral phytonadione in the INR value at 24 h, whereas subcutaneous phytonadione appears to be less effective than low-dose oral phytonadione. The response to vitamin K administered subcutaneously is less predictable than that of oral or IV vitamin K. Dezee performed a meta-analysis of trials that used vitamin K to treat patients without major hemorrhage with an INR greater than 4.0 [101] . The primary outcome was achievement of the target INR (1.8-4.0) at 24 h after vitamin K administration. This study demonstrated equal efficacy of oral and IV vitamin K (1.0-2.5 mg) in normalizing the INR, whereas subcutaneous vitamin K was no better than placebo.",

To minimize the risk of anaphylactoid reactions, vitamin K1 should be mixed in a minimum of 50 mL of intravenous fluid and administered, using an infusion pump, over a minimum of 20 min [100] . High doses of vitamin K, though effective, may lower the INR more than is necessary and may lead to warfarin resistance for 1 week or more. Low doses of vitamin K are therefore recommended.

A platelet count of less than 100,000 \u03bcL \u22121 is seen in 20-50 % of ICU patients, whereas 12-15 % of patients will have a platelet count of <50,000 \u03bcL \u22121 at some point during their ICU admission [104] [105] [106] . Typically the ICU patient's platelet count decreases during the first 4 days in the ICU [107] . Regardless of the cause, thrombocytopenia is an independent predictor of ICU mortality in multivariate analysis with a relative risk of 1.9-4.2 in various studies [105] . In an observational study of 820 patients with severe community acquired pneumonia admitted to the ICU, Brogly et al. found that thrombocytopenia on admission was an independent predictor of mortality [108] . Moreau reported that a 30 % or more decline in platelet count by the fifth ICU day was an independent predictor of death [106] . The causation of thrombocytopenia in ICU patients is often multifactorial, with sepsis being the most important cause. Thrombocytopenia is an early sign of sepsis and may occur in the absence of other features of DIC. Dilutional thrombocytopenia due to blood and fluid replacement is the second most common cause of thrombocytopenia in the ICU. Other causes include: [109] . The mechanism of DIT is decreased platelet production from bone marrow suppression, increased platelet destruction, or platelet sequestration. DIT can develop from either nonimmune or immune causes. Nonimmunemediated DIT is the result of bone marrow suppression from agents including antineoplastics, antivirals, ethanol, thiazide diuretics, and tolbutamide, and it develops slowly over a period of several weeks. Heparin is the medication most commonly associated with DIT. A nonimmune-mediated and an immune-mediated form of thrombocytopenia occur from heparin (see HIT below). Nonimmune-mediated thrombocytopenia occurs in 10-20 % of patients receiving unfractionated heparin 1-4 days after initiation. Platelets typically do not decrease to 100 \u00d7 10 9 L \u22121 . Linezolid is the antimicrobial most likely to cause thrombocytopenia. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia is not fully understood, although potential mechanisms include direct myelosuppression and immune mediated platelet destruction. Vancomycin and fluoroquinolones may be under-recognized as a cause of thrombocytopenia [109] .",

            "text": "Elderly patients are frequently prescribed anti-platelet drugs; intracerebral hemorrhage is not an uncommon complication in these patients. Platelet transfusion has therefore been considered in patients taking an anti-platelet drug who suffer an intracerebral bleed. While no RCT has been performed data from observational studies suggest the platelet transfusions do not improve outcome [112] . There is currently an ongoing study known as the Platelet Transfusion in Cerebral Hemorrhage trial, which aims to answer this question in the setting of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [113] . This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study, which will examine the effect of platelet transfusion within 6 h compared with standard care. Recognition of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and HIT with thrombosis (HITT) is of particular importance given its paradoxical association with thrombosis. HIT/HITT is an immune-mediated disorder that is triggered by exposure to any form of heparin; it is also known as type II HIT, to distinguish it from the non-immune-mediated, mild thrombocytopenia associated with heparin termed type I HIT. Type II HIT is caused by the generation of heparin-induced, platelet activating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that recognize heparinplatelet factor 4 complexes [114] . The resulting platelet activation and thrombin generation lead to a significant risk of both arterial and venous thrombosis. Depending on the patient population studied, the risk of thrombosis has ranged from 29 to 89 %. Even after cessation of heparin therapy, the threat of thrombosis persists. In one study, the 30-day risk of thrombosis after the diagnosis of HIT was 53 % [115] . However, only a small proportion of patients who form HIT antibodies (seroconversion) will develop thrombocytopenia, and a smaller proportion will develop HIT-associated thrombosis. The incidence of HIT varies depending on the patient population studied and the type of heparin preparation used. Patients undergoing cardiac or orthopedic surgery are among those at highest risk of developing HIT. HIT is less common in medical patients, with studies suggesting a frequency of 1 % or less [114] . Women have approximately twice the risk of developing HIT as men. Patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) are at increased risk of HIT compared with those given the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) preparations. Diagnosis of HIT requires consideration of both clinical and serologic findings. Because nonpathogenic heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies occur commonly in patients treated with heparin, a positive test for HIT antibodies is not sufficient to make the diagnosis. Diagnostic specificity can be increased by use of a sensitive washed platelet activation assay; a positive platelet activation assay is much more specific for clinical HIT than a positive platelet factor 4-dependent immunoassay. However, given the risk of thrombosis in patients with HIT, appropriate therapy should not be withheld while awaiting the results of serologic testing. HIT should be suspected in patients who develop thrombocytopenia or experience a relative drop in platelet count of >50 %, typically occurring 4-10 days after initiation of heparin therapy. Thrombocytopenia may occur much more rapidly after exposure to heparin, however, in patients who have received heparin within the previous 100 days. New or recurrent venous or arterial thromboses in patients who are receiving, or have recently received, a heparin product should also raise suspicion for HIT. It should be appreciated that in about 25 % of HIT patients, a thrombotic event during heparin treatment precedes the subsequent HIT-associated platelet count fall [114] .",

There is a correlation between the degree of reactivity in the EIA, expressed in optical density (OD) units, and the presence of PF4/heparin antibodies. Thus, the greater the magnitude of a positive EIA test result, the greater the likelihood that the patient has HIT. Functional assays, such as the serotonin release assay (SRA) and heparin induced platelet activation (HIPA) are sensitive and specific for HIT because they only detect antibodies that are capable of activating platelets. HIT is recognized as a clinicopathologic syndrome because diagnosis is based on the combination of a compatible clinical picture and the presence of platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies [116] . The 4Ts clinical prediction rule has been developed as an aid in the diagnosis of HIT (see Table 38 .4) [116] . Patients with a low 4Ts score have a very low probability of HIT (0-3 %), however, many patients (24-61 %) with a high 4Ts score prove not to have HIT [116, 117] . This suggests that clinical assessment plays an essential role in the diagnosis of HIT.",

These manifestations are due to widespread microvascular thrombosis involving the capillaries and arterioles of the brain and other organs. Thrombocytopenia results from consumption of platelets, whereas erythrocyte fragmentation and hemolysis may be due to mechanical injury as the red cells encounter the intravascular thrombi or abnormally high levels of shear stress. Typically, TTP affects previously healthy adolescents or adults and almost invariably follows a rapid course of deterioration and death unless plasma infusion or exchange therapy is instituted immediately. A similar disorder occurs in children, the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Childhood HUS, typically preceded by abdominal pain and diarrhea is recognized as a complication of infection caused by bacteria that produce Shiga toxins, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7. Currently, about 90 % of children with typical HUS survive with supportive care, without plasma exchange treatment. The pathophysiological hallmarks of acute TTP are von Willebrand factor (VWF)-platelet-rich thrombi occluding the microvasculature. The VWF-platelet thrombi are thought to be the consequence of insufficient processing of newly secreted, extremely adhesive and ultra large VWF multimers. In the majority of patients, this insufficient processing of ultra large VWF multimers is the result of a severe deficiency of the VWF-cleaving protease, now denoted as ADAMTS13 [118] [119] [120] . ADAMTS13 activity levels are less than 10 % of normal control in patients who have acute TTP. TTP is considered an autoimmune disease, with ADAMTS13-binding IgG is detectable in 97-100 % of cases.",

Each unit will raise the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL, with the goal of maintaining a fibrinogen level of at least 100 mg/dL [123] .
