This event is called \u2018recoding\u2019 (Gesteland and Atkins, 1996, Baranov et al., 2002). Programmed frameshifting is one type of recoding event in which a ribosome shifts reading frame by one or more nucleotides at a specific mRNA signal between overlapping genes (Baranov et al., 2002). It is known to play an important role in autogenous control. Frameshifts are classified according to the number of nucleotides shifted and the direction of shift. Most known programmed frameshifts are \u22121 or +1 frameshifts (slippage of one base either forward or backward).",

For example, infectious viruses such as HIV, human herpes virus, and human coronavirus are known to utilize programmed frameshifting. Many factors appear to be involved in programmed frameshifting, but the mechanism of programmed frameshifting is not fully understood despite a lot of biochemical approaches and some computational approaches. Previous works have identified several slippery sequences and stimulatory structures as major factors of programmed frameshifting. Thus, there should be a compilation to summarize these factors and to provide useful information for users.",

RECODE (Baranov et al., 2001, Baranov et al., 2003) has been the only database that provides information about recoding events based on the scientific literature and personal communications. It covers three kinds of recoding event: programmed frameshifting, readthrough, and bypassing. RECODE offers useful information such as gene name, cis-elements, trans-elements, product and references, but does not provide complete details of frameshifting. For example, it is not easy to figure out the overall structure of a frameshift signal from the text-based information of RECODE. The locations of the slippery sequences in several RECODE entries differ from those in GenBank, causing confusion to users who want to locate a frameshift site in the sequence.",

Second, the same GenBank accession number may appear in more than one RECODE entry. For example, in +1 frameshifting, Botryotinia fuckeliana has the same accession number (AF291578.1) as Schizosaccharomyces japonicus. Third, some RECODE entries are redundant with the PseudoBase data. Fourth, some slippery sequences are too simple and are found too many times in a sequence.

It also allows the user to find frameshift sites himself/herself from genome sequences using the program FSFinder.
