Given the extrinsic factors (e.g. resource constraints, high morbidity/mortality) of the COVID-19 pandemic and the intrinsic factors (e.g. high-risk population, lower immune system, many at advanced stage) of cancer patients, practitioners face great responsibilities in ensuring timely, appropriate, compassionate and justified cancer care, while protecting themselves from getting infected with COVID-19 [1] . Reported prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients (1%) seems higher than its prevalence in the overall population [2] . Early data from two small and heterogeneous populations [3] shows that 39%-54% of cancer patients were reported to have a severe event (admission to intensive care unit -or death) when infected with COVID-19 [2, 4] . Receiving anti-tumor therapy or surgery within 2-4 weeks of developing symptoms [2, 4] predicted worse outcomes.",

The challenges imposed by COVID-19 impact every aspect of care starting with diagnosis of cancer; all the way, to end-of-life care for cancer patients, which concerns patients about receiving suboptimal care (figure 1). To enable oncologists to navigate the COVID-19 public health crisis, all major oncology societies eg.

Slower spread would avoid overwhelming the health system and allow high-risk patients with cancer to receive necessary routine medical services.

However, since patients with cancer are uniquely vulnerable to the virus due to a weaker immune system, it is reasonable to withhold or postpone therapy until the patient is asymptomatic. Moreover, similarities between treatment related-adverse events and COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever, pneumonitis and colitis) are challenging in patients receiving active cancer treatment. Since we do not know if patients on immunotherapy are at a higher risk for pneumonitis or cytokine storm, streamlining COVID-19 testing with shorter turnaround time and using steroid-sparing strategies in managing immune-related adverse events can help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.",

Splitting healthcare teams is a strategy where staff is geographically segregated into two teams: clinical (each clinic team has its own registration, triage, venipuncture, consultation room, and lavatories) and non-clinical [7] In disease such as acute myeloid leukemia, where intensive chemotherapy is considered emergent, testing all patients for COVID-19 prior to initiation of induction and delaying or de-intensifying treatment for patients who test positive for COVID-19 has been recommended. Healthcare workers taking care of cancer patients must be uninfected with COVID-19, pass screening for COVID-19 (questionnaire and thermal scan) and follow strict personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines. Several efforts have aimed at addressing the increasing shortage of PPEs including increasing supply, rationing, and reutilization (+/-sterilization). A challenge facing providers is that being asymptomatic does not necessarily mean one is not currently infected with COVID-19 [8] and cannot infect cancer patients. Therefore, viral testing with PCR could allow for periodic staff monitoring ensuring that staff are infection-free. Prioritizing healthcare workers on high-risk units (bone marrow transplant, and acute leukemia) could address the caveat of limited testing availability. Another aspect of testing is serological (i.e. IgG and IgM antibody) testing, which hypothetically detects established immunity [9, 10] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f faces several challenges including selection of the right testing antigen, the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus, and their ability to prevent re-infection. Over 70 test developers claim an effective test. However, to date, the FDA has issued only one Emergency Use Authorization for a qualitative COVID-19 serological testing vi . Using the analogy of hepatitis B vaccination and surface antibody testing, maturation of antibody testing will help the development of an effective vaccine.",

To avoid risk of harm to themselves, they may require a longer period of quarantine than the general population. Stopping travel and working with local oncologists to treat patients at a local hospital could avoid unnecessary exposure to COVID-19. Other potential solutions would be to reschedule surveillance imaging and rely on telemedicine for clinical surveillance (i.e. clinical history). In addition to analyzing cancer patients who are infected with COVID-19, the collateral damage of COVID-19 in cancer patients who were not infected with COVID-19, yet might have received sub-optimal care due to having restaging scans rescheduled, cancelled or postponed is worth analyzing for future reference.",

Furthermore, COVID-19 in cancer research is advancing at a breakneck speed, and tele-multidisciplinary tumor boards have broadened collaborations across the globe, for challenging cancer cases as well as for research. In addition, analyzing the \"real world\" outcomes of patients who received modified and/or alternate cancer care schedules (e.g. chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation) will allow us to identify patient cohorts who may benefit from modified treatment protocols.

In addition, shortages in blood products in certain parts of the U.S. means that oncologists should minimize use of myelosuppressive regimens and lower the threshold for transfusion when possible. In the U.S., the Food and Drug administration (FDA) revised its recommendations to address the unprecedented challenge to blood supply due to COVID-19 v .

Major cancer conferences have been cancelled and/or rescheduled. Hence, data that are critical in advancing cancer care and research may be delayed. With overflowing hospitals and strained health care workers, newly diagnosed and existing patients with cancer may not get the right treatment at the right time. As an interim solution, several institutes and societies are holding virtual conferences so that findings can still be discussed and disseminated.
