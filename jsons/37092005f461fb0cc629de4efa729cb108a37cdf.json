They consist of an enveloped virus particle with characteristic petal-shaped spikes, which give an appearance of a crown, or corona, thus giving the name for the virus. The viral envelope contains two glycoproteins, one of which forms the spikes and the other the matrix proteins. The spikes interact with virus receptors on the cell surface, thus determining the target-cell specificity of the virus. Inside the viral envelope is a helical nucleocapsid which is composed of a nucleocapsid protein N and the RNA genome. The genome is a single piece of RNA of more than 18,000 nucleotides. The RNA is of positive sense, meaning that the viral genome can be directly translated into proteins.",

The 5'-portion of each mRNA therefore contains a unique sequence which does not overlap with the smaller mRNAs. This unique portion is the functional part of each mRNA.

            "text": "Although the presence of a leader sequence is a common feature of eukaryotic mRNAs, the synthesis of coronavirus mRNAs does not appear to utilize the conventional RNA splicing mechanism, which involves cleavage of intervening sequences from a precursor RNA. Two pieces of data suggest that the leader sequences present at the 5'-end of coronavirus mRNAs are probably derived by a novel mechanism: (1) coronaviruses replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells,l1* l2 while conventional RNA splicing takes place in the nucleus; and (2) ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of coronavirus-infected cells resulted in the inhibition of individual mRNA synthesis at a rate proportional to the size of the mRNA.I3 The UV target size of each coronavirus mRNA is approximately the s a q q s its physical size, suggesting that each subgenomic mRNA is transcribed independently. If these mRNAs were derived from the cleavage of a precursor RNA, as in the case of conventional RNA splicing, the UV target size for inhibition of the synthesis of all the mRNAs would be expected to be equal to that of the genomic RNA. Thus a novel mechanism for the generation of these mRNAs is most likely utilized by coronaviruses. Several transcriptional models for coronavirus mRNAs have been proposed (Fig. 2) .14 (!) The 'loop-out' model in which the RNA template forms a loop in the 'intron' region, thus bringing the leader RNA in close proximity to the initiation sites of subgenomic mRNAs. The RNA poly-merase can thus jump from the leader sequence to the mRNAs in continuous transcription. For smaller mRNAs the loops will be larger. (2) The 'leaderprimed transcription' model in which the leader RNA is transcribed and becomes dissociated from the RNA template. This 'free' leader RNA then binds to the template at the initiation sites of various mRNAs and serves as the primer for transcription. (3) The ' post-transcriptional processing' model in which the leader RNA and the body sequences are transcribed independently and then joined together by a transsplicing mechanism post-transcriptionally. A considerable body of data14 suggests that the first and third models are not compatible with the replication mechanism of coronavirus RNA. Thus, the ' leader-primed transcription' model is considered to be the most likely mechanism utilized for the transcription of coronavirus mRNAs.",

(3) During a mixed infection with two different MHVs, the mRNAs of each virus contain a population with the leader RNA sequences derived from the co-infecting virus. 16 This result suggests that the leader RNA is a separate transcriptional unit and can be freely exchanged between the mRNAs of two co-infecting viruses.

The sequence of the 5'-end of MHV genomic RNA reveals a possible leader RNA termination signal, i.e. a hairpin loop followed by an AU-rich sequence, approximately 84 nucleotides from the 5'-end (Fig. 3) .17 This is consistent with the size of the free leader-containing RNA species detected in the infected ~e1ls.l~ Close to the 3'-end of the putative leader RNA, there is a stretch of 9-18 nucleotides, which is homologous to the genomic sequences at the initiation points of various ~R N A s .~' . Thus the leader RNA would be able to bind to the RNA template at these sites. The homologous sequences are not located at the exact 3'-end of the free leader RNA, and there is also a mismatched nucleotide within some of the homologous regions. These mismatched nucleotides in the leader RNA have to be removed before transcription takes place. Thus the mechanism of MHV RNA transcription involves the synthesis of a free leader RNA species from the 3'-end of the negative-sense RNA template, followed by its binding to the intergenic regions via the homologous sequences. The leader RNA is then cleaved at the mismatched point, generating the primer for the initiation of mRNA transcription (Fig. 3) . Therefore, the leader-body fusion sites vary with the mRNA species, depending on the location of the mismatched nucleotide.",

The transcription of mRNAs and replication of genomic RNA appear to be catalyzed by separate RNA polymerases. Although the replication of the genomic RNA represents faithful copying of the RNA template, it probably follows a discontinuous and 'stop-andgo' mode. This mechanism was suggested by the discovery of many discrete species of small leadercontaining RNAs in the MHV-infected ~e1ls.l~ The sizes of these RNA species correspond to the lengths between the 5'-end and the probable hairpin loops on the genomic RNA. Thus they may represent transcriptional 'pausing' intermediates which stop at the regions of secondary structure on the RNA template.
