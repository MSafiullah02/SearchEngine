In truth, every organism on Earth continuously encounters nanometer-sized entities (Rizzello et al. 2011; Pandey et al. 2008; Bennett-Woods 2006) . Very small particles, so-called nanoparticles, have the ability to enter, translocate within, and damage living organisms (Elsaesser and Howard 2012; Prabhu and Poulose 2012) . This ability results primarily from their small size thereby allowing them to penetrate physiological barriers and travel within the circulatory systems of a host (Panessa-Warren et al. 2006; Li et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2016) . The vast majority causes little ill effect and goes unnoticed, but occasionally an intruder will cause appreciable harm to the organism. The most advanced of the toxic intruders are viruses, composed of nucleic acid-based structures that allow them not only to interfere with biological systems but also in parasitically exploit cellular processes to replicate themselves (Ravindran et al. 2016; Franzen and Lommel 2009) . A growing number of recent studies show, however, that nano-and microorganisms might play a vital role in many chronic diseases where infection pathogens have not been suspected, diseases that were previously attributed only to genetic factors and lifestyle (He and Shi 2009; Zheng et al. 2016) . These diseases include leukemia (caused by viruses from the retrovirus and herpesvirus families) (Nisole et al. 2005; Walther and Stein 2000; Jarrett 2006) , cervical cancer (Papillomavirus) (DiMaio and Liao 2006;

Looking at the molecular machinery of life that began in the early 1930s, but truly modern molecular biology emerged with the uncovering of the structure of DNA in the 1960s (Meyer 2003; Morange and Cobb 2000) . As a science that studies interactions between the molecular components that carry out various biological processes in living cells, an important idea in molecular biology states that information flow in organisms follows a one-way street: genes are transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into proteins. The molecular components make up biochemical pathways that provide the cells with energy, facilitate processing \"messages\" from outside the cell itself, generate new proteins, and replicate the cellular DNA genome. For example, molecular biologists study how proteins interact with RNA during \"translation\" (the biosynthesis of new proteins), the molecular mechanism behind DNA replication, and how genes are turned on and off, a process called \"transcription\" (Lodish et al. 1995) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 184, "text": "(Crick 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 361, "end": 373, "text": "(Meyer 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 374, "end": 396, "text": "Morange and Cobb 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1189, "text": "(Lodish et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "State of the Art"}, {"text": "The birth and development of molecular biology were driven by the collaborative efforts of physicists, chemists, and biologists.

This field and its requisite technology took off in the 1990s with the Human Genome Project's effort to sequence billions of bases to unlock a new era of genetically informed medicine (Sawicki et al. 1993; Venter et al. 2001) . The resulting science is still a work in progress -it turns out the genetic code a more complicated one than anticipated -but the technologies and companies helped it spawn are an impressive legacy. The Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) got its start during the Human Genome Project, as it produced single nucleotides (the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that comprise the genetic code) and short oligonucleotide chains (or \"oligos\") to facilitate a massive sequencing effort around the world (Burns et al. 1996) . Of course, sequencing technology has advanced dramatically in the intervening decades, but \"you still need oligos to do the sequencing,\" explains Jerry Steele, IDT's Director of Marketing, \"especially in the next generation sequencing space, sequencing and DNA synthesis go hand in hand.\" The current sequencing method of choice is Illumina, a process that frequently returns millions of bases of DNA sequence by reading distinct stepwise fluorescent signals associated with each base in a massively parallel array (Schadt et al. 2010; Nakamura et al. 2011) . To distinguish genetic material from different samples (a few hundred are often run on the same plate), scientists label each sample's DNA extract with a distinct barcode (Hebert et al. 2003) .

These chains are used not only in Illumina barcoding but also as primers, consistent patches of sequence that may border unknown regions and facilitate polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification (Bhargava et al. 2013) . Both techniques -\"next-generation\" Illumina sequencing and primer-based amplification -are staples of any self-respecting applied or research-based microbiology laboratory, as they allow researchers to identify constituent organisms or confirm a gene's presence. With such short sequences, a single nucleotide discrepancy could mean the difference between two Illumina samples from opposite ends of the world or between a gene native to the Firmicutes or the Proteobacteria. It's a small margin for error, \"so every base better be right,\" explains Steele. \"As we've grown, it's just a matter of maintaining that consistency on a larger scale.\" In the spirit of not fixing something that needs no repairs, IDT shipped an entire fabrication room from its headquarters in Coralville, Iowa, to Belgium when that facility was being built.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 350, "text": "(Bhargava et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "State of the Art"}, {"text": "Fundamental as they are to modern biology, oligos are used every day in thousands of laboratories around the world, often in innovative ways that the company itself may not have predicted. \"The things that people are doing with DNA are really inspiring,\" noted Steele.

Gold nanoparticles play a major role in cancer therapeutics owing to its enhanced surface plasmon resonance (Huang et al. 2007; Kah et al. 2007) . DNA delivery into cell applications employs silica nanoparticles (Roy et al. 2005; Kneuer et al. 2000; Slowing et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2002) . Another interesting area of research is to realize biocompatible implants for replacing damaged or worn body parts with improved tissue engineering at the nanoscale and extend its arms for building up bioartificial organs (McIntire 2002; Mendon\u00e7a et al. 2008; Variola et al. 2009 ), nano-hydroxyapatite being a reliable candidate for bioimplants due to its excellent biocompatibility (Zhou and Lee 2011; Wang et al. 2012) .

There is an interesting classification of nanotechnology in two classes, \"wet\" nanotechnology (living biosystems) and \"dry\" nanotechnology.

Few examples of such concepts can be lotus effect, pearl effect, Gecko effect, butterfly wings, Namib desert beetle, spider web, and so on (Bhushan 2009; Pereira et al. 2015) .
