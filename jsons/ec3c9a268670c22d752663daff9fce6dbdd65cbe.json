Simulation surgeries should be evaluated by experts and its effectiveness quantified before instituting into a training program. Institutions should have a method to record the trainee's performance and track his or her progress in the long term. Although still a newer technology, simulation-based surgery has the potential to greatly influence surgeon training and efficiency. While attractive, simulation training is not without its disadvantages or barriers to be implemented. Simulation machines are very costly and often take up a significant amount of space that many hospitals and programs do not have, and only allow for a few specific surgical procedures to be performed.",

Now is the opportunity to decide how and what we must change in this new era. Let's make sure that however we move forward, we do with safety in mind for all of us and keep the traditions and mission of our society alive.",

            "text": "Introduction COVID-19 has upended medicine and education, dramatically impacting how we learn and train our future surgeons. The American College of Surgeons, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the United States Surgeon General have recommended delay of all elective and nonessential medical and surgical procedures to minimize the spread of disease and conserve medical supplies and personal protective equipment to avoid crisis levels needed for sick patients. These recommendations have had an immediate downstream effect on all orthopaedic resident and fellow education. New guidelines from the American Board of Medical Specialties and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education have emerged and continue to evolve on how to achieve milestones, modify training log requirements, while still able to satisfy all graduation competencies. The majority of our annual and biennial meetings for our great societies have been postponed or cancelled with some organizations searching for answers to fill the need to keep us current with virtual meetings consisting of pre-recorded talks to generate a web-based educational library. Surgical skills training and workshops are all on hold. The changing landscape of education has abruptly forced us to critically evaluate the current modes of educational delivery.",
