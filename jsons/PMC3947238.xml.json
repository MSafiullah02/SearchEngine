For this study, 97 specimens per group were randomly selected (www.randomizer.org) from each of 2 groups: those with detectable respiratory viruses and those without detectable respiratory viruses. This sample size was selected based on 2-sided testing, with \u03b1 = 0.05, power = 80%, and hypothesized 20% difference in bacterial detection rates (effect size). The PEP trial spanned from January 2004 to August 2008 and enrolled 719 participants of whom 713 completed the study (one participant had missing viral nucleic acid result).22 The study rationale and methods have been described previously.23\n",
