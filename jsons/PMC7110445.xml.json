Increasing the number of immunocompromised patients with T-cell mediated immunity deficiencies, mucosal-cutaneous barrier or metabolic dysfunction, neutropenia, aging, excessive use of antibiotics, cytotoxic therapy and transplantation, as predispose risk factors and conditions, significantly influence the higher incidence of IFIs [4]. Moreover, the incidence and prevalence of nosocomial IFI are still high and Candida species represent the third most common blood isolate from hospitalized patients. Out of all IFI, 45% of invasive candidosis are from intensive care units (ICU). Candida bloodstream infection is prolonging stay in the ICU with mortality ranges from 40 to 71%. Also, it can cause complications during the clinical course of primary disease and increases treatment costs [5].",

These infections are caused commonly by dermatophytes, yeasts or non-dermatophytic molds and represent one of the dominant infections worldwide with global prevalence ranges from 22\u201325% [6], [7]. The lack of rapid diagnostic methods for SFI consequently influence that only 3% of physicians in general practice and 40% dermatologists require mycological analyses before prescription of empiric treatment with systemic antifungals [8]. Additionally, these infections can affect the patient's quality of life as a potential cause of social, professional and emotional problems [9]. Thus, fungal infections of the skin, nail or hair could not be considered as a cosmetic problem of relatively minor significance. Given the fact that deep infections and dissemination of pathogen can be expected in immunodeficiency, some genetic abnormalities such as CARD9 mutation, and leukemia [10], [11], the prompt diagnosis and treatment of SFIs could prevent complications and unwanted clinical outcomes.",

Also, frequent changes of local therapy by systemic, with the goal to improve the treatment, probably influences the emergence of resistant Candida species to azoles [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].

However, in comparison with culture, IC Candida assay in vaginal swabs showed the high specificity 99.3%, positive predictive value 98.0, followed by lower sensitivity 80.3%, and negative predictive value 92% for C. albicans. For the second most prevalent species C. glabrata (causing more-intensive and chronic form of genital candidosis), concentration has to be more then 105\n CFU/mL in patients sample [27].",

            "text": "During the last forty years, a number of molecular techniques have been developed for the identification of dermatophytes at species or strain level. These include fingerprinting methods, conventional PCR (employing selected genetic markers e.g. internal transcribed spacers (ITS), chitin synthase 1 gene (chs1), topoisomerase II gene, small and large ribosomal RNA subunit and non-transcribed spacer/NTS region), ITS restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses which change the view to the taxonomy of dermatophytes [29], [30], [31], [32]. Molecular diagnosis provides species-level identification of dermatophytes more accurately regarding their development in human, soil or animals. Recent studies showed that the conventional PCR of ITS and chs1 regions might be helpful tool for a better understanding of dermatophyte identification, taxonomy, ecology and epidemiology [30]. These findings revolutionized the diagnosis of SFI caused by dermatophytes and the use of \u201cin house\u201d or rare commercial molecular tools enable their rapid determination directly in patients sample within 48 h. As for \u201cin house\u201d molecular tools, various types of PCR techniques have been developed in the last decade. These assays had evolution from conventional PCR, nested PCR, pan-nested PCR which was recommended as gold standard with higher sensitivity compared to conventional methods [33], followed by multiplex real-time PCR which provides detection of T. rubrum, T. interdigitale, T. violaceum and M. audouinii\n[34] and later developed single-tube dermatophyte qPCR tool based on ITS1 sequences which design allows determination of 11 species of three dermatophyte genera (Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton) directly in patients sample [35]. Besides, reported multiplex PCR for detection of T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes in nail samples, which is based on chitin synthase I and ITS region, was proved as molecular tool with excellent diagnostic performance (95% sensitivity and 100% specificity) [36]. Few commercial assays have also been designed and some of them with high diagnostic performance such as duplex PCR which combines pan-dermatophyte PCR with a Trichophyton rubrum-specific PCR. This assay provides rapid detection and identification of Trichophyton rubrum in nail specimens and has shown specificity and sensitivity of 94% and 85%, respectively, in comparison with conventional methods [37].",

MN is a major component of Candida cell wall, accounting for up to 7% of total dry cell weight, which is released in bloodstream during Candida replication during infection. The Platelia Candida Ag test (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) enables the detection of MN in blood (serum) samples in ELISA format [53]. Several retrospective and prospective studies have evaluated the utility of MN detection for the diagnosis of invasive candidosis in haematological and ICU patients with an overall sensitivity (Sn) of 58% and specificity (Sp) of 93% [53], [54], [55], [56]. The Sn of the test seems to vary with the infecting Candida species, being the highest in the case of C. albicans\n[55]. A positive MN test occurs several days before radiological detection of hepatosplenic candidosis or positive blood cultures (BC) [55]. In high-risk patients, the test should be performed two to three times per week since the presence of MN Ag in blood is short-lived due to rapid clearance during each episode of candidemia with the concomitant appearance of anti-MN Ab [3].",

The test has been evaluated, mostly in ICU patients, with an overall Sn of 77% and Sp of 85% for subjects with proven or probable IFI [56], [59]. However, BDG is not species specific; therefore it is a pan fungal assay. Results of many large studies have shown that with higher values of Sn (81.4%) and Sp (78.1%), extremely low value of diagnostic odds ratio (15.5%) have been obtained and BDG concentration vary in IFI due to different fungal species. White et al. proved that BDG concentration for proven/probable IFI (209 pg/mL) is significantly higher then in possible/suspeced cases and control population (73 pg/mL) and it is different regarding the cause of IFI. BDG is useful for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, invasive candidosis and P. jirovecii pneumonia, but BDG concentration vary based on causative agents [60]. Additionally, positive BDG in the cases of P. jirovecii pneumonia cannot distinguish infection from colonization, to promote the higher sensitivity BDG concentration of 45 pg/mL has to be considered as positive, but only concentration threshold of 300 pg/mL increased specificity. The interpretation could be only with additional clinical, radiologic examination, immuno- or molecular assays [61], [62]. The test should be applied twice weekly and a single positive test is indicative of infection. True positive cases usually show falling BDG titter that eventually becomes negative in patients responding to antifungal treatment, a trend that cannot be observed in patients who does not respond to therapy.",

The PNA-FISH uses fluorescent-labelled probes to target species-specific rRNA sequences in a high Sn and Sp fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. The probes bind to the target RNA tightly, without electrostatic repulsion from the charged RNA backbone and since rRNA is amplified in viable cells of growing cultures, there is no need for its further amplification [70], [74], [75]. Cell lyses, usually used for isolation of genetic material, are also not necessary since the PNA probes hybridize to rRNA inside the bacteria or yeast enabling the whole cell analysis. The assay requires only limited sample preparation as cells do not need to be lysed to isolate genetic material, allowing a simple test procedure with visual results that match Gram-stain morphology [70], [73].",

The PNA-FISH method requires only microscope equipped with a fluorescent lamp and dual band filters for results interpretation. The accuracy and Sp of PNA-FISH can significantly affect antibiotic and antifungal utilization, allowing more targeted therapy, reduction of treatment duration, with an overall reduction in healthcare costs and increased benefit for patients [70], [74].

PCR, as one of the most popular molecular diagnostic techniques in clinical microbiology at this moment, has been reported as a valuable tool for detection of P. jirovecii in different non-invasively and invasively collected clinical samples from the respiratory tract [79]. In addition, a newly developed, improved version of the PCR assay \u2013 real-time PCR has contributed to a significant reduction in turnaround time (results are available after 2.5 h including DNA extraction) and an overall increase in diagnostic sensitivity compared to IFA [83].

Also, in patients with non-productive cough suspected of having P. jirovecii pneumonia, induced sputum is not easy to obtain [79]. It is important to emphasize that, although highly sensitive, negative PCR results of BAL fluid do not provide reliable exclusion of P. jirovecii pneumonia given that the false negative results can occur when mutation at position 210 (C210T) of the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA) gene of P. jirovecii is present [89].

This method is characterized by minimal invasiveness and includes PCR detection of cell-free DNA, fragments of DNA which are present extra cellular in different body fluids, in serum samples [90]. The pioneering experimental studies have shown that diagnostic sensitivity of PCR detection of P. jirovecii DNA in sera may vary from 0\u2013100% [90], [91]. However, the most recent study has shown that, when compared with GMS staining as the gold standard, the sensitivity of cell-free DNA PCR is the same as BAL fluid PCR and sputum PCR, while the specificity is much higher [79]. When above mentioned studies are analyzed together, it can be concluded that diagnostic performances of PCR on serum DNA depend largely on the amount of sample used for DNA extraction, DNA extraction method (magnetic bead methods are more efficient in serum cell free-DNA extraction than Proteinase K-phenol-chloroform) and the type of primers used for detection of Pneumocystis [Pneumocystis heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene has higher sensitivity and specificity in Pneumocystis detection than Pneumocystis mt LSU rRNA gene] [79], [90], [91].",

Diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is traditionally based on the isolation of fungi of the genus Aspergillus in culture in combination with CME or radiographic findings [95]. However, the sensitivity of culture is low and may take a long time to results. Besides, cultures are incapable of differentiating between infection, colonization, or contamination. On the other hand, ME, as inexpensive and easy-to-perform complementary diagnostic method, improves positive predictive value by confirming positive culture results and provides information about the infecting cell morphology, the state of infected tissues, and biofilm formation, but is not organism specific [41]. Immuno assays which are based on the detection of fungal cell wall biomarkers, such as BDG or Aspergillus GM, have significantly reduced turn-around times compared with ME, but it has been shown that they can be low sensitive and specific in certain patient groups [95].",

Currently, PCR is the most widely applied molecular diagnostic test, which enables amplification and detection of extremely low concentrations (from 1 to 10 pg) of Aspergillus DNA in various clinical specimens such as BAL fluid, serum, plasma, whole blood and biopsy material [94], [96]. Also, PCR assays can quickly identify species within the genus Aspergillus from cultures and non-cultured samples which is of great significance for epidemiologic studies and clinical practice given the fact that newly described species such as Aspergillus lentulus and Aspergillus calidoustus have been shown to have elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to several antifungal drugs, including azoles [95]. Due to the lack of standardization and potential false-positive results, PCR was in 2002 excluded from European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions [97]. In 2015, a group of experts conducted an investigation in which Aspergillus PCR was compared with GM and BDG and, based on obtained results; they concluded that \u201cPCR is now mature enough for inclusion in the EORTC/MSG definitions\u201d [98].",

            "text": "Moreover, it has been noted that the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis can be excluded if consistently negative results are obtained during the testing of multiple blood samples [98]. Conducted meta-analyses have shown that Aspergillus PCR on blood samples achieves Sn ranging from 77 to 88% and Sp from 75 to 94.1% [63], [93], [99]. When different fractions of blood are compared, meta-analysis showed that PCR assays of whole blood are more Sn (86% vs. 76%), but less Sp (73% vs. 85%) than those of sera. However, this difference is not statistically significant [93]. On the other hand, another study which included hematology patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis reported the highest diagnostic Sn (91%) of Aspergillus PCR testing of plasma in comparison with PCR testing of serum (80%) and whole blood (55%) [100]. This disagreement in the results of two above mentioned studies can be due to the differences in sample processing and prolonged specimen storage methods for the whole-blood specimens used in the second study [95]. In high-risk patients, at least two positive whole-blood PCR specimens per patient may dramatically increase Sp to 95% with positive predictive value of 90%, which is very indicative for invasive aspergillosis. However, this approach significantly decreases Sn to 64%, which indicates that this diagnostic strategy is more valuable as a confirmatory tool than as a screening tool [93]. Another factor that may also affect the Sn of PCR testing is current immunological status of the patient. In the study, which examined diagnostic performance of PCR analysis of sera obtained from neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients, it was shown that this testing modality has higher Sn in neutropenic patients (82.1%) than in non-neutropenic patients (62.5%), but without statistical significance. Likewise, the same study noted that the initial level of Aspergillus DNA is highly predictive of the 90-day mortality rate (below 150 copies/mL\u2013low probability; above 150 copies/mL\u2013high probability), which is of great significance for identification of patients who may benefit from more intensive care [96]. Finally, based on all of the above facts, it can be concluded that PCR analysis of serum or plasma seems to be diagnostic modality with acceptable Sn and Sp. Also, these sample types, as opposed to whole blood, do not require preanalytical cell lysis steps and allow other biomarker diagnostic tests, such as GM, to be run [93], [95].",

Based on the results of conducted meta-analysis, the pooled Sp of PCR on BAL fluid specimens was even 94% for proven/probable invasive aspergillosis, while Sn was 79% [101]. However, one of the major limitations of PCR testing of respiratory samples is the inability to differentiate airway colonization from invasive disease. Also, the risk of sample contamination at the patient's bedside or in the laboratory by airborne spores is high which may lead to the occurrence of false positive results. Furthermore, it is estimated that even 25% of BAL samples from healthy subjects would be falsely positive after molecular testing which is significantly higher than in other diagnostic modalities (e.g. detection of GM) [94]. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection of high fungal burdens may be indicative of invasive aspergillosis, but this diagnostic modality has still many limitations [95].",

            "text": "In recent years, resistance to azoles in A. fumigatus has emerged as a global health problem [102]. Based on published results of conducted studies, the resistance occurs as a result of TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A mutations in the cyp51A gene and its promoter region [103]. These mutations were first found in the Netherlands in 1998 (TR34/L98H) and 2009 (TR46/Y121F/T289A) [102] and have since been reported in multiple European countries, Middle East, Asia, Africa, Australia and the United States [104]. Azole-resistant invasive aspergillosis is difficult to diagnose using traditionally culture-based methods given that Aspergillus cultures are negative in the majority of patients. On the other hand, immunoassays, which provide detection of fungal cell wall biomarkers, are unable to identify patients with azole-resistant disease [102]. Consequently, two commercial multiplex real-time PCR assays (MycoGENIE\u00ae (Ademtech, Pessac, France) and AsperGenius (PathoNostics, Maastricht, the Netherlands)) have been developed to enable the detection of both A. fumigatus DNA and the most prevalent cyp51A mutations responsible for azole resistance in clinical samples. These assays have been evaluated using BAL fluid and serum samples. The AsperGenius\u00ae multiplex real-time PCR test includes two PCRs \u2013 the species PCR and the resistance PCR. In respiratory samples, the species PCR generated theSn and Sp of 88.9% and 89.3%, respectively, in patients with hematological disorders, while the resistance PCR was able to detect resistance-associated mutations in a culture-negative patient with invasive aspergillosis. As for the serum samples, species assay showed the Sn and Sp of 78.6% and 100%, respectively in patients in whom fungal disease status had been previously defined using the revised EORTC criteria [105], [106], [107]. On the other hand, MycoGENIE\u00ae showed theSn of 92.9% and Sp of 92.9% for detection of Aspergillus DNA in respiratory samples, while in serum samples, the Sn and Sp were 100% and 84.6%, respectively. It is important to emphasize that all isolates harboring the TR34/L98H mutations were accurately detected [108].",

Because of similar clinical symptoms, signs and possible simultaneous presence of several different agents, the differential diagnosis of these infections includes a large number of potential agents, which are clinically indistinguishable. Use of molecular panels allows timely detection and discrimination of the infecting pathogens, which is important to optimize medication, prevent secondary spread of infection and unnecessary antibiotic use in viral infections, and may help in decisions regarding hospitalization and infection control measures. Also, these panels include internal control for monitoring of every procedure step [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116]. In medical mycology, the use of multiplex PCR for pathogens detection implies panels for detection of yeasts in blood of patients with sepsis and panels for Cry. neoformans detection in CSF of patients with meningitis/encephalitis. Characteristics of these molecular panels are shown in the Table 3\n.",

On the first place, MALDI-TOF MS Sepsityper Kit\u2122 can be used to directly analyze positive BC in real time and to provide definitive species identification within 20 to 60 minutes, with the identification rate of 85.5% [129]. The MALDI-TOF has the advantage of rapid turn-around time and ability to identify a large number of microorganisms directly. Disadvantages include the high start-up costs associated with the purchase of mass-spectrometry equipment and training of personnel. As an alternative to MALDI-TOF, Film Array Blood Culture Identification (BCID) Panel (Bio Fire, USA), a multiplexed PCR based diagnostic test, can be used for positive BC. The BCID can detect 19 bacteria, five Candida spp. and three antimicrobial resistance determinants (mec A, van A/B, bla-KPC) in 1 h from the time of BC positivity [69]. This method has a several advantages: the large number of targets can be evaluated in a single test and all steps of the assay, from nucleic acid extraction to interpretation of amplification data, are performed in closed system and using a single pouch on a minimally processed clinical sample. The required laboratory procedures are not technologically complex and can be performed by persons who do not have training in molecular techniques [117]. Other methods such as Nano particle Probe Technology (Nucleic Acid Extraction and PCR Amplification) and Nano sphere's Verigene can be used for identification. The platform consists of two assay panels: the BC-GP assay and the BC-GN assay. Also it can detect drug resistance markers such as: mec A, van A/B, KPC, NDM, CTX-M, VIM, IMP and OXA genes [69].",

The first researches in this field have pointed out the fact that the sensitivity of MS-DS (with application of the higher cutoff) is higher than that of MN or BDG detection. In addition, neither neutropenia nor bacteriemia have been shown to influence the detection of fungal disaccharide DD in patients with IC. Also, this method has provided earlier positive results than other tests on the first serum samples in the cases of IA. Moreover, results of evaluation of this method suggest the possibility of panfungal analyses and diagnosis of IMI for which currently there are no available commercial serological tests that are efficient for the diagnosis.

On the other hand, non-established accurate identification of fungal pathogens that cause SFI can influence failure in implementation of appropriate anti-epidemic prevention measures. In the era of large number of commercial rapid tests, clinicians must decide which of them should be introduced to the routine work, based on an individual experience, consideration of the disease incidence in the population, the cost-effectiveness and finally adequate assessment and selection of patients who would have the most benefit from rapid treatment.",
