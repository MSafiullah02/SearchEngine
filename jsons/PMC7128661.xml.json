Therefore, Lei Fang and colleagues have speculated that this could be related to the use of drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazolidinediones, or ibuprofen, which cause an increase in the cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), that has been recognized as the target to which the virus bind to cells, and suggest a treatment adjustment to modulate ACE2 expression, using the antihypertensive calcium channel blockers as alternative (2).",
