This impairment is believed to be due to pain associated with the DJD as mobility appears to be increased when pain relief is provided (Gruen et al., 2014, Gruen et al., 2015, Lascelles, 2010). The approach to pain management can be divided into two basic approaches \u2014 to try analgesics known or thought to be effective in other conditions or other species, or to base the analgesic selection on a rationale evaluation of the neurobiological changes present in the target disease state in the target species. This latter approach could be described as making rationale analgesic choices on the neurobiological signature of the pain. Presently, nothing is known about the neurobiology of feline DJD pain.",

They reported differences in gene expression levels for some of these genes when they compared affected and unaffected dogs, but did not relate the findings to the presence of pain \u2014 an important consideration given that common measures of disease, such as radiographic features, do not correlate well with pain levels. Other investigators have evaluated the changes in gene expression in canine osteoarthritic cartilage (Clements et al., 2006, Clements et al., 2009), but again, the results were not evaluated against whether or not there was a pain state present.",

In this study, we first evaluated a panel of potential housekeeping genes to identify the most stable reference genes in DJD and healthy cats in DRG and dorsal horn as this had not been previously done. After the most stable reference genes were identified, a selection of genes previously associated with nociception in rodent models, and of interest to the authors, were examined using qPCR in the same samples to allow us to start characterizing the neurobiological signature of pain associated with DJD in cats. Identification of stable reference genes in pain-related tissues in felines is important because of the cat\u2019s use as a potential animal model for human conditions and the prevalence of aging cats in veterinary medicine.",

Fourteen domestic cats euthanased at a local animal shelter, and of known pain status via pre-euthanasia examinations, were used for sample collection. The investigators evaluated the cats prior to euthanasia to determine whether they had pain associated with hind limb joints. Cats were euthanased with an overdose of barbiturates for reasons unrelated to this study (population control) and the investigators had no input into which cats were euthanased. Immediately after euthanasia orthogonal digital radiographs of the lumbar axial skeleton and appendicular joints of the hind limbs were performed and evaluated for the presence of radiographic signs indicative of naturally occurring DJD as described previously (Lascelles, 2010). The tarsus, stifle and hip joints were opened and visually inspected for evidence of macroscopic lesions indicative of DJD as described previously (Freire et al., 2011) and scored as described previously (Lascelles et al., 2010). The spinal canal from the last thoracic vertebrae to the sacrum was opened and evaluated for macroscopic lesions indicative of intervertebral disc degeneration with disk prolapse and spinal cord compression. In summary, cats were considered \u2018pain positive\u2019 if there were signs of discomfort on manipulation of hind limb joints; there was gross evidence of DJD in those joints; there was muscle atrophy in the hind limbs that was not seen elsewhere in the body; and there were no grossly visible indications of intervertebral disk prolapse or spinal cord compression.",

Dissection was performed using a dissecting microscope (Olympus SZX16, 0.7x\u201311.5x). Looking at the transverse cut surface of the spinal cord, the white and grey matters can be differentiated and the dorsal horn can easily be identified. The dorsal and ventral aspects of the spinal cord are identifiable by location of the ventral median fissure and the cranial and caudal aspects are determined by looking at the orientation of the nerve rootlets. The dura mater was opened and the spinal cord was divided into right and left segments following the ventral median fissure. Another cut placed just dorsal to the central canal allowed the dorsal horn to be separated from the ventral. This cut was performed carefully to assure separation by identification of the grey matter corresponding to the dorsal horn on the transverse cut surface of the spinal cord (Supplementary Figs. S1\u2013S4). The same DRG and DH segments of the spinal cord were sampled in normal cats for comparison. All tissue samples were stored in RNAlater (Qiagen) at \u22124 \u00b0C for 24 h and at \u221220 \u00b0C thereafter until sample processing.",

The selected genes were as follows: acid sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3); activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3); calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP); cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2); chemokine (C-X3-X motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1); sodium channel, voltage-gated, alpha subunit types IX (NAV1.7), X (NAV1.8) and XI (NAV1.9); nerve growth factor (NGF); tachykinin receptor 1 (NK1R); substance P (TAC1); tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1); and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TRKA).

They were also chosen because of therapeutics that are available, or in development, or because of their involvement in neuropathic pain states. mRNA levels of CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine, were higher in the DRG of DJD-affected cats, suggesting that these cats were experiencing a neuropathic pain state (Clark & Malcangio, 2014). In studies examining changes in gene expression in DRGs, the expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is increased in the DRG after peripheral nerve injury (Shortland et al., 2006) and more recently has been shown to be increased also in models of OA in rodents (Thakur et al., 2012). ATF3 is considered indicative of neuronal-damage and neuropathic pain. Similar results were identified in the DRGs isolated from the DJD-affected cats used in this study, where the expression of ATF3 was increased 1.6-fold, and further suggests that cats with DJD may be experiencing neuropathic pain like states.",

In many experimental pain models the expression of COX2 has been found to be increased in the spinal cord in response to inflammation and injury (Vardeh et al., 2009) and contributes to pain, but we did not observe a significant difference in COX2 when we compared DJD and healthy samples. The transcription factor ATF3 has been shown to negatively regulate COX2 levels during acute inflammation in mice (Hellmann et al., 2015) and our results may indicate the same negative regulation is occurring in cats with DJD-pain. However, it is important to remember that our results reflect a single cross-sectional chronic time point. The mechanisms of pain likely change over time, and the time course of the rodent models tends to be very short, and may not reflect mechanisms at later stages of the pain state. However, considering again our findings around COX2, investigators have struggled to show clinical benefit of NSAIDs in cats with DJD-associated pain (Gruen et al., 2015).",

Studies in rodents have shown that CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 are an important signaling pathway involved in microglial contributions to chronic pain. Interestingly the fractalkine protein is membrane-bound until it is cleaved by different proteases, including cathepsin S. The cleaved, soluble form of fractalkine is associated with neuropathic pain, not the membrane-bound form (Clark & Malcangio, 2014). We also found NGF to be significantly differentially expressed in DH, but not in the expected direction of that reported in other pain models. Interestingly, in a study of a monoclonal antibody to nerve growth factor (anti-NGF mAb) (Gruen et al., 2016), the anti-NGF mAb produced robust and long-lasting improvements in activity and mobility, presumably due to a decrease in pain.

            "text": "Taken together, our results do point to increased expression of genes considered to be involved in neuropathic pain, and may be evidence of a neuropathic like pain state in cats with DJD-associated pain. We expected that several of the genes we selected (which have all been shown to play a role in pain in rodent models of arthritis) would show altered expression between the DJD-pain and healthy groups. There are several reasons for the relative lack of change across the genes we selected. Rodent models are just that \u2014 induced models, and these models may not reflect the neurobiology of pain in naturally occurring pain states. Indeed, this is one of the reasons that has been suggested for the lack of translation of basic pain research into effective new therapeutics (Lascelles et al., 2018). Another aspect of our study that should be factored into the interpretation of the results is that the tissues we collected contained varying types of cells and indeed tissue, and so we cannot directly infer that changes or lack of changes are due to any particular tissue type. We made every attempt to only use cats that definitely had DJD-pain or were healthy, however, we did not have detailed history on each cat, and our pain status was simply designated as \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Future studies should endeavor to collect tissues from more highly phenotyped animals (with respect to pain status). This is particularly important as the neurobiology of pain probably varies over time and with features of the phenotype (e.g. excessive sensitivity present or not). The lack of changes in our study may reflect an underpowered study and the heterogeneity of the samples assessed. Despite the shortcomings, we believe our study points to the need to look more closely at the naturally occurring pain states and such investigations may lead to novel therapeutic targets. However, there is a danger of missing novel, relevant targets if the starting point is already biased to what is known from rodent models, as our study was.",
