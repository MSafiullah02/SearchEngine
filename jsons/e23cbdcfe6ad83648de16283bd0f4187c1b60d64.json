            "text": "We propose an additional intervention that would contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, offer more protection for people working in essential jobs, and help guide an eventual reopening of society. The intervention is based on: (1) testing every individual (2) repeatedly, and (3) self-quarantine of infected individuals. Using a standard epidemiological model (SIR), we show here that by identification and isolation of the majority of infectious individuals, including those who may be asymptomatic, the reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. We replicate these observations in a more complex stochastic dynamic model on a social network graph. We also find that the testing regime would be additive to other interventions, and be effective at any level of prevalence. If adopted as a policy, any industrial society could sustain the regime for as long as it takes to find a safe and effective cure or vaccine. Our model also indicates that unlike sampling-based tests, population-scale testing does not need to be very accurate: false negative rates up to 15% could be tolerated if 80% comply with testing every ten days, and false positives can be almost arbitrarily high when a high fraction of the population is already effectively quarantined. Testing at the required scale would be feasible if existing qPCR-based methods are scaled up and multiplexed. A mass produced, low throughput field test kit could also be carried out at home. Economic analysis also supports the feasibility of the approach: current reagent costs for tests are in the range of a dollar or less, and the estimated benefits for population-scale testing are so large that the policy would be cost-effective even if the costs were larger by more than two orders of magnitude. To identify both active and previous infections, both viral RNA and antibodies could be tested. All technologies to build such test kits, and to produce them in the scale required to test the entire worlds' population exist already. Integrating them, scaling up production, and implementing the testing regime will require resources and planning, but at a scale that is very small compared to the effort that every nation would devote to defending itself against a more traditional foe.",

Currently, the virus is present on all continents, growing rapidly in Europe and the USA, and is a major threat to world order. It now seems likely that unemployment in most countries will exceed the levels reached during the depth of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Detailed models of the epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 are available that take into account population structure, and can provide estimates of the magnitude and duration of the peak of infection (www.naherlab.org/covid19 and Ref. 2 ).

Because of the exponential nature of epidemics, the outcomes are nearly binary. Even when R0 exceeds one by only a small amount the disease spreads at an accelerating pace, whereas as soon as R0 falls just below one it rapidly collapses. These two outcomes correspond to two distinct strategies for epidemic control, suppression and mitigation, close variants of which are currently attempted by several Asian countries (with different political systems) and Western democracies, respectively.",

This could (but is not guaranteed to) lead to \"herd immunity\" (see, for example Refs. 3, 4 ), which would limit spread in future epidemics caused by variants of the same virus. However, exponential processes are notoriously difficult to control, particularly in the absence of accurate real-time data and when the effect of policy changes is uncertain. The choice is stark: allowing the disease to spread to a large fraction of a population, however slowly, greatly increases the total number of infected people and would cause a loss of life that most societies will not accept. Furthermore, given the difficulties in controlling exponential processes using limited information, even a strongly enforced mitigation strategy runs the risk of overwhelming the health care system and significantly increasing the mortality rate due to the failure to treat every patient optimally (primarily due to the lack of intensive care capacity and sufficient numbers of ventilators). If the healthcare system is overwhelmed, patients must be triaged as in wartime, potentially for extended periods of time.",

The suppression model might first wreck the economy and then as public pressure forces a relaxation of control, the virus re-emerges. For many months, both approaches are likely to force a large fraction of the population into quarantine. This is because of the large number of asymptomatic carriers of covid-19; in the absence of population-scale testing, the measures need to be implemented in an indiscriminate manner, affecting the whole population. Over time, this will result in severe and unequal economic deprivation. Our estimate is that in the United States, GDP per capita is already lower by about 1000 USD per month. Redistribution can offer some protection for the most vulnerable families, but if a loss of income of this magnitude persists for six or twelve months, it could generate a backlash against the social distance measures that are currently our only weapon for fighting the disease. As a result, epidemiologists are giving serious consideration to scenarios that alternate between lockdown and relaxation that will lead to more loss of life and add to even more economic uncertainty.",

It is not a feasible strategy for suppressing the virus in the current, higher prevalence conditions faced by most countries because it would demand resources that would overwhelm any health department. In addition, the TTQ approach suffers from its own instability. Unless it identifies every single person who becomes infected, asymptomatic individuals that are not identified will generate clusters that will not be detected until someone develops a severe infection that requires medical care. If only 10% of cases are severe enough to be tested after two weeks, a single missed case will lead to an average cluster of 100 new cases before it is found. As a result, once the rate of new cases exceeds the capacity of tracing, even briefly, the epidemic runs out of control and the exponential dynamics make it almost impossible to catch up without imposing a lock-down.",

When someone tests positive, ask them to self-quarantine and provide them public assistance that reduces the burden this imposes on them. This approach relies on a key observation that has not been widely appreciated, namely that what matters is the fraction of all individuals that are identified and quarantined. It follows that testing a small number of individuals with a highly accurate test can be much less effective than testing everyone with a less accurate test. In fact, there is a quantifiable relationship between the reproduction number of a virus, and the efficiency of a population-scale testing strategy that brings the effective reproduction number below 1.

The offsetting disadvantage is that it is a challenge to test at the required scale, but this is not as difficult as it might at first seem. It could be implemented using mass distribution (e.g. regular mail) without returning samples to a central testing site. In fact, the tests required do not even have to be properly \"diagnostic.\" They will not be the basis for any decision about medical care. They only influence the decision to self-quarantine. In the worst case, they may cause people who are not infectious to be quarantined, but this is already true for most people (including the authors) in the baseline lockdown scenario. This is an important feature, as it relaxes the demands on the quality of the test. The test can tolerate many false positives, because the result of a provisionally positive test is that someone self-quarantines for two weeks when they did not have to. False negatives are also acceptable as long as people are retested frequently.",

Furthermore, building a test that could be applied at population scale is clearly feasible using current technology. It could be based on detection of antibodies to the virus 9 . However, as it takes time for antibodies to build, the antibody-test cannot detect cases early. A single test also does not discriminate between current and past infection. Making sure that someone is not currently infected requires that an antibody test is performed twice over a period of three weeks, during which the individual must be held in strict quarantine. Alternatively, the test can be combined with an RNA or antigen test. Despite these drawbacks, an antibody test will clearly be part of the solution, as it can detect immune individuals that can continue to work safely in health care or with risk groups. However, in countries where the epidemic is successfully suppressed, the fraction of immune individuals is far too small (e.g. 1-10%) for restoring normal levels of economic activity. Furthermore, deploying antibody test at a population scale will be more difficult than using an RNA test, as the current approach requires blood samples, which decreases compliance and makes self-testing more difficult.",

Technically, few measurements are easier and/or cheaper in biochemistry than determining whether a particular RNA species is present in a particular sample. The main technical concern relates to false positives caused by contamination of input samples by the amplified DNA from previous tests; this can be simply prevented by well-established procedures. Despite the technical simplicity, detecting viral RNA in the field at populationscale is difficult to achieve using the same design and strict regulatory framework that is used for tests designed for medical diagnostic purposes. Current diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 are qRT-PCR assays that require (1) nasopharyngeal swab collected by a trained nurse, (2) sample collection in viral transport media, (3) RNA purification, (4) reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. The test is highly accurate, and the total cost is in the order of $100. Such highly accurate testing is critical for accurate diagnosis of cases in a hospital setting. However, due to the very detailed and specific regulation, specialized staff and equipment, and centralized testing facilities, such tests have proven difficult to rapidly scale above thousands of assays in each location. A distributed system of sample collection and testing could, however, conceivably be used to scale qRT-PCR to population levels, particularly when using a regional sweeping approach to limit the number of simultaneous tests needed. The capacity could also be increased 10 to 100-fold by group testing 24 , a method with a long history of use in public health that was originally designed for Syphilis tests, and now commonly also used for optimally efficient detection of defective components in industrial .

This approach is very scalable, as in principle, a single sequencing instrument that is routinely used in scientific research can report more than a billion results per day. Furthermore, in the future, a test based on sequencing 19-21 that covers many acute infections could also be used to suppress or even eradicate a large number of infectious diseases simultaneously.

The test should be as easy to use as a pregnancy test, to ensure maximal compliance. Boxes of e.g. 50 tests would be massmailed to all citizens, and a national information campaign would encourage everyone to test themselves weekly. In an infected individual, viral RNA is present at reasonably high levels in nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, and stool for up to two weeks 12 , with the greatest amounts in sputum and stool. Sputum might be the ideal source for a home test kit, given the ease of sampling. Compliance of the home testing could be increased by both rewards and penalties, and potentially enforced by adding a serial number to each test that needs to be reported together with the test result to collect the rewards. The test result can be open in such a way that the result is clear to everyone. It can also be designed so that it maintains privacy. Here, the result (e.g. resulting color, number of bars that are visible) needs to be reported together with the serial number to a central facility to get the answer and/or the cash reward. The open and private approaches can also be combined, to design a test that is open and contains an encoded part that needs to be reported to collect a reward. Such designs may complicate the approach, but would allow the healthcare system to obtain data that would facilitate monitoring of the outbreak and large-scale contact tracing. The cash rewards could also be contingent on being regularly tested. Anyone found positive would be compelled to self-quarantine, possibly under monetary or criminal sanctions, or using additional rewards for compliance. Provided that the test is sufficiently quick, testing could be performed in workplaces, or even in checkpoints exiting areas with high infection rate that are currently under lockdown.",

This test has several desirable properties: unlike PCR, it does not require temperature cycling; the readout is binary and can be achieved by simple observation; and it can start from crude samples 15 . Many other technologies also have the potential to detect viral RNA rapidly and isothermally [16] [17] [18] ; these include recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), transcription mediated amplification, nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR), rolling circle replication, and in vitro viral replication assays. Although a population-scale test does not need to be as accurate as a clinical-grade qRT-PCR test (see above), apart from a potential increase in errors due to sample collection, there is no theoretical reason why a self-test based on isothermal amplification would not achieve the false negative and positive rates that are equivalent to the current state-of-the-art methodology. Making the necessary reagents at scale is also not difficult.

It's important to recognize that in contrast to vaccine and drug development, scaling up testing does not depend on any new scientific discoveries; it is a matter of engineering and logistics only. A field test would synergize with drug treatment, as many antivirals act more effectively when they are given at an early stage of the infection. Furthermore, development of field-applicable tests needed for rapid population-level screening will have great benefits in combating epidemics in countries with less developed healthcare systems, and would also help in responding to future epidemics, or variants of the current one. The costs of mobilization of scientific and industrial resources for rapid development of such a test are considerable; however, in our opinion, they are still orders of magnitude lower than the costs of the current suppression and mitigation strategies. Although balancing collective goods such as economic activity and public health commonly involve very difficult trade-offs, we believe that such a trade-off is not relevant in this case, and that a population-scale screening policy can be implemented in such a way that will both save more lives and cause less economic and social disruption than the current approach. As there is little overlap with other industrial mobilization efforts, such as scaling up current testing regime, building of ventilators or developing drugs or a vaccine, the increased effort for the development of tests would also have very limited opportunity cost. The development of capacity for population-scale testing would also be an important and relatively inexpensive insurance against other pandemics, or re-emergence of Covid-19 once herd immunity is lost or the virus mutates to evade immunity, vaccines and/or antiviral drugs.",

The optimal strategy discussed in the preceding section, testing everyone at different times, but before they have had the chance of infecting anyone else also works optimally and collapses the epidemic over a single infectious period. However, most strategies for testing n individuals during time ttest_interval before t0 have e < 1, and are not sufficient to completely collapse the epidemic using one testing round, as e depends on the relationship between the order of testing and the order of infections. For example, using a random order of testing allows some individuals that have already been tested negative to become infected during the ttest_interval (the mutual information between test results and person being infected at t0 is less than one bit). However, some other regimens using a perfectly sensitive test can collapse the epidemic (but not always prevent all future infections): for example, a geographical sweep where infections (individuals) are prevented from crossing a moving test front can be used to identify every infected individual in the population by performing a single round of n tests.",

However, this very intuitive idea is incorrect, as collapsing an epidemic only requires that the rate of generation of new cases per current case is less than one. The limit for random testing can be obtained using the SIR model extended with testing (SIR+T), which abstracts away individuals and thus can (only) be used to investigate the effect of random, time-separated testing. Analytically from this model, as shown above, the < 1 condition is true when tests are performed at a rate that is higher than 0 \u2212 1 tests per mean infectious period. The same limit results from the following consideration: reducing 0 to less than one using the method representing the lower bound -a completely random testing regime -requires that an infected individual has less than an equal probability of (a) infecting another individual over (b) being tested and quarantined or recovering from the infection (analogously, in SIR+T, the combined testing and recovery rate needs to be higher than the rate of new infections). Events (a) can recur, but either event (b) terminates the chain. Therefore, at R = 1 there will be on average one (a) event, which requires that the order of the infectious and protective events are randomly ordered with respect to each other, with equal density. This yields 0 \u2212 1 tests and one recovery per 0 infections per infectious period, and an upper limit of 0 tests per infectious period at infinity (because as 0 \u2192 \u221e the expectation value for becomes the geometric series \u2211 2 %&",

Performing multiple tests over time imposes an additional constrain on optimality -the allocation of tests to each transmission interval. As described above, best performance of continuous testing and quarantine is thus achieved when testing is performed immediately after infection for each individual, or as requirement for exiting quarantine. Testing blood before transfusion to prevent transmission of HIV or hepatitis C, testing at border crossings, conditional opening of lockdown, or some regimes that apply contacttracing may come close to approximating this limit, which for Covid-19 is = ( \" \u2212 1)/ \" = 0.57 per mean infectious period; Fig. 2 ).

As test sensitivity decreases, the performance of the concurrent regime becomes lower than optimal. However, concurrent testing still performs well above the lower limit obtained from the random testing model. The required pc rate to bring R0 < 1 using concurrent tests has a simple relationship with the exponential growth of infectious cases. Over interval t-t0, pc > 1-(infectious cases at t0)/(infectious cases at t). However, it is not as simple to relate this to original R0, because the relationship between R0 and growth rate is a function of the distribution of the generation intervals (Ref. 28 ). Estimating at R0 = 2.4 using even probability distribution of infections over time, the infected population becomes approx. eight times larger in a single 14 day infectious period. This means that a testing regime that is regularly spaced at 14 day intervals should have pc value of > 7/8 = 0.875 to bring R0 < 1. This is confirmed using empirical simulations to assess the rate of exponential growth in the complete absence of immunity and all other types of interventions; the limit = 1 at 0 = 2.35 with testing every infectious period (14 days) is reached when \u2248 0.85 (compared to 0.58 for testing each individual directly after infection).

To account for such more complex real-world phenomena, we implemented a stochastic network model using the Gillespie algorithm for accurate numerical simulation of the stochastic dynamics. We used the seirsplus Python package (https://github.com/ryansmcgee/seirsplus), which models an epidemic on a social graph, where each individual transitions between six states: susceptible, exposed, detected-exposed, infectious, detected-infectious, and recovered. The two detected states are used to model the effectiveness of testing and quarantine, and social distancing is modelled by removing edges from the initial social graph. We used a random social graph of mean degree 13 (median 10) and two-sided exponential tails, which was reduced to mean degree 2 for social distancing (lockdown) and quarantine. The population consisted of 10,000 individuals. In both shown scenarios we assumed that the test had 80% sensitivity, and epidemic parameters were modelled loosely after COVID-19.
