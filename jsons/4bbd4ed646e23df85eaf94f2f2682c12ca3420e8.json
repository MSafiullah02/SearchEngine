To date, more than 800,000 coronavirus cases are diagnosed and nearly 40,000 deaths are reported globally. The main method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction that has its own limitation such as the amount of its sensitivity [2] . However, computed tomography (CT) images were used as the first diagnosis line in several departments, although other imaging modalities such as chest radiography, positron emission tomography (PET) and ultrasound are also recruited [3] [4] [5] .",

In diagnostic models, imaging features are used for diagnosis or improving the diagnosis. Combination of quantitative and qualitative parameters (and other parameters) will result in better diagnosis and better patient management. The radiomics features could also act as prognostic and predictive markers and used for survival and side effects of disease prediction. By delta radiomics features (changes in radiomics features due to a therapy), the impacts of treatments and their correlation with patient's outcome could be assessed. In addition, by incorporating underlying diseases into the models, better predictive power may be obtained. By finding associations of radiomics features with genomics parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 such as immunological genes, biological mechanisms of the disease could be well understood and therapeutic targets are identified.
