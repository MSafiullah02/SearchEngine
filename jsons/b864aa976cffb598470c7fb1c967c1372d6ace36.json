Because previous research has shown that patients who receive high doses of steroids can develop manic symptoms or manic syndrome [2, 3] , it has been theorized that SARS-related psychosis was caused by steroid treatment. However, other etiologies should also be considered. SARS-associated coronavirus, the pathogen involved in SARS, has been detected in CSF samples obtained from patients with SARS [4] . In addition, patients with SARS are subject to many physical and psychological stresses. Hypoxia, concomitant sepsis, sleep deprivation, social isolation (as a result of being quarantined), fear of death, and concurrent SARS infections within the family are all profound stressors that can precipitate psychosis.

Third, the patients with SARS-related psychosis were evaluated by clinical assessment rather than by a standardized research interview, such as the SCID. Last, the ret-rospective nature of this study is a key limitation. However, amidst the confusion, shock, panic, and fear associated with the SARS outbreak, it was difficult to design and launch a prospective study quickly enough to match the rapid course of the epidemic.
