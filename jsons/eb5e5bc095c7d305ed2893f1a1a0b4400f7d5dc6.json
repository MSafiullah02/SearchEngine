There is an increasing interest in the mathematical modelling literature for the spread of epidemics between discrete geographical locations (patches, or cities). Such metapopulation models incorporate single or multiple species occupying multiple spatial patches that are connected by movement dependent or independent of disease status. Such models have been discussed for an array of infectious diseases including measles and influenza, by Arino and coauthors [2] [3] [4] [5] , Sattenspiel and coauthors [14, 15] , Wang and coauthors [9, 13, 19, 20] .

This quantity serves as a threshold parameter for disease elimination; if R 0 < 1 then the disease dies out when a small number of infected individuals is introduced whereas if R 0 > 1 then the disease can persist in the population. The above mentioned works illustrate that in metapopulation models R 0 often arises as a complicated formula of the model parameters. Such models include multiple infected classes, and individuals' movement makes it challenging to compute the number of new infections generated by an infected case, and to understand the dependence of R 0 on the movement rates. To calculate R 0 in metapopulation models, the next-generation method is used (see Diekmann et al. [7] ).",

There are many reasons why individuals should be distinguished in an epidemic model by their residential statuses; visitors and local residents may have very different contact rates and mixing patterns, but more significantly, these groups are different in their travel rates because in reality, a large part of outbound travels from a city are return trips. In the above works, the basic reproduction number was calculated and its dependence on the movement rates was studied numerically. Some complicated behavior of R 0 in these parameters was highlighted in [1, 2, 4] : numerical simulations suggest that when the infection is present in same patches but absent in others without movement, then travel with small rates can allow for disease persistence in the metapopulation although higher travel rates can drive the disease to extinction.",

Note that S identifies the set of elements in K 2 that depend on m Ir 21 , and K S 2 contains elements of K 2 that are subject to change when m Ir 21 is targeted. Following the terminology of [16] it is thus meaningful to refer to S as the target set and to K S 2 as the target matrix. Note that L 2 D K 2 K S 2 , hence the condition .L 2 / < 1 implies that .K 2 K S 2 / < 1, that is, the controllability condition holds and it is possible to stabilize the DFE by controlling only the elements in S [16] .",

This general SIRS model is applicable for an array of infectious diseases, and it can also be reduced to simpler models (SIS, SIR models) by setting parameters (or their inverses) to zero. In the model setup we distinguish local residents from temporary visitors in each city, that results in four infected classes in the model. We demonstrated that controlling the movement of one or two infected groups can be sufficient for preventing a disease outbreak. It was discussed in [11] that the role of different inflow rates of residents and visitors into a city is not necessarily significant in regards of the total epidemic burden, but it is of particular importance for pandemic preparedness, when it comes to assessing the risk for each group to import the infection to a disease-free city.",

We say that a square matrix A has the Z-sign pattern if all entries of A are nonpositive except possibly those in the diagonal. If A 1 0 holds then A is a non-singular M-matrix (several definitions exist for M-matrices, see [8, Theorem 5.1]). By [18, Lemma 1] the stability of the DFE is determined by the eigenvalues of J; more precisely, the DFE is locally asymptotically stable if s.J/ < 0, meaning that all eigenvalues have negative real part, and the DFE is unstable if s.J/ > 0, when there is an eigenvalue with positive real part. The proof of the next proposition follows by similar arguments as those in the proof of [18, Theorem 2]. Proposition 2 Consider a splitting F V of the Jacobian of the infected subsystem about the DFE, where F is a nonnegative matrix and V is a non-singular M-matrix. Then, it holds that s.J/ < 0 if and only if .FV 1 / < 1, s.J/ D 0 if and only if .FV 1 / D 1, and s.J/ > 0 if and only if .FV 1 / > 1.",
