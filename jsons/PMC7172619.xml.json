HEV genome is linear, single-stranded positive sense RNA of about 7.2 kb. The genome has short 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions, a 5\u2032-methylguanine cap, a 3\u2032 poly (A) stretch, and three open reading frames ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3. ORF1 codes for viral non-structural polyprotein and contains several conserved enzymatic domains, including putative methyltransferase, papain like cysteine protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Koonin et al., 1992). ORF2 codes for viral capsid protein and ORF3 for a small phosphoprotein that gets associated with cellular membranes and cytoskeleton fractions (Zafrullah et al., 1997). ORF3 also has pleiotropic effects on host cell pathways and recently reported to have an important role in viral egress from infected cell (Ahmad et al., 2011, Holla et al., 2013). HEV has been classified phylogenetically into four major genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to humans and cause sporadic and epidemic hepatitis, mostly in developing countries. Genotypes 3 and 4 HEV are zoonotic and infect humans and wide range of animal species (International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses; Ninth Report).",

Prabhu et al., 2011 have shown increased number of CD8+T cells in the liver biopsies of HEV infected patients suggesting their role in liver damage. Impairment of HEV specific T-cell responses was shown to be associated with chronic HEV infection in immunocompromised organ transplant patients (Suneetha et al., 2012).

Silent substitutions of U at the nucleotide 3148 (in the helicase domain) and C at the nucleotide 5907 (in the capsid gene) in HEV strains of genotype 3 (comparison between 10 acute and 1 FHF case) and 4 (comparison between 23 acute and 5 FHF cases) have been documented to have association with fulminant hepatitis and disease severity in patients. C5907 was also associated with high viral loads in the infected individuals (Inoue et al., 2006, Inoue et al., 2009). Takahashi et al. (2009) have reported association of V239A mutation (in the helicase domain) (7/7 severe hepatitis cases) with increased virulence of genotype 3 virus. Similarly, comparative sequence analysis of genotype 1 sequences from acute viral hepatitis cases from India, Indian subcontinent and FHF cases from India showed sub clustering of 6/7 FHF sequences indicative of similarity in them. There were six unique amino acid substitutions in the ORF1 region of HEV sequences derived from FHF cases (F179S, A317T, T735I, L1110F, V1120I, and F1439Y) (Mishra et al., 2013). Two of these mutations L1110F (found in 5/7 FHF virus sequences) and V1120I (6/7 FHF virus sequences) were present in the HEV helicase region, between helicase motif IV and motif V. These reports suggested possible involvement of helicase domain in determining outcome of HEV infections. Present study addresses possible role of L1110F and V1120I amino acid replacements in the helicase domain of genotype 1 virus in altering enzymatic activities of the protein and replication efficiency of the virus.",

Briefly, RNA duplexes were generated by annealing in vitro synthesized, biotin labeled 38 mer RNA (binding strand) and Digoxigenin (DIG) labeled 26 mer RNA strand (release strand). The biotin ylated strand binds to the streptavidin-coated wells while the helicase catalyzes removal of DIG labeled strand. DIG-labeled strand is detected using anti-DIG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase which gives amount of intact RNA duplex after the enzymatic action. Taking absorbance thus allows indirect measurement of unwinding efficiency of the enzyme, i.e. decrease in absorbance is proportional to unwinding by the enzyme. All reactions were carried out in triplicates, in two independent experiments and mean values were taken to calculate percent unwinding activities of the helicase mutants.",

As HEV-RLuc replicon was made by inserting RLuc gene into ORF2 encoding region, RLuc expression requires subgenomic RNA synthesis. Since both Walker A and Walker B mutants showed no RLuc activity there were two possibilities (1) helicase is essential during the transcription of subgenomic RNA, (2) helicase is required at the preceding step of virus replication, i.e. ns RNA (negative sense RNA) intermediate synthesis. If second possibility is true, then it will affect synthesis of both subgenomic RNA and new genomic RNA. To see whether Mut GKS and Mut DE were able to synthesize nsRNA intermediate, RNA transfected cells were harvested at 24 and 48 h post transfection and processed for strand specific RT-PCR. There was no nsRNA synthesis at both 24 and 48 h time points in both Mut GKS and Mut DE transfected cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 5) while cells transfected with wild type HEV-RLuc were positive (Fig. 3C, lane 2).

This showed that amino acid change L1110F was complementing V1120I change, since the negative effect of V1120I was at least partially rescued in the dual mutant (Fig. 3D). Overall, luciferase activity levels of all the three mutants remained significantly lower as compared to wild type HEV replicon indicating that both FHF-E mutations in the helicase domain of the virus have negative effect on the virus replication.",

There are several studies suggesting possible involvement of viral helicases in activities other than replication. Mutations in viral helicases have been shown to alter virus replication and disease severity. A single amino acid substitution at position 249 (Thr to Pro) of the NS3 helicase region in West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported to confer a highly virulent phenotype on the viral strains otherwise weakly virulent in American crows (Brault et al., 2007). RNA helicase was suggested to be an attenuation or fitness determinant of WNV in different hosts (Ebel et al., 2011). Paired mutations in virus envelope protein and NS3 helicase domain of Dengue virus were shown to synergistically enhance RNA synthesis and viral load in human and mosquito derived cell lines (de Borba et al., 2012). Reversion of live attenuated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccine strain to virulent virus by point mutations in papain-like cysteine protease and helicase regions has been reported (Nielsen et al., 2001). There are reports showing adaptive mutations in the helicase region of HCV replicons leading to better replication efficiencies in cells (Blight et al., 2000, Krieger et al., 2001, Grobler et al., 2003).",

Characterization of viral full genomes from FHF-E cases have shown occurrence of unique point mutations in the helicase domain of genotype 1, 3 and 4 FHF-E virus strains (Mishra et al., 2013, Inoue et al., 2006, Inoue et al., 2009, Takahashi et al., 2009). Majority of human HEV infections are caused by genotype-1 virus in developing countries. This genotype is predominantly transmitted by enteric route causing epidemics in contrast to sporadic cases caused by zoonotic transmissions of genotype-3 and genotype-4 viruses in developed countries. Associations of Th1 bias and higher HEV viral load have been documented in genotype-1 hepatitis E infections leading to FHF during pregnancy (Bose et al., 2011). The present study addresses effect of two point mutations (L1110F and V1120I) in the helicase domain of viral genomes from FHF-E cases from India, on the enzymatic activities of the helicase protein and virus replication. Sequence analysis of 121 HEV isolates (genotype 1\u20134) done by Mishra et al. (2013) showed that mutation L1110F was genotype-1 FHF specific (except for one type-4 sequence from Japan). Mutation V1120I was absent in genotype-2, predominant in genotype-3, and rare in genotype-4 HEV sequences. These dual mutations were present in 5/7 HEV genomes analyzed from FHF-E cases from India. In view of knowing critical role of helicases during positive sense RNA virus replication and recent report of Bose et al. (2011), showing higher viral loads in FHF cases as compared to self limiting hepatitis E cases we hypothesized that these highly conserved mutations in helicase domain could be responsible for enhancing helicase enzymatic activities, which plausibly would change the magnitude of virus replication. To check this we developed three helicase protein mutants, two with individual point mutations and the third one with dual mutations and tested their signature biochemical activities.",

This suggested that mutations in helicase domain were not increasing virus replication efficiency and there could be alternative host/viral interactions resulting in to high viral loads in FHF-E pregnant women as noted by Bose et al. (2011). Reduced replication efficiencies of all three mutant replicons, despite having normal levels of ATPase and unwinding activities, possibly resulted due to altered interaction/s of the helicase protein with other either viral proteins or host cell proteins.
