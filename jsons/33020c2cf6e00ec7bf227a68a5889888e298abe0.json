These organisms have been isolated from amniotic fluid harvested from women with intact membranes. 16 It has been reported that vaginal colonization or amniotic infection with this organism significantly increases the likelihood of PPROM. 2, 3 Infection with Ureaplasma sp. in women is associated with increased concentrations of TNF-a in amniotic fluid 16 and experimental infection of Rhesus monkeys with either U. urealyticum or M. hominis increases the production of TNF-a in amniotic fluid. 5, 6 This cytokine has been shown in vitro to stimulate MMP-9 production by amnion 10 or amniochorion. 17 Mycoplasma pulmonis has previously been shown to increase TNF-a concentrations in amniotic fluid in experimentally infected rats. 12 Therefore, we hypothesized that genital mycoplasmas would increase in vivo production of MMP-9 in a welldefined system of intra-amniotic infection.",

            "text": "We found that MMP-9 was significantly increased in the membranes and amniotic fluids of M. pulmonis-infected dams. Although M. pulmonis is a different species than the genital pathogens affecting humans (U. parvum, U. urealyticum, M. genitalium, and M. hominis), there are many similarities in the pathophysiology of these organisms with regard to their consequences on infertility and fetal wastage. 12 Although no overt clinical effects of infection on pregnancy are observed with this model, intravenous injection of M. pulmonis into pregnant rats results in high levels of bacterial infection in amniotic fluid, placenta and endometrium as well as histological placentitis. 14 Future studies comparing the pathophysiology of infection by the intravaginal route with the intravenous route may be valuable for separating clinical from subclinical aspects of intrauterine infection. This is particularly relevant as the clinical course of genital mycoplasmosis in humans is most closely linked to clinically silent chorioamnionitis rather than febrile intrauterine infections. 18 This study suggests that increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and MMP-9 occurs during genital mycoplasmosis but this is not sufficient for induction of PPROM, preterm labor or low birthweight in this model system. During spontaneous labor in monkeys, ProMMP-9 increases as labor approaches followed by increased production of activated MMP-9 (83 kDa). 8 It is also possible that MMP-9 must be transformed to its active form in order for it to digest membrane collagen and that the enzymes which activate proMMP-9 are not increased in this model.",
