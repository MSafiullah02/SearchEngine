Binding of IFNs to their receptors activates the JAK/STAT signalling pathway with the Janus kinases JAK1, 2 and TYK2 and the signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2. Depending on the cellular setting, additional STATs (STAT3-6) and additional signalling pathways are activated. The actions of IFNs on infected cells and the surrounding tissue are mediated by the induction of several hundred IFNstimulated genes (ISGs). Since the cloning of the first ISGs, considerable progress has been made in describing antiviral effector proteins and their many modes of action. Effector proteins individually target distinct steps in the viral life cycle, including blocking virus entry, inhibition of viral transcription and translation, modification of viral nucleic acids and proteins and, interference with virus assembly and budding. Novel pathways of viral inhibition are constantly being elucidated and, additionally, unanticipated functions of known antiviral effector proteins are discovered.

IFNs induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), whereby many are regulated by all IFNs, and others are induced more selectively (de Veer et al. 2001; Der et al. 1998) . Even for several long-known ISG-encoded proteins with direct or indirect antiviral activity, the mechanisms of action are often still poorly understood. Studies on antiviral activities of specific proteins became more complicated than anticipated, largely because of their high virus-specificity and their involvement in multiple pathways, including normal cellular physiology. Moreover, viral counteracting mechanisms can be very efficient and mechanistic discoveries often depended on mutant viruses. As another level of complexity, some of the antiviral effector proteins also have proviral effects. Recognition of virus infection is a central requirement for the initiation of an efficient host defence. Molecules and signalling cascades involved have been mainly characterized during the last decade and new players are still being identified. A number of germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) sense the presence of so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PRRs involved in host defence against viruses are localized in several cellular compartments and recognize distinct molecular structures, most prominently viral nucleic acids. Activation of distinct PAMP-induced signalling cascades converge in most cases at the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs (Kawai and Akira 2009; McCartney and Colonna 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 233, "text": "(de Veer et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 234, "end": 250, "text": "Der et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1588, "text": "(Kawai and Akira 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1616, "text": "McCartney and Colonna 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "IFNs are grouped into three classes, called type I, type II and the more recently identified type III IFNs. Type I IFNs are the key cytokines for innate antiviral immunity, as they are rapidly induced upon virus recognition and act on presumably all cell types. Type I IFNs have been discovered more than 50 years ago and comprise a large group of cytokines. Among these, several distinct IFNa subtypes (13 in humans) and IFNb are induced directly in response to viral infections. Type II IFN consists of only one member, IFNg, that is mainly produced by activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (Pestka et al. 2004) . Type III IFNs are structurally more related to the interleukin-(IL-) 10 cytokine family, but have been classified as IFNs based on their similar biological activity as IFNa/b. In humans, this family has three members, IFNl1-IFNl3, originally designated as interleukin IL-29, IL-28A and IL-28B, respectively. IFNls are also directly induced by viral infections by similar, but probably not identical, mechanisms. In contrast to IFNa/b, IFNls act only on specific cell types due to cell type-restricted expression of their specific receptor chain. The latter appears to be mainly expressed on epithelial cells and thus IFNls have a more restricted/specific role in the antiviral defence (Commins et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 603, "end": 623, "text": "(Pestka et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1332, "text": "(Commins et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Signalling of type I IFNs is initiated by ligand binding to a common heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains. Ligand binding results in the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) by the receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) TYK2 and JAK1. Mainly STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers, and to a lesser extent STAT1 homodimers, are activated in response to IFNa/b. Dependent on the cell type, other STAT family members can be activated, but their impact on cellular responses is often unclear. STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers, in association with IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 9, form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and induce transcription of genes containing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in their regulatory regions. Type III IFNs utilize the IL-10R2 and the IFNlR1 (IL-28Ra) receptor chains and activate TYK2, JAK1 and mainly ISGF3. Accordingly, responses appear very similar to those induced by type I IFNs, although some differences have been reported. IFNg binds to IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 and activates JAK1, JAK2 and mainly STAT1 homodimers. STAT1 homodimers bind to IFNg activated sequences (GAS) in promoter regions of responsive genes. IFNg can also activate other STAT complexes but again, the contribution of these complexes to the overall response requires further characterization. In general, IFNa/b is mainly associated with antiviral and IFNg with antibacterial activity, but IFNg certainly also exhibits potent antiviral activity and IFNa/b impacts on the antimicrobial defence. It is important to note that in addition to the induction of an antiviral state in responsive cells, IFNs also exert important immunomodulatory activities, mainly by shaping adaptive immune responses (Borden et al. 2007; Schindler et al. 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1761, "end": 1781, "text": "(Borden et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1804, "text": "Schindler et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Several specific antiviral pathways have been reviewed recently (see below), so the emphasis herein will be on providing an overview about well-known IFN-induced antiviral pathways with a strong focus on recent developments.

It has to be mentioned, however, that there are often multiple modes of action Fig. 1 Schematic overview over antiviral effector mechanisms of IFN-stimulated gene products. Viruses use substantially different replication strategies and we therefore use the life cycle of an enveloped (\u00c0)ssRNA virus as an example (depicted in blue letters). The virus binds to its cellular receptor at the plasma membrane, enters the cell via pH-dependent endocytosis and fusion, subsequently uncoated viral nucleoproteins are transported to the nucleus, where virus replication and transcription occurs. Viral proteins are translated by the cellular machinery, core proteins assemble with the viral genome, envelope proteins are transported via the ER/Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane where virus assembly and budding occurs.

IFITM proteins have been found in proximity to the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, small vesicles, exosomes, or associated with the plasma membrane (Siegrist et al. 2011) . They have been originally identified based on their IFN inducibility, although they are also expressed at low levels in untreated cells (Friedman et al. 1984) . The antiviral potency of human IFITM1 (9-27, Ifi17, fragilis protein 2) has been first demonstrated by overexpression of IFITM1, which led to a marked decrease of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) but not influenza A virus (FLUAV) replication (Alber and Staeheli 1996) . First mechanistic insights came from a quite recent study (Brass et al. 2009 ). Using viral pseudoparticles containing the murine leukaemia virus (MLV) genome and unique envelope proteins from different viruses, IFITM actions could be linked to viral surface proteins and to early steps in viral replication. Envelope proteins from several FLUAV strains, three different flaviviruses (i.e. West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OMSK)), and VSV could confer IFITM1-, IFITM2-and IFITM3-sensitivity to pseudovirus particles, whereas no effect was observed with envelope proteins from three different arenaviruses (i.e. Machupo virus (MACV), Lassa virus (LASV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)), or MLV. Consistent with the pseudovirus particles, overexpression of IFITM1, IFITM2 (fragilis protein 3, 1-8D) or IFITM3 (1-8U, Ifi15, fragilis protein) in human cell lines results in strongly reduced replication of FLUAV. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of IFITM3 enhances FLUAV replication and decreases IFNa or IFNg-mediated anti-FLUAV activity. The effect of IFITM3 on WNV and Dengue virus (DV) replication was confirmed with overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. No effect was observed on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, supporting the notion that IFITM actions are virus-specific (Brass et al. 2009 ). Further evidence for the inhibition of flavivirus and of rhabdovirus entry and/or uncoating by IFITM1-3 has been provided using stably transfected human cell lines Weidner et al. 2010) . Very recently, the IFITM-mediated inhibition via viral entry proteins was extended to filoviruses (i.e. Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV)), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Huang et al. 2011) , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (Lu et al. 2011) . Consistent with studies in human cells, increased FLUAV replication was observed in embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice lacking the entire Ifitm locus (Table 1) (Brass et al. 2009 ). The precise mechanism of IFITM1-, 2-and 3-mediated antiviral activity is still unclear, but IFITM proteins might block virus-receptor interactions, prevent endocytosis or acidification, block fusion or induce signalling to other effector molecules. Recent evidence suggests that the inhibition occurs at late stages of the endocytic pathway. IFITM proteins do not decrease the primary attachment moieties for FLUAV (Brass et al. 2009 ) and do not affect SARS-CoV receptor expression (Huang et al. 2011) . FLUAV still localizes to lysosomal compartments upon ectopic expression of IFITM1, 2 or 3. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of IFITMs on SARS-CoV could be circumvented by addition of trypsin, which promotes fusion at or near the plasma membrane (Huang et al. 2011 ). There is also evidence for different specificities of IFITM family members. Among the murine IFITMs, IFITM3 inhibits FLUAV entry more efficiently than SARS-CoV, MARV, or EBOV, whereas IFITM5 and IFITM6 are more efficient in inhibiting filoviruses (Huang et al. 2011) . Interestingly, IFITM3 is posttranslationally modified by S-palmitoylation. Mutation of the palmitoylation site does not alter protein stability or trafficking, but prevents membrane clustering and abrogates its antiviral effect on FLUAV replication (Yount et al. 2010) . Although there is accumulating in vitro evidence for an important role of IFITM proteins in the early antiviral defence against a broad range of enveloped viruses, the contribution of IFITM proteins to the antiviral defence in vivo remains to be determined.

They all share intrinsic GTPase activity and the capacity for self-assembly. Among these four families, only the Mx proteins have well-described antiviral activities (MacMicking 2004). The Mx proteins are among the most potent antiviral effector proteins. The Mx family comprises Mx1 and Mx2 in mice, and MxA and MxB in humans. Mx proteins are 70-80 kDa in size, belong to the dynamin protein family and differ from the other IFN-inducible GTPases by their stronger induction by type I and type III IFNs as compared to IFNg. Mx1 localizes to the nucleus, whereas MxA and Mx2 are located near the smooth ER. MxB is found in the intranuclear and/or cytoplasmic face of nuclear pores and has no detectable antiviral activity. Mx1 was identified as an important IFN-induced antiviral factor in early studies with mice exhibiting a genetically determined resistance against FLUAV infection (Haller and Kochs 2011; Haller et al. 2007 ). Importantly, many laboratory inbred mouse strains, including C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and 129/J, carry non-functional Mx1 alleles due to large deletions or nonsense mutations (Staeheli et al. 1988 ). Studies employing Mx1-and MxA-transgenic mice confirmed the importance of Mx proteins for the antiviral defence in vivo. For example, constitutive expression of MxA in Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice confers full resistance to Thogoto virus (THOV), La Crosse virus (LACV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) (Hefti et al. 1999) . Mx proteins inhibit replication of a broad range of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses. The mechanism of Mx action has been extensively studied, but is still not entirely clear. Dependent on their localization Mx proteins can recognize and trap essential viral structures, the main targets appear to be viral nucleocapsids. Cytoplasmic MxA blocks the movement of FLUAV and THOV nucleocapsids into the nucleus, while nuclear Mx1 inhibits FLUAV replication prior to the onset of transcription. Mx1 and MxA associate with the viral nucleocapsids and block viral transcription. MxAmediated changes in trafficking of viral components have also been shown for LACV and African swine fever virus (ASFV). Trapping of viral structures enables Mx proteins to inhibit viral replication already at early steps of infection and provides a very efficient antiviral strategy. It is unclear how exactly Mx proteins interact with viral constituents, but recent structural insights into the basis of Mx oligomerization might help to delineate the mechanism and molecular requirements. Besides, FLUAV strains appear to differ in their sensitivity to MxA actions and this appears to depend on their nucleoproteins (Haller and Kochs 2011; Haller et al. 2007) . With respect to human populations, genetic polymorphisms in the MxA gene correlate with increased sensitivity to HCV, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and measles virus (MeV) (Cao et al. 2009; Hijikata et al. 2000; Suzuki et al. 2004; Torisu et al. 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 990, "end": 1013, "text": "(Haller and Kochs 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1032, "text": "Haller et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1225, "text": "(Staeheli et al. 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1535, "text": "(Hefti et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2730, "end": 2753, "text": "(Haller and Kochs 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2754, "end": 2773, "text": "Haller et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2942, "end": 2959, "text": "(Cao et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2960, "end": 2981, "text": "Hijikata et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2982, "end": 3001, "text": "Suzuki et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 3002, "end": 3021, "text": "Torisu et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interferon-Inducible GTPases"}, {"text": "The p65 GTPase family, also known as GBP family, consists of 11 members in mice (GBP1-11) and 7 in humans (GBP1-7).

Many inbred mouse strains have a dysfunctional allele for Gbp1 that cannot be induced by either type I or type II IFN (Staeheli et al. 1984) .

In mice and humans, alternative splicing leads to the expression of the constitutively expressed p110 and the IFN-inducible p150 isoforms. ADAR1 p150 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, ADAR1 p110 is predominantly and ADAR2 and ADAR3 are exclusively found in the nucleus.

A-to-I editing of viral RNAs can affect virus-host interactions at multiple levels and, importantly, can also have proviral effects. Nucleotide exchanges can lead to amino acid exchanges and altered protein products with different biological activities. This has for example been described for MeV, where extensive hypermutation of the matrix protein is associated with persistent infection of the central nervous system. A-to-I editing can also lead to frame-shift mutations or premature stop-codons and, consequently, to aberrant or reduced viral protein expression, as described for MeV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and LCMV (Samuel 2011) . A-to-I conversion can also induce structural changes in RNAs, as RNA duplex structures are less stable when A:uridine (U) base pairs are exchanged by I:U base pairs (Bass 2002; Serra et al. 2004) . Reduced duplex-stability likely results in altered dsRNA-mediated activities. In support of this notion, shRNA-mediated downregulation of ADAR1 leads to enhanced activation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and IRF3 (Toth et al. 2009 ). Consistently, synthetic I:U-containing RNAs suppress dsRNA-mediated activation of IRF3 and ISG expression in HeLa cells (Vitali and Scadden 2010) . A-to-I substitutions can also alter microRNA processing or silencing capacity, or target RNAs for degradation. These effects have been shown for cellular RNAs and are yet to be demonstrated for viral RNAs. It is also likely that RNA editing can lead to viral genome mutations in the case of single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses that use RNA-dependent RNA replication.

PKR consists of two N-terminal RNA binding motifs (RBMs) and a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain (KD). PKR is constitutively expressed in all differentiated cells at low levels and is upregulated upon type I and III IFN through activation of an ISRE binding site in the promoter. In uninfected cells, PKR exists as an inactive monomer by autoinhibition of the kinase domain. DsRNA and other ligands like heparin, ceramide and the PKR-associated factor PACT induce the release of the inactive molecule and lead to autophosphorylation and dimerization of PKR. Activation of PKR can also occur through binding of ssRNA containing duplex regions and a 5 0 -triphosphate. Interestingly, endogenous transcripts also efficiently activate PKR, as known for the IFNg mRNA. Once PKR is activated, it phosphorylates the serine residue 51 of eIF2a leading to inhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2b.

Dimerized PKR molecules phosphorylate eIF2a on serine 51, which inhibits the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2b. This disables the exchange of inactive eIF2a-GDP with eIF2a-GTP and leads to a block of translation initiation mRNA thereby promoting its translation.

Only very recently, extensive analyses including gene-targeted mice and mutant viruses established that the antiviral functions of IFITs depend on the 5 0 -structures of viral RNAs (Daffis et al. 2010; Pichlmair et al. 2011) . In higher eukaryotes, 2 0 -Omethylation of cellular mRNA 5 0 -caps occurs, in addition to the well-known essential methylation at the N-7 position of the cap guanosine residue, at the ribose-2 0 -O-position of one or two adjoining nucleotides (Langberg and Moss 1981) .

IFIT1 and IFIT5 (ISG58), the latter existing in humans but not in mice, directly bind to PPP-RNA, whereas IFIT2 and IFIT3 (ISG60) can associate with PPP-RNA through interaction with IFIT1.

ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to target proteins. The so-called ISGylation of proteins has many common features with protein-ubiquitination. Both involve a series of stepwise enzymatic reactions that result in covalent protein modifications (Fig. 4) . ISG15 is synthesised as a precursor protein that is processed to expose a C-terminal LRLRGG motif. The GG motif is adenylated in the presence of ATP and then conjugated sequentially to cystein residues of three enzymes (E1-E3) and, finally, ISG15 is transferred to lysine residues within its target substrates. The E1 enzyme (ISG15-activating enzyme, UBE1L) is specific for the ISGylation pathway, whereas there is an overlap with enzymes involved in ubiquitination for the E2 (ISG15/ubiquitinconjugating enzyme) and E3 (ISG15/ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. Both ubiquitination and ISGylation are reversible processes and several de-ubiquitinating and de-ISGylating enzymes can cleave off the respective protein modification. Similar to ISG15, many enzymes involved in the ISGylation pathway are induced by IFNs, e.g. the E1 enzyme UBE1L, the E2 enzyme UBCH8, the E3 enzymes HERC5 and tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), and the de-ISGylating enzyme UBP43 (USP18) (Harty et al. 2009; Zhang and Zhang 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1396, "end": 1415, "text": "(Harty et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1437, "text": "Zhang and Zhang 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 423, "end": 431, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Posttranslational Modification of Viral and Cellular Proteins"}, {"text": "Unlike ubiquitination, ISGylation does not target proteins for degradation but rather resembles mono-ubiqitination and mainly affects protein function.

Isg15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are highly susceptible to FLUAV and influenza B virus (FLUBV), SINV, HSV, and murine g-herpesvirus 68 (gMHV68) infections (Harty et al. 2009 ). Consistent with the involvement of ISGylation, Ube1l \u00c0/\u00c0 mice show increased susceptibility to FLUBV and SINV infection. In contrast, ISG15 and UBE1L are redundant for the in vivo defence against LCMV (see also Table 1 ). Very recently, the FLUAV NS1A protein was identified as ISG15 target protein in two independent studies (Tang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010 ). FLUAV NS1A protein was shown to directly interact with the major human E3 ISG15 ligase HERC5. Overexpression of HERC5 in human cell lines enhances the anti-FLUAV activity of IFNb and, consistently, downregulation of ISG15, UBE1L, UBCH8 or HERC5 by siRNA increases viral protein synthesis and replication (Hsiang et al. 2009; Tang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010) . Multiple lysine (K) residues within the NS1A can be modified by ISGylation (Tang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010) . In vitro ISGylated NS1A is unable to bind to PKR and to dsRNA and fails to dimerize via its RNA-binding domains . ISGylated truncated NS1A protein, lacking its second C-terminal nuclear-localization signal, shows impaired interaction with importin-a (Tang et al. 2010) .

ISG15 is proteolytically processed by an ISG15-specific protease to expose a C-terminal LRLRGG motif. In the presence of ATP, UBE1L catalyzes adenylation and forms a thioester bond with the C-terminal end of ISG15. ISG15 is then transferred to UBCH8, which is also covalently linked via a thioester bond. Catalyzed by HERC5 or other E3 enzymes, the C-terminus of ISG15 is then linked via an isopeptide bond to a lysine residue within the target protein.

ISGylation of these target proteins can have diverse effects, whereby it generally results in increased antiviral activity.

Notably, a HERC5 mutant protein that lacks its ligase activity does not affect IRF3 target gene-activation. Downregulation of HERC5 by siRNA results in increased replication of SeV, VSV and NDV. SeVinduced IRF3 poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is reduced upon ectopic expression of the ISGylation system.

Concerning the mechanism of action, detailed studies are only available for FLUAV infections (Wang et al. 2007 ). Viperin strongly impairs FLUAV release and, consequently, reduces virus replication in stably transfected HeLa cells. The authors demonstrate that inhibition of virus release occurs via disruption of plasma membrane lipid rafts. Viperin expression results in higher fluidity of membranes and, correspondingly, in an increased mobility of the viral haemagglutinin protein. No effect of viperin was observed in the course of VSV infection, a virus whose replication is believed to be lipid raft-independent. Additionally, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) was identified as viperin-interacting protein and overexpression of FPPS reversed the effects of viperin on FLUAV replication.

While specificity and molecular mechanisms of viral recognition are important issues, further characterization of antiviral functions of specific ISGs seems equally essential. Many studies have so far only been performed in vitro and/or in overexpression studies and it will be of particular interest how these ISGs impact on antiviral responses under physiological conditions and in vivo. This might not be trivial, as there is most likely a high redundancy of pathways and ISGs can affect viral life cycles at multiple levels. Moreover, several ISGs also exert important, but not fully characterized, cellular functions. Genome-wide association studies in human populations provide another important ongoing future direction. Genetic polymorphisms in any of the ISG loci might reveal association with virus susceptibility or other potential novel immune regulatory functions. Besides, a lot of information has been gained by studies of virus mutants. Viruses have evolved very efficient mechanisms to counteract the host immune system and further analysis from this perspective will help to decipher the multiple levels of virus-host interactions. The more detailed understanding of the exact interplay between viral and cellular factors might help to better control virus infections and to more specifically direct antiviral responses. critically reading the manuscript.
