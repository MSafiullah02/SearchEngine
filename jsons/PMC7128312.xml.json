The challenges of poor environmental conditions, poor physical state, smoking habit, alcohol abuse or illicit drug consumption significantly impair their health status. Behind the frequent association with mental disease and unintentional injuries, homeless people are also predisposed to infectious diseases, especially respiratory infections such as tuberculosis and pneumonia [1]. A high prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases was recorded in the homeless, including bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [2]. Respiratory diseases are frequently associated with death among homeless individuals [3]. Pulmonary tuberculosis is frequent in the homeless population and has been extensively studied [4], [5].",

A 50% rate of respiratory symptoms and signs was observed in this population in winter 2005 [8]. About 8.7% carried at least one respiratory virus, with rhinovirus being the most frequent when sampled during the winters of 2010 and 2011 [9]. These preliminary findings demonstrated that respiratory infections might be frequent among sheltered homeless people in Marseille, warranting further investigation.",

We hypothesize that carriage of viral pathogens may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms as it is admitted that the vast majority of respiratory infections in adults are caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and influenza viruses [10]; whereas carriage of bacterial pathogens may not necessarily be associated with clinical signs and symptoms because bacterial microorganisms that are potential aetiological agents of respiratory tract infections are also part of the resident microbiome [11]. The secondary objective was to investigate the possible association between virus\u2013bacterium co-carriage or dual bacterial infections and respiratory symptoms and signs, as the pathogenic role of respiratory viruses in virus\u2013bacterium co-infected individuals remains unclear [12] and because interspecies interactions are suspected in individuals infected with several respiratory bacteria [13].",

Shelter A has a special (day\u2013night) unit with a 35-bed capacity, dedicated to high-risk sedentary homeless people who are characterized by a high level of poverty, poor hygiene, alcoholism and mental illness. Adult homeless people were recruited on a voluntary basis. A medical doctor administered a standardized questionnaire addressing demographics, chronic medical conditions, chronic respiratory disease status (defined as suffering from one of the following conditions: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, occupational lung diseases, or pulmonary hypertension), substance abuse, vaccination status, symptoms and signs (cough, expectoration, rhinorrhoea, dyspnoea, sore throat, sibilants, rhonchi, crackles, headache, myalgia, conjunctivitis, fever) at enrolment and physically examined the participants. All participants signed an informed consent.

Among migrants, the symptom and sign prevalence was significantly higher in those visiting their country of origin compared with others. Individuals carrying at least one virus, S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae\u2013S. pneumoniae co-infection were more likely to present with at least one respiratory symptom or sign.

            "text": "The sheltered homeless population in our study was characterized by a high proportion of migrants of North African origin with a high prevalence of smoking habits and chronic respiratory diseases. We observed a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (35%) in line with the results of a survey conducted in Italy and the Netherlands [17], [18]. Dry or productive cough, rhinorrhoea and dyspnoea were the symptoms most frequently observed, suggesting that both upper and lower tract respiratory infections affect a significant proportion of sheltered homeless people during winter. We found relatively low rates of influenza virus infections. Cross sectional surveys took place when influenza was epidemic in the region of Marseille. Influenza vaccination rate in the homeless population screened in our surveys was in the same range as in Marseille's overall population [19], [20]. This result may indicate that the social isolation of homeless people might have a protective impact against community influenza virus transmission. One of the most important findings of this study is the very high prevalence of bacterial colonization by respiratory bacteria with H. influenzae (59%) and S. pneumoniae (13%) being the most frequent. A high prevalence of H. influenzae carriage (70%) was also observed by direct PCR in healthy infants from the western region of Gambia [21] and a rate of 40.9% was reported among children aged \u22646 years in day-care centres in eastern France [22]. In surveys conducted among healthy adults in the Australian Aboriginal population, the prevalence of non-typeable H. influenzae reached approximately 22.9% when culturing nasopharyngeal samples [23]. A 2.3% H. influenzae nasal prevalence was observed in Marseille's individuals originating from North Africa using quantitative PCR in 2013 [17]; however, the survey was conducted in October, which may account for a lower prevalence, as shown in another healthy Italian children population [24]. Klebsiella pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage rates have been reported to range from 3% to 15%, which is in agreement with our results [25]. This bacterium is known to be frequently multidrug-resistant [25] and further studies on drug resistance in bacteria isolated from homeless people would be of interest.",

Future studies will be conducted at least twice a year (in winter and in summer). The questionnaire design did not allow a clear distinction between acute (short-term) and chronic (going on) respiratory symptoms, which needs to be considered in further studies.
