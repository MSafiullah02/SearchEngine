            "text": "To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an 15 effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 16 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the 17 spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine 18 development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool 19 and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine 20 candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains 21 (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild 22 symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S 23 protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be 24 adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 25 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the 26 commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine 27 studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved 28 among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting 29 human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and 30 MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional 31 domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and 32 safe COVID-19 vaccine development. 33 34 35 36",

This protein is more conserved than the S protein and was reported to induce an 122 immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections 20 .

The licensed Group B meningococcus Bexsero vaccine, which was developed via 245 reverse vaccinology, contains three protein antigens 9 . To develop an efficient and safe COVID-19 246 cocktail vaccine, it is possible to mix the structural (e.g., S protein) and non-structural (e.g., nsp3) 247 viral proteins. The other proteins identified in our study may also be considered as possible vaccine 248 targets. The benefit of a cocktail vaccine strategy could induce immunity that can protect the host 249 against not only the S-ACE2 interaction and viral entry to the host cells, but also protect against 250 the accessary non-structural adhesin proteins (e.g., nsp3), which might also be vital to the viral 251 entry and replication. The usage of more than one antigen allows us to reduce the volume of each 252 antigen and thus reducing the induction of adverse events. Nonetheless, the potentials of these 253 performance of these models was evaluated using a nested five-fold cross-validation (N5CV) 294 based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, weighted F1-295 score, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. The best performing XGB model was selected to 296 predict the protegenicity score of all SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank ID: 297 MN908947.3) proteins, downloaded from NCBI. A protein with protegenicity score over 0.9 is 298 considered as strong vaccine immunity induction (weighted F1-score > 0.94 in N5CV). 299 300 Phylogenetic analysis. The protein nsp3 was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 proteins 301 of 14 coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the Uniprot (Table S2 ). Multiple 302 sequence alignment of these nsp3 proteins was performed using MUSCLE 59 and visualized via 303 SEAVIEW 60 . The phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML 61 , and the amino acid 304 conservation was estimated by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) 62 . The JSD score was also 305 used to generate a sequence conservation line using the nsp3 protein sequences from 4 or 13 306 coronaviruses. 307 308 Immunogenicity analysis. The immunogenicity of the nsp3 protein was evaluated by the 309 prediction of T cell MHC-I and MHC-II, and linear B cell epitopes. For T cell MHC-I epitopes, 310 the IEDB consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 4 out of 27 311 MHC-I reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 1.0 score 50 . For T cell MHC-312 II epitopes, the IEDB consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 313 more than half of the 27 MHC-II reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 10.0. 314",

The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were used as the seed for 114 the pan-genomic comparative analysis. The Vaxign pan-genomic analysis reported only the N 115 protein in SARS-CoV-2 having high sequence similarity among the more severe form of 116 coronavirus (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), while having low sequence similarity among the 117 more typically mild HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1.

The predicted B cell epitopes were more likely located in the distal region of 178 the nsp3 protein structure. Most of the predicted MHC-I & MHC-II epitopes were embedded inside 179 the protein. The sliding averages of T cell MHC-I & MHC-II and linear B cell epitopes were 180 plotted with respect to the tentative SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 protein domains using SARS-CoV nsp3 181 protein as a reference (Figure 3). The ubiquitin-like domain 1 and 2 (Ubl1 and Ubl2) only predicted 182 to have MHC-I epitopes. The Domain Preceding Ubl2 and PL2-PRO (DPUP) domain had only 183 predicted MHC-II epitopes. The PL2-PRO contained both predicted MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes, 184 but not B cell epitopes. In particular, the TM1, TM2, and AH1 were predicted helical regions with 185 high T cell MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes 28 . The TM1 and TM2 are transmembrane regions passing 186 the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The HVR, MAC2, MAC3, nucleic-acid binding 187 domain (NAB), \u03b2SM, Nsp3 ectodomain; (3Ecto), Y1, and CoV-Y domain contained predicted B 188 cell epitopes.

Such understanding may not 257 only provide us guidance in terms of antigen selection but also facilitate our design of vaccine 258 formulations. For example, an important foundation of our prediction in this study is based on our 259 understanding of the critical role of adhesin as a virulence factor as well as protective antigen. The is also deeply rooted in our understanding of pathogen-specific immune response induction. 262Different experimental conditions may also affect results 41,42 . Therefore, it is crucial to understand 263 the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for rational vaccine development.264 265 Methods 266 Annotation of literature and database records. We annotated peer-reviewed journal articles 267 stored in the PubMed database and the ClinicalTrials.gov database. From the peer-reviewed 268 articles, we identified and annotated those coronavirus vaccine candidates that were 269 experimentally studied and found to induce protective neutralizing antibody or provided immunity 270 against virulent pathogen challenge. 271 272 Vaxign prediction. The SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained from NCBI. All the proteins of six 273 known human coronavirus strains, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-274 OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 were extracted from Uniprot proteomes 43 . The full 275 proteomes of these seven coronaviruses were then analyzed using the Vaxign reverse vaccinology 276 pipeline 12,16 . The Vaxign program predicted serval biological features, including adhesin 277 probability 44 , transmembrane helix 45 , orthologous proteins 46 , and protein functionss 12,16 . 278 279 Vaxign-ML prediction. The ML-based RV prediction model was build following a similar 280 methodology described in the Vaxign-ML 16 . Specifically, the positive samples in the training data 281 included 397 bacterial and 178 viral protective antigens (PAgs) recorded in the Protegen database 27 282 after removing homologous proteins with over 30% sequence identity. There were 4,979 negative 283 samples extracted from the corresponding pathogens' Uniprot proteomes 43 with sequence dis-284 similarity to the PAgs, as described in previous studies 47-49 . Homologous proteins in the negative 285 samples were also removed. The proteins in the resulting dataset were annotated with biological 286 and physicochemical features. The biological features included adhesin probability 44 , 287 transmembrane helix 45 , and immunogenicity 50 . The physicochemical features included the 288 compositions, transitions and distributions 51 , quasi-sequence-order 52 , Moreau-Broto auto-289 correlation 53,54 and Geary auto-correlation 55 of various physicochemical properties such as charge, 290 hydrophobicity, polarity, and solvent accessibility 56 .
