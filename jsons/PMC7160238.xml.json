On the other hand, steroids treatment can cause symptoms of hypercortisolism, especially in patients with individual hypersensibility, or hypoadrenalism after drug withdrawal, due to hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Adrenal insufficiency could potentially increase morbidity and mortality risk. In addition, a large part of these patients is treated by antiretroviral drugs, i.e. ritonavir (RTV), which act as potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P4503A enzymes. For this reason, the co-administration of RTV and corticosteroids may enhance the exposure to the latter ones, metabolized through the CYP450 CYP3A pathway, and can prolong their half-life, causing longer-lasting suppression of HPA axis [1]. In addition, the exposure to endocrine disruptors that decrease or modify the steroidogenic activity of adrenal glands could further impair prompt recovery of adrenal function.",

Indeed, symptoms of hypoadrenalism (fatigue, hypotension, loss of weight, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) are absolutely not specific and may be confused with those caused by a severe infectious disease. Moreover, especially in these specific frail patients, steroids withdrawal can also precipitate an adrenal crisis, that represents a life-threatening complication. In this scenario, adrenal insufficiency should be suspected especially when sodium concentration is low (< 135 mEq/L), and diagnosed on the basis of morning serum cortisol levels < 80 nmol/L, or cortisol peak < 550 nmol/L after stimulation with synthetic ACTH. Cortisol measurement should be postponed at least one week after the exogenous glucocorticoids tapering and withdrawal [2].",

Although generally short term (< 3 weeks) treatment does not lead to HPA axis suppression, in predisposed individuals it can occur even after short administration, as little as 5 days, and at low doses. In a recent study, adrenal insufficiency was observed in patients taking prednisolone 5 mg per day, with mortality increase following treatment interruption [3].",
