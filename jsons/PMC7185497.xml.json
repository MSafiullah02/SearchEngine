The univariate CAR structure has been well developed, with major contributions in the field coming as early as 1974 (Besag, 1974). Excellent references on the topic include Cressie (1993) for the frequentist formulation of CAR models, and Banerjee et al. (2004) for the Bayesian formulation. These models are extremely flexible and have been used in a variety of fields, including noninfectious disease mapping (e.g., Clayton and Kaldor, 1987, Kim and Oleson, 2008, Sun et al., 2000), ecology (e.g., Lichstein et al., 2002), and image processing (e.g., Chellappa and Chatterjee, 1985), to name just a few.",

Early multivariate work was done by Mardia (1988), who proposed a very general multivariate CAR structure. Kim et al. (2001) proposed a two-fold model for mapping two correlated mortality rates. Additional work has been done by Sain and Cressie (2002), Gelfand and Vounatsou, 2003, Jin et al., 2005. A common theme among these models is that they utilize the same neighborhood structure for each of the multivariate outcomes. The model of Hossain et al. (2014) is of particular interest. It is a very general model based on the conditioning that contains many of the common multivariate CAR models in the literature as special cases. The model can be applied to data sets with more than two outcomes, but this is not demonstrated. Working directly with differing neighborhood structures is possible in their framework, but we do not know of applications of this model to differing neighborhood structures in the literature, potentially because the conditional structure makes interpretation of these results difficult.",

We prefer this model structure for modeling outcomes with respect to different neighborhood structures, as it allows asymmetric weighting between outcomes, which is one of the advantages of univariate CAR models. The application they utilize assumes the same lattice for every neighborhood structure, but the general full conditional mean structure they consider can be extended to mismatched lattices. Additionally, their formulation induces the potentially restrictive requirement that the variances of each outcome with a fixed lattice point differ by a known and fixed proportion. For many analyses, this constraint is reasonable. Expected counts or inverse weightings of the number of neighbors are often available and can be used in this regard. However, we will provide evidence that the variances are one of the most important features in this model, and we provide an extension of the model allowing the variances to be more flexibly estimated than is considered in their analyses.",

We utilize a similar mean structure, but construct our model with the goal analyzing data where lattices may be mismatched. While a change of support is often possible for mismatched lattices, this technique is not always desirable, and is occasionally impossible, as in the case where measurements do not make sense over certain regions of an areal unit. In order to analyze mismatched lattices, we will relax the variance restrictions in Sain et al. (2011)\u2019s formulation of the model. This will allow our model to perform unique inference even on matched lattices, and this is the second benefit of the structure we propose.",

As Iowa is predominantly rural, a standard CAR model which utilizes geographic borders to determine adjacency could be used to relate neighboring counties in the infectious disease process. However, it is clear from the data that cases of Mumps tended to spread along the highway system. This is an example of how multiple modes of travel and contact can spread an infectious agent. In a relatively rural state like Iowa, highway systems may serve as an important measure of adjacency for infectious disease spread, just as airline travel may be an important measure of adjancency in pandemic modeling on a larger geographical scale (e.g., Hufnagel et al., 2004).",

One of the reasons is likely that many infectious diseases are spread via human to human transmission, and the geographical proximity of two locations may not be an accurate assessment of the overall proximity of the locations in terms of disease spread. This makes a reasonable neighborhood structure difficult to construct. In the modern world, proximity is often defined by travel, rather than geographical measures. Hufnagel et al. (2004) showed that airline travel served as an accurate measure of proximity in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003. In general, it is likely that modern epidemics are spread via more than one causeway. For many epidemics, a realistic model may have to account for multiple modes of travel.",

A priori, one might expect correlation between the modes of travel, as counties that have large numbers of people traveling along highways almost certainly have large numbers of people crossing county borders unassociated with highway travel, or that there may be negative correlation due to these being competing modes of travel.

In this analysis, poverty is collected on a county lattice, and high school education is collected on a state lattice.

Our model can handle matched lattices with this requirement removed, which may be useful when a researcher is not sure how the variances of the multiple outcomes may be related, or does not want to impose rigid structure on this particular set of parameters.

These highways are only considered as part of the structure when they are multilane divided highways, as those stretches contain the most traffic. When two highways intersect, the longer highway is broken into two highway segments, with the argument being that shorter stretches of highways are more likely to be accurately modeled with the same random effect, and allows an analysis of which stretches of highway carried the highest risk of infection. It will also allow for differences in risk to be associated with interstates versus state routes, which often carry different types of traffic. This structure then consists of every multilane highway in Iowa that passes through more than two counties, yielding a highway lattice consisting of 12 stretches of highway that pass through 53 counties. The structure in this example is mismatched in two ways. First, there are 46 counties which do not have a multilane highway, and these counties are deleted from the highway lattice structure entirely. Second, Each stretch of highway is associated with two or more counties. This implies that a single highway random effect will be associated with multiple counties in our model. Specifically, there are 12 random effects associated with highways, and these 12 random effects are each associated with one of the 53 counties that contain a multilane highway.",

We wish to additionally consider the effect of highways in this process, as early cases seem to appear along highways as a primary means of spread. To assess this effect, we utilize the MMCAR structure when analyzing the final counts of Mumps in each county. This MMCAR analysis is then compared to standard CAR analyses via DIC (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). Four Poisson regression models were constructed. Model One considers two counties to be neighbors if and only if a border was shared. Because counties with initial cases (Dubuque County and Johnson County) and counties with major universities (Black Hawk County, Johnson County, and Story County) tend to have larger infection counts, these counties are modeled using a different log-mean parameter.

The prior on \u03b4 is Uniform(\u22122,0.125), where 0.125 is selected to yield the full positive support of \u03b4 given the model structure. This support follows because we assume that \u03b4 is constant in its relationship from county to highway coupled with the fact that the model requires \u2211l\u2211lj\u2243ki\u03b4klij<1 and the longest stretch of highway covers eight counties.

However, the data demonstrate longer range dependence when graphed over time. The MMCAR model can be used to test the importance of hypothesized channels of spread before undertaking the building of more complex and computationally expensive infectious disease models.

Model Three required a burn-in of 250,000 iterations and 550,000 iterations were collected from the converged chains. Model Four required a 300,000 iteration burn in period and then 900,000 iterations were selected from the converged chain. The differences in the lengths of the chains are due to differences in model complexity. Convergence was assessed via the Geweke diagnostic (Geweke, 1992), with p-values greater than 0.05 considered indicating convergence for the risk surface and variance parameters, which are the quantities of interest for inference. As is common in CAR modeling, mixing was slow between the model intercept and the mean of the random effects (Rue and Held, 2005). However, we do not wish to draw inference on these quantities, and all quantities of interest pass convergence diagnostics. Table 1\nprovides parameter posteriors for all model parameters. We see that the means and variances are very similar for Models One and Three, with the propriety parameter being lower for model Three. Model Four provides similar means, but higher latent effect variances. The propriety parameters of Model Three are more akin to those of Model One.

Additionally, it lends credence to the idea of using the MMCAR here, despite having only one outcome informing two sets of latent effects. However, the DIC of Model Four is lower than that of Model Three, the MMCAR model. This is may be due to independence in the highway and border structures. It is worth noting that previous work has demonstrated that DIC does not always select the best model in terms of risk surface prediction when performing disease mapping (e.g., Best et al., 2005, Hossain et al., 2014).

The demographic information contained within the survey is often useful in disease mapping, and an analysis of these data will show the broad applicability of the MMCAR model. We demonstrate the ability of this model to detect multiple cross correlation parameters by performing a multivariate analysis of poverty and educational attainment in the Midwest. Specifically, we are interested in accurately modeling the percent of families in poverty at the county-level and the percent of individuals 25 and older who do not have a high school education or equivalent in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

The actual model we consider isY1i=\u03bc1+u1i+\u220a1i,Y2j=\u03bc2+u2j+\u220a2j.Here, Y1i is the percentage of families in poverty in county i of the 983 county lattice (multiplied by 10 for numerical stability) and Y2j is the percentage of individuals without a high school education in state j of the 11 state lattice (multiplied by 10 for numerical stability).
