Activation of the coagulation system was found in many patients, and the degree of activation (defined as, for example, increased D-dimer concentrations at time of admission) was significantly higher in patients who did not survive than those who did survive. Overall, 21 (11%) of 183 patients died. 15 (71%) of 21 non-survivors and only one (1%) of 162 survivors met criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation during their hospital stay. In a case series from China,2 increased D-dimer concentration at time of admission to hospital (>1 \u03bcg/mL) was associated with a risk of in-hospital mortality that was 18 times higher than among those with normal D-dimer concentrations, and the authors highlighted that \u201cinadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy\u201d, among other things, might have led to poor outcomes in some patients.2\n",

Trial subgroup analyses, in which increased D-dimer concentration or admission to hospital with infection (particularly pneumonia) were incorporated as variables, show that extended thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants has benefit compared with routine in-hospital thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin.5 Finally, empirical anticoagulation has been associated with improved thrombotic event-free survival in critically ill patients with ARDS due to influenza A H1N1.3\n",
