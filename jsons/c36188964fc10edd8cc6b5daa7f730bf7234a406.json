ORFs2-6 encode four structural proteins, including the Spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and one accessory protein ORF3 Lee, 2015; Song and Park, 2012) . Among the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein plays an important role in receptor binding, cell membrane fusion and entry, and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV (Cruz et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Wicht et al., 2014) . Notably, the S gene has been frequently targeted in epidemiological studies involving phylogenetic analysis and in a number of molecular and serologic diagnostic assays for PEDV (Gerber et al., 2014a; Huang et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Park et al., 2007; Paudel et al., 2014b) .

A positive PEDV diagnosis involves the detection and identification of PEDV-specific proteins or its RNA genome in clinical samples from affected animals. Conventional PEDV diag-nostic methods are based on the detection of the virus, its nucleic acid, viral proteins or antibodies induced in response to infection. While the diagnosis of a PEDV outbreak is usually best obtained by virological detection methods, serological assays provide important information regarding previous exposure to the virus and the immune status of a given animal and/or herd.

In this study the authors evaluated five sets of primers tar- geting the M gene of PEDV. They have used a loopamp real-time turbidimeter to detect the amplification of the target sequence. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined and compared to a conventional and a real-time RT-PCR by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of a viral stock containing a known amount of PEDV. The detection limits of the rRT-LAMP and the rRT-PCR were identical with both assays detecting 10 \u22121 TCID 50 /mL, whereas the detection limit of the conventional RT-PCR was 100-fold higher (10 1 TCID 50 /mL) than the other two assays. The diagnostic and analytical sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP-based assays coupled with their low cost and efficiency make this method an alternative for PEDV diagnosis, if thermal cyclers or real-time instrumentation are not available (Yu et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 110, "end": 127, "text": "(Yu et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 994, "end": 1011, "text": "(Yu et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Isothermal amplification assays"}, {"text": "Several assays have been developed for the detection of antibodies against PEDV in serum, colostrum, milk, feces and oral fluid including indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA), virus neutralization assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) (Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015; Okda et al., 2015; Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005) . Serological assays represent important tools to evaluate antibody responses to PEDV infection, to determine prior exposure of a given herd to the virus, or yet to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines and vaccination strategies. Detection of PEDV specific antibodies is also used to assess sow immunity, which might be helpful in predicting neonatal protection. To date, only one serotype of PEDV has been identified and current serological assays for PEDV have been shown to detect antibodies against various PEDV strains, including historical and contemporary prototype and S-indel strains (Chen et al., 2016b; Lin et al., 2015) . Notably, cross reaction between hyperimmune serum generated against TGEV strain Miller and four strains of PEDV was observed in IFA assays; however, no cross neutralizing activity was detected (Chen et al., 2016b; Lin et al., 2015) .

The IFA assay presents specificity comparable to ELISA and FFN assays and has the advantage of being less time consuming and easier to perform (Lee, 2015) . IFA can also be used for qualitative (positive or negative) or quantitative (antibody titer) evaluation of PEDV-specific antibodies in serum. To determine the titers of antibodies, serial two-fold dilutions of serum are incubated with PEDV infected cells, and the antibody titers are determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum in which specific fluorescent signal is observed. PEDV-specific antibodies are first detected by IFA by 7-14 days post-exposure, and titers seem to be maintained for at least 43 days pi when a decline in the detectable levels of antibodies is observed.
