This has proved to be a fruitful advantage of SLIT over subcutaneous immunotherapy, in allowing our patients to adhere to allergen immunotherapy. As reported in a recent article,3 allergen immunotherapy should be temporarily discontinued during an active infection and this further adds value to SLIT because this practice is more malleable than subcutaneous immunotherapy.",
