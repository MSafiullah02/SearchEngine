In preparation for an anticipated influenza pandemic, a substantial body of literature has developed over the last few decades showing that the short-range aerosol route is an important, though often neglected transmission path. We develop a simple mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission via aerosols, apply it to known outbreaks, and present quantitative guidelines for ventilation and occupancy in the workplace.",

Contact tracing of COVID-19 outbreaks points to aerosols as a possibly dominant mechanism of transmission since most outbreaks occur in closed environments, while they are rare in environments which disfavor aerosol transmission (e.g., outdoors) [10] . Furthermore, infection via inhalation of aerosols and small droplets dominates large droplet exposure in most cases for physical reasons linked to complex, but well understood fluid dynamics [11, 12, 13, 14] . Despite this fact, there is a common misconception that aerosol transmission implies efficient long-range transmission (as in measles), and thus that the absence of long-range transmission implies an absence of aerosol transmission. The truth is more nuanced, and includes the possibility of a dominant shortrange aerosol path limited by pathogen dilution, deposition, and decay [15] .",

The infection probability is fairly large despite the tiny nominal infective dose because of the non-negligible probability of the contagious individual having a high value of \u03c1 and thereby delivering D inf D 0 inf (see Fig. 1, left) . If the contagious individual delivers D 0 inf \u223c 0.02 to each of 10 susceptible individuals (i.e. an 11 person cohort), the probability of transmission to at least one person is nearly 30%: (20) where N coh in the number of people in the cohort and P inf comes from Fig. 1, right.

Using the \"random \u03c1V src N inf \" curve in Fig. 1 since these were secondary infections, we find that the probability of transmission was about 15% for each contagious passenger who disembarked. This probability is relatively insensitive to our assumptions and would only change by a factor of 2 if the dose changed by an order of magnitude (in either direction). If both infections in Naha were caused by the same contagious individual (one on the ride in, one on the ride out) it would be appropriate to use the \"random V src N inf \" probability of 60%.",

For instance, allowing all parameters to vary (blue trace) the probability of having D inf > D 0 inf is about 10%, D inf > 10 D 0 inf will happen in about 4% of cases, while 1% of cases will have D inf 100 D 0 inf .
