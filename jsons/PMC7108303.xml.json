Advantages of the TAC system included simple and easy operation; reproducible and simultaneous analyses of multiple pathogens using small sample volumes; a level of detection generally within one ten-fold dilution of individual RT-qPCR assays; a lower risk of amplicon contamination as the system is entirely closed; and unlike other multiplex platforms, the ability to modify or replace individual pathogen assay primer/probes without requiring the re-optimization and validation of the entire panel.2 However, several gaps in knowledge remained after completion of that study.2 First, the frozen, archived clinical specimens utilized were collected from various studies and locations over a 10 year period, preventing evaluation of standardized methods or establishing epidemiologic associations. Second, the total nucleic acid (TNA) extracts were diluted in order to provide sufficient volume to perform comparisons of TAC with individual RT-qPCR assays; this factor, along with the frozen storage, may have contributed to the decreased sensitivity of the TAC assay relative to the individual RT-qPCR assays. Third, in order to achieve a consensus in the amplification conditions for all deployed individual RT-qPCR and TAC assays, a higher probe-annealing temperature of 60 \u00b0C was chosen as required for optimal bacterial assay specificity, but with the potential loss in sensitivity of some viral assays designed to run at 55 \u00b0C. Loss of viral sensitivity might have biased the results toward increased concordance among falsely negative individual RT-qPCR assays and TAC assays, resulting in an overestimate of TAC sensitivity for viruses.",

            "text": "We found that the TAC assay offers a simple, sensitive, reproducible and moderate throughput system for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory pathogens. TAC assays for all pathogens were accomplished with only 20 \u03bcL of nucleic acid extract and 80 \u03bcL of reaction mix per patient sample, with card setup and run times of ~3 h, excluding sample extraction; 3 cards (up to 21 samples) could be feasibly run on a single machine in a normal workday. In contrast, completing up to 21 individual RT-qPCR reactions for each clinical sample would require 125 \u03bcL of nucleic acid extract and 420 \u03bcL of reaction mix, as well as a much greater amount of technician time, precluding throughput of even 1 clinical specimen tested for all pathogens per day. Additional advantages of the TAC assay were a combined datafile output of all pathogens tested per specimen, such that merging of results of separate RT-qPCR assays was not required; and the avoidance of pipetting errors in the multi-well plate RT-qPCR assays by the automated setup of the TAC array assay. Indeed, excellent reproducibility of all controls was maintained throughout the duration of the study.",

Kodani et al.,2 found TAC sensitivity and specificity to be 95% and 98% in a smaller test set of 192 virus-positive specimens for 9 of the same target viruses (HPIV-4 not included). Our analysis yielded similar estimates of sensitivity and specificity for each virus assay, except for lower sensitivity for adenovirus, rhinovirus, and HPIV-1 (Table 3). Part of this discrepancy might be explained by the fact that Kodani et al.,2 used an annealing temperature of 60 \u00b0C for their individual RT-qPCR assays, which may have decreased the RT-qPCR sensitivity, thus making it more concordant with any negative TAC assay results (i.e., more false negative RT-qPCR results would have increased the concordance with false negative TAC results, raising the estimates of TAC sensitivity for adenoviruses and rhinoviruses). An additional factor may be greater strain variation in adenoviruses and rhinoviruses, reducing the performance of the TAC primers/probes for those viruses when analyzed at 60 \u00b0C rather than at 55 \u00b0C. We were not able to pursue studies of the effects of adenovirus and rhinovirus strain variation and annealing temperature on the TAC assay due to limited resources.",
