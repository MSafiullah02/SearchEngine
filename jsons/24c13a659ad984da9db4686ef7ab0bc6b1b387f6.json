Antigenic studies have shown that the N protein is one of the immunodominant antigens in the CoV family. 1 The cellular immune response against the N protein of some animal coronaviruses can enhance recovery from the virus infection. Immunization with a cell lysate using a recombinant baculovirus-expressing feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) nucleocapsid protein was effective in preventing the progression of FIP. 2 To investigate the antigenic role of the N protein, we carried out a computational analysis of the N protein of FCoV strains detected in healthy and diseased cats on the basis of the primary amino acid sequences.",

Antigenic analysis of the N protein was carried out by applying several methods. Our analysis demonstrated a substantial difference between virulent and avirulent strains in the mapping of antigenic sites.

On the basis of these results, we feel that virulent It is interesting to compare the antigenic sites on N proteins with ordered/disordered regions in the amino acid sequence. The additional immunodominant site identified in the avirulent strains using the method of Kolaskar and Tongaonkar (sequence 12 TRKSCSK aa 336-342) lies in the disordered region at the border between the ordered and the disordered regions. The additional antigenic site (aa 176-181), detected using the Sette alghoritm, also falls in the disordered regions. As disordered regions are involved in molecular interaction, having the property of high specificity with modest binding affinity, the combined approach ordered/disordered regions and computational analysis of antigenic sites could be useful in the prediction of the antigenicity of the proteins.",
