            "text": "Bacteria are social organisms that engage in cooperative and antagonistic relationships with their neighbors. Many of these interactions are mediated by small signaling molecules, such as quorum sensing auto\u2010inducers, which coordinate group activities like biofilm formation and virulence gene expression (Lopez et al., 2010; Ng and Bassler, 2009). Diffusible inhibitory factors, such as antibiotics and bacteriocins, are exploited as weapons to eliminate rivals (Cascales et al., 2007, Ghequire and De Mot, 2014). Research over the past decade has revealed that bacteria also antagonize their neighbors through direct delivery of protein toxins (Willett et al., 2015; Souza et al., 2015; Whitney et al., 2017; Vassallo et al., 2017). This phenomenon was first discovered as \u201ccontact\u2010dependent growth inhibition\u201d (CDI) between different strains of Escherichia coli (Aoki et al., 2005). CDI is mediated by a subfamily of type V secretion systems (T5SS) that are widely distributed throughout proteobacteria, fusobacteria and negativicutes (Aoki et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Willett et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2017). T5SS/CDI+ bacteria use CdiB transporters to export and present filamentous CdiA proteins on the cell surface. CdiA proteins carry a variety of polymorphic C\u2010terminal effector domains (CdiA\u2010CT), which are transferred directly into neighboring bacteria upon binding specific receptors (Aoki et al., 2008; Beck et al., 2016; Ruhe et al., 2017). T5SS/CDI loci also encode immunity proteins that neutralize CdiA\u2010CT toxin activity and protect the cell against self\u2010inhibition. After the discovery of CDI, type VI secretion systems (T6SS) were also found to mediate proximity\u2010dependent inter\u2010bacterial competition (Hood et al., 2010; MacIntyre et al., 2010). The T6SS is a bacteriophage\u2010like contractile apparatus that injects protein effectors directly into nearby target bacteria (Basler et al., 2012). In contrast to CdiA effectors, which carry a single toxin domain, the T6SS apparatus supports simultaneous delivery of multiple toxins with distinct activities (Russell et al., 2014). Other secretion systems were first predicted to mediate inter\u2010bacterial competition based on genetic linkage to toxin/immunity gene pairs. Zhang et al. predicted that Neisseria species export MafB toxins through type II secretion systems (T2SS), and that Gram\u2010positive bacteria use type VII secretion systems (T7SS) to deploy LXG/WXG100/ESAT\u20106 effectors (Zhang et al., 2012). Those predictions were subsequently supported by experimental work showing that both systems produce toxins and mediate inter\u2010cellular competition (Holberger et al., 2012; Jamet et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016; Ohr et al., 2017; Whitney et al., 2017). Further experimental studies uncovered additional polymorphic toxin delivery systems. Bacillus and Listeria use large cell\u2010wall associated YD\u2010repeat proteins to exchange polymorphic toxin domains (Koskiniemi et al., 2013). Xanthomonas species deliver toxins though a specialized type IV secretion system (Souza et al., 2015), and a type I secretion system mediates contact\u2010dependent competition in Caulobacter crescentus (Garcia\u2010Bayona et al., 2017). Most recently, polymorphic lipoprotein toxins were shown to inhibit cell growth when transferred between strains of Myxococcus xanthus through outer membrane exchange (Dey et al., 2016; Vassallo et al., 2017). Collectively, these observations indicate that inter\u2010cellular toxin exchange is a fundamental and ubiquitous facet of prokaryotic biology.",

            "text": "Toxin delivery mechanisms are manifold because the architecture of the bacterial cell envelope varies considerably between phyla. Thus, systems capable of breaching the Gram\u2010negative envelope are ineffective against Gram\u2010positive bacteria and vice versa. Nonetheless, divergent secretion systems from unrelated species often deploy closely related toxins. For example, uropathogenic E. coli isolates use T5SS/CdiA to deliver Ntox28 RNase domains into target bacteria (Beck et al., 2016). Ntox28 toxins also form the C\u2010terminal domains of YD\u2010peptide repeat proteins and T7SS effectors from Gram\u2010positive bacteria (Zhang et al., 2012; Diner et al., 2012). The Ntox28 toxins of Gram\u2010negative and Gram\u2010positive bacteria share similar tRNA anticodon nuclease activities, and their cognate immunity proteins are clearly homologous (Johnson et al., 2016). This sporadic distribution across unrelated species strongly suggests that toxin\u2010immunity gene pairs are spread through horizontal gene transfer (Zhang et al., 2012; Poole et al., 2011; Ruhe et al., 2016). In this model, newly acquired toxin\u2010immunity sequences are integrated into resident secretion system loci through genetic recombination (Aoki et al., 2010; Poole et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Arenas et al., 2013; Unterweger et al., 2014). The modular organization of antibacterial effectors facilitates this process. Effector proteins are typically composites in which variable C\u2010terminal toxins are fused to conserved N\u2010terminal elements that guide export through a specific secretion system (Zhang et al., 2012; Koskiniemi et al., 2013). Thus, polymorphic toxins are versatile payloads that can be delivered through several different secretion pathways.",

            "text": "EndoU (Endoribonuclease specific for uridylate) RNase domains are among the most commonly deployed toxins in bacterial competition (Zhang et al., 2012). Aravind and colleagues first predicted that these toxins are related in structure and activity to eukaryotic and viral RNA processing enzymes (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011). XendoU is the founding member of the EndoU superfamily and was isolated from Xenopus laevis as a uridylate specific endonuclease that releases small nucleolar RNAs from introns (Caffarelli et al., 1994; Caffarelli et al., 1997; Gioia et al., 2005; Laneve et al., 2003). RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales also encode EndoU nucleases. Nidoviral EndoU (NendoU) domains form the C\u2010termini of nonstructural proteins (Nsp) Nsp15 in coronaviruses and Nsp11 in arteriviruses (Snijder et al., 2003; Nedialkova et al., 2009). These endonucleases are essential for viral replication and have recently been shown to interfere with innate immune responses (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Ivanov et al., 2004; Kindler et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2017). XendoU and NendoU nucleases have the same core built from two \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomains and share a common catalytic triad that emanates from the N\u2010terminal subdomain (Joseph et al., 2007; Renzi et al., 2006; Ricagno et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). Though unrelated in sequence and fold, EndoU and eukaryotic RNase A nucleases have remarkably similar active sites and use the same catalytic mechanism to produce cyclic 2\u2032\u20103\u2032\u2010phosphodiester and 5\u2032\u2010hydroxyl termini (Laneve et al., 2003; Ivanov et al., 2004; Renzi et al., 2006; Ricagno et al., 2006; Nedialkova et al., 2009). Two bacterial EndoU toxins have been shown to have RNase activity (Holberger et al., 2012; Jamet et al., 2015), but there is currently no high\u2010resolution structural information for the prokaryotic enzymes. Here, we present the first structure of a bacterial EndoU toxin\u2010immunity protein complex from the T5SS/CDI system of E. coli STEC_O31. The CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 nuclease domain adopts the EndoU fold and contains a canonical catalytic triad, but unexpectedly it lacks the characteristic uridylate specificity of the superfamily. Instead, CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 is an anticodon loop nuclease that preferentially cleaves after a cytidylate residue in tRNAUUC\nGlu. This unique specificity is correlated with a distinct architecture that differs from previously characterized prokaryotic EndoU toxins.",

Limited proteolysis with subtilisin was used to generate a complex that is suitable for crystallization (Fig. S1). This treatment removed the N\u2010terminal \u201ctranslocation\u201d domain of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31. This domain does not affect toxin activity, but is required to transfer the CdiA\u2010CT into the cytoplasm of target bacteria (Willett et al., 2015). The truncated CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 and full\u2010length CdiISTECO31 crystallized in space group P65 with one complex in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined at 2.0 \u00c5 by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion approach using selenomethionine (SeMet)\u2010labeled proteins (Table 1). The final model contains residues Lys181 \u2013 Lys323 of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 and CdiISTECO31 residues Met1 \u2013 Pro120. The C\u2010terminal domain of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 adopts a V\u2010shaped structure comprised of two \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomains (Fig. 1A). The N\u2010terminal subdomain consists of a \u03b2\u2010hairpin (\u03b21 and \u03b22) followed by helix \u03b11 and an antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet. The sheet is composed of three major strands (\u03b23, \u03b24 and \u03b26) and a shorter \u03b25 strand that together with \u03b26 flanks \u03b24. The C\u2010terminal subdomain begins at helix \u03b12 and continues as an antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet (\u03b27, \u03b28 and \u03b29). The N\u2010terminal tail crosses over to the adjacent subdomain, bringing the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini into close proximity. The CdiISTECO31 immunity protein is composed of a core antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet (\u03b21\u2032, \u03b22\u2032, \u03b23\u2032 and \u03b24\u2032) surrounded by helices \u03b11\u2032, \u03b12\u2032, \u03b13\u2032 and \u03b14\u2032 (Fig. 1A). The \u03b2\u2010sheet is located topologically between helices \u03b12\u2032 and \u03b13\u2032. The immunity protein also contains three short sections (G1\u2032, G2\u2032 and G3\u2032) that adopt 310\u2010helical geometry (Fig. 1A).",

The N\u2010terminus and helix \u03b11\u2032 of CdiISTECO31 interact with the C\u2010terminal subdomain of the toxin, and the long G1\u2032 loop contacts the N\u2010terminal subdomain (Fig. 1A). The interface buries approximately 1,600 \u00c52, corresponding to ~20% of the total solvent\u2010accessible surface area as determined by PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). The interaction network is elaborate and features numerous direct contacts and more than 20 water\u2010mediated hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1B, Tables 2 and S1). Moreover, the toxin cleft is strongly electropositive, and several anionic residues from CdiISTECO31 form salt\u2010bridges (Fig. 1C). Asp48 and Asp78 of CdiISTECO31 form salt\u2010bridges with toxin residues Lys261 and Lys181 respectively. Arg307 and Tyr309 from the toxin also converge on the main\u2010chain carbonyl of CdiISTECO31 Asp48. CdiISTEO31 Tyr75 makes direct H\u2010bond contacts with His187, Gly202 and His204 (Fig. 1B and Table 2). The side\u2010chains of Trp17, Thr18, Asn28 and Glu29 emanate from CdiISTECO31 helix \u03b11\u2032 to make contacts with toxin residues Gly293, Gln295, Asp298 and Arg307 respectively (Figs. 1B and C). Additionally, CdiISTECO31 Trp17 makes van der Waals contacts in a pocket formed by toxin residues Gln295 and Gln312 (Fig. 1C). The N\u2010terminal subdomain of the toxin interacts primarily with CdiISTECO31 helix \u03b12\u2032 and the long G1\u2032 loop that links \u03b22\u2032 to \u03b23\u2032. Toxin residue Lys257 is the focal point of interactions with side\u2010chains of Asp34, Glu37 and Asn38 from immunity helix \u03b12\u2032 (Fig. 1B and C). Residues Asp61 and Ser63 from the G1\u2032 loop form direct H\u2010bonds with toxin residue Lys197 (Fig. 1B and Table 2), and CdiISTECO31 Tyr60 packs against residues Ala243, Ala244 and Gly245, which form the \u03b2\u2010turn connecting toxin strands \u03b24 and \u03b25 (Fig. 1C).",

Coronaviral NendoU domains were the top hits in the search: coronavirus 229E Nsp15 (PDB:4S1T), Z = 6.1, rmsd 3.6 \u00c5 over 100 C\u03b1 atoms; SARS Nsp15 (PDB:2RHB (Bhardwaj et al., 2008)) Z = 6.0, rmsd 3.6 \u00c5 over 101 C\u03b1 atoms; SARS Nsp15 (PDB:2H85 (Ricagno et al., 2006)), Z = 6.0, rmsd 3.5 \u00c5 over 100 C\u03b1 atoms, and murine hepatitis virus Nsp15 (PDB:2GTH (Xu et al., 2006)), Z = 5.5, rmsd 3.8 \u00c5 for 101 C\u03b1 atoms. The NendoU domains and CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 toxin have essentially identical topologies, though some secondary structure elements vary in length and relative position (Fig. 2A and B). Notably, NendoU domains harbor the two catalytic His residues within helix \u03b18 and the adjacent loop, which corresponds to loop \u03b22\u2010\u03b11 that follows the \u03b21\u2010\u03b22 hairpin of the toxin domain (Figs. 2A and B). CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 also contains additional residues that form strand \u03b25 and contribute to an elongated helix \u03b12 (Fig. 2B). XendoU (PDB:2C1W (Renzi et al., 2006)) is more distantly related to the toxin at Z = 5.2, rmsd 3.1 \u00c5 over 108 C\u03b1 atoms. As with Nsp15, the XendoU active\u2010site loop aligns poorly with the \u03b21\u2010\u03b22 hairpin of the toxin (Fig. 2C and D). NendoU domains from arteriviral Nsp11 proteins show the lowest structural similarity to the toxin. Nsp11 from porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PDB:5DA1) was recovered at Z = 4.5 with rmsd 3.7 \u00c5 over 84 C\u03b1 atoms. Notably, sequence homology between CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 and the eukaryotic EndoU domains is low, ranging from ~9% identity with XendoU up to about 15% for the coronavirus NendoU domains (Fig. 2B and D). The structural homology search also recovered a handful of pseudopilin proteins from T2SSs. However, structural similarity with pseudopilins is limited to the C\u2010terminal subdomain of the toxin.",

            "text": "Two prokaryotic EndoU toxins have been characterized to date. BC0920 from Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 is a putative T7SS effector that degrades rRNA and tRNA in vivo (Holberger et al., 2012). MafB1 from Neisseria meningitidis 8013 cleaves RNA after uridylate nucleotides in vitro (Jamet et al., 2015). To determine whether CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 possesses similar activity, we expressed the toxin in E. coli and examined RNA for degradation. Although the toxin inhibited cell growth (Fig. S2A), there was no obvious RNase activity in the intoxicated cells (Fig. S2B). Because several CDI toxins cleave specific tRNAs (Nikolakakis et al., 2012; Willett et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2017; Michalska et al., 2017), we used Northern blot analysis to identify possible tRNA substrates. This screen revealed efficient cleavage of tRNAUUC\nGlu in CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 intoxicated cells, but not in cells expressing other toxins (Fig. 3). We also detected modest nuclease activity against tRNAGUC\nAsp, tRNAUUG\nGln, tRNACCC\nGly, tRNAUCC\nGly, tRNAGCC\nGly, tRNAUUU\nLys, tRNAGGU\nThr and tRNACCA\nTrp (Fig. 3). These results indicate that CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 exhibits a tRNase activity that is novel for the EndoU superfamily.",

            "text": "A DALI server search for structural homologs of CdiISTECO31 returned NMB0503 from N. meningitidis MC58 (PDB ID:4Q7O, (Tan et al., 2015)) with Z = 13.4 and rmsd 2.6 \u00c5 over 111 C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 4A). Although it shares only ~16% sequence identity with CdiISTECO31 (Fig. 4B), NMB0503 is probably an immunity protein because the upstream NMB0502 reading frame encodes a C\u2010terminal EndoU domain that is 39% identical to CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 (Fig. 4C). Moreover, NMB0502 has the same tRNase activity as CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 when expressed in E. coli (Fig. S3). The structures of the two immunity proteins deviate in three regions: (i) NMB0503 contains an N\u2010terminal helix (\u03b10\u2032) that is absent from CdiISTECO31; (ii) the loop connecting \u03b22\u2032 to \u03b23\u2032 is extended in NMB0503 and contains an additional 310 helix and (iii) CdiISTECO31 contains a 310 helix (G2\u2032) in the loop connecting \u03b23\u2032 to \u03b24\u2032 (Fig. 4B). Given that these secondary structure elements interact with the toxin domain in the CdiA\u2010CT/CdiISTECO31 structure (Fig. 4A), the discrepancies may reflect the toxin\u2010free state of NMB0503 (Tan et al., 2015). However, NMB0502 diverges from CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 in regions that interact directly with CdiISTECO31 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that these differences are critical for specific binding interactions between toxins and cognate immunity proteins. This conclusion is supported by alignments of closely related EndoU toxins and immunity proteins, which show that each pair possesses a unique set of residues contributing to the binding interface (Fig. S4).",

            "text": "To explore the specificity of immunity proteins, we tested whether EndoU toxins can be neutralized by near\u2010cognate CdiI. We first fused the cdiA\u2010CT/cdiI\nSTECO31 module to the cdiA\nEC93 gene of E. coli EC93, thereby generating a plasmid\u2010borne CDI system capable of delivering CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 toxin into E. coli target cells. Inhibitor cells expressing the chimeric CDISTECO31 system significantly outcompeted E. coli target bacteria when seeded at a 1:1 ratio in co\u2010culture (Fig. 5A). Northern blot analysis revealed cleaved tRNAUUC\nGlu in the mixed culture (Fig. 5C). Because inhibitor cells are immune to the toxin, the latter result suggests that most of the tRNAUUC\nGlu is degraded in target bacteria. Target cells expressing CdiISTECO31 were protected from both growth inhibition and tRNase activities (Fig. 5A and C). By contrast, targets expressing near\u2010cognate NMB0503 were inhibited to the same extent as cells with no immunity gene (Fig. 5A), and Northern blot showed that NMB0503 failed to neutralize tRNase activity (Fig. 5C). We then tested whether a more closely related immunity protein blocks CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31. The T5SS/CDI locus of Yersinia mollaretii ATCC 43969 encodes an EndoU toxin and immunity protein that are ~55% and ~58% identical to CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 and CdiISTECO31 respectively (Fig. 4B and C). Despite this homology, cdiI\nYmo43969 expression did not protect target cells from CDISTECO31 mediated growth inhibition (Fig. 5A and C). To confirm that the cdiI\nYmo43969 construct produces functional immunity protein, we tested it against inhibitor cells that express a CdiAEC93\u2010CTYmo43969 fusion protein. The chimeric CDIYmo43969 system is less potent than CDISTECO31 (compare Fig. 5B to A), but toxic nuclease activity was detected in co\u2010cultures with non\u2010immune target cells (Fig. 5D). As expected, target cells that express CdiIYmo43969 were immune to CDIYmo43969 mediated growth inhibition and nuclease activity, but near\u2010cognate CdiISTECO31 failed to protect target bacteria (Figs. 5B and 5D). Surprisingly, we found that NMB0503\u2010expressing target cells were not killed in co\u2010culture with CDIYmo43969 inhibitors (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, cleaved tRNAUUC\nGlu accumulated in this latter co\u2010culture (Fig. 5D), demonstrating that NMB0503 immunity protein does not completely block tRNase activity. Presumably, the NMB0503 expressing target cells retained enough full\u2010length tRNA to support growth. Taken together, these results indicate that each EndoU toxin\u2010immunity protein interaction is distinct.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic EndoU nucleases cleave phosphodiester bonds using a His\u2010His\u2010Lys catalytic triad (Ivanov et al., 2004; Guarino et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2007; Nedialkova et al., 2009). The EndoU catalytic mechanism is similar to that of RNase A, which uses two His residues to mediate proton transfers and Lys to stabilize the pentavalent phosphoryl transition\u2010state (Findlay et al., 1962; Deavin et al., 1966; Cuchillo et al., 2011). Structural superimposition suggests that toxin residues His187 and His204 are equivalent to the catalytic His residues in SARS Nsp15 (His234/His249) and XendoU (His162/His178) (Fig. 6A). Further, CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 Lys261 is positioned near Lys289 of Nsp15 and Lys224 of XendoU (Fig. 6A). The EndoU active site also contains conserved residues that contribute to uridylate specificity. Ser293 of SARS Nsp15 (Ser174 in EAV Nsp11, Ser228 in XendoU) is predicted to form a H\u2010bond with O2 of uracil, and Tyr342 (Tyr216 in EAV Nsp11, Tyr280 in XendoU) is thought to stack onto the pyrimidine ring (Bhardwaj et al., 2008; Nedialkova et al., 2009). The structure overlay suggests that CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 residues Thr262 and His321 may also function in substrate discrimination (Fig. 6A). Finally, toxin residue Pro322 superimposes closely onto conserved Pro residues that are required for Nsp15 nuclease activity (Fig. 6A) (Ricagno et al., 2006; Bhardwaj et al., 2008).",

We first introduced Ala substitutions into the CdiAEC93\u2010CTSTECO31 chimera and tested inhibition activity in competition co\u2010cultures. Mutation of His187, His204, Lys261, Thr262 and His321 abrogated growth inhibition (Fig. 6B). In contrast, substitution of Asn319 in the toxin active site had no discernable effect on inhibition activity (Fig. 6B). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that each CdiA variant was produced at the same level as the wild\u2010type effector (Fig. S5). Furthermore, the mutated effectors were susceptible to degradation with extracellular proteinase K (Fig. S5), indicating that each was exported to the cell surface properly. Although target bacteria were not inhibited by cells deploying the Lys261Ala and Thr262Ala toxin variants (Fig. 6B), we detected tRNase activity in these co\u2010cultures (Fig. 6C). Presumably, these latter toxins are attenuated enough to allow target cell growth. We then compared the activities of mutant toxins to wild\u2010type CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 using in vitro nuclease assays. Purified wild\u2010type toxin cleaved tRNAUUC\nGlu efficiently, but its activity was neutralized when purified CdiISTECO31 immunity protein was included in the reaction (Fig. 6D). The His204Ala substitution appeared to ablate nuclease activity, and toxins carrying His187Ala and Lys261Ala substitutions exhibited little activity in vitro (Fig. 6D). The Thr262Ala and His321Ala substitutions also significantly reduced nuclease activity compared to wild\u2010type (Fig. 6D). Purified Asn319Ala toxin retained nuclease activity (Fig. 6D), consistent with its near wild\u2010type function in the competition co\u2010culture experiments (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 uses the same metal\u2010independent catalytic mechanism as RNase A and eukaryotic EndoU nucleases. Consistent with this model, we found that purified CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 retains robust tRNase activity in reactions supplemented with EDTA (Fig. S6). Thus, the CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 EndoU domain appears to function as a metal\u2010independent phosphotransferase.",

            "text": "The tRNase activity of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 differs from previously characterized EndoU toxins, suggesting the superfamily may have evolved a broader spectrum of substrate specificities. Analysis of EndoU toxin sequences from predicted T5SS/CdiA effector proteins shows that the domains segregate into at least three major clades. Clade I domains are related to the previously characterized MafB1 toxin from N. meningitidis 8013 (Jamet et al., 2015) (Fig. 7A). Clade I toxins are characterized by greatly abbreviated N\u2010terminal subdomains that lack the \u03b11, \u03b23, \u03b24 and \u03b25 elements of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 (Fig. S7). Clade I toxins contain additional residues between \u03b12 and \u03b27 in the C\u2010terminal subdomain and sometimes carry extended C\u2010terminal tails (Fig. S7). Clade II toxins are similar to BC0920 from B. cereus ATCC 14579 and are predicted to lack helix \u03b11 (Figs. 7A and S7). CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31, CdiA\u2010CTYmo43969 and NMB0502 contain clade III nuclease domains (Fig. 7A). All EndoU domains are predicted to carry the two catalytic His residues within a \u03b2\u2010hairpin, though the spacing of these residues varies amongst toxins (Fig. S7). Clades I and III contain the catalytic Lys residue within a conserved K\u2010(S/T) motif in strand \u03b26 (Fig. S7). The equivalent Lys residues are not easily identified in clade II, though many of these toxins contain irregularly spaced K\u2010(S/T) motifs within the \u03b25 region (Fig. S7).",

For clade I, we chose a predicted CdiA\u2010CT from Klebsiella aerogenes GN05224, reasoning that it should be functional when fused to CdiAEC93 to generate a chimeric effector. Additionally, the CdiA\u2010CTGN05224 EndoU domain shares 61% sequence identity with the previously characterized N. meningitidis MafB1 toxin (Jamet et al., 2015). Purified CdiA\u2010CTGN05224 degrades 5S rRNA and several tRNA species in vitro (Fig. 7B). Similar RNase activity was detected in competition co\u2010cultures with inhibitor cells that deploy CdiA\u2010CTGN05224, though 5S rRNA degradation was not observed in vivo (Fig. S8), presumably because it is protected by ribosomal proteins. We also found that CdiA\u2010CTGN05224 RNase activity is effectively neutralized by CdiIGN05224 immunity protein in vitro (Fig. 7B) and in vivo (Fig. S8). We chose B. cereus BC0920 as a representative clade II toxin and found that its RNase activity is similar to that of CdiA\u2010CTGN05224 (Fig. 7B). Like the other nucleases, BC0920 activity was suppressed when the reaction was supplemented with purified BC0921 immunity protein (Fig. 7B). Finally, we confirmed the substrate specificity of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 toxin in vitro. Purified CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 cleaves tRNAUUC\nGlu efficiently and shows partial activity on tRNAGCC\nGly, but has no discernable activity on tRNAGAU\nIle, tRNAGUA\nTyr or 5S rRNA (Fig. 7B). Moreover, CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 is most likely a specific endonuclease, because it produces stable 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments of tRNAUUC\nGlu (Fig. 7B).",

Therefore, we designed an oligonucleotide that anneals downstream of the anticodon for primer extension analysis (Fig. 8A). Analysis of 3\u2032\u2010fragments generated from in vivo toxin expression revealed cleavage at the 5\u2032\u2010side of m2A38 (Fig. 8B and C). This same site was observed in tRNAUUC\nGlu isolated from competition co\u2010cultures. As expected, these cleavages were not detected in cells that express cdiI\nSTECO31 (Fig. 8B). We also determined the same cleavage site in tRNAUUC\nGlu digested with purified CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31\nin vitro (Fig. 8B).

            "text": "Aravind and colleagues first identified the link between eukaryotic EndoU RNases and a broadly distributed family of antibacterial toxins (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011). The structure of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 confirms those predictions, and mutational analysis suggests that this toxin uses the same catalytic mechanism as eukaryotic EndoU nucleases. However, there are also significant differences between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleases. Purified XendoU and Nsp15 are only active in the presence of millimolar Mn2+ or Ca2+ (Laneve et al., 2003; Schwarz and Blower, 2014; Ivanov et al., 2004; Bhardwaj et al., 2004), whereas the bacterial toxins examined here have no metal requirement. There is no direct role for divalent metal in the EndoU catalytic mechanism (Ricagno et al., 2006; Renzi et al., 2006), and like the bacterial toxins, arteriviral Nsp11 is active in the absence of metal (Nedialkova et al., 2009). These observations suggest that metals may promote XendoU and Nsp15 nuclease activity through allostery. This model is consistent with data showing that SARS Nsp15 undergoes conformational changes upon titration with Mn2+ (Bhardwaj et al., 2004). Allosteric regulation could be mediated by the additional structural elements found in eukaryotic EndoU enzymes. Bacterial EndoU domains are about half the size of XendoU, which contains ~150 additional N\u2010terminal residues that form an extensive \u03b1\u2010helical cradle that surrounds and supports the nuclease core (Renzi et al., 2006). In this model, conformational changes in the supporting cradle would reshape the active\u2010site cleft and/or alter the configuration of the catalytic triad. The supporting structures in NendoU domains are abbreviated, but Nsp11 and Nsp15 contain additional N\u2010terminal domains that mediate oligomerization (Bhardwaj et al., 2008; Ricagno et al., 2006). Oligomerization is critical for Nsp15 activity because the active\u2010site loop is stabilized by the \u03b210\u2010\u03b211 \u201csupporting loop\u201d, which is in turn conformationally constrained by the neighboring protomer (Joseph et al., 2007; Guarino et al., 2005). In monomeric Nsp15, the active\u2010site loop is untethered and migrates into the substrate\u2010binding groove, where it presumably blocks the interaction with substrate RNA. Similarly, one of the active\u2010site loops is disordered in crystal structures of homodimeric Nsp11, again raising the possibility that RNase activity is regulated through multimerization (Shi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Joseph et al., 2007). These findings suggest that eukaryotic EndoU proteins must be carefully controlled because unrestrained RNase activity is lethal. Such allosteric control should not be required of prokaryotic EndoU nucleases, because these enzymes are used to inhibit bacterial cell growth. Nevertheless, the potent toxic effects of EndoU nucleases must be suppressed in the producing cell, thus providing the selective pressure to evolve immunity proteins that protect against self\u2010intoxication.",

            "text": "The narrow substrate specificity of CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 is surprising given that all previously characterized EndoU enzymes cleave RNAs after uridylate. The determinants governing EndoU nuclease specificity have been examined most extensively for viral NendoU proteins. Ser293 in Nsp15 (Ser228 in XendoU) is predicted to form specific H\u2010bond contacts with uracil, and Ala substitutions at this position relax specificity and increase the rate of cleavage at cytidylate nucleotides (Ricagno et al., 2006; Bhardwaj et al., 2008; Nedialkova et al., 2009). The corresponding residue in CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 is Thr262, which is able to form the same H\u2010bond contacts with uracil as Ser. Moreover, Thr residues at this position have been shown to promote uridylate specificity in other NendoU\u2010containing proteins (Bhardwaj et al., 2008; Nedialkova et al., 2009). Nevertheless, CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 does not recognize uridylate and instead cleaves tRNAUUC\nGlu between nucleotides C37 and m2A38. The in vivo toxin activity screen suggests that the C37\u2010A38 motif is a positive recognition determinant, because tRNAGUC\nAsp and tRNAGly isoacceptors share this element and are subject to partial cleavage. However, the toxin probably monitors the overall structure of the anticodon loop, because it discriminates against the tRNAGUC\nAsp anticodon, which differs from tRNAUUC\nGlu only at nucleotide 35. All of the clade III toxins examined here have anticodon nuclease activity, suggesting that their shared architecture determines substrate specificity. Clade III domains are characterized by helix \u03b11, which is apparently absent from the other clades. Helix \u03b11 supports the \u03b21\u2010\u03b22\u2010hairpin in the CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 structure, and therefore it is conceivable that this structural element shapes the active\u2010site cleft. We note that clade III also contains toxins from Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species that appear to lack strand \u03b25 in the N\u2010terminal subdomain (see Fig. S7). It will be of interest to determine whether these enzymes share anticodon nuclease activity with CdiA\u2010CTSTECO31 or perhaps exhibit distinct substrate specificities.",

            "text": "The EndoU superfamily is one of the most widely used toxins in inter\u2010bacterial competition. Aravind and colleagues initially identified EndoU effectors associated with T2SS/MafB, T5SS, T6SS and T7SS delivery platforms (Zhang et al., 2012; Holberger et al., 2012; Jamet et al., 2015). More recent database searches indicate that EndoU domains are deployed by several other systems \u2013 some of which have been previously described and others that appear to be novel. We identified bacterial EndoU domains fused to the C\u2010termini of PrsW, SpvB and MuF\u2010like phage\u2010head morphogenesis proteins (Table S2), all of which have been proposed to deliver polymorphic toxins (Zhang et al., 2012). Intriguingly, EndoU nuclease are also fused to VgrG\u2010like proteins in Gram\u2010positive Paenibacillus species (Table S2). VgrG is a critical structural component of T6SS and often carries C\u2010terminal toxin domains (Russell et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2014). However, T6SSs have only been characterized in Gram\u2010negative bacteria, and Paenibacillus genomes contain no recognizable T6SS core genes. Nevertheless, these VgrG proteins are encoded together with DUF4280 (PAAR\u2010like) and pentapeptide repeat adaptor proteins that are similar to those found in T6SS effector operons from Gram\u2010negative bacteria. We also found a PAAR\u2010like protein with a C\u2010terminal EndoU domain in Clostridium sp. ASBs410 (Table S2). Together, these observations strongly suggest that Gram\u2010positive bacteria possess phage\u2010like secretion systems that are functionally analogous to T6SS. In addition to these recognizable toxin delivery systems, we identified EndoU\u2010containing proteins with unusual N\u2010terminal domains and several others that contain no other conserved domains whatsoever (Table S2). Some of these proteins carry N\u2010terminal secretion signal sequences, and nearly all are encoded together with probable immunity proteins. We speculate that these latter uncharacterized proteins are also used for inter\u2010bacterial toxin delivery. Finally, we identified a handful of extraordinarily large (1.5 to 2.9 MDa) proteins from Actinobacteria that carry internal EndoU domains. These proteins typically contain one or more APH aminoglycoside phosphotransferase domains together with a variety of RNA/DNA\u2010binding modules (Table S3). The function of these proteins is not known, but they appear unlikely to mediate inter\u2010cellular competition given the central location of the EndoU domain and the absence of linked immunity genes. The unusual domain assemblage suggests that these enormous proteins could process nucleic acids, or perhaps synthesize secondary metabolites or antibiotics in a manner similar to polyketide synthases. Regardless of their precise activities, these latter proteins suggest that EndoU domains have also been coopted to perform non\u2010inhibitory functions in bacteria.",
