It is characterized by low molecular weight (41\u201343 kDa), low pI (2.8\u20133.8) and high percentage of carbohydrates (45%). AGP is supposed to have an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory role, based on its ability to down-regulate neutrophil and lymphocyte responsiveness and to modulate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (Bories et al., 1990;Vasson et al., 1994). Some of these anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities depend on the glycosylation pattern of AGP (Shiyan and Bovin, 1997). In humans, the rate of sialylation has been suggested to increase the resistance to inflammation, even in viral infections such as HIV (Atemezem et al., 2001; Mackiewicz and Mackiewicz, 1995; Rabehi et al., 1995).",

            "text": "During studies on the glycosylation pattern of fAGP we identified a second, different protein of about 29 kDa, that we named fAGP relatedprotein (fAGPrP) due to its cross-reactivity with a monoclonal anti-human AGP antibody. The concentration of fAGPrP in blood was not related to that of fAGP. A computational analysis (http://dove.embl-heidelberg.de/blast) of human AGP did not find protein homologues to AGP, suggesting that fAGPrP is a protein different from AGP. Moreover, the protein disappeared when AGP was purified to homogeneity. However, since the low isoelectric point of AGP is largely due to the glycan moiety of the protein (Shiyan and Bovin, 1997), it is also possible that a partial deglycosylated isoform of 29 kDa is not co-purified with the completely glycosylated AGP (Paltrinieri et al., 2003). We are now purifying and sequencing this protein to understand if it is an isoform of fAGP, a new APP or a protein with different function. In the meanwhile, we have examined fAGPrP distribution in blood and tissues from cats with different pathological conditions: fAGPrP was underexpressed in serum from cats with FIP and overexpressed in cats with FIV and purulent inflammations. Moreover, in healthy cats fAGPrP had an intrahepatocytic localization and the plasma positivity typical of APP (Ceciliani et al., 2002) but was also expressed on tissue cells which were particularly abundant in the lamina propria of small intestine and in perifollicular areas of lymphoid organs. During inflammation, fAGPrP showed an endothelial and an epithelial lining and the number of positive cells was very variable depending on the disease: this variability was particularly evident in the few cases of FIP examined (Paltrinieri et al., 2003).",

The endothelial lining detectable in small and medium vessels was often more intense toward foci containing FCoVs (Fig. 5\n). Positive cells were occasionally present within the fibrinous perivisceritis, independently on the presence of viruses. In the same way, intraparenchimatous foci were often rich of FCoV-positive cells with fAGPrP positivity confined to the central areas of necrosis, and myeloid cells peripherally distributed (Fig. 6\n). Also the above mentioned changes in both the number and distribution of fAGPrP positive cells were not dependent on the presence of parenchimal lesions or of viruses. Moreover, the presence of viral antigen in lymphoid organs did not influence the number and distribution of positive cells: in many cases, in fact, FCoV bearing cells were detectable within the germinal centers but few positive cells were detectable in perifollicular areas, while in other cases positive cells increased in number and were irregularly distributed compared to controls, even in absence of viral antigen (Fig. 7\n).",

Previous findings suggested that fAGPrP is down-regulated in the blood but variably distributed in tissues from cats with FIP (Paltrinieri et al., 2003). This variability was confirmed by the present study and the distribution of fAGPrP in the control cats was similar to that previously reported. Nevertheless, some of the results from the cats with FIP apparently contrast with the previous ones: the intensity of fAGPrP positivity in plasma was often stronger than in controls. However, this mainly occurred in tissues such as kidney and lung, in which vessels are normally so small as to be not easily detectable. It appears more likely than the strong positivity detected in these organs is due to increased amounts of plasma due to vasodilation rather than to an increased expression of fAGPrP. Moreover, the presence of extravasated fAGPrP close to pyogranulomatous foci or on pulmonary epithelium might explain the previously reported decrease of circulating fAGPrP (Paltrinieri et al., 2003).",

Only in lung and in lymphoid organs were the number of positive cells higher than in controls. The increased number of cells in the lung might be due, again, to the low number of cells detectable in a normal lung: a non-specific inflammatory response might lead to an easily detectable increased number of \u201cresponsive\u201d cells. These cells, in fact, are morphologically similar to IgM- or IgA-producing plasma cells (Waly et al., 2001). On this perspective it is not so surprising to find it within inflammatory foci, where plasma cells have been already identified (Kipar et al., 1998), or in lymphoid organs.",

However, it should be considered that the amount of FCoVs per lesion has already been reported to be extremely variable and not related to the extent or to the histotype of the lesion (Tammer et al., 1995; Kipar et al., 1998): it cannot be excluded, thus, that the amount of fAGPrP might be related to other factors possibly involved in the histogenesis of the lesions (e.g. immune-complexes, cytokines).",

The lack of relationship among FCoVs and fAGPrP-expressing cells is not surprising, since the latter are not thought to be IgG-producing plasma cells. In contrast, in some cats the increased number and the diffuse distribution of fAGPrP-expressing cells was consistent with the hypothesis that these cells might be IgM-producing plasma cells. During the early phase of the immune responses against FCoV, when circulating \u03b2-globulins, among which IgM migrate, increase (Paltrinieri et al., 2001), IgM-producing plasma cells might increase in lymphoid tissues. Unfortunately, our work has been performed on spontaneous cases of FIP: therefore we cannot know when the cats had the first contact with the virus or how long the presence of viruses was lasting. These speculations need to be supported by results from experimental infections, on which the changes in blood concentration of different proteins can be easily followed (Jacobse-geels et al., 1982;Stoddart et al., 1988).",

Nevertheless, fAGPrP do not seem to be directly involved in the histogenesis of the lesions during FIP or in the distribution of the virus throughout the body. The underexpression of fAGPrP previously recorded in blood from cats with FIP is most likely due to the extravasation from blood toward inflammatory foci or lung epithelium. However, these findings does not exclude that fAGPrP may play some role in protecting cats from the disease: in this regards further studies on the structure and glycosylation pattern of this protein in FCoV infected non-symptomatic cats are required.",
