All the positive samples were subjected to screen for other canine enteric virus by the methods previously described, including CPV[27], CaAstV[28], CaKV[29], TTCaV[30]. In addition, primer pairs EL1F/ EL1R, CEPol-1/ TGSP-2 and S5F/ S6R, which amplify CCoV-I, CCoV-IIb and CCoV-IIa genes, respectively, were used to differentiate gene types of CCoV, as previously To amplify the genome of CCoV, we downloaded all the available genomes of CCoV, (http://www.megasoftware.net/).According to the conserved region of CCoV genomes, we designed 17 pairs of pairs of primers have overlapping portions to facilitate sequences assembling. The PCR products were determined by a commercial company (GENERAL program (http://www.megasoftware.net/), and then edited manually. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using RAxML (v8.2.10) with the maximum likelihood method and GTR + GAMMA model.

In our study, apart from the single infection with CCoV-I, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, two or three genotypes multiple infections accounts for29.41% (15/51), which indicates co-infection of different CCoV subtypes were widely existed. Previously studies have reported that CCoV-II, especially CCoV-IIa is the main subtypes circulating in Heilongjiang of China during 2014-2015, and CCoV-IIb is the major subtypes circulating in Vietnam[39]. Here, of the CCoV positive dogs, 42 219 (82.35%) dogs were positive for CCoV-IIa, which is obvious higher than CCoV-I 220 (29.41%) and CCoV-IIb (23.53%). These results revealed that CCoV-IIa play a more dominated role among pet dogs in China.Phylogenetic analysis of complete S gene indicated that canine coronavirus can be divided into 2 genotypes, which consistent with previous studies[22]. However, in this study, we discovered that CCoV-II can be divided into 3 distinct subtypes CCoV-IIa, CCoV-IIb and CCoV-II Variant, which is differ from the 2 subtypes CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb as mentioned before. In addition, phylogenetic analysis results also revealed that CCoV-IIa is the predominate genotype currently circulating in China.The strain B906_ZJ_2019 was clustered into CCoV-II variant with strain A76 , which was identified a novel NTD with other CCoV-II strains and may as a result of recombination of CCoV-I and CCoV-II[34]. Recombination plays a vital role in genetic evolution of coronavirus, and have high potential for the emergence of novel variants[46]. CCoV-IIb was suggested as a novel recombinant variant, which show protein is the major antigenicity determinant and also play a vital role in receptor binding and viral entry[49]. During virus entry, S1 subunit is the major region that binds to host cell surface receptors, while S2 is associated with membrane fusion[50]. necessary to monitor the evolution process of canine coronavirus.Here, we investigated the etiology and evolution changes of CCoV in China. We may evolve from a recombinant virus of CCoV-I and CCoV-II. In general, the resulting data of CCoV provide detailed etiological and evolution information of CCoV strains current circulating in China, which will help to the future prevention Supplementary Materials:Table S1: the primers of CCoV genome amplification.W.Z. and G.L. analyzed the data; W.Z. wrote the paper.Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.
