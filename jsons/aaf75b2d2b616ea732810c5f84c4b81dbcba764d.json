Since its detection in humans at the end of 2019, it has rapidly spread worldwide causing respiratory infections of various degrees of severity. The most common symptoms, which develop within 2-14 days of exposure, are dry cough, fever and fatigue [1, 2] . Mild infections may be self-limiting in few days, but in some cases the respiratory symptoms can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high risk of death from multiorgan failure. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be used to confirm the presence of 2019-nCoV. A CT scan of the chest is the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of lung involvement. Ground-glass opacity and crazy-craving patterning are the most common radiological signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. CT is commonly used to evaluate lung damage during recovery [3] . Recently, we investigated the role of lung US in the early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia and showed a strong correlation between lung US and CT scans in all investigated patients [4] . No specific treatment or vaccines against COVID-19 are currently available. COVID-19 patients can be treated with antivirals but there is no clear evidence of benefit [5] . The most important way to fight this viral infection is to detect COVID-19 early, isolate cases, trace contacts and deliver the correct information to the general public [6] . Gastrointestinal involvement, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, has been recently reported in the literature [7] . Diarrhoea occurs secondary to the interaction between ACE2, highly expressed in the human small intestine, and 2019-nCoV cell entry receptor ACE2. Recent studies show that 2019-nCoV RNA has been detected in stool samples, confirming faecal-oral transmission. According to the literature, the incidence of diarrhoea could be underestimated [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 458, "end": 461, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 462, "end": 464, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1029, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1216, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1389, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1565, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1702, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2047, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In the current case report, we consider COVID-19 infection in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal symptoms in 10 patients who referred to our Emergency Department in February 2020, at the beginning of the spread of COVID-19 in Italy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "CASE DESCRIPTION Ten patients (6 males, 4 females) with mean age 50\u00b118 years were admitted to our Emergency Department complaining of fever and flulike symptoms in the previous 5-10 days, with general malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain and vomiting/diarrhoea. Only one patient denied cough and fever. None of them had a history of abdominal surgery or a notable medical history, including inflammatory bowel disease. They reported no melena or weight loss. Diarrhoea was defined according the WHO criteria as having three or more loose or liquid stools per day or having more stools than normal. Physical examinations were normal with no distended abdomens, tenderness or hypo/ hyperactive bowel sounds. The vital signs were in the normal range with a maximum body temperature of 39\u00b0C (37.6\u00b11\u00b0C). At admission, four patients complained of dyspnoea with significantly decreased PaO 2 /FiO 2 and a need for oxygen. A nasopharyngeal swab sample confirmed COVID-19 infection in all patients. The patients' characteristics at admission are reported in Table 1 . Laboratory tests revealed lymphopenia, high C-reactive protein and altered liver enzymes in most of the patients, as reported in Table 2 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1056, "end": 1063, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1202, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Tests revealed an average white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.15 (3.2-9.29) \u00d710 9 /l, platelets (PLT) 176.7 (82-341) \u00d710 9 /l, and lymphocytes 1.31 (0.60-2.76) \u00d710 9 /l. The eosinophil percentage was undetectable in all patients. The average value of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) was 77.4 U/l (29-162 U/l), AST (aspartate aminotransferase) was 81.9 (30-284) U/l, and GGT (gamma glutamyltransferase) was 123 (54-218) U/l. Bilirubin was increased in only one patient (pt 2, Table 2 ) who developed pancytopenia and haemolytic anaemia, which improved with oral steroid therapy. The average value of CRP was 6.6 (1.5-21.37) mg/dl. When measured, procalcitonin was always undetectable, excluding a bacterial infection. Despite the diarrhoea, only two patients had slowly increasing creatinine levels (pt 7 and 9, Table 2 ). The serum potassium level was in the normal range in all patients. In the patient who complained only of diarrhoea with no flu-like symptoms (pt 1, Table 1 ), we performed stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and enteric pathogens, which were all negative. All patients were investigated with bedside US, which showed a diffuse B-pattern, due to a severe loss of aeration, with spared areas with no pleural effusion; in six patients subpleural consolidation in the lower lobes was detected. Chest CT confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with typical imaging signs of ground-glass opacity, patchy consolidation and crazy-paving patterning, which were also detected by lung US. An X-ray of the abdomen was performed in only one patient (pt 2, Table 1 ) and was normal. US of the abdomen did not reveal an abnormal stomach and bowel distention, except in one female patient (pt 8, Table 1 ) who had bowel inflammatory signs (peri-intestinal inflammatory reaction) as confirmed by a CT scan of the abdomen. This patient completely recovered after antiviral treatment and was discharged home with no signs of bowel disease on US of the abdomen. All the patients were treated with supportive care and antiviral therapy, including lopinavir and ritonavir tablets. Diarrhoea completely resolved. Six patients have been discharged with the diagnosis of 'COVID-19 pneumonia and diarrhoea'. Four patients (pt 3, 7, 9, 10, Tables 1 and 2) developed acute severe respiratory distress syndrome requiring immediate intubation. They are still in Intensive Care Unit at the time of writing.
