Surgical masks should be changed every 4\u20136 h, according to type and producer\u2019s instructions.(E)Nursing and medical staff should be tested at least upon the appearance of symptoms, whose definition should be as broad as possible.

Testing should be proposed as much as possible, but will be probably decided on a case-by-case basis (availability of the test, risk factors, logistic situation of the dialysis center).Patients with fever and signs of airways infection:According to the rules defined in each setting, the patient must be sent to the emergency room, or to a dedicated area, isolated from the dialysis ward, for evaluation and work-up before dialysis.If the infectious disease specialist decides to carry out a nasopharyngeal swab, there are 3 possible situations:While waiting for the result, the patient should be treated as if affected by SARS-CoV-2;if dialysis cannot be postponed, whenever possible, the patient must be hospitalized and dialyzed in a room equipped for dialysis treatment. If mobile dialysis water preparation devices are available, they should be previously connected in one or two rooms in the infectious diseases ward or where hospitalization and treatment can be safely carried out. According to the center\u2019s experience, a CRRT machine or a portable hemodialysis machine can be considered as alternatives.For the dialysis care of these cases, health professionals should wear the personal protection advised for infected cases.If the outcome of the swab is positive, the patient must remain in isolation and the operators in contact with the patient must be equipped as above.Due to the complexity of the management of dialysis patients, their fragility, their risk of sudden decompensating, we suggest, whenever possible, hospitalizing them until recovery.Recovery after SARS-CoV-2 infection has to be certified, according to the current indications.If the outcome of the swab is negative, the patients can return to the dialysis facility.In case of respiratory distress or failure ER staff must be summoned immediately, since the need for mechanical ventilation may be sudden.Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be assisted at home as far as possible, using telereporting assistance or other systems for communication whenever possible (e.g. WhatsApp, video, etc.).It is important to underline that:In the wait for a curative treatment or an effective vaccine, protection barriers are the best means for minimizing the impact of the epidemic [13].",
