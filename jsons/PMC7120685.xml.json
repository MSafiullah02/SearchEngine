Acute hypercapnic respiratory distress is the most frequent form, resulting from respiratory muscle fatigue associated with alveolar hypoventilation. Recurrent severe apnea occurs in 1.2\u201323.8 % of cases [3, 4]. The latest clinical presentation is predominantly alveolar and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [5]. Obstruction of the bronchioles increases the work of breathing (WOB), which represents the energy required to overcome the increased airway resistance. Infants, especially those born prematurely, are more prone to respiratory muscle fatigue. Prematurity, young age, and preexisting chronic respiratory and cardiac diseases are the main risk factors for severe bronchiolitis [1, 6]. When the WOB increases or persists for a long period, ventilatory support is required to prevent severe hypoxemia or hypercapnic coma.",

Some studies have reported the use of assisted spontaneous breathing (ASB) and biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) as other NIV modalities [7\u201312]. High-flow cannulas (HFCs) deliver positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) that can attain 3 or 5 cmH2O, and some studies suggested that it could obviate the need for endotracheal intubation [7, 8, 13\u201315]. There is no strong level of evidence that NIV avoids intubation and is beneficial for patients compared to intubation. During the last decade, however, increasing numbers of clinical and physiological studies have reported a good experience of NIV as the primary ventilatory support mode. Currently, CPAP is widely used as the first ventilatory support in many centers, with a decreasing rate of intubation.",

In infants, endotracheal intubation can be complicated by subglottic edema with a risk of evolution to tracheal stenosis. Mechanical ventilation of children with severe airway obstruction is challenging and may expose the airways and the lungs to high pressures or high volumes, causing lung injury. Most of infants who are mechanically ventilated require sedative drugs and sometimes muscle paralysis. The need for central venous access is common. These invasive procedures are associated with blood loss and expose children to nosocomial infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacteremia). The safety of sedative drugs in immature brains is not completely established. Hence, NIV represents a good alternative because its use rarely requires sedative drugs. On the other hand, the main risks of NIV are pneumonia aspiration in a child with an altered level of consciousness and potentially delayed intubation.",

Among the 520 infants admitted for bronchiolitis, 399 required ventilator assistance\u2014285 with a trial of NIV, mainly CPAP [9]. They reported a significant increase in the use of NIV (2.8 % increase per year) along with a decline in the intubation rate (1.9 % per year). The percentages of infants failing NIV decreased over the study period, from 31.8 to 13.5 %. This decline was also observed in centers in which NIV was widely used as the primary mode of ventilatory support [9]. In our center, for example, this percentage decreased from 33 to 5 % during the 2011\u20132012 epidemics (personal data). The median hospital LOS was longer for infants who were intubated and invasively ventilated than for those in whom NIV succeeded. The hospital LOS was also significantly longer for children who failed NIV than for those with invasive ventilation. The same tendency had been found in a previous study [10]. Even with no control study, these results suggested that a strategy using NIV (mainly CPAP) as the primary ventilatory support was able to obviate the need for tracheal intubation.",

A selection bias cannot completely be excluded because the level of severity of the infants treated is difficult to compare among studies.

Using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, they identified several thresholds: age < 11 weeks, SpO2 < 95 %, RR > 54, HR > 163, and GCS < 15. The strongest predictor was a low SpO2. The authors found a negative correlation between SpO2 and O2 requirement (r = \u22120.656), a positive correlation between age and weight (r = 0.836), and a positive correlation between gestational age and birth weight (r = 0.824).

Failure was defined as the need for intubation. Most of these studies included children with all types of respiratory distress, not bronchiolitis alone. The level of FiO2, ARDS and a high level of FiO2 (over 80 %) 1h after starting NIV were found as factors associated with NIV failure in children with severe respiratory distress of various causes [27, 28]. Larrar et al. identified the absence of a reduction in PCO2 as a predictive factor of NIV failure in a CPAP study. Abboud et al., in an HFC study, came to the same conclusion [11, 23]. A French prospective multicenter study noted that a minimal reduction in CO2 and a low increase in pH measured 2 or 4 h after NIV initiation were strong predictors of NIV failure [30]. In that study, the various centers had defined criteria for ventilatory support and absolute criteria for invasive ventilation (Tables 27.4 and 27.5). The results suggested that early assessment of the response to NIV is crucial.\n\n",

As nasal breathing has to be preserved, nasal obstruction, which frequently occurs during RSV infection, should be systematically treated and monitored. Nasal obstruction is a source of discomfort and agitation for children treated by nasal CPAP. Consequently, nasal lavage with NaCl 0.9 % every 3 or 4 h is recommended. The choice of the cannula\u2019s size is important to limit leaks and avoid nose injuries. It is recommended that nasal prongs of different sizes with different inter-nostril distances be readily available. To limit mouth leaks, a dummy is frequently used and sometimes a chinstrap is required. To avoid skin irritation or ulceration and to improve the patient\u2019s comfort, colloid ulcer dressings (e.g., Comfeel, Coloplast) are applied to protect the nasal bridge as well as the nostrils. In our experience, nasal prongs or cannulas are well tolerated by infants weighing up to 5 kg. For larger infants, nasal masks are often better tolerated.",

To minimize this phenomenon, a nasogastric tube is routinely inserted to deflate the stomach when necessary. In our clinical practice, when an infant is switched from CPAP to NIV on pressure support, we start with a level of PEEP equal to the level of CPAP used and then add pressure support of 6 cmH2O above PEEP or an inspiratory pressure of 6 plus PEEP. Then, after assessing the efficacy and tolerance, we adapt the ventilator setting or the interface, avoiding exceeding 20 cmH2O.

The sensitivity of ventilatory triggers is sometimes insufficient for young infants, who are unable to trigger a ventilatory cycle. On the contrary, when the sensitivity of the trigger is too high, and when the leaks are important, auto-triggering may appear, generating discomfort and asynchrony. Control of leakage is another factor contributing to synchrony: If the ventilator is unable to compensate for the leaks, the inspiratory time can be prolonged into the period when the child wants to expire. These causes of asynchrony are a source of discomfort and poor tolerance of NIV in infants.",
