Pooled Bcell mRNA transcriptomes from five CLL patients and five healthy donors were sequenced with 454 Life Sciences technology. Human reads were excluded by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and BLAT (BLAST-like alignment tool) searches. Remaining reads were screened with BLAST against viral databases. Purified B-cells from two CLL patients, with and without stimulation by phorbol-esters, were sequenced using Illumina technology to achieve depth of sequencing. Burrows-Wheeler Aligner mapping and BLAST searches were used for the Illumina data. Pyrosequencing resulted in about 400 000 reads per sample. No viral candidate could be found. Illumina single-end sequencing for 115 cycles yielded an average of 26 \u00b1 2\u00b75 million filtered reads per sample, of which 2\u00b72 \u00b1 0\u00b76 million remained unmapped to human references. BLAST searches of these reads against viral and human databases assigned nine reads to an Epstein-Barr virus origin, in one sample following phorbol-ester stimulation. Other reads showing a putative viral origin were dismissed after further analysis. Despite an in-depth analysis of the CLL transcriptome reaching more than 100 million sequences, we have not found evidence for a putative viral candidate in CLL.",

            "text": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukaemia in Western countries and mainly affects elderly individuals. It follows an extremely variable course, with survival ranging from months to decades. Available treatments often induce disease remission, but almost all patients will relapse and there is a consensus that CLL remains incurable. Multiple instances of the disease in some families and a low incidence among individuals of Japanese origin (including those who migrated to Hawaii), suggest that genetic influences are stronger than environmental factors in its pathogenesis (Weiss, 1979) . Genome-wide association studies have detected some loci influencing CLL risk (Sellick et al, 2007; Crowther-Swanepoel et al, 2010; Slager et al, 2011) and recent whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing studies addressed the repertoire of somatic mutations and other genetic lesions in the disease (Fabbri et al, 2011; Puente et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2011; Quesada et al, 2012) . Among the few genes found recurrently mutated, NOTCH1 and SF3B1 emerged as predictors of poor survival (Sportoletti et al, 2010; Fabbri et al, 2011; Puente et al, 2011; Rossi et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2011; Quesada et al, 2012) . Several studies have started to shed light on the nature of genetic predisposition of CLL, however none of the reported genetic aberrations (mutations, deletions or trisomies) have been shown to be a major cause of the disease and the basis of this disorder remains unknown (Sellick et al, 2007; Dighiero & Hamblin, 2008) .",

They include the DNA viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papilloma virus, hepatitis B virus and Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV-8), as well as RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C or human adult T cell leukaemia virus (HTLV). Class I or direct-transforming RNA tumour viruses carry cellular oncogenes but are not known to play any role in tumour causation in nature. Class II or chronic RNA tumour viruses do not carry cell-derived oncogenes but act through proviral DNA insertion into the immediate neighbourhood of a cellular oncogene. Feline, murine, and avian leukaemia viruses belong to this category. HTLV and Bovine Leukaemia Virus (BLV) expand the preneoplastic cell population through transactivation induced by viral Tax protein, thereby providing the seed for secondary cellular changes.",

This virus induces hyper lymphocytosis of CD5+ B-cells in a significant number of animals and causes aggressive disease in about 10% of cases (Gillet et al, 2007) . Despite this suggestive animal model, little research has been devoted to this issue by using classical polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and no known virus has been identified in the case of human CLL (Hermouet et al, 2003) . Attempts have been made to associate EBV with CLL, but accumulated data argue against a role of EBV in the early development of the disease and would only suggest a possible involvement in the generation of secondary malignancies (Tsimberidou et al, 2006; Dolcetti & Carbone, 2010; Tarrand et al, 2010) . Recent studies have also addressed the presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in CLL (Koljonen et al, 2009; Shuda et al, 2009; Pantulu et al, 2010; Tolstov et al, 2010; Teman et al, 2011) , but the results regarding MCPyV DNA are contradictory, showing extremely low MCPyV copy number if detected. Given the high seroprevalence of this virus in the analysed populations and the progressive immunodeficiency associated to CLL, MCPyV detection might be more likely explained by background infection or low-level viral reactivation in CLL-induced immunodeficiency (Koljonen et al, 2009; Shuda et al, 2009; Pantulu et al, 2010; Tolstov et al, 2010; Teman et al, 2011) .",

Such efforts fail, however, when the agents in question are truly novel or sufficiently distant in sequence from related agents to allow hybridization, or if they are poorly expressed at the RNA level. The advent of high-throughput sequencing in combination with bioinformatics analysis could pave the way to the discovery of new infectious pathogens. This approach led to the identification of a new species of arenavirus in patients suffering from an infectious disease for which a causative pathogen could not be detected using any of the available diagnostic procedures (Palacios et al, 2008) . Similarly, the novel MCPyV was characterized from Merkel cell carcinoma samples and recognized as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis (Feng et al, 2008) . Thus, this methodology is suitable for applications in which the infectious pathogen is unknown. In the current study, we searched for the presence of a virus expressed at the RNA level in human CLL, by using massive sequencing technology associated with a digital transcriptome subtraction method.",

We therefore decided to study two additional patients using Illumina sequencing technology, which offers greatly increased depth at the expense of shorter read length. Both patients were diagnosed with a progressive malignancy, even in the IgG non-mutated case (Table I) . Two substantial improvements in this dataset were the preparation of libraries from normalized total RNA (rather than only poly-adenylated mRNAs) and a 90-fold increase in the amount of reads, enabling the detection of transcripts with very low expression level. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that the virus could be integrated in the genome and barely transcribed, we analysed the isolated cells prior to and after treatment with phorbol- ester, a potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator (Blumberg, 1988) . Illumina sequencing yielded 36 \u00b1 2\u00b77 million raw reads per sample, from which 26 \u00b1 2\u00b75 million reads per sample remained after filtering steps (Table II, Data S1). As previously mentioned, given this very large amount of sequence data, changes to the mapping tools and final BLAST searches of the subtraction pipeline were necessary. To begin with, we used Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li & Durbin, 2009) to discard reads of human origin by successive mapping to ribosomal RNAs, the human genome and transcriptome databases. A summary of BWA mapping results (Table II) shows that the ribosomal content of our total RNA libraries was 18\u00b70% \u00b1 3\u00b73%, a figure comparable to other ribosomal depletion protocols. Regarding non-ribosomal reads, 67\u00b73% \u00b1 6\u00b72% and 7\u00b72% \u00b1 0\u00b76% aligned to genome and transcriptome databases respectively, while 2\u00b72 \u00b1 0\u00b76 million reads remained unmapped.",

Most reads matching viral sequences mapped anti-sense to the primer binding site (PBS) of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). At its 5\u2032 end, this primate betaretrovirus carries two long terminal repeats separated by 63 nucleotides complementary to tRNA-Lys, the usual primer for reverse transcription of the viral genome (Sonigo et al, 1986) . Further analysis revealed that these reads would be chimeric-like sequences, where the first stretch of the read derives from human tRNA-Lys precursors and the following region is variable (Data S1 and Fig S3) . As supported by the absence of additional MPMV reads in our transcriptomes (i.e., reads aligning to MPMV genome loci other than PBS), we definitively excluded a true viral origin for these reads (Data S1). Other reads showing a putative viral origin were also dismissed because: (i) they aligned to viral genomes with qualities not better than to human [most of them were classified as human by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), although with a posterior probability lower than 0\u00b79]; (ii) had low complexity repeats; (iii) were unknown to be related to human disease (see Grouper iridovirus, Sindbis virus, Glypta fumiferanae and a Lausannevirus isolate in online supplementary Data S2). Finally, nine reads from one of the two phorbol-ester activated samples (Table III and Data S2) showed high similarity to the Epstein-Barr virus genome (EBV), in a region of the BcLF1 gene. In this case, alignments to the EBV genome involved the full length of the reads with non-hits to neither human genome nor transcriptome. Thus, these nine reads were considered to have a true viral origin.",

In addition, we focused on two wellknown genes in CLL disease: ADAM29 and LPL. Specifically, these genes are known to be differentially expressed in mutated and unmutated CLL patients respectively, showing an opposite behaviour between them (Oppezzo et al, 2005) . Raw read counts from the 454 assay (pool of unmutated patients) could only detect seven reads for LPL and one read for ADAM29. Meanwhile, Illumina technology accounted for 477 reads for LPL and only one read for ADAM29, in the case of the unmutated sample. For the mutated patient, Illumina raw read counts were one and 420 for LPL and ADAM29, respectively. Notably, these expected LPL/ADAM29 expression ratios could only be detected by Illumina sequencing, demonstrating the higher resolution of this method.",

In this respect, Illumina sequencing paired with a digital subtraction strategy has recently been shown to be sensitive enough to mine RNA-Seq libraries with decreasing amounts of a spiked RNA-virus (Moore et al, 2011) . Recently, small RNA Illumina sequencing also proved suitable for discovering viruses in plants and insects, a strategy based on the small interfering RNA (siR-NA) immune response that these organisms trigger against virus infection (Kreuze et al, 2009; Wu et al, 2010; Ma et al, 2011) .",

To analyse the putative involvement of a viral agent in its onset, we conducted two surveys on CLL transcriptomes acquired by massively parallel sequencing technologies. First, we applied digital subtraction of human sequences to 454 sequencing data for a polyApositive RNA from a pool of five CLL patients. To improve sensitivity, we then prepared paired samples of B-cells with and without prior treatment with a potent cell activator for two additional patients. Normalized libraries for total RNA were sequenced with Illumina technology, increasing the data yield over 454 sequencing. As we have shown, this approach allowed an important increase in transcript detection, very pronounced for genes expressed at low levels. Nine reads of viral origin (EBV) were detected in one activated sample. EBV prevalence in humans is approximately 90% and the evidence accumulated so far strongly support its involvement in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of human malignancies, particularly in the case of immunocompromised patients (Thompson & Kurzrock, 2004) . As for the role of EBV in CLL development, EBV infection has been demonstrated to only play a role in the case of secondary malignancies, generally involving a new clone (Tsimberidou et al, 2006; Dolcetti & Carbone, 2010; Tarrand et al, 2010) . Thus, given available data, the assignment of nine reads to an EBV origin were considered neither unexpected nor relevant to this work.",

The discovery of HTLV-1 and its role in adult T cell leukaemia confirmed that retroviruses can also be oncogenic in humans, initiating extensive research on retroviral aetiology of human chronic diseases and cancer. A caveat of our study is the fact that a retroviral candidate of CLL would not be detectable using this strategy if it shows high similarity to human endogenous retroviral (HERV) sequences, allowing reads to be mapped to the human genome assembly and not further analysed (Voisset et al, 2008) . Also, a HERV transcribed and related to CLL would not be detected by our pipeline. However, it is worth mentioning that the bovine analogous model of CLL is produced by a deltaretrovirus (BLV). As there are no HERVs related to deltaretroviruses, we did not expect to specifically face these confounding factors. Furthermore, with the single exceptions of HIV and HTLV, the role of retroviruses in human diseases remains highly controversial (Voisset et al, 2008; Weiss, 2010) . For instance, the last of the RNA 'rumour' viruses, the Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus, seems to have been erroneously related to disease as consequence of a contaminant artefact (Robinson et al, 2011; Simmons et al, 2011) .",

Although this search was conducted with two powerful, up-to-date technologies, our data do not definitively exclude a viral origin for human CLL because the existence of a novel virus sufficiently distant in sequence from any related agents would be difficult to detect. Given that our study included a limited number of patients, we cannot exclude that an infectious agent could be found in a small percentage of patients, as we cannot exclude the possibility that the virus could operate as a hit and run agent. Also, an infectious agent might operate indirectly through attacking microenvironment cells.",
