Among the most advanced diagnostic tools is the immunochemical method, based on the use of highly pathogen-specific antibodies. An important task in antibody and vaccine preparation is to choose an optimal carrier (delivery system) that would ensure a high immune response. Such adjuvant carriers can deposit antigens at the injection sites, enhance their presentation to immunocompetent cells, and induce the production of necessary cytokines. Particularly promising in this regard are various nanoscale particle carriers [1\u201316]. Such nanocarriers can be used as adjuvants in the preparation of antibodies and next-generation vaccines. The term \u2018nanovaccinology\u2019 [17] is coming into common scientific use.",

In this context, of undoubted interest is the study of the interaction of nanoparticles with phagocytic cells, the mechanisms of intracellular penetration, and the response of immune cells to nanoparticles [39]. Depending on their size, nanoparticles penetrate macrophages through receptor-mediated endocytosis (phagocytosis) or pinocytosis and are localized mainly in lysosomes and in perinuclear space. Often, they are wrapped inside fringed vesicles. Some researchers believe that a key part in nanoparticle uptake by macrophages is played by scavenger receptors [40,41]. Nanoparticle penetration into macrophages may enhance the respiratory activity of the cells and, in some cases, the release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines, prostaglandins, etc.) and the activation of the immune response genes [42,43].",

For tick-borne encephalitis virus and other flaviviruses, a slowly sedimenting virus-specific antigen was described that had complement-binding activity, was not associated with the virion fraction, and did not have infectivity or hemagglutinating activity. This antigen was called a soluble antigen [78]. The vaccine was prepared by conjugating GNPs (average diameter, 15 nm) to the soluble antigen. White laboratory mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally three times, each at 32 \u03bcg of antigen per injection. The protective properties of the experimental and commercial vaccines were compared on the basis of the average survival time and the protection coefficients after vaccination of mice challenged with a virus-containing suspension (100,000 and 10,000 LD50). The survival time and the therapeutic and protective efficacy obtained when the experimental vaccine was used were about 1.5 times greater than when the commercial vaccine was used.",

The synthetic peptide M2e, a conserved extracellular domain of influenza virus matrix protein 2 conjugated to 12-nm GNPs, was used as an immunogen (Figure 2). As an adjuvant, soluble CpG (cytosine\u2013phosphate\u2013guanosine) oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) was used. BALB/C mice were immunized twice at an interval of 21 days, each time with 8.2 \u03bcg of M2e per animal. The conjugate induced the production of specific IgG (with stimulation of subtypes of both IgG1 and IgG2a), which could recognize M2e and native M2 on influenza a viruses and had a protective effect against a lethal dose of PR8-H1N1 virus. Subsequently, Gill\u2019s group published more detailed results from the use of the proposed prototype vaccine to induce protective immunity against the influenza a virus serotypes H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 [85,86]. Bimler et al. [87] showed that even at 15 months after being vaccinated with the GNP/M2e+CpG conjugate, the mice retained high titers of M2e-specific antibodies. These mice were protected against lethal H1N1 influenza. In addition, the antibody titers increased after a challenge with influenza a and remained elevated for 3 months. This suggests that old mice retain effective M2e-specific memory B cells.\n",

It is known that when CpG motifs are unmethylated, they act as immunostimulants [89]. The immunostimulatory activity of synthetic ODNs containing CpG sequences may be similar to the activity of bacterial DNA [90]. According to Wei et al. [91], GNPs coupled to CpG ODNs effectively enhance the intracellular penetration of nanoparticles into macrophages and significantly increase the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines \u2013 tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-6. Moreover, the immunostimulatory effect of GNPs conjugated to CpG ODNs is often significantly higher than that of the same concentrations of soluble CpG ODNs [92,93]. Of note, the optimal immunization method is the simultaneous use of two conjugates: GNPs\u2013antigen and CpG ODNs\u2013GNPs [94] (Figure 3). The immune response to an intranasal influenza vaccination can be enhanced with gold nanorods coupled to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid as an adjuvant, as well as with CpG [95].\n",

Bioaccumulated GNPs can interfere with different diagnostic techniques, or accumulated GNPs can exhibit catalytic properties. All these concerns, together with potential toxicity, are big limitations of GNPs on a successfully clinical translation. Nowadays, despite the huge numbers of studies regarding the synthesis and functionalization of GNPs (different shapes, coatings, sizes, charges, etc.), there are very few nanomaterial-based pharmaceuticals on the market.",

The advantages of nanoparticles of this type are that they are utilized well in the organism, the target substance is highly efficiently involved, there is a higher capability to overcome different physiological barriers, and there are less systematic side effects. The action mechanisms of biodegradable nanoparticles and GNPs as carriers of antigens in the immune system are probably similar. These two types of nanoobjects can compete in the development of a new generation of vaccines, taking into account data on bioinertness, low toxicity, and the good excretion of gold nanoparticles from the organism with the involvement of a hepatobiliary system [147].",
