It has compelled clinicians to re-examine our roles as physicians, educators, family members and citizens. Consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists stand at the convergence of psychiatry and the rest of medicine. Like most medical specialties, C-L psychiatry is forced to adapt during the pandemic, possibly bringing permanent changes to our profession.",

Although the gold-standard of consultation involves in-person evaluation of the patient, it is clear that this crisis calls for the use of technology to decrease viral transmission. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of telemedicine when possible, limits on the number of staff providing care to COVID-19+ patients, and use of dedicated healthcare providers who care only for COVID+ patients during a shift.1 It would be simple to reflexively respond to this challenge by insisting that our service, in its fully staffed form, is an indispensable entity in the hospital. After all, we care for extraordinarily sick patients, we rely on physical exam findings including a thorough neurological exam, and we manage conditions, such as hyperactive delirium, catatonia and severe alcohol withdrawal, which require frequent visual assessments.",

One of the most challenging skills for trainees to master is determining the extent of involvement required for a specific consult. Trainees must learn to be thorough, avoid premature closure, and resist tunnel-vision focused on the specific consult question. They must recognize that not every consultation requires a soup-to-nuts evaluation, understanding the value in a brief, focused assessment. A hybrid approach to patient care on the C-L service, with some evaluations completed by chart review, telephone encounter or video, creates an opportunity for trainees to learn valuable lessons about triage.",

As such, medical center leadership will look to us as experts in mental healthcare delivery systems. Most of the care that we provide as psychiatrists, across all settings, remains poorly understood by hospital administration. It is therefore essential to recognize that the tone set by C-L psychiatry, as the \u201cface\u201d of mental health, may inform the facility\u2019s entire approach to mental healthcare delivery during crisis. C-L psychiatry teams must gracefully step into this unofficial leadership role deliberately modeling a well-informed, flexible, and balanced approach. Whatever is \u201clost\u201d (pride, sense of \u201cpatient ownership\u201d, etc.) by stepping down from face-to-face clinical interaction can be gained through the demonstration of courageous leadership.",

Our training and experience allow us to reach into the most uncomfortable psychic places within ourselves, and to assist others in the same, without shame. Clinicians are combatting the ultimate in moral injury, unable to provide the high-quality healthcare they were trained to do, sometimes fighting within healthcare systems that were disadvantaged from the start. Never has the C-L psychiatry role been so important to support and hold the therapeutic container for the caregivers of medicine. What we may or may-not prove now in face-to-face respiratory management of a complex COVID-19 ventilator weaning, we will prove with a nuanced approach to the intricacies of the healthcare system and the people within.",
