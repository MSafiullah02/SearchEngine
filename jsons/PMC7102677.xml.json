Despite the presence of clinical suspicion in a majority of the MERS-CoV cases [3,4], delays in diagnosis and seeking prompt medical care remain common among MERS-CoV patients [5]. A South Korean study reported substantial lag duration between suspected clinical symptom onset and MERS-CoV laboratory confirmation, with a median of 6.5 days on 37 MERS-CoV infection cases [6].",

A large proportion of the MERS-CoV patients are older [5], which indicates the necessity of prompt investigation to reduce health-system delay in this vulnerable group. Saudi Arabia as a reporting country was a significant predictor of shorter diagnostic, patient, and health-system delays. Unlike the other countries, Saudi Arabia has experienced multiple MERS-CoV outbreaks, and the majority (83%) of cases reported were from Saudi Arabia (WHO, 2018). The lessons learned from these outbreaks may help the health system in Saudi Arabia to improve clinical experience in detection, diagnosis, and management of new MERS-CoV cases [13].",

Significant findings in this study must be interpreted carefully, as it indicates correlation rather than causation. Patient and health-system delays were calculated using the date of first hospitalization rather than the date of first consultation in a health facility or a first doctor\u2019s visit. Despite these limitations, this is the first study to assess the source of MERS-CoV diagnostic delays (patient and health-system). Early diagnosis of MERS-CoV [3] and its delay [5] continues to be a major challenge, since neither has been sufficiently discussed in previous literature. Furthermore, the study identified several potential interventions related to the decision-making process at patient, doctor, and health-system levels to shorten avoidable delays in the MERS-CoV diagnosis process following symptoms and first doctor visit.",
