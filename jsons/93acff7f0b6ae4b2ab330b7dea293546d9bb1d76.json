On the condition of meeting the timeliness requirement of emergency logistics, the study of emergency logistics distribution can rationally schedule vehicle, substantially reduce the vehicle allocation time and the logistical cost. Through the analysis of the characteristics of rescue emergency logistics, the system structure of emergency logistics distribution is proposed. After the material distribution optimization model for emergency logistics is established, an improved genetic algorithm is designed to solve this problem. In improved genetic algorithm, the best individual reservations, roulette selection, blend crossover, and blend mutation have been adopted to avoid premature convergence and enhance the process efficiency. A numeric example is presented to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the model and its algorithm.",

Eldessouki [3] studied the emergency supplies distribution problems for the objective of minimizing transportation costs under different constraint conditions. Dai and Da [4] presented the model of multiresource emergency problem according to the characteristics of multiresource and multigarage problem and obtained the solution by citing the concept of continuous feasible and using the results of single resource problem. Liu and He [5] studied the emergency supplies scheduling problems with multigarage on the constraint condition of material requirement. According to the characteristics of consecutive emergency, an emergency model aiming at minimizing the succor nodes was established respectively under the precondition of best emergency in response to times and the restriction periods. Kejun and Wang [6] classified the burst events in the process of logistics and distribution as three categories: the effect on the state of goods, vehicles and the state of the road status raised the static, dynamic, and the functional model based on burst events. Zhang et al. [7] proposed a multiobjective multiperiod emergency logistics model to deal with Split-delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (SDVRP), and aimed to minimize the unsatisfied demand, total delivery time and supply unbalance among demanders. Sen Chen et al. [8] considered the repair of the destroyed roadways from the view of transformation between material relief and the delay of logistics distribution, and gets the best solution according to the purpose of the decision maker through roadway network and vehicle routing combinative optimization.",

The first layer is garages, all vehicles needed with different types set out from this layer and the number of the vehicles has known in advance. The second layer is emergency supplies warehouses, including local storehouses at all levels, railway stations, airports, and docks. There are several categories of emergency supplies and their quantity at each storehouse is known and does not change during the emergency respond periods. The bottom layer is the disaster sites, namely, the destination of the whole emergency logistics distribution. Once the disaster bursts, each disaster site will generate certain number of emergency supply demands for every type of emergency supplies after disaster assessment, and each emergency supply warehouse will deploy certain numbers of vehicles according to the demands of the affected areas to deliver the emergency supplies. There only exists vehicle flows between the first layer and the second layer without material flows. That is to say, the vehicles are running empty and on single orientation, transport from garages to emergency supply warehouses and not return to garages during the emergency respond times. There are both vehicle flows and material flows between the second layer and third layer, the material flows from the second to the third is one-way, while vehicles are in two-ways between the two levels. When vehicles arrive at the disaster sites, they do not return to the garage immediately but wait at the disaster site for new orders. Once there is a new assignment they will return to material warehouses to deliver the emergency supplies again. Thus, there are two states after the vehicles transport from material warehouses to disaster sites, one is waiting at the disaster site for new order, the other is returning to the emergency supplies warehouses to begin next distribution after receiving a new assignment and, as the dotted line in Fig. 45 .1, the vehicles are running converse empty.",

On the other hand, it reflects the characteristic that the emergency logistics distribution is oriented by the demand of disaster sites, which aims at meeting the need of the disaster sites and shortens the distribution time as soon as possible in order to cut down the losses of affected areas and the vehicle running costs.

The probability of change named mutation probability. Common methods of mutation are basic position, reverse, and uniform mutation [12] . This algorithm takes the uniform, combined boundary, and nonuniform mutation, and the total variation percentage in the number is 3:3:4. This can prevent excellent genes in variability being damaged, but also introduce a new gene for the population on the local optimal solutions.",

As a result, the model and its algorithm are suitable for solving logistic distribution optimization under practical large-scale emergency logistics. ",
