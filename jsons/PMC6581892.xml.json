Expected findings were based on the results of a previous dose-ranging study of RV-A16 (Lot 1086) that was grown with standard techniques and tested in 2000\u20132001 in which an infecting dose of 1000 TCID50/mL was associated with median (11 of 39) and mean (11.4 of 39) peak symptom scores in the moderate range and at least 75% of subjects with moderate-to-severe colds (Table 3). The expected sample size for the optimal dose or closest available dose ranged from 9 to 10 subjects. The probability that no cohort will receive the closest available dose to the target was 1.4% or less in all but 1 scenario. The relationship between dose (log-transformed) and the rate of colds of at least moderate intensity (maximal weekly symptom score of \u22657 of 39 on the modified Jackson criteria) after inoculation was assessed using logistic regression models. The logistic regression equation will be solved for the optimal dose, eg, the dose for which the estimated rate of moderate-to-severe colds is 75%.",

The viral RNA was extracted, and overlapping cDNA segments of the viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned, and sequenced. The cloned cDNA segments with the consensus sequences were selected and then assembled in a stepwise fashion into 1 cDNA clone with the full-length viral genome (Supplemental Figure 3).

This is an important feature because picornaviruses that are serially passaged in tissue culture adapt quickly to cultured cells that can change their functional characteristics [30].

Some of the delays were due to regulatory changes that were prompted by the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic, raising concerns about introducing a virus into the wild that had been synthesized in the laboratory, albeit from wild-type sequences. In addition, the detection of porcine circovirus in a live-attenuated rotavirus vaccine in 2010 [32] led to additional requirements for testing of the viral inoculum for bovine and porcine viruses that could theoretically be introduced by animal products (eg, serum) used to manufacture RG-RV-A16. Now that RG procedures for RV have been established, production of additional viral vaccines or inocula using recombinant techniques should be straightforward. Once the virus is cloned, production is a 2-day process. One significant delay in the traditional production process of inocula grown from nasal secretions is that the virus donor must undergo thorough testing for other infectious agents, and a 1-year follow-up is recommended [13]. Using a cloned virus instead of nasal secretions as the source of the seed virus obviates this 1-year delay.",
