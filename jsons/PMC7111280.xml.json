In this paper, a rather underrepresented 3\u2032-C-ethynylribofuranose motif [[15], [16], [17], [18]] was used as the sugar scaffold to construct a small library of nucleoside analogs. Previous reports mainly focused on pyrimidine (-like) nucleobase moieties [17,19], structurally resembling the cytidine analog, ECyd (1, Fig. 1\n), which emerged as the most promising derivative from the initial discovery of 3\u2032-C-ethynyl nucleosides in 1996 [15]. ECyd has been evaluated in clinical trials as a new antitumoral agent [3] and recently attracted renewed interest as a combination therapy, e.g. with carboplatin [3], or as part of a \u2018duplex drug\u2019, in which it is linked to 2\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine [20].",

Switching to the benzoate protected sugar derivative 18 [15] improved the coupling yields [27], but the isolated glycosylation products were contaminated with residues of glycosyl donor degradation products (tentative assignment based on 1H NMR data; not shown). Treatment of the crude intermediates 19\u201322 with NH3/MeOH [27] (or NH4OH [28]) at elevated (>100 \u00b0C) temperatures caused decomposition. Therefore, an alternative protocol to introduce the 6-amino group was employed [29,30]. Nucleophilic displacement of the 6-chloride with sodium azide efficiently delivered the corresponding azide derivatives (23\u201326), which generally could be obtained in pure form due to the marked difference in polarity induced by the predominating tetrazolo tautomer. Staudinger reduction furnished the corresponding 6-amino derivatives. Deprotection afforded the final compounds (31, 32, 33, 34). To dehalogenate the 7-iodo intermediate 26, it was subjected to I/Mg exchange using Knochel's iPrMgCl.LiCl [26,31], and the magnesiated intermediate was quenched with aqueous acid to give 35 in good yield. Further conversion to 37 was realized as described above. Introduction of a furan-2-yl moiety was achieved via an aqueous Suzuki reaction on 34 [25]. Remarkably, Suzuki reaction on the 7-iodo-7-deazapurine substrate gave significantly lower yields than reaction with the 6-chloropurine starting material.",

The presence of a 3\nJ\nH-1\u2032-C-8 cross peak in the 1H-13C gHMBC spectrum of compound 48 (see Supporting Information) allowed to ascertain glycosylation at N9 (N7). However, a large coupling constant (J = 37.8 Hz) observed for C8 (C6) was inconsistent with the CF3 group being attached to C7 (C5). This led us to assign the structure of the trifluoromethylated compound prepared using Langlois' reagent as the C8 (C6) regio-isomer. The C7 (C5) substituted heterocycle 42 could be obtained from the known C7 (C5) iodide 40 [34] by subsequent N-Boc protection and trifluoromethylation using the Ruppert reagent [37] (the N-Boc protecting group was lost during the reaction). Comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of both regioisomers 39 and 42 (see Supporting Information) led to the confirmation that 39 and thus also 48, are the C8 (C6) substituted isomers. Of note, a recent patent application [38] described both regio-isomers 39 and 42, in which the regiochemical assignment is opposite to our conclusions. The C7 substituted heterocycle 42 was used to synthetize the desired product 49, following the same reaction sequence as above.",

Remarkably, 3\u2032-C-ethynyl-7-deaza-adenosine (3\u2032-C-ethynyltubercidin) 37, as well as its 7-halogenated analogs 31\u201334 inhibited the proliferation of the different tumor cell lines with nanomolar IC50 values. The chloro (32) and bromo (33) analogs showed the highest antiproliferative activity irrespective of the cell line studied, while unsubstituted derivative 37 showed similar activity as EAdo (5). Interestingly, the observed structure-antiproliferative activity relationship from this small subset significantly differs from that observed for the corresponding ribofuranose derivatives [25]. Furan-2-yl substituted analog 38 was found to only weakly inhibit tumor cell proliferation, which contrasts to the potent activity observed for the corresponding 7-(furan-2-yl)-7-deazaadenosine [25]. Similarly, the 7-ethynyl analog 54 only showed weak antiproliferative activity, which also contrasts with the activity observed for the corresponding ribofuranose analog [25]. Saturation of the ethynyl substituent as in 59, resulted in two orders of magnitude lower IC50's than those for 32.",

Their spectrum of activity was thoroughly investigated (except for 49) by assaying against the NCI-60 panel, which also revealed nanomolar activity against several solid tumor derived cell lines. Removal of the N7 nitrogen and introduction of substitutions at C7 (particularly halogens, derivatives 31\u201334) was shown to lead to significantly more potent antiproliferative nucleosides than the C2/C6 modified derivatives we have previously reported. Additionally, analogs 31\u201334 potently inhibited proliferation of endothelial cell types, which could be particularly interesting for the treatment of solid tumors. As a proof-of-concept, analog 32 was investigated in a metastatic breast cancer xenograft mouse model. This derivative inhibited both tumor growth as well as metastasis as assessed by means of BLI.

Exact mass measurements were performed on a Waters LCT Premier XE\u2122 Time of Flight (ToF) mass spectrometer equipped with a standard electrospray (ESI) and modular Lockspray\u2122 interface. Samples were infused in a MeCN/water (1:1) + 0.1% formic acid mixture at 100 \u03bcL/min. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are given in ppm and spectra are referenced to the residual solvent peak. Coupling constants are given in Hz. In 19F NMR, signals were referenced to CDCl3 or DMSO\u2011d\n6 lock resonance frequency according to IUPAC referencing with CFCl3 set to 0 ppm. After glycosylation, both the correct stereochemistry at C1\u2019 (\u03b2) and the correct regiochemistry (N9; purine numbering) of the glycosylation products was ascertained by means of 2D NMR techniques (2D NOESY, 1H-13C gHMBC, respectively), either on the protected or on the deprotected derivative (depending on peak resolution). Melting points were determined on a B\u00fcchi-545 apparatus and are uncorrected. Purity was assessed by means of analytical LC-MS employing either:(1)Waters Alliance 2695 XE separation Module using a Phenomenex Luna\u00ae reversed-phase C18 (2) column (3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00d7 2.00 mm) and a gradient system of HCOOH in H2O (0.1%, v/v)/HCOOH in MeCN (0.1%, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, 10:90 to 0:100 in 9 min. High-resolution MS spectra were recorded on a Waters LCT Premier XE Mass spectrometer.(2)Waters AutoPurification system (equipped with ACQUITY QDa (mass; 100\u20131000 amu)) and 2998 Photodiode Array (220\u2013400 nm)) using a Waters Cortecs\u00ae C18 (2.7 \u03bcm 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm) column and a gradient system of HCOOH in H2O (0.2%, v/v)/MeCN at a flow rate of 1.44 mL/min, 95:05 to 00:100 in 6.5 min.\n",
