Infected hosts may develop respiratory, enteric, hepatic or neurological diseases with different degrees of severity. Prior to the 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak triggered by a previously unknown coronavirus (Drosten et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003), human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43 were recognized as the two primary coronaviruses causing upper respiratory tract infections associated with severe pulmonary diseases in elderly, newborn, and immunocompromised individuals (Garbino et al., 2006). Results from one study involving a large collection of human nasopharyngeal specimens suggest that HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1 are the only coronaviruses circulating in human populations (Zlateva et al., 2013). However, more recent studies of fatal human infections by a novel SARS-like coronavirus named MERS-CoV have been reported (Zaki et al., 2012). This is a reminder that novel coronaviruses can emerge and cause life-threatening infectious diseases, although most human coronavirus infections result in mild symptoms such as those associated with the common cold.",

The protein is known to associate with lipid rafts on cell surfaces and at the internal membrane, likely with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Kupzig et al., 2003). One model suggests that BST2 inhibits virion release by tethering nascent virions to cell surfaces via its amino-terminal transmembrane domain and carboxy-terminal GPI anchor (Neil et al., 2008, Perez-Caballero et al., 2009). Treatment with a protease such as subtilisin can support virion release, presumably via proteolytic BST2 cleavages linking budding virions to cell surfaces (Neil et al., 2006).",

Coronavirus assembly and budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Hunter, 2001). Vesicles containing accumulated coronavirus particles are transported to the plasma membrane, where they release virions exocytotically (Masters, 2006). The goal of our research was to determine whether BST2 also affects the release of coronaviruses whose budding processes differ from those of most other enveloped viruses. We selected HCoV-229E, a common human coronavirus, as a representative strain. Our results suggest that BST2 is capable of counteracting HCoV-229E infection via the tethering of nascent progeny virions at the cell surface. Our data also support the idea that BST2 is capable of restricting the virus particle release of different enveloped virus families.",

We then established a stable BST2 knockdown HeLa cell line (HeLa/BST2-), and observed that it exerted an effect similar to that of the transient BST2 knockdown in terms of promoting HCoV-229E production (Fig. 1B). When tested with a Vpu-deleted HIV-1 clone (known to be restricted by BST2 in the absence of the Vpu viral protein), the BST2 knockdown resulted in the release of a larger quantity of virus particles (Fig. 1C); this is consistent with previous reports (Goffinet et al., 2010, Neil et al., 2008).",

Results indicate that BST2 knockdown is capable of elevating HCoV-229E levels in supernatants when normalized to cell-associated N levels (Fig. 1F, lane 7 vs. lane 5). Similar results from independent experiments were observed. BST2 expression in A549 cells was barely induced by IFN\u03b1 following HCoV-229E infection (Fig. 1F, lane 5 vs. lane 2), suggesting that HCoV-229E counteracts the capability of IFN\u03b1 to induce BST2 expression or expresses certain factors against BST2. IFN\u03b1 does not significantly enhance BST2 expression in HCoV-229E-infected cells to restrict virus egress\u2014in other words, the effect of BST2 knockdown on virus egress enhancement is marginal. According to these data, it is difficult to conclude whether HCoV-229E egress is significantly restricted by IFN\u03b1-induced BST2. Our observation of a noticeable reduction in virus egress following IFN\u03b1 treatment (Fig. 1D) could be due, at least in part, to the time of sample analysis (see \u201cDiscussion\u201d section).",

HeLa cells with or without BST2 knockdown were inoculated with HCoV-229E at 0.1 MOI. Virus titers at various times post-infection were determined by A549 cell plaque assays. At 10 h post-infection and later, HeLa cells produced viral titers at levels significantly lower than HeLa/BST2- (\nFig. 2A). Between 7 and 9 h post-inoculation, HeLa/BST2- cells produced higher virus titers, but not at a statistically significant level. Plaque morphologies of A549 cells infected with virions released from HeLa/BST2- or HeLa cells were similar (data not shown). However, we repeatedly observed that the sizes of viral plaques on HeLa/BST2\u2010 cells were larger than those on HeLa cells following HCoV-229E infection, despite the lack of major differences in plaque numbers between the two cell types (Fig. 2B). Larger plaque sizes observed on HeLa/BST2\u2010 cells were likely the result of the spreading of nascent progeny virions to adjacent cells rather than increased susceptibility to HCoV-229E infection. To verify the lack of major impacts of BST2 knockdown on HCoV-229E susceptibility or entry, we examined viral protein expression in both HeLa/BST2- and HeLa cells at various times post-HCoV-229E infection. As shown in\nFig. 3A, HeLa/BST2- and HeLa cells had approximately equal numbers of fluorescent-positive viral nucleocapsid protein cells at 4 h post-infection. However, at 6 h post-infection and later there was a much larger number of fluorescent-positive HeLa/BST2- cells compared to HeLa cells\u2014an increase likely due to the spread of nascent progeny virions. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B). Combined, the data suggest that BST2 knockdown does not significantly affect HeLa cell susceptibility to HCoV-229E, but markedly affects progeny virus yields.",

This is in agreement with the notion that BST2 is a major component of innate immunity against enveloped virus replicative infections. Both transient and stable expression of BST2 knockdown resulted in the marked enhancement of HCoV-229E progeny virus titer quantities. Electron microscope observations indicate an association with virus particle clusters at cell surfaces in the presence of BST2 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Immunogold labeling results indicate that BST2 molecules enhanced the linking of virions to each other or to cell membranes (Fig. 5), suggesting that HCoV-229E virions are restricted to membranes by BST2 during budding in ER/Golgi compartments. The primary site of BST2 antiviral activity is thought to be the cell surface, where many viruses acquire their envelopes by directly budding from the plasma membrane (Le Tortorec et al., 2011, Swiecki et al., 2013). However, some enveloped viruses such as herpesviruses (which complete their final envelopment by obtaining membranes from TGN and/or endosomal compartments and egress via exocytosis), are also subject to BST2 restrictions Mansouri et al., 2009; Mettenleiter, 2002). Results from one recent study suggest that BST2 can moderately restrict the release of hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly takes place in the ER, and whose release from cells occurs via secretory pathways in a fashion similar to that of coronaviruses (Dafa-Berger et al., 2012, Jones and McLauchlan, 2010). It is possible that virions linked to vesicle membranes via BST2 association are retained on cell surfaces following the exocytotic fusion of virion-containing vesicles with plasma membranes. This finding, plus the inhibition of enveloped virus budding at the plasma membrane, suggests that BST2 is also capable of inhibiting virus budding at intracellular membranes.",

We have no direct evidence suggesting that HCoV-229E infection can significanly downregulate IFN\u03b1-induced BST2; however, our data suggest that HCoV-229E-infected A549 cells can counteract the ability of IFN\u03b1 to trigger BST2 expression. This scenario is similar to the intial phase of HCoV-229E infection of respiratroy tract cells, which express very low or undetectable levels of basal BST2 (Erikson et al., 2011). Once cells are infected by HCoV-229E, BST2 expression is downregulated, even in the presence of subsequently induced IFN. As a result, HCoV-229E egress is unrestricted.",

            "text": "We consistently observed that HeLa cell infections with HCoV-229E at low MOIs (0.01\u20131.0) did not trigger significant changes in total or cell surface BST2 expression 24 h post-infection. However, total or surface BST2 levels in HeLa cells were markedly reduced at an infection MOI of 5.0 (Fig. 4A, lane 5 and Fig. 6). This suggests that BST2 downregulation following HCoV-229E infection is MOI-dependent. Bampi et al. have reported the mediation of BST2 degradation by Sendai virus (SeV) glycoproteins; however, significant total BST2 downregulation in HeLa cells at 24 h post-infection requires inoculation at 20 MOI (Bampi et al., 2013). They therefore concluded that BST2 degradation requires a threshold of viral proteins. It is likely that at shorter time periods post-infection and/or at low MOIs, BST2 antagonist expression by HCoV-229E is insufficient to counteract the effects of BST2. Since HCoV-229E egress becomes unrestricted after longer infection periods, the elevation of virus egress by BST2 knockdown becomes unnecessary. This may explain, at least in part, why we did not observe significant improvement in HCoV-229E egress due to the siRNA knockdown of BST2 at 48 h post-infection (Fig. 1F); at this point, IFN\u03b1-induced BST2 may have been neutralized by HCoV-229E. In contrast, the impact of IFN\u03b1-induced BST2 on virus egress was significant in samples analyzed 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1D).",

            "text": "While BST2 significantly blocks HCoV-229E progeny virus release, it does not completely block HCoV-229E replication. BST2 is one component of innate immune response in the form of restricting enveloped virion release (Sauter et al., 2010). However, many viruses have evolved specific antagonists to counteract BST2 anti-viral activity\u2014examples include HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-2 Env, simian immunodeficiency virus, Nef and Env, Ebola and Sendai virus GP, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K5 (Gupta et al., 2009, Jia et al., 2009, Kaletsky et al., 2009, Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009, Mansouri et al., 2009, Neil et al., 2008, Pardieu et al., 2010, Bampi et al., 2013). Our finding that HCoV-229E infection leads to markedly reduced BST2 expression levels similar to those observed in HIV-1 infections suggests that some HCoV-229E factors are capable of triggering BST2 downregulation. In the case of SARS-CoV, IFN expression is suppressed following infection (Narayanan et al., 2008); this may promote virus spreading due to its inability to trigger BST2 expression. However, SARS is considered a systemic disease involving many organs (Holmes, 2003) that constitutively express BST2 (Erikson et al., 2011). It remains to be determined whether SARS-CoV virion release is also restricted by BST2, and whether coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV) have evolved strategies to oppose BST2 anti-viral activity.",
