            "text": "In December 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1]. The virus is highly transmissible, but the source and route of transmission have yet to be determined [2]. Clinical nurses experienced great stress when they were fighting against COVID-19 with needs for health, safety, interpersonal relationships, and related knowledge. Alderfer [3] proposed the existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) theory of humanistic needs on the basis of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. He believed that people have three core needs, namely a need for survival, a need for relationships, and a need for growth and development. The purpose of this study is to use in-depth interviews to understand the psychological needs of front-line nurses working in extraordinary epidemic situations, and to analyze the main content of their psychological needs from the lens of the ERG theory and to provide a perspective for interventions to alleviate the psychological stress of nurses at the front-line.",

A total of 10 nurses were interviewed; the sample size was based on the saturation of information [4]. Among the interviewed nurses, nine were female and one was male, aged 25\u201338 (29.9 \u00b1 3.62) years. Three of them had 5-year or less of nursing experience, five had 5\u201310 years of nursing experience, and two had 10 or more years of nursing experience. Three of them had a junior college diploma, six with a bachelor\u2019s degree and one with a master\u2019s degree. Seven of them had experience in critical care nursing. Before they began to care for COVID-19 patients, they worked in the neurology department, the emergency department, the cardiac surgery department, the hematology department, and the infectious diseases department, respectively.",

The outline of the interview was as follows: (1) Please tell us your feelings about caring for COVID-19 patients over the past few days. (2) What are your biggest needs or expectations right now? (3) How has taking care of COVID-19 patients affected your personal life? (4) Do you have any lived experiences and feelings about this job differ from before? Interviews were conducted by researchers who had been trained in qualitative research interviewing techniques. Before the interview, the interviewees were told about the purpose, content, and significance of the study in order to earn their trust and cooperation. Interviews were conducted in a quiet and well-ventilated room, which would be disinfected after completing an interview. Both the interviewer and interviewee wore protective masks with a distance of at least 1 meter from each other, and the duration of the interview time was kept within 30 min as much as possible. A voice recorder was used to record during interviews with the consent of the interviewees. In addition, non-verbal cues by the interviewee, such as eye movements and gestures, were noticed and recorded. The interviewees were coded as N1\u2013N10 and their privacy was protected in accordance with the principles of confidentiality [5]. This study was approved by the hospital ethics committee.",

The relatedness need is primarily manifested as a need for interpersonal relationships, a need for community concern, and a need for affection. During the period of lockdown in Wuhan, the need for interpersonal relationships specially reflected the desire of clinical nurses to communicate face-to-face with family members, colleagues, and friends. The need for community concern manifests as nurses\u2019 need for care, help, and support from department heads, the hospital, and the outside world. The need for affection reflected their desire for family affection is stronger than usual. The growth need is manifested as a strong need for knowledge about COVID-19 prevention and control, especially from authoritative reports. Specific categories and narrative examples are shown in Table 1\n.",
