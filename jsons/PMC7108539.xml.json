            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a disease of human and non-human primates, caused by five genetically distinct members of the Ebolavirus genus, Filoviridae family. So far Zaire, Sudan and Bundibugyo viruses have been responsible for most of the human EVD outbreaks (Feldmann and Geisbert 2011). Ebola virus (EBOV) infects a broad range of cell types (Feldmann and Geisbert 2011). Binding and entry into target cells are mediated by the viral glycoprotein GP, a class I fusion protein composed of a receptor binding subunit (GP1) and a fusion subunit (GP2) (Lee et al.2008; Lee and Saphire 2009. After initial internalization via macropinocytosis, virus particle trafficking into the endolysosomal pathway ends up into late endosomes, where the low-pH-dependent cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L allow processing of the GP1 into a 19 kDa fusogenic form (Chandran et al.2005; Schornberg et al.2006; Dube et al.2009; Hood et al.2010; Miller et al.2012). Subsequently, the interaction between the processed GP1 and the late endosomal/lysosomal protein Neimann\u2013Pick C1 (NPC-1) leads to GP2-dependent fusion of the viral envelope with the limiting membrane of the endosomes (Carette et al.2011; Cote et al.2011; Miller et al.2012). NPC-1 protein is necessary for virus infectivity, as cells from patients with Neimann\u2013Pick disease, due to lack or malfunction of the NPC-1 protein, are resistant to EBOV infection (Carette et al.2011). In addition to the NPC-1, it has been recently demonstrated that EBOV entry into the target cells requires also the presence of the endosomal/lysosomal calcium channels called two-pore channels (Sakurai et al.2015).",

            "text": "It has been recently reported that amiodarone inhibits filovirus replication in vitro, while the mechanism of inhibition remains unclear (Gehring et al.2014). In patients with arrhythmia chronically treated with 200\u2013600 mg day\u22121 amiodarone, drug plasma concentration ranges from 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 to 5.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, while after intravenous administration, plasma levels can increased up to 11 \u03bcM (Ha et al.2005; Breitenstein et al.2008). We have previously reported that 16 h of incubation with 10 \u03bcM amiodarone induces a full-fledged NPC-like phenotype (Piccoli et al.2011). In order to confirm the anti-ebolavirus activity of amiodarone and to analyse whether the NPC-like phenotype plays a role at this level, Vero cells were incubated for 16 h with 2, 5 or 10 \u03bcM amiodarone which previously displayed no appreciable cytotoxicity (Piccoli et al.2011). Cells were then infected with recombinant VSV encoding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in place of the glycoprotein G (VSV\u0394G-GFP), pseudotyped with either the envelope glycoprotein G of the VSV (VSV-recombinant virus) or the ZEBOV-envelope glycoprotein (GP-pseudotyped virus). A MOI of 0.1 FFU/cell was employed to achieve a percentage of infected cells which allows, with all the recombinant viruses tested, the evaluation of the antiviral effect without saturating the system. Two hours post-infection, cells were rinsed and incubated for additional 24 h in the presence of the appropriate drug concentration before evaluating GFP-positive cells by cytofluorimetry. The 2 h time frame was selected in order to ensure the adhesion to the target cells of all the used recombinant viruses, in the adopted experimental settings. Our results show that amiodarone inhibited GP-pseudotyped virus in a dose-dependent manner with an estimated IC50 (half maximal dose inhibitory concentration) of 5.6 \u03bcM (Fig. 2a). By contrast, the drug did not display such an effect on VSV-recombinant virus.",

            "text": "To clarify the structural basis of amiodarone ability to interfere with EBOV infection, we analysed the effect of amiodarone analogues (Fig. 1) on GP-pseudotyped virus infection. Analogues have already been tested for their toxicity and ability of inducing an NPC-like phenotype (Quaglino et al.2004; Bigler et al.2007; Piccoli et al.2011). Vero cells were treated for 16 h with amiodarone or its analogues (at concentrations of clinical relevance, when applicable, or at the ones sufficient to induce an NPC-like phenotype without being toxic to cells) and then incubated for 2 h with GP-pseudotyped virus (MOI of 0.1 FFU/cell). Infected cells were maintained in medium containing the appropriate compound for additional 24 h, and GFP-positive cells were evaluated by cytofluorimetry. As shown in Fig. 7, the diethylamino-\u03b2-ethoxy lateral group, which is a determinant for accumulation into acidic organelles, is required for antiviral activity. Furthermore, it appears that, among the compounds bearing this group, the antiviral activity correlates with the ability of inducing an NPC-like phenotype (MeAmi > Amiodarone > PIPAM > MDEA) (Piccoli et al.2011). In addition, a bulky benzofuran hydrophobic moiety is necessary for the antiviral activity, as D2, which has the diethylamino-\u03b2-ethoxy group but lacks a hydrophobic moiety, is inactive. Of note, the amiodarone metabolite didesethyl amiodarone (DDEA), usually found in traces in serum, is devoid of antiviral activity.",

            "text": "Recently, Gehring et al. (2014) demonstrated that amiodarone and dronedarone, drugs approved for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, inhibit filovirus infection. The aim of the present work was to further characterize the effect of amiodarone on EBOV infection. Interestingly, we found that amiodarone inhibits EBOV infection in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrations comparable to plasma levels found in intravenously treated patients. The IC50 of amiodarone calculated by employing a recombinant GP-pseudotyped VSV on Vero cells was 5.6 \u03bcM. It has to be mentioned that a recent study (Gehring et al.2014) reported an IC50 of amiodarone around 2.2 \u03bcM, with a GP-pseudotyped lentivirus, and around 0.4 \u03bcM with the ZEBOV. Taking into account the different viral/cellular systems employed, overall these data indicate that amiodarone efficiently inhibits EBOV infection. The antiviral potency varies with the timing of cell exposure to the drug. Inhibition is maximum when amiodarone pretreatment induces an NPC-like phenotype, but a partial inhibition is also appreciable when amiodarone is added during very early steps of infection, suggesting that the anti-EBOV properties might derive on one side from cell structural modifications associated with amiodarone accumulation, and on the other side from a direct effect of the drug on specific steps of the viral life cycle. In this respect, amiodarone could act by modifying lipid fluidity (Chatelain, Laruel and Gillard 1985), by increasing membrane-proximal pH (Mitterreiter et al.2010), by competing for negatively charged groups on the surface or by affecting calcium channels, required for the maturation of the endosomes and/or viral entry (Kolter and Sandhoff 2010; Gehring et al.2014). Interestingly, we found that amiodarone affects viral fusion, as it has been previously reported for the U18666A inhibitor (Carette et al.2011). After viral internalization, GP cleavage proceeds through a 50 and a 20 kDa intermediate, ultimately generating the key 19 kDa core protein (Chandran et al.2005; Schornberg et al.2006; Dube et al.2009; Hood et al.2010; Miller et al.2012). Interestingly, the artificial activation of GP by thermolysin treatment of viral particles before infection rescued the effect of amiodarone. It has been demonstrated that amiodarone can affect the stability of specific proteins, such as SP-A (Baritussio et al.2001). Here we demonstrated that the cellular content of cathepsin B and L, required for the formation of the fusogenic form of GP, was not affected by drug treatment. However, we cannot exclude that amiodarone might influence the activity of these proteases, as it has been demonstrated for different proteolytic enzymes (Mitterreiter et al.2010; Piccoli et al.2011). Furthermore, specific effects on steps subsequent to the EBOV entry/fusion, as demonstrated in the case of the SARS coronavirus and HCV (Stadler et al.2008; Cheng et al.2013), cannot be ruled out.",

Moreover, a hydrophobic moiety is also critical, perhaps regulating the interactions with membranes. Overall, these observations support the idea that the antiviral activity of amiodarone relies on its ability to interact with membranes, to accumulate into the acidic organelles (Logan et al.2014) and to induce an NPC-like phenotype (Piccoli et al.2011; Shoemaker et al.2013; Gehring et al.2014).",
