            "text": "The Poxviridae comprise a family of large, complex viruses with 130 to > 300 kbp double-stranded DNA genomes that infect numerous vertebrate and invertebrate animals (Moss, 2007). Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as the vaccine for smallpox eradication and is currently employed as a live recombinant vector for expression studies and development of vaccines against other pathogens and cancer (Moss, 1996). VACV, by far the most intensively studied poxvirus, replicates entirely in the cytoplasm of infected cells and encodes many of the proteins required for its growth as well as numerous proteins modulating virus\u2013host interactions. The genome of VACV comprises a subset of genes that are common to all or most poxviruses and essential for replication in cell culture and another subset of genes that are specific for the orthopoxvirus genus, mostly nonessential in cell culture and involved in host interactions (Upton et al., 2003). Those genes that are conserved throughout the Poxviridae have been functionally characterized to varying degree of detail. However, many genes that are present in most but not all chordopoxviruses remain to be analyzed. One example is the uncharacterized VACV F16L gene, which has been retained in all chordopoxviruses except for avipoxviruses. Our interest in this gene, apart from its considerable evolutionary conservation, was stimulated by evidence that the F16 protein ortholog of Nile crocodile poxvirus (CRV) is homologous to site-specific serine recombinases of prokaryotic transposons and bacteriophages (Afonso et al., 2006). Here we provide a detailed computational analysis of the F16 protein indicating that it is unlikely to have serine recombinase activity, and experimental data showing that the F16L gene is not required for virus growth in cell culture. Remarkably, the F16 protein specifically localized to the nucleoli of infected and uninfected cells.",

            "text": "Our specific interest in the F16 protein of VACV was aroused by the report of Afonso and co-workers (Afonso et al., 2006) that the putative protein encoded by the 051 gene of CRV shares similarity with both bacterial transposon resolvases and homologs of VACV F16, which were detected in all chordopoxviruses except avipoxviruses. Starting with the VACV F16 sequence, an iterative database search using the PSI-BLAST program (Altschul et al., 1997) revealed a distant relationship to CRV051 and the lack of any detectable homolog in avipoxviruses. Whereas the CRV protein showed statistically highly significant similarity to numerous proteins of the Ser recombinase superfamily from bacterial and archaeal transposons and bacteriophages (Grindley et al., 2006, Olorunniji and Stark, 2010, Smith and Thorpe, 2002), the VACV F16 and the other poxvirus orthologs showed only marginally significant similarity (expect value of ~ 0.03 (Altschul et al., 1997)). Excluding CRV, the detection of homology of the F16 proteins with Ser recombinases required at least two PSI-BLAST iterations, accounting for the absence of such annotation in the literature. Nevertheless, the validity of this relationship was strongly supported by additional search results using the HHSearch method (Soding, 2005) that detects Ser recombinases as proteins with the greatest similarity to a Hidden Markov Model generated from the alignment of poxvirus F16 proteins with a 97% confidence.",

            "text": "The region of sequence conservation between F16 proteins and Ser recombinases encompasses the entire catalytic domain of the latter that consists of approximately 140 amino acids (Fig. 1\n). All structural elements of the resolvase/recombinase domain appear to be conserved in F16 as indicated by the comparison of the predicted secondary structure of F16 and the crystal structure of resolvases of the Ser recombinase superfamily (Fig. 1). Strikingly, however, most of the individual conserved amino acid residues of the resolvases/recombinases have matches only in the CRV protein but not in the other poxvirus F16 sequences. Specifically, all 8 amino acid residues that comprise the catalytic site of the Ser recombinases, namely Tyr6, Arg8, Ser10, Gln14, Gln19, Asp36, Arg68, and Arg71 (using the amino acid numbering of Tn3 resolvase which is nearly identical to Res_1GDT included in the alignment in Fig. 1) are conserved in the CRV protein (with the substitution of Glu for Asp36 that is found in many Ser recombinases), whereas only two, Ser10 and Gln19, are represented in the rest of the F16 proteins (Fig. 1). Although Ser10 is the main catalytic residue of Ser recombinases that is directly responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA, the other residues in the catalytic site, in particular the three conserved Arg, are also essential for catalysis (Olorunniji and Stark, 2009, Olorunniji and Stark, 2010). Given the concerted loss of 6 of the 8 catalytic residues, and in particular the three essential Arg residues, it can be confidently predicted that F16 proteins are inactivated derivatives of Ser recombinases that possess no enzymatic activity. Thus, whatever the function of these proteins in poxvirus reproduction might be, it does not involve site-specific recombination. Most of the Ser recombinases contain a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domain to the C-terminus (or less commonly to the N-terminus) of the catalytic domain. The approximately 100 amino acid region following the recombinase homology domain of F16 does not show detectable similarity to any helix-turn-helix domains, although it is predicted to adopt a primarily alpha-helical fold (not shown). This unique domain might mediate functionally important protein-DNA and/or protein interactions.",

Yet the likelihood that the protein lacks Ser recombinase activity left us with no clue as to what that function might be. Our first question was whether F16 was essential for VACV replication. We succeeded in knocking out the F16L gene by replacing it with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene under the control of the synthetic early/late VACV promoter (Chakrabarti et al., 1997). Green fluorescent plaques formed and the knockout virus v\u0394F16 was plaque purified, suggesting that the function of F16 is non-essential at least in BS-C-1 cells used for its isolation. Plaques produced by v\u0394F16 were compared with wild type (wt) virus on several conventionally used cell lines (BS-C-1, RK13, HeLa, and A543) as well as on two primary cell cultures, chick embryo fibroblasts and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). No difference was detected in the plaque size or appearance of the mutant and the wt virus on any of the tested cells (Fig. 2\nand data not shown). Furthermore, no differences in the yields of v\u0394F16 and wt virus were found in a single round of infection of BS-C-1, HeLa, and RK13 cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown).",

F16, however, was expressed starting early in infection, before viral DNA synthesis and factory formation. Unexpectedly, in non-confluent cells before 8 h of infection F16 was detected in the nuclei, where it was concentrated in the nucleoli and to some extent on the nuclear membrane in addition to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A). F16 was detected in virus factory regions, presumably accounting for its incorporation into virions, but was not concentrated there (Figs. 6A and C). Localization in the nucleoli also occurred when cells were infected in the presence of the DNA replication inhibitor araC (Fig. 6B). In confluent cells and at later times after infection, F16 was distributed throughout the cell but there was still some nucleoplasmic staining (Fig. 6C and data not shown). A similar inverse correlation between localization in nucleoli and density of cell monolayer has been observed for the nucleoprotein NP of influenza virus (Bui et al., 2002).",

Two other VAC proteins, I3 and B1, containing a C-terminal 3xflag tag and expressed from a transfected plasmid under the control of the CMV promoter were analyzed in parallel with F16-3xflag, and no nucleolar or nuclear membrane staining was detected (not shown). The association of F16 with nucleoli was confirmed by colocalization with nucleolin/C23 (Fig. 6D) and nucleophosmin/B23 (Fig. 6E). Different anti-flag antibodies were used in the latter double-staining experiments, namely an anti-flag mouse monoclonal antibody with an anti-nucleolin rabbit polyclonal antibody and a rabbit polyclonal anti-flag with mouse monoclonal anti-nucleophosmin antibody. Thus, two independent anti-flag antibodies detected the same staining pattern for F16, corroborating the specificity. As in infected cells, the localization of F16 depended to a great extent on the level of expression in an individual cell. In transfected cells with high F16 expression level, either the entire cell or only the cytoplasm was stained with flag antibody (Figs. 6F and G). The same pattern of F16 accumulation was detected in HeLa cells, BS-C-1 and RK13 cells infected with vF16-3xflag or transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing F16-3xflag from the CMV promoter (not shown).",

Similarly, Ser8 is conserved in all poxvirus F16 orthologs except for CRV. To assess the potential importance of Ser11 and Ser8 for the targeting of F16 to the nucleoli, two mutants were constructed in which Ser11 or Ser8 was replaced by Ala.

In order to determine which part of the protein might be responsible for targeting to nuclei and nucleoli, we investigated the localization of a truncated mutant of F16 as well as the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of F16 expressed separately. In the truncated mutant of F16 (T), the 21 C-terminal amino acids were removed (Fig. 7A). This region includes a predicted alpha-helix that is conserved in the chordopoxvirus F16 homologs (not shown) and potentially could be involved in protein\u2013protein interactions. The T mutant was still targeted to the nucleoli, but showed much less cytoplasmic staining than the full-length protein (Fig. 7B). In addition, when highly expressed, the T mutant exhibited a characteristic halo that lined the inner side of the nuclear membrane (Fig. 7B). The N-terminal domain, which is homologous to Ser recombinases, and the unique C-terminal domain of F16 were not targeted to the nucleoli under any conditions. The N-terminal domain was distributed throughout the cell but was specifically excluded from the nucleoli, whereas the C-terminal domain was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that for the nucleolar targeting of F16 interaction between structural elements located in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains might be required.",

Thus, the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario involves acquisition of a Ser recombinase gene by the ancestor of chordopoxviruses from a transposon or a bacteriophage. This scenario is reminiscent of other probable bacterial or bacteriophage contributions to the evolution of poxviruses, in particular, the Holiday junction resolvase A22 (Garcia et al., 2000) and the predicted deubiquitinase G6 (Senkevich et al., 2008) as well as the primase-helicase D5 and the DNA-packaging ATPase A32 that are shared with other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (Koonin and Yutin, 2010). The subsequent evolution of chordopoxviruses apparently involved the abrogation of the recombinase activity of F16, as evidenced by the substitution of key amino acids in the active site region. This loss of activity occurred after the divergence of CRV [the deepest chordopoxvirus branch (Afonso et al., 2006, Koonin and Yutin, 2010)] from the common ancestor with the other chordopoxviruses but prior to the radiation of the latter, and the complete loss of this gene in the avipoxvirus branch.

Given its conservation and early expression shown here, a role in viral DNA replication or recombination seemed one possibility. However, knockout of the F16L gene had no measurable effect on virus growth in any of the many tested cell cultures including resting primary HFFs. Another gene with similar biological features is the G6R gene that is conserved in all poxviruses and encodes a putative deubiquitinating enzyme (Senkevich et al., 2008). Knockout of the G6R gene has no effect on virus growth in all tested cell cultures and leads only to a slight attenuation in intranasal mouse infection. Conservation of these genes in most poxvirus genera suggests that their functions are not directly involved in the virus growth cycle but may be involved in generic aspects of virus-host interaction as opposed to interactions between viruses and their specific hosts.",

A likely possibility is that F16 targets the nucleus and nucleoli by interacting with a cellular protein. Thus far, we have been unable to detect an interaction of F16 with cellular nucleolin or nucleophosmin by coimmunopurification (TGS, unpublished) but interactions with other cellular proteins remain a possibility. We did find that F16 interacts with itself to form homodimers or higher order multimers. If there is competition between F16 binding to itself and to a cell protein, this could explain the inverse correlation of nucleolar targeting with the level of expression and confluency of cells. Conditions in which the concentration of F16 is increased (high expression) or the cell protein is decreased (confluency), might favor multimer formation and cytoplasmic localization.",

            "text": "Targeting of viral proteins to nucleoli is a frequent theme in the study of virus\u2013host interactions. For example, a genome-wide screen of three distinct herpesviruses has shown that at least 12 herpesvirus-encoded proteins specifically localize to the nucleolus (Salsman et al., 2008). Targeting of viral proteins to nucleoli has been described not only for DNA viruses such as herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and papovaviruses, and RNA viruses, such as retroviruses and influenza, that possess a defined nuclear stage of reproduction, but also for proteins of RNA viruses without any nuclear stage such as coronaviruses, arteriviruses and filoviruses as well as several groups of RNA viruses of plants (Hiscox, 2007, Hiscox et al., 2010, Taliansky et al., 2010). Concomitantly, it has become evident than nucleoli are not only the factories of ribosome biosynthesis, as previously thought, but multifunctional and dynamic structures that contain hundreds of cellular proteins and are involved in a variety of signaling pathways, including cell cycle control, regulation of cell division, apoptosis, antiviral defense, cancer, and more (Boisvert et al., 2007, Sirri et al., 2008). For many viruses, trafficking of viral proteins through nucleoli is an important step in their growth cycle, and accordingly, the viral proteins directed to nucleolus are essential for the viral replication in cell culture. For example, herpesvirus and human immunodeficiency virus proteins that are targeted to the nucleolus have been implicated in viral mRNA processing (Hiscox et al., 2010). Several proteins of adenoviruses and herpesviruses cause redistribution of nucleolar components, reorganization of the nucleolus and interference with nucleolar function, including disruption of rRNA synthesis, processing and trafficking (Hiscox et al., 2010).",

Host transcription is impaired by mechanisms that have not been well characterized (Puckett and Moss, 1983). Jefferts and Holowczak (Jefferts and Holowczak, 1971) reported decreased nucleolar RNA synthesis in VACV-infected L cells and detected peptide from 14C-labeled virions in nucleoli. In our studies, the F16 protein was specifically targeted to the nucleoli of transfected HeLa cells but it had no obvious effect on rRNA synthesis as determined by EU incorporation and click chemistry. In a preliminary experiment, we did not see greater EU labeling of HeLa cell nucleoli in cells infected with the F16 deletion mutant compared to wt virus (TGS, unpublished). Thus, F16 may affect another, perhaps signaling functions of the nucleoli. Further studies of this phenomenon could reveal an additional layer of manipulation of host cell functions by poxviruses.",

The viral protein selection consists of one representative of 9 of the 10 Chordopoxvirus genera that encode this protein (with the exception of avipoxviruses). The Ser recombinase selection consists of four sequences of putative resolvases and recombinases with the greatest similarity to F16 and three sequences for representative crystal structures. The secondary structure lines show the structural elements for F16 proteins that were predicted using the PSIPRED program (Buchan et al., 2010) and the structural elements extracted from the 1GDT structure; E indicates extended conformation (beta-strand) and H indicates alpha-helix. Asterisks above and beneath the alignment indicate invariant amino acid residues in the F16 sequences and in the selected Ser recombinase sequences, respectively. The catalytic residues of Ser recombinases and the matching residues in the poxvirus sequences are shaded gray. The catalytic serine is shown by white type on black background. The alignment was constructed using the MOFFT program (Katoh et al., 2005) and slightly manually adjusted to improve the alignment of secondary structure elements. The poxvirus sequences are denoted by an abbreviated virus name followed by the gene name; the Ser recombinase sequences are denoted by the abbreviated species name followed by abbreviated protein annotation; for the sequences with resolved crystal structures, the PDB Accession Numbers are indicated.
