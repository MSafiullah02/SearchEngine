            "text": "1. At present, there is a high and global receptivity to variola virus. After eradication and more than 30 years no vaccination was performed and average protection postvaccination is about 5-7 years. A stock of 200 million doses of prepared vaccine was saved for use in case of accidental outbreak. In the last 5 years many countries prepared necessary stockpile of vaccine against smallpox. But WHO does not recommend vaccination of individuals before the smallpox epidemic occurs because of side effects. Vaccinia immune globulin recommended for the treatment of serious side effects is in very limited quantity so that stockpiles of this globulin were suggested to be made 2. Contagiousness of smallpox is higher than 80%. The first generation of cases would rapidly spread in highly susceptible population, expanding each generation of cases, by a factor of 10 times or more during winter or spring [9] . As was recently demonstrated by pandemic spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), this rapid extension of smallpox could be a global disaster. Long-distance traveling of undetected human sources could represent the major way of pandemic spreading of smallpox also. 3. Clinical picture of smallpox has always had strong psychological impact in \"civilian population\", so this impact is expected to happen. Because of lack of immunoprotection a high proportion of severe clinical pictures involving long hospitalization is estimated. Unpredictable medical difficulties will be arised by the incapacity of medical authorities to cover these huge requirements. Mild cases will be homeisolated increasing epidemic risk and spreading [14, 15] . 196 M. NEGUT laboratories in the world were required to destroy their remaining variola virus stocks. In 1996, WHO General Assembly decided to destroy the virus stocks exist officially [16] . Immense stockpiles of variola virus along with smallpox vaccine [6] .",

The illness is expected to be very severe in the majority of cases as the population under 40 years has no variola, \"immunologic specific memory\" (the vaccination was stopped in many countries before 1977). There is no etiologic treatment in smallpox. So the hospitalization will be of long duration overcoming hospital capacities in an epidemic situation. Severe malignant and hemorrhagic forms are fatal always so mortality is overcoming 30% in smallpox. Immunodeficient patients, pregnancy, and chronic cardiac diseases are predisposing conditions to severe forms. Clinical recognition of the illness is difficult in the first stage in the absence of epidemic information/suspicion. First cases will have high epidemic potential. Laboratory confirmation is also late in the first cases because routine laboratory investigation does not include such a potential etiology. Figure 2 shows the risk during the progression of disease. Starting from the 10th day after contamination, the patient represents an important source of infection by respiratory droplets and later by the content of vesicles and pustules and at the end by scabs. The hospitalization in smallpox is compulsory in all the period of contagiousness that means minimum 3-4 weeks. In epidemic situation hospital capacities are overcome.",
