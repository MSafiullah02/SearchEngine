            "text": "Acute BRD (ABRD) is a respiratory syndrome linked to presence of infectious agents, but also to management, environment, stress and immunity factors (Callan and Garry, 2002). A wide range of pathogens, essentially viruses and bacteria, can cause ABRD, separately or simultaneously (Autio et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the main agents involved are viruses (Caldow et al., 1993), the most frequent being bovine herpesvirus 1 (the agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis) (Hage et al., 1998), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) (Elvander, 1996), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) (Van Reeth and Adair, 1997), and parainfluenza-3 virus (PIV-3) (Hartel et al., 2004). Some other viruses have been identified during BRD outbreaks, such as bovine coronavirus (BCV) and adenovirus (BAV) (Hartel et al., 2004, Storz et al., 1996), and even influenza A virus (Brown et al., 1998, Graham et al., 2002, Jones-Lang et al., 1998). Most of these pathogens are ubiquitous and ABRD is enzootic with outbreaks occurring regularly, especially during the autumn\u2013winter season (Jones-Lang et al., 1998, van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2001). In addition to a seasonal pattern, ABRD has a strong spatial heterogeneity and dynamic (Elvander, 1996) caused by epidemics clustered in space and time (Norstrom et al., 1999).",

At the herd level, the main risk factors concern type of production, herd size, housing characteristics (housing system, ventilation, animal density) and management practices (animal movement, hygiene, BRD vaccination) (van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2000). Main animal characteristics associated with ABRD occurrence concern age, body condition and immune status (Callan and Garry, 2002). The noticeable health and economic consequences and the high variability in space and time of ABRD would require a nation-wide surveillance of the syndrome in order to improve its control.

The purpose of the survey was to provide representative information at a national level of indicators of farm management. The retrospective cohort was made up by a stratified random sampling with unequal probabilities among the 282,553 cattle herds in France (bovine population census in 2000). The stratification was based on the administrative region (department), type of production and herd size. Twenty-one strata in each department were created (Fig. 1\n), in which a random sample of farms was selected using a random numbers generator. An extrapolation coefficient (EC) was calculated to ensure sample representativeness, i.e. EC = population size in the stratum/sample size in the stratum. The sample size in each stratum depended on the number of farms and on the heterogeneity of the farms in the stratum: the higher the heterogeneity of location, breed and housing type, the higher the sample size was, and the lower the EC of each sampled farm was. Hence a region with many farms of the same type close to each other was represented by only a small amount of farms as each one was very representative of the others, in terms of farm characteristics but also inter-farms contagious diseases. Seventy-three out of the 96 French departments were areas of bovine production with a total of 271,963 farms from which 17,462 farms were selected for the sample.",

In order to study the spatial and temporal dynamic of ABRD, we then performed a space\u2013time cluster analysis, using the retrospective space\u2013time scan statistic for point data (Kulldorff et al., 1998). This method tests whether the spatial and temporal locations of all cases were independent of each other by performing a comparison of the risk of being a case within a moving cylinder (the base of the cylinder representing space and the height representing time) to the risk of being a case outside the cylinder, and estimates the relative risk. The most likely cluster is the cylinder with the maximum likelihood of representing the observed data. Secondary clusters can also be detected, the criteria being no overlap with the most likely cluster. ABRD-affected farms were defined as cases with the corresponding date of occurrence (if a farm was affected more than once, it appeared several time in the case file). Non-affected herds were defined as controls, and were given a random date within the time span of the study period. We used the Bernoulli model to detect clusters with high rates, using month as time precision, and 999 Monte Carlo replications. Several parameters were tested for maximum spatial cluster size (20%, 30% 40% and 50% of the total population) and maximum temporal cluster size (30%, 40% and 50% of the study period).",

The weighting process was performed by modification of model dependent estimators (Pfeffermann, 1993). The explanatory variables examined were production type, herd size, and the practice of vaccination against ABRD. The department was added as a random effect to account for geographic variations. The production type was a qualitative variable whose categories were defined as dairy, beef, calf rearing, steer/young bull rearing, and other forms of production, according to the dominant animal category of the farm. Dummy variables were created, with beef production as the reference group. The herd size was the total number of animals in the herd on the date of the survey. We used successively both continuous and categorical variables for herd size and evaluated log-linearity. The practice of vaccination against BRD was a binary variable. We first performed a univariable analysis with a risk alpha = 30% to select the explanatory variables to be included in the multivariable analysis. We then used the stepwise procedure of Hosmer and Lemeshow during the multivariable analysis to obtain the final model. We also tested two by two interactions terms and kept only the significant ones in the final model.",

The herd-level incidence of ABRD was 35% in the study of Norstrom et al. (2000), but in Norway no specific ABRD virus occurs endemically, consequently the susceptible population is larger than in France where ABRD outbreaks occur annually. According to our study, ABRD was clustered in space and time, with clusters corresponding to the areas with the highest ABRD cumulative incidence at farm level. These clusters were not explained by the risk factors herd size or type of production as these risk factors varied in space but had no space\u2013time interaction. ABRD clustering suggested a common infectious agent in the epidemic of those specific regions, but since no serological tests were performed, it was not possible to determine which agents were involved. As ABRD is multifactorial and its causative agents ubiquitous, no specific reporting or control measure is required in France when a farm is affected. Consequently the infection can easily spread to the surroundings farms. ABRD mainly occurred during the colder months, suggesting the influence of conditions like low temperatures, high humidity, and high population densities (Callan and Garry, 2002).",

Dairy herds presented a higher risk than beef herds, this outcome being consistent with previously published results (Norstrom et al., 2000). Steer/young bull rearing and calf-rearing farms were less affected than beef herds, but as these types of production were usually considered separately in other studies, the between-studies comparison was not easy. The influence of production type could be explained by different management practices, and especially by the housing system, as beef cattle are more frequently raised in open-range conditions, with a lower burden of respiratory pathogens and airborne contaminants such as dust particles, ammonia and endotoxins (Callan and Garry, 2002). Herd size was also involved in ABRD occurrence, larger herds having a higher risk, in accordance with previously published results (Norstrom et al., 2000, van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2000). This effect could be due to more numerous animal-to-animal contacts, increase in inter-farm human traffic, and potential higher animal densities, all these characteristics being important risk factors for the infection (Callan and Garry, 2002). BRD vaccination was associated with syndrome occurrence, and farms with a higher use of vaccination were more affected. But this relation should probably be explained in a converse way, i.e. the farmers having experienced an outbreak of ABRD were more prone to practice BRD vaccination. As we did not collect the date of vaccination with our survey, this hypothesis could not be demonstrated.",

Moreover, the cost of the performed survey was quite low as it used a pre-existing study scheme and only consisted in adding a very small number of questions to a farm questionnaire dealing with general herd characteristics. Nevertheless, the survey we performed should be conducted regularly for a dynamic and more accurate vision of disease trends, the present preliminary work aiming to build baseline data to evaluate annual risk of ABRD.
