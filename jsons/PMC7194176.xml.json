The initial chest X\u2010ray showed unilateral haziness or air space infiltrates in eight patients and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in two. All 10 cases showed evidence of infection by SARS coronavirus (Table 1). Seven of eight cases studied serologically showed a four\u2010fold or greater increase in serum titre for the antibody against SARS coronavirus. Eight of nine patients with clinical samples for analysis had a positive result with RT\u2010PCR for SARS coronavirus. Five of seven lung tissue samples were RT\u2010PCR positive.

For the open lung biopsy taken on day 9 (patient 1) and lung tissue from two patients who died shortly after the onset of symptoms (patients 2 and 8), the histology was represented mainly by acute (early exudative) phase DAD, with extensive hyaline membrane formation, a variable degree of alveolar haemorrhage and fibrin in alveolar spaces (Figure 1). The open lung biopsy also showed alveolar space and septal oedema. Coincidental background chronic bronchiolitis was present. Three specimens (patients 6, 9 and 10) taken at 11\u201321 days showed both acute and organizing (proliferative) phase DAD (Figure 2a). In addition to air space fibrin and hyaline membrane formation, there was septal widening by loose fibroblastic tissue and air space fibromyxoid tissue plugs. Moreover, all showed squamous metaplasia (Figure 2b) of the bronchial epithelium and alveolar lining. Three specimens (patients 4, 5 and 7) taken at 29\u201346 days were characterized by organizing DAD and fibrosis. In addition to interstitial and air space organization, dense septal and alveolar fibrosis became evident (Figure 3). Features of the acute phase of DAD were no longer seen except for a few remnant hyaline membranes. Features of different phases could be seen in different parts of the same sample. For patient 7, there was, in addition, bronchopneumonia, with abundant neutrophils admixed with fibrin in alveolar spaces (Figure 4).",
