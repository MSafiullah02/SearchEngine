Microvascular hypoxic or toxic damage to the endothelium initiates a cascade activation of cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, interleukin [IL]-1 and IL-6, platelet activation factor), which add to the local damage with hypoperfusion, stasis, and thrombosis. Shock is always a systemic reaction leading to multiple organ disease (i.e., multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). Various forms of acute and chronic inflammation develop, depending on the chronicity of the disturbance and the length of survival of the patient. Shock lung (compare ARDS and DAD) is characterized by diffuse, \u201ccloudy\u201d pulmonary infiltrate on radiography (a). Grossly, the lungs are pale (unless congested), voluminous, and of a \u201cjellylike\u201d consistency, with a humid cut surface (b). Microscopy shows a diffuse alveolar and interstitial edema with subsequent formation of hyaline membranes (c, d) and hyaline platelet aggregates (\u201cshock bodies\u201d) in capillaries and venules (e). As time progresses, interstitial inflammatory reactions occur with fibrosis (f)",

Its etiology includes chemical carcinogenesis (e.g., smoking, air pollution, occupational chemical exposure) and viral carcinogenesis (e.g., papillomavirus, adenovirus). For immediate clinical and therapeutic purposes, lung carcinoma is subdivided into small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Pathohistologically, one distinguishes SCC from adenocarcinoma, SCLC, large cell undifferentiated carcinoma (LCUC), and salivary gland-type tumors. Some have endocrine activities, and others are overt neuroendocrine tumors. These gross pictures show an example of SCC of the bronchus (a), with paratracheal and mediastinal lymph node metastases (b).
