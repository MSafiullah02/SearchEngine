            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is one of the deadliest pathogens faced by humankind being the etiological agent of a viral hemorrhagic fever named Ebola virus disease (EVD) affecting humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with high mortality rates. In less than 45 years, since its first discovery in 1976, EBOV claimed more than 11,000 deaths through several highly mortal outbreaks. In particular, across the years 2014 and 2016 a dreadful outbreak of EVD spread in West Africa, claiming more cases and deaths than all other previous epidemics combined.1 The ability of the infection to spread between countries, starting in Guinea and subsequently moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, and also exporting cases in extra-African countries, turned the spotlight on EVD as a global health emergency to be strongly counteracted. EBOV belongs to the viral order Mononegavirales that gathers together related viruses with a nonsegmented, linear, and single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome (ssRNA \u2212). Ebolavirus genera is one of the three genera along with Marburgvirus (MARV) and Cuevavirus, within the family Filoviridae and includes five distinct species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus, and the type species Zaire ebolavirus. The EBOV ssRNA(\u2212) genome is approximately 19 kb in size and encodes for seven proteins: the nucleoprotein NP, the polymerase cofactor VP35, the matrix proteins VP40 and VP24, the surface glycoprotein GP, the transcription activator VP30, and the large (L) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",

In the last 40 years, a number of antiviral compounds have shown some therapeutic promises in both in vitro and animal studies and some of these were administered to EVD patients, or to persons undergoing clinical trial evaluation, in particular during the 2014\u201316 West African epidemic. The unprecedented magnitude and scale of the West Africa outbreak, combined with the potential spread to other corners of the world, led to a recent renewed focus on medical interventions for EVD.10 However, despite the tremendous efforts spent in the discovery of therapeutics and in conducting some clinical trials during the biggest outbreak setting, no EBOV-specific therapy has been conclusively proven efficacious, nor has any therapy achieved regulatory approval for use in humans to date.10 A promising vaccine candidate, the rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIority Medicines status from the European Medicines Agency (Merck Press Release, July 25, 2016) and is currently awaiting a license.11 The vaccine showed 100% protection during a ring vaccination trial in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Conakry, and now it is still in use in the ongoing outbreak of Democratic Republic of Congo (May 2018).11\n",

CQ has been shown to act by multiple mechanisms. First, it was shown to directly perturb virus trafficking that results in aggregation of the viral particles, inhibiting their progression through the cytoplasm. Second, its antiviral activity appeared to be in part due to its inhibitory effects on the pH-dependent CatB and CatL, which have been shown to play a crucial role in EBOV GP1,2 processing events prior to fusion.21 However, more recent studies showed that CQ fails to protect against infection and disease in mice, hamsters, and guinea pig models as well as in patients.22, 23, 24\n",

In particular, benztropine, a drug clinically used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, effectively blocked replication of both infectious viruses (EC50\n = 3.7 and 13.2 \u03bcM, respectively), also suggesting a crucial role of GPCRs in filoviral entry mechanisms, and pointing out to the potential broad antiviral activity of GPCR antagonists.34 Interestingly, time-of-addition experiments and microscopic studies have provided evidence that GPCR antagonists block filoviral entry inhibiting a step following the initial attachment and prior to the viral/cell membrane fusion.34 It has been thus proposed either that filoviral GP can directly bind to one or multiple GPCRs and that such interaction could be critical for viral entry, or that EBOV can somehow trigger GPCR signaling, suggesting that GPCRs would be indirectly involved in filoviral entry.34\n",

This interaction triggers premature release of GP2 resulting in inhibition of viral fusion to the endosome membrane.36 Of note, crystal studies showed that the ibuprofen binding site is different to the one predicted by an in silico analysis37 suggesting the possible existence of two different binding sites for the compound on the EBOV GP.38 Recent results in cell culture assays (EC50\n = 100 \u03bcM) seem to confirm its potential as a molecular template for the further drug development in the search for an anti-EBOV treatment.38 Following the same thread, another library screening (of about 2600 compounds among FDA-approved drugs and common mechanistic probes) identified 30 compounds with anti-EBOV activity in both Vero E6 and human HepG2 cell lines, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (Fig. 3) (EC50\n = 3.1 and 1.4 \u03bcM, respectively) and paroxetine (EC50\n = 7.4 and 1.4 \u03bcM, respectively) and the calcium channel blocker bepridil (Fig. 3) (EC50\n = 5 and 3.2 \u03bcM, respectively).39 Sertraline and bepridil showed also a strong in vivo antiviral activity by affecting EBOV entry at a step after the internalization, inhibiting VLP-GP entry in a dose-dependent manner.39 More recently, crystallographic analysis and thermal shift assays demonstrated that sertraline, bepridil, paroxetine, and benztropine interact with the same toremifene EBOV GP pocket, thus affecting the thermal stability of the protein, destabilizing it and consequently leading to the block of virus/endosomal membrane fusion.40 However, it must be mentioned that high dosage of sertraline did not protect rhesus macaques in a subsequent challenge with a lethal EBOV dose (Makona strain), having no protective effect on viral load, morbidity, or survival.41\n",

NHPs treatment with 50 mg/kg cocktail MB-003, manufactured in the tobacco plant Nicotiana benthamiana, protected either 43%55 or 67%56 of animals challenged with EBOV, whereas controls with the same challenge stocks succumbed to infection.55, 56 Administration of 25 mg/kg murine mAb cocktail ZMab (mAbs: m1H3, m2G4, and m4G7) to NHPs 24 h after EBOV challenge showed 100% effectiveness (50% after 48 h), while 50 mg/kg ZMapp treatment showed 100% protection when administered 3 days postinfection.57 Furthermore, the coadministration of ZMab and an adenovirus-vectored IFN-\u03b1 (Ad-IFN) as investigated by Qiu et al. demonstrated high effectiveness in seven out of eight NHPs when the treatment was provided 3 days postinfection.58 In a further experimental design, NHPs were treated with both Ad-IFN 1 day postinfection after challenge and ZMAb at 4 days postinfection after challenge, with two out of four cynomologus macaques surviving with robust specific immune responses.58 ZMab was also tested on rhesus macaques in combination with IFN-\u03b2 showing to prolong the survival, but not impact on mortality.59 Thus, to extend the antibody half-life in humans and to facilitate the clinical acceptance, the ZMab cocktail was chimerized with human constant regions and produced in N. benthamiana, obtaining the Ab cocktail ZMapp (cocktail of three chimeric mAbs: c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7) that targets the GP base and glycan cap.60, 61 To solve the limitation of Abs manufacturing in N. benthamiana and its supplies in an outbreak context, the manufacturing of ZMapp in CHO cells was also attempted.62 However, recently, a third-generation anti-CD20 antibody, Obinutuzumab, was instead produced in N. benthamiana leaves with yield amounts comparable to the ones observed in CHO cells, opening a new perspective in this field.63 Finally, a more detailed structural analysis of ZMapp revealed a redundancy in mAbs c2G4 and c4G7 that recognize overlapping epitopes on the EBOV GP and compete with each other for binding. To solve this conflict, a chimeric MIL77E mAb cocktail was recently produced in engineered CHO cells on the basis of the mAbs c13C6 and c2G4 and showed to be fully protective in NHPs when administered at 50 mg/kg 3 days after challenge with a lethal dose of EBOV (variant Makona, responsible for the 2014\u201315 Western Africa outbreak).64\n",

Importantly, since GS-5734 has been found to distribute into the testes, epididymis, eyes, and brain, its use has been envisaged also in post-EVD patients (in which viral replication is still ongoing) and for eradication of persistent viral replication in the genital tract.77 For this reason, the drug was used in the case of a nurse who suffered an EBOV relapse causing meningoencephalitis and in an infant in Guinea, and both individuals survived infection.78 In addition, given that GS-5734 rapidly distributes to cells of the blood mononuclear lineage maintaining drug levels sufficient for viral inhibition for approximately 24 h, it may also be valuable for postexposure prophylaxis of high-risk exposures.77\n",

However, subsequent studies aimed at further investigating the anti-EBOV activity of lamivudine showed divergent results.81 To solve this contrast, the activity of lamivudine and another antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was thoroughly evaluated in diverse cell lines (including Vero E6, Huh-7, HeLa, Hep G2, and 293T cells) and primary monocyte-derived macrophages, with different time courses of drug treatment and assay endpoints, and using varying multiplicities of infections against two variants of wild-type EBOV (Kikwit and Makona). As a result of this investigation, both compounds showed to be ineffective against EBOV replication, never achieving greater than 30% viral inhibition.81 Collectively, the results of this study found no evidence to support the therapeutic use of lamivudine for the treatment of EVD.81\n",

In particular, nonphosphorylated VP30 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm where transcription is activated, while the phosphorylation of two N-terminal VP30 serines positively regulates its binding to NP-induced inclusions to form the nucleocapsid structure and negatively regulates the VP30 transcription activation function. Since the VP30 dephosphorylation is mediated by intracellular phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, and PP2C), treatment of EBOV-infected cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, led to an increase of VP30 phosphorylation, an accumulation of inactive VP30, a reduction in transcription activation, and a block of viral replication (EC50\n = 130 nM).100\n",

They play a crucial role in the methylation of 5\u2032-end guanine of viral mRNA, regulating the capping process. Adenosine analogs are potential SAH hydrolase inhibitors, blocking the cleavage of SAH into homocysteine and adenosine, which can be further metabolized into AMP, adenine, and inosine. SAH hydrolase inhibition leads to its accumulation into the cell, causing the inhibition of the SAM-dependent methylation processes including those necessary for the maturation (i.e., 5\u2032\u2032-capping) of viral mRNAs. As a consequence, the production of progeny virus particles is suppressed. When EBOV-infected mice were treated twice a day with C-c3Ado and c3-Npc A, a prolonged survival was observed. Treatment with C-c3Ado doses \u2265 0.7 mg/kg every 8 h on day 0 or 1 after challenge resulted in dose-dependent protection, with complete mortality prevention.101, 102, 103, 104 Interestingly, Bray et al. reported that the protective effect of c3-Npc A was due to massive increase of IFN-\u03b1 production in EBOV-infected, but not uninfected, mice.105 The c3-Npc A analog 1\u2033,6\u2033-isoneplanocin A enantiomers (d-like and l-like), also showed antiviral activity against several viruses, including EBOV in the submicromolar range (d-like EC50\n = 0.38 \u03bcM, l-like EC50\n = 0.76 \u03bcM).106 An in vitro screening utilizing a variant of EBOV-GFP resulted in the identification of the compound FGI-103, that inhibited EBOV infection in a dose-dependent manner (EC50\n = 100 nM), with > 90% EBOV inhibition with 0.8 \u03bcM of compound.107 A single intraperitoneal FGI-103 dose (10 mg/kg) delivered 24 h postinfection was sufficient to completely protect mice against a lethal EBOV challenge.107 The same dose of a FGI-103 derivative, FGI-104 (Fig. 4), delivered 2 h before infection resulted in a 100% of survival rate in the same EBOV mouse model.108 Moreover, a diazacrysene derivative, named FGI-106, and its analogs, FGI 106-a and FGI-106-b, also showed significant antiviral activity against EBOV.109, 110, 111 Interestingly, FGI-106 was able to reduce dose dependently the mortality rate in mice, leading a survival benefit of 100% with a dose of 5 mg/kg administered 1 h before infection.109 It has been demonstrated that FGI-106 inhibits replication of both ssRNA(\u2212) and ssRNA(+) viruses, suggesting it may affect a cellular pathway, however the molecular mechanism of action of these derivatives is not understood yet.109\n",

This allows glycoproteins to properly fold and interact with ER chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin, to be moved to the Golgi complexes for further processing.113 Abrogation of glycoprotein trafficking and processing by inhibition of ER \u03b1-glucosidases I and II results in the production of misfolded glycoproteins, which may be retained in the ER and ultimately driven to degradation.114 Although the viral envelope is rich in glycoproteins, mammalian viruses do not codify for their own glucosidases, thus host cell glucosidases represent validated antiviral targets for multiple enveloped viruses including EBOV. The antiviral effects of glucosidase inhibitors, such as the iminosugar compound deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and its derivatives, in which an oxygen has been substituted by a nitrogen atom that serves as competitive substrate and inhibit ER \u03b1-glucosidases I and II,115 have been observed for many types of viruses.116 Miglustat is a clinically approved glucosidase inhibitor used for treating lysosomal storage diseases (Gaucher's disease) that have also been evaluated in phase II trials for HIV infection showing limited efficacy due to its low potency and for the difficulties to achieve steady-state therapeutic concentrations.117, 118 Three Miglustat-derived iminosugars IHVR11029 (Fig. 5\n), IHVR17028, and IHVR19029 dose dependently blocked the assembly and secretion of EBOV envelope GP pseudotyped lentiviral particles in cell-based assays (EC50\n = 30 \u03bcM) and were active against lethal infections of EBOV in mice (50%\u201380% of survival rate).119\n",

MBL is a C-type lectin that recognizes hexose sugars including mannose, glucose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine on the surface of many pathogens, preferentially glycosylated viruses. It has been shown that recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) bind EBOV (Zaire) and MARV (Musoke) envelope GPs, mediating complement-dependent virus neutralization.121 In vitro studies showed that 100 ng/mL of rhMBL was the minimum concentration needed to inhibit > 90% infectivity of HepG2 cells using EBOV GP pseudotyped lentiviral particles and to inhibit > 90% EBOV infectivity in Vero E6 cells using recombinant EBOV-eGFP. Treatment of infected mice with a higher single intraperitoneal dose of 350 \u03bcg rhMBL either 1 h before or 12 h after EBOV challenge led to an increased survival \u2265 40% and allowed the development of an effective adaptive immune response (higher B lymphocyte and CD11b+ granulocyte counts and downregulation of intrahepatic cytokines that may mitigate the detrimental effects of the characteristic cytokine storm following the infection).10, 122\n",

It includes two basic patches with a high degree of sequence similarity among filoviruses: a first basic patch (FBP), important for replication complex formation through interactions with the viral NP, and central basic patch (CBP) important for VP35-dsRNA binding, IFN inhibition, and innate immune antagonism.128, 132 This latter feature led to term the IID also as RNA binding domain (RBD) and shows a unique fold that does not follow the \u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b2-\u03b2-\u03b1 organization observed for canonical RBDs. Previous studies revealed that mutation of key basic residues within the VP35 IID results in significant EBOV attenuation, diminished, or abolished suppression of IFN-\u03b2 induction, both in vitro and in vivo.132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137 Therefore, VP35 is a validated key target for drug development and a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention would be to target it to restore the innate immune functions.",

However, there is currently a lack in molecules that specifically counteract the VP24 function in suppressing the IFN signaling. Only a recent work provided the evidence that the binding between VP24 and KPNA may be druggable. Indeed, a macrocyclic peptide, eVpeD2 (Fig. 7\n), has been identified that blocks the VP24-KPNA5 interaction at low micromolar range in vitro (EC50\n = 9 \u03bcM).152 Moreover, the recent resolution of the structure of the VP24-KPNA5 complex (PDB-ID: 4U2X) allowed to perform a number of in silico studies to identify possible inhibitors.154, 155, 156 Docking studies showed a certain VP24 binding affinity to some plant polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, 1,2,3,6-tetragalloyl glucose (1,2,3,6-TGG) (Fig. 7), and theaflavin-3,3\u2032-digallate.157 Three small molecules extracted from Indian medicinal plants, limonin (Fig. 7), samarcandin and gummosin were reported to have high docked energy in complex with VP24.158 Moreover, a screening of 4500 compounds resulted in high docking score (\u2212 8.252) and glide energy (\u2212 34.633 kcal/mol) for the interaction between VP24 (PDB-ID: 4M0Q) and ST059622, also known as gossypetin, a flavonol compound isolated from Hibiscus sabdariffa and Alchemilla mollis, already known from their antiviral activity on other viruses including influenza virus A/WSN/33.159, 160, 161 In the same in silico screening, a strong interaction was identified between VP24 and ST060285 ortaxifolin, a flavonoid commonly present in different conifer species including Taxus chinensis and Larix sibirica, whose antiviral properties have been known for a long time.161, 162, 163 While gossypetin and taxifolin have been found to interact also with other protein targets, VP40, VP35, and VP30, the flavonoid ST101866 (Fig. 7) was specific for VP24.161 In another pharmacophore-based virtual screening and molecular docking study, deslanoside and digoxin with their respective analogs (ZINC85911633 and ZINC77291634) have been identified, among 56 FDA-approved drugs, to possess high binding affinity for VP24.91 Using a structural system pharmacology approach, Zhao et al. identified indinavir, a HIV protease inhibitor, as a possible ligand for VP24. Comparing the binding pattern of indinavir with its primary target, HIV protease (PDB-ID: 2AVO), it has been shown that the same indinavir atoms (O2, N4, and O4) forming hydrogen bonds with HIV protease also interact with VP24. Hence, the predicted binding mode of indinavir to VP24 suggests that the compound may function as VP24 inhibitor.164\n",

            "text": "Drugs that counteract filovirus budding are attractive therapeutics since they would be expected to potently reduce the spread of the viral particles allowing the immune system to gain time for contrasting the infection. Among the seven proteins encoded by EBOV, NP, VP35, and VP24 are requested for NC assembly, and expression of the matrix protein VP40 allows the budding of filamentous virions. The interaction of NP with VP40 is demonstrated to be crucial for NC transport to the cell surface and for its incorporation into virions, leading to the formation of mature virus particles.167 EBOV VP40 contains two late-(L-) domain motifs (PTAP and PPEY) that are critical for efficient egress of virions, as they specifically bind cellular proteins involved in vacuolar protein sorting pathways to facilitate the final step of virus\u2013cell separation.168 The PTAP L-domain recruits host Tsg101, involved in the protein endosomal sorting pathway, while the PPxY motif interacts with the host Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase leading to ubiquitination of VP40 and enhancing viral egress. Small molecules that inhibit these interactions would be predicted to reduce virus budding and spread. In an in silico screening on 2.4 million compounds investigated for inhibiting the binding between PTAP L-domain and Tsg101, the top six scoring molecules identified were tested for their ability to disrupt the VP40-Tsg101 interaction. Of them, 5539-0062 (Fig. 8\n) exhibited PTAP-specific inhibition of the VP40-Tsg101 complex formation and the VP40 VLP egress (40% at 50 \u03bcM and > 90% at 100 \u03bcM). The compound showed specific antiviral activity also in cells infected with a recombinant VSV (VSV-M40) expressing the PTAP L-domain of EBOV VP40.168 Another in silico study combined with functional VLP and virus budding assays identified compounds 4 (Fig. 8) and 5 that have broad-spectrum antibudding activity, including antifiloviruses, by competitively disrupting viral PPxY-host Nedd4 interaction.169 Compound 4 inhibited egress of EBOV VP40 VLPs by 3- and 10-folds at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM, respectively, while compound 5 inhibited it by 3.3- and 7-folds, respectively, at the same concentrations.169\n",

The high mortality rate and the rapid spread of the recent outbreak highlight the need to identify efficacious anti-EBOV therapeutics. To date, several antiviral agents showed inhibitory potency in in vitro studies as well as in animal models and patients. Among them, different drugs already approved have been proposed to be repurposed with the aim of accelerating the process of FDA approval. Analysis of the so far identified anti-EBOV agents based on their mode of action against specific viral proteins or host factors involved in the viral life cycle, shows that the majority of these agents target the viral entry or proteins involved in viral in transcription and genome replication. In addition, a number of compounds targeting cell signaling pathways have also been reported. An example is the modulation of the IFN response, a crucial step at the base of the pathogenesis of EBOV infection. Human clinical data have been reported for different agents such as BCX4430, GS-5734, AVI-6002, AVI-7537 which completed phase I trials, while compounds such as brincidofovir, amiodarone were evaluated in phase II clinical trials that, however, were early terminated. ZMapp is currently considered the best option to treat EBOV patients, in particular in combination with other antiviral agents, such as favipiravir or GS-5734, that likely contributed to the improved outcome. In conclusion, we provide a description of the state-of-the-art in EBOV drug development, focusing on the molecular mechanisms of EBOV infection and reporting the possible strategies that could be exploited by anti-EBOV agents to subvert its virulence.",
