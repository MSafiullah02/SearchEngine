Methods A retrospective analysis of the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination of 19 patients with COVID-19 from the Liyuan Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between January 16, 2020 and February 20, 2020 was undertaken. Results There were 11 male and 8 female cases among the patients. The median (range) age was 73 (38-91) years. Of these patients, 8 (42.1%) had died and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 2 (interquartile range (IQR): 1-10.75) days. Seven of these 8 patients had underlying diseases. The auxiliary examination showed fever (68.4%), dry cough (15.8%), dyspnea (10.5%), and diarrhea (5.3%). All 19 cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography. Serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amylase A (SAA) were clearly increased in all of the cases. Among the 19 cases, there were 16 (84.2%) cases in which the total number of lymphocytes decreased, 12 cases (63%) had reduced liver function, and 11 cases (58%) had deviant results for fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer, in particular, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared with the survivors. Conclusion There were more men than women among critically ill patients. All of the cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography and the vast majority of patients displayed fever and dry cough.

For mildly ill patients, the infection usually clears spontaneously. Nevertheless, severe illnesses develop easily, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple system organ failure, or even death. In this study, more men than women and more older than younger individuals made up the group of critically ill patients, and the median (range) age of the 19 patients was 73 (38-91) years. Eight (42.1%) patients died and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 2 (IQR: 1-10.75) days. These results suggest that sex and age are affecting the risk factors. Patients with a history of underlying disease (high blood pressure or diabetes) are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have the COVID-19 infection. These findings are consistent with previous reports (Chen et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020 ). The susceptibility of a population to infection by this new virus drives the dynamics of a pandemic. The clinical manifestations include fever, fatigue, and dry cough without phlegm. A few patients have nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea (Cui et al.2019; Zhu et al. 2020) . Critically ill patients were more vulnerable to dyspnea, hypoxemia, and even ARDS, irreformable metabolic acidosis, sepsis, and coagulation disturbance after just one week ).
