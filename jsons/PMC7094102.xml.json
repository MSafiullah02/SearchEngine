            "text": "Recent decades have seen a surge of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), with up to forty new diseases recorded since the 1970s (Jones et al., 2008). Sixty percent of emerging human infectious diseases are zoonotic, i.e. are caused by pathogens that have an animal origin (Jones, Patel, Levy, Storeydard, Balk, Gittleman, Daszak, 2008, Taylor, Latham, Woolhouse, 2001). The World Health Organization defines zoonotic pathogens as \u201cpathogens that are naturally transmitted to humans via vertebrate animals\u201d. The epidemics caused by EIDs impact the societal and economical equilibria of countries by causing unexpected deaths and illnesses thereby increasing the need for health care infrastructures and by interfering with travel (Morens and Fauci, 2013). Moreover, the risk of EIDs being transmitted to humans from wildlife is increasing because of the recent growth and geographic expansion of human populations, climate change and deforestation, which all increase the number of contacts between humans and potential new pathogens (Jones, Patel, Levy, Storeydard, Balk, Gittleman, Daszak, 2008, Keesing, Belden, Daszak, Dobson, Harvell, Holt, Hudson, Jolles, Jones, Mitchell, Myers, T, Ostfeld, 2010, Murray, Daszak, 2013). Given most EIDs have an animal origin, it is crucially important to understand how infections spread from animal to human populations, i.e. by spillover transmission.",

The start of an outbreak is promoted by a primary contact between the reservoir and the incidental host (i.e. host that becomes infected but is not part of the reservoir) leading to the potential transmission of the infection to the host population. Moreover, multiple outbreaks are commonly observed during an epidemic of zoonotic pathogens in human populations, for instance in the case of the epidemic of the Nipah Virus between 2001 and 2007 (Luby et al., 2009). With regards to the Ebola virus, some twenty outbreaks have been recorded since the discovery of the virus in 1976 (De La Vega et al., 2015). This number of outbreaks undoubtedly underestimates the total number of emergences because not all emergences necessarily lead to the spread of the infection from an animal reservoir to the host population (Jezek et al., 1999). While the reservoir has an important role for causing the emergence of outbreaks, the role of spillover transmission on the incidental epidemiological dynamics is rarely discussed.",

            "text": "Empirically, it is generally difficult to distinguish between direct transmission and transmission from the reservoir. Only in the case of non-communicable diseases it is easily possible to measure the importance of the recurrent transmission from the reservoir, since all infected individuals originate from a contact with the reservoir. For instance, the H7N9 virus, for which most human cases are due to a contact with an infected poultry, approximately 132 spillovers have been listed during the epidemic of 2013 (Zhou et al., 2013). For pathogens that are able to propagate from one individual to another, the origin of the infection can be established according to patterns of contacts during the incubation period (Chowell, Blumberg, Simonsen, Miller, Viboud, 2014, Luby, Hossain, Gurley, Be-N, Banu, Khan, Homaira, Rota, Rollin, Comer, Kenah, Ksiazek, Rahman, 2009). Most often, if an infected individual has been in contact with another infected individual in his recent past, direct transmission is considered as the likeliest origin of the infection. However, both individuals might have shared the same environment and thus might have been independently infected by the reservoir. This leads to overestimating the proportion of cases that result from person-to-person transmission. Moreover, when the pathogen infects an individual and the latter does not produce secondary cases then the detection of emergence is unlikely.",

It is generally assumed that the epidemiological dynamics of outbreaks is driven by the ability of the pathogen to propagate within hosts. For instance, a classification scheme for pathogens has been proposed by Wolfe et al. (2007), including five evolutionary stages in which the pathogen may evolve ranging from an exclusive animal infection (Stage I) to an exclusive human infection (Stage V) (Fig. 1) (Wolfe et al., 2007). The intermediate stages are those found for the zoonotic pathogens (Stages II\u2013IV). Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009), proposed to enhance the classification scheme by differentiating the Stages II\u2013IV by the ability of pathogens to propagate between individuals in the incidental host (i.e. as a function of the basic reproductive ratio R\n0): the non-contagious pathogens (R0=0, Stage II), pathogens barely contagious inducing stuttering chains of transmission (0 < R\n0 < 1, Stage III) and contagious pathogens inducing large outbreaks (R\n0 > 1, Stage IV) (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009).

(2009) have analysed 442 modelling studies of zoonotic pathogens and concluded that models incorporating spillover transmission are dismayingly rare. More recent models aimed at investigating the dynamics of EIDs by taking into account the spread of the pathogen using multi-host processes but disregarding the persistence of the pathogen in the reservoir (Singh et al., 2013), or by focusing on the dynamics and conditions of persistence of the pathogen between two populations (Fenton and Pedersen, 2005). Models that have considered an endemic reservoir are disease-specific and do not generate generalizable dynamics (Chowell, Blumberg, Simonsen, Miller, Viboud, 2014, Nieddu, Billings, Kaufman, Forgoston, Bianco, 2017). More recently, Singh and Myers (2014) developed a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) stochastic model coupled with a constant force of infection. The authors are mostly interested in the effect of population size and its impact on the size of an outbreak. However, this approach does not allow teasing apart the contribution of the incidental host transmission from that of the transmission from the reservoir in modulating the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens.",

To do so, we developed a continuous time stochastic model that can dissociate the effect of between-host (i.e. direct) transmission from the effect of spillover (i.e. reservoir) transmission. A multi-host process with a reservoir and an incidental host is considered. The epidemiological processes are stochastic, which is particularly relevant in the case of transmission from the reservoir and more realistic because only a small number of individuals are expected to be infected at the beginning of an outbreak. The model makes a number of assumptions. First, the epidemiological processes are much faster than the demographic processes. Second, the pathogen in the reservoir is considered as endemic and might contaminate recurrently the incidental host. Third, an individual cannot become susceptible after having been infected. As a consequence, the total number of susceptible individuals in the incidental host decreases during the epidemic. This is what is expected for an epidemic spreading locally during a short period of time (at the scale of a few thousands individuals during weeks or months, depending on the disease and populations considered). We then harness the model to predict the effects of both spillover transmission and direct transmission on the number and the size of outbreaks. Outbreaks occur when the number of cases of disease increases above the epidemiological threshold. In the case of non emerging infectious diseases, an epidemiological threshold is used to gauge the start of outbreaks. For instance for the seasonal influenza the epidemiological threshold is calculated depending on the incidence of the disease during the previous years (Tay et al., 2013). In the case of emerging infectious diseases, no incidence is normally expected in the population so from a small number of infected individuals, the outbreak can be considered to spread. We show that, regarding the epidemiological dynamics, the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from the reservoir in the incidental host is as important as the transmission between individuals of the incidental host. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for the classification of pathogens proposed by Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009).",

The method of approximation is the following: let us denote by Si the number of susceptible individuals at the beginning of the ith excursion. During the ith excursion, we set this number of susceptibles to its initial value Si, and consider that the rate of new infections is \u03b2ISi. We thus obtain a branching process with individual birth (infection) rate \u03b2Si and individual death (recovery) rate \u03b3. When there is no more infected individuals, we compute the mean number of recovered individuals produced by this branching process excursion, denoted by E[K(Si,\u03b2,\u03b3)], and make the approximation that\n(1)Si+1=Si\u2212E[K(Si,\u03b2,\u03b3)],where E[K(Si,\u03b2,\u03b3)] can be computed and equals (see Appendix A):\n(2)E[K(Si,\u03b2,\u03b3)]=\u03b3\u03b3+\u03b2Si\u2211k=0\u221e(2k)!(k!)2(\u03b3\u03b2Si(\u03b3+\u03b2Si)2)k.In other words, the initial number of susceptible individuals for the (i+1)th excursion is the initial number of susceptible individuals for the ith excursion minus the mean number of recovered individuals produced during the ith excursion under our branching process approximation. We repeat the procedure for the (i+1)th excursion, and so on, until k satisfies Sk > 0 and Sk+1\u22640 (no susceptible anymore). In order to be considered as an outbreak, an excursion has to exceed c individuals, where we recall that c is the epidemiological threshold. Under our branching process approximation, the probability for the ith excursion to reach the epidemiological threshold (see Appendix A) is:\n(3)P(Si,\u03b2,\u03b3)=(\u03b3/\u03b2Si)\u22121(\u03b3/\u03b2Si)c\u22121.As a consequence, our approximation of the mean number of outbreaks (E[O(N,\u03b2,\u03b3)]) reads:\n(4)E[O(N,\u03b2,\u03b3)]=\u2211i=0kP(Si,\u03b2,\u03b3),where S1=N, and the Si\u2019s are computed as described in (1).",

The idea for such an estimation is the following: it is known that if a Poisson process has k jumps during a time interval, the jumps are uniformly distributed during this time interval. As the infections by the reservoir follow approximately a Poisson process with parameter \u03c4N, and we know that in expectation m infections by the reservoir occur before all infected individuals are removed, we divide the epidemic in homogeneous blocks. We choose these blocks to have an initial number of MI infected individuals to allow the use of results on branching processes with immigration. The initial number of infected individuals in each block is thus MI, and as a consequence the infection has a probability\nR0\u2212MI\u22121R0\u2212c\u22121to reach the threshold c (see Appendix C.5). Hence the probability for the whole excursion to reach the threshold c can be approximated by\n1\u2212(1\u2212R0\u2212MI\u22121R0\u2212c\u22121)m/MI.We want this probability to be not too close to 0, otherwise most susceptible individuals would be consumed without giving rise to an outbreak. We also want this probability to be not too close to 1. Indeed, as we have shown in the beginning of this section, this would correspond to a case where \u03c4N/\u03b3 is much larger than c(1\u2212R0) and once the infected number of individuals has reached the value c it would be very likely to reach a large value and consume a large number of susceptible individuals. As a consequence, we would have at the limit only one large outbreak. We thus choose to equalize this probability to one half to get an estimation of \u03c4opt. Notice that this choice is arbitrary but has only a small effect on the final results. For instance, a choice of 0.3 or 0.7 would give very close results. The most important is to stay away from 0 and 1. As a conclusion, \u03c4opt is estimated as the unique solution to:\n(14)(1\u2212R0\u2212MI\u22121R0\u2212c\u22121)mMI=(1\u2212R0\u03c4optNlog(1\u2212R0)\u03b3R0\u22121R0\u2212c\u22121)\u2212\u03b3R0(1\u2212R0)\u2212\u03c4optN/(\u03b3R0)\u03c4optNlog(1\u2212R0)=12.The unicity of the solution is proved in Appendix C.5.",

We analyse the model to predict the number and the size of outbreaks as a function of both the spillover transmission and within host. The model shows that spillover transmission influences the epidemiological dynamics as much as the transmission by direct contact between individuals. Three different dynamics are observed, ranging from the absence of outbreaks to a single large outbreak.

Generally, the occurrence of epidemics in humans is attributed to the ability of the pathogen to propagate between individuals. In the case of a single-host process, the notion of the basic reproductive ratio R\n0 seems sufficient to evaluate the spread of the pathogen in a population entirely composed of susceptible individuals. In EIDs, R\n0 is also used to gauge the risk of pandemics. In this way, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009) delineate the three stages identified for a zoonotic pathogen (Wolfe et al., 2007) by using the ability of the pathogen to spread between individuals. Each stage corresponds to a specific epidemiological dynamics ranging from a non-contagious pathogen making an outbreak impossible (Stage II, R0=0) to a barely contagious pathogen with few outbreaks and stuttering chains of transmission (Stage III, R\n0 < 1) to a contagious pathogen making a large outbreak possible (Stage IV, R\n0 > 1). The aim of the Wolfe\u2019s classification is to establish each stage at which a zoonotic pathogen may evolve to be adapted to human transmission only, in order to identify pathogens at potential risk of pandemics. However, in our model, by taking into account the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from the reservoir, the three dynamics that define the three stages will depend on both the spillover transmission and the direct transmission of the pathogen between individuals.

Without transmission from the reservoir, the probability to have an outbreak when the pathogen is barely contagious only depends on the direct transmission between individuals, and the outbreak rapidly goes extinct. By contrast, the results show that the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from a reservoir increases the probability to observe an outbreak. Spillover transmission enhances the probability to both observe longer chains of transmission and reach the epidemiological threshold (i.e. threshold from which an outbreak is considered) even for a pathogen barely contagious. Moreover, this coupling model (reservoir-human transmission) allows the appearance of multiple outbreaks depending on both the ability of the pathogen to propagate in the population and the transmission from the reservoir. Zoonotic pathogens such as MERS, Ebola or Nipah are poorly transmitted between individuals (R\n0 estimated to be less than 1) (Althaus, 2014, Chowell, Blumberg, Simonsen, Miller, Viboud, 2014, Luby, Hossain, Gurley, Be-N, Banu, Khan, Homaira, Rota, Rollin, Comer, Kenah, Ksiazek, Rahman, 2009, Zumla, Hui, Perlman, 2015) yet outbreaks of dozens/hundreds/thousands of infected individuals are observed. We argue that, as suggested by our model, the human epidemic caused by EIDs could be due to a recurrent spillover from an animal reservoir.",

According to the stochastic SIR model coupled with a reservoir analysed here, the same dynamics can be observed depending on the relative contribution of the transmission from the reservoir and the direct transmission by contact with an infected individual (see Fig. 4). For example, a large outbreak is observed either for a high spillover transmission or for a high direct transmission. The proposed stochastic model makes it possible to understand the effects of the infection from the reservoir or from direct transmission on the epidemiological dynamics in an incidental host when empirically this distinction is difficult. Empirically, the origin of the infection is established by determining the contact patterns of infected individuals during the incubation period. Thereafter, the role of control programs implemented could be evaluated in order to determine better strategies.",

The pathogen is then endemic in the reservoir and the reservoir has a constant force of infection on the incidental host. The reservoir can be seen as an ecological system comprising several species or populations in order to maintain the pathogen indefinitely (Haydon et al., 2002). For example, bat and dromedary camel (Camelus Dromedarius) populations are involved in the persistence of MERS-CoV and in the transmission to human populations (Sabir et al., 2016). In these cases, the assumptions of a constant force of infection can be valid because the pathogen is endemic. However, zoonotic pathogens can spill over multiple incidental hosts and they can infect each other. In the case of the Ebola virus, which infects multiple incidental hosts such as apes, gorillas and monkeys (Ghazanfar et al., 2015), the principal mode of contamination of the human population is the transmission from non-human primate populations. Moreover, the contact patterns between animals and humans is one of the most important risk factors in the emergence of avian influenza outbreaks (Meyer et al., 2017). These different epidemiological dynamics with transmission either from the reservoir or from other incidental hosts can largely impact the dynamics of infection observed in the human population, and the investigations of those effects can enhance our understanding of zoonotic pathogens dynamics.",

Moreover, during the time between two spillovers, the demography in the incidental host can vary and impact the propagation of the pathogen.
