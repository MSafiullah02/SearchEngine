Human coronaviruses including OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 are generally associated with self-limiting respiratory tract infections (Table 1\n) [1, 2\u2022]. However, in the past 12 years, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, SARS and MERS, have been caused by animal coronaviruses that have crossed the species barrier. Despite the severe disease and high case fatality rate associated with SARS and MERS, coronavirus vaccines and antiviral drugs are not yet available. Animal models are needed for pathogenesis studies as well as for evaluation of vaccines and antiviral drugs. We will focus on animal models for these two coronaviruses in this review.",

SARS was first reported in Hong Kong in 2003, and went on to cause over 8000 infections with an approximately 10% case-fatality rate [7, 8]. The newly emerged MERS-CoV, identified in 2012, has caused over 800 infections associated with a case fatality rate of approximately 40% [9\u2022, 10, 11\u2022\u2022]. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first MERS case imported into the United States. The development and evaluation of antiviral drugs and vaccines for SARS and MERS has been challenging, in part because of difficulties in developing animal models that provide consistent and reproducible results.",

The presence and distribution of viral receptors should be similar to that in humans. The virus should replicate in the selected animal species and a correlation should exist between virus titer and disease severity. Finally, animal models should be carefully assessed and selected to meet experimental goals (Figure 1\n). For example, if the primary focus is to elucidate pathogenesis, the animal model should fully replicate key aspects of the disease and immunological reagents must be available. By contrast, the primary outcome in a vaccine efficacy study is a meaningful difference between vaccinated and the unvaccinated control groups; the ability of a vaccine to prevent clinical disease and/or pathology associated with viral replication following challenge provides compelling evidence of vaccine efficacy [12] though at a minimum, differences in challenge virus replication can be assessed as a measure of vaccine efficacy.",

Chest radiograph abnormalities are evident in almost all cases. Etiologic diagnosis is made by virus isolation in culture, polymerase chain reaction assays or serological testing for antibodies to the virus. SARS associated lung pathology was described from examination of post-mortem tissue samples [7, 19, 20, 21]; however, pathologic changes associated with MERS have not been reported, perhaps because autopsies are rarely performed. The findings in SARS were consistent with prolonged inflammation with destruction and desquamation of alveolar pneumocytes. Hyaline-membrane formation, interstitial inflammatory infiltration and intraalveolar hemorrhage were observed [7] and multinucleated giant cells were also seen. The presence of viral antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the lungs.",

Clinical illness was associated with viral replication in the pneumocytes around the terminal bronchioles [28\u2022, 29\u2022]. These findings were consistent with viral load detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral antigen in alveolar pneumocytes detected by IHC.

However, costs, limited availability and individual variation among NHPs make it difficult to conduct studies in large enough sample sizes for statistical evaluation and to draw robust conclusions. Despite these limitations, it is desirable to evaluate coronavirus vaccine candidates in NHPs before proceeding to clinical trials because we have no clinical experience with human coronavirus vaccines. Special consideration should be given to the demographic background (age, sex and source) and the presence of co-pathogens and studies should be carried out in large sample sizes in order to assess statistical significance.",

Young inbred mice supported viral replication but failed to show clinical signs of disease [31, 33]. As in humans infected with SARS-CoV, age seemed to play an important role in disease susceptibility in mice. Twelve-month-old BALB/c mice developed more severe disease than young mice [34, 35]. On intranasal infection, the older mice developed weight loss, ruffled fur and dehydration [34]. Histopathology showed interstitial pneumonitis along with diffuse alveolar damage and viral antigens were detected by IHC in the lungs. The older BALB/c mouse provided an opportunity to study the age-dependent susceptibility of humans to SARS-CoV [35, 36]. Several knockout mice (Rag1\u2212/\u2212, CD1\u2212/\u2212, Beige) were also infected with SARS-CoV in order to determine the role of immune effectors in the disease [31]. STAT 1\u2212/\u2212 mice in the 129S background supported prolonged viral replication and histopathology similar to humans [32, 37].

McCray et al. demonstrated that expression of hACE2 under the control of an epithelial cell-specific promoter K18 resulted in lethal SARS-CoV infection [38]. However, SARS-CoV infection in K18-hACE2 mice was associated with central nervous system disease, which was not a feature of SARS in humans. Tseng et al. developed two lineages of transgenic mice expressing hACE2 under the CAG promoter, a strong composite promoter consisting of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer, the chicken \u03b2-actin promoter, rabbit globulin splicing and polyadenylation sites to drive high levels of gene expression in mammalian expression vectors [39]. The transgene-positive mice (AC70 and AC63) showed robust viral growth, generalized illness and tissue pathology after infection with SARS-CoV [39]. The lethal lineage of mice (AC70) showed a wider spectrum of clinical manifestations, including death, than the nonlethal lineage mice (AC63). Transgenic mice were used for pathogenesis studies and evaluation of vaccines and other therapeutics [40, 41].",

Following intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV, viral replication was observed in the upper and lower respiratory tract with peak replication three days after infection. The virus was cleared seven to ten days after infection [47]. Viral replication was accompanied by pronounced histopathological changes in the lungs including interstitial inflammation, pneumonitis and consolidation. Since hamsters showed no outward signs of clinical illness, exercise wheels (Nalgene activity wheel) were employed to measure their activity (revolutions/night); these activity wheels showed that SARS-CoV infected hamsters were less active from days two to seven post-infection [47, 48]. Primary infection elicited a neutralizing antibody response that provided protection from subsequent infections [47]. Hamsters were suitable for immunoprophylaxis and treatment studies because objective clinical signs were accompanied by high viral titers and pulmonary histopathology [49].",

The ability to elicit clinical disease, viral replication and pathology depends on the expression of the viral receptor, the species and the demographic characteristics of the animal. Infection of young mice with SARS-CoV was not ideal because there was limited histopathology and no clinical disease. However the combination of two approaches, using mouse-adapted SARS-CoV in older mice, resulted in a model of ARDS that represents a more stringent challenge for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy than either alone. Unfortunately, immune defects associated with aging are complex and can influence results of vaccine evaluations [55, 56].",

This has not been the case for MERS-CoV. There are several point mutations in the DPP4 protein of different animal species that limit the ability of the MERS-CoV spike protein to attach to the host receptor. Therefore, without modification of either the receptor or the viral spike protein, animal models for MERS are limited to non-human primates and camels. Recent studies have shown that there is sequence homology between rabbit and human DPP4, raising the possibility that the rabbit may be a promising model for MERS-CoV infection [56a].",

However, reports of immunopathologic reactions in older mice and in non-human primates vaccinated with SARS-CoV vaccines that were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [57, 59, 62, 64] have revealed two concerns about proceeding to clinical trials with SARS-CoV vaccines. First, there is a precedent for coronavirus-vaccine associated disease enhancement; kittens immunized with a vaccinia virus vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus vaccines developed severe disease when they were subsequently infected with FIPV [65]. In these kittens, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitated viral entry into macrophages. The concern that is extrapolated from the FIPV vaccine experience to human SARS-CoV vaccines is whether vaccine recipients will develop more severe disease if they are exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV after neutralizing antibody titers decline. The second concern is whether recipients of a SARS-CoV vaccine would be at risk of developing pulmonary immunopathology following infection with an unrelated human coronavirus, for example, 229E, OC43, HKU1 or NL63 that usually causes mild, self limited disease. Although findings from preclinical evaluation have revealed these concerns, studies in animal models may not be able to provide data to confirm or allay these concerns.",
