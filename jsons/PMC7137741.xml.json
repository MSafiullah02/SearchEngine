In India, although many encephalitis outbreaks have been associated with Japanese encephalitis virus,1 several outbreaks have remained undiagnosed. One such outbreak was documented in Jamshedpur as early as 1954.2 A group of patients was characterised by sudden onset of high-grade fever (101\u2013106\u00b0F), occasional vomiting, rigors, and drowsiness leading to unconsciousness, followed by death in 6\u201348 h. The age of the affected children ranged from 2\u00b75 months to 15 years. The case fatality rate was 52\u00b73%, and CSF findings were within normal limits. The cause was thought to be viral, but laboratory findings were inconclusive. Subsequently, outbreaks of a similar nature were described from Nagpur, Raipur, Bilaspur, and nearby areas of central India in the years 1958, 1965, 1968, 1978, and 1983. Similar outbreaks were reported from Warangal in Andhra Pradesh in 1997 and 2002. In the absence of a defined cause, these outbreaks were tentatively attributed to Reye's syndrome, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, measles, and so on.3, 4, 5\n",

Since no paired samples of serum from the acute and convalescent phases of illness could be obtained from the patients during this outbreak, the results from testing of single-bleed serum samples were assessed in relation to the time after disease onset at which samples were obtained. A smaller proportion (four of 30 [13%]) of serum samples obtained up to 4 days after onset of illness (early samples) were positive for IgM reactive with Chandipura virus, compared with samples obtained later than 4 days after onset of illness (11 of 16 [69%]; p<0\u00b7001). A similar trend was also noted for Chandipura virus-reactive IgG antibodies (3% of early samples positive vs 50% of late samples) and neutralising antibodies (7% vs 83%). The geometric mean titres in early versus late samples were significantly different (6\u00b71 vs 87\u00b74, p<0\u00b7001). Chandipura virus-reactive IgM antibodies were also found in two of five patients with fever but no CNS involvement, and in two of ten family contacts.

Analysis of partial G gene sequences showed that the genome of the Chandipura virus strain associated with this outbreak was distinct from that of the reference strain obtained in 1965. Importantly, in one fatal encephalitis case from this outbreak, both Chandipura viral antigen and RNA were detected in situ in the post-mortem brain tissue. The clinical presentation of this patient was representative of the symptoms seen in most of the other patients reported during the present outbreak. Chandipura virus was also subsequently isolated from this tissue. Therefore, the presence of the virus in the brain was probably the cause of CNS pathology leading to encephalitis in this patient. Moreover, the presence of Chandipura virus RNA in nine patients with encephalitis, all from samples obtained before day 4 after onset of illness, suggests an early viraemic phase of the infection process. That five of six virus isolates were obtained from such early samples further strengthens this observation.",

In India, these insects are more prevalent in the early monsoon period, a season that coincided with the present outbreak. The isolation of Chandipura virus from sandflies,15, 16 human beings,17 and vertebrates;18 the presence of reactive antibodies in human beings and other vertebrate hosts;19 and the ability of sandflies and mosquitoes to transmit the virus to susceptible hosts;20, 21, 22, 23 represents a broad eco-cycle of the virus in nature.
