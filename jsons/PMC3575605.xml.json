            "text": "In 1823, Charles Billard described what could be argued to be the first case report of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) as gangrenous enterocolitis in a small weak infant with infection, inflammation, and necrosis of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).1 This report was followed in 1850 by a publication of a series of 25 term and preterm infants who presented with nonspecific clinical signs that rapidly progressed and resulted in death and who demonstrated similar pathologic findings on postmortem examinations.1 With the advent of special care nurseries in Europe during the first part of the twentieth century, the clinical description of NEC began to emerge; by the latter half, this disease was widely recognized as the most serious gastrointestinal emergency in intensive care nurseries worldwide. In 1965, Mizrahi and colleagues2 first used the term necrotizing enterocolitis to describe a clinical syndrome consisting of vomiting, abdominal distension, shock, and intestinal hemorrhage and perforation. The initial surgical approach to this disease was formulated by Touloukian3 and Santulli and colleagues4 in the 1970s. In 1978, Bell and colleagues5 classified NEC into 3 stages based on the severity of the clinical presentation and recommended treatment strategies. Despite incremental advances in our understanding of the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of NEC, universal prevention of this serious and often fatal disease continues to elude us even in the twenty-first century.",

A recent Swedish study found that 5.8% of infants born before 27 weeks of PMA developed NEC among a cohort of 638 infants.16 A Swiss neonatal network study reported that only 3% to 4% of infants born at less than 32 weeks of PMA during 2000 to 2004 developed NEC.17 The Canadian Neonatal Network documented that 5.1% of infants born earlier than 33 weeks of PMA developed NEC during 2003 to 2008 in a population of 16,669 infants.18 Despite the improvement in survival of VLBW infants, neonatal NEC remains quite prevalent in the United States (0.3\u20132.4 infants per 1000 live births).19\n",

The authors think that additional prospective reports that use a more robust design and analysis are needed before a causative relationship can be accepted because of the weaknesses in study designs of these investigations (eg, failure to include all BT, retrospective nature of data collection, lack of appropriate case-control matching, and failure to control for confounding variables). A recently completed prospective, matched, case-control investigation that used robust methodology does not substantiate an association between BT and NEC.",

Normally after birth, exposure to LPS downregulates IL-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK), an intermediary for epithelial TLR4 signaling, and promotes tolerance to LPS.19, 22, 43 This postnatal adaptation helps to achieve host-microbe homeostasis with microbial tolerance.22, 44 Premature infants are exposed shortly after birth to a massive microbial antigenic challenge that may be distorted by frequent and prolonged use of antibiotics. As a result, the GIT of premature infants gravitates toward mounting an inflammatory response rather than establishing tolerance (T-helper-1 response).30, 35, 47 The premature infant seems to mimic a response that is similar to the immune-na\u00efve response demonstrated by the fetus, which is characterized by hyper-responsiveness to LPS.22, 48\n",

Intestinal signs in early NEC can present as feeding intolerance that may manifest as increased prefeeding gastric residuals, emesis, abdominal distension, and bloody stools (hematochezia). Less commonly, when the stomach is involved, NEC can present as bloody emesis or a bloody gastric residual.95, 96 During the advanced stage of NEC, the abdomen may appear shiny, distended, and erythematous. Infants generally prefer to assume a frog-leg position (position of comfort, Fig. 5\nA) and are hyporesponsive.6, 94, 95, 96 On gentle palpation, the abdomen may feel firm, tense, and tender, and a tender mass may be palpable. Bowel perforation may cause the abdomen to appear blue or discolored.6, 94, 95, 96 An infant with a blue discolored abdomen secondary to isolated intestinal perforation may be indistinguishable from an infant with NEC. In a male infant, erythema or bluish discoloration of the scrotum may appear if peritoneal fluid from perforated bowel herniates into the scrotum (see Fig. 5B).",

A persistent, fixed, dilated loop may indicate a necrotic bowel loop.

In a supine position, it may appear as a rounded or oval extraluminal lucency beneath the upper anterior abdominal wall (Fig. 9\n). When there is a large pneumoperitoneum, it may outline the falciform ligament giving it the appearance of a longitudinal strip of sutures in a football (American football and rugby but not soccer ball), leading to its designation as the football sign (see Fig. 9).106, 107 A cross-table lateral film may demonstrate small air collection just beneath the abdomen (see Fig. 9). A small pneumoperitoneum may be difficult to visualize on a single plain film. A left lateral decubitus film will allow free air to rise to the top over a nondependent surface, facilitating visualization of an abnormal lucency. A small amount of free air may present as a small triangular or a rectangular lucency and make a definitive diagnosis of free air difficult. Sometimes free air may present as a double-wall sign when the bowel loop is outlined and gas is present along serosal and mucosal surfaces.106, 107\n",

Prompt decompression of the GIT should be accomplished by the placement of a double-lumen gastric tube (large lumen for aspiration and small lumen for irrigation and venting) with the institution of low, constant suction. Aspirated volume should be replaced with intravenous Ringer lactate solution with extra potassium chloride that is lost in gastric output. It is crucial to ensure the patency of the tube. If the abdomen continues to distend despite ongoing continuous suction, the tube should be checked for proper placement and for blockage and nasal continuous positive airway pressure should be discontinued. Endotracheal intubation is preferred in infants who are deteriorating and have frequent episodes of apnea. Intravascular volume must be monitored rigorously to ensure adequate tissue perfusion and may be gauged by frequent assessment of serum electrolytes, hematocrit, and urinary output. As a rule of thumb, anticipation of third spacing in infants with NEC will require 1.5-fold maintenance fluid plus replacement of gastric output. Failure to maintain euvolemia and proper electrolyte repletion can result in shock with hypochloremia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. Parenteral nutrition should be started early with adequate protein (3.5\u20134.0 g/kg/d) to maintain positive nitrogen balance and to allow the repair of injured tissue.6, 46, 109, 110, 111\n",

Following the culture of blood and urine, prompt initiation of treatment with appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics based on known sensitivities of prevalent pathogens in the individual neonatal intensive care unit is vital. If surgical intervention is performed, peritoneal fluid and intestinal tissue should be sent for gram stain, culture, and sensitivity. The utility of a stool culture for bacteria in neonates has been questioned because fecal matter has many bacterial species. However, during outbreaks of NEC, attempts should be made to identify the infectious agent whenever possible. Usual regimens include ampicillin (or a cephalosporin) and gentamicin (or other aminoglycoside). The addition of a third antibiotic that provides anaerobic coverage (eg, clindamycin or metronidazole) is indicated when there is evidence of peritonitis or bowel perforation (see Fig. 11). Inflammation of the intestine and peritoneum is excruciatingly painful; therefore, attention to pain control and minimal handling during cares are integral parts of management.6, 46, 109, 110, 111\n",

However, these studies did not distinguish between isolated perforation and NEC.120 Neither of these two trials reached the recruitment target nor showed improved survival from PPD or laparotomy. One of these two trials [Necrotizing Enterocolitis Trial (NET) from the United Kingdom] found that 74% of infants initially treated with PPD required a rescue laparotomy. The second NICHD NRN trial did not encourage rescue laparotomy (which nonetheless was allowed) and did not distinguish NEC from isolated intestinal perforation (IIP).117, 118, 119 This latter trial, conducted in extremely low birth weight infants (\u22641000 g), found that laparotomy had an advantage over PPD with respect to the likelihood of survival and better neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 to 22 months of age.120 Death or impairment occurred in 78% of the drainage group and in 66% of the laparotomy group.",

Gas bubbles (pneumatosis intestinalis) can be seen in mucosa, submucosa, and serosal surfaces (Fig. 12\n).125 Although NEC can involve the gut from the stomach to the distal colon (NEC totalis), disease is most commonly found in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. Rotavirus-associated NEC most often involves the distal colon.75 NEC can cause focal disease or manifest as multiple large diffuse necrotic areas alternating with patches of unaffected bowel. Serosal exudation without obvious perforation can also occur. In mild stages of NEC, intense congestion of superficial mucosa can result in focal necrosis of villous tips and epithelial sloughing into bowel lumen.124, 125\n",
