            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel member of the genus Deltacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. The disease caused by this virus is characterized by severe watery diarrhoea and vomiting in neonatal piglets. It is symptomatically indistinguishable from diarrhoea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Li et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015; Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014), but presents more mildly and with lower mortality in piglets (30%\u201340%) than typical PEDV infection (Hu, Jung, et al., 2015). Since its initial isolation in the United States in February 2014 (Li et al., 2014; McCluskey et al., 2016; Marthaler et al., 2014), PDCoV has been identified in Canada, South Korea, China and Thailand. Molecular surveillance of diarrhoeal samples of pigs from the United States indicated a 30% infection of PDCoV, which is considered a common viral pathogen of pigs (Marthaler et al., 2014; Zhang, 2016; Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2016). However, owing to the fact that the PDCoV is a recently emerging viral pathogen, there is limited knowledge about the virus (Thachil, Gerber, Xiao, Huang, & Opriessnig, 2015). There are presently no effective treatments or vaccines available to control PDCoV (Hu, Jung, et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The PDCoV is an enveloped, positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA virus. The full genome of PDCoV is approximately 25.4 kb in length (Woo et al., 2012), encodes two polymerase proteins (ORF1a/b) gene, four major structural proteins for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as non\u2010structural protein 6 (NS6) and non\u2010structural protein 7 (NS7) (Lee & Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014). The functions of PDCoV individual proteins have not been elucidated. However, among the structural proteins of the other coronaviruses, the S protein is known to play pivotal roles in interacting with the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry and is an antigenic target for neutralizing antibodies (Park, Song, Ha, & Park, 2007; Sato et al., 2011). The M protein is a transmembrane protein that is responsible for the transport of nutrients across the membrane. In addition, the M protein plays an important role in viral assembly, as well as the induction of virus neutralization antibodies (Fan, Zuo, Li, & Pei, 2012). The coronavirus N protein binds viral RNA and highly conserved. It is involved in several of the biological activities of the virus (Chang et al., 2006; Molenkamp & Spaan, 1997). The S, M and N protein genes have been targeted for the development of virological and serological diagnostic assays for PDCoV (Chen, Gauger, et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015; Marthaler et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015; Su et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular characteristics of the prevalent strains and its relevance to the development of diagnostic reagents, assays and potential vaccines against emergent PDCoV strains. Although some publications have reported the detection of PDCoV RNA in domestic pigs in mainland China (Chen, Zhu, et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang, Yue, Fang, & Huang, 2015), a few have reported on the isolation of PDCoV or the characteristics of those isolates.",

To detect the PDCoV genome in the collected samples, viral RNAs were extracted from samples using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript\u2122 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) with an oligo dT primer.

In addition, molecular detection of the other three diarrhoea\u2010related enteric viruses, PEDV, TGEV and porcine rotavirus (PRoV), was performed using previously reported methods for further evaluation of possible coinfection status with PDCoV (Hu, Li, et al., 2015; Jeong et al., 2009; Sun, Leng, Zhai, Chen, & Song, 2014).",

Both PDCoV HB\u2010BD and PDCoV/NH had a unique base insertion in the 5\u2032\u2010UTR (150C151). By comparing S gene with those PDCoV reference strains, a 3\u2010nt (AAT, from 154 to 156) deletion was observed in the S gene of the HB\u2010BD strain, which was also present in other Chinese PDCoV strains, with the exception of PDCoV strains, CHN\u2010AH\u20102004 and HKU15\u201044. This unique feature in the S gene can be used as a genetic marker to discriminate PDCoV strains in China from those in the United States, South Korea and Thailand (Chen, Zhu, et al., 2015).

In China, as PDCoV HKU15\u201044 and HKU15\u2010155 strains were first identified in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012), PDCoV has been reported in some local provinces and the prevalence of PDCoV has been investigated (Chen, Zhu, et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). In one study, 64 faecal and intestinal samples collected from six pig farms in the Shanxi, Guangdong and Hubei provinces in China, were examined for enteropathogens using RT\u2010PCR (Chen, Zhu, et al., 2015). The prevalence of PDCoV infection was 23.4% (15/64). In one survey performed by Song et al. (2015), 356 porcine faecal/intestinal samples that were collected between November 2012 and March 2015 from diarrhoeic pigs on 51 farms in Jiangxi province, China, were examined using nested RT\u2010PCR. The result showed that monoinfection with PDCoV was 33.71% (120/356) and coinfection with PDCoV and PEDV was 19.66% (70/356), thus 58.33% (70/120) of the PDCoV\u2010positive samples were co\u2010infected with PEDV. In the study performed by Dong et al. (2015), 215 intestinal or faecal samples were collected from piglets with clinical diarrhoea at various times during 2004\u20132014 in Anhui, Guangxi, Hubei and Jiangsu provinces, of mainland China, for the detection of enteropathogens. Among these samples, 14 (6.51%) were positive for PDCoV and 50% (7/14) of the 14 PDCoV\u2010positive samples were also positive for PEDV. These results showed that PDCoV coinfections with other pathogens, especially PEDV, are more common in these provinces. However, little is known about the prevalence of PDCoV in Hebei province, a major pig\u2010rearing province in China. In the present study, 49 faecal and intestinal samples from piglets with diarrhoea on different farms in Hebei province were collected, from which PDCoV was detected using RT\u2010PCR. Other general enteropathogens, such as PEDV, TGEV and PRoV, were also examined. Five (10.2%) of the 49 samples were positive for PDCoV, 31 (63.3%) were positive for PEDV, and two (4.1%) were positive for PRoV. Although the prevalence of PDCoV infection was lower than that of PEDV, the result indicates that PDCOV infection exists in the Hebei pig population. Interestingly, no coinfection with PDCoV and PEDV was detected. In addition, all five PDCoV\u2010positive samples were negative for all other enteropathogens detected in the present study. These findings are somewhat different from observations of infection with PDCoV in other provinces and other countries. If a greater number of samples were collected, some coinfection might have been detected.",

            "text": "Although the prevalence of PDCoV in some provinces of China has been confirmed and the genetic characteristics of some Chinese PDCoV strains and those from other countries have been analysed, there is little published information about Chinese PDCoV isolates. In the present study, using ST cells, the PDCoV HB\u2010BD strain was successfully isolated from the intestinal contents of a piglet with diarrhoea. After several passages, propagation of PDCoV HB\u2010BD was confirmed by the detection of a typical CPE and infectious virus titration. The M, N and S gene sequences of HB\u2010BD were also determined. To confirm whether the replication of any other swine enteric viruses occurred on ST cells, the cell culture\u2010passaged samples were detected by RT\u2010PCR and tested negative for PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV and PRoV. These results all indicate that the PDCoV HB\u2010BD isolate was highly adapted to ST cells. The findings of Hu, Jung, et al. (2015) and Dong et al. (2016) indicate that the success rate of PDCoV isolation from samples of intestinal contents is relatively higher than that from faecal samples. However, even if the PDCoV virus is isolated from intestinal contents, the success rate is also influenced by other factors, such as virus viability, infectious virus titres and other substances in the intestinal contents (Hu, Jung, et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016). In the present study, we attempted to isolate the virus from two intestinal content samples and three faecal samples that were positive for PDCoV. However, in the ST cells, only the PDCoV HB\u2010BD strain was successfully isolated from intestinal contents. The success rate of virus isolation is relatively low. These results are consistent with those of previous reports (Dong et al., 2016; Hu, Jung, et al., 2015).",

The HB\u2010BD strain had a closer relationship with other Chinese strains than those from other countries and was grouped within the Chinese PDCoV cluster in the phylogenetic trees. When compared with the Chinese strains, HB\u2010BD strain showed most closely related to the NH strain (emerged in Heilongjiang province) and the HKU15\u2010155 strain (isolated in Hong Kong). Based on the S gene, HB\u2010BD shared the highest aa identity (99.2%) with the NH strain. In addition, both strains have two aa mutations (L45H and Y123H). However, based on the N gene, the HB\u2010BD strain had the highest aa identity (99.4%) with HKU15\u2010155 and shared a similar aa substitution (V43A). Further analysis showed that HB\u2010BD had four further aa mutations (H149Y, R888T, A894T and G910C) in the S gene, one further aa mutation (A308V) in the N gene and a unique nucleotide mutation (C63T) in the M gene. Studies have shown that the S protein of coronaviruses is associated with receptor binding and host adaptation (Graham & Baric, 2010; Sato et al., 2011) and the N protein participates in viral transcription and replication (Brian & Baric, 2005). Further research in HB\u2010BD should be conducted to understand whether these mutations can lead to changes in virulence, pathogenicity and antigenicity of PDCoV.",
