[3] also reported that an increased interleukin 6 (IL-6) blood level was a negative prognostic factor for survival, as death was more frequent in patients with higher levels of IL-6. Furthermore IL-6 levels were directly related to the more severe lung damage [4]. Interestingly, in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), similarly induced by a coronavirus, an exaggerated immune response is thought to be the cause of a lethal disease, independently from viral titers and particularly in the post acute phase of the disease [5]. Noteworthy, therapeutic interventions aimed towards reducing viral load were reported to be somewhat beneficial when administered early, but not during later stages, in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which is also caused by a coronavirus [6].",

Treatment effect on survival was independent from baseline clinical conditions as age, comorbid diseases as diabetes, hypertension, level of PCR or heart diseases. Considering patients whose outcome is known, the number of completely recovered patients higher in the group of patients who received tocilizumab (92%) than in the group of patients who received only standard care (42.1%). Furthermore, for still hospitalized patients, a more favorable clinical course was described in patients receiving tocilizumab in terms of respiratory support and SpO2. On the contrary all still hospitalized control patients resulted to be worsened and needed mechanical ventilation. Notably, no infections were recorded in the tocilizumab group.",

Also, it has been hypothesized that the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV itself could enhance the IL-6 expression [14]. The findings of the current retrospective observational study support the presence of similar mechanisms also in COVID-19 pneumonia, as reported in previous research [15]. It is worth noting that patients included in this study were treated relatively early in the course of their respiratory failure -as shown by the fact that none of them needed mechanical ventilation at admission to the hospital- with the aim to reduce the excessive immune response associated with the development of lung damage, without abolishing the immune response toward the virus.",
