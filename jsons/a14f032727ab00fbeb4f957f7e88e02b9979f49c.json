This review focuses on several aspects of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) including epidemiology, diagnosis and management. COPD poses a major health and economic burden in the Asia-Pacific region, as it does worldwide. Triggering factors of AECOPD include infectious (bacteria and viruses) and environmental (air pollution and meteorological effect) factors. Disruption in the dynamic balance between the 'pathogens' (viral and bacterial) and the normal bacterial communities that constitute the lung microbiome likely contributes to the risk of exacerbations. The diagnostic approach to AECOPD varies based on the clinical setting and severity of the exacerbation. After history and examination, a number of investigations may be useful, including oximetry, sputum culture, chest X-ray and blood tests for inflammatory markers. Arterial blood gases should be considered in severe exacerbations, to characterize respiratory failure. Depending on the severity, the acute management of AECOPD involves use of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, oxygen and noninvasive ventilation. Hospitalization may be required, for severe exacerbations. Nonpharmacological interventions including disease-specific self-management, pulmonary rehabilitation, early medical follow-up, home visits by respiratory health workers, integrated programmes and telehealth-assisted hospital at home have been studied during hospitalization and shortly after discharge in patients who have had a recent AECOPD. Pharmacological approaches to reducing risk of future exacerbations include long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, mucolytics, vaccinations and long-term macrolides. Further studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in preventing COPD exacerbations.",

In a recent population-based survey conducted in nine Asia-Pacific territories, the prevalence of COPD was estimated at 6.2%. 4 Of patients with COPD, 46% had at least one exacerbation in the previous year, and 19% required hospitalization. 4 A study from Hokkaido, Japan, reported an exacerbation frequency ranging from 0.06 to 0.78 events per person per year. 5 Patients with exacerbations in the first year of the study had more frequent AECOPD during follow-up and worse quality of life (QOL). 5 The COPD is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and acute exacerbations contribute substantially to this. COPD was the fifth leading cause of death in 2002 and will rank third by 2030. 6 In Hong Kong, COPD ranked as the third leading cause of respiratory death, after respiratory infection and cancer. 7 A Japanese study of 177 207 patients admitted with COPD as the primary condition or comorbidity found a higher mortality in patients with older age, male gender, lower body mass index (BMI), more severe dyspnoea, lower level of consciousness and worse activities of life. 8 A New Zealand study of patients with AECOPD requiring hospitalization found that the CURB65 score (0 to 1, 2 and 3 to 5) was associated with increasing 30-day mortality rate (2.0%, 6.7% and 21.3%, respectively). 9 Impairment of working ability or early retirement in COPD patients due to physical disability contributes to a substantial socioeconomic loss and health expenditure. A survey in 2008 of 8217 COPD patients (48% male) performed in rural areas of Xuzhou, China, found that a high proportion of patients (36%) required hospitalization due to respiratory symptoms, with a total indirect economic loss estimated at 4 327 050 yuan ($US 678 000). 10 These patients were found to have poor knowledge about COPD, and the treatment given during both the stable and acute exacerbation states did not match international standards, which could partly explain the high exacerbation rate. 10 ",

Continuous surveillance of the prevailing organisms and their antibiotic resistance pattern is warranted. Co-infection by virus and bacteria at the time of AECOPD is not uncommon, ranging from 9% to 19%. An Australian study found that AECOPD patients with co-infection had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s, a longer length of hospital stay and higher likelihood of hospital readmission. 13 ",

Recent data from Tian et al. from Hong Kong showed a reduction in hospitalization for COPD and respiratory tract infections after short-term exposure to ambient CO. 24, 30 The effect was robust even after the adjustment of other pollutants, weather variables and the lag days of CO exposure.

Experimental infection with rhinovirus increased the total bacterial load in sputum samples of patients with COPD, with 'outgrowth' and dominance of H. influenzae occurring at 2 to 6 weeks after viral infection, which suggests that acute viral infection changes the community composition of the lung microbiome. 45 A complex microbiome with diverse bacterial communities has been demonstrated both in endotracheal aspirates from mechanically ventilated patients with severe AECOPD 46 and in sputum samples obtained from patients experiencing a moderate exacerbation. 47 Bacterial community composition may be relatively stable in sputum samples at the start of an exacerbation and during recovery over 3 months. 48 However, other studies have found that the structure and diversity of both bacterial and fungal genera in the sputum microbiome can change rapidly each day, as shown in hospitalized COPD patients with a severe exacerbation. 49 Similarly, we have observed dynamic and rapid changes of the airway microbiome in a study of 23 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients hospitalized for antibiotic therapy during an acute exacerbation. 50 In the CF population, there was an increase in microbial diversity and a reduction in the relative abundance of Pseudomonas by day 3 of intravenous antibiotics, but by days 8 to 10 of the admission, bacterial community composition had returned to pretreatment levels. Whether similar changes occur in the lung microbiome with treatment during an AECOPD is not clear, but a recent small study (six patients only) 49 suggests that this may indeed be the case.",

In a 13-week study of 99 patients with COPD, there was no change in airway bacterial load (measured by 16S quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)) with the use of azithromycin, pulsed moxifloxacin or doxycycline (compared with placebo). 52 Despite no apparent reduction in bacterial load in these initial reports, characterization of changes in the airway microbiome remains an important goal in patients using long-term antibiotics, because beneficial changes in the community dynamics of the microbiome could occur, but without appreciable change in total bacterial load.

Nebulizers and MDI with spacers have demonstrated equal efficacy in relieving acute airflow obstruction, 53 with no significant difference in length of hospital stay. 54 A recent Cochrane review found no difference in outcomes for nebulizers and MDI with spacers in patients with acute asthma; 55 a similar appraisal of the evidence specific to COPD patients is awaited. In addition to clinical endpoints, the relative lung distribution of salbutamol appears to be similar for nebulizer versus MDI with spacer. 56 There are theoretical benefits in favour of MDI with spacers, including faster administration, improved cost-effectiveness and increased opportunity for inhaler technique education. Nebulizers are known to generate aerosols, 57 which may be important in the transmission of infection. The familiarity of staff and patients with each delivery method may vary, and patient factors including reduced level of consciousness or severe dyspnoea may be relevant, necessitating an individually tailored decision.

However, steroid use is associated with many adverse events, especially with the cumulative dose due to the recurrent nature of AECOPD. There is currently no consensus on the standard regimen of systemic corticosteroids, in regard to dose, route and duration for AECOPD. The recommended steroid regimens by the Global Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guideline 3 and respiratory societies in the Asia-Pacific region are shown in Table 2 . [60] [61] [62] [63] Studies suggest that use of oral corticosteroids at low dose is as effective as intravenous corticosteroids given at high dose, while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. 59 The Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD (REDUCE) trial showed that a 5-day course of oral corticosteroids was not inferior to a 14-day course in terms of exacerbation recurrence but with a shorter length of hospital stay. 64 A Cochrane review 65 suggested that a short course, 3 to 7 days, of systemic corticosteroids does not lead to increase in treatment failure or risk of relapse of AECOPD. Data regarding the use of systemic corticosteroids are limited in the Asia-Pacific region. A Turkish study comparing efficacy between oral steroid and intravenous methylprednisolone 66 found that the improvement of blood gas parameters, symptom scores, length of stay and readmission due to AECOPD were comparable with these two treatments. However, the group receiving intravenous methylprednisolone had more events of recurrent AECOPD requiring attendance to emergency department, hyperglycaemia and worsened blood pressure control. 67 The scarcity of data is also indirectly reflected by the inconsistent corticosteroids regimens noted in a Taiwanese observational study of AECOPD. 68 There have been relatively few studies of the use of nebulized corticosteroids for exacerbations, as an alternative to systemic steroids.",

In contrast, for outpatient treatment, the quality of evidence for benefit was generally low and was not statistically significant when the analysis was restricted to currently available antibiotics (as opposed to antibiotics used in older studies). For patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), there was high quality evidence from 1 trial which showed a statistically significant effect on mortality. A retrospective clinical audit in an Australian hospital found that inpatient antibiotic regimens frequently diverged from published clinical guidelines and that discordance was associated with longer length of stay and greater healthcare costs. 70 Oxygen Supplemental oxygen therapy is often required in the treatment of AECOPD. The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand has produced endorsed guidelines for acute oxygen use. 71 To avoid the consequences of hypoxaemia and hyperoxaemia, supplemental oxygen should be titrated to target oxygen saturations of 88-92% in patients with COPD or other chronic respiratory diseases. Pulse oximetry should be employed routinely, and consideration given to arterial blood gas measurement. Patients with high or increasing FiO 2 requirements may require close observation or admission to a high dependency unit/ICU facility. Where nebulizers are used for administration of bronchodilators, an air-driven nebulizer is preferred. 71, 72 Noninvasive ventilation",

            "text": "One of the major breakthroughs in treating AECOPD patients in the last few decades is the application of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Use of NIV effectively unloads the respiratory muscles and reduces the effort on the work of breathing. NIV reduces intubation rate, overall mortality due to respiratory failure and rates of invasive mechanical ventilation-related complications. 73 Based on the evidence from studies in the Asia-Pacific region and Western countries, NIV is now recommended by clinical guidelines as first-line treatment for acute type 2 respiratory failure due to AECOPD. 3,60-63 The criteria for initiation of NIV include respiratory acidosis (arterial pH \u2264 7.35 and/or partial arterial carbon dioxide concentration (PaCO 2 ) \u2265 6.0 kPa or 45 mm Hg), severe dyspnoea with clinical signs indicating fatigue of respiratory muscles, increased work of breathing or both. These signs include retraction of the intercostal spaces, use of respiratory accessory muscles and paradoxical movement of the abdomen. 3 When NIV is used together with effective pharmacological treatment, many patients will demonstrate recovery and be able to be weaned from NIV, with mean duration of use ranging from 2 to 10 days. [74] [75] [76] Regarding adverse effects, the use of NIV has been linked to claustrophobia, skin abrasion over the application site of the mask interface, gastric distension and pneumonia, although the incidence of pneumonia is less common than with invasive mechanical ventilation. 77 ",

In an Italian study of hospitalized AECOPD patients, 55% had arterial hypertension, 27% had chronic heart failure, and 17% had ischaemic heart disease. 86 Only a limited number of studies have been conducted in the Asia-Pacific region regarding the cardiovascular comorbidity in AECOPD patients. A study from Australia observed that cardiovascular events contributed to 26% of long-term mortality following the first episode of AECOPD. 87 A study from Italy found that in patients admitted to the hospital for AECOPD, cardiac troponin elevation emerged as an independent predictor of increased risk of allcause mortality. 88 It is not certain whether AECOPD increases cardiac stress and exacerbates cardiac comorbidity, therefore leading to excessive mortality related to cardiovascular events during or after an AECOPD.

However, heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up time and outcome measures have made it difficult to formulate clear recommendations regarding the most effective form and content of selfmanagement in COPD. 92 In the only study that has recruited patients immediately following an AECOPD (155 patients with AECOPD after hospital discharge from centres in Spain and Belgium), 93 intervention consisted of an individually tailored care plan upon discharge that was shared with the primary care team, as well as accessibility to a specialized nurse case manager through a web-based call centre. The intervention resulted in lower rates of hospitalization and readmissions, although there was no difference in mortality at 12-month follow-up. 93 Another systematic review that examined the effects of self-management alone delivered during hospitalization for an AECOPD or within 1 month of hospital discharge found no effects on mortality rate, depressive symptoms, primary care usage or exercise capacity. Minimal effects were found on self-efficacy, anxiety symptoms and health-promoting behaviour. 94 Self-management interventions delivered immediately post-AECOPD vary widely, and outcome measures are inconsistent. Such variations have made it difficult to draw strong recommendations regarding effectiveness. Further studies on self-management interventions, preferably delivered by trained healthcare professionals to selected patients with structured follow-up, are required.",

            "text": "Evidence-based clinical guidelines for COPD include recommendations for interventions targeted at preventing exacerbations, 110 including a range of inhaled, oral and injectable medicines that reduce the frequency of COPD exacerbations. Inhaled long-acting \u03b2 2 agonists, alone or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids, and inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists all reduce exacerbation rates. The oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, roflumilast, is associated with fewer exacerbations in COPD patients with a phenotype of chronic bronchitis and history of prior exacerbations. 111 Oral mucolytic agents such as N-acetylcysteine also reduce acute exacerbations. 112 Vaccination against both influenza and pneumococcal infections is advocated as part of overall care of COPD patients. A checklist of recommendations can help to remind clinicians about the importance of preventing future exacerbations, especially at the time of hospital discharge. 113 Despite such treatment recommendations, AECOPD still occurs frequently and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is thus an urgent need for more effective strategies to prevent exacerbations. Macrolide antibiotics have shown promise in other chronic lung diseases, prompting recent interest in prophylactic use in patients with COPD. Nine RCT have reported the effects of prophylactic macrolide antibiotics on risk of exacerbations of COPD. 51, [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] Furthermore, two systematic reviews found a statistically significant reduction in COPD exacerbations with the use of long-term macrolides. 122, 123 In the Cochrane systematic review of Herath and Poole, covering five of the studies, the number needed to treat to prevent one exacerbation was eight. 122 In the meta-analysis of Ni et al, the unadjusted risk ratio of an acute exacerbation with macrolide treatment was 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.87; P < 0.01). 123 Subgroup analysis suggests that 6 months of macrolide therapy is the minimum treatment duration necessary to demonstrate significant reductions in COPD exacerbations. 122, 123 Although these pooled analyses demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in total score for the St George Respiratory Questionnaire with macrolide use, this failed to reach the minimal clinically important difference. 122, 123 Frequency of hospitalization and all-cause mortality did not differ between macrolide and placebo groups. 122, 123 These systematic reviews suggest that more studies are required to determine optimal treatment regimen Hot topics on acute exacerbation of COPD (dose, individual agent and duration) and that patient selection needs to be further explored as perhaps subpopulations of patients with COPD may derive greater benefit. Adverse effects are an important concern given that patients with COPD are generally older with associated multimorbidities, and the potential for increased antimicrobial resistance needs to be considered. In summary, while emerging evidence suggests that continuous macrolide therapy reduces exacerbation frequency in COPD, there are many questions that remain to be addressed before this treatment can be routinely recommended in clinical practice. The challenge is to identify the patients with COPD who will benefit the most from macrolides while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.",

Environmental factors including air pollution and meteorological effects also influence the rate of AECOPD. The approach to diagnostic tests for AECOPD consists of characterizing gas exchange, infection and inflammation. Acute management typically involves use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and/or systemic steroids and, if severe, oxygen and NIV. Further studies are needed to assess the different types of nonpharmacological interventions available shortly post-AECOPD, as well as pharmacotherapy to reduce future risk of exacerbations, for identification of the efficacious components and overall cost-effectiveness.",
