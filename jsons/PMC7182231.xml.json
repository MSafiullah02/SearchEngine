With the advent of molecular assays, the description of childhood infections caused by non-HRSV has further demonstrated the implication of these diseases in long-term sequelae [12,13]. A meta-analysis by Liu et al., have demonstrated the association between childhood RV infections and the subsequent development of asthma [13]. A systematic review showed that pneumonia mainly due to Adenovirus was linked to sequelae including obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic bronchitis [12]. The subgroup analyses in this latter however found that the 3 included studies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were not associated with long-term sequelae [12].",

We evaluated the publication bias by visual inspection of funnel diagram and Egger test. We estimated heterogeneity between studies by the Q test and the I2 statistic [27,28]. We considered heterogeneity as significant between studies for p-value <0.1 or I2> 50%. We conducted sensitivity analyses with studies with a low risk of bias, studies including only inpatients or the first episode of viral LRTI. We performed subgroup analyses on the basis of the type of LRTI, WHO region, age at LRTI, age at follow up, and type of virus detected in LRTI. We applied a multivariate metaregression with a stepwise manual selection procedure to identify factors associated with the variation of overall risk of atopy. We successively removed from the model variables by considering the signification of the p-value and information criteria for the model like log-likelihood, deviance, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). We reported the explained heterogeneity (R2) by variables included in models. A variable with P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in the final model. We assessed the influence of confounding factors by conducting a sensitivity study that included only equitably distributed studies for each risk factor between reference cases and controls. For each potential confounding factor, we assessed the distribution between reference cases and controls by recalculating the p values using the exact tests of Fisher and Chi-2. The two p values> 0.05 of Fisher's exact test and Chi-2 indicated a symmetric distribution of the confounding factor between reference cases and controls.",

We excluded a total of 309 articles for multiple reasons including mismatch of the study population (no control group, inclusion of non-viral LRTI and non-LRTI infections, and inclusion of only patients with underlying medical conditions), the type of study not appropriate (case report, comment on study, editorial, and review), lack of data on outcomes, conference abstract or complete texts not found, and irrelevance of the articleSupplementary. We finally included 22 articles (24 studies) in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of this systematic review [29\u201350]. We showed the individual characteristics of the publications included in S3 Table. Most studies were conducted in Europe, detected HRSV, had a low risk of bias, included hospitalized children under 1 year of age with their first episode of bronchiolitis, had followed children between 5\u201310 years old, and were prospective. Children with a history of viral LRTI in childhood were recruited between 1960 and 2014 and articles were published between 1981 and 2017.The individual NOS score from the included studies are presented in S4 Table.",

These findings should encourage research on the long-term burden of viral LRTI in childhood in non-European regions and non-HRSV viruses. Prospective randomized studies including intervention against the development of the LRTI would be ideal to rule out the residual confusion about the causal relationship between infantile LRTIs and the development of subsequent atopy. The imminent arrival of the vaccine against HRSV on the market or the prophylactic means such as palivizumab could be a way to carry out these interventional studies. To reduce the burden of atopy, there a real need of more accurate diagnosis tools and efforts should focus on other major risk factors including genetic predisposition, diet habits, air pollution, family size, and the use of vaccines or antibiotics.",
