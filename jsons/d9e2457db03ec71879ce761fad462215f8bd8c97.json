We selected glycoprotein C (gC) of BoHV-1 as a target to detect and/or verify presence of the virus in suspect materials followed by virus isolation (VI) in MDBK cells. In seven out of 13 BoHV-1 positive samples, cytophatic effects (CPEs) were observed in MDBK cell cultures, although only four virus samples reached a sufficient titer to use in phylogenetic assay, restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), and virus neutralization test (VNT). According to the results of sequence analysis of the 13 BoHV-1 positive samples, nine BoHV-1 field viruses were determined as BoHV-1.1 and four as BoHV-1.2. Using REA, we demonstrated that two of our isolated viruses could be categorized as BoHV-1.1 while the other two isolates were BoHV-1.2 subtypes. Differences between the BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2 isolates were also detected in the VNT results by assaying 125 suspected serum samples after testing with isolated (KY748023, KY748022, KY748020, and KY748021) and reference viruses (BoHV-1 Cooper and BoHV-5 Texas 89). These results are indicating the need to correctly identify BoHV-1 field isolates to better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of infection. In addition, it would be useful to identify the subtypes circulating in the specific geographical area while determining vaccination preferences.",

            "text": "Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), of the Herpesviridae family and Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is distributed worldwide, causing significant economic losses to the cattle industry (Ackermann and Engels 2006) . This virus is the causative agent of various severe conditions in cattle respiratory and genital systems, including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and infectious pustular vulvovaginitis/balanoposthitis (IPV/IBP) (Straub 1990 ). BoHV-1 genome consists of one linear DNA molecule of about 140 kb, which replicates in the upper respiratory or genital tracts and gains access to neurons to establish latency in the corresponding ganglia (Ackermann et al. 1990 ). According to its antigenic and genomic characteristics, BoHV-1 is further subdivided into two distinct yet closely related subtypes: 1 (BoHV-1.1) and 2 (BoHV-1.2) (Metzler et al. 1986 ). Such subtypes may also be associated with distinct manifestations of the disease in cattle (Engels et al.1992) . However, all subtypes are antigenically similar. BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2a are mostly related to the respiratory syndrome and abortions. BoHV-1.2b subtypes, which are considered to be moderately pathogenic (Metzler et al. 1985) , may cause vulvovaginitis/balanopostitis, but have not yet been linked with abortions (Miller et al. 1991 suggested that each genotype is more adapted to either one (Rijsewijk et al. 1999; Spilki et al. 2004) . Previously, because BoHV-5 was reported as BoHV-1.3 and considered to be associated with neurological disorders, including cattle encephalitis, it was named bovine encephalitic herpesvirus (Muylkens et al. 2007 ). BoHV-5 has also been subdivided into a, b, and non-a/b or c (Pidone et al. 1999 ). BoHV-1 genome encodes for 33 structural proteins, with 13 probably associated with the envelope (Liang et al. 1996) , of which 10 have the potential to encode glycoproteins (Schwyzer and Ackermann 1996) . BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2 subtypes differ in glycoprotein C (gC) epitopes, which may alter viral attachment and virulence (Rijsewijk et al. 1999) . Despite close similarities, BoHV-1.1, 1.2, and BoHV-5 can be differentiated by antigenic or molecular analysis of gC (Claus et al. 2005; Silva et al. 2007; Esteves et al. 2008) . BoHV-1 has been eradicated in several European countries, and in addition, control programs based on the use of marker vaccines have been initiated in other European countries, especially those experiencing high seroprevalence. These vaccines allow serological differentiation between naturally infected and vaccinated cattle (Van Oirschot et al. 1997) .",

            "text": "The present study reported the genomic and antigenic characterization of thirteen BoHV-1-positive samples obtained from different clinical cattle cases in Turkey. Seven field strains of BoHV-1 were isolated from three different clinical syndromes (abortion, respiratory disease, and mastitis) between 1992 and 2017 in Ankara, Konya, and Kayseri provinces of Turkey. However, after several rounds of propagation in MDBK cells, only 4 viruses adapted to the cell culture system. The presence and characteristics of the viruses were firstly detected by a PCR and/or VI before confirmation by VNT, PCR/sequence analysis, and REA ). The REA results from this study indicate that four isolates of BoHV-1 were very closely related with some minor differences between them (Fig. 3) . Besides, the restriction patterns in the native isolates were also similar to other BoHV-1 strains described in previous reports (D'Arce et al. 2002; Whetstone et al. 1989 ). Some researchers have reported that there is no direct relationship between clinical patterns and RE profiles (Ros and Belak 1999). Since we only had a few isolated strains in our study, we made no such comparison. The positive gC PCR products of the 7 isolated viruses and 6 positive samples were subjected to sequencing. The consistent alignment revealed high degrees of identity in all herpesviruses analyzed in the present study. The tree constructed based on nucleotide sequences showed a similar topology and the presence of two main groups: one formed by BoHV-1.1 and 1.2, and the other formed by BoHV-5 viruses. Our positive samples could be clearly separated into BoHV-1.1 (n = 9) and BoHV-1.2 (n = 4) by phylogenetic analysis. The present study established the prevalence of BoHV-1.1 as the predominant circulating subtype of BoHV-1 in Turkey. The close genetic and antigenic relationship that we observed between our BoHV-1.1-and 1.2-positive samples was not unexpected. The nucleotide sequence alignments revealed levels of genomic similarity ranging from 99.07 to 100% among our BoHV-1 field viruses (n = 13), and 89.71 to 90.65% between BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 (Table 2) . Our BoHV-1.2 strains showed more than 98% sequence identity with BoHV-1.1 strains, indicating the possibility of very little genomic differences between these two BoHV-1subtypes. Based on gC sequencing, the nucleotide sequence differences between these subtypes lie at position of 252, with the A nucleotide of BoHV-1.1 substituted with G in BoHV-1.2 strains. The present study detected BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2 from similar clinical cases to those found by previous researchers, such as upper respiratory disease, mastitis, and abortion in cattle. We also found no relationship between BoHV-1 subtypes and clinical presentations (d 'Offay et al. 2016; Esteves et al. 2008; Fulton et al. 2015) . Thus, our findings indicate the need to correctly identify BoHV-1 field isolates to better understand their epidemiology and pathogenesis, and to develop a better strategy for vaccine development.",

            "text": "In our study, like several previous ones (Varela et al. 2010; Holz et al. 2009 ), differences between BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2 strains were detected by VNT. This may be related to the predominant strain that causes infection in cattle populations. Accordingly, methods involving two subtypes in the diagnostic assays may eliminate false negative results. On the other hand, this test did not allow type-specific differentiation between the neutralizing antibody responses against BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 in most samples, as reported before (Varela et al. 2010 ), except one sample (sample no. 24) which was detected positive only for BoHV-5 (Table 3) . Regarding VNT, out of 39 antibodypositive serum samples, 33 (33/39; 84.61%) reacted with all viruses (BoHV-1.1, 1.2 subtypes and 5) ( Table 3 ). In addition, among the positive samples, only 2 (2/39; 5.1%) specimens were positive for BoHV-1.1 but negative for BoHV-1.2, while three samples (3/39; 7.69%) were positive for BoHV-1.2 strains but negative for BoHV-1.1 strains (Tables 3, 4, and 5). According to these results, when the test was performed with BoHV-1.1 strains, four samples (4/39; 10.2%) were detected as negative (Tables 3  and 4 ). Comparing the results obtained with the same subtype showed similar results. We found that if only one of the six viruses (four field isolates, BoHV-1 Cooper, and BoHV-5 Texas strains) were included in the assay, the results could give a 10.2% miss rate of the neutralizing antibody of the positive serum samples (Table 3) . Similarly, Holz et al. (2009) reported that it is possible to miss at least 23.6% of all neutralizing antibody-positive serum samples. Cross-neutralization studies using serum samples from naturally infected animals failed to differentiate BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2, reflecting these subtypes' high degree of structural/antigenic similarity. However, we believe that serological results may vary depending on the subtypes. Varela et al. (2010) reported that the sensitivity of SN 50 to a single virus, regardless of their types/subtypes, varied between 77 and 91% giving rise to significantly low sensitivity. Even with viruses belonging to a same subtype, for example, the two BoHV-1.1 strains, sensitivity varied from 86 to 91%. Thus, low sensitivity may comprise the use of VNT to support control or eradication strategies. These results also suggest that type or subtype may have little meaning in terms of antigenic relatedness among such viruses (Varela et al. 2010) . Previous studies have been unable to achieve type-differentiation using VNT because antibody titers did not differ significantly (equal to or greater than fourfold) in about 92% of serum samples (Teixeira et al. 2001) . Therefore, type-specific tests still wait for further development to overcome this obstacle. In addition, cattle may also be infected with more than one virus types/subtypes, as recently demonstrated ). However, using many distinct viruses in VNT is not practical and difficult to perform in diagnostic laboratories. We also found that both BoHV-1.1 (KY748020) and 1.2a (KY748022) subtypes were circulating simultaneously in the same herd (Ankara 1). As both virus types and most subtypes may circulate in herds, the choice of a challenge virus may significantly influence the test's sensitivity.",

Besides, there have been no studies on the molecular characterization of Turkish BoHV-1 strains. Thus, the present study reported the isolation, antigenic/molecular characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of different bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) strains from naturally infected cattle with distinct clinical signs. These findings are helpful for comparing old and new virus strains to determine which strains can be used in future vaccination programs. Further studies on molecular and antigenic characterization using field isolates from different clinical signs will help achieve a better understanding of the virus's epidemiology in order to develop more effective vaccines and diagnostic assays.
