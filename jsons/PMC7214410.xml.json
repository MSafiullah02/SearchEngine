Degradation of specific proteins is critical for countless cellular functions and begins with the covalent modification of substrate proteins with ubiquitin. Substrate attachment occurs between the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal glycine and a substrate residue (typically lysine). Ubiquitin itself bears seven lysine residues that can be ubiquitylated, in addition to its N-terminal \u03b1-amino group, leading to the formation of various ubiquitin polymers1. Two of the most common polymers are linked through the K48 or K63 residues of ubiquitin. K48 poly-ubiquitin-chain attachment frequently leads to degradation of the substrate by the proteasome, while K63 poly-ubiquitin chains are known signals for autophagy, intracellular membrane protein trafficking, and DNA repair2\u20134.",

Besides the predicted structure of the Ulp1-like domain, we characterize a unique ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) in OtDUB with highly unusual properties. The UBD alters the substrate preferences of the DUB domain, and provides one of three closely positioned ubiquitin-binding sites in OtDUB. Notably, ubiquitin binding induces a transition in the UBD from a poorly folded to well-ordered state; despite this entropic cost, the UBD has an exceptionally high affinity for mono-ubiquitin. DUB and UBD activities are conserved in the related pathogen O. chuto. Our data reveal an unusual mechanism for ubiquitin-chain selectivity by DUBs and a remarkably high ubiquitin-binding affinity for a UBD, which can be exploited for protein ubiquitylation analyses. Characterization of the structure and enzymatic activity of OtDUB also makes the protein an attractive drug target in the treatment of scrub typhus.",

Within this group of proteases, there are typically three variable regions (VRs) and one constant region (CR) that together account for the S1 substrate-binding interface, which contacts the distal ubiquitin11. (In a di-ubiquitin unit, the proximal ubiquitin contributes the lysine to the ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkage, while the distal ubiquitin provides the C-terminal carboxylate group of Gly76.) OtDUB lacks an N-terminal VR-1; instead, the C-terminal accessory domain (residues 170\u2013259) protrudes into the VR-1 position via an extended \u03b1-helical arm positioned close to the catalytic site, suggesting that it assists in substrate binding (Fig. 1a, c). The C-terminal region of the protein fragment, residues 260\u2013311, was apparently disordered and not observed in the structure.",

To analyze the structural basis of the substrate preferences of OtDUB, we assembled a complex of OtDUB1\u2013259 with free ubiquitin and determined the crystal structure of the complex at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. Three ubiquitin molecules bound to each OtDUB fragment (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). One ubiquitin is bound to the active site (UbS1, gray) and represents the distal ubiquitin that would remain after cleavage of the proximal ubiquitin at the S1\u2032 site (absent from the structure, Fig. 2b). The position of UbS1 in the OtDUB complex is rotated nearly 90\u00b0 relative to the position of UbS1 in complexes with XopD and SdeA (Fig. 2c). Overall, UbS1 binding to OtDUB buries an extensive interface of nearly 1200 \u00c52, and results in modest conformational changes in OtDUB (overall RMSD < 1.5 \u00c5) attributable mostly to a slight (~10\u00b0) rotation of VR-1 towards UbS1. We also observed the density for two additional ubiquitin molecules: one bound to the side of the OtDUB that we propose represents the S2 site (pink, Fig. 2), and a third ubiquitin molecule (yellow) bound to the backside of VR-1 far from the active site, which likely represents the biochemically identified UBD (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1c).",

By contrast, the F59T mutation significantly decreased the percentage of K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin cleaved, but caused only small decreases in activity against K48-linked poly-ubiquitin at early time points. These data bolster the assertion that the ubiquitin bound to the side of VR-2 (the S2 site) represents the most distally bound ubiquitin in a K63-linked chain (n \u2265 3) and provide a structural explanation for how extended K63-linked ubiquitin chains are accommodated in the OtDUB structure.

The UbS1 itself is sandwiched between two OtDUB regions: on one side it contacts VR-2, which creates a hydrophobic pocket (OtDUB I36/V39/L46/T50) for G47 of ubiquitin, and on the other, VR-1 uses charged residues (OtDUB R196/E238/R242) to interact with oppositely charged residues of ubiquitin, a noncanonical ubiquitin surface for S1 site interactions (Fig. 4a, right panel). In contrast to its structural compatibility with binding K63 di-ubiquitin chains (Fig. 2b), when UbS1 is aligned with the proximal ubiquitin in K48 di-ubiquitin from published K48-chain structures, the distal ubiquitin clashes with the DUB domain (Supplementary Fig. 4a).

To test if VR-1 affects cleavage specificity, we mutated its ubiquitin-interacting residues (R196A/E238A and E238A/R242A double mutants; Fig. 4a) and analyzed the mutants in cleavage assays with K48- and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin (Fig. 4b). Both OtDUB double mutants inhibited K48-chain cleavage, showing a significant impairment by 10 min (Fig. 4c). By contrast, cleavage of K63-linked chains was not affected. Analysis of these mutations with Ub-AMC also revealed a slight decrease in enzyme activity (Fig. 4d), but the E238A/R242A mutant had no significant effect on K63 or K48 di-ubiquitin cleavage (Fig. 4e, f). These data show that the noncanonical VR-1 is required for full DUB activity against extended chains and suggest that ubiquitin binding at the K63-chain-favoring S2 site can override impaired binding to the S1 site by long K63 chains but not K48 chains.",

When we examined the electrostatic interactions at this interface, we also found evidence for strong interactions. Charge-neutralizing mutations (D204A/D208A and N222A/D226A) did not reduce binding to ubiquitin, and even charge reversals could not fully disrupt binding (Fig. 5d).

Unexpectedly, 2D-NMR analysis of the UBD170\u2013264 alone revealed a broad and ill-defined backbone spectrum, suggestive of conformation heterogeneity and disorder (Fig. 5f). When ubiquitin was titrated in at equimolar amounts, the spectrum originally characterized by broadened, low-intensity resonances shifted to a dispersed and well-resolved spectrum containing many new resonance peaks, characteristic of a fully folded structure. A substantial structural transition of the UBD was supported by the apo-DUB-UBD1\u2013311 crystal structure (Fig. 1a), which lacked density for residues 224\u2013235 at the beginning of the UBD, a region that includes the ubiquitin-interacting residues D226 and K230. These data are also consistent with the large, negative \u2206S calculated from ITC measurements for the binding reaction between UBD and ubiquitin (Table 1), indicating a large reduction in entropy upon binding.

Human SUMO2 did not bind the UBD or the DUB domain of OtDUB based on SEC analysis with OtDUB1\u2013311 (Supplementary Fig. 5d)45.

We therefore tested for effects on OtDUB DUB activity. K48 di-ubiquitin was cleaved faster by the OtDUB1\u2013259-V203D mutant, a variant that abolishes UBD-UbUBD binding (Fig. 5b) and was indifferent to ubiquitin preincubation (Fig. 6a, b). When WT OtDUB1\u2013259 was preincubated with ubiquitin, it cleaved K48 di-ubiquitin faster than the V203D mutant (Fig. 6a, b). These results suggest the UBD sequesters K48 di-ubiquitin away from the active site, an effect that is blocked by pre-binding the UBD with ubiquitin. The higher activity of WT OtDUB1\u2013259 toward K48 di-ubiquitin when preincubated with ubiquitin is likely due to VR-1 fully folding when the UBD is occupied (Fig. 5f), while only partially folding in the context of V203D. To test directly the contribution of ubiquitin binding to the S1 site surface from VR-1, WT OtDUB1\u2013259 and the E238A/R242A derivative were incubated with ubiquitin prior to K48 di-ubiquitin cleavage.

The exact reason for this was unclear. When the V203D variant was assayed for Ub-AMC cleavage, we also see a reduced activity compared to OtDUB1\u2013259; the activity was identical to that of OtDUB1\u2013177, which lacks the UBD altogether (see Fig. 6f). This reduced activity between OtDUB1\u2013177 and OtDUB1\u2013259 was also observed for di-ubiquitin cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Together, these results suggest that a fully intact S1 site is required for optimal K63 di-ubiquitin cleavage and Ub-AMC cleavage, although the mechanistic details remain to be fully explained.",

To test this, we analyzed the ability of the S2 site mutant OtDUB1\u2013259-F59T to cleave K63 di-ubiquitin. As predicted, the F59T mutant cleaved K63 di-ubiquitin significantly faster than WT (Fig. 6e, g). Preincubation with ubiquitin further accelerated K63 di-ubiquitin cleavage by F59T, which could be explained by either a fully intact S1 site or reduced substrate competition with the UBD. No differences were seen with K48 di-ubiquitin cleavage by F59T (Fig. 6e, Supplementary Fig. 6c).",

Similarly, OcDUB1\u2013299 cleaved K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin at a faster rate than OtDUB (Fig. 7d). However, compared to OtDUB, the OcDUB1\u2013299 cleaved extended K48 chains less efficiently (build-up of tri-ubiquitin), and OcDUB1\u2013177 was less efficient at cleaving both K48 and K63 tetra-ubiquitin chains (Fig. 7d).

The two protein fragments were incubated with increasing molar equivalents of ubiquitin. The mixtures were fractionated by SEC (Supplementary Fig. 7a), and equivalent fractions resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 7f). OtDUB1\u2013177-C135A could bind two ubiquitins based on the progressive shift of the DUB protein from the D column fractions to the earlier (larger protein-containing) A and B fractions as ubiquitin levels were increased. OcDUB1\u2013177-C134A, on the other hand, maintained a comparable elution pattern across the titration from 1.0 to 2.5 ubiquitin equivalents and never migrated to fraction A, suggesting the absence of a second (S2) site. When the S2 site mutation F59T is introduced (OtDUB1\u2013177-F59T,C135A) the elution pattern mirrors OcDUB1\u2013177-C134A, suggesting that F59T alone is sufficient to disrupt the S2 site of OtDUB (Fig. 7f). Lack of an S2 site alone does not explain the differences between OtDUB and OcDUB, especially the efficient cleavage of K63 tetra-ubiquitin down to mono-ubiquitin. Additional work will be required to determine the basis of the different enzymatic properties of these related proteins.",

The ability to cleave both chain types can be rationalized by our structural and mutagenesis results. Binding of K63 chains at the S2 site found in VR-2 helps position such chains for cleavage. Cleavage of both K48 and K63 chains appears to depend on contacts made with the S1 site in the noncanonical VR-1, but only K48-chain cleavage is impaired by mutating this surface; this is likely because K48 chains cannot bind optimally at the S2 site, in contrast to K63 chains. When various K48 di-ubiquitin crystal structures are aligned with OtDUB UbS1, there are clashes between the DUB and the distal ubiquitins (Supplementary Fig. 4a). However, the flexibility of the ubiquitin C-terminal segment allows the distal ubiquitin in a K48-type chain to adopt many conformations; indeed, two known conformations of a K48 ubiquitin dimer bound to an enzyme46,47 can be readily modeled into the S1 site with minimal clash at VR-2 of OtDUB (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This suggests the OtDUB utilizes K48-chain flexibility in order to efficiently cleave such chains, as we observed.",

Our approach of co-crystallization with free ubiquitin revealed two additional binding sites\u2014S2 and the UBD\u2014that allow additional insights into DUB specificity and ubiquitin binding. The SARS virus DUB, PLpro, cleaves K48-poly-ubiquitin down to di-ubiquitin and also binds the I44 patch of UbS2 by utilizing a central Phe residue among other hydrophobic residues42. The biological relevance of stalling long-chain cleavage at di-ubiquitin\u2014without further cleavage to mono-ubiquitin\u2014warrants further investigation and may reflect a chain editing function of these DUBs.",

Other bacterial DUBs, such as XopD and SseL, also encode UBDs, but in the form of a low-complexity region and a VHS domain, respectively11. Unlike these CE-clan proteases, the OtDUB VR harbors two separate ubiquitin-binding interfaces, both of which have been captured structurally. Interestingly, OtDUBUBD:ubiquitin interaction strongly promotes DUB activity at high OtDUB concentrations. Saturation of the UBD with free ubiquitin both reduces competition for ubiquitylated substrates at the DUB active site and enhances S1 site formation by promoting folding of VR-1/UBD, which increases K48-chain recognition. Local subcellular concentrations of OtDUB during Orientia infection are not yet known, so it is unclear how relevant this is during infection. The high cytoplasmic levels of free ubiquitin may guarantee a fully activated DUB.",

Although the ubiquitin surface area buried by the bound OtDUBUBD (~17% of the ubiquitin surface) is virtually identical to that of one of the tightest UBDs with an available crystal structure, the CUE domain of Vps9, the binding affinity of the OtDUBUBD for ubiquitin is more than three orders of magnitude tighter49. Other properties of OtDUBUBD must therefore account for its tight association with ubiquitin. The OtDUBUBD utilizes a central hydrophobic interaction surface that contacts all three hydrophobic residues in the canonical Ile44 patch of ubiquitin44 and is further stabilized by complementary electrostatic interactions surrounding the hydrophobic patch38. Shape complementarity (Sc)50 may also help explain the tight affinity for ubiquitin. The calculated Sc value (obtained in CCP4) of the OtDUBUBD:ubiquitin interface shows it to be one of the most complementary (0.65) interfaces among known UBDs; it is surpassed only by two other UBDs crystallized with ubiquitin, Rabex5 (0.69) and the Cbl-b UBA domain (0.72)51,52. While no single one of the aforementioned factors alone is sufficient, the combination of these and possibly other determinants may account for the exceptional affinity of the OtDUBUBD for ubiquitin, despite the entropic cost of UBD folding upon ubiquitin binding.",

This UBD is structurally dynamic on its own, but folds into a unique structure in the presence of ubiquitin. The co-crystal structure of the DUB-UBD segment with ubiquitin revealed multiple ubiquitin-binding sites that can rationalize the specificity of the enzyme for longer ubiquitin chains and the high affinity of the UBD for ubiquitin. These characteristics are conserved in the O. chuto homolog, suggesting that this protein is critical for pathogenicity. These results both advance the range of effector proteins in these understudied pathogens that can be used for drug targeting and expand our understanding of the repertoire of ubiquitin binding and DUB mechanisms utilized in host\u2013pathogen interactions.",

Initially, no solution was found by PHASER; therefore, the apo model was split into two domains: the DUB (1\u2013169) and VR-1/UBD (171\u2013259), and an initial solution was found with two copies of each fragment per asymmetric unit (asu). Using the modified OtDUB1\u2013259 model with domain conformations from the initial search, two additional copies of OtDUB1\u2013259 were found within the asu. The initial model was first improved with several rounds of restrained refinement in Refmac559, and additional rounds of molecular replacement were attempted with human ubiquitin (PDB ID: 1UBQ) as the search model. Unexpectedly, PHASER was unable to find any copies of ubiquitin within the unit cell despite extensive difference density and readily identifiable secondary structure. Therefore, individual molecules of ubiquitin were manually docked into the electron density in Coot, and iterative rounds of restrained refinement improved phases such that sidechain density for all three unique molecules of ubiquitin emerged. In total, four molecules of the OtDUB fragment and 12 molecules of ubiquitin were placed within the asu. The model was rebuilt in Coot according to the 2Fo\u2013Fc map, followed by iterative rounds of restrained, translation/libration/screw and twin refinement, with twin operator (\u2212h, \u2212k, \u2212l) and twin fraction \u03b1 = 0.26. Evaluation of the Ramachandran plot gave 97.9% in favored, 2.0% in allowed, and 0.1% in outlier regions. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2.",
