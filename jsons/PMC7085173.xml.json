Access to the RedCap data will be limited to the principal investigators and co-investigators involved in data collection only. Access to REDCap requires authentication (username and password) for secure maintenance of the data. All investigators are KFSH&RC employees and have access to the electronic medical record (Power Chart). All collected information will be stored in a secure manner, and all patient data will be kept confidential. To ensure consistency in data collection, training sessions will be held by the principal investigators for all research co-investigators involved in data collection prior to study commencement. Additionally, the principal investigators will conduct educational sessions for ICU physicians and ICU nurses, which will include the study protocol, and periodic follow-up educational sessions to provide feedback and ensure optimal compliance with the study protocol. There will be periodic internal audits of data entry accuracy and compliance by the principal investigators. This will allow us to identify any protocol deviations and provide an opportunity for feedback to the co-investigators involved in data entry. Range edits and value checks will be incorporated into the REDCap software to minimize the potential for data entry errors.

Moreover, we will collect ICU type, baseline analgesics, sedatives, vasopressor requirements, and PRE-DELIRIC Delirium Risk Score, which is a delirium prediction model specifically designed for adult critical care patients 24 h after ICU admission. This model will be used to predict the factors that may influence delirium risk prior to randomization [25]. We will also collect RASS, pain, and CAM-ICU scores at baseline and at 24 and 48 h post-randomization. The RASS is a scale used to assess the depth of sedation on a scale of \u2212 5 to + 4, with a negative value indicating deeper sedation and positive values indicating increased agitation [1]. The CAM-ICU is a valid and reliable delirium assessment tool. Patients with a RASS score of \u2212 3 or lower will be excluded from CAM-ICU assessment, as they cannot participate in the exam [26]. We will calculate the modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) to differentiate secretions caused by patients\u2019 underlying lung pathology (ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) vs ketamine-associated hypersalivation [27].

Here the times are distributed with lognormal distributions, and the respective IQRs are 0.58\u20132.66 for ketamine-treated patients and 1.60\u20134.00 for those not treated with ketamine. A simulation analysis was carried out with 35 simulated patient times under each of the above two distributional scenarios, i.e., 35 intubation to extubation times under a lognormal of 1.44 and 0.58\u20132.66 (median and IQR) and 35 intubation to extubation times under a lognormal of 2.44 and 1.60\u20134.00 (median and IQR). This was followed by calculation of the level of significance by the Wilcoxon rank sum test (i.e., the associated P value). By repeating this simulation 10,000 times, 80.24% of the simulations had a P value less than 0.05. This shows that the power of a design with 35 ketamine-treated and 35 non-ketamine-treated patients should (with at least 80% probability) demonstrate that the time from intubation to extubation is one day less for those treated with ketamine. It is recognized that non-compliance and dropouts may occur. Hence, the study has been designed to recruit 40 ketamine-treated and 40 untreated subjects for analyses (i.e., total sample size 80). The median ventilator-free days will be calculated as calendar days with no ventilator support to day 28 post-randomization. Participants who die before day 28 are assigned zero free days. Data will be analyzed using the modified intention-to-treat principle and will comprise data from all patients who undergo randomization, with the exception of those who withdraw consent, have an unknown primary outcome, or are identified as ineligible after randomization. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality will be used to assess the distribution of all outcome variables. Chi-square and t tests (or Wilcoxon rank sum) will be used to compare categorical data and continuous data, respectively. All data will be presented as median and IQR, if not normally distributed (or count and percentages, if categorical). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses will be used to identify risk factors and predictors for delirium. Statistically significant factors in the univariate analysis (\u2264 0.05) will be included in the multivariate analysis. Adjustments for the analysis will be accounted for with the Bonferroni technique. A prespecified sub-group analysis of the primary outcome will be conducted on the following variables:\nAge > 60 vs age < 60SOFA score > 10 vs < 10APACHE II > 20 vs < 20Ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PF ratio > 150 vs PF ratio < 150)Surgical vs medical admission.",

Consultants with special expertise might be invited to assist from time to time with complex issues. The committee will undertake periodic reviews at the discretion of the Chair, and an expedited review is done for all serious unexpected adverse events (SUAEs), including death. The committee has the authority to suspend or halt recruitment if necessary. Refer to Supplementary File 2 for the form used to report SUAEs and death by the study investigators within 48 h of occurrence. All death cases reviewed so far have been due to the underlying disease, with participation in the trial not being a contributing factor. Any clinically significant worsening in a study participant\u2019s condition based on clinical judgement compared to the baseline status at the time of randomization will be recorded as an AE in our progress report to be sent to the RAC by 4 June 2020 (the date specified originally upon IRB approval of the study protocol). This is applied whether or not the AE is considered to be related to the study treatment. In addition, this study is registered at the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (FDA), which provides independent input regarding the safety of interventions. Since this is an investigator-initiated, single-center, pilot, feasibility trial, periodic reviews are basically focused on monitoring safety. No formal interim analysis of efficacy will be undertaken due to possible small numbers that might preclude determination of a statistically significant difference in outcomes between the arms. No stopping rules or external independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) are specified. We believe the administration of sedative agents is standard of practice in the ICU to minimize a patient\u2019s discomfort while on MV (see Supplementary Figure 1: KFSH&RC new sedation protocol for adult ICUs). Hence, the expected adverse effects will not exceed what is encountered during daily practice (e.g., benzodiazepine-associated delirium, opioid-induced constipation, hemodynamic instability associated with propofol and dexmedetomidine, ketamine-associated sympathetic stimulation \u201c tachycardia and increase in blood pressure,\u201d and possible delirium).

It is conducted in a mixed ICU cohort (medical, surgical, transplant, and oncology ICU settings), focused on patient-centered outcomes as a primary outcome (duration of MV), and addresses the fact that most patients in the ICU are sedated with a combination of drugs. Randomization, blinded study participants and study statistician, and adherence to the modified intention-to-treat principle will limit potential sources of bias. Another strength of this pilot study is the narrow randomization window (within 24 h post-intubation), which was chosen based on prior literature that showed early initiation of an intervention increases the ability of the intervention to influence the outcome, be more informative for clinicians, and have a greater power to detect an effect on important outcomes, such as duration of mechanical ventilation and long-term outcomes [16\u201318]. Moreover, we elected to record the vasopressor requirements, cumulative sedatives and analgesics, number of patients within RASS and pain score goals, and delirium incidence 48 h post-randomization to avoid the presence of confounders if measured > 48 h after ketamine infusion, similar to the study by Groetzinger et al.

Various dosing regimens of ketamine continuous infusion for sedation are described in the literature. A recent systematic review described the existing data regarding ketamine dosing for adjunct sedation in small cohorts of primarily neurologically injured patients [12]. The included studies describe dosing regimens up to 103.3 \u03bc g/kg/min (6.2 mg/kg/h), which is substantially higher than the doses prescribed in our cohort. As most patients in the review had a neurological injury, sedatives were administered to maintain deep sedation, and often with background benzodiazepine infusion or even barbiturate anesthesia [12]. On the other hand, Groetzinger and colleagues used continuous infusion ketamine for adjunct sedation in a population of mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults targeting light sedation; ketamine was infused at a median starting dose of 1.6\u20134.2 \u03bc g/kg/min (0.1\u20130.25 mg/kg/h) for a median of 2.8 days. The maximum doses of ketamine in individual patients experiencing adverse drug reactions (such as tachyarrhythmia) ranged from 2.08\u201320 \u03bc g/kg/min (0.125 to 1.2 mg/kg/h), necessitating discontinuation of the infusion [11].",

Therefore, the ICU treating team and the study investigators will know to which arm the study participants are randomized. Moreover, we will not collect data on other pain medications such as morphine and hydromorphone, as those medications are rarely used, per the KFSH&RC adult sedation protocol, compared to fentanyl. Another limitation is exclusion of patients in status asthmaticus or status epilepticus and patients placed on ECMO, as the dosing regimen of ketamine in those conditions is different than the regimen we used herein as an adjunct analgo-sedative agent. This may limit the external validity of this trial, although the population described in our cohort is relevant to many critically ill patients. Since we were interested in describing ketamine infusions as part of a light sedation strategy, we have excluded patients for whom the RASS goal is \u2212 5, such as those receiving continuous infusion neuromuscular blockade.

Future trials addressing cardiac assessment and hemodynamic metrics in a more protocolized way would be a great addition. For example, studies could assess metrics such as measurement of cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), and stroke volume variation (SVV) estimated by arterial pulse pressure waveform analysis (e.g., with the Vigileo monitor) at baseline (prerandomization) and at 24 and 48 h afterward (post-randomization), considering other potential confounders and adjunct interventions to evaluate whether these findings are direct consequences of ketamine or independent changes related to the severity of critical illness and the cumulative effect of adjunct interventions (i.e., antimicrobials, steroids, fluid administration, and blood products). Lastly, it would be optimal to assess some patient-reported outcomes for those who developed an emergence reaction or delirium. The active engagement of patients and family members has been highlighted recently in the ICU literature, and this would be a great addition to consider in a future multicenter trial through completing an ICU diary or a survey 28 days post-ICU discharge among ICU survivors [31].",
