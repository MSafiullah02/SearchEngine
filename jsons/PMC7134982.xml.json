However, such atypical presentations of SARS have mostly been reported in patients with congestive heart failure, compromised immunity, and the elderly.1., 2. From April 3 to May 12, 2003, there were 2,765 patients (including 602 patients with exposure risk) who presented to our emergency department (ED) for SARS screening without documented fever. Even without fever, they were admitted as long as there were infiltrates on chest radiography. Only 3 of them were finally confirmed to have SARS. All 3 patients were elderly with comorbidities such as heart failure or compromised immunity.",

It has been proposed that SARS\u2013coronavirus pneumonia is largely an immunologically mediated process.3., 5. Patients with normal immunity, in our experience, may have pulmonary infiltrates preceding respiratory symptoms, but rarely before signs of systemic inflammation.5 However, there are 2 caveats that should be addressed. First, 40.5% (32/79) of SARS patients documented fever at home but not on arrival to the ED, as a result of the intermittent fever curve induced by SARS infection. Second, fever may be the only initial presentation of SARS. Of our SARS patients, 13.9% (11/79) reported fever as the only symptom in the ED, yet 9 of them had radiographic infiltrates. Were it not for the practice of regularly checking body temperature, they might be regarded as cases \u201cwith radiographic evidence of pneumonia preceding the fever.\u201d Thus, from our experience, we believe that routinely measuring body temperature provides an important step in the early detection and screening of potential SARS infection.",
