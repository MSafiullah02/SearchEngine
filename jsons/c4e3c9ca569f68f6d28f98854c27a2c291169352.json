Compared with existing reverse docking platforms43,44 , the D3Targets-2019-nCoV webserver is specifically focused on COVID-19, including not only the experimental structures and homology models, but also the conformations with potential allosteric binding sites predicted by enhanced sampling method (vsREMD)21 and D3Pockets 20 , respectively. The abundant conformations and binding pockets make the webserver much possible to successfully predict target proteins and to discover hit compounds. It is also important to notice that other reverse docking platforms should be tried as the true targets of an active compound may not be included in D3Targets-2019-nCoV due to the unknown pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19. Because the protein conformation obtained by homology modelling may not be the most stable conformation, and some docking models still need further optimization, for example, the positions of two Mg 2+ on the RdRp, the workflow of D3Targets-2019-nCoV needs to be further improved.In order to keep the D3Targets-2019-nCoV server fresh and active, we will continue to update the webserver in the future. To make better use of the docking platform, some applications are listed as follows: (1) target prediction of multi-target drugs; (2) target prediction of old drugs and novel active compounds; (3) virtual screening of drugs for specified targets; (4) prediction of binding modes of drugs to known targets, and (5) users can download protein models for free from the webserver for molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking or structure-activity relationship studies, etc. In particular, predicting target based only on the highest docking score may not be reliable. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the users take into account the docked binding mode and docking scores together with protein function.
