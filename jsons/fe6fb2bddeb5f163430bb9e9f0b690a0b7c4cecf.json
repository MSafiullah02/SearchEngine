            "text": "The outbreak of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV2] officially named SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is rapidly spreading worldwide. 1 This is the third serious coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012, 2 and the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus in history. The outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in China, but it has rapidly spread to other Asian countries and, since February 2020, to Italy and Europe, with increasing incidence in all European countries, and now in all continents. Currently [as of March 14, 2020] , more than 150 000 confirmed cases worldwide are reported by the SARS-CoV2, with more than 5000 COVID-19-related deaths. 3 Currently, Italy is the most affected country in Europe [more than 20 000 cases], accounting for 55% of confirmed cases requiring hospitalisation for COVID-19, 10% of patients being admitted to intensive care units, and 8% mortality. 3 Compared with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 appears to be less fatal but more contagious. 4 The virus shares 87.1% of its genome with the SARS-CoV, and is able to use all ACE2 proteins, except for mouse ACE2, as an entry receptor to enter ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells that do not express this receptor. The SARS-CoV2 does not use other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N [APN] and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP4]. 5 The main route of contamination appears to be by small virus-laden droplets displaced by airflows. However, there is increasing evidence that ACE2 protein, which has been proven to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, supporting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. 6 The continuous positive detection of the viral RNA from faeces suggests that the infectious virions are secreted from the virusinfected gastrointestinal cells, 6 and therefore the faecal-oral route should be considered. 7, 8 Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between January 4, 2020 and February 24, 2020 from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China, estimates that the median incubation period is 5.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% develops symptoms within 11.5 days [CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days] of infection. Under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases [99th percentile, 482] will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. 9 The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infection, are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalised myalgia, malaise, drowsiness, diarrhoea, confusion, dyspnoea, and bilateral interstitial pneumonia. 4 COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progress to or co-exist with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. 10 At the moment, infection by SARS-CoV2 is diagnosed by a SARS-CoV2 nucleic acid amplification test from an oropharyngeal swab; however, the combination of amplification test and CT may improve the diagnosis of COVID-19, 10,11 as 19% of patients can have lung involvement with no symptoms, 10 and amplification tests on biological samples might be negative in almost 50% of patients with infection. 11 Moreover, patients may have viral RNA present in faeces and, at smaller rate, in urine for 2-10 days after the oropharyngeal swab returns to negative. 6, 12 A small study 13 on 29 patients with different grades of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia showed clinical characteristics of common viral pneumonias. In this study, there were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor [IL-2R] and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups [p <0.05], among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mild group. No statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1], IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count, and LDH were found among the three groups [p >0.05]. Low CD4 + T cells in blood are associated with longer virus clearance time and more severe course of the disease, resulting in a longer time when the virus may be present in stools during the rehabilitation phase. 12 ",

Since the outbreak has started, our hospital has been massively involved in the management of COVID-19 patients, requiring many clinicians to be reassigned to dedicated COVID-19 infected inpatients. The overload of hospitalisations and the distraction of doctors and nurses to this emergency situation, together with the limitations in travel even within the same area, has led to the need of a rapid change in the management of IBD patients at any level. IBD patients are severely worried about the impact of their disease and medications on the risk and the prognosis of COVID-19, and many of them are forced to come to hospital because of active disease, complications and drug administration. In order to maintain the quality standard of care, 16 our unit has adopted several strategies [ Figure 1 ].",

Thiopurines and JAK inhibitors can decrease the number of activated T-cells; however, we are not advising to stop these treatments in patients in remission with these agents, who strictly follow the preventive recommendations. Since there are no data in for or against monoclonal antibodies [although antiIL-6 agents appear to be promising for COVID-19 pneumonia 20 ], patients continue their treatment; but we are postponing the start of new therapies if the patients has no symptoms [i.e., prevention of postoperative recurrence in patients with low-moderate risk of recurrence].",
