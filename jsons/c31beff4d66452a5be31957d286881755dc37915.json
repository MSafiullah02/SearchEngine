Yet, public health response is currently based on thin evidence. Biomedical and epidemiological understanding of COVID-19 remains limited, while basic tools such as approved therapeutics or vaccines are still missing (Herper, 2020) . As a result, in the societal safety domain proposed measures are draconian and are aimed towards suppressing the pandemic wave by limiting human interaction, through social distancing (Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020) . Based on the approaches adopted so far, we propose health authorities to consider the following interventions:",

Sero-prevalence studies Currently, most countries use PCR-based testing for cases that fulfil the criteria of a case definition adopted by the national public health authority. Echoing the clear plea of WHO for more testing, many countries strive to substantially increase their testing capacities towards mass testing. Mass testing undoubtedly favours timely isolation of infected patients and flattening of the epidemic curve, though its feasibility, particularly for weaker health systems, is questionable (WHO, 2020) . In addition to the above, as the number of countries affected by the pandemic rises dramatically, the demand for tests will probably surpass the supply in the very near future (Kuznia et al, 2020) .",

Thus, while the focus of response planning falls on hospitals and ICUs, as they clearly need to be prepared for an unprecedented number of critically ill patients being admitted in the upcoming weeks, it should be stressed that responsiveness of the PHC will be key in order to keep the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the health of the general population as low as possible. The PHC sector may not only function as an effective breakwater for hospitals, keeping mild cases at home, but can also contribute to epidemiological surveillance and health information dissemination. Taking into consideration the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, mistrust and sense of injustice over access to health services is becoming a common pattern in most of the countries affected. Therefore, the reinforcement of social cohesion needs to pass by the promotion and the realization of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work with a specific focus on public health measures (ILO, 2020a; ILO, 2020b) .",

Inmates, refugees and migrants residing in camps, homeless, minorities and socially marginalized population groups are in dire need of tailored public health interventions and swift health policy action. From a safety perspective, migrants -in particular -have always been a special category under investigation (Garcia -Arroyo and Segovia, 2020; D\u00f6\u00f6s, 1994; Guldenmund et al, 2013) . A sense of not being part of the national security system (Hoyland, 2018), limited knowledge of national OSH policies and provisions, negligence on the part of employees and insufficient knowledge of their rights are reported in literature as limiting factors; from a pandemic perspective this can have a detrimental effect on their communities, hence particular attention should be paid.",
