Coulter (\u2018sweet fern\u2019).1 This plant has been used traditionally for its antimicrobial and other biological properties by a number of native North American cultures of the Great Lakes and Maritime regions.2 Although the cytoxic compound, methyl-p-coumarate had previously been found in this plant,3 along with numerous other compounds isolated from the essential oil,4 stilbene 1 had not previously been reported to be present in C. peregrina. Interestingly, compound 1 was identified in the plants, Didymochlaena truncatala (Sw.) J. Sm (Dryopteridaceae)5 and Alpinia katsumadai Hayata.6 However, the antimicrobial properties of this natural stilbene 1 were not reported in either of the prior studies.",

Furthermore, natural product 1 was found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of Mycobacterium bovis with an MIC of 26 \u03bcg/mL, which indicated it might serve as a promising lead scaffold in the development of drugs used to combat drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.",

Importantly, the phenolic 2- and 3-styrylthiophenes 8 and 9, respectively, were produced efficiently using this one-pot process.27 Thus, coupling between the TBDPS-protected arylvinyl iodide 7 and the thiophenyl zinc reagent, followed by deprotection using TBAF\u2013THF, afforded the target phenolic styrylthiophenes without the requirement of an extra demethylation step.",

Although none of these vinyl ether or vinyl thioether analogs was significantly better at inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive microorganisms than the original natural product 1, many were approximately equipotent in the assays. For example, the phenolic ether 12 was equipotent to 1 in the inhibition of the growth of both S. aureus and M. smegmatis (16 \u03bcg/mL) and only 2-fold less potent than 1 in the inhibition of the growth of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and B. cereus (32 \u03bcg/mL). Likewise, phenolic thioether 16 had the same MIC value as 1 in the inhibition of the growth of both S. aureus and B. cereus (16 \u03bcg/mL), and was only 2-fold less potent than 1 against MRSA (32 \u03bcg/mL) and M. smegmatis (128 \u03bcg/mL). These initial results are highly encouraging in consideration of the viability of using phenoxystyrene and phenothiostyrene scaffold structural analogs of bioactive antimicrobial stilbenes to treat disease because they are stable at low and high pH values. Indeed, these novel scaffolds may serve as excellent starting points for further chemical optimization and the development of new drugs that are certainly needed to combat threatening MRSA, tuberculosis, and anthrax infections. Furthermore, because trans-stilbenes have been shown to possess such a diverse array of biological activity,11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 these findings should promote additional SAR studies of stilbenoid compounds for additional therapeutic areas.",

Importantly, 1 was active against M. bovis (BCG) and against B. anthracis, as well as three related Bacillus species. When the phenolic stilbene scaffold was modified with other aryl moieties or extended by one heteroatom to create the novel phenoxystyrene and phenothiostyrene derivatives, these agents also demonstrated promising antimicrobial activity, given that at least one phenolic moiety was present, as in compounds 8\u201316 and 26. Consequently, further exploration of these novel scaffolds is warranted from both synthetic and microbiological perspectives. Additional SAR studies of these novel homologous stilbenoid compounds and more extensive microbiological characterization of the active agents are currently underway.",
