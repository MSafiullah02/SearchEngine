Older patients (>60 years) and those with comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and chronic kidney disease) present with more severe infection and worse prognosis. 1 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been described in only one patient with HIV in Wuhan, China, 2 but case series in patients with HIV are lacking despite 37\u00b79 million people having HIV globally. 3 Here we describe, to our knowledge, the first single-centre experience of COVID-19 in patients infected with HIV-1, including clinical characteristics, antiviral and antiretroviral treatment, and outcomes.",

Two patients had comorbid conditions. Two patients were sex workers. Four were virologically suppressed: two with protease-inhibitor (darunavir-boosted cobicistat) and two with integrase-inhibitor (dolutegravir)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). CD4 counts were above 400 cells per \u00b5L in all patients apart from patient 5, who was ART naive and a very advanced late presenter. Two patients had upperrespiratory tract infections, and three Lopinavir-boosted ritonavir was given as 400 mg of ritonavir boosted with 100 mg of lopinavir twice a day for 14 days; azithromycin was given as 500 mg once a day, with a loading dose on the first day, and then 250 mg once a day for 4 days; hydroxychloroquine was given as 400 mg twice a day with a loading dose on the first day and then 200 mg twice a day for 4 days, and interferon beta-1b was given as 250 \u03bcg (8 million units) every 48 h.

            "text": "Our preliminary experience highlights several issues. First, patients with HIV accounted for almost 1% of patients with COVID-19 who required admission to hospital in Barcelona. We only observed the infection in people younger than 50 years, who identified as MSM, and who have a COVID-19 clinical pictures resembling the general population. None of these five patients has died, although we admitted two to intensive care, where one remains. More studies of COVID-19 in patients with HIV are needed in the older MSM population, drug users, and heterosexual men and women in middle-income and lower-income settings. Second, two patients who were MSM were sex workers, one reporting participating in a chemsex party 6 days before admission to hospital. During this pandemic, implementing health education programmes is very important to explain that such activities as these could cause clusters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Third, we adapted ART in all patients to a regimen based on protease inhibitors: three patients were given lopinavir-boosted ritonavir and two were given darunavirboosted cobici stat. In the past month, a clinical trial 4 found that lopinavirboosted ritonavir was ineffective as a monotherapy against severe pneumonia asso ciated with COVID-19 in China. Therefore, investigation of the efficacy of this treatment in patients with COVID-19 in combined therapy in earlier stages of the disease is needed. Additionally, Janssen reported on March 18, 2020, that darunavir was ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 due to low affinity to coronavirus protease. Fourth, we did not give our patients remdesivir, the most active in-vitro and in-vivo antiviral drug against coronavirus to date, 5 and is currently only available through clinical trials or for compassionate use. This drug has no pharmacokinetic interactions with any medication including ART drugs. Finally, in advanced patients (ie, late presenters), we must ensure differential diagnosis and initial antimicrobial treatment to address pulmonary opportunistic infections (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii, as seen in patient 5) presenting with similar clinical and radiological symptoms. This pandemic is a chall enge affecting everyone. By generating information such as we present here, the management and prognosis of patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 might be improved. ",
