There has been a trend to substitute high flow nasal cannulae which are able to deliver positive pressure, but this pressure is typically not regulated or monitored. In an effort to define the limitations of this approach, Gerdes et al1 identified factors affecting delivered mean airway pressure during nasal CPAP delivery with the RAM\u2122 cannula, an increasingly widely used device favored by some because of its apparent toleration compared with other devices that require more complex fixation systems. Using a polymer model of the upper airway and lip, RAM cannulae, and corresponding standard nCPAP prongs were affixed and delivered pressures measured using a pneumotachograph. As expected, complete occlusion of the nasal passage with either the RAM cannula or \u201cstandard\u201d nasal prongs delivered comparable pressures that approximated the set pressure, providing that the RAM cannula was fully inserted. However, the authors point out a critical limitation to using the RAM cannula, namely that nasal expiratory resistance will be quite high if the nares are occluded.",

The safe use of high\u2010frequency ventilation in newborns limits the ability of the clinician to assess ventilation in real\u2010time. Minute ventilation and tidal volume cannot be measured, and capnography has been limited to transcutaneous CO2 measurements, which have been problematic in very premature newborns that may not tolerate the skin temperatures that until very recently have been required for accurate measurement. Kugelman et al2 evaluated capnography using a 2\u2010lumen endotracheal tube and microstream capnography correlated with arterial blood gas measurements obtained from an indwelling line. Although accuracy was not acceptable, capnography was able to predict very low PaCO2 < 30 Torr and very high PaCO2 above 60 Torr.",

Small\u2010for\u2010dates premature babies are at less risk to develop RDS than their AGA counterparts, but at greater risk to develop BPD if they do have RDS. This likely depends on the etiology of the fetal growth restriction (FGR). Park et al5 examined the relationship between FGR in the absence of infection and inflammation with the risk to develop RDS, providing some mechanistic clues. Since there is an association of chorioamnionitis and post\u2010natal infection with the risk for developing BPD, they excluded cases with inflammation/infection. They cultured amniotic fluid, measured an inflammatory marker (MMP\u20108) in amniotic fluid, and examined the histology of the umbilical cord and placenta. They found that FGR was relatively protective, confirming some earlier observations about SGA babies and risk to develop RDS.",

Pre\u2010clinical studies have demonstrated that early life pulmonary insults can induce pulmonary hypoplasia and PH. In an effort to identify patients that might be at particular risk to develop pulmonary hypertension, K\u00f6nig et al6 correlated systemic markers associated with PH in term newborns\u2014B\u2010type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N\u2010terminal pro\u2010BNP\u2014with one measurement of PH in small premature babies. They chose the right ventricular systolic pressure determined by echocardiogram and found no significant relationship with the BNP moieties. The authors\u2019 rationale for their study was the desirability of a biomarker for PH since echocardiography availability is not universal. Differing mechanisms leading to impaired pulmonary vascular resistance may also be accompanied by differing host\u2010responses to putative therapies. Bao et al,7 for example, show that babies and premature baboons that died with BPD may have had deficits in their ability to respond to inhaled nitric oxide, a widely used therapy for PH, since they had defects in an amino acid transporter important for cellular uptake of S\u2010nitrosocysteine, shown in some studies to be a chemical intermediate to inhaled NO effects. The approach in all forms of PH is inevitably complex and must include addressing multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute, including stabilization of the airways and ventilation, if therapies directed at pulmonary vascular smooth muscle are to be ultimately effective.",

As expected, post\u2010natal hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification. While some of the respiratory system sensitivity to inhaled methacholine may be attributable to loss of alveolar tethering of the airways, the authors showed that there was also increased methacholine sensitivity in isolated tracheal rings, suggesting intrinsic effects on airway smooth muscle. The authors observed durable effects on inflammation in the adult mice as well, showing persistent elevations of pulmonary leukotrienes. This study demonstrates changes in the alveolar and airway structure and function as well as a persistent change in the inflammatory environment. Such early life programming appears to be induced by nicotine as well, possibly through alterations of airway smooth muscle formation. Since perinatal nicotine exposure is associated with increased airway reactivity in offspring, Sakurai et al10 show that prenatal nicotine exposure in rats increases abundance of smooth muscle markers in postnatal rat lungs, but without accompanying markers that would point to epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transformation. They concluded that the nicotine\u2010induction of \u201cmyogenic\u201d markers could explain the physiological phenotype. Corresponding evidence of airway hyperplasia in this model would link the authors\u2019 findings with their earlier reports of increased methacholine induced respiratory system resistance.11\n",

Hamill et al27 investigated whether exhaled breath temperature, as a reflection of airway inflammation in asthma, is correlated with other asthma control measures. They demonstrated good repeatability of the test, but the results were not correlated with any other asthma control parameters such as asthma control test, exhaled nitric oxide or physicians' decision for treatment. Jochman et al28 obtained sputum inductions in young children and compared results from induced sputum with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood. Less than half of the induced sputum samples were adequate for cytology and these had significantly lower number of eosinophils compared to blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Thus, they concluded that induced sputum is not reliable for assessing lower airway eosinophilic inflammation in preschool children. In a longitudinal observation study of 96 children aged 6\u201018 years, asthma control assessed by the asthma control test (ACT) was compared with exhaled breath nitric oxide (NO) and volatile organic compounds (VOC); there was no association between these exhaled markers and ACT, though a subset of exhaled VOC were identified that could categorize children with controlled versus uncontrolled asthma.29 Thomas et al30 showed that agreement between metacholine challenge test results, exhaled nitric oxide, and quality of life was poor in children with asthma, emphasizing that these parameters show different aspects of the disease and only a composite evaluation using all these tools can give us the big picture.",

SCD patients with asthma have poorer outcomes, but it is unknown if airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) itself can be present in SCD without asthma. Shilo et al37 determined the prevalence of AHR in SCD patients without asthma or a recent history of ACS using methacholine challenge testing. They found that 72% off children had AHR and 31% reported asthma\u2010like symptoms despite not having the diagnosis of asthma. Although inflammatory markers did not correlate with AHR, the degree of AHR was less in those study subjects who were receiving hyroxyurea.

R reflects the airway resistive properties of the respiratory system, while X reflects the visco\u2010elastic and inertive elements of the respiratory system. Gochicoa\u2010Rangel40 used FO to assess respiratory function in 31 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), who may not have enough muscle strength to perform spirometry. Compared to age and anthropomorphic matched healthy controls, patients with DMD demonstrated higher R and lower X. R and X were abnormal in DMD patients with less severe disease and tended to normalize with more severe disease. The authors speculate that dystrophin, which is expressed in the airway smooth muscle (ASM) of DMD patients, may induce pseudohypertrophy similar to that seen in the skeletal muscle of these patients. This in turn would reduce airway caliber and increase R. Similarly, ASM pseudohypertrophy would affect the visco\u2010elastic properties of the lung, lowering X. This study demonstrates that IOS can be a useful technique to identify respiratory function abnormalities in DMD patients who cannot perform spirometry. Sakarya et al41 obtained IOS data in a cohort of 49 children ages 3\u201018 years (mean age 7.75 years) with CF during a clinically stable period, at the onset of a pulmonary exacerbation, and after treatment for the exacerbation. At baseline, CF patients had elevated R and X compared to healthy control children. With an exacerbation, R increased and X decreased; both measures improved after treatment of the exacerbation. Although other studies have demonstrated abnormal baseline IOS measurements in CF children and improvement after exacerbation treatment,42, 43 this study is the first to prospectively track IOS changes at baseline and during an exacerbation. Their results suggest that IOS may be a useful method to obtain objective measures of lung function in children with CF at baseline and during illnesses.",

Reinaux et al46 used opto\u2010electronic plethysmography (OEP) to measure motion at 52 sites placed in the thorax and abdomen of healthy infants and compared the results obtained using this system to those obtained using a mask with PNT. They found that measurement of tidal volume using OEP was in good agreement with that obtained using a PNT with a mean difference of only 0.02 mL. The ability to obtain tidal breathing measurements may lead to new insights into changes in chest and abdominal motion in pediatric respiratory disease.",

Despite advances in neonatal medicine, BPD still occurs in 30\u201050% of infants born before a gestational age (GA) of 29 weeks.47 Lung function measured in infants with a history of BPD is lower than that of infants without this complication, but little is known about changes in lung function in infants with BPD compared to those without BPD. Sanchez\u2010Solis et al48 performed infant lung function testing using the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique in 71 preterm infants, 32 of which had BPD, at 6 months and 12 months corrected GA. Although forced vital capacity (FVC) was similar in both groups, all other forced expiratory flow measures were lower in the BPD infants. A similar pattern persisted at the follow up test, indicating a lack of catch\u2010up lung function in BPD infants. BPD infants also had significantly lower weight and length z\u2010scores compared to non\u2010BPD infants, and a higher length growth velocity between the two tests was associated with better improvements in forced expiratory flows. Fortuna et al49 obtained longitudinal lung function data at 8 and 12 years in 48 children born at <29 weeks GA; 28 of these children had BPD. Similar to the findings in infants, FVC was not significantly different between the BPD and non\u2010BPD children, but all preterm children had lower forced expiratory flows compared to health controls, with the BPD children having even lower flows compared to non\u2010BPD children. Over the 4 year follow up period, the z\u2010scores on all spirometric measures in healthy control and non\u2010BPD preterm children remained stable. However, in children with a history of BPD, the forced expiratory volume in 1 s z\u2010score decreased significantly, as did other measures of expiratory flow. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that preterm infants with BPD have greater airflow obstruction than non\u2010BPD infants and that over time, not only does catch\u2010up lung function not occur, but these deficits become even greater. Better growth is associated with better improvement in lung function, emphasizing the importance of focusing on and optimizing nutrition in early life for BPD infants.",

While a commonly used standard definition for bronchiolitis is initial episode of wheezing in a child <12 months old, variability in how clinicians actually define bronchiolitis was highlighted in a report from Fernandes et al.55 Beamer et al56 carried out an interesting risk factor analysis in the context of the Tucson Children's Respiratory Health Study. Spatial clustering analysis, based upon each participant's birth address, was performed for four LRI phenotypes. Being in a viral cluster was associated with poorer housing conditions (OR = 1.28, P = 0.01), while being in a RSV cluster was associated with increased air pollution (OR = 1.14, P = 0.006), poorer housing conditions (OR = 1.54, P = 0.003), and higher SES (OR = 0.77, P = 0.001).",

The median length of hospital stay, severity score, and need for supplemental oxygen did not differ significantly between groups.

In another study with practical implications, Heikkila et al59 analyzed cost of care for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis and found that use of high\u2010flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for oxygen delivery was associated with lower cost, largely through reductions in PICU admission.",

The majority presented with fever and cough, and required prolonged hospitalization; all patients had pulmonary infiltrates including those without respiratory symptoms, and some had disseminated disease.
