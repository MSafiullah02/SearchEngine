ALI pathophysiology is characterised by the increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier, interstitial edema, neutrophil recruitment, and inflammatory stress-induced cell apoptosis [2, 3]. The pathophysiology of sepsis-induced ALI is characterised by complex mechanisms that involve cell inflammation, cytokine production, and abnormal apoptosis [4]. To date, there is no effective pharmacological approach to treat ALI.",

After binding with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), LPS induces the activation of downstream signalling pathways responsible for the infiltration of inflammatory cells (i.e., neutrophils) into the lungs and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [8]. The binding of LPS to TLR4 also induces I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation, promotes the nuclear translocation and activation of NF-\u03baB, and subsequently leads to the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6] [9]. Moreover, LPS can activate JNK, a member of the MAPK family. Activated JNK can phosphorylate numerous mitochondrial proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl [10, 11]. Subsequently, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria, which leads to the activation of death signals [12]. JNK activation is essential for LPS-induced macrophage apoptosis during sepsis [13].",

A subsequent western blot assay further demonstrated that TIPE2 protein levels were significantly increased in the lung tissues of AAV-TIPE2-infected mice. Treatment with AAV-TIPE2 significantly attenuated the histopathological changes induced by LPS (Fig. 1a). In addition, a scoring system was used to assess the degree of lung injury.

Thus, identifying novel therapeutic treatments for ALI is urgently needed. In the current study, we found that TIPE2 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced ALI in mice via its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. First, TIPE2 overexpression significantly improved LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by changes in histopathology, the lung W/D weight ratio, BALF protein concentration, and arterial blood gas. Second, TIPE2 overexpression decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into the lungs and pulmonary cell apoptosis. Third, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of LPS-challenged mice were reduced by AAV-TIPE2 treatment. Fourth, TIPE2 overexpression inhibited LPS-induced NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation and JNK phosphorylation in the lungs. Finally, TIPE2 overexpression prevented lung cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-8) and upregulating the expression of an anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) in the lungs of LPS-challenged mice. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that TIPE2 overexpression ameliorates LPS-induced ALI via reducing lung inflammation and apoptosis, which may be associated with decreased NF-\u03baB and JNK activity.",

TIPE2 deficiency in mice induces foetal inflammatory diseases, and TIPE2 downregulation in humans causes systemic autoimmunity [15, 21]. Moreover, TIPE2 has also been identified as an apoptosis regulator that contains a death effector domain (DED) and is able to inhibit the activities of the apoptotic enzymes caspase-3 and caspase-8 [22]. Sun et al. demonstrated that the deletion of TIPE2 amplifies JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB activation, suggesting that TIPE2 is a negative regulator of JNK, p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB [15].",

            "text": "In LPS-induced ALI, LPS is recognized by TLR4 and subsequently promotes the activation of NF-\u03baB [9], which is a pivotal transcription factor in the pathogenesis of ALI. When activated, NF-\u03baB p65 translocates to the nucleus, where it triggers the transcription of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 [23]. The inactivation of NF-\u03baB p65 inhibits inflammation-induced inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the lungs [24]. In the current study, TIPE2 overexpression significantly inhibited the LPS-induced levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 in the serum-induced and concomitantly decreased NF-\u03baB activation. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of TIPE2 overexpression on LPS-induced increases in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be ascribed to its suppression of NF-\u03baB activation.",

            "text": "Pulmonary cell apoptosis also plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALI [27]. LPS-induced cell apoptosis may be partly dependent on the mitochondria pathway [28]. JNK, a member of the MAPK family, is critical for LPS-induced apoptosis in macrophages [13]. LPS triggers JNK phosphorylation, which subsequently mediates the phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL) and upregulates proapoptotic Bax. When the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is elevated, the mitochondrial membrane potential changes, causing the release of cytochrome C into the cytosol from the mitochondria [29] and resulting in the activation of caspase-9 and then caspase-3 to induce apoptosis [30]. Several previous studies have shown that TIPE2 contains a death effector domain (DED) and that the overexpression of TIPE2 is associated with enhanced survival and the inhibition of caspase-mediated apoptosis through the inhibition of the activities of the apoptotic enzymes caspase-8 and caspase-3 [31\u201333]. In addition, the depletion of TIPE2 enhances cell death [34, 35]. In the current study, we found that AAV-TIPE2 administration remarkably inhibited the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3) and JNK phosphorylation and restored the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These findings suggest that epithelial TIPE2 drives the protective effects against LPS-induced injury and that the inhibitory effect of TIPE2 overexpression on LPS-induced cell apoptosis may be attributed to its suppression of JNK activation.",
