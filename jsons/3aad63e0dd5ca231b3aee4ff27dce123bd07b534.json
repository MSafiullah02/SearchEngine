Our main technical result is an efficient algorithm for computing an optimum structural alignment of an RNA sequence against a genomic substring. This algorithm finds two applications. First, by scanning a genome, we can identify novel (homologous) pseudoknotted ncRNA, and second, we can infer the secondary structure of the target aligned sequence. We test an implementation of our algorithm (PAL), and show that it has near-perfect behavior for predicting the structure of many known pseudoknots. Additionally, it can detect the true homologs with high sensitivity and specificity in controlled tests. We also use PAL to search entire viral genome and mouse genome for novel homologs of some viral, and eukaryotic pseudoknots respectively.

While much of cellular RNA carries a message encoding an amino-acid sequence, other, 'non-coding' RNA participate directly in performing essential functions. Recent and unanticipated discoveries of novel ncRNA families [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] point to the possibility of a 'Modern RNA world' in which RNA molecules are as abundant, and diverse as protein molecules [6] . The analog of the computational gene-finding problem: \"given genomic DNA, identify all substrings that encode ncRNA\" is increasingly relevant, and relatively unexplored. While potentially abundant, RNA signals are weaker than proteins making them harder to identify computationally. Possibly, the strongest clue is from secondary structure. Being single-stranded, the base-pairs stabilize by forming hydrogen bonds, leading to a characteristic secondary and tertiary structure. With a few exceptions, the base-pairs are non-crossing, and form a tree-like structure. This recursive structure is the basis for efficient algorithms to predict RNA structure [7, 8] . With this extensive work in structure prediction, it is natural to expect that novel noncoding RNA could be discovered simply by looking for genomic sub-strings that fold These authors contributed equally in the research. into low-energy structures. Unfortunately, that idea doesn't work. Rivas and Eddy [9] showed that random DNA (usually with high GC-content) can also 'fold' into lowenergy configurations, making it unlikely for a purely de novo approach to be successful. Therefore, a comparative approach is employed, often typified by the question: \"Given a query RNA with known structure, and a genome, identify all genomic substrings that match the query sequence and structure\". The query itself can be either a single molecule or a model (covariance model/stochastic context free grammar) of an RNA structure. This approach has been quite successful and single queries as well as covariance based models are routinely used to annotate genomes with ncRNA [10, 11] . Central to these approaches is an algorithm for computing a local alignment between a query structure and a DNA string.

Figure 7 (a) shows the results for the Corona-FSE family, in which 17 members were embedded in a 19kb random sequence. The windowed scores are shown by solid lines. The actual positions of the remaining 17 members are denoted by '*'. We note that the true hits are easily the highest scoring regions along the sequence, and that all true positives score higher than all the false hits. The lowest scoring TP has a score of 988 and the highest scoring FP has a score of 606. Moreover, the random sequence scores do not show a large variation. We do not compute P -values on the hits, but in future work, we will use the distribution of scores on random, or genomic sequence (with differing GC-content) to compute the P -value. In general, the distribution is not understood, and we will either use a non-parametric value such as the Chebyshev's inequality [26] , or perhaps the Gumbel distribution, which has been shown to be a good approximation to the actual distribution [11] . In contrast, Blastn (E-value 10, Word-size 7) is able to locate only 4 of the members. These results also show the significance of the secondary structure for searching homologue in addition to the primary structure. We repeat the same experiment for RNA families, UPSK, Antizyme, Parecho, Corona-FSE, Corona-pk3 and IFN-gamma. In all cases, PAL locates all members as the topmost hits (See Figure 7 (b)). We agree that Blast is not the most appropriate tool for comparison as other tools such as RSEARCH, and our own tool FastR can search for structural homologs of RNA [11, 26] . However, these other tools cannot align psuedoknotted RNA and the search must be followed up with a correct alignment to determine homologs.
