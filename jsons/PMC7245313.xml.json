Eleven days after the onset of a dry cough, with loss of appetite and a worsening general condition, but with no fever or dyspnoea, she suffered a syncope and was hospitalised. Her haemostatic laboratory values at admission (day 11) and 7 days later are summarised in Table 1 (patient 2). VWF activity, VWF antigen and FVIII:C were markedly elevated, and ADAMTS13 activity was normal. In accordance with our local guidelines for anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19, stratified by D-dimer levels, the patient received a double-prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin, i.e. 2 \u00d7 5000 IU of dalteparin s.c. per day upon admission. Seven days later, due to increasing D-dimers, anticoagulation was intensified to a therapeutic dose of dalteparin, i.e. 10\u2032000 IU in the morning and 7\u2032500 IU at night. The patient has since recovered and after a 15-day hospitalisation was discharged home with therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban, 5 mg twice daily. Of note, anti-phospholipid antibodies were normal or near normal (Table 1).",

Radiological findings showed typical COVID-19 associated diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. Initially her D-dimer levels were 0.53 mg/L and prophylactic dalteparin 5000 IU s.c. once daily was given. While clinically stable and with C-reactive protein decreasing from 78 to 16 mg/L, monitoring of the haemostatic laboratory values 14 days after the onset of symptoms showed elevated D-dimers and massively elevated levels of VWF and FVIII:C (Table 1, patient 3).

In addition, reports from China showed a coagulopathy in 50% of the non-survivors and the prognostic value of D-dimers [3,4]. Based on these observations, we adapted our local guidelines with increased dose heparin according to D-dimer levels. After introducing therapeutic-dose anticoagulation into our therapeutic concept, all patients recovered, with rapid clinical improvement but slow and protracted improvement of D-dimers, persistently high VWF and factor VIII:C levels, and, interestingly, also of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No haemorrhagic complication occurred. Since then, the findings of highly elevated VWF and factor VIII have also been reported in a small Italian and a large French cohort [5,6]. Furthermore, in two recent autopsy series, thromboembolic complications, including thrombi in the small to mid-sized pulmonary arteries were a striking common finding [7,8]. Randomised trials will clarify the utility of anticoagulation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (NCT04344756, NCT04345848, NCT04359212, NCT04362085, and NCT04359277), and we await their results to further inform our practice.",

Notably, there were no schistocytes in the blood smears, which does not support a diagnosis of classic thrombotic microangiopathy. Whereas in severe sepsis or septic shock not due to SARS-CoV-2, some 30% of patients had mildly reduced ADAMTS13 activity of 27\u201350% [9], our 3 COVID-19 patients had normal ADAMTS13 activity suggesting that ADAMTS13 does not play a major pathogenic role in the COVID-19 coagulopathy. Moreover, the normal platelet counts and high fibrinogen levels in all our patients (lowest value 3.48 g/L) clearly rule out classical disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in our patients, in keeping with the low prevalence of DIC (0\u20132%) in other larger cohorts [6,[10], [11], [12]]. Published evidence has shown viral particles in endothelial cells by electron microscopy, and an endotheliitis has been postulated [13]. Considering these findings, the COVID-19 coagulopathy may be a distinct entity of highly prothrombotic alterations and - in light of the persistently and excessively elevated levels of VWF and FVIII - most probably an endothelial disease.",
