            "text": "Viral infections represent a grave threat to public health as well as the global economy. Viral infections mostly occur through contaminated water, food, and/or bodily fluids, spread rapidly and result in death of humans and animals worldwide.1,2 Significant concerns has raised due to the increased viral outbreaks, since the viruses could quickly spread and cause a pandemic. Thus, rapid and accurate detection can mean the difference between life and death during viral infections. Analytes such as viral nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), viral proteins, intact viral particles, and antibodies generated by the patient immune response against the virus have been used to detect viruses with the goal of being used in clinical situations. These analytes are detected using a variety of traditional methods including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blots, and serological antibody detection methods.3,4 However, conventional techniques are often not suitable for rapid on-site analysis as they require virus isolation and biocontainment, the ability to grow cultured cells for cytopathology-related assay, and/or sophisticated and expensive laboratory tools that are difficult to transport and use at the point of care. Traditional laboratory-based assays are also time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can in some cases relatively insensitive, and in all cases require samples to be transported to centralized diagnostic laboratories for testing.5,6 These factors increase time-to-answer and costs while reducing the quality of patient care.",

However, there several challenges remain for nucleic acid biosensors. First, the effective use of nucleic acid biosensors requires that the target nucleic acid be accessible to the biosensor surface. Virus nucleic acids in patient samples (serum, saliva, urine, etc.) are generally protected from their environments inside viral particles. For the biosensor to detect the nucleic acid, the virus particles need to be disrupted in a way that releases the nucleic acid from the viral particle. Disruption of virus particles can be performed via heating or chemical treatment, which adds additional sample preparation procedures into the testing paradigm needed to detect target nucleic acids. Heat disruption is the gentlest way of disruption particles, although solvent conditions during heating need to be well controlled to avoid base-mediated hydrolysis of RNA genomes. Chemical disruption using detergents to dissolve membranes (sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X 100, etc.) and chaotropic agents to unfold proteins (urea, guanidinium hydrochloride, etc.) can be effective, but can affect subsequent steps in analyte detection and must be removed. Protein removal is particularly important in negative sense RNA viruses, such as Influenza and Ebola viruses, as the genomes present in viral particles are tightly bound to nucleoproteins that must be removed before sequence-specific probes can recognize viral RNAs. Nucleic acid purification is essential for detecting viral genomic nucleic acids in real patient samples, but increases the time and effort required to sense nucleic acid analytes.",

            "text": "Another critical issue with nucleic acid biosensors is viral genome structure. Many of the nucleic acid sensors listed above test their system using short oligonucleotide DNAs that contain viral sequences. Short RNA or DNA sequences purchased from commercial vendors are inexpensive, easy to work with, and available at high concentrations but are very different than purified viral genomes. Long single-stranded viral genomes can adopt a wide range of thermodynamically stable secondary structures (including stems, loops, and pseudoknots) and these structures can strongly interfere with sequence-specific DNA probes from recognizing the target nucleic acid.72 Hybridization of DNA probes with long single-stranded nucleic acids requires the target first being completely denatured to remove inhibitory secondary structure, followed by time for limited numbers of denatured target genomes to interact with surface-bound probe DNAs. Hybridization in this context is similar to hybridization performed in nuclease protection assays, which use long RNA probes (200\u2013500 bases) with a short 95\u00b0C denaturation step followed by 12\u201316 hr incubations at high temperatures (55\u201365\u00b0C) in high ionic strength solutions to reduce secondary structure formation and achieve efficient and specific hybridization. These conditions are not required for the short oligonucleotide targets but are critical for detecting longer genomes. Incorporation of rapid and efficient hybridization conditions are essential for nucleic acid biosensors to be useful at the point of care. The use of molecular crowding chemicals (such as polyethylene glycol) or applying electrophoretic potentials to biosensors to increase local concentrations of DNA probes and target nucleic acids to increase hybridization rates may help decrease hybridization time and increase efficiency.",

Base-paring between both strands of dsRNA and dsDNA viral genomes generally precludes biosensor-bound probe molecules from binding in a sequence-specific manner, making recognition impossible. Variants of traditional nucleic acids, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and bridged nucleic acids (BNAs), have the potential to undergo strand invasion and perform local denaturation of nucleic acids, but these tend to be relatively expensive. Additionally, while it is possible to denature double-stranded nucleic acids with heat or chemical treatment, the affinity of the long single-stranded genome strands for each other is generally much higher than the affinity for short DNA probes bound on biosensor surfaces. This leads to complementary strands of viral genomes preferentially re-hybridizing to each other rather than to the biosensor-bound DNA, reducing the sensitivity of the biosensor.",

            "text": "Finally, the amount of viral genomes present in clinical samples is generally fairly small and in many cases much lower than the LOD of reported biosensors. For example, Faye et al. performed a retrospective study of viremia (viral genome copies/ml plasma) in Ebola virus infected individuals and compared viral loads to disease outcomes.73 This study found that patients with less than 105 genome copies/ml had a low probability of death, patients with viral titers between 105 and 106 had moderate probability of death, and patients with titers over 106 had a high probability of death. Viral titers over 108 genome copies/ml were not observed in patients. 108 genome copies/ml appears to be quite a large number, but actually only represents approximately 166 attomoles of viral genomes per ml of plasma. Biosensors that demonstrate nanomolar and picomolar LODs are 6 to 9 orders of magnitudes less sensitive than necessary to detect Ebola virus even in very highly infected patients as described above. For nucleic acid biosensors to be useful for detecting viral genomes without additional amplification, they need to be able to detect between 109 genomes/ml (1.6 femtomoles) and 1000 molecules/ml (1.6 zeptomoles). In other words, detection limits for biosensors should be below \u223c100 aM for the biosensor to be able to detect clinically relevant infections.",

According to World Health Organization recent data, 36.9 million people have been affected by HIV worldwide.90 According to recent studies, it is possible to decrease the transmission up to 96% by early antiretroviral treatment so rapid and accurate point-of-care (POC) detection of HIV infection status is critical for protecting patients.91 For FET fabrication, graphene was exfoliated on SiO2/Si substrate and then electron beam lithography and thermal evaporation techniques were applied to pattern the electrodes. Graphene was reacted with EDC and NHS to activate its carboxylic groups on the surface. Anti-p24 antibody for HIV was covalently conjugated by dropping on the activated graphene FET. While the specific antibody bound the p24 antigens, the graphene layer converted the chemical signal from antibody-antigen interactions into a measurable electrical signal. The sensor exhibited a linear response to p24 protein from 1 fg/mL to 1 \u03bcg/mL with an LOD of 100 fg/mL. The graphene-based FET immunosensor exhibited better response time and sensitivity compared to traditional methods but does require more expensive fabrication methods.",

Subsequently, capture antibodies of H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 were immobilized onto the ZnO NRs grown on three sensor regions of the PDMS surface. Finally, H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 antigens were incubated on sensors followed by injection of detection antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was oxidized by HRP enzyme resulting in signal production.

The first challenge is generation of consistent high affinity antibodies that selectively target the analyte of interest. Antibodies are notoriously variable from lot to lot, meaning sensors can work with one batch but not the next. Monoclonal antibodies generally have better reproducibility but bind only a single epitope giving rise to potential problems with number of binding sites. Another antibody related problem is immobilization on the surface of the electrode. If care is not given to the method, a significant fraction (up to 75%) can be either denatured or immobilized in a manner that makes antigen binding impossible. Careful consideration of immobilization techniques and blocking for non-specific adsorption is required. Finally, antibodies can lack stability relative to DNA/RNA reagents and often require cold storage to maintain shelf life. Increased temperatures, ionic concentrations, and reducing agents can inactivate antibodies on sensor surfaces and dramatically reduce the efficacy of the sensor. Therefore, appropriate buffer composition and temperature control are critical considerations in the use of antibody-based sensors.",

Viruses are notorious for both mutating to change their coat proteins and for having coat proteins that are very similar. For the former, one need only consider influenza. New flu vaccines are needed each year because a new influenza variant appears almost every year. This makes creating antibodies against the mutating species very difficult. Likewise, the similarity of coat proteins across virus serotypes is a significant challenge for selective antibody-based sensors. For example, there are four main dengue virus, and creating antibodies that can distinguish between these serotypes is non-trivial.

Aptamers have the benefit of being relatively easy to mass produce through chemical synthesis techniques and provide reasonably high specificities and binding affinities, similar to antibodies.119 Synthetic oligonucleotide aptamers can be easily produced with multiple different attachment chemistries (thiol, NHS, amines, carboxylates, etc.) at the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of the aptamer or on internal bases if desired, allowing very precise control of the orientation that the aptamer binds to the sensor surface. Oligonucleotide-based aptamers have the added benefit of being able to re-fold into their active structures if the sensor surface encounters harsh conditions (increased ionic strength solutions, denaturing reagents, increased temperatures).120 This can allow sensors using aptamers as the affinity reagent to potentially be re-used, increasing the utility and decreasing the costs associated with the assays. Therefore, aptamers possess significant advantages as sensor-coupled affinity reagents compared to protein-based affinity reagents. However, several challenges do exist with the use of aptamers that should be considered. The most significant problem with aptamers, however, is the lack of known aptamers for virus detection related sensing. The number of high affinity aptamers is very limited relative to the number of antibodies and development of new aptamers takes time and specialized knowledge limiting the rate at which new reagents are reported. Another issue that should be considered with nucleic acid-based aptamers, especially RNA based aptamers, is degradation by RNAse enzymes. RNAses are relatively ubiquitous and care should be taken to protect RNA aptamers from degradation by RNAses, which would reduce the sensitivity of the sensor. This can be mitigated by addition of RNAse inhibitors (such RiboLock) with the analyte during sensing. DNA and 2\u2019O-modified aptamers tend to be less sensitive to nuclease digestion and can be used without additional nuclease inhibitors.",
