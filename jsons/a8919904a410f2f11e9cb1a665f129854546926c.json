While respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumonvirus, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenza viruses are well known for their potential to cause fatal pneumonia, information has only recently emerged regarding the significance of the newly discovered viruses, such as human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus. Lymphopenia seems to be the most important risk factor for progression to lower respiratory tract disease. Airflow obstruction is another complication of respiratory virus infections after HCT, and data to date indicate this complication may occur following parainfluenza virus and RSV infection. Infection control procedures are key for prevention. Unfortunately, there are no randomized treatment studies, which make the interpretation of the literature on interventions difficult. This article reviews the spectrum of pathogens, epidemiology, risk factors and clinical manifestations of infection, as well as recent advances in diagnostic and clinical management.",

These syndromes span from the mere common cold episodes to incidences of croup, bronchiolitis, and airflow obstruction in children. Moreover, respiratory viruses may lead to exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frank pneumonia in adults . While direct mortality is rarely associated with these viruses in immunocompetent people, the impact on quality of life and the economic losses are substantial. In contrast, the clinical spectrum of disease is much more severe in immunocompromised patients. Respiratory viruses can cause fatal pneumonia and trigger a late airflow obstruction syndrome, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (Whimbey et al, 1993 Ljungman, 2001; Nichols et al, 2001a; Chemaly et al, 2006; Erard et al, 2006) . This review will summarize the current status of respiratory virus diagnostics, disease associations, and management strategies.",

Indeed, these techniques offer the potential for multiplex testing platforms (Lee et al, 2007; Mahony et al, 2007; Nolte et al, 2007) . This is important because of the non-specific clinical presentation of these infections. This ''syndromic'' nature of respiratory viral infections will ultimately require a multiplex testing platform for comprehensive detection of these pathogens. Several assays have been described in the literature. The Hexaplex TM assay detects seven respiratory viruses and has shown excellent performance characteristics in various clinical settings (Hindiyeh et al, 2001; Kehl et al, 2001) . Another multiplex platform (MultiCode-PLx system, EraGen Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI) detected 17 respiratory viruses simultaneously and showed significantly increased diagnostic yield compared to DFA or culture methods. This was mainly caused by improved detection of influenza A virus and viruses not readily detected by standard virological methods, including HMPV, HcoV, and HRhV (Nolte et al, 2007) . A 20-respiratory virus microbead-based assay also showed excellent sensitivity and specificity, as well as an increased yield for detection of viruses that are difficult to detect by culture or DFA (Mahony et al, 2007) . Microarray and nanotechnologies are also being explored in order to develop large-scale and efficient viral detection platforms (Liu et al, 2006; Chiu et al, 2007; Fournier-Wirth & Coste, 2007) .",

URI precedes pneumonia in 80-90% of patients, and approximately 30-40% of patients with RSV URI progress to pneumonia after a median of 7 d. However, in some patients with RSV pneumonia, URI is not present, is very mild, or occurs only concurrently with the onset of pneumonia (Nichols et al, 2001a) . Strongest risk factors for progression to pneumonia are older age and lymphopenia (Nichols et al, 2001a) . During the first 3 months after HCT, patients receiving non-myeloablative conditioning regimens seem to be protected from progression to lower respiratory tract disease (Schiffer et al, 2006) . Following reduced intensity conditioning, regimens may also have a somewhat lower risk of progression and fatal disease (Chakrabarti et al, 2002) , however, larger studies are needed to better define the risk of progression. Most studies indicate that asymptomatic shedding of RSV is not a common phenomenon (Ljungman et al, 1989; Adams et al, 1999; Peck et al, 2007) .",

            "text": "Without treatment, RSV pneumonia is almost uniformly fatal in highly immunosuppressed HCT recipients (Harrington et al, 1992) . However, recovery from RSV lower respiratory tract disease without specific treatment has been reported (Abdallah et al, 2003) . These differences are probably due to less intense immunosuppressive regimens and whether lymphopenia is present at the time of diagnosis (Chemaly et al, 2006) . Pulmonary copathogens are detected in up to one third of the patients with RSV pneumonia and require aggressive treatment. No adequately powered controlled trials exist for the treatment of RSV infection and pneumonia in the HCT setting. Available evidence comes from small uncontrolled cohort studies and one small randomized trial . The data suggest that treatment of early pneumonia (i.e. prior to mechanical ventilation) is associated with improved outcome. Intermittent short duration (2 g, over 2 h, three times per day) or continuous aerosolized ribavirin is considered the treatment of choice for RSV pneumonia. With this regimen, the 30-d all-cause mortality is approximately 40% (Table I ). In a large multivariate analysis, RSV pneumonia (but not URI) was independently associated with mortality (Nichols et al, 2001a) . Systemic ribavirin alone does not seem to be effective for the treatment of pneumonia (Lewinsohn et al, 1996; Sparrelid et al, 1997) ; better response rates were reported for treatment of RSV URI, however, the small sample size limits the strength of the data (Schleuning et al, 2004) . There are no data on combined oral and aerosolized ribavirin. The role of concomitant intravenous immunoglobulin, or RSV-specific immunoglobulin, or palivizumab, an RSVspecific monoclonal antibody directed at the F protein of RSV, for the treatment of RSV pneumonia is poorly defined. Uncontrolled data suggest that high-titer antibody preparations or palivizumab may be required if such adjunctive therapy is given (DeVincenzo et al, 2000; Boeckh et al, 2001; Small et al, 2002) . There are several factors that may account for differences in outcome in the available cohort studies.",

A recent small controlled study of preemptive, antiviral therapy of aerosolized ribavirin, given at the time of RSV URI, showed a decline in viral load, but no significant difference in RSV pneumonia; the study was prematurely stopped due to slow accrual . A larger retrospective study suggests that this strategy may be effective (Chemaly et al, 2006) . Whether ribavirin is indicated for RSV URI remains controversial; some centers (including the author's) administer it in the presence of lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <0AE3 \u00b7 10 9 /l) when the risk of progression is particularly high Chemaly et al, 2006) . Lymphopenia is a highly significant risk factor for progression to lower tract disease during the first 3 months after HCT Chemaly et al, 2006) . There is no data on the risk of progression later after HCT; anecdotal experience suggests that other factors, such as poor lung function, may be more important in patients with prolonged immunosuppression; further studies are needed to define the risk factors in this setting. Whether palivizumab given preemptively to patients with RSV URI to prevent progression to lower respiratory tract disease is effective has not been definitively determined (Chavez-Bueno et al, 2007; Khanna et al, 2008) .",

By the age of 5 years, virtually all children are seropositive. The virus can cause upper and lower tract infection during the winter season (Boivin et al, 2002) . Serious lower respiratory tract disease associated with HMPV has been reported in immunocompromised patients, but no risk factors for acquisition have been described (Table II) . HMPV infection occurs in up to 5% of HCT recipients (Fig 2) . Whether asymptomatic shedding occurs is controversial (Debiaggi et al, 2007; Peck et al, 2007) . The progression rate to lower respiratory tract disease has not been determined. Among HCT recipients undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for clinical and radiographic pneumonia, 3-4% had HMPV detected (Englund et al, 2006) . Most of these patients were previously classified as having idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (Englund et al, 2006) . HMPV disease in HCT recipients immediately post-transplant presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including: fever, nasal congestion, and cough. Once pneumonia developed, rapidly progressive pulmonary infiltrates, frequently accompanied by hypotension, septic shock, or both, were observed (Englund et al, 2006) . Radiographic findings ranged from diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial infiltrates to emphysema without infiltrate. A high viral load was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological assessment showed that diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, foci of bronchiolitis obliterans and organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are common (Englund et al, 2006) .",

Of the four types of parainfluenza viruses, parainfluenzavirus 3 is the most common (approximately 90%), followed by serotypes 1 and 2. The incubation time is 1-4 d. Parainfluenzavirus infections remain detectable throughout the summer season (Fig 1) . Even with standard virological methods, the incidence of parainfluenzaviruses is higher than that of RSV in different cancer centers (Nichols et al, 2001a) . PCR detection significantly increases the diagnostic yield . Other than HCT from an unrelated donor, no risk factor for acquisition of the parainfluenzavirus has been found (Nichols et al, 2001a) . In T cell-depleted patients, CD4 lymphopenia has been reported to increase the risk of all respiratory virus infections, including parainfluenzavirus infections (Chakrabarti et al, 2002) .",

            "text": "Similar to RSV and HMPV, URI is the predominant clinical presentation (Table II) . Progression to pneumonia seems to be less common than with RSV (Nichols et al, 2001a) . Late airflow obstruction has been linked, not only to parainfluenzavirus pneumonia, but also to URI (Erard et al, 2006) . The most important risk factors for the progression from URI to pneumonia is use of systemic corticosteroids and lymphopenia. ( Nichols et al, 2001b; Chakrabarti et al, 2002) . During the first 3 months after HCT, recipients of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens appear to have a small risk of progression to lower respiratory tract disease (Schiffer et al, 2006) . Reduced intensity conditioning regimens may also have a somewhat lower risk of progression and fatal disease (Chakrabarti et al, 2002) , however, larger studies are needed to better define the risk of progression. Although the overall progression rate to pneumonia is only 18%, in allograft recipients the risk is 40% if 1 mg/kg of prednisone is given (for treatment of graft-versus-host disease, GvHD), and 65% with 2 mg/kg (Nichols et al, 2001b) . Parainfluenzavirus 3 pneumonia may also occur after autologous transplantation, however, mainly in the setting of CD34 selection or use of high-dose steroids (Nichols et al, 2001b) . Parainfluenzavirus 3 pneumonia is associated with serious pulmonary co-pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, in approximately half of the cases. Factors associated with poor outcome after pneumonia include presence of co-pathogens and mechanical ventilation (Nichols et al, 2001b) . Thus, aggressive diagnostic intervention (i.e. BAL) and therapy are indicated in patients with suspected parainfluenzavirus pneumonia. In a large retrospective analysis both URI and pneumonia, due to parainfluenzavirus 3, were associated with overall mortality in multivariable models (Nichols et al, 2001b) .",

Outcome appears to be somewhat better in patients who received reduced toxicity conditioning regimens (Chakrabarti et al, 2002) . In a retrospective analysis, neither aerosolized ribavirin nor intravenous immunoglobulin led to improved outcome of pneumonia or a reduction in viral shedding following pneumonia (Nichols et al, 2001b) . Systemic ribavirin has only been reported in case reports (Chakrabarti et al, 2000a) . Randomized treatment studies have not been performed. No definitive assessment can be made as to whether earlier antiviral treatment (i.e. preemptive treatment for URI) is effective in the prevention of pneumonia or late airflow obstruction (Chakrabarti et al, 2000a) . The association of high-dose steroid treatment with progression to disease might suggest that reduction on immunosuppression may be useful (Nichols et al, 2001b) , however, such an approach has not been tested. The role of immunoglobulin in the treatment of parainfluenzavirus infections is also poorly defined. One retrospective analysis did not find a benefit of pooled immunoglobulin given for parainfluenzavirus pneumonia (Nichols et al, 2001b) . However, antibody content in pooled preparations is highly variable. The highest titers can be obtained from RSV-specific immunoglobulin that also contains high titer of antibodies directed against parainfluenzavirus (Cortez et al, 2002) .",

Health care personnel, family members, and visitors are advised to get vaccinated against influenza early in the season. Antiviral therapy is available for influenza virus infection; however, available agents have not been studied systematically in HCT recipients. Due to the recent emergence of resistance against the M2-inhibitors, amantidine and rimantidine, these agents should not be used to treat or prevent influenza A (Bright et al, 2006) . Neuraminidase inhibitors (i.e. zanamavir, oseltamivir) are now available (Hayden et al, 1997; Nicholson et al, 2000) and are active against influenza A and B. Uncontrolled studies suggest that preemptive therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors (i.e. oseltamivir, zanamivir) is effective in preventing progression to lower tract disease (Johny et al, 2002; Nichols et al, 2004a; Chemaly et al, 2006) . Widespread chemoprophylaxis for susceptible immunosuppressed patients in outbreak situations has been recommended [Centers for Disease Control; Prevention; Infectious Diseases Society of America; American Society of Blood; Marrow Transplantation (CDC/IDSA/AS-BMT), 2000], and a case-control study of oseltamivir suggests that this approach is safe in HCT recipients (Vu et al, 2007) .",

There are approximately 100 serotypes, which usually cause mild upper respiratory tract symptoms in immunocompetent hosts. Using culture techniques, rhinovirus is infrequently reported as a cause of respiratory infection in HCT recipients. However, several reports found the organism in patients with pneumonia. Ghosh et al (1999) reported lower tract disease in seven of 22 patients with rhinovirus infection while Bowden (1997) documented lower tract disease in only one of 29 infected patients. Rhinovirus appears to occasionally cause lower respiratory tract disease (Gutman et al, 2007) , although a clear causative role is sometimes difficult to ascertain because of the presence of co-pathogens (Ghosh et al, 1999; Ison et al, 2003) . Surveillance studies using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR are ongoing in order to more precisely define the role of HRhV in HCT recipients. Enteroviruses are also picornaviruses. They are transmitted by the fecal-oral and respiratory route. Respiratory infections can occur, but limited evidence exists as to their significance as respiratory pathogens.",

Recently, cidofovir has been shown to have in vitro activity, and several uncontrolled case series showed promising results (Legrand et al, 2001; Ljungman et al, 2003; Yusuf et al, 2006; Neofytos et al, 2007; Sivaprakasam et al, 2007) . Ganciclovir has in vitro activity against adenovirus and has a moderate effect in the prevention of adenovirus infection in non-T cell-depleted patients (Bruno et al, 2003) . However, ganciclovir is not recommended for the treatment of adenovirus disease. The antiretroviral drugs, zalzitabine (DDC), alovudine, and stavudine, have activity in vitro (Naesens et al, 2005; Uchio et al, 2007) . Differences in in vitro susceptibility and treatment outcome results between studies may be due to strain and serotype differences, which often were not reported in these studies.

However, this strategy does not completely eliminate adenovirus disease in highest-risk patients (Yusuf et al, 2006) even if cidofovir is initiated at any viral load. In T cell-replete transplant recipients, plasma DNAemia of greater than 1000 copies/mL correlated well with the presence of adenovirus disease (Erard et al, 2007) . At what level preemptive antiviral therapy should be initiated depends both on the PCR assay performance characteristics and the underlying immunosuppression. The latter determines the in vivo viral dynamics. At this time, no definitive threshold has been established, however, repeated testing after 2-3 d of a low viral load test can identify patients with a rapid increase in viral load. The use of adenovirus-specific T cells for prevention and treatment of adenovirus disease are an area of active research (Feuchtinger et al, 2006) . Randomized trials are needed to evaluate prevention strategies.",

Hand washing is the single most effective way of preventing spread of respiratory viruses, and should be performed after each patient contact by all health care personnel and visitors. Respiratory isolation is used for HCT recipients with documented respiratory virus infections, as well as upper respiratory symptoms during the diagnostic work-up period (masks, gowns, gloves, and eye protection). One area of uncertainty is when to lift isolation in patients who have become asymptomatic, but have persistent low-level shedding which is only detected by molecular methods. To what extent these patients are contagious is presently unknown. For the viruses that are known to cause serious disease (i.e. RSV, parainfluenzaviruses, influenzaviruses, HMPV), it appears prudent to isolate patients that are positive by PCR, even if they are asymptomatic. Whether this is necessary for viruses with an extremely uncommon or unclear disease association (e.g. HRhV, HCoV), is presently an area of active research.",

One non-randomized study suggests a benefit of masks (Raad et al, 1997) . However, questions remain on the type of mask, frequency of changing the mask, and who should wear masks. Not all transplant centers have a universal mask policy. Recent CDC guidelines recommend using masks during patient transport [CDC/IDSA/ASBMT (2000)]. Another approach that is likely to reduce transmission is to restrict health care workers and family members from patient contact if they have URI and systemic symptoms, such as rhinorhea, watery eyes, sneezing, fever, and myalgia . Such a strategy will only be effective for infections that present with significant drainage and symptoms, such as RSV, rhinovirus, HMPV, and influenza infections. Parainfluenzavirus infections, which may present with only mild symptoms, may be missed by this approach (Nichols et al, 2004a; Peck et al, 2007) . Most centers restrict small children from direct patient contact during the respiratory virus season, due to their predisposition to URIs and prolonged high-titer shedding [CDC/IDSA/ASBMT (2000)].",

Although major progress has been made in understanding disease associations and in the development of diagnostic tests, major gaps remain. One such gap is the availability of a sensitive, specific, and inexpensive multiplex diagnostic platform that detects all relevant respiratory viruses, and optimally, important bacterial pathogens, as well. Fortunately, the development of such testing methods is advancing. The establishment of these Review \u00aa 2008 The Author methods will enable the study of disease associations, and will also be essential for the development of more therapeutic options, not only in the immunosuppressed, but also in immunocompetent subjects. One key reason for the slow progress in drug development is the absence of widespread office-based testing (Nichols et al, 2008) . A systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the disease burden of these infections is also needed. Historically, only pneumonia and death were reported, however, data on airflow obstruction, health care utilization including duration of hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation are important as well.",

Although several studies point towards lymphopenia as an important risk factor for severe manifestations of disease, the exact host defence mechanisms that lead to the devastating consequences of respiratory virus infections in HCT recipients are virtually unknown. Studies of the importance of virus load, T cell and humoral immunity, as well as cytokine and chemokine expression, and genetics, are needed. To date, most studies focus on the early period after transplantation. More information is needed on the risk of progression and outcome, late after HCT (i.e. after the first 3 months), when lymphopenia is rare. There may be a birectional relationship between respiratory viruses and lung function late after transplantion; viral infections may lead to prolonged airflow obstruction, and preexisting airflow obstruction may predispose individuals to progression of lower tract disease and poor outcome.",

Several lead compounds are currently being evaluated (Nichols et al, 2008) , and a recently established volunteer infection model could speed up drug and vaccine development (Devincenzo et al, 2007) . In the past, it has been difficult to conduct randomized clinical trials for RSV in HCT recipients . However, the failure to complete these trials was directly linked to the level of complexity required to give aerosolized ribavirin . With novel antiviral compounds that are easy to administer, do not require hospitalization, and lack serious side effects it should be highly feasible to conduct clinical trials in the HCT setting.",
