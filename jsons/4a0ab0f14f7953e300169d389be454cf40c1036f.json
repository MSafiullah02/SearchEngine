Recently, two coronaviruses, rat coronavirus (RCV) (31) and sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) (4) from rats were shown to share a common antigen with MHV (4, 8) , and Bhatt et al (3) demonstrated that SDAV is also capable of causing respiratory infection in mice. While Bhatt and Jacoby (2) observed some differences in pathogenicity between SDAV and RCV, the speculation has arisen that MHV, and SDAV might be only variations within the murine coronaviruses which are transmissible between mice and rats. Recently, our routine serological surveillance revealed a high incidence of antibody to MHV in rat sera in Japan (11) .",

The present study demonstrated the propagation of MHV-A59 in suckling rats, and cerebral lesions were established, with brain virus titers of 107-108 PFU/0.2 g at maximum levels. The infected rats developed CNS symptoms such as trembling, spasms, ataxia, and convulsions. Virus-specific immunofluorescence was detected in neurons of the cerebral cortex. Anomalies in the brain were produced only with strain MHV-A59 of the nine strains tested. After i.e. inoculation of suckling rats with MHV-2, MHV-3, JHM, NuA, and NuU, 103 (or more) PFU of virus per 0.2 g were recovered from the brain but no brain lesions were produced. No virus was detectable after i.e. inoculation with MHV-1, MHV-S, and Nu66.",

Such lesions were produced only after i.e inoculation. Furthermore, 14-and 30-day-old rats were resistant to i.e. inoculation even with the administration of cortisone which is known to enhance MHV infection in mice (17, 18) . These results indicate that the malformation is produced only when rats less than 7 days old are inoculated with MHV-A59 by the i.e. route and that the age of the host and the route of infection are important for the development of hydrocephalus in rats, as reported for MHV-2 infection in mice (17) . Virus growth in the brain was parallel with the development of clinical signs, and virus-specific antigen was demonstrated in numerous neurons of the cerebral cortex by direct immunofluorescence. In addition, histopathological changes in the cortex were correlated with the presence of virus antigen detected by immunofluorescence.",

However, brain lesions could also be induced in suckling Fisher rats as in Wistar rats (unpublished data), suggesting that the virus could produce such a lesion in other strains of rat. Concerning MHV infection of the CNS, i.c. inoculation of the JHM strain into mice caused initial damage in oligodendroglia cells followed by demyelination, as reported by Lampart et al (23) , Weiner (36) , and Powell and Lampart (33) . Goto et al (13) demonstrated that mitral cells of olfactory bulbs were initially affected in weanling mice by i.n. infection. Recently, Nagashima et al (28) observed the development of demyelinating encephalitis in weanling rats after i.c. inoculation with the JHM strain and detected virus antigen in oligodendroglia cells by immunofluorescence. In the present study virus-specific fluorescence and maximum virus titers were observed in numerous neurons of the cortex during the early stage of infection; however, hydrocephalus was produced in the late stages, when virus was not detected. These observations indicate a difference in target cells and pathogenicity between the JHM and MHV-A59 strains.",

Influenza A in rhesus monkeys (24) , parainfluenza type 2 in hamsters (20) , reovirus type 1 in hamsters, ferrets, mice, and rats (22), Ross River virus (27) and Newcastle disease vaccine virus (7) in mice have also been shown to induce hydrocephalus. These experiments show that nonfatal infections with those viruses result in stenosis of the aqueduct leading to hydrosephalus. Recently, Norrby and Kristensson (30) reported that subacute encephalitis and hydrocephalus in hamsters were caused by measles virus released from persistently infected cell cultures, and that no definite lesion of the aqueduct was found in animals with hydrocephalus. In the present study aqueductal stenosis was not found in the affected animals, and it was thought possible that hydrocephalus was produced as a sequence to the destruction of immature developing nervous tissues by the virus.",
