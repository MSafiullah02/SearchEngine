            "text": "There are no available therapies, and the only way to prevent the virus spread is to regularly and thoroughly clean hands with an alcohol\u2010based hand gel or wash them with soap and water for minimum 20 seconds, to maintain at least 1 m distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing, to avoid touching eyes, nose, hair, ear, and mouth, and to stay home if one feels unwell. The best way to protect everybody against COVID\u201019 is done by frequently cleaning the hands. By doing this; we eliminate the viruses that may be on our hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching our eyes, mouth, and nose. Some antiseptics such as alcohol or chlorine can try to kill the viruses that have already entered our body. But these substances can be harmful to clothes or mucosal surfaces including eyes and mouth. Soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses. Soap dissolves the fat membrane, and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and \u201cdies,\u201d or rather, it becomes inactive as viruses are not really alive. Viruses can be active outside the body for hours, even days. Disinfectants, or liquids, wipes, gels, and creams containing alcohol have a similar effect but are not as good as regular soap. Apart from alcohol and soap, antibacterial agents in those products do not affect the virus structure much. Consequently, many antibacterial products are just an expensive version of soap for virus killing. Soap is the best, but alcohol wipes are good when soap is not practical or handy, for example, in office reception areas. Soap contains fat\u2010like substances known as amphiphiles, structurally similar to the lipids in the virus membrane. The soap molecules \u201ccompete\u201d with the lipids in the virus membrane. That is more or less how soap also removes the normal dirt of the skin. The soap molecules also compete with a lot of other non\u2010covalent bonds that help the proteins, RNA and the lipids to stick together. The soap is effectively \u201cdissolving\u201d the glue that holds the virus together. When you add to that all the water it is even better. The soap also outcompetes the interactions between the virus and the skin surface. Soon the virus gets detached and falls apart like a house of cards due to the combined action of the soap and the water.\n2\n\n",

Ethanol and other types of alcohol do not only readily form hydrogen bonds with the virus material but, as a solvent, are more lipophilic than water. Hence, alcohol does dissolve the lipid membrane and disrupt other supramolecular interactions of the virus. However, you need a fairly high concentration (may be 60%\u2010plus) of the alcohol to get a rapid dissolution of the virus. To sum up, viruses are almost like grease\u2010nanoparticles. They can stay active for many hours on surfaces and then get picked up by touch. Then they get to our face and infect us because most of us touch our face frequently. Water is not effective alone in washing the virus off our hands. Alcohol\u2010based products work better. But nothing beats soap\u2014the virus detaches from the skin and falls apart readily in soapy water. Supramolecular chemistry and nanoscience tell us not only a lot about how the virus self\u2010assembles into a functional, active menace, but also how we can beat viruses with something as simple as soap.\n3\n\n",

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have antiviral activity against COVID\u201019 in vitro and in small uncontrolled clinical studies with limited and inconclusive results. In COVID\u201019, a small non\u2010randomized study from France indicated some benefits with serious methodological flaws, and a follow\u2010up study still lacked a control group. However, another very small, randomized study from China in patients with mild to moderate COVID\u201019 found no difference in recovery rates. Sadly, reports of adverse events have increased, with several countries reporting side\u2010effects including ventricular arrhythmias, QT prolongation, other cardiac toxicities, ocular toxicity, and even death. We should know that these drugs may pose particular risk to critically ill persons. Due to the remarkable pharmacokinetics and efficacy, azithromycin with immunomodulatory and anti\u2010inflammatory properties, is well established as a potent treatment for some skin diseases such as rosacea, psoriasis, and synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. Combining hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin has also been associated with positive patient outcomes according to low\u2010powered France study.\n10\n Whether this results in better clinical outcomes\u2014that is, if patients recover more quickly\u2014is still being debated.",

But the most important thing is that we have to work together as a professional community to support one another, therefore upcoming challenges will undoubtedly create learning experiences for us all. Literature knowledge suggests that humans have been afflicted by viruses throughout their evolutionary history, although the number and the types have changed. Endogenous retroviral insertions since the divergence between humans and chimpanzees were capable of directly affecting hominid evolution through changes in gene expression and development. It is estimated that there are about 1031 viruses on Earth and most of the viruses are bacteriophages, and most of them are in the oceans. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project has revealed the presence of numerous viral DNA sequences scattered throughout the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome. These sequences make up around 8% of human DNA, and appear to be the remains of ancient https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus infections of human ancestors. These pieces of DNA have firmly established themselves in human DNA. Most of this DNA is no longer functional, but some of these friendly viruses have brought with them novel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene that are important in human development.12, 13 Questions remain regarding that COVID\u201019 pandemia is whether or not a major driver of human evolution.",
