The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently classified carbapenem resistant A. baumannii as a top priority organism for research and development of new antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant bacteria [1]. The occurrence of A. baumannii in Pakistan was first reported in 2004, where it counted for 4.4% of the Gram-negative bacilli in a collection of 812 isolates obtained from a variety of clinical samples in Rawalpindi in 2002 [2]. Importantly, 72% of the reported A. baumannii isolates were found to be extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Later, eight clusters of carbapenem-resistant isolates of A. baumannii were detected in two intensive care units in Karachi, Pakistan, between November 2007 and August 2008 [3]. Concurrently, A. baumannii was the most frequent bacterial pathogen among a collection of 50 carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates obtained in Rawalpindi in 2009 [4]. According to Kaleem et al., twenty-seven (84%) of the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates were metallo-beta-lactamase positive by the E-test strip method.",

A. baumannii also ranked the second most commonly detected pathogen (24.7%) among a collection of carbapenemase producers obtained from one hospital in Lahore between 2015 and 2016 [6]. Furthermore, A. baumannii was the main isolated bacterium (39.8%) among a total of 113 isolates recovered from 80 ventilator-supported patients at the Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi, in 2016 [7].",

            "text": "Nevertheless, only few of these studies have plotted the epidemiology of A. baumannii in Pakistan onto a global map. Most of the 2007\u20132008 hospital-acquired carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii belonged to either International clone (IC) I or II [3]. Similarly, 1/17 and 7/17 clinical isolates of A. baumannii, obtained in 2008, were linked to ICs I and II, respectively [8]. Two isolates collected in Norway in 2009 with a history of import from Pakistan were assigned to sequence types 2 (ST2) and ST15, using the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme of Pasteur Institute [9, 10]. ST2 is a key member of IC II while ST15 has often been reported in South America [11, 12]. Our search in the A. baumannii MLST databases yielded records of 4 isolates from Pakistan (last accessed in 11 September 2019). The 4 isolates were entered in 2019, which might explain why we could not find published literature on them. Two of these isolates belonged to ST1310 (8, 1, 5, 1, 6, 2, 3) or ST1327 (13, 1, 5, 26, 7, 1, 29), for which there was no linkage to known ICs. The other two isolates belonged to ST1106 (2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1), a member of clonal complex CC1 corresponding to IC I [11].",

The geographic distance between the two hospitals is about 520 kilometres (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The isolates were cultured from pus (n = 17), respiratory secretions (n = 27), intravenous catheter tip (n = 5), Foley catheter tip (n = 2), and bile (n = 1). The clinical samples were processed according to standard in-house culture protocols. When needed, isolates were revived from frozen glycerol stocks onto Brain Heart Infusion agar plates or slants (Oxoid, Basingstoke, United Kingdom). Species identification was first determined using API 20 NE (BioMerieux, France) and later confirmed by detecting occurrence of the intrinsic blaOXA-51-like gene in all the isolates [13]. The identification was further verified by partial rpoB (zone 1, 352 bp) gene sequence analysis in 25 isolates selected for whole-genome sequencing [14].",

This deviation revealed an inherent shortage in the current numbering system of the blaOXA genes [32, 33].

The distinction between Ab-Pak-cludters-6A and -6B was also confirmed. The six isolates of Ab-Pak-cluster-1 were distributed on two detached branches and a few sub-branches. Such a high discriminatory power of whole-genome phylogenetic analyses, compared to loci-focused strain typing approaches, has been noted in previous studies [36, 37]. Nevertheless, the internal splits in Ab-Pak-cluster-1 were most likely related to a long-standing presence of this cluster. In addition, the tree showed a noticeably well-demarcated positioning of Ab-Pak-cluster-7 far from ICs I and II. Sequencing the whole genome of more isolates, especially from Ab-Pak-cluster-1, would have increased our capacity to confirm or exclude transmission events between patients [38].

Both K50 and AA-014 belonged to ST158 [40, 41]. K50 was recovered from a hospitalized patient in Kuwait in 2008, while AA-014 was collected from a wound specimen in Iraq in 2008. Additional two isolates, 2226C and ABC002, were assigned into ST158 according to the MLST database (https://pubmlst.org/abaumannii/). 2226C was isolated in Turkey in 2009 while ABC002 was collected in Egypt in 2011 (https://pubmlst.org/). ST158 isolates were also reported in Lebanon between 2011 and 2013 [42]. The recognition of Ab-Pak-cluster-7 in Pakistan has then expanded the geographic distribution of ST158 beyond the Middle East [43\u201346].",

However, further validation of the results is commonly needed. The occurrence of a 100% rate of multidrug-resistant strains is alarming and worth a rapid action plan, including regular follow ups and urgent management procedures. The study enabled us to detect seven clusters of A. baumannii prevailing in two clinical settings in Pakistan. Two of these clusters, Ab-Pak-cluster-1 and -6, lasted for more than 2 years and were able to spread between Lahore and Peshawar. The predominance of IC II in Pakistan was in line with the intensive circulation of this clone worldwide (11). The frequent occurrence of isolates belonging to IC I underlined that this clone is still a key trouble-maker in several parts of the world, including Pakistan. Significantly, Pakistan and the Middle East could be a reservoir for under-detected clones of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, including the blaOXA-23- and blaGES-11-positive ST158. The clinical significance and virulence features of ST158, represented by Ab-Pak-cluster-7 in Pakistan, is worth further investigations.",
