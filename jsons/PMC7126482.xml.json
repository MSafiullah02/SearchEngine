Their leaves and roots known as Daqingye and Banlangen, respectively, have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for hundreds of years as antipyretic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-influenza agents [1], [2]. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both Daqingye and Banlangen were prescribed to treat patients in China although there was no medical evidence suggesting their applicability. Since then, they have become two of the most popular TCMs.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, more than 50 chemical constituents have been identified in Daqinye and Banlangen including alkaloids [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], sucrose [5], [6], organic acids [3], [10], and glycosides [7], [9]. Among them, three alkaloids are selected as the markers for quality control in this paper due to their unique pharmaceutical activities: tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin (Fig. 1\n). Tryptanthrin, or indolo-[2,1-b]-quinozoline-6,12-dione, is an indoloquinazoline alkaloid that strongly inhibits cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) in cellular assays (IC50 64 nm in Mono Mac 6 cells) [11]. It was reported that tryptanthrin is also a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor in vitro-pharmacological investigations [12]. Indigo and indirubin are structural isomers. Indigo is one of the oldest natural blue dye stuffs and had been used by the Asians to color artificial crafts until synthetic indigo was marketed at the end of last century. However, indigo is more than just a natural pigment since Sugihara et al. demonstrated that both indigo and indirubin have physiological effects on liver microsomes in mice [13]. They also possess the property of inducing ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) as well as methoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (MROD) activities and the influence is mediated by the hydrocarbon receptor. In addition, indigo derivates and indirubin have been proven to have curative effects on anti-cancer drugs in humans and chronic leukemia inhibitors in mice [14], [15]. Most recently, indirubin has been shown to inhibit the chemokine regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) [16].",

By integrating it with the technique of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), we propose the use of LC-APCI-MS to quantify the amounts of the three active components contained in Daqingye and Balangen. In other words, the main objective of this paper is to employ the new method in the SIM scan mode to simultaneously evaluate tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin as the marker standards for quality control of related herbs. To validate its effectiveness, our approach will be applied to fresh and dried leaves of some dye plants.",

A close look at the amounts of the three ingredients contained in the leaves before and after drying reveals no noticeable change for tryptanthrin.

This is consistent with the observation of Kokubun et al. that the indigo content of Isatis tinctoria reduced by 67% when the fresh leaves were dried [24]. In contrast, more indirubin was found and increased four-folds in the dried leaves than in the fresh leaves.
