            "text": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare clinical syndrome of excessive immune activation, characterized by signs and symptoms of extreme inflammation, driven mainly by interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our understanding of HLH pathogenesis has significantly evolved in the past two decades. Though there are varied molecular etiologies, genetic HLH disorders most often develop due to either defective lymphocyte cytotoxicity or abnormal inflammasome activity. Defects in lymphocyte cytotoxicity due to perforin deficiency or degranulation defects lead to prolonged synapse times, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, and abnormal reciprocal activation of mononuclear phagocytes and cytotoxic NK cells and T cells. Activated mononuclear phagocytes promote hemophagocytosis and release of HLH biomarkers like ferritin, CXCL9, and IL-18BP. SAP deficiency uniquely impairs restimulation-induced cell death and, like CD27 and CD70 deficiency, prevents normal killing of EBV-infected B cells. The absence of XIAP permits pathogenic NLRP3 inflammasome activity and abnormal lymphocyte apoptosis, while activating mutations in NLRC4 drive pathologic NLRC4 inflammasome activity [1\u20136].",

            "text": "The current diagnostic criteria for HLH include either a genetic HLH diagnosis or five of the following eight clinical and/or laboratory criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis, low or absent NK cell activity, elevated ferritin, and elevated sIL-2 receptor (sIL2R) (Table 1) [7]. The most commonly affected organs are the liver, spleen, central nervous system (CNS), and bone marrow. HLH is a syndrome with a variable clinical presentation, requiring comprehensive clinical evaluation to rule out other disorders and clinical syndromes, as clinical diagnostic criteria are not specific and there is considerable overlap with other conditions [8\u201311]. We present a group of patients referred to our center for the management of HLH, who also had a simultaneous presentation of clinically significant thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA is an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome that results from vascular endothelial injury and may occur in the setting of excessive inflammation such as that seen following a toxic injury (spider or snake bite, radiation, or chemotherapy), in highly inflammatory diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and after stem cell transplantation (TA-TMA) or solid organ transplant [12]. TMA presents with a constellation of laboratory features and a specific pattern of organ injury [13]. TMA diagnostic criteria include either a histologic diagnosis on tissue biopsy of microangiopathic changes or at least five of the seven laboratory and clinical markers listed in Table 1. If not recognized, TMA can progress to multi-organ failure. Complement system dysregulation is a known pathogenic pathway leading to TMA, and complement blocking agents are used therapeutically with some success [14]. However, other inflammatory pathways may contribute to the endothelial injury that initiate and sustain TMA, and can likely be targeted to improve clinical outcomes further [15, 16].",

            "text": "We observed a high incidence of clinically significant complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) associated with multi-organ injury in children and young adults with a diagnosis of HLH. TMA has not been previously associated with interferon gamma-driven diseases like HLH [26], but TMA has been reported as an iatrogenic therapy-limiting side effect in patients receiving interferon alpha and beta therapy [27\u201331]. We hypothesized that high levels of interferon gamma in HLH might contribute directly to endothelial damage or injure endothelium through complement system activation. Our previous gene expression analysis in autologous stem cell recipients showed upregulation of interferon-responsive complement genes at the onset of TA-TMA that resolved after therapy with complement blocking agent eculizumab [32]. High levels of IFN\u03b3 promote the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), leading to complement activation via complement factor P (CFP) [33]. Terminal complement activation resulting in vascular endothelial injury is one of the important pathogenic pathways leading to high-risk TMA with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Uncontrolled terminal complement activation can maintain IFN\u03b3 secretion via intracellular C5a receptor production resulting in a cycle of continuing tissue injury [34]. Vascular endothelium injured by terminal complement can secrete interferons in addition to the robust production of IFN\u03b3 by activated T cells, NK cells, and macrophages in patients with immune over-activation syndromes like HLH. While both interferons and complement are essential components of our immune response, over-activation of these pathways results in organ injury as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d during high inflammatory states as seen in HLH and TMA.",

In this study, complement gene variants were more common in HLH subjects with TMA then those without TMA (7/9, 78% vs 0/8, 0%, p = 0.0023). The median number of complement variants detected in these 7 HSCT recipients with HLH was 2 (range 1\u20135), and all patients with complement variants identified had severe TMA and multi-organ injury with an elevated blood sC5b-9 level indicating terminal complement over-activation. Transplant-related mortality was also significantly higher in HLH patients with TMA with six patients of the 9 patients dying from TMA-associated complications, while all HLH patients without TMA survived after transplant (6/9 67% vs 0/8, 0%, p = 0.09) [35]. Based on this prior observation, it is possible that patients with HLH who have complement gene variants in addition to the genetic defects of their primary disease may be more prone to rapid complement activation during active HLH, and may have more severe organ damage resulting from both interferon and complement co-injury of endothelial cells. Prompt control of over-activation of the interferon and complement systems is likely needed for successful resolution of both clinical conditions, HLH and TMA. Our study was limited by small sample size, so we were unable to perform any statistical analysis confirming benefit of eculizumab therapy in subjects with TMA. However, all patients with HLH and TMA who received the complement blocker eculizumab with the IFN\u03b3 blocker emapalumab recovered and are doing well, supporting further investigation of this approach. Such targeted therapies can only be successfully applied if these co-existent hyperinflammatory conditions are appropriately recognized.",
