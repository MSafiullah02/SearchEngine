            "text": "As a result of the growing concern on inhalation exposure to airborne particulate matter indoors, many studies have been conducted focusing on epidemiology (Williams et al., 2000), toxicology (Weichenthal et al., 2007), deposition (Lai, 2002) and transport (Gao and Niu, 2007; Li et al., 2007). Twenty-first century bioterrorism has created the urgent need for intensive review of potential countermeasures. Infectious biological agents are on the order of 1000\u20131 million times more hazardous than chemical agents (Brown, 2004). Aerosolized bacteria or viruses might be used to attack the occupants of a building. Proper understanding of aerosol dynamic behaviors in terms of mixing time and dispersion characteristics is vital to decide the positioning of sensors for air toxics (Gadgil et al., 2003). In addition, understanding of aerosol dispersion and transport is very important in prevention of nosocomial transmission of airborne pathogens (Cole and Cook, 1998; Li et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2007). After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in South East Asia in 2003, there is increasing research interest in studying the transport and control of airborne bacteria or viruses indoors (Beggs et al., 2006; Nicas et al., 2005) and in confined environment like aircraft cabins (Mangili and Gendreau, 2005).",

            "text": "One of the crucial features of aerosols is that their inertia effect and diffusion coefficient are size dependent. Unlike gases, particles usually cannot be assumed as passive contaminants, i.e. assumed to follow the airflow movement identically under the influence of advection and diffusion, due to some inherent properties of particles (Chang et al., 2006). Particle mass and deposition are among the most important characteristics that distinguish particles from gases and both of the two parameters become increasingly dominant as particle size increases. There are various factors influencing the distribution and deposition of indoor particles. The ventilation system determines airflow patterns in buildings, but it is not the sole factor affecting aerosol transport. A recent study also shows that 3 \u03bcm particle concentration in a chamber exhibits inhomogeneity that can be attributed to turbulent diffusion (Richmond-Bryant et al., 2006). The present authors also show that compared to the submicron droplets, 10 \u03bcm expiratory droplets exhibit different dispersion and transport characteristics under a displacement ventilation scheme (Lai and Cheng, 2007). Hence, to gain more knowledge on the distribution of particles, and exposure or intake dose, it is crucial to consider the influence of aerosol size.",

In reality, human exposure in a multi-zone environment is very common. For residential environments, very often pollutant sources are confined to one zone, e.g., cooking or smoking in a specific room, and the pollutants are subsequently transported and dispersed to the other zones. Previous studies on aerosol particle transport and deposition in multi-zone rooms have been carried out by Lagrangian simulations (Chung, 1999) or material-balance models (Miller and Nazaroff, 2001). However, few quantitative studies of particle deposition and distribution in ventilated multi-zone rooms have been reported in the literature.",

Indoor air quality and health-risk exposure assessment usually treat indoor microenvironments as well-mixed micro-compartments where the concentrations of particles are determined by a simple material-balance principle (Nardell, 1998; Nicas et al., 2005).

Prior to this, the numerical model was experimentally validated. Measurement of the particle dispersion profile in a two-zone environment has not been reported in the literature previously. In this work it was measured by a non-intrusive optical technique, phase Doppler Anemometry. It is based on light-scattering interferometry and therefore requires no calibration.

The drift\u2013flux model developed by the present authors (Chen et al., 2006) was used to model the particle distribution. The advantage of this approach is the feasibility of incorporating other external forces, e.g., electrostatic forces (Wang and Lai, 2006) into the model. Due to the low volume fraction of particles in the indoor air, it was assumed that particle motion does not modify air turbulence. The RNG k\u2013\u03b5 model was used to simulate the three-dimensional turbulent airflow field and the governing equation for the airflow field can be written in the general form as(1)\u2202\u2202t(\u03c1\u03d5)+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u\u03d5)=\u2207\u00b7(\u0393\u03d5\u2207\u03d5)+S\u03d5,where u is the velocity vector, \u03d5 represents each of the three velocity components, u, v, w. \u0393\u03d5 is the effective diffusion coefficient for each dependent variable.

It is understood that the Reynolds number, based on the inlet conditions, is quite low (Re=600), it is the Reynolds number used as a scaling criterion (Posner et al., 2003). Since the key objective of this paper is to validate and apply the drift\u2013flux model, the airflow parameters we selected are not critical. A small chamber with the same dimensions was fabricated. The thickness of the partition wall was ignored in the simulation. The room air was clean at the beginning and particles were supplied at a constant rate with the incoming air. The steady-state airflow characteristics and particle concentration were measured by a phase Doppler Anemometer (Dantec, Denmark). Olive oil droplets generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer (EU-12, Omron, Japan) were used for velocity measurement. For concentration measurement, solid particles were injected with a solid particle disperser (RBG-1000, Palas, Germany), which is able to maintain a stable particle feed rate over a long time period. The concentration of silver-coated hollow glass sphere particles (Dantec) with a nominal diameter of 10 \u03bcm was measured by the PDA. A particle passing through the sample volume scatters light that exhibits an angular and temporal intensity distribution characteristic of the particle size and velocity. Particle size and velocity can be determined by analyzing the scattering light with a signal processor. The sample volume has a nominal diameter <100 \u03bcm and, therefore, the PDA system is able to achieve point and non-intrusive measurement. The particle number concentration is a derived, not a directly measured, quantity in a PDA measurement. Particle concentration was evaluated with the transit-time-based algorithm as discussed by Hardalupas and Taylor (1989). In order to measure steady-state particle concentration, the fan and particle disperser were switched on for at least 15 min before data acquisition. Each test was conducted three times to give the averaged result.",

The concentrations have been measured at breathing height for each zone. The breathing height can be estimated based on the ratio H\nb\u00d7(H\nm/H\nr) where H\nb, H\nm and H\nr are breathing height (1.625 m), model room height (0.4 m) and the typical room height (2.5 m), respectively. The locations selected are (x=0.2, y=0.2, z=0.26) and (x=0.6, y=0.2, z=0.26) for zones 1 and 2, respectively. Results obtained by the well-mixed model are depicted for comparison. The concentration level in zone 1 decreases exponentially. At this sampling point (breathing height), the well-mixed model predicts a slower decrease compared to the drift\u2013flux model. Besides the advection process, the overall particle decay rate is augmented by the low vertical mixing rate. It is shown in Fig. 5(a)\u2013(c) that the upward dispersion rate is low and hence at the breathing height, the concentration is low. For the well-mixed model, the concentration in the entire zone is always uniform. For zone 2, the concentration profile at the breathing height increases to reach a peak and then starts to decay. For all particle sizes shown here, there is a very low concentration during the first 60 s at the breathing height. This differs significantly from the well-mixed model prediction. The lag time to reach the peak concentration also varies notably between the two models, 180\u2013240 s for the drift\u2013flux model and 60\u2013180 s for the well-mixed analytical model. The peak concentration levels predicted by the drift\u2013flux simulation are always less than those predicted by the well-mixed model. In summary, due to the underlying homogeneous assumption, the well-mixed model underestimates the breathing height concentration in zone 1 and, more significantly, it severely overestimates the concentration in zone 2 for 0\u2013120 s. The decay rates predicted by the both models also differ. Particles may be trapped in stagnant regions and cannot be removed instantly, so a smaller decay rate is thus predicted. The well-mixed model cannot account for this stagnation phenomenon. One crucial parameter for IAQ assessment is the exposure (or dose). We present the normalized accumulated exposure (\u222b0TC+dt) versus time for the first 6 min. The accumulated exposures (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) are calculated based on numerical integration of the corresponding concentration profiles as shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7.",

The initial simulation exposure is low, but the trend is increasing with time. For all particle sizes presented, the predictions by the well-mixed model are always higher than those predicted by the drift\u2013flux simulation. This can be explained by the trend observed in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 in which the exposure predicted by simulation is always higher. By conservation of mass, the accumulated exposure in zone 2 must show the opposite trend as observed in Fig. 6, Fig. 7.

            "text": "A new Eulerian drift\u2013flux model has been applied to simulate particle dispersion and exposure in a two-zone geometry. A phase Doppler Anemometer has been utilized to measure airflow and concentration profiles. Aerosol profiles in a two-zone environment have not been experimentally measured before. Good agreement between the numerical model and the experiment demonstrates that the drift\u2013flux model can be used to predict aerosol deposition and transport in ventilated multi-zone rooms. With the same ventilation rate, the distributions of particles in the two zones are significantly different. Gravity plays a dominant role in the transport of supermicron particles and large supermicron particles which deposit significantly faster than smaller particles. The current drift\u2013flux model predicts that particles are not uniformly distributed in either zone. A well-mixed model based on the mass balance equation was also used to evaluate the profiles of concentration and exposure for the two-zone environment. The well-mixed assumption does not always hold, particularly for supermicron particles. The drift\u2013flux model can be expanded to incorporate more external forces (thermal gradient, surface roughness, etc.) and be further applied to more realistic environments, e.g., furnished rooms with multi-sources.",
