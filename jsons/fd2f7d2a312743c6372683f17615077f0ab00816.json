In response, the United States Department of Homeland Defense has planned for a future attack by formulating multiple scenarios which may occur in the event of such a disaster. Radiology will play a key role in each of these scenarios, assisting with triage, diagnosis, and therapy of the large populations which potentially could be involved. This article describes some of these scenarios as well the response which will be expected of the radiology community in the event of such a disaster.",

These scenarios include different blast, biological, chemical, nuclear, and natural disasters. Radiology has a significant role in many of these scenarios because it stands at the crossroads of screening, decontamination, diagnosis, treatment planning, and perhaps long-term patient care.",

Most of the buildings within 1,000 m (\u223c3,200 ft) of the detonation will be severely damaged. Subsequent injuries from flying debris (missiles) will possibly be observed out to 6 km (\u223c3.7 miles) [1] . Patients will present primarily with burns to exposed skin and eyes (flash burns), projectile, crush, and translational injuries ( Fig. 1 ) as well as acute radiation syndrome [1] . Gas-filled organs such as the ears, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract will be the most vulnerable to the blast effect, with lung injury as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Individuals directly exposed to the radiation will result in additional long-term health care sequelae. Many of these victims will have an increased future risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms. Of these malignancies, leukemia is the most likely; however, some patients may also develop thyroid, breast, lung, or salivary gland cancer [2] . In addition to providing immediate trauma imaging assistance, radiologists may be asked to provide expert advice in concert with a health physicist (if available) to assist with radiation detection, patient triage, decontamination, and management of the victims of acute radiation syndrome.",

Casualties in this scenario are estimated at approximately 180 fatalities, 270 injuries, and 20,000 detectible personal contaminations (at each exposed site).

In addition, cesium-137 is particularly dangerous if accidentally ingested or inhaled as it is readily absorbed by the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that approximately 200 \u03bcCi of inhaled cesium-137 would result in an approximately 5-rem exposure (10 CFR Appendix B to part 20). Given the variability in weather, as well as exposure conditions, doses up to 543 rem have been estimated by this particular route [12] , with decreasing exposure with greater distance. Despite the dangers which cesium-137 poses to those directly within the blast area, the majority of patients presenting to medical facilities, however, would likely present due to psychosomatic illness brought on by widespread public panic from radiation exposure assuming they were outside the immediate area of exposure and considering weather patterns within the area at the time of the exposure. Finally, the long-term effects of a radiation detonation within the affected population (i.e., increased risk of cancers) would depend upon the cumulative exposure of the population, which would be based upon the amount of aerosolized and surface contamination as well as proximity to the epicenter of the blast [1] . In this final scenario, IEDs would be detonated inside a large sports arena, as well as a parking facility near the entertainment complex, with an additional series of devices to be detonated in the lobby of the nearest hospital emergency department. Injuries will result from structural collapse, secondary and tertiary blast effects, exposure to products of combustion, thermal effects, and possible crowd surge at the complex. There will be loss of traffic controls within the area, and fleeing citizens would subsequently cause multiple traffic accidents which will further worsen the situation [1] .",

Secondary injuries are due to objects being propelled directly outward by the force of the explosion, producing patterns of injury similar to the orthopedic and penetrating types often observed in patients following the impaction of a motor vehicle accident.
