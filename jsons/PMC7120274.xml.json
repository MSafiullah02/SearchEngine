The gap between their behaviour and the recommendations addressed to them is often interpreted as a lack of knowledge or a problem of perception. On the contrary, we will focus in this chapter on the active role of farmers in risk management and on the constraints, opportunities, values and interests that underpin their behaviours. The purpose is to understand the logic of disease management at the local scale. We apply this approach to the case of poultry farmers facing H5N1 in a village in Vietnam.",

Furthermore, to satisfy the resumption of consumer demand, the Vietnamese government reduced import taxes on poultry from 2006 onwards, generating a new situation of competition for locally produced poultry [taxes were reduced by between 20 % and 60 % depending on the product category (Tuong 2010).

It is an important production area for poultry destined for the Vietnamese domestic market. Duyen Yet is a village in this province, sitting in a bend of the Red River. Before 1993, most of the inhabitants of this village derived their livelihoods from small-scale agriculture (essentially rice) and pig farming. From 1993 onwards, a highly proactive government policy encouraged the zone to specialise in poultry production. A state farm was set up in Dai Xuyen in a neighbouring parish to provide farmers with day-old chickens (DOCs) with a view to rearing broilers. The state farm subsequently encouraged the diversification of poultry farming activities in the area by also supplying parental chicks for the production of chicks and ducklings. In the village of Duyen Yet, the production of chickens which had been developed was for the most part quickly replaced by the production of chicks and ducklings with the installation of several private hatcheries. At the start of the new millennium, a land reorganisation policy enabled the creation of farms devoted to fish farming and intensive poultry farming in the lower parts of the village, thanks to major earthmoving works (allowing the raising of ground for the houses and rearing pens to be built). These farms are called \u201cbreeding farms\u201d as opposed to \u201cvillage farms\u201d.",

Half of them have a park adjacent to the poultry house thereby enabling the farmers to rear Muscovy ducks (these last ones are considered as too dirty to be kept in confinement). A small proportion of them (5\u201310 %) have an adjacent body of water enabling them to rear Peking ducks.

Because the broilers\u2019 production cycle is short (45 days for white chickens, 3 months for red chickens) compared to laying hens, the farmers produce several batches per year and therefore devote more time during the year to the young chicks, making it a labour-intensive activity.

As a result of all these considerations, this activity is deemed suitable for farmers with little experience or limited capital.\nDay-old chickens (DOC): These chicks are intended for the production of broilers.

Fertilised eggs are incubated either in private hatcheries within the parish or, in the case of almost half of the breeding farms, in hatcheries of the state farms. The hatcheries also act as intermediaries when marketing the chicks (sold to the nearby provinces of Hai Phong and Quang Ninh). Often, the hatchery lends the farmer the money required to purchase the chicks and the feed (in particular, in the case of laying hens when the farmer must wait 6 months before selling the first chicks. In the hatchery we visited, the owner informed us that he offered credit to half of his customers). Broilers and discard layers are sold to the numerous collectors who operate within the village and supply the Ha Vi wholesale market through which passes almost half the chickens supply to the city of Hanoi (Agrifood Consulting International 2007). The farmers are thus integrated into value chains which are geographically limited to northern Vietnam and in which no economic stakeholder would appear to enjoy any marked domination.

Data from the Ministry of Agriculture (Division of Animal Health) confirm a relatively low risk of infection associated with the H5N1 virus, ranging from 0.8 % to 6.5 % at the level of the communes (for the last four of the six waves of the virus). However, the relative incidence of H5N1 and other contagious diseases is difficult to assess in that we do not have data concerning the mortality rates of poultry before the emergence of the H5N1 virus or their causes. The Agrifood Consulting data are based on farmers\u2019 declarations and therefore primarily indicate that, in the opinion of the latter, the H5N1 virus (rightly or wrongly) plays only a secondary role in poultry infections (vaccination of poultry against H5N1 has moreover modified the clinical picture and made it more difficult to recognise an outbreak of H5N1) or that the farmers have no interest in declaring cases of flu within their farms.",

We have already explained that farmers increase the number of species raised to cope with the hazards of the market. Ducks are considered to be less sensitive than chickens to the H5N1 virus. To what extent did avian flu influence the choice of these species? The answers vary considerably: In several cases, the activity was renewed with broilers as they follow a rapid production cycle and the return on investment is quick. However, according to certain farmers, there are fewer broiler chicken farms following the outbreak of avian flu because chickens are more sensitive to the virus and farmers do not want to vaccinate animals with a relatively short cycle. Some farmers believe it is more judicious to rear red chickens rather than white chickens and Peking ducks rather than Muscovy ducks because they are less vulnerable. Others feel that the market is currently highly favourable to Muscovy ducks, thereby explaining why some farmers opt for this species. In light of this wide range of arguments, it is difficult to identify a clear trend in terms of the choice of species; the predominant strategy remains the diversification of species: \u201cDucks are more resilient than Muscovy ducks and the vaccination of ducks against avian flu is more efficient.7 During an outbreak of the flu, it is therefore better to keep ducks. But people continue to combine the two\u201d.",

This study shows that farmers in the village studied \u2013 and who are in the front line of the issue \u2013 have considered it as such only during a short period of time, when they feared for their own health. But this fear was transitory, and the problem related to H5N1 only persisted for them, in a much subdued form, as an epizootic disease (transmission from animal to animal) with direct and indirect consequences (economic and regulatory impacts). The pandemic potential (transmission from person to person on a global scale) or even zoonotic dimension (transmission between man and animal) of the virus which justified the international concern does not figure in the local framing of the disease.",

There are numerous other poultry diseases. The economic impact of H5N1 has been however quite specific due to the new regulations adopted by the government to face it (under international pressure), but this impact was limited if we consider the context of a generally unstable market. In the past, farmers developed strategies, which they once again called on in the context of the avian flu outbreaks. These strategies aim more to minimise the indirect effects of the disease (i.e. strategies of alleviation) than to avoid the disease itself (i.e. strategies of prevention and precaution) and would appear to have been relatively successful, at the scale of the village.",

Similarly, avian flu has been responsible for a national and international crisis: avian flu outbreaks encouraged to revise scientific knowledge on the ecology of viruses (in particular with regard to ducks); to review the governance, in particular international health governance; to design new decision-making process in situations of uncertainty; and to rethink the relations of the Vietnamese authorities with the international community, but at the level of the farms in the village concerned by the study, the reaction was limited to a half-hearted criticism of the government (within the limits of what is possible within the country) for what was perceived as excessive communication concerning the flu (and the negative impact that this had on consumption) and on its decision to lower taxes on imported poultry.8\n",

Our contribution is to show that this dynamic takes place at different levels, from local to international, mobilising different framings of the disease. These framings evolve with time, with periods of alignment and divergences. These divergences may lead to competing answers to the problem.",
