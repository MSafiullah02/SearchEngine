Based on the X-ray structure (PDB code: 6LU7), ligands were generated using a multimodal structure-based design and then docked to the monomer in the active state. Docking calculations show that ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases. The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement.",

The new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2 and believed to have a zoonotic origin, has infected thus far about 2450000 people worldwide with thousands in critical conditions, causing the death of 166000 people.

            "text": "Most of the Coronaviridae genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and, through ribosomal frameshifting during translation [5] , pp1ab. These polyproteins are cleaved and transformed in mature non-structural proteins (NSPs) by the two proteases 3CL pro (3C-like protease) and PL pro (Papain Like Protease) encoded by the open reading frame 1 [6] . NSPs, in turn, play a fundamental role in the transcription/replication during the infection [5] . Targeting these proteases may hence constitute a valid approach for antiviral drug design. The catalytically active 3CL pro is a dimer. Cleavage by 3CL pro occurs at the glutamine residue in the P1 position of the substrate via the protease CYS-HIS dyad in which the cysteine thiol functions as the nucleophile in the proteolytic process [7] . While dimerization is believed to provide a substratebinding cleft between the two monomers [8] , in the dimer the solventexposed CYS-HYS dyads are symmetrically located at the opposite edges the cleft, probably acting independently [9] . As no host-cell proteases are currently known with this specificity, early drug discovery was directed towards the so-called covalent Michael inhibitors [10] , via electrophilic attack to the cysteinyl residue. On the other hand, the consensus in drug discovery leads to excluding electrophiles from drug candidates for reasons relating to safety and adverse effects such as allergies, tissue destruction, or carcinogenesis [11] .",

The substrate-binding pockets of two coronavirus main proteases are compared in Fig. 1b T opening gate for the substrate in the active state [12] . Fig. 1 (a,b) strongly suggest that effective non-covalent inhibitors for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases should share the same structural and chemical features. In order to investigate this matter, we have performed a molecular modeling study on both the 6LU7 and 1UK4 structures. 6LU7 is the monomer of the main protease in the active state with the N3 peptidomimetic inhibitor [15] while 1UK4 is the dimer with the protomer chain A in the active state [12] . The main protease monomer contains three domains. Domains I and II (residues 8-101 and 102-184) are made of antiparallel -barrel structures in a chymotrypsin-like fold responsible for catalysis [16] .",

Ligands in LIGANN are generated so as to match the shape and chemical attributes of the binding pocket and decoded into a sequence of SMILES enabling directly the structurebased de novo drug design. SMILES codes for ligands were obtained using the default LIGANN values for shapes and channels with the cubic box center set at the midpoint vector connecting the SH and NE atoms of the CYS-HIS dyad in the 6LU7 structure. The PlayMolecule interface delivered 93 optimally fit non-congeneric compounds, spanning a significant portion of the chemical space, whose SMILES and structures are reported in the Supporting Information (SI). Each of these compounds was docked to the 6LU7 and to the 1UK4 structures, using Autodock4 [19] with full ligand flexibility. For both structures, the docking was repeated by setting the dyad with the residue in their neutral (CYS-HIS) and charged state (CYS \u2212 /HIS + ).

Correlation is still high when ligand binding free energies for the main proteases are compared, confirming that good binders for SARS-CoV are, in general, also good binders for SARS-CoV2 3CL pro . For each of these compounds, using the XLOGP3 methodology [20] , we computed the octanol/water partition coefficient (LogP) to assess the distribution in hydrophobic and cytosolic environments. LogP values range from \u22120.5 to 5 with a number of rotatable bonds from 2 to 12. Most of the LIGANN compounds bear from 2 to 5 H-bond acceptor or donors (Table S1 of the SI). In Fig. 3 / , i.e. when half of the protein molecules are inhibited, the probability to have both monomers inhibited is equal to 1/4, whatever the dissociation constant of the dimer [21] , hence the need for identifying nanomolar or subnanomolar inhibitors of 3CL pro .

The overall structural information was obtained by combining data from three independent simulations (for a total of about 120 ns), all started from the best docking pose of 27 on the 6LU7 monomeric structure. Further methodological aspects [25] are provided in the SI. In Fig. 4 , we show the probability distribution, P R ( ), of the distance R between the center of mass (CoM) of the ligand and that of the domains I + II. The distribution has a Gaussian shape with a half-width of about 1 \u212b, exhibiting only a minor positive skewness and defining a tight binding site volume V site of few \u212b 3 at most. [26] The MD-determined P R ( ) shows that the ligand never leaves the binding pocket at any stage during the whole simulation. In the inset of Fig. 4a , we show the potential of mean force (PMF) along the ligand-protein",

Fig. 4b shows polar and hydrophobic residues found in contact with the ligand 27. All essential residues for binding are included, with the addition of MET165, PHE140 and LEU141 hydrophobic residues, consistently lingering near the pyrazolic or the chlorinated phenyl rings of 27, in agreement with the hydrophobic character of the interaction. Figs. 3 and 4 show possible avenues for improvement. For example, forcing the L-shaped binding structure in bulk also, by redesigning the rotatable connectors in the ligand, may reduce the penalty due conformational entropy loss upon binding, [26] hence boosting the ligand affinity for 3CL pro . Building upon this knowledge, we plan to optimize the lead using MD simulations coupled to relative binding free energy calculation on congeneric variants [28] , eventually providing in silico determined anti-viral compounds to be synthesized an experimentally tested in vitro and in vivo.",
