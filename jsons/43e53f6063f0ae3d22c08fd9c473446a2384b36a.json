The capacity of cells to come in close contact with one another enables rapid exchange of information through directed secretion. In complex systems such as the nervous and immune systems, characteristic rearrangements of plasma membrane proteins appear at the cell-cell junction, called synapse. A synapse is defined as \"a stable adhesive junction across which information is relayed by directed secretion\".^ The concept of the neural synapse (NS) was first introduced over a century ago and was depicted as a stable structure organized and specialized in intercellular signaling between neurons. Plasma membranes of the pre and post-synaptic neurons are contiguous and information is conveyed to the downstream cell via secretion of neurotransmitters. In order to generate a favorable microenvironment, stabilization of synapse by scaffolding proteins, mainly cadherins and other adhesion molecules, is required (reviewed in re\u00a3 1). In the immune system, interactions between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) are essential for an effective adaptive immune response. By analogy with the nervous system, these specialized interactions occur via an immunological synapse (IS). The concept of the IS has been extended to several types of cell-cell interactions within the context of the immune system (signaling via receptor engagement, lytic granules, directed secretion of cytokines) since its first description 20 years ago (reviewed in refs. 2,3) . Although the IS shares many similarities with the NS, it also differs in two aspects. First, the panel of receptors and adhesion proteins recruited to the IS diverges from those in the neural synapse: integrins play the central role in stabilizing IS. Second, the establishment of an IS is a dynamic process between moving cells, whereas the neural synapse is long-lived. Therefore, in",

Nevertheless, some viruses use direct passage from cell-to-cell to spread within their host achieving, in the process, protection from neutralizing anti-bodies^ and complement as well as higher kinetics of replication (reviewed in ref 9 ).

The virus needs to circumvent this obstacle in order to gain a foothold within a new individual. In addition to capture by DCs or Dendritic Cells residing in mucosal epithelia, transcytosis of infectious virions across epithelial cells at mucosal sites of exposure may well be a strategy used by HIV-1. Early studies showed convincingly that transcytosis with cell-associated HIV-l was much more efficient than transcytosis of cell-free virions through epithelial cell layers. ^^'^^'^^ Virological synapses, in which HIV-1-infected blood mononuclear cells establish contacts with mucosal epithelial cells, were recently described, providing a likely explanation for this cell-to-cell vial transmission. In this context, HIV-l buds locally from the effector cell, followed by endocytosis and transcytosis without fusion from the apical to the serosal pole of epithelial cells.^^ Infection grants HIV-l-loaded cells the ability to interact with epithelial cells by upregulating the expression of surface adhesion molecules^ and by the presence of the viral envelope proteins gpl20 and gp4l. Epithelial cells also take part in VS formation and stabilization as well as in proper initiation of HIV-l transcytosis. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) agrin, present in the scaffolding complexes of neural and immunological synapses, ' serves as an HIV-1 attachment receptor through gp4l-binding, reinforcing virion interactions with its previously described endocytic receptor galactosyl ceramide (GalCer).^^ Nevertheless, this is not sufficient to initiate HIV-l trancytosis and additional signals supplied by the synaptic scaffold are crucial. Stable interactions between epithelial cells and HIV-1-infected PBMCs result partially from epithelial expression of the RGD-dependant Beta-1 integrin. Contacts between RGD-containing molecules, either at the surface of HIV-l-infected PBMCs or released as soluble factors,^ with Beta-1 integrins potentially initiate the signaling pathways leading to an efficient HIV-l trancytosis and its subsequent spread throughout the host.^",

In a physiological context, plant synapses share limited similarities with the mammalian neuronal as well as immunological synapse, allowing plants to deal with pathogen attacks, as well as establishing symbiotic interactions, by polarizing the endocytic and secretory machineries towards the intruding organisms (reviewed in ref 35) . The use of a VS-like structure in plants, impUcating genetic transfer from one discrete cell to another has been recendy demonstrated in the case of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), supporting the concept ofVS in plants. ^^^ Unlike HIV-1 DC-T cell VS that originates in tetraspanin rich multivesicular endosomes (MVB), TMV replication originates in the endoplasmic reticulum, before cell-to-cell propagation across plasmodesmata.^\u00ae^ There are significant differences between the VS of mammalian viruses when compared to VS-like structures in plants. Plasmodesmata are membrane Hnked pores in plant cell walls that provide continuity between adjacent cells, whereas in the immune system contacts between cells are transient and do not necessitate the formation of a pore. Nevertheless, cell-to-cell propagation of TMV through a plant VS-like structure is very reminiscent of the VS of mammalian retroviruses.",

This novel endosome targeted by HIV after capture by DCs is enriched in specific tetraspanins (CD81 and CD9) but contains only little CD63 (marker of MVB) and virtually no LAMP-1 (marker of lysosomes). ^^ This tetraspanin rich compartment targeted by HIV-l after capture by DCs is also rich in MVB. This is reminiscent of the situation in macrophages, a DC-related cell type, where HIV-l assembles in late endosomes exploiting the machinery implicated in MVB biogenesis. Viral release from macrophages happens subsequently by exocytosis.^^'^^ Although the tetraspanin rich endosome targeted by HIV in DCs^^ resembles the structures where HIV assembles in macrophages,^^ the location and mechanisms of HIV-l replication and budding within DCs remain to be characterized.^'^ Importantly, both HIV-infected and HIV-pulsed DCs are able to transmit a strong infection to T cells in trans. ^^''^^'^ The recent depiction of a VS formed between uninfected T lymphocytes and DCs pulsed with fluorescently tagged HIV-l has shed some light on the molecular processes at play.^^ The DC-T cell VS has also been termed \"Infectious Synapse\". In the DC-T cell situation the dendritic cell is not necessarily replicating virus and is transferring HIV to a target cell in trans, whereas in the T cell-T cells VS both cells (pre and postsynaptic) are productively infected. For the purpose of clarity in this review we will use the term VS also in the case of the DC-T cell Infectious Synapse. In DC-T cells conjugates, virions polarize to the contact surface between the adjacent cells. Simultaneously, HIV-l receptors (CD4) and coreceptors (CXCR4/CCR5) seem to be at least partially enriched on the T cell side of the junction with the DC^ ^ (EG and VP, unpublished observations). VS formation is possibly initiated by normal cellular interactions in which T cells \"scan\"DC in an antigen-independent fashion, searching for the cognate peptide presented by the APC.^^ Upon contact with T cells, internalized HIV-l relocates rapidly to the VS in which the tetraspanins CD81 and CD9 are also redistributed.^^ Given the apparent role of CD81 as an element of the j^86,87 (reviewed in see refs. 6,88), HIV-l subverts a pathway involved in IS formation and T cell activation to spread from DCs to uninfected CD4^T cells. ^^ On the T cell side of the synapse, engagement of the CD81 receptor might also play a role in increasing viral gene expression.^^",

Upon encountering Jurkat CD4* T cells, HIV-1 is redistributed from this intracellular compartment to the zone of contact (infectious synapse) between the DC and the CD4* T cell (D center and right). Immunological synapse marker MHC-II (HLA-DR) does not appear enriched in the infectious synapse.

On the post-synaptic side, talin polarizes as well at the site of cell-cell interaction and within minutes of synapse formation. Subsequently, HTLV-1 Gag protein transfer through VS is closely followed by HTLV-1 RNA genome transmission to the post-synaptic cell.^^ Interestingly, HTLV-1 T cell VS shares a common feature with the CTL-mediated IS: in both cases, the microtubules organizing center (MTOC) polarizes toward the cell-cell junction within the effector cell.^^'^^ Recognition of the cognate peptide and engagement of the TCR are responsible for MTOC movement in the CTL-mediated IS, while in the HTLV-1-induced VS polarization occurs regardless of the potential antigen presented. ^^ The molecular basis underUning HTLV-1 T cell VS formation have partially been revealed. Using an antibody-coated bead-cell assay used previously to analyze T cell activa-tion^^'^\u00ae^ followed by interfering experiments, engagement of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the effector cell (presynaptic cell) by lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (on the postsynaptic side) was shown to be a crucial signal causing microtubules to polarize to the VS.",
