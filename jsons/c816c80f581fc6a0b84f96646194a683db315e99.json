A population census survey was conducted in Nha-Trang and Ninh-Hoa to collect demographic, social-behavioral data and disease burden on SPID. The study site covered a population of 353,525 residing in 75,826 households with 24,781 children less than 5 years. Hospital databases from two hospitals covering the region were obtained. Linking the census and hospital databases, we were able to investigate on a variety of SPID such as environmental tobacco smoking exposure and increased risked of pediatric pneumonia hospitalization, population density, water supply and risk of dengue fever and animal livestock and risk of hospitalized diarrhea. To determine incidence, viral etiology and risk factors for pediatric ARI/pneumonia, we setup a population based prospective hospitalized Pediatric ARI surveillance at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Nha-Trang in February 2007. The study has revealed RSV, rhinovirus and influenza A as major viral pathogens, role of multiple viral infection and its interaction with bacteria in the development of pneumonia. In addition, we are also conducting a birth cohort study to investigate the incidence of congenital infection and its impact on physical-neurological development, and role of host genetic polymorphism on SPID hospitalization in Vietnam. Population mobility, high cost of regular census update and low mortality are the challenges.",

By collaborating with the Khanh Hoa Health Service Department, we could obtain access to the hospital and also the community/commune health centers.

The west, north, and south are surrounded by mountains. The population is living mainly in the center area and there is only one hospital, Khanh Hoa General Hospital (KHGH) which is providing hospital care in this area.

Do you go to the polyclinic, do you go to the private clinic, do you go to the hospital or do you just buy some drugs and stay at home or you just use traditional medicine? By asking those questions, it gives us an idea that how much proportion of the population is actually going to the hospital and what was happening in the community. We did the population census and disease burden survey, and obtained the hospital database from KHGH. Vietnam introduced digitalized hospital database system in 2003. Therefore we could obtain ICD-10 coded database from the hospital in this region.

In Vietnam there is a custom that some preschoolchildren and school children take a nap during lunch break prior to returning to school.

The results of the case-control study (151 cases who were hospitalized with DHF in the provincial hospitals and 604 age-matched neighborhood controls), illustrated that there was no difference in DHF hospitalization between the two groups (adjusted odds ratio = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.23-1.39) [5] .",

Scan statistics showed that areas with a high population density or adequate water supply did not experience severe outbreaks. The risk of dengue was higher in rural compared to urban areas, largely explained by lack of piped water supply, and in human population densities more often falling within the critical range. Mathematical modeling suggests that simple assumptions regarding area-level vector/host ratios may explain the occurrence of outbreaks. Thus we concluded from this study that improving water supply and vector control in areas with a human population density critical for dengue transmission could increase the efficiency of dengue control efforts.

Viruses are common causes of lower respiratory tract disease in children and represent a major public health problem. Due to the limited resources and facilities for virus isolation and detection, the role of viral respiratory pathogens in Vietnam has not been well-studied. Therefore to investigate the magnitude of viral respiratory infections among hospitalized children in Vietnam, we established a population based active pediatric ARI surveillance study and applied a newly developed multiplex-polymerase As previous speaker Professor Oshitani pointed out, even though blood culture examination was performed in the hospital, the positive rate was usually very low. Similarly, in our invasive pneumococcal study, we conducted blood culture for about 1000 samples however we obtained only about 7 or 8 positive result that means positive rate of less than 1% [8] . It was difficult to interpret the etiology based on the limited blood culture result. High rate 60% or 70% of antibiotic usage before coming to the hospital may be the most likely reason for this low blood culture positive rate. We thought that even the bacteria or the organism died, by using the molecular based methods like PCR, we should be able to amplify the nucleic acid of the pathogen, measure the copy number and it should be related to the disease etiology. Therefore, we set up a multiplex PCR assay to identify 13 different respiratory viruses (influenza A, B, RSV, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1-4, rhinovirus, coronaviruses OC43, 229E, adeno and boca viruses) and 3 different bacterial pathogens including Streptococcal pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.",

We investigated the antibody for rubella among the pregnant mother and found that one third of them did not have rubella antibod- ies. This finding showed that there was a risk of congenital rubella infection in central Vietnam and we suggested to the government for rubella vaccine introduction in Vietnam [13] . We also conducted a 2 years follow up study for the birth cohort children in 2011 and successfully follow up nearly 75% of them. This birth cohort study is ongoing. ",

If you can select a good study site, you can have advantages of efficiently monitoring the situation. (ii) Acquisition of skillful staff is also very important.Since Nha Trang field staffs are very well trained and they have experience in conducting various field and hospital based studies, we could achieve a very good outcome. (iii) Vietnam itself has an excellent up-to-down administration system. In the healthcare system, if you look from the lower level, they have primary healthcare system and then they have polyclinics, they have district hospital and provincial hospital. The health care system functions very efficiently too. In addition, Vietnam also has a good hospital database system which was very helpful for us. (iv) Another advantage is health care cost for children under 6 years, which is free of charge and then access to the hospital in our area is good. Within 30 minutes, the whole area can get to their healthcare facility. These are the advantages of our study.",

            "text": "(i) Population movement in the study area; there is always population movement, people are moving in and out like 10% to 15% every year, so you have to regularly monitor and update the population data.Since the study area is large, it requires a huge budget for this regular update. (ii) Community and hospital database matching; when we try to match these databases, but we can never get 100%. The maximum is 70%. Why? When they hospitalize, sometimes they give a different name, nickname or they give a different address like their relative's addresses rather than a correct one, so we could not link it correctly. We still we need to find way to improve this process. (iii) Low rate of diseases observed in low social economic class; Nha Trang is a kind of middle-class socioeconomic status, there are limited number of cases related to low-socioeconomic class like severe malnutrition, severe diseases, so it is not good to study such kind of diseases in our study area. (iv) Every year, the socioeconomic status is going up in the region and since the living cost is rising year by year, local staffs are demanding more and more sal-ary. That's also a big burden to continue to maintain this large study site.",

I would like to invite one question due to limitation of the time, pressing of the time, if somebody has a question? Any question? You mentioned that the outbreak of dengue is closely related to the density of the population. Lay-Myint Yoshida That's correct. Tetsu Yamashiro Yeah, I mean the density of the population is within some certain window. Lay-Myint Yoshida That's right. Tetsu Yamashiro So, I expect that if the population is more condensed, much more outbreak may occur, but it was not, do you have an explanation on it? Lay-Myint Yoshida We didn't have the entomological data, but I guess there might be optimal ratio between the population density and mosquito surrounding them. Even if there were too many people in the area if the mosquito density was not optimal, we will not see large outbreaks. Tetsu Yamashiro Very interesting data. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. Lay-Myint Yoshida Thank you very much.",
