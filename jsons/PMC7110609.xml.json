To date, halofuginone-lactate (HFL) seems to be a promising drug against bovine cryptosporidiosis (Villacorta et al., 1991, Naciri et al., 1993, Peeters et al., 1993, Lefay et al., 2001, Joachim et al., 2003, Jarvie et al., 2005), but although HFL is commonly recommended for both prevention and therapy, its efficacy has not been compared experimentally and recommendations for a rational use are not sufficiently documented. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a recommended 7 day administration of 0.1 mg/kg HFL for the prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in spontaneously infected calves.",

Before the study began it was found that 80% of animals up to 1 month of age in the herd were positive for coronavirus. Rotavirus was found in 13% of calves, mainly between the ages of 2\u20134 weeks. Twenty-two percent of animals, mainly up to 3 weeks of age, were positive for Escherichia coli K99 and the presence of Campylobacter jejuni and Clostridium perfringens was documented in 6% and 5% of animals, respectively.

Faecal scores were obtained daily from all calves between the ages of 1 and 31 days. In order to characterise the overall pattern of the infection, the average score during the 31-day-period (mean faecal score) was calculated for each animal. Similarly, the daily intensity of diarrhoea and the mean intensity of diarrhoea during the 31-day period were calculated. All the data were statistically compared using one-way ANOVA.",

The oocyst shedding pattern over time in the group treated with HFL between 8\u201314 days of age was the same as that of both placebo groups. In contrast, in the group receiving HFL on days 1\u20137 of age oocyst counts were minimal until day 9, but then the concentration of faecal oocysts increased, reaching a peak on day 20. This increased oocyst output coincided with a higher prevalence of diarrhoea (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). In the groups receiving placebo, all but one animal in the days 1\u20137 placebo group were positive for cryptosporidia. A total of five negative animals was seen in each HFL treated group.",

            "text": "We conclude that HFL significantly inhibited C. parvum infection and suppressed its symptoms but, surprisingly, the final effect appeared to be independent of whether the drug was administered preventively or therapeutically. The only difference between both treated groups was a delay in oocyst output and the occurrence of diarrhoea, as infection in the preventively treated group peaked about 10 days later. The benefit of using a preventive treatment with HFL is therefore questionable. On the other hand, postnatal calves are more susceptible to acid\u2013base balance disturbances and dehydration associated with severe diarrhoea. Since this risk decreases with age (Virtala et al., 1996), it may be argued that preventive use of HFL can delay the infection to an age when the animals are more resilient. The minimal differences between the preventive and therapeutic effects of the drug allow practitioners to choose between treatment options according to circumstances.",
