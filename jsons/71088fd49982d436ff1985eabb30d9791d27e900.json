A similar olfactory dysfunction has also been described for a SARS patient early in 2006. 14 Therefore, it is possible that injuried respiratory muscles and/or poor sensory response may play a role in the respiratory failure induced by SARS-CoV-2, though severe lung lesions and airway obstruction may bear most of the responsibility. Considering the possible involvement of nerves and/or muscles, neurophysiological assessment may be considered during the management of the patients with peripheral neurological symptoms.",

Among the involved brain areas, the brainstem has been demonstrated to be heavily infected by SARS-CoV 16, 17 or MERS-CoV. 7 Consistently, the olfactory and taste disorder reported for some COVID-19 patients may at least partially supports this possibility. The potential invasion into the central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 indicates a central mechanism underlying the acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, which may coexist with the peripheral without contradiction. 1 Autopsies and detailed analysis of nerve tissue from COVID-19 patients will be an effective measure to clarify the role of the central factors in the respiratory failure. 18 So far, several pieces of evidence have emerged showing the involvement of nervous system during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In this article, we provide new evidence recently reported regarding the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and respond to several comments on our previously published article. In addition, we also discuss the peculiar manifestations of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients and the possible involvement of nervous system. K E Y W O R D S cell susceptibility, coronavirus, dissemination, nervous system Based upon the clinical and experimental data available for coronaviruses (CoVs), we have suggested a neuroinvasive possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its possible role in the acute respiratory failure seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (J Med Viol https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25728), given that most CoVs share a similar viral structure and infection pathway among them. 1 Coraci et al 2 have commented on the significance of the treatment options suggested by us. However, the treatment options have not been incorporated in the final edition of our paper. 1 TurtleL. is cautious about our suggestions, especially about our views on the use of masks. He also doubts the neuroinvasive possibility, as in his views, he thinks that many viruses can only occasionally gain entry into human central nervous system.3",
