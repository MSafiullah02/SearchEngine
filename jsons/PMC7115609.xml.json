It was first discovered in the United States in the 1930s [3] as the causative agent of a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens, known as infectious bronchitis. Although IBV principally infects the upper respiratory tract, some IBV strains affect the renal tubuli, oviduct and parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Infection with IBV may lead to reduced growth and egg production, and is as such regarded as one of the economically most relevant viral pathogens in the poultry industry worldwide.",

The widely used live attenuated IBV vaccine, H120, was developed in the 1960s in The Netherlands by serial passaging of a Massachusetts-like IBV strain in embryonated eggs [4]. After 120 passages, the resulting virus H120 had become strongly attenuated as a result of its embryo adaptation and did not cause significant disease in young chicks, while it induced an immune response protective against challenge with wild type Massachusetts IBV [4]. The H120 vaccine has been used successfully for decades. With the worldwide occurrence of IBV in both commercial and backyard chicken in a wide variety of geno-, sero- and protectotypes [5], protection against IBV by vaccination has become far more complicated nowadays. Yet, the development of new live attenuated vaccines is still done by serial passaging of virus field isolates in embryonated eggs, which is a laborious and time-consuming process with unpredictable outcome with regards to vaccine safety and attenuation.",

            "text": "In order to investigate functions of IBV proteins in a directed way, several research groups independently developed systems to manipulate the IBV genome [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. These reverse genetics systems (RGS) are based either on the cell-culture adapted and highly attenuated IBV strain Beaudette or on the attenuated IBV vaccine strain H120. Since IBV Beaudette and H120 are highly attenuated [4], [11], the ability to study virulence factors of IBV in vivo is limited. This would require the introduction, or substitution, of factors contributing to the infection in vivo, including (parts of) the replicase genes and for example spikes from other IBV serotypes [12], [13], [14]. We have recently established a reverse genetics system based on the more virulent IBV strain H52 [4], [15]. Using targeted RNA recombination and performing the rescue and selection of candidate recombinants in embryonated chicken eggs, we solved the bottleneck of the inability to propagate virulent IBV strains to grow in cell culture. This provided a novel way to generate recombinant IBV for in vivo studies, including vaccine development.",

            "text": "The IBV genome encodes the nonstructural proteins involved in replication of the viral genome (ORF1ab) and the structural proteins spike S, membrane M, envelope E, and nucleocapsid N. In addition, genes 3 and 5, located between S and M and M and N, respectively, code for the proteins 3a, 3b, and 3c (E), and 5a and 5b [2]. These gammacoronavirus-specific proteins 3ab and 5ab are non-structural and non-essential for virus replication [9], [16], [17]. Several lines of evidence indicate, however, that they might have a role in viral pathogenesis in chickens. In particular, these genes are conserved across all IBV field strains [18] and recent studies indicate that the 3a and 3b proteins induced a delayed activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response in vitro, with protein 3a additionally being involved in resistance of IBV to the cellular antiviral state induced by IFN [19], [20]. Accessory protein 5b was found to contribute to host cell shut-off, including amongst others the inhibition of translation of type I IFN [21]. Based on these observations, and on the reported role of the accessory genes of other coronaviruses in pathogenicity [22], [23], [24], [25], we reasoned that the deletion of the accessory genes 3 and 5 might attenuate the more virulent phenotype of IBV H52 in vivo. Here our RGS [15] was used to generate mutant recombinant IBVs for vaccine development based on IBV H52 BI. We show that recombinant viruses lacking the 3ab and/or the 5ab gene cluster are viable and replicate like rIBV-H52, while showing reduced pathogenicity in chickens. Their ability to protect vaccinated chickens against a homologous challenge demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in creating next generation vaccines against infectious bronchitis.",

Design of the delta3ab fragment (\u03943ab) was such that the 1 nt overlap between the stop codon of the spike gene and the start codon of the 3a gene was replaced by an overlap between the stop codon of the spike gene and the start codon of the E gene (Fig. 1C-5). For the delta5ab fragment (\u03945ab) the start codon of the 5a gene is now used as start codon of the nucleocapsid gene (Fig. 1C-6). DNA fragments spanning the semi-unique restriction enzyme sites (RES) surrounding the accessory genes with the deletions designed as described (\u03943ab and \u03945ab) were cloned into pUC57-simple by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Delta3ab was ligated into p-IBV-5-1b-S-SIR [15] after NheI-PmlI double digestion to remove the 3ab gene, followed by the 3T region to form p-IBV-5-1b-S-SIR\u03943ab-3T, now called p-IBV-\u03943ab. Likewise, \u03945ab was ligated into p-IBV-3T [15] after AfeI-NheI double digestion to remove the 5ab gene. Fragment 3T\u03945ab was subsequently ligated after p-IBV-5-1b-S-SIR or p-IBV-5-1b-S-SIR\u03943ab to form p-IBV-5-1b-S-SIR-3T\u03945ab or p-IBV-5-1b-S-SIR\u03943ab-3T\u03945ab, respectively, now called p-IBV-\u03945ab and p-IBV-\u03943ab5ab.

No apparent clinical signs were observed in any of the birds during the course of the experiment, which was according to our experience upon inoculation under controlled conditions in isolators. As a readout for attenuation, the extent of ciliostasis in 10 tracheal sections per bird was therefore determined at 7 days post inoculation. For rIBV-wt and IBV H52 BI mean ciliostasis scores were 26 and 19, respectively, while non-vaccinated control animals did not show any ciliostasis (Fig. 5\nA). Supplementary file 2 shows the ciliostasis induced by IBV H52 wt and rIBV wt as observed in a comparable experiment (with scores of 34 and 40, respectively), demonstrating that both viruses are equally virulent for one-day-old chickens. All rIBV deletion mutants showed reduced ciliostasis compared to the wild type viruses, with rIBV-\u03943ab showing the most attenuated phenotype (Fig. 5A). A one-way ANOVA with HSD post hoc analysis showed that ciliostasis in IBV H52 BI- and rIBV-wt vaccinated animals was significantly different from that in the non-vaccinated animals (P < .05), while ciliostasis scores from rIBV-\u03943ab, rIBV-\u03945ab, or rIBV-\u03943ab5ab vaccinated animals did not differ from those in non-vaccinated controls.

Thus, vaccination with recombinant FIPV lacking the group-specific genes 3 or, to a lesser extent, virus lacking genes 7, could protect cats against a lethal challenge with the parental virus [22]. However, no protection was observed when both genes 3 and 7 had been deleted. In our study, rIBV-\u03943ab, rIBV-\u03945ab, and rIBV-\u03943ab5ab, each had the ability to protect against challenge with a virus of the same IBV serotype (Fig. 5B). In particular rIBV-\u03943ab showed the strongest attenuation based on the observed ciliostasis scores (Fig. 5A). A proper balance between attenuation and induction of protective immunity is critical when making a live attenuated virus vaccine and it needs to be tested in the appropriate animal model for each virus. In particular, the extent of attenuation caused by deletion of genes 3ab and 5ab might depend on the (pathogenicity of the) particular IBV strain being used. Finally, further studies will be needed to elucidate precisely the functions of the IBV 3ab and 5ab gene products in vivo, and how deletion of the genes results in the modulation of the host response to infection and, eventually, to the reduced ciliostasis in chickens.",
