These challenges are complicated by the lack of basic epidemiological data, which makes it difficult to predict epidemics. Thus, it is important to quantify actual outbreaks as novel infectious diseases emerge. Disease severity and rate of transmission can be predicted by mathematical models using the basic reproduction number (R\n0) [1]. For example, R\n0 has been used extensively to assess pathogen transmissibility, outbreak severity and epidemiological control [2], [3], [4].",

However, these studies typically considered community-acquired MERS infections. In this context, nosocomial infections can exhibit different R\n0 values as the transmission routes for community-acquired and nosocomial infections often differ [9]. Recent studies have examined large nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah and Riyadh within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). One study reported higher nosocomial R\n0 values than those from community-acquired infections when using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment (IDEA) model, which yielded values of 3.5\u20136.7 in Jeddah and 2.0\u20132.8 in Riyadh [10]. The IDEA model is simple because it does not consider the population-level immune status, which makes it especially useful for modelling emerging infectious diseases in resource-limited settings.",

However, an emerging infectious disease often has unknown epidemiology, making it difficult to model mathematically. Several methods have been proposed to address this issue, including the IDEA model. The Richards model can also estimate R\n0 using the cumulative daily number of cases and the outbreak turning point (or the peak, ti) [14]. In this context, Hsieh used the Richards model to estimate R\n0 values for the Korean outbreak as 7.0\u201319.3. However, the Richards model does not consider any countermeasures implemented during an outbreak; therefore, it can only be used after an outbreak has peaked.",

The IDEA model exhibited a good fit: the estimated R\n0 values for South Korea were 3.9\u20138.0, and the best-fit R\n0 was 4.9 for a serial interval of seven days. Conversely, R\n0 values for Riyadh and Jeddah were 1.9\u20132.5 and 3.9\u20136.9, respectively, using serial intervals of six to eight days. Majumder et al.\n[10] used the IDEA model and estimated very similar R\n0 values of 2.0\u20132.8 for Riyadh and 3.5\u20136.7 for Jeddah, with serial intervals of six to eight days. However, the estimated R\n0 values from the present study were much higher than the previously reported values of <1 for MERS (the threshold for an epidemic) [15]. Regardless, the Korean Government assumed that the outbreak had an R\n0 value <1 based on the previous research. The initial criterion for quarantine, therefore, was limited to cases of \u2018close contacts\u2019, which were defined as people who were within 2 m of a MERS patient for \u22651 h [16]. These quarantines \u2013 established using an incorrectly assumed R\n0 \u2013 resulted in more MERS patients and greater hospital-to-hospital transmission [16].",

This time period depends on the temporal relationship between the infectiousness of the disease, the clinical onset of the source case, and the incubation period of the receiving case [17]. As MERS becomes infectious with the onset of clinical symptoms, the MERS latency period equals the incubation period. Therefore, the shortest serial interval could be the same as the incubation period, and the longest serial interval could be the sum of the incubation period and the maximum duration of infectiousness. During the Korean MERS outbreak, several super-spreading events occurred because the MERS cases were not isolated immediately upon presentation of clinical symptoms [18]. Thus, these cases contacted susceptible individuals for up to one week after the onset of their clinical symptoms. However, most MERS cases with laboratory confirmation were isolated immediately after onset of clinical symptoms [19], [20]. In this study, as the incubation period was two to 14 days (median: six days), the serial interval was slightly longer than the incubation period. The IDEA model with several serial intervals (four to 12 days) was used and found that intervals of six to eight days provided the best fit. For KSA data, even though the reported date was used instead of the onset date, R\n0 was not affected because aggregated data by serial intervals was used in the analysis.",

Based on these findings, it appears that nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks in KSA and South Korea had higher R\n0 values than the previously assumed values of <1. Although community-acquired infections are caused by contact, nosocomial infections are caused by a combination of contact and aerosol transmission; therefore, R\n0 values for nosocomial infections can be higher than those for community-acquired infections. Hence, more comprehensive countermeasures are needed to address nosocomial MERS infections and prevent spread.",
