The gowns and gloves were changed after every case. The impervious gowns served as protective apparel, which provided a barrier to prevent contamination of the uniform and skin. Goggles, or face shields, helped to avoid splashes or sprays of body fluids or secretions to the mucous membranes of the eyes. The gloves provided a protective barrier and prevented gross contamination of the hands, reducing the likelihood of spread of microorganisms from person to person or from fomites (surface or equipment) to person.",

Because SARS appears to be spread by direct contact with respiratory secretions, touching of contaminated objects was a potential source of transmission. Hand hygiene (either by handwashing or the use of hand rub solution) was critical before and after contact with every patient. Once worn in the presence of a patient who was suspected of having SARS, the mask was considered potentially contaminated with infectious material (even if not visible), and touching of the mask was avoided. Reusable equipment such as stethoscopes was disinfected with alcohol-impregnated wipes after every patient.",

Mask-fitting sessions had to be carried out for all staff to ascertain the best-sized mask for each. Hand hygiene practical sessions were supervised to ensure it was performed correctly. The infection control officer gave briefings to everyone and all this had to be carried out rapidly, over a short period, to ensure all personnel had the necessary skills and knowledge early.",

SARS was also highlighted during the continuing education sessions for the paramedics, where the clinical presentations, the rapidly changing epidemiology, definitions, and risk factors were discussed. The history taking by paramedics now had to incorporate certain questions pertaining to risk for SARS, overseas travel, and fever. This was also performed by the emergency medical dispatcher (EMD) whenever possible. The reason for this was because the high-risk status could be identified early. Because the initial clinical features of SARS were not specific and physical signs on chest examination were minimal, they were cautioned that every patient could be a potential suspected SARS case.",
