A number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) activated by IFN mediate virus-inhibiting function at all stages of virus life cycle [2]. Among these, interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) 1, 2 and 3, a cluster of genes encoding membrane proteins, inhibit the fusion of viral envelope with endosomal membrane [3], and are therefore responsible for limiting infection by many kinds of viruses including influenza A virus (IAV), West Nile virus, Dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [4], [5], [6], [7]. Additionally, polymorphisms within IFITM genes might lead to differences in host susceptibility to viruses. Specifically, several laboratories demonstrated that the IFITM3 coding region genetic variant rs12252-C which is supposed to alter a splice acceptor site is associated with higher susceptibility to IAV [8], [9], [10], [11].",

They are expressed basally in primary tissues and cell lines [12] and robustly induced by either type I or type II IFNs [13]. Both Type I and type II IFNs activate ISGs through Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway. The difference is type I IFNs, such as IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, induce gene expression by the combinatorial binding of transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), phosphorylated STAT1 and 2 to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) within the target gene promoter, while type II IFN, IFN\u03b3, exerts its regulation through the induced binding of phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers to the gamma-activated sequence (GAS) [14]. Chromatin-remodeling factor BRG1 is also essential for IFITM1, 2 and 3 gene expressions [15], [16], as it constitutively binds to the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes and remodels the chromatin to make the promoters accessible to STAT1/STAT1/IRF9 transcription factor complex and transcription machinery [17]. Sp1 and TEF-1 are reported to be involved in recruiting BRG1 to the promoter of IFITM3 gene [16], [18].",

Then each construct was transfected into HEK293 cells, and cells were treated with 1000 U/mL IFN\u03b2 or PBS for 24 h before collection. We found that both E1-2 and E2-3 displayed enhancer activity (Fig. 1B). However, upon treatment of IFN\u03b2, the enhancer activity of E1-2 did not change whereas the enhancer activity of E2-3 was greatly elevated (Fig. 1B), suggesting E1-2 element was a constitutive enhancer while E2-3 element was an IFN\u03b2-responsive enhancer. Similar results were also confirmed in A549 cells (Fig. 1C).

Homozygous clone harboring truncated E2-3 was screened and confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2A). Luciferase reporter assay validated that the enhancer activity of the truncated E2-3 was greatly disrupted compared to that of wild type (Fig. 2B). Then we measured mRNA expression levels of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the mutant and corresponding wild-type control HEK293 cells treated with IFN\u03b2 or PBS. Expectedly, we found that IFN\u03b2-induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was significantly impaired in the mutant cells (Fig. 2C). This was further validated at the protein level as assessed by western blot (Figs. 2D and S1). By contrast, for the E2-3\u2032s nearest gene B4GALNT4 gene, neither its basal expression nor induction by IFN\u03b2 could be detected in our experiments (Fig. 2C). Similar results were also observed when cells were treated with IFN\u03b1 (Fig. S2), suggesting that IFITM1, 2 and 3, but not B4GALNT4 are bona fide targets of enhancer E2-3. In addition, whether IFN\u03b2 treatment or not, no difference was observed in the levels of STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) between the mutant and corresponding wild-type control HEK293 cells (Fig. S3), ruling out the possibility that impaired induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by IFN in mutant HEK293 cells was due to disruption of JAK-STAT pathway by CRISPR off-target effect.",

            "text": "Enhancer E2-3 is about 35 kb away from the IFITM locus, so how does it overcome such a long distance to regulate the expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes? Recent reports have showed that distal enhancers could form long-range interactions with the promoters of the targeted genes to exert its function [26]. To investigate whether enhancer E2-3 also behaved like this, we performed chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay in HEK293 cells [25]. Using enhancer E2-3 as anchor, we observed E2-3 looping to the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3. When cells were treated with IFN\u03b2, the interaction frequency increased, in accordance with the elevated expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 4A).To further validate this result, we also performed 3C assay using IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 locus as anchor respectively, and as expected, all of 3C data showed that E2-3 could interact with IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 especially when treated with IFN\u03b2 (Fig. S3, Fig. S4, Fig. S5). In addition, we observed the interactions among the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 (Fig. S4, Fig. S5, Fig. S6), suggesting IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes physically clustered together and were coordinated regulated by enhancer E2-3. Similar results were also confirmed in A549 cells (Figs. 4B and Fig. S4, Fig. S5, Fig. S6). Notably, unlike in HEK293, these interaction frequencies in A549 cells seemed not to change with the treatment of IFN\u03b2 (Figs. 4B and Fig. S4, Fig. S5, Fig. S6). The mechanism underlining this phenomenon was currently not clear. While cell line authentication of HEK293 and A549 cells using cell line STR genotyping ruled out that these cell lines were misused or contaminated (Fig. S7), one possible explanation for this phenomenon might be due to cell type difference.",

Although IFITM1, 2 and 3 were induced by PR8 virus in both wild-type and E2-3-truncated HEK293 cells, the inductions were greatly impaired upon truncation of E2-3 (Fig. 5A and B), further confirming the regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression by the enhancer E2-3. Surprisingly, we did not observe a significant effect on the replication of IAV when enhancer E2-3 was truncated, as revealed by the mRNA and protein levels of virus NP and progeny virus titers determined by TCID50 assay (Fig. S9). Nonetheless, when we treated wild-type and E2-3-truncated HEK293 cells with IFN\u03b2 respectively for 24 h before infection of PR8, NP mRNA and protein levels were found to be much higher in mutant HEK293 cells (Fig. 5C and D).

We also noticed that the induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was not completely disrupted by truncation of enhancer E2-3. Two possible explanations may be proposed: firstly, enhancer E2-3 was only truncated, not completely deleted. The residual E2-3 might still have an effect. Indeed, luciferase reporter assay indicated that the truncated E2-3 still had a minor enhancer activity under IFN treatment conditions. Secondly, given the nature of complicated chromatin interaction and regulation network in eukaryotic genomes, many studies have shown that genes could be regulated by multiple enhancers [34], [35], [36]. Therefore, it's possible that there are other redundant enhancers like E1-2, which was also identified as an enhancer in our luciferase reporter assay screening, controlling the expression of IFITM genes. After all, truncation of enhancer E2-3 decreased IFN\u03b2-induced resistance to IAV infection, highlighting its biological importance.",

However, previous ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq data indicated that only a small fraction (< 30%) of STAT1 binding sites were within 1 kb of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) [37], [38], [39]. The function of the large numbers of distal STAT1 binding sites remains unknown. Here we showed that STAT1 binding to the enhancer E2-3, which was located > 35 kb away from its target genes, was indispensable for its IFN-responsive enhancer activity. We therefore speculate that a similar enhancer function may also exist in other distal STAT1 binding sites. In addition to STAT1, STAT2 might also be involved in the regulation of IFITMs by enhancer E2-3, because STAT2 is also suggested to bind to E2-3 in IFN\u03b1-treated K562 cells, as inferred from ENCODE STAT2 ChIP-seq data. It's quite interesting that the promoters of IFITM genes already contain the binding sites for STAT1 or STAT2 while there still exists an enhancer mediating IFN/STAT signaling. A reasonable explanation might be that the distal enhancer could fine tune the expression of these important genes and thus add robust and plastic response to virus invasion and IFN stimulation. Besides the IFITM gene cluster, it has been previously reported that many other genes such as IFN\u03b2 gene [40], [41] and STAT1 gene [42] also behave like this, suggesting a general transcriptional regulation on eukaryotic gene expression.",

Consistent with transcriptional regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by the remote enhancer E2-3, we did observe long-range interactions between enhancer E2-3 and promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 using 3C assays in HEK293 and A549 cells. Notably, the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 also clustered together physically in three dimensions to form some kind of active chromatin hub [43], which might facilitate coordinated regulation of enhancer E2-3. Moreover, these interactions or active chromatin hub already existed before treatment of IFN. This may be beneficial to rapid induction of gene expression, thus timely restricting the infection of viruses. Such pre-formed promoter-enhancer interactions have been widely reported in many biological processes like TNF\u03b1 response, development and hypoxia [35], [44], [45]. Specifically, upon truncation of E2-3, the truncated E2-3 still interacted with the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3. A recent paper about a distal enhancer regulating PAG1 gene also reported a similar phenomenon [46]. It's possible that the driving force looping E2-3 to IFITM gene cluster might not be disrupted upon truncation of E2-3, suggesting roles of architectural factors residing outside E2-3, possibly CTCF and cohesin [47]. At last, considering the growing reports that one enhancer could contact and regulate multiple related genes, some of which are even on different chromosomes [34], [35], [45], [48], [49], we are open that E2-3 might also be able to associate with and regulate other ISGs in addition to IFITMs. These possibilities of course call for extensive efforts to examine in the future.",

This remote enhancer coordinately upregulated IFN-induced expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes through constitutive long-range interactions and IFN-induced recruitment of STAT1, thus contributing to IFN-induced resistance to IAV infection. These findings expanded our insights into the roles and mechanisms of enhancers in transcriptional regulation of IFITM genes and IFN-induced resistance to virus infection, which might contribute to our understanding of the complicated mechanisms underlying innate immunity, and shed new light on the characterization of novel disease susceptibility loci.",
