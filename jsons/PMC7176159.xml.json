SARS-CoV uses angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its functional receptor (Li et al. 2003) and enters cells through pH- and receptor-dependent endocytosis (Wang et al. 2008). Upon entering the cytoplasm the virus particle is uncoated, releasing the RNA genome. The viral genome directs the synthesis of two large polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, via a frameshifting mechanism involving a pseudoknot structure (Brierley et al. 1987). The resulting polypeptide contains a conserved array of functional domains, which upon proteolytic processing results in 15\u201316 nonstructural proteins (nsp), many of which are likely to be involved in either RNA synthesis or proteolytic processing of the polyprotein precursors of nsp1\u201316 (Snijder et al. 2003). The 3\u2032 one-third of the genome contains the genes for viral structural proteins and accessory proteins. These genes are expressed by transcription of a 3\u2032 coterminal nested set of 7\u20139 mRNAs that also contain a common ~70\u201390 nucleotide (nt) 5\u2032 leader identical in sequence to the 5\u2032 end of the genome (Lai et al. 1983, 1984; Spaan et al. 1982). The 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence contains a short (6\u20138 nt) sequence, the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) also present in the genome just 5\u2032 to the coding sequence for each mRNA (Budzilowicz et al. 1985).",

            "text": "Coronavirus RNA transcription occurs in the cytoplasm. All the coronavirus mRNAs have a common leader sequence at their 5\u2032 ends (Spaan et al. 1982). The leader sequence contains a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L) at its 3\u2032 end. This sequence motif constitutes part of the signal for subgenomic mRNA transcription. Preceding every transcription unit on the viral genomic RNA are additional transcription regulatory elements, named body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-B) (Budzilowicz et al. 1985). All coronavirus TRSs can be divided into three sequence blocks, the core 6\u20138 nt sequence (CS), plus 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking sequences (Sola et al. 2005). The most frequently used CS for group 1 coronaviruses is a hexamer (5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032). For group 2 coronaviruses a heptameric sequence, 5\u2032-UCUAAAC-3\u2032 is the consensus sequence; it is almost identical to the group I CS. Interestingly, SARS-CoV has a CS (5\u2032-ACGAAC-3\u2032) which differs from other group 2 coronaviruses (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003). The CS for group 3 coronaviruses is a divergent octamer, 5\u2032-CUUAACAA-3\u2032 (Alonso et al. 2002). The related arterivirus CS is 5\u2032-UCAACU-3\u2032 and partially resembles the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) CS (van Marle et al. 1999).",

            "text": "The functional importance of the TRS-L and TRS-B in the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA was shown by a mutagenesis study in equine arteritis virus (EAV), a member of the related arterivirus genus, utilizing a reverse genetic system (van Marle et al. 1999). Mutagenesis of the RNA 7 TRS-B significantly reduced its transcription. In contrast, mutagenesis of TRS-L affected all subgenomic mRNA transcription, and compensatory mutations in both TRS-L and RNA7 TRS-B restored RNA 7 transcription. This evidence strongly supports the mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand transcription. An additional comprehensive covariation mutagenesis study of several EAV TRSs demonstrated that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base-pairing between sense TRS-L and antisense TRS-B, but also upon the primary sequence of the TRS-B (Pasternak et al. 2001). While the TRS-L merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the TRS-B fulfills multiple functions. The sequences of mRNA leader-body junctions of TRS mutants strongly suggested the discontinuous step occurs during minus-strand synthesis. The development of reverse genetic systems for several coronaviruses has allowed a similar molecular genetic approach to investigating the role of the coronavirus TRS rather than using DI replicons. For TGEV, analysis of the role of TRS demonstrated that the canonical CS-B was not absolutely required for the generation of subgenomic mRNAs, but its presence led to transcription levels at least 1,000-fold higher than those in its absence (Zuniga et al. 2004). A recent study in SARS-CoV rewired the TRS circuit (Yount et al. 2006). Recombinant genomes were constructed that contained mixtures of the wild-type and mutant regulatory TRS. Viable viruses were isolated from wild-type and recombinant genomes containing homogeneous transcription circuits; chimeras that contained mixed regulatory networks were invariantly lethal. In the lethal mutants the mixed TRS circuits promoted inefficient subgenomic transcription from inappropriate start sites, resulting in truncated open reading frames (ORFs) and minimized viral structural protein expression (Yount et al. 2006). This experiment provides further evidence for the discontinuous synthesis of minus-strand RNAs and the key role of TRS-L and TRS-B sequences in regulating subgenomic RNA synthesis.",

(1994) demonstrated that the BCoV 68 nt leader is a necessary part of the 498 nt cis-acting signal for DI RNA replication. RNA higher-order structures contained in group 2 coronaviruses 5\u2032 UTR were first predicted for BCoV using the Mfold algorithm (Chang et al. 1994). Subsequently, enzymatic probing and functional mutational analysis (Chang et al. 1996; Raman et al. 2003; Raman and Brian 2005) defined four stem-loops, denoted I, II, III, and IV within the first 210 nts of BCoV. The predicted stem-loop I (nts 11\u201342) contains three contiguous Waston\u2013Crick base-pairs and a large 16 nt loop and is not conserved among group 2 coronaviruses (Chang et al. 1994). The predicted stem-loop II (nts 51\u201384) is a A\u2013U base-pair-rich hairpin with a low free energy that folds the TRS into the terminal loop. A poorly conserved stem-loop II homolog has been predicted in other coronaviruses, and in EAV (van der Born et al. 2004; Raman and Brian 2005). Stem-loop III (nts 97\u2013116) is phylogenetically conserved and appears to have homologs in coronavirus groups 1 and 3; enzymatic probing and mutational analysis in DI RNA replication assays supports its existence (Raman et al. 2003). Stem-loop IV (nts 186\u2013215), a bulged stem-loop, is also conserved amongst group 2 coronaviruses and may have a homolog in group 1 and 3. However, the predicted stem-loop IV homolog in SARS-CoV appears to be group 1-like (Raman and Brian 2005). Stem-loop IV exists as a higher-order structure based on enzymatic probing and it is required for DI RNA replication. Recently, two stem-loops, SLV (nts 239\u2013310) and SLVI (nts 311\u2013340), extending into the nsp1 coding region were demonstrated by RNase structure probing and sequence covariation among closely related group 2 coronaviruses. SLVI is required for DI RNA replication (Brown et al. 2007).",

Recently, we proposed a consensus secondary structural model of the 5\u2032 140 nts of the 5\u2032 UTR based on nine representative coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV) from all three coronavirus groups (Kang et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2007). The 5\u2032 ~140 nts of the nine coronaviruses genomes were predicted to fold into three major stem-loops, denoted SL1, SL2, and SL4 (see Fig. 4.1). Some sequences were predicted to contain a fourth stem-loop, SL3, which folds the TRS-L into a hairpin loop. SL1, SL2, and SL4 were structurally conserved amongst all coronaviruses examined. SL3 is only predicted to be stable for human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and SARS-CoV. It should be noted that SL1 and SL2 differ from the structures studied in BCoV pDrep 1 RNA by the Brian group (Chang et al. 1996; Raman et al. 2003; Raman and Brian 2005). However, SLIII in Brian\u2019s model is almost identical with our SL4b (Liu et al. 2007; Raman et al. 2003).\n",

            "text": "A detailed mutational and biophysical study of MHV SL1 revealed that this stem-loop is functionally and structurally bipartite. SL1 contains one or more noncanonical base-pairs in the central portion of the stem. In MHV, two pyrimidine\u2013pyrimidine base-pairs are present in the middle of SL1, as demonstrated by NMR studies (Liu et al. 2007). These noncanonical base-pairs divide the SL1 helical stem into upper and lower segments. The upper region of SL1 is required to be base-paired; mutations that disrupted base-pairing of this region were not viable or severely impaired (Li et al. 2008). Combining both sets of mutations in the upper region of SL1 restored the base-pairing and yielded a viable virus comparable to the wild-type virus in its growth phenotype. In contrast, mutations in the lower region of SL1 that destroyed base-pairing were viable, and genomes with compensatory mutations predicted to restore base-pairing were nonviable. Deletion of a bulged or extruded A in the lower portion of the stem (mutation \u0394A35), a mutation that increased the thermal stability of the lower portion of the SL1 helix, was strongly selected against. \u0394A35-containing viruses were rapidly replaced by viruses containing destabilizing second-site mutations near \u0394A35. Additionally, mutations that increased the stability of the lower portion of SL1 were lethal, suggesting that structural lability in the lower portion of the SL1 stem was required. Thermal denaturation and imino proton exchange experiments further demonstrated that the lower half of SL1 is unstable. SL1 second-site mutants also contained an additional second-site mutation, A29G or A78G, in their 3\u2032 UTR, providing genetic evidence for an interaction between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. Thus we hypothesized that the base of SL1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR (Li et al. 2008). These data, plus the observed defects in subgenomic RNA synthesis in our nonviable SL1 mutants, are consistent with the genome circularization model for coronavirus transcription put forward by Zuniga et al. (2004) and suggest that replication complexes and transcription complexes have different structural requirements in the 5\u2032 UTR.",

NMR studies of SL2 indicated that the U0 imino proton donates a hydrogen bond in SL2, consistent with a U-turn structure. However, there was no evidence for the predicted noncanonical pyrimidine\u2013pyrimidine base-pair between positions 47 and 51. Additional NMR studies indicate that U51 was extruded from the loop and that the Watson\u2013Crick faces of C47 and G50 were in apposition (Li and Giedroc, unpublished). Formation of the stem was required for virus viability, although the sequence of the stem was unimportant (Liu et al. 2007). Replacing U48 with either cytosine or adenosine was lethal, consistent with a UNR loop structure for SL2 (Liu et al. 2007). However, viruses containing a U48G mutation were viable and replicated almost as well as wild-type virus. NMR studies indicated that a guanine at position 48 engaged in a hydrogen bond, similar to that observed for U48. Mutagenesis of U49 and U51 demonstrated that any nucleotide can function in these positions, whereas the G at position 50 is required (Liu et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009). RT-PCR analyses of cells electroporated with genomes containing lethal mutations in SL2 demonstrate that SL2 is required for subgenomic RNA synthesis, as was SL1. Taken together the functional and structural data suggests that SL2 more closely resembles a YNMG-like tetraloop than a U-turn. Additional NMR studies should provide an atomic resolution structure to determine the preise geometry of the loop.",

Initial DI deletion analyses found that the minimal 3\u2032 terminus sequence required to support MHV DI RNA replication is 436 nts, a region containing part of the upstream N gene and the entire 301 nt 3\u2032 UTR (Lin and Lai 1993; Luytjes et al. 1996). For TGEV and IBV, the minimal sequence requirements were 492 nts and 338 nts respectively, and did not include any part of the N gene (Mendez et al. 1996; Dalton et al. 2001). It was later confirmed this was also true for MHV, as a recombinant virus containing the N gene translocated into an upstream genomic position was viable (Goebel et al. 2004a). For MHV, the differing conclusions resulting from DI assays and intact virus may reflect the fact that DI assays are inherently competition assays with wild-type genomes and thus may be more sensitive at detecting minor decreases in relative fitness then assays with infectious viruses that focus on recovering viable viruses. This was clearly true in experiments in which DI RNAs carrying mutations at the 3\u2032 end failed to replicate at detectable levels, but recombinant viruses with these same mutations were viable with only modestly impaired replication phenotypes (Johnson et al. 2005). A deletion analysis utilizing a DI RNA replicon defined the minimum sequence needed for minus-strand RNA synthesis as the 3\u2032-most 55 nts plus the poly(A) tail (Lin et al. 1994). Spangnolo and Hogue demonstrated that the poly(A) tail was required for DI replication, although as little as five As would suffice to initiate replication (Spagnolo and Hogue 2000).",

The 5\u2032-most of these, a 68 nt bulged stem-loop immediately downstream of the N gene stop codon, was predicted to be absolutely conserved in MHV, BCoV, HCoV-OC43, and bovine enteric coronavirus. This stem-loop was further characterized biochemically, and mutagenesis demonstrated that it was essential for DI RNA and for viral replication (Hsue et al. 2000). A 54 nt hairpin-type pseudoknot 3\u2032 to the 68 nt bulged stem-loop was first found to be required for DI RNA replication in the 3\u2032 UTR of BCoV (Williams et al. 1999). This pseudoknot is phylogenetically conserved among coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV (Goebel et al. 2004b), both in location and in shape but only partially in nucleotide sequence. In a later study with MHV (Goebel et al. 2004a), this pseudoknot was demonstrated to partially overlap with the bulged stem-loop, such that the last part of the bulged stem-loop overlaps with stem 1 of the pseudoknot; thus these two structures cannot be formed simultaneously. This finding led to the proposal that the bulged stem-loop and the pseudoknot are components of a molecular switch that regulate viral RNA synthesis (Goebel et al. 2004a).",

This structure was predicted by computer-assisted analysis of the last 166 nts of the genome 3\u2032 to the pseudoknot using the Mfold algorithm (Liu et al. 2001). Enzymatic probing of RNA secondary structure supported the existence of the predicted long bulged stem-loop encompassing nts 143\u201368 and with a second stem-loop from nts 67 to 52. Within the long stem-loop, a conserved bulged-stem structure (nts 142\u2013132 and nts 79\u201368) also present in BCoV was identified by covariation analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis and DI RNA replication assays indicated that the long bulged-stem loop between nts 143 and 68 plays an important role in DI RNA replication. Similar assays to examine the shorter stem-loop between nts 67 and 52 failed to provide evidence for a role in DI replication (Liu et al. 2001). The long bulged stem-loop contains an octanucleotide sequence, 5\u2032-GGAAGAGC-3\u2032 (nts 81\u201374 in MHV), that is conserved in the 3\u2032 UTR of coronaviruses from all three groups, and thus might have important biological functions.",

An extensive mutational analysis of the HVR was carried out by deletion, rearrangements, and point mutations (Goebel et al. 2007). All these mutations have only modest effects on viral replication, indicating that the HVR is not essential for viral RNA synthesis. This result differs from the results obtained in DI systems by Liu et al. (2001) and by Lin et al. (1994). Since the most extensive HVR mutant deleted nts 30\u2013170, it is clear that not all 55 nts are required for minus-strand replication. A possible explanation for these discrepancies is the inherent competitive nature of DI replication assays greatly increasing the effects of mutations that are only moderately deleterious in the context of the intact genome. The HVR deletion mutant was highly attenuated in mice, suggesting that the HVR might play a significant role in viral pathogenesis (Goebel et al. 2007). However, it should be kept in mind that the HVR deletion virus grew to a titer 2\u20133-fold less than that of wild-type virus in cell culture, making the interpretation of its effect on pathogenesis difficult.",

Indeed, several cellular proteins have been shown to interact with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the coronavirus genome (see Fig. 4.1). At the 3\u2032 end of the coronavirus genome, the 73 kDa cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to the poly(A) tail (Spagnolo and Hogue 2000). A series of host proteins were found to bind to the MHV 3\u2032-most 42 nt RNA probe using RNase protection/gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays (Yu and Leibowitz 1995a, 1995b). Further analysis revealed that these proteins include mitochondrial aconitase and the chaperones mitochondrial HSP70, HSP60, and HSP40 (Nanda et al. 2004; Nanda and Leibowitz 2001). DI replication assays suggested that proteins binding to both the poly(A) tail and the last 42 nts of the MHV genome had a role in replication. Mutations in the 3\u2032(+)42 host protein binding element had a deleterious effect on the accumulation of DI RNA, and when the same mutations were introduced into the MHV genome, one mutant was found to be nonviable. This mutant had a defect in subgenomic mRNA synthesis which points to a potential role for sequences at the extreme 3\u2032 end of the MHV genome in subgenomic RNA synthesis (Johnson et al. 2005), a finding consistent with the model proposed by the Enjuanes group (Zuniga et al. 2004). Polypyrimidine tract-binding (PTB) protein was shown to bind to two regions of the MHV 3\u2032 UTR, a strong PTB binding site was mapped to nts 53\u2013149, and another weak binding site was mapped to nts 270\u2013307 on the complementary strand of the 3\u2032 UTR (Huang and Lai 1999). Since a number of these binding sites are deleted in the replication competent HVR mutant virus discussed above, it is unlikely that most of these proteins are required for viral replication (Goebel et al. 2007).",

It has been suggested that N protein binding to TRS-L favors translation of viral RNAs (Tahara et al. 1998) and may also play a role in MHV RNA synthesis (Li et al. 1999). Recently, BCoV NSP1 was shown to bind three 5\u2032 UTR and one 3\u2032 UTR-located cis-replication stem-loops and may function to regulate viral genome translation or replication (Gustin et al. 2009). Another cellular protein, the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 was demonstrated to bind to the MHV minus-strand leader and TRS-B complementary sequences through immunoprecipitation after UV cross-linking and by in vitro binding assays with recombinant protein (Li et al. 1997). hnRNP A1 was shown to have two binding sites at the MHV 3\u2032 end and these binding sites are complementary to the sites on the minus-strand RNA that bind PTB (Huang and Lai 2001). Mutations that affect PTB binding to the negative strand of the 3\u2032 UTR also inhibited hnRNP A1 binding on the positive strand, indicating a possible relationship between these two proteins. Furthermore, both hnRNP A1 and PTB bind to the complementary strands at the 5\u2032 end of MHV RNA. Based on these observations, it was proposed that hnRNP A1\u2013PTB interactions provide a molecular mechanism for potential 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 cross-talk in MHV RNA, which may be important for RNA replication and transcription. However, the role of hnRNP A1 in viral replication is controversial. Paul Masters\u2019 group (Shen and Masters 2001) tested the role of hnRNP A1 in viral transcription and replication by inserting a high-affinity hnRNP A1 binding site in place of, or adjacent to, an intergenic sequence in the MHV genome. This inserted hnRNP A1 binding site was not able to functionally replace or enhance transcription from the intergenic sequence. Additionally, MHV was able to replicate normally and synthesize normal levels of genome and subgenomic RNAs in cells lacking hnRNP A1, suggesting that hnRNP A1 is not required for MHV discontinuous transcription or genome replication. However, it was subsequently shown that other members of the hnRNP family can substitute for hnRNAP A1 (Choi et al. 2004).",
