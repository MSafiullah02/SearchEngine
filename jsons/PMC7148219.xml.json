This is a typical situation in many applications where different sources generate different views of samples unevenly; like text information present in all Wikipedia pages while images are more scarce. Another example is multilingual text classification where documents are available in two languages and share the same set of classes while some are just written in one language. Previous works supposed the existence of view generating functions to complete the missing views before deploying a learning strategy [2]. However, the performance of the global multiview approach is biased by the quality of the generating functions which generally require external resources to be set. The challenge is hence to learn an efficient model from the multiple views of training data without relying on an extrinsic approach to generate altered views for samples that have missing ones.",

These models have been mostly applied to image analysis and major advances have been made on generating realistic images with low variability [7, 15, 16]. GANs take their origin from the game theory and are formulated as a two players game formed by a generator G and a discriminator D. The generator takes a noise z and produces a sample G(z) in the input space, on the other hand the discriminator determines whenever a sample comes from the true distribution of the data or if it is generated by G. Other works included an inverse mapping from the input to the latent representation, mostly referred to as BiGANs, and showed the usefulness of the learned feature representation for auxiliary discriminant problems [8, 9]. This idea paved the way for the design of efficient approaches for generating coherent synthetic views of an input image [6, 14, 21].",

For a given document with a missing version in one language, the corresponding generator induces the latter conditionally on the observed one. The training of the generators is carried out by minimizing a regularized version of the cross-entropy measure proposed for multi-class classification with GANs [19] in a way to force the models to generate views such that the completed bilingual documents will have high class assignments. At the same time, the discriminator learns the association between documents and their classes and distinguishes between observations that have their both views and those that got a completed view by one of the generators. This is achieved by minimizing an aggregated cross-entropy measure in a way to force the discriminator to be certain of the class of observations with their complete views and uncertain of the class of documents for which one of the versions was completed. The regularization term in the objectives of generators is derived from an adapted feature matching technique [17] which is an effective way for preventing from situations where the models become unstable; and which leads to fast convergence.",

            "text": "Multiview learning has been an active domain of research these past few years. Many advances have been made on both theoretic and algorithmic sides [5, 12]. The three main families of techniques for (semi-)supervised learning are (kernel) Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Multiple kernel learning (MKL) and co-regularization. CCA finds pairs of highly correlated subspaces between the views that is used for mapping the data before training, or integrated in the learning objective [3, 10]. MKL considers one kernel per view and different approaches have been proposed for their learning. In one of the earliest work, [4] proposed an efficient algorithm based on sequential minimization techniques for learning a corresponding support vector machine defined over a convex nonsmooth optimization problem. Co-regularization techniques tend to minimize the disagreement between the single-view classifiers over their outputs on unlabeled examples by adding a regularization term to the objective function [18]. Some approaches have also tackled the tedious question of combining the predictions of the view specific classifiers [20]. However all these techniques assume that views of a sample are complete and available during training and testing.",

The authors proposed a Rademacher complexity bounds for a multiview Gibbs classifier trained on multilingual collections where the missing versions of documents have been generated by Machine Translation systems. Their bounds exhibit a term corresponding to the quality of the MT system generating the views. The bottleneck is that MT systems depend on external resources, and they require a huge amount of parallel collections containing documents and their translations in all languages of interest for their tuning. For rare languages, this can ultimately affect the performance of the learning models. Regarding these aspects our proposed approach differs from all the previous studies, as we do not suppose the existence of parallel training sets nor MT systems to generate the missing versions of the training observations.",

The model consists of three neural-networks implementing a three players game between a discriminator and two generators. For an observation with a missing view, the corresponding generator produces the view conditionally on the other observed one. The discriminator is trained to recognize observations with a generated view from others having their views complete and to classify the latter into one of the existing classes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on another challenging application than image analysis which is the domain of choice for the design of new GAN models. Our experiments on a subset of Reuters RCV1/RCV2 show the effectiveness of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\texttt {Cond}^2\\texttt {GANs}$$\\end{document} to generate high quality views allowing to achieve significantly better results, compared to the case where the missing views are generated by Machine Translation which requires a large collection of sentences and their translations to be tuned. As future study, we will be working on the generalization of the proposed model to more than 2 views. One possible direction is the use of an aggregation function of available views as a condition to the generators.",
