There are also associated complications, which should be recognized in order to make correct decisions regarding interventions or management. Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecifi c, especially in infants and younger children. Some children with pneumonia even present with nonrespiratory symptoms including fever, malaise, decreased appetite, irritability, weakness, chest pain, and abdominal symptoms. Physical examination is also less reliable in children than adults (Donnelly 2001 ) . Microbiological tests are important but could be diffi cult to obtain especially in younger children. Various medical imaging modalities not only play an important role as an aid in diagnosis but can also help during and after therapy. Diagnosis of pneumonia calls for a combination of clinical awareness, appropriate microbiological tests, and radiological studies.",

            "text": "The cause of pneumonia in a child is often diffi cult to identify, but the patient's age can help narrow the possible etiologies. Viral pneumonia is rare in the neonatal period because of conferred maternal antibody protection. Group B streptococcus and Gram-negative enteric bacteria are the most common pathogen in neonates (birth to 20 days), obtained through vertical transmission from the mother during birth. From age 3 weeks to 3 months, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen. Viruses are the most frequent cause of community-acquired pneumonia in infants older than 4 months and in preschool-aged children, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most common. For school-aged children (6-16 years old), the incidence of bacterial infections from Streptococcus increases, although viral disease remains the most common cause (Condon 1991 ; Ostapchuk et al. 2004 ) . Bacterial pneumonia can occur at any time in preschool and school-aged children and adolescents. Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes 30 % of lower respiratory tract infections in school-aged children (Condon 1991 ; Donnelly 2001 ) . Infectious agents causing pneumonia are not limited to viruses and bacteria, but it could also be due to Mycobacteria , fungi, protozoa, and parasites. Co-infection with two or more microbial agents can also occur.",

The chest x-ray fi ndings are often nonspecifi c and can appear normal, but the most common abnormality is hyperaeration (Yalcin et al. 2003 ). On HRCT, there is a mosaic perfusion pattern ( Fig. 13 .5 ). Perfusion is diminished in areas of parenchymal attenuation due to vasoconstriction secondary to hypoxia. Inspiratory and expiratory phases of ventilation are important in HRCT to better assess air trapping in this condition (Hansell et al. 1997 ) . Peribronchial thickening, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and sometimes lung volume reduction can also be seen. Swyer-James is a subtype of postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans, which is typically unilateral. It can affect one lung segment, a lobe, or the entire lung. The characteristic chest radiographic and CT fi ndings are hyperlucency due to the pulmonary hypoperfusion, reduction of vascular and hilar markings, and volume reduction of the affected lung or lobe (Daltro et al. 2011 ) (Fig. 13 .6 ).",

CT fi ndings include lung consolidation with decreased parenchymal enhancement, loss of lung-pleura margin, and multiple thin-walled cavities lacking an enhancing border. The adjacent visceral pleura is particularly fragile and tends to rupture, causing bronchopleural fi stula (Hoffer et al. 1999 ) (Fig. 13 .10 ).

In the western hemisphere, parasitic pneumonia secondary to Toxoplasma gondii is associated with compromised hosts, particularly acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Strongyloides stercoralis infestation is seen in patients receiving glucocorticoids or chemotherapy and in patients with AIDS or other causes of T-cell dysfunction (Berk and Verghese 1998 ) . Ascaris infestation generally occurs through hand-to-mouth ingestion of food contaminated with parasite eggs, while hookworms are transmitted through larval penetration of the skin. Symptomatic pulmonary disease may present with fever, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and wheezing. These pulmonary symptoms could be due to Loffl er's syndrome, effects of larval tissue migration, airway reactivity or bronchospasm, superimposed bacterial infection, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (Sarinas and Chitkara 1997 ) . Ascaris and hookworm infections present with peripheral eosinophilia during larval migration phase. Chest radiographs could be normal or demonstrate nonspecifi c patchy pulmonary infi ltrates (Fig. 13.27 ) . CT scan could depict abnormalities better and could show ground-glass pulmonary lesions with ill-defi ned margins as well as nodules (Sakai et al. 2006 ).",

Primary immunodefi ciency can be broadly divided into T-cell (cellular) immune defi ciency versus B cell (humoral defi ciency). Humoral immunodefi ciencies are the most commonly encountered type characterized by defective antibody production with increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections but able to recover from viral infections (Fig. 13.28 ). Examples are X-linked agammaglobulinemia, IgA defi ciency, and common variable immunodefi ciency. Cellular immunodefi ciencies have increased susceptibility to disseminated viral and opportunistic infections. Cellular immune disorders include DiGeorge syndrome and severe combined immunodefi ciency (Collingsworth 2005 ) .",

Most children are infected after vertical transmission from their mother, and majority develop acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS) early in life. There is increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and opportunistic infections. Lobar or segmental consolidations are the most common patterns (Marks et al. 1996 ) . Mycobacterial infection can be seen in AIDS patients, and the radiographic appearance mimics that seen in immunocompetent children with primary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare is also encountered later in the course of disease and imaging fi ndings cannot be distinguished with other forms of mycobacterial infections (Collingsworth 2005 ) . Pneumocystis jiroveci is the most common opportunistic pulmonary infection in children with AIDS, occurring in up to 50 %, and is the leading pulmonary cause of death (Jeanes and Owens 2002 ) . Radiographic appearances are variable and include hyperinfl ation with diffuse bilateral interstitial or nodular infi ltrates from the perihilar region to the periphery, which often progresses to widespread alveolar opacities with air bronchogram (Fig. 13.30 ) . Cavitary nodules and cysts can be seen, with pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum as common complications. HRCT fi ndings include patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacity, consolidation, cyst or cavities, centrilobular opacities, nodules, peribronchial cuffi ng, and interlobular septal thickening (Jeanes and Owens 2002 ; Collingsworth 2005 ) .

( a ) Radiograph of a 13-year-old girl who presented with cough and chest pain shows a mass-like opacity in the left lower lobe, later confi rmed to be Echinococcus infection. ( b ) A 12-year-old boy with abdominal pain had a chest x-ray showing curvilinear opacities within a cyst in the right lower lobe. This is compatible with the \"water-lily\" sign in hydatidosis (Cases courtesy of Ali Yikilmaz, MD, from Turkey) 27 Ascariasis. Chest radiograph following barium study ( a ) demonstrates Ascaris within the esophagus ( small black arrows ) as well as in the right pleural cavity ( open arrow ) indicative of esophageal perforation.
