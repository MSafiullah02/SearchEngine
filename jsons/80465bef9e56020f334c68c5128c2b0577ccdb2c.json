Therefore, irrational beliefs or subscription to myths about COVID-19 prevention measures could stimulate pervasive EPB. EPB consumes a high degree of personal physical energy, and in the process diminishes disease immunity. Excessive protective measures can overstress healthcare facilities and other resources, and consequently exert a strong negative impact upon the economy and society as a whole [20] .For example, panic buying of essential consumer items like toilet paper, first aid kits, bottled water, and hand sanitizer, in response to COVID-19, has led to global shortages and price gouging of consumer staples [20] .This response",

For effective prevention, it is necessary both to avoid inadequate prevention measures that increase the likelihood of a disease epidemic, and to avoid excessive activities that waste personal and social resources. These two scenarios may vary across cultures. Inadequate prevention may be a prominent problem in Western culture and excessive prevention in Eastern culture [8] . A related dimension of such cultural variance is societal \"rigidity\" versus \"porousness\" [26] .\"Rigid\" cultures, such as those of Singapore, Japan, and China, have strict social norms and punishment for deviance, whereas \"porous\" cultures, such as those characterizing the U.S., Italy, and Brazil, reflect weaker social norms and greater permissiveness [27] .\"Q\u01d0 r\u00e9n y\u014du ti\u0101n\" from ancient China is a tale about a person who worried every day the sky would collapse. This study found that in the COVID-19 epidemic there was pervasive over-prevention among members of the public. Excessive prevention consumes too much personal energy and societal resources, and hence impedes disease control and economic recovery. Government and society at large must give this issue more attention.",
