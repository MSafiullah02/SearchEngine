Based on these observations, we hypothesize that N protein expressed in viral infected cells may be a potent mediator of the body\u2019s immune system, and thus N protein may be a potential target for SARS-Cov vaccine. To address this issue, we detected N protein-specific immune response by use of DNA vaccine and, as expected, found that DNA vaccination with N protein could induce specific antibody and specific CTLs. Our results implicates that SARS N protein may be a target for DNA vaccination.",

At the 5\u2032(ATG) and 3\u2032(TAA) ends of full coding region, EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were introduced respectively for subcloning into pGEM3Z. The resultant plasmid (pGEM-fn) was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and a 1.2 kb released fragment was then ligated to pcDNA3.1 vector digested with the same enzymes. The recombinant plasmid (pcDN-fn) could express full length N protein in mammalian cells and was used as a DNA vaccine. pcDNA3.1 vector was used for vaccination control. To express recombinant SARS N protein in Escherichia coli for polyclonal antibody preparation, we used pfu DNA polymearase chain reaction with primer pair P1 (5\u2032-GAATTCATATGTCTGATAATGGACCCC-3\u2032) and P2 (5\u2032-AAGGATCCTTATGCCTGAGTTGAATCAG-3\u2032), and modified the SARS n gene in pGEM-fn by introducing NdeI and BamHI site to the 5\u2032 end and 3\u2032 end, respectively. pET-fn expression plasmid was made by ligating the NdeI/BamHI n gene fragment into pET24a vector digested with NdeI and BamHI. To make an expression plasmid of truncated N protein, pET-fn was cut with HindIII and BamHI to remove the region from 121 to 422 aa and then self ligated after blunting the ends by Klenow large fragment. The resultant plasmid (pET-pn) was able to express truncated N protein in E. coli. All constructs are summarized in Fig. 1\n.",

The results of Western blot assay showed that these two proteins could also react with the serum antibody of mice immunized with pcDN-fn DNA vaccine as shown in Fig. 2C. We purified the recombinant proteins by DEAE-A50 absorption and SDS-PAGE gel extraction method. The resultant pure proteins were injected into New Zealand rabbits for polyclonal antibody preparation and two kinds of antibodies (FN-Ab, anti-full length N protein, and PN-Ab, anti-partial N protein) were obtained. The titration of both antibodies was over 1:30,000 averagely.",

DNA vaccination has been used to express antigens in vivo for the generation of both humoral and cellular immune responses, and is a promising therapy, especially for life-threatening diseases. In this report, we detected SARS-Cov N protein-specific immune response induced by DNA vaccination and found that specific antibody titres were as high as 1:4580 and specific CTL activities were also high. These results indicate that N protein which, naturally exists in virus particles in after binding of viral RNA, was able to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses when induced by DNA vaccine, and it might be a prospective candidate gene for development of SARS-Cov vaccine.",

They suggest the requirement of nucleocapsid protein for virus-specific antibody generation. This point was also supported by the data of TGEV [10]. Together with our results, therefore, we believed that SARS-Cov N protein was of importance not only for enhancement of antibody production but also for specific CTL generation, and N protein was an important target for SARS vaccine.",

Our results in this study showed that level of antibody generation (1:985) after immunization with two injections was much lower than that of three injections (1:4580), but the CTL activity already reached a high level.
