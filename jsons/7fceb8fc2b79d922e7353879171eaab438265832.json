However, reports indicate that the post-mortem inspection of pre-slaughter of apparently healthy animals detects only 20% of all the macroscopic lesions that are actually present in 1% or less of animals. On the other hand, food animals also carry pathogenic microorganisms in their gastrointestinal tract and/or on coat without any signs of disease ante-mortem, or visible lesions post-mortem. During slaughter and dressing procedures, these pathogens, including E. coli O157 and other VTEC, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and Listeria monocytogenes, can be directly or indirectly transferred onto the meat surface, but will not be visible to the meat inspection staff during conventional meat inspection of sheep/goats. In addition, it is recognised that physical meat inspection involving palpation and incision (as required under 64/433/EEC) increases the risk of cross-contamination of the meat with these organisms. Therefore some modified approaches are needed so as to reduce meat inspection-mediated cross-contamination of meat, whilst improving or at least maintaining the efficacy of the conventional post-mortem inspection of lambs and goat kids.",

This approach is only possible where the lambs and goat kids originate from, and are reared and finished in an integrated production system. The production systems in EU member states are complex, involve different production stages conducted at different farms and may require lambs to move from one farm to another for different stages of production. Nevertheless, the opinion takes note of the previous 2 of 49 opinions in the series 2 and considers that an integrated production system, incorporating integrated quality assurance implemented along the entire production chain, for lambs and goat kids is possible. Furthermore, it can result in a higher proportion of animals of a lower public health risk being presented for slaughter.",

In other words, within an integrated production system, and given the age at slaughter, lambs and goat kids are less exposed to infective agents, are not or less likely to develop the lesions more frequently seen at slaughter in older animals. The main conditions seen post-mortem in lambs and goat kids include emaciation, oedema, colour changes, tumours, haemorrhages, bruises, arthritis, septicaemia, etc., which can be diagnosed by visual inspection only.",

In such cases, palpations/incisions may be necessary and the Official Veterinarian has an important role in the decision to incise or to take samples that might be necessary for laboratory examination.

There are essentially three kinds of farming: sheep raised exclusively for meat and wool (typical for Australia, New Zealand, South America, some areas of Europe), fat-tailed non-Merino breeds bred only for meat (Africa) and dairy sheep farming (Mediterranean basin). The meat production in Europe reflects the diverse farming systems. For instance, in Italy the ovine meat production comes from milk-lambs (agnelli da latte) (65%), light and heavy lambs (agnelli leggeri e pesanti), agnelloni (5-6 months old lambs) (25%) and older animals (10%). In France lambs born from milking ewes are sold for rearing and fattening in rearing farms and represent integrated system lambs. They come from several farms and are sent to several fattening farms where they are reared until they are sent to the slaughterhouse. The batch of lambs sent to the slaughterhouse is made up of lambs originating either in only one fattening farm or may be from several fattening farms. Lambs born from \"meat ewes\" are reared on the dam and often have a quality label. On the other hand, as in Spain, lambs may come from either milk or meat flocks.

This is particularly relevant for diseases with multifactorial causation, where the immune status is a major factor, such as pneumonia caused by Mannheimia spp. and Pasteurella spp. Transport also can increase the level and/or duration of shedding of pathogens, as well as the surface contamination of animals with pathogens via animal-animal or animalenvironment-animal contacts in the vehicle, on the market, or in the lairage. Therefore, it can be assumed that the food/meat safety risks increase as the number/frequency of movements of animals between farm and slaughter increase (SCVPH, veal calves inspection, 2003) . Routine cleaning and sanitation of transport vehicles and/or lairages to a visually clean standard is necessary, but may not entirely eliminate pathogens e.g. Salmonella spp. or VTEC O157:H7 from related surfaces (Oosterom et al., 1983; Swanenburg et al., 2001; Small et al., 2002) .",

The following Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 collate the diseases that can be diagnosed on postmortem inspection of lambs and goats. Not all the diseases mentioned in the tables are important for meat safety. Indeed, a number of them are not of public health significance but can be important for animal health surveillance or for meat acceptability. Pathological conditions of the lymph nodes (inflammatory, degenerative, hyperplasia) are not always of public health significance but changes in the lymph nodes are useful indicators of the presence of disease. The number of nodes undergoing pathological changes is a reliable indicator of the extent of a disease. It has to be remembered, however, that in rapidly growing young animals lymph nodes are rather prominent and contain more fluid compared with old animals. The finding of a pathological condition in some lymph nodes, therefore, assists in establishing if the process is acute or chronic and if there has been spread to involve the entire carcass. The pathological change seen with generalised lymphadenitis could be related to septicaemia if acute and to toxic pathologies if chronic. Both cases imply a potential risk for public health. Routine incision of pancreatic, gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes is not advisable, due to the risk of spreading bacterial contamination.",

Until the lamb is completely weaned, its feeding behaviour is very similar to that of monogastric animals as only the abomasum is working and its volume is 70% of the total gastric apparatus. Milk bypasses the forestomachs through the closure mechanisms of the reticular groove which connects the oesophagus directly with the abomasum.",

Water soluble vitamins (B1, B2), mineral (Mg, Co, Cu), amino acids (lysine, methionine) may be added. Antibiotics (virginyamicin, flavomycin, bacitramycin, spiramycin) are added to prevent neonatal infections. Weaning is the transition period when the animals move from a diet of milk to solid feed. This may be forage such as grass, silage or hay, or concentrates. It may be also the moment when the lamb is separated from the ewe as in the case of natural suckling, but not necessarily. In artificial suckling, the lamb is separated from the ewe at the end of the colostrum phase, i.e. a few days after birth. Weaning may be gradual with 15-20 days of adaptation or brusque. Weaning varies according to the system of farming used.",

It results in enteritis and/or enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes often with haemorrhages. Although the infection mostly occurs in the first few weeks or months (kids) via in-utero transmission, faecal contamination, or colostrum/milk, there may be a significant period (up to 3 years) of sub-clinical shedding before development of clinical disease. Diagnosis of paratuberculosis by blood tests, e.g. Complement fixation test (CFT), Agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGIDT) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) is possible. Human infection would have occurred primarily via milk, although there is still a controversy whether association between Johne's disease (in animals) and Crohn's disease (in humans) really exists. Rift Valley fever (Virus family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus) is a disease in sheep/goats in Africa, but is not present in the EU. Clinically, lambs show fever with mortality rates of 20% (>1 week age) to 90% (<1 week), with post-mortem findings including focal or generalised hepatic necrosis, widespread cutaneous haemorrhages, lesions on lymph nodes, and haemorrhagic enteritis. This result in a major zoonoses in affected areas, and human infections occur via nasal discharge, blood, vaginal secretions, infected meat, as well as via mosquitoes. BSE, if it should be found under natural conditions in sheep and goats, would constitute a significant risk to human health. In susceptible genotypes, the whole animal should then be considered as risk material.Zoonotic agents potentially causing human infections via other routes Q-Fever is a disease, primarily causing abortions in adult sheep, caused by Coxiella burnetii. Aborted lambs and placentae contain high numbers of organisms, and human infection usually occurs via inhalation of contaminated dust (afterbirth, urine, faeces) but via milk as well.",
