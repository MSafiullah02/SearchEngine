Results of BAL assays are used to make clinical decisions that may impact outcomes. Clinicians have reported that COVID-19 patients had bacterial and fungal pulmonary coinfections1 with potential pathogens including Escherichia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas.2 Recent research suggests that COVID-19 coinfections are associated with significantly higher mortality rates.3\n",

At one hospital, high protein levels were detected in 7 of 8 bronchoscopes, indicating that manual cleaning failed to remove soil.7 Visual inspections using magnification and borescopes identified residue or defects in 100% of bronchoscopes.7,8 Audits evaluating personal protective equipment use and reprocessing guideline adherence (eg, point-of-care precleaning; leak testing; manual cleaning; visual inspection; cleaning verification; high-level disinfection; rinsing; drying; storage; transport and handling) identified breaches in all 5 hospitals.7-9 Technicians in 2 hospitals (sites 1 and 5) performed most reprocessing steps correctly, but bronchoscopes at both sites harbored S. maltophilia due to contaminated rinse water.7,9 In 3 hospitals (sites 2\u20134), nearly all steps were performed incorrectly or were skipped entirely.7,8 In light of these breaches and observations that most bronchoscopes were damaged and contaminated, a recommendation was made that procedures in 2 hospitals be halted until strict protocols could be implemented and personnel retrained. In addition, it was recommended that badly damaged bronchoscopes be removed from service and replaced with single-use, sterile bronchoscopes or new reusable bronchoscopes constructed with sterilizable materials.",

Given the high bronchoscope contamination rates found during routine use in previous studies, we must now consider the possibility of bronchoscopy-associated transmission of COVID-19 or other pathogens that could cause secondary infections. Theoretically, high-level disinfection should eliminate these risks when bronchoscopes are well-maintained and reprocessed according to manufacturer instructions and professional guidelines. However, even during normal patient loads, practices are frequently substandard, and pathogens are commonly present on patient-ready endoscopes. The presence of gastrointestinal pathogens found in bronchoscopes and BAL samples suggests the possibility of cross-contamination caused by intermingling bronchoscopes and gastrointestinal endoscopes during reprocessing. This hypothesis is supported by findings at one hospital where protein and bioburden levels on brand-new bronchoscopes increased significantly following manual cleaning prior to any clinical use.7\n",

Laboratory methods should include bacterial/fungal cultures and molecular assays (eg, real-time PCR) for respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. To optimize the accuracy of results, samples should be taken from multiple components using a friction-based technique (eg, flush-brush-flush for sampling ports and channels). Laboratories should utilize methods that foster growth of microbes that are viable but not easily culturable (eg, using neutralizers to counteract residual reprocessing chemicals that could suppress growth, concentrating samples, and/or incubating for at least 5\u20137 days or 6\u20138 weeks when culturing for Mycobacteria). Due to the relative insensitivity of viral culture and potential safety concerns related to cultivating COVID-19, molecular testing (ie, targeted real-time PCR and multiplex respiratory panels) could be considered to assess contamination with viral pathogens.",
