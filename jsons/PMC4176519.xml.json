As the rhesus macaque genome sequence first became available in 2007 1, several draft macaque genomes have been published 2, 3. However, due to the lack of extensive species\u2010specific transcriptional data, the annotation of macaque genomes has heavily relied on sequence homology\u2010based strategies, usually referenced against available human annotation 1, 2, 3. These human\u2010centric and largely automated approaches have been successful in annotating the core set of well\u2010conserved protein\u2010coding transcripts, but much less efficient for annotating the complex alternatively spliced isoforms and less\u2010conserved non\u2010coding RNAs (ncRNAs).",

RNAseq has enabled the discovery of tens of thousands of unknown transcripts in mammalian transcriptomes, as exemplified by the huge number of novel isoforms and ncRNAs recently uncovered in the human transcriptome by the ENCODE project 5. To assist NHP genome annotation, we produced large\u2010scale RNAseq data for each of fifteen NHP species 6 and fully released the raw sequencing data through the Nonhuman Primate Reference Transcriptome Resource (NHPRTR) website (http://nhprtr.org).",

We de novo assembled sequencing reads which were not aligned to the reference genomes and found that many of the assembled transcript contigs corresponded to macaque transcripts \u2018missing\u2019 from current macaque genome assemblies. In addition, we discovered un\u2010annotated non\u2010polyadenylated intergenic transcripts exclusively from RNAseq analysis of total RNAs. We used this set of new annotation to analyze RNAseq data collected from macaque virus infection studies and show that a large number of newly identified transcripts were differentially expressed during SIV infection of rhesus macaques or during Ebola virus infection of cynomolgus macaques. Together, these results demonstrate the biological relevance of newly identified transcripts and the importance of improving macaque annotations.",

To speed up this read mapping step, we first aligned the cleaned reads to the reference genome using the fast mapper Bowtie. Then we aligned the remaining unmapped reads to the same reference genomes using the sensitive gapped aligner GSNAP 8, which detects reads spanning splicing junctions. GSNAP also allows short insertions and deletions, which covers both genetic variations and potential errors in the reference genome assembly.",

Using UCSC nets and chains tools, we initially classified the hg19\u2010aligned contigs into three distinct categories that explain their absence from rheMac2: completely missing (the contig does not align to rheMac2 but the hg19 alignment spans the entire contig), partially missing (the contig does not align to rheMac2 but the hg19 alignment partially spans the contig), and no human\u2013rhesus genome alignment (the contig aligns to a region in hg19 that has no available genome alignment with rheMac2).

Next we used HTSeq (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html) to obtain raw read counts for all TARs and reference\u2010annotated genes. We normalized the raw read counts by the corresponding total read count, that is, the sum of raw read counts of all genes/TARs. For each gene/TAR, we calculated a metric Rtm, which was defined as the ratio between the minimum of normalized total RNAseq read counts and the maximum of normalized mRNAseq read counts. We calculated the distributions of the Rtms for genes/TARs from different annotation sources. We chose a threshold for Rtm which showed the best separation between different annotation sources. We selected the subset of TARs which had much higher Rtms as un\u2010annotated intergenic transcripts derived from total RNAseq data, that is, they were assembled only from total RNAseq data and highly enriched in total RNAseq data.",

This was accomplished by using complementary mRNAseq (mature polyadenylated mRNAs) and total RNAseq (rRNA depleted total RNAs) protocols 6. Considering the large volume of the RNAseq dataset and the draft quality of available macaque genomes, we devised a streamlined analytic strategy to reconstruct macaque transcripts from the large\u2010scale macaque RNAseq data (Fig. 1). Our strategy combined reference mapping with genetic variation aware steps and de novo transcript assembly. Also, mRNAseq data and total RNAseq data were processed independently and then contrasted to uncover non\u2010polyadenylated transcripts.",

As shown in Table 1, for rhesus macaque, we identified 59,116 novel isoforms for 13,344 annotated genes and 4783 intergenic transcriptionally active regions (TAR, due to the inability to define the actual gene start and end boundaries). For cynomolgus macaque, we identified relatively fewer novel isoforms for reference\u2010annotated genes but many more intergenic TARs. This was likely due to more genes annotated for rhesus plus the lower RNAseq coverage for the cynomolgus macaque genome (Table 1 in 6).

But the coding potentials between novel isoforms and intergenic transcripts were very different (Fig. 3B). About 90% of novel isoforms were predicted to be protein coding, while about 80% of intergenic transcripts were predicted to be non\u2010coding. Similar observations for cynomolgus macaque transcripts are shown in Fig. 3C, D. This shows that most of these intergenic transcripts are likely to be long non\u2010coding RNAs. This also suggests that in general macaque protein\u2010coding genes were much better covered by the reference annotations, while the annotations of non\u2010coding RNAs were very insufficient and can be improved by leveraging RNAseq data as collected here.",

It turned out that 95% of these rhesus contigs were aligned to the alignment blocks where the rhesus genome assembly had gaps (Fig. 5A). In reference to the human annotation, these contigs overlapped 2272 annotated human genes, 52 of which were completely covered by these contigs. As an example (Fig. 6), the human gene CD1C was completely covered by multiple de novo assembled rhesus macaque contigs, representing potentially novel isoforms, while located within a gap in the rhesus genome assembly spanning the whole gene. Interestingly, these rhesus transcript contigs even extended beyond the annotation of the human CD1C gene, suggesting the UTR annotation of this human gene might not be complete either. Overall, for most of these human genes, these macaque contigs covered a relatively small portion (10\u201320%) of their exonic regions (Fig. 5B), suggesting the current rhesus macaque assembly contained many, but mostly relatively small, gaps or errors. In summary, our results show the RNAseq data contain many macaque transcript sequences which are missing from current macaque genome assemblies, and we were able to successfully recover these macaque transcripts using the analytical strategies developed here.",

To do so, we first assembled macaque transcripts from the total RNAseq data independently and then applied an in silico subtraction strategy. The subtraction strategy included the following: (i) the removal of those total RNAseq\u2010derived transcripts overlapping any mRNAseq\u2010derived transcripts or reference\u2010annotated transcripts and (ii) the removal of those total RNAseq\u2010derived transcripts that did not show higher expression abundance as quantified by total RNAseq compared to mRNAseq.",

As shown in Fig. 7A, B, TARs derived from total RNAseq data alone were well separated from mRNAseq\u2010derived TARs based on the metric Rtm, for both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Total RNAseq\u2010derived TARs tended to have much higher Rtm, an indication that these TARs were transcribing non\u2010polyadenylated transcripts which were not adequately captured by mRNAseq. Two examples are shown in Fig. 7C, D. As expected, mRNAseq\u2010derived TARs had similar distributions of Rtms as reference\u2010annotated genes, as current macaque reference annotations mostly cover protein\u2010coding genes, which mostly transcribe polyadenylated transcripts. In addition, the coding potential analysis also showed that these total RNAseq\u2010derived transcripts were predominantly non\u2010coding (Fig. 3B, D). In summary, these results show that through RNAseq analysis of total RNAs, we were able to uncover thousands of TARs which were enriched with non\u2010polyadenylated non\u2010coding RNAs.

Barrenas, R.E. Palermo, B. Agricola, M.B. Agy, L. Aicher, V. Carter, L. Flanary, R.R. Green, R. McLain, Q. Li, W. Lu, R. Murnane, X. Peng, M.J. Thomas, J.M. Weiss, D.M. Anderson, M.G. Katze in preparation). We detected (one or more uniquely mapped reads in all 12 samples) the expressions of 2181 mRNAseq\u2010derived TARs. Out of these detected TARs, 245 were differentially expressed (fold change >1.5 and raw P\u2010value <0.05) between base line samples and samples from infected animals collected as early as day 3 and/or 6 post\u2010infection, and 135 of them had a false discovery rate <0.05. An example of a differentially expressed rhesus macaque TAR is shown in Fig. 8A.

This suggests that most macaque protein\u2010coding genes have been reliably identified by sequence homology\u2010based approaches, whereas non\u2010coding RNAs are less likely to be identified by such approaches due to their weaker sequence conservation 14. The biological relevance of ncRNAs is rapidly emerging in many research areas, including in HIV/AIDS research. For example, our recent RNAseq studies have found the expression of many ncRNAs is related to virus infection, including mice infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) 15 and human CD4+ T cells infected by HIV\u20101 16. Zhang et al. 17 reported that the knockdown of the long ncRNA NEAT1 enhances HIV\u20101 production by increasing the export of Rev\u2010dependent instability element\u2010containing HIV\u20101 mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here we also showed that many newly identified intergenic transcripts were differentially expressed during SIV infection of rhesus macaques or during Ebola virus infection of cynomolgus macaques.

We found that the majority of these missing macaque transcripts only partially cover homologous human genes, based on their placement on the macaque\u2013human genome alignments. This suggests that the current rhesus macaque genome assembly has already covered most macaque genes, but likely with relatively small \u2018holes\u2019 for many genes, mainly due to its draft quality. As currently most sequenced genomes are of draft quality, there is a great need for systematic and continuous improvements of these genome assemblies.

To speed up the process, the fast mapper Bowtie was first used to quickly place un\u2010spliced reads onto the genome. Un\u2010mapped reads were then aligned using the gapped aligner GSNAP, which also allowed indels. Step 3, macaque transcripts were reconstructed with mapped reads ab initio using Cufflinks, independent of reference annotation. Step 4, newly constructed macaque transcripts were compared against available reference annotation. Step 5, in parallel to Step 3, after GSNAP in Step 2, all un\u2010mapped reads were de novo assembled into transcript contigs using Trinity. Step 6, contigs were aligned to both the human and macaque genomes to identify transcripts not covered by the corresponding macaque reference genome. Right, the workflow for total RNAseq data.
