            "text": "The current recommended treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the combination of pegylated alpha interferon (IFN) and ribavirin given for 24 or 48 weeks.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n Both viral and host factors may contribute to the phenomenon that some patients with chronic hepatitis C respond well to IFN therapy but others do not.\n4\n, \n5\n Specifically, viral factors, such as genotype 1 and high HCV RNA levels are associated with a higher incidence of resistance to IFN therapy. Also, host factors, such as old age, advanced fibrosis, long duration of disease and host genetic factors can adversely influence the response to IFN treatment.\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n The host genetic factors mediate the vigor of the immune response of the host through the control of inter\u2010individual differences in the production of intracellular antiviral proteins or some cytokines.\n9\n, \n10\n These inter\u2010individual differences may be attributable to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome, which significantly influence the progression of chronic HCV infection and response to therapy.\n11\n, \n12\n Biological activity of IFN therapy is mediated by the induction of intracellular antiviral proteins, such as 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), dsRNA activated protein kinase (PKR) and MxA protein.\n6\n, \n13\n, \n14\n The 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 OAS protein has selective activity against several viruses. It requires double stranded (ds) RNA structures, such as viral genomes, to become activated. The activated enzyme then catalyzes the polymerization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into 2\u2032,5\u2032 linked oligoadenylates, and these, in turn, bind to and activate latent ribonuclease L (RNaseL), which degrades viral RNA and inhibits protein synthesis. The 2\u2032\u20105\u2032 OAS\u2010RNaseL system may also be involved in growth and apoptosis.\n15\n, \n16\n The 2\u2032\u20105\u2032\u2010oligoadenylate synthetase genes comprise a gene family (OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3). The OAS1 gene, located on human chromosome 12q24.2, encodes the p42, p44, p46, and p48 isoforms.\n17\n The importance of OAS1 for clearing viral infections has been demonstrated in different studies.\n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n In humans, it was reported that basal activity of OAS1 varies among individuals and is associated with susceptibility to diabetes mellitus type 1, whose pathogenesis is thought to involve enterovirus infections.\n21\n Furthermore, previous analysis of human OAS1 response to yellow fever vaccine revealed a highly significant correlation between basal enzyme activity and virus\u2010stimulated activity measured 7 days after vaccination.\n22\n Actually, in HCV patients, several findings were reported regarding OAS1 (i) HCV core protein specifically activated the 40/46\u2010kDa OAS1 gene promoter in a dose\u2010dependent manner in different human hepatocyte derived cell lines. (ii) The activation by core protein was further enhanced in the cells treated with alpha interferon.\n23\n (iii) The induced levels of OAS1 were lower in poor\u2010responder patients than in marked\u2010 or intermediate\u2010responder patients.\n24\n Thus, any genetic variants that affect OAS1 activity could be important determinants of susceptibility/resistance to antiviral treatment and to virus\u2010related disease progression. Although OAS1 is critical in antiviral interaction, its sequence is not strictly conserved. There are eight SNPs in exons, 24 SNPs in introns, three in promoters and one in the 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region (UTR) of the OAS1 gene. It was reported that more than 12 genetic markers in OAS1 were strongly associated with enzyme activity.\n21\n, \n25\n The strongest genetic association with OAS1 activity occurred at exon 7 SAS of the OAS1 gene, in which the sequence AG is required for normal splicing at this site. The G allele at this acceptor site retains the splice site and is associated with high enzyme activity p46, whereas the A allele (AA at acceptor site) ablates the splice site and is associated with low enzyme activity p48 and p52.\n25\n Ghosh et al.\n26\n reported that the basal OAS1 activity is higher in persons carrying the G (p46) allele than in those having only the A (p48/p52) allele. These findings suggest strong genetic control of OAS1 basal activity and the genetic polymorphism at exon 7 SAS makes OAS1 an excellent candidate for a human gene that can significantly influence the host susceptibility to viral infection, affect the disease progression and the response to IFN therapy in patients with hepatitis C or hepatitis B viral infection.\n10\n, \n27\n, \n28\n In the present study, we investigated 70 Egyptian HCV genotype 4a infected patients and 50 healthy individuals as controls to determine if the genetic SNP in the exon 7 SAS of the human OAS1 gene is associated with reduced response to IFN based therapy.",

Subjects were all Egyptians and unrelated to each other. Informed consent was obtained from each subject before collecting blood samples. All HCV patients were positive for both anti\u2010HCV antibody and serum HCV RNA by reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). All patients were infected with HCV genotype 4a as detected by (INNO\u2010LiPA HCV; Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium). Viral RNA quantifications were performed using (Copus Amplicore HCV monitor test, Roche, Pleasanton, CA, USA). IFN treatment and clinical follow\u2010ups were performed at the Department of Tropical Medicine, Kasr El Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Prior to the start of the IFN therapy, patients had persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels for at least 6 months and none of them had evidence of metabolic liver diseases, alcohol\u2010induced, drug\u2010induced or autoimmune hepatitis, thyroid hypo\u2010 or hyper\u2010function, or active schistosomiasis infection. A pretreatment liver biopsy was carried out for histopathological examination and assessment of the stages of fibrosis according to the Metavir Score.\n29\n Patients were treated with interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for 48 weeks. They received 20\u2010kDa linear pegylated (PEG) IFN\u03b1\u20102a derived from Hansenula Polymorpha expression system (MinaPharm\u2010Rhein Company, 10th of Ramadan City, Egypt), taken once a week at 160 \u00b5g s.c., in addition to oral ribavirin taken daily in a dose of 1000\u20131200 mg (according to body weight). Patients were followed for at least 6 months after completion of therapy. Sustained virological responders (SVR; n = 31) were defined as patients who tested negative for HCV RNA (using both nested RT\u2010PCR and real\u2010time PCR) for at least 6 months after end of treatment (ETR) to combined therapy. All other patients, who did not show SVR, were considered non\u2010responders (NR; n = 39).",

During the chronic infection, some patients have minimal progression of disease, whereas others develop severe liver disease such as elevated transaminase levels, chronic hepatitis, steatosis, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.\n33\n Both host and viral factors are thought to influence HCV disease outcome and response to IFN treatment. Since more than 93% of patients in Egypt are infected with HCV genotype 4\n34\n it seemed more applicable to carry out the current study on patients infected with genotype 4a who receive the pegylated IFN + ribavirin at doses mentioned in the methods section. Host genetic factors that affect the outcome of IFN treatment in chronic hepatitis C have been investigated. Several SNPs in IFN\u2010inducible genes leading to altered gene expression or function were found to be associated with divergent responses to IFN treatment.\n28\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n Understanding which patients are likely to develop persistent infection, progressive liver disease or not responding significantly to interferon therapy would be of utmost importance in disease control programs. In this study we showed that a specific human mutation that results in reduced function in a known antiviral gene OAS1 is associated with resistance to interferon therapy in HCV infected patients. OAS1 codes for a component of the type I interferon signaling system; its homolog in mice has been shown previously to be important for flavivirus susceptibility.\n38\n Our observations suggested that polymorphisms at exon 7 splice\u2010acceptor site in the OAS1 gene may be involved in determining the outcome of HCV infection. Patients harboring GG genotype at this site tend to achieve sustained response to interferon therapy (59.4%) suggesting that the G allele conferred a better signaling towards viral clearance. On the other hand, a clear association exists between both allele A containing genotypes, that is GA and AA and resistance to interferon therapy (62% and 89%, respectively). These findings confirmed earlier reports that the G allele at this acceptor site retained the splice site and was associated with a higher OAS enzyme activity (P46), whereas the A allele (AA at acceptor site) ablated the splice site and resulted in a larger molecular weight protein with a lower OAS enzyme activity (P48).\n25\n, \n26\n The role of OAS enzyme activity in combating other viral infections has been previously documented, a SNP in exon 3 of OAS1 was related to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, a coronavirus infection).\n10\n Recently, Lim et al.\n39\n reported that individuals carrying two copies of the hypofunctional variant of OAS1 were found more frequently than expected among both asymptomatic and symptomatic West Nile Virus (WNV) positive individuals and further proved that OAS1 activity influences the probability of WNV initial infection upon exposure in man.",

Knapp et al.\n37\n reported that different genotypes at specific SNPs within the 3\u2032UTR of OAS1 gene were not associated with differential response to IFN therapy but more likely were associated with persistent infection of patients. Moreover, Li et al.\n40\n showed no relationship of a SNP in exon 3 of OAS1 gene and IFN treatment response. Okuno et al., Solinas et al. and Pawlotsky et al.\n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n hypothesized that OAS1 plays a greater role in mediating self\u2010limiting versus persistent HCV infections as a component of the innate immune system and an IFN stimulated gene than its role in exogenously administered IFN treatment. The current data support this hypothesis, since the SNP allele (AA or GA) of the OAS1 gene was slightly overrepresented in HCV patients (13%, 42%) compared with the controls (9%, 38%, respectively). This finding indicates that OAS1 plays a role in persistence of HCV infection.",

It was presumed that GA and AA genotypes could negatively affect the suppressive function of OAS of HCV replication, and may therefore be related to sustained inflammation and progression of liver disease. This hypothesis was supported by results of the present study in which the hepatic fibrosis score was higher in AA and GA genotypes compared with the GG genotype. Chronic HCV patients with positive A allele had significantly higher fibrosis scores (\u2265 F2 metavir) than those observed in patients without A allele (88.9% in AA and 62% in GA vs 43.7% in GG, P = 0.05). Interestingly, fibrosis scores were higher in OAS variants including allele A at exon 7 SAS in a gene dose\u2010dependent fashion; that is, the more A allele in OAS exon 7 SAS, the more F score in a patient's liver. On the other hand there was no significant association between different OAS genotypes and liver activity (P = 0.22). This may be explained by the fact that A allele encodes p48 with a weak ability to suppress HCV replication compared with OAS1 having G allele coding for the more active enzyme p46.\n25\n Thus, the presence here of A allele may lead to a higher degree of necrosis, regeneration and ultimately higher degree of fibrosis. These latter findings support the previous results of Li et al.\n40\n who found that the SNP of OAS\u20101 at exon 3 was associated with disease progression in Japanese patients with HCV infection. In general, the effects of different OAS genotypes on the liver disease progression in HCV patients need to be further studied.",

It is possible that other host proteins with different functions may also be associated, via diverse mechanisms, with the response to IFN in chronic HCV patients. The present multivariate analysis results indicate that the OAS1 gene polymorphism is not the only factor that influences the IFN\u2010induced antiviral activities of host cells against viral infection. However, multivariate analysis showed that the SNP of OAS\u20101 at the exon 7 splice acceptor site as independent and significant determinants of the outcome of IFN therapy (odds ratio 4.913 [95% confidence interval 1.365\u20138.2], P = 0.006).
