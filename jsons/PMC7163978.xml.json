            "text": "To test the hypothesis that activation of IERSR enhances L. amazonensis infection, we treated RAW 264.7 macrophages for 1 h with thapsigargin (TG), a well\u2010known inhibitor of sarcoendoreticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) channels that causes ER stress by depleting ER\u2010Ca2+ stores, followed by infection with L. amazonensis for 48 h. The infection index showed that activation of ER stress increased the parasite burden compared with that in non treated cells (Fig. \n1\n\nA). This finding suggests that 1 or more components of the IERSR enhance parasite infection. To elucidate the molecular effectors of IERSR that enhance L. amazonensis infection, we first investigated the possible involvement of IFN1, because our earlier work had demonstrated that L. amazonensis induces IFN1\u2010\u03b2 expression and that this cytokine plays an important role in L. amazonensis growth (3) and because of the known role of XBP1 in IFN\u20101b expression (12, 13). Our results indicated that enhanced parasite growth in TG\u2010treated macrophages was dependent on type I IFNAR (Fig. 1\nB). Primary macrophages with IFNAR deletion showed reduced L. amazonensis infection compared with that in WT counterparts after treatment with TG. We also observed a cooperative effect of TG treatment and L. amazonensis infection on IFN1\u2010\u03b2 expression in a qPCR assay (Fig. 1\nC). Finally, TG treatment did not enhance the infection in TLR2\u2010KO macrophages (Supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that this agent enhances parasite infectivity in a TLR2\u2010dependent manner.",

We evaluated these transduced cells for XBP1 silencing with a qPCR assay (Fig. \n4\n\nA). We further confirmed qPCR results by Western blot analysis of transduced cell extracts (Fig. 4\nB). Based on these results, we selected cells transduced with an shXBP1 lentivirus that yielded the highest level of XBP1silencing (~90%) for evaluating the role of XBP1 in L. amazonensis infection. Our infection index assays demonstrated that shXBP1 knockdown cells significantly reduced the L. amazonensis burden when compared with their scrambled shRNA\u2013transduced counterparts similarly infected with this parasite (Fig. 4\nC). These data demonstrate clearly that XBP1 plays a critical role in the infection of macrophages by L. amazonensis.\n",

The phagocytosis of parasites during infection creates an oxidative burst and induces the formation of ROS that act as a cellular defense against the parasite (20). However, L. amazonensis parasites subvert these defense mechanisms to survive inside macrophages. To determine whether XBP\u20101 plays a role in subversion of host antioxidant defenses, we first determined the NO concentration in shXBP1\u2010 or scrambled shRNA\u2013transduced cells. In these studies we observed that knocking down XBP1 expression increased nitrite concentration during L. amazonensis infection (Fig. \n6\n\nA). To further support the emerging hypothesis that sXBP1 protects cells from oxidative stress during L. amazonensis infection, we added NAC, an antioxidant agent, to shXBP1 cells infected with L. amazonensis and measured parasite growth. As expected, the addition of the antioxidant NAC significantly increased the parasite burden in shXBP1 macrophages (Fig. 6\nB). Consistently, the shXBP1 transduced cells also showed a decrease in HO\u20101 protein levels compared with scrambled shRNA\u2013transduced cells during L. amazonensis infection. These data further support our hypothesis that XBP1 plays an important role in regulating HO\u20101 expression and ROS levels during parasite infection (Fig. 6\nC).

In response, the pathogens have developed sophisticated approaches for evading hosts' defenses. In this never\u2010ending arms race between the host and the pathogen, pathogens very often hijack host defenses for survival. Leishmania is a pathogenic protozoan that successfully infects ~1 million people a year in Central and South America, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. Several studies have shown that this parasite may subvert elements of innate immunity for survival and proliferation in mammalian hosts (21, 22). For example L. amazonensis induces IFN\u20101\u03b2 expression in a TLR2\u2010dependent manner (3), which appears to favor parasite growth. Similarly, IFNAR signaling favors L. amazonensis (4). L. amazonensis also subverts the ROS defense mechanism. Our group also showed that L. amazonensis suppresses NO production through iNOS repression in an NF\u2010kB transcription\u2010factor\u2014dependent manner (5). Moreover, L. amazonensis infection induces SOD\u20101, thus favoring parasite growth by reducing ROS accumulation (3). How L. amazonensis induces such responses to evade host defenses in a coordinated manner remains poorly understood.",

XBP1 is a critical component of the IERSR, which induces the expression of ER chaperones and components of ERAD. Furthermore, sXBP1 is involved in processes not directly related to the IERSR response, such as gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and lipid metabolism (8). Finally, XBP1 is activated byTLR4 and \u20102 in macrophages, with an increase in IL\u20106, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IFN\u20101\u03b2 production in the absence of overt ER stress (11). XBP1 increases IFN\u20101\u03b2 expression after sequential treatment with TG followed by LPS, in a TLR4\u2010 and \u20103\u2010dependent manner (12). Induction of IFN\u20101\u03b2 by sXBP1 and the well\u2010established role of IFN signaling in L. amazonensis pathogenesis suggest that sXBP1 plays a role in this parasite's evasion of host defenses. Recent demonstration that Plasmodium infection of hepatocytes is associated with ER stress (23) and that XBP1 is critically important for parasite development in these cells (24) supports this hypothesis.",

In further studies, we demonstrated that L. amazonensis infection induces XBP1 binding to the Ifnb promoter with no epigenetic modifications of [3H]histone (acetylation). Furthermore, we observed the occupancy of the Ifnb enhancer site by XBP1, which is associated with Lys9 acetylation of [3H]histone on this site, suggesting that the enhancer site plays a critical role in Ifnb expression during parasite infection (Fig. 3). These studies confirm and expand findings in previous reports that treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with TG and LPS induce the occupancy of a newly described enhancer site, +6 kb, for Ifnb gene expression; however, those studies did not report Ifnb promoter occupancy by XBP1 (13).
