            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has challenged healthcare globally, resulting in over 1 million cases worldwide with an estimated mortality rate of 5 -10%. [1] [2] Although the clinical presentation is often mild-to-moderate in severity, many will develop critical disease that requires admission to an intensive care unit. [3] [4] [5] The severe clinical presentations in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) include adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The novelty of this infection, its infectious potential, and its clinical consequences have generated a surge in demand for critical care services that include unique considerations for echocardiography and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, both in adult and pediatric practice. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The purpose of this freestanding editorial is to highlight the challenges and considerations in the critical care response to COVID-19. The suggested strategies have outlined options for designing best practices to navigate the coronavirus crisis successfully. The provided references can also serve as a guide for policy leaders to frame their plans for meeting the demands of the pandemic at their respective institutions.",

            "text": "The hazards of advanced airway management, including endotracheal intubation, in patients with COVID-19 include infection due to the aerosolization of viral particles. 10 The focus on infection control during airway management in this setting for patients includes limited mask ventilation, full barrier precautions, limited operators, and dedicated airway teams. [11] [12] These important considerations apply to all aerosolizing procedures, including bronchoscopy and transesophageal 3 echocardiography, as well as the clinical care of these patients in the interventional suite and operating room environments. [10] [11] [12] [13] The leadership of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) services during this pandemic should design strategies to manage the personnel, equipment, facilities, and support systems for this life-saving therapy. 3-5; 14-15 Although ECMO has been recommended in COPVID-19 by the World Health Organization, recent guidelines from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization have highlighted that this modality should be employed in experienced centers as a rescue strategy for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. [3] [4] [5] Despite the recommended initial recommended approaches for adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19, overall oxygenation may deteriorate clinically as tracked by a falling blood oxygen tension/inspired oxygen ratio. [14] [15] When this important ratio drops below 150 mmHg, it should trigger consideration of the following acute care interventions to improve gas exchange: lung recruitment maneuvers, positive end-expiratory pressure titration, neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning. [3] [4] [5] Inhaled selective pulmonary vasodilators such as nitric oxide and epoprostenol may be considered in specialized centers to further optimize matching of ventilation and perfusion matching throughout ventilated lung areas. [3] [4] [5] If this ratio drops below 75 mmHg for 3-6 hours and/or the arterial pH persists below 7.25 with a carbon dioxide tension above 60 mmHg despite maximal medical therapy, then ECMO should be considered. [3] [4] [5] The contraindications for ECMO in patients with COVID-19 should be hospital-specific, with consideration of local factors such as team experience and resource availability. [14] [15] Clinical risk factors such as advanced age, frailty, prior lung disease, diabetes, heart failure, and immunosuppression may also qualify as contraindications to 4 ECMO. [14] [15] [16] The indications and contraindications to ECMO during the coronavirus crisis should be adjusted in real-time to local factors.",

            "text": "planning and procedures to withhold this resuscitation from patients in accordance with their wishes; and, finally, additional national guidance about these issues. [18] [19] As a response to this call for a national conversation, the American Heart Association has recently updated its guidelines for basic and advanced life support in light of COVID-19. 18 This multisociety guideline has recommended multiple adjustments to the protocols for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 3 major categories as follows: firstly, minimize provider exposure; secondly, emphasize airway and ventilation strategies to minimize aerosolization risk; and, thirdly, consider the appropriateness of resuscitation. [18] [19] In the first group of considerations about exposure control, this guideline has recommended clear and comprehensive communication, protocols for limiting personnel, meticulous utilization of personal protective equipment, and consideration of mechanical devices for chest compressions. 18 In the second group of considerations about control of aerosolization, the guideline has recommended airway filters, lower thresholds for endotracheal intubation, videolaryngoscopy, experienced operators, limiting of bag-and-mask ventilation, and minimizing disconnects of the closed circuit components. 18 In the third group of considerations about appropriateness of resuscitation, the expert consensus has recommended that the goals of care be addressed wherever possible, including institutional indications for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in This clarification about goals of care may require in put from the palliative care service in selected cases as part of a systematic institutional response to the COVID-19 pandemic. [21] [22] [23] In the event of cardiogenic shock refractory to medical management, consideration of mechanical circulatory support could be considered, including venoarterial ECMO. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The management of personnel in the delivery of ECMO services at an experienced center should be centralized with flexible staffing models to accommodate staff attrition. [3] [4] [5] Experienced centers may also have to advise referring centers to accommodate unique aspects of COVID-19, including referral indications, transport protocols, and infection control. [3] [4] [5] Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 who require cardiopulmonary support with ECMO may be grouped into cohorts in designated hospital areas that are appropriately resourced to care for these patients. [3] [4] [5] 3. Consider the Challenges in Surge Planning for Critical Care 6 The preparation process for the critical care demands of the COVID-19 can be structured according to established models for pandemics with due consideration of the general parameters and relevant specific parameters such as high-risk populations. [24] [25] The management of the critical care service line during the coronavirus crisis should ideally be part of the coordinated response from the health system. [24] [25] The magnitude of the expected surge can be classified into 3 phases (3C response model: conventional/contingency/crisis). 24 The first phase is characterized by a minor surge in the (20-40)% range and is typically handled in a conventional fashion with response strategies such as conservation and substitution. [24] [25] The second phase is characterized by a moderate surge in the (80-100)% range and is typically handled in a contingency fashion with response strategies such as conservation, substitution, and adaptation. [24] [25] The third phase is characterized by a severe surge in the (180-200)% range and is typically handled in a crisis fashion with all response strategies such as conservation, substitution, adaptation, reuse and reallocation. [24] [25] The adaptation process can thus be understood in terms of the pandemic intensity at a given health system with conventional, contingency, and crisis phases. [24] [25] A second important framework for designing a surge response is the process of temporal triage that is based on patient flow. 24 In primary triage, the priorities for patient management are decided in the prehospital phase before the patient reaches the health system in question. In secondary triage, the priorities for patient management are typically decided on arrival to the hospital, most typically in the emergency department. [24] [25] In tertiary triage, the priorities for patient management continue in a definite clinical venue such as the intensive care unit and/or the operating room. [24] [25] The matrix for approaching the coronavirus crisis can thus be framed with 7 respect to intensity via the 3C model and with respect to patient flow via the 1 0 /2 0 /3 0 triage model.",

            "text": "The critical care workforce should be expanded and supported through all phases of the pandemic with processes such as meticulous infection control, high-quality communication, as well as an engaged and approachable leadership team. 1; 22 Furthermore, the critical care teams can be augmented with staff from allied departments (e.g. cardiothoracic surgery; trauma; emergency medicine) as well as selected staff from the anesthesiology department. These new recruits at all levels will require adapted training and education with appropriate simulation exercises, workshops, and short courses. 1; 22-25 The attrition of staff due to illness, vacation, and quarantine should be tracked and managed carefully and transparently in real-time. Acute shrinkage in the critical care workforce can also be minimized with detailed plans for infection 8 control, social distancing, vacation limits, and travel restrictions within a flexible framework that can be adapted and indexed to the intensity of the pandemic in real-time. 1; 22 The management of the critical care supplies remains essential to facilitate a smooth supply process for all these resources during the surge phases of the pandemic. [22] [23] There should be a transparent record-keeping system to track hardware movement throughout the health system in real-time. This hardware management process should be centralized to document reserves, to control waste, and to avoiding local hoarding. 1; 22 In the setting of an ECMO service line, this centralized registry should include ECMO hardware supplies. The integration of simulation into the clinical learning environment can greatly enhance best practices for appropriate utilization in the hardware line for all team members engaged in the response to COVID-19 throughout a given health system. 1; 22-25 Mechanical ventilators are an essential part of the hardware line for the critical care surge response to COVID-19 and as such may have to be triaged during the crisis phase of the pandemic. 26 The Center for Disease Control has recently issued guidance for the allocation of ventilators across a health care region. [27] [28] The first recommendation is to assess the ventilator demand based on data-tracking and subsequent modeling to predict the number of patients that will likely require ventilation. [27] [28] [29] The ventilator gap could then be calculated as the difference between this estimated ventilator demand and the number of ventilators immediately available, including locations outside the intensive care units such as the operating room environment (ventilator supply). [27] [28] The second recommendation is to assess the capacity for additional ventilators at a given institution after considering factors such as staffing, equipment capacity and physical space. The third recommendation is to consider equitable access across the health region, including factors such vulnerable populations, high-risk populations, and referral 9 centers. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The fourth consideration is to develop and apply an ethical framework to maximize patient salvage with transparent and consistent criteria, given the limited resources. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The concept of sharing a single ventilator for multiple patients has also been proposed as a solution to increase ventilator capacity during this coronavirus crisis. [30] [31] A device for sharing a ventilator in this fashion has recently received emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the United States. 32",
