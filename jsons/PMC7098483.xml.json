CT features at the early-stage of COVID-19 have not particularly studied yet, which is vital to the early identification of suspected cases. The purpose of this study was to explore the early-stage clinical and CT features of nucleic acid-positive COVID-19.",

Their clinical data included the onset symptoms and main laboratory findings (divided into 3 groups; A, decreased; B, normal; C, elevated). Observation parameters on CT included lesions distribution, size (maximum diameter in axial images), attenuation category (type I, pure ground-glass opacities- pGGOs; type II, GGOs with consolidation; type III, GGOs with interlobular septal thickening; type IV, consolidation), lesion-related signs (vessel expansion, air bronchogram), mediastinal lymphadenectasis (>1 cm in short-axis diameter) and pleural effusion. CT score was defined to quantify the pulmonary lesions in CT. The design formula was \u201csize (cm) * attenuation category weight\u201d. The attenuation category weight was \u201c1\u201d for type I, \u201c2\u201d for type II/III, and \u201c3\u201d for type IV, which was discussed by two experienced chest radiologists, especially for the infectious disease diagnosis.",

The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral (92.11%) and posterior part (71.71%, type I: 51.17%) of the lung. The size of type I was 1.37\u00b11.08 cm (range, 0.34\u20138.53 cm), significantly smaller than that of type II (2.12\u00b12.00 cm, 0.3\u201313.53 cm, p<0.001), but no statistically difference with type IV (1.52\u00b10.88 cm, 0.38\u20133.12 cm, p=0.2553). The size of type II was significantly smaller than that of type III (4.7\u00b12.58 cm, 1.36\u201311.90 cm, p<0.001), but no statistically difference with type IV (p=0.4632). The size of type III was also significantly larger than that of type IV (p<0.001). The CT score was 38.44\u00b134.56 (range, 0\u2013136.13).

The adjusted R2 was 0.509. Only CD4+ T cell (B=\u221225.738, p=0.018), CRP (B=20.565, p=0.044) and LDH (B=23.201, p=0.010) got statistically significance of the linear regression with CT score. 28.95% lesions were with vessel expansion, while 40.13% with air bronchogram. 6.82% patients had mediastinal lymphadenopathy, while 6.82% patients had pleural effusion (bilateral: 2/44; unilateral: 1/44). All patients obtained follow-up CT at least once. During our study period, we recorded all patients' first follow-up CT (interval of 2\u20137 days; median, 4 days). 81.82% patients showed lesions progression, while 13.64% patients showed lesion absorption.

Some experts suggested that COVID-19 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV [10]. Many patients' CD3+ T, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T cell counts also decreased which indicated COVID-19 could attack immunocyte and lead to the imbalanced immune regulation. The CD4+ T cell counts, as well as CRP and LDH got linear regression to the severity of pulmonary lesions on CT, which was not depicted before. Significantly, those indicators enrolled in the model were the first value and divided as the category variable, which might indicate the patients' onset pulmonary severity levels. Similar to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection [9], some patients presented elevated level of liver aminotransferase, which may indicate the potential liver injury [11].",
