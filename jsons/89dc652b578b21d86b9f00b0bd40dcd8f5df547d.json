The pathogenic agent is a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that infects pulmonary cells with great effectiveness. In this study we focus on the codon composition for the viral proteins synthesis and its relationship with the proteins synthesis of the host. Our analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 preferred codons have poor representation of G or C nucleotides in the third position, a characteristic which could conduct to an unbalance in the tRNAs pools of the infected cells with serious implications in host protein synthesis. By integrating this observation with proteomic data from infected cells, we observe a reduced translation rate of host proteins associated with highly expressed genes, and that they share the codon usage bias of the virus. The functional analysis of these genes suggests that this mechanism of epistasis contributes to understand some deleterious collateral effect as result of the viral replication. In this manner, our finding contribute to the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogeny and could be useful for the design of a vaccine based on the live attenuated strategy.",

This highly pathogenic virus has quickly become the latest threat to the modern human lifestyle. Since the end of 2019 up to the redaction of this paper, this virus has infected over 3 million people, leading to mild symptoms from fever, lung function reduction, to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and even death. Today there are over 215.000 death all over the world. However, we are still far from determining the final mortality figure. In the absence of vaccines or effective antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand how this virus appropriates the host translation apparatus and subverts the immune defences of infected cells. This can be the first step in the development of novel therapeutics.",

Thus, virus replication requires ribosomes, tRNA and translation factors from the cell host. On the other hand, codon usage bias is a feature subject to natural selection and affects the genomes from all domains of life. It is known that more frequently used codons are used for coding highly abundant proteins (30, 9, 35, 11) . Virus genomes have also preference in the codon usage, but in this case the bias is constrained by the host translational machinery (38) . The effects of codon composition of a transcript on its translation have been reported in literature (34, 13, 26, 39) , and is considered an important determinant of gene expression (41, 42, 46) . However, the codon usage of a gene also affects the translation of other genes (12) . In fact the virus replication demands not only ribosomes, but also a lot tRNA resource for the most demanded codons. Thus, the consumption of specific tRNAs for the virus replication could be an alternative to control host protein synthesis machinery, as well as generating deleterious collateral effects on the function of the host cells.",

By considering the codon usage of the virus ORFeome, we characterise a set of genes whose expression could be affected by the massive demand of the tRNA which implies the virus replication. We find that those host genes encoding proteins with similar codons to the virus ORFeome have lower translational rate. Extrapolating this finding to highly expressed genes in lung, we find a small set of genes that can be downregulated. These genes are involved in translation, immune systems, cell calcification, etc., and their roles on the SARS-CoV-2 cell pathogenesis should be the target of further studies.",

            "text": "Most of these proteins are highly expressed at 10h post infection (PI). This implies that the replication of SARS-CoV-2 would demand a higher supply for specific tRNAs than his ancestor. In turn, this could lead to an imbalance in the tRNA pool needed for the normal synthesis of the proteins of the host cell, altering its proteostasis. Of course, as tRNA pools depend on the cell types, the postulated imbalance could be a tissue-dependent feature. To check this hypothesis, we make use of the recently available data about the proteome profile and translational rate in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (4) . In this study CACO-2 cell line was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and mocked, the last one was used as control. From this proteome we select the coding sequences corresponding to the 100 most abundant proteins in the mock infected cells at 10h PI. Then, we compute the codon correlation (CCorr) between the codon usage of each one of these sequences and the codon usage of all coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2. Figure 2 depicts a raster plot of the translational rate of these genes from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells versus the corresponding CCorr (red dots). The black line is the adjusted linear model, which shows a significant and negative correlation between the translation rate and the codon composition of each sequence. This means that the translational rate of coding sequence in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are lower than in mock-infected cells. Although the correlation (\u03c1 = 0.26) with codon composition is not high, reflecting the fact that other factors could be regulating the translation rate, is significant at a of 0.05 (p-value= 0.024 < 0.05). This analysis suggests then that the codon composition of highly expressed host-genes is a determinant of its own translation rate, and that viral replication induces a particular case of epistasis which could affect host cell proteostasis. Consequently, we find it relevant to extrapolate this phenomenon to the cells that conform lung tissue, the main target of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this aim, we select the 100 most expressed genes in lung from the GTEx database, and compute the CCorr for each sequence. Figure 3A shows that the codon composition profile of the most expressed genes from both cells types are different, it is evident that the lung cells share fewer codons in common with the SARS-CoV-2 than the CACO-2 cells. Consequently, the tRNAs pool used for the virus could be a more scarce supply in lung cells than in the CACO-2 cells.",

In this sense, we used the Mann-Whitney U test for median differences of independent samples to analyse the difference in translational rate between these two groups of genes. This test identified significant differences between these groups (p-value=0.0007), as it can be seen in Fig. 3B .

Beyond its function in translation, EEF1A1 takes part in the innate immune system, by activating directly the transcription of IFN-gamma (25) . IFNgamma activates immune cells, such as macrophages and natural killer cells and stimulates the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II-dependent presentation of antigens to the immune system (37) . This process could be downregulated due to a decrease in the translation rate of EEF1A1. Furthermore, B2M, other gene in the list of decreased translational rate, encodes one of the proteins that conform MHC class I found on the cell surface of all nucleated cells (2) . Together with TXNIP, RPS3A and RPS27A, it is involved in the antigen processing and presentation. Moreover, this gene, along with S100A11, HSP90AB1 and also EEF1A1, regulates the exocytosis of granules containing inflammatory mediators in neutrophils (24) .In addition, our analysis shows a translation decrease in A2M, a plasmatic protein that inhibits a broad spectrum of proteases, including trypsin, thrombin and collagenase (6) . Finally, we highlight the presence in our analysis of the HSP90AB1, a known chaperone that facilitates the maturation of a wide range of proteins and its attenuation has been related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis (16, 43) .",

The first gene SAT1 catalyses the acetylation of polyamines (spermidine and spermine) and carries it out of the cell. The polyamine excess is a prominent source of oxidative stress which can increases inflammatory response (20) . Polyamines have also been connected with the immune system (32) . On the other hand, the MGP gene encodes the matrix gla protein which is also highly expressed in all vasculatures. Recent studies suggest that MGP downregulates the tissue calcification by sequestering bone morphogenetic proteins (44) . Mutations in this gene cause Keutel syndrome, which is characterised by peripheral pulmonary stenosis and abnormal cartilage calcification (27) .",

For example, NS1 protein plays a central role in the influenza infection by suppressing the host IFNs response. Further, the N protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus impairs the IFN transcription by acting over the TXK, which together with the EEF1A1 and PARP1 form the trimolecular complex that binds to the IFN-\u03b3 gene promoter (25, 21) .

Up to the present, no dedicated factor with analogue function have been identified in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, a recent report found a significant lack of IFN type I and III at the transcriptional level in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (3) . On the other hand, a marked upregulation of inflammatory mediators at the protein level (CXCL10, CCL2, IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b3) has been observed in patients with SARS-CoV, without a significant amount of specific antibody (5) . Several case of absence of protective immunity due to previous infection seem to indicate a similar landscape for COVID-19. Until now, the manner in which some patients fail to develop adaptive immunity is yet to be elucidated. As mentioned in the Results section, the decreased translate of B2M could be related with this last observation since is a crucial factor for the stable presentation of antigens derived from virus or tumours proteins; this antigens are recognised by cytotoxic T cells that eventually eliminate the target cell stimulating apoptosis to prevent systemic dissemination of the disease (19) .",

However, whether the codon composition of viral ORFome can affect the translation rate of host genes has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we have shown that the synthesis of the proteins associated with highly expressed genes, and with similar codon usage to the one of the virus, appears to be downregulated. Following this idea we determine which genes in lung could be affected by the viral replication.
