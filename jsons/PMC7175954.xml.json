However, as a consequence of anthropogenic alterations in land use, river regulation and water abstraction, primary producer communities and sources of organic carbon for invertebrate consumers have changed (Biggs 1996; Blanch et al. 1999; Blanch et al. 2000; Baattrup\u2010Pedersen et al. 2005). For example, the Darling, Murray, Napean, Hawkesbury and Swan Rivers in Australia have changed from clear water \u2013 macrophyte dominated ecosystems to turbid, plankton dominated systems (Harris 2001; Scheffer et al. 2001). Other lotic ecosystems, particularly the more ephemeral systems, either have a significantly reduced biodiversity (i.e. the loss of many aquatic and riparian plant species and their replacement by more terrestrial species) or a substantial microbenthos community, as a result of anthropogenic alterations (Sheldon & Walker 1997; Burns & Walker 2000a; Burns & Walker 2000b). These alterations in the primary producer communities will impact on the dynamics of organic carbon cycles (Robertson et al. 1999) and food web structure and function (Ward & Stanford 1983; Hicks 1997; Harris 1999a).",

            "text": "Stable isotopes can be used to trace the origin and movement of energy and nutrients from primary producers/autotrophs to consumers (Connolly et al. 2005). The stable isotope ratios of carbon (\u03b413C) and nitrogen (\u03b415N) differ among autotrophs (Fry 1984; Bouillon et al. 2002) and these ratios, the isotopic signatures, are taken on by the consumers and reflected in their tissues at whatever trophic level they occur (Fry & Sherr 1984; Wada et al. 1991; Boon & Bunn 1994; Peterson 1999). Routine analysis of \u03b413C and \u03b415N provide information on the carbon to nitrogen ratios of the source material. These ratios may be interpreted stoichiometrically and may provide additional information about the suitability of the food source, and the consequences of elemental imbalances between consumers and their food sources (Frost et al. 2005). The concept of ecological stoichiometry recognizes that freshwater primary invertebrate consumers have conservative C:N ratios of 4\u201310:1 (mean 6.3) (Elser et al. 2000a). In contrast, potential food sources have C:N ratios that range from <5 to >70 (mean 10.2:1) (Elser et al. 2000a). In general, terrestrial food sources have higher C:N (mean 36:1) ratios than their freshwater counterparts. Higher C:N ratios will result in increased consumption rates and reduced food assimilation efficiencies, which ultimately translates into reduced growth and survivorship by primary consumers (Tuchman et al. 2003).",

An example is the Mt Lofty Ranges in South Australia where many native plant species are in decline and agricultural practises have caused a loss of the riparian zone (Holmes & Iversen 1976; Kraehenbuehl 1996). Changes in hydrology have resulted in the loss of aquatic macrophytes (Holmes & Iversen 1976). A consequence of a shift away from aquatic and riparian to terrestrial plants is that it may force invertebrate consumers to rely upon food sources with a relatively high C:N ratio compared with their body tissue.",

The results are reported as ranges of minimum and maximum contributions (Benstead et al. 2006) and are not unique solutions but the best statistical estimates derived from the mixing model of Phillips and Gregg (2003). The second aim was to investigate how closely the C:N ratios in the principal food sources aligned with the C:N ratios in the shedders and to examine whether there was a mismatch between the two. Reaches with minimum anthropogenic influences were wooded or forested and it was hypothesized that in those reaches allochthonous carbon sources together with aquatic macrophytes would be the principal food source for local primary consumers (Vannote et al. 1980; Bunn 1993; Cummins et al. 1995; Hicks 1997). Primary consumers inhabiting reaches devoid of riparian vegetation and aquatic macrophytes (significant anthropogenic alterations) would feed on a nutritively inferior carbon source.",

This will inevitably lead to spatial variation in the distribution of both primary sources of organic carbon and their consumers. To reduce this effect of spatial variation in deciphering food webs (Boon & Bunn 1994) and to examine the effect of anthropogenic influences on carbon dynamics and food web structure and function within a lotic ecosystem, all study reaches were chosen along the Finniss River system (Fig. 1).",

Major land use in the catchment includes broad scale grazing (64% of total area), intensive grazing (12%), forestry and protected areas (21%), vines (2.6%), horticulture and floriculture (Savadamuthu 2003). In recent years, increasing development has put much pressure on the available water, through the increased use of farm dams and ground water extraction.

Each site was a 100 m riverine reach and three representative reaches of each category were selected. Those reaches classified as minimal (Sites 40, 18 and 22) were surrounded by extensive native forest/woodland, the understoreys were dominated by native species, with an abundance of riparian and aquatic species present in\u2010stream, and with no indications of agricultural development or grazing by livestock. The sites with modest development (Sites 48, 17 and 27) had a reduced canopy cover (between 30% and 60% relative to the minimal sites), had an altered understorey cover (between 30% and 60% of species were native compared with the minimal sites) and were subject to some grazing by livestock. The widespread sites (Sites 36, 44 and 30) were devoid of canopy cover, the understoreys was dominated by pasture grasses (>90%) and were mostly devoid of any riparian/aquatic in\u2010stream vegetation cover (<10%), and were subject to intensive grazing.

A more extensive study between 31 October and 2 November, 2005, sampled all nine sites (Fig. 1). To reduce the influence of macroinvertebrate driftsampling only occurred after flow had been low for at least 7 days prior to sampling. The protocol for the pilot study was to collect specimens of macroinvertebrate shredders and the three most dominant macrophytes species from each site (Table 1). This was used as an indication of the role aquatic macrophytes played in the nutrition of shredder communities. For the more extensive study, the protocol was to collect specimens of shredders and all potential primary sources, both terrestrial and aquatic. To reduce the effect of habitat type (e.g. riffles, pool and edge), only pool habitats (with still or slow flowing water) were sampled within each selected site. Three replicate pool habitats each with a surface area of approximately 10 m2 were sampled within each site and the samples collected were pooled for each site. Three replicate samples of each of the primary sources of organic carbon (plant species and course particulate organic matter, CPOM) were randomly collected from the same location as the macroinvertebrates sampled. Macroinvertebrates were collected using a kick\u2010net (250 \u03bcm mesh) and immediately stored in 70% ethanol (Jardine et al. 2003). Plant samples were refrigerated immediately and then frozen as soon as possible (same day) and stored for isotope analysis.",

This method examined all possible combinations of each primary source potential contribution (0\u2013100%) in small increments (here 1%) when the number of primary sources per site were either 6 or 7, and 2% when the number of primary sources were 8 (Phillips & Gregg 2003). Combinations that added to within 0.01\u2030 of the consumer signature were considered feasible solutions (Melville & Connolly 2003; Connolly et al. 2005). As recommended by Phillips and Gregg (2003), results are reported as the distribution of feasible solutions for each primary source. The median contribution and the 1 and 99 percentile range is given, rather than the full range, which is sensitive to small numbers of observations on the tails of the distribution (Phillips & Gregg 2003). All feasible source mixture modelling is presented for each vegetation group across each level of anthropogenic development (Minimal to Widespread), and individually for each site and its primary sources during the second sampling period. Interpretation of these potential contributions (1 (minima) and 99 (maxima) percentile range) deserves some discussion here. According to Benstead et al. (2006), low maxima are least ambiguous and therefore most useful; they indicate that the organic matter source can be rejected as important. Relatively high minima indicate that the source may be important, if all likely sources have been included in the analysis. Large ranges between minima and maxima are clearly not informative, unless the minima is relatively high, and small ranges represent relatively well constrained estimates of the source contribution (Benstead et al. 2006).",

Large variations in the C:N ratios of autotrophs occurs within and between ecosystems (Elser et al. 2000a). The C:N ratio found in the primary sources varied considerably among sites with the same level of development and between sites with differing levels of development. Reasons for this discrepancy have been attributed to differences in resorption efficiency, nutrient availability and plant homeostatic regulation (Aerts 1996; Gusewell 2004). However, regardless of the level of development across a broad range of food qualities and physiochemical environmental conditions (Cross et al. 2005), the primary macroinvertebrate consumers were relatively homeostatic in their C:N ratios and this is in accordance with other studies (Elser et al. 2000b; 2005, 2003; Frost et al. 2003).",

            "text": "The elemental composition of autotrophs is often out of balance with the nutritional demands of herbivorous animals (Elser et al. 2000a). Emergent aquatic macrophytes tend to be carbon\u2010rich owing to a requirement for a carbon\u2010based strengthening frame, whereas most herbivores and decomposers (animals, bacteria and fungi) found in aquatic systems have a much lower C:N ratio (Elser et al. 2000a), as was the case for the shredder communities in this study. This suggests that elemental imbalances between food resources and consumer requirements may be common in these systems (Cross et al. 2005). Many consumers selectively feed on high energy (high C) or high nutritive food resources or a specific combination thereof (Plath & Boersma 2001). Both Amphipoda and Trichoptera selectively fed on vegetation group 3 across sites with modest to minimum anthropogenic developments. This vegetation group contained the lowest C:N ratio (Fig. 2) and therefore the highest nutritional content. In degraded riverine reaches there are limited food resources available, hence vegetation group 1 (CPOM) formed the main dietary components of Amphipoda even though it had the highest C:N ratio. At site 36, vegetation group 6 (filamentous algae) was the main dietary component of Trichoptera owing to its availability and its low C:N ratio in comparison to the other primary sources available. The imbalanced consumer\u2010resource nutrient ratios in these degraded riverine reaches are likely to impose constraints on the growth and reproduction of their aquatic shredder communities with probable knock\u2010on effects to higher trophic levels (Plath & Boersma 2001; Frost & Elser 2002; Frost et al. 2002; 2003, 2002; Cross et al. 2003; Brookes et al. 2005; Tibbets & Molles 2005).",
