No RNA transcript is synthesized in a \u201cready\u2010to\u2010use\u201d fashion by a DNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase in the cell. All primary transcripts undergo some form of processing in their maturation. Messenger RNAs made by RNA polymerase II, for example, must be capped at their 5\u2032 end, spliced to remove introns, and cleaved/polyadenylated at their 3\u2032 ends to serve as effective mRNAs. Many transcripts also undergo RNA editing or base methylations to further fine tune their RNA sequence/base composition/structure. Furthermore, RNAs must be properly localized in the cell for effective gene expression. RNA degradation rates play a major role in regulating the levels of specific transcripts. Translation rates are also regulated. To add to this growing complexity, there is a large number of small and long non\u2010coding RNAs in the cell that undoubtedly also influence aspects of gene expression in a very significant way. Thus to truly understand how gene expression is regulated, one needs to fully consider all aspects of a transcript's post\u2010transcriptional fate.",

            "text": "Unlike most cellular pre\u2010mRNAs which contain one or more introns, most transcripts generated by RNA viruses possess no introns. Influenza viruses and Borna disease virus are among the rare classes of RNA viruses that generate pre\u2010mRNAs that undergo splicing (Fournier et al., 2014). RNA viruses that utilize splicing as a component of their strategy of gene expression all have a nuclear aspect to their life cycle as their transcripts must be present in this cellular compartment to usurp the cellular RNA splicing machinery (Chua, Schmid, Perez, Langlois, & Tenoever, 2013; Dubois, Terrier, & Rosa\u2010Calatrava, 2014; Tsai et al., 2013). The genome of influenza A virus is comprised of eight single\u2010stranded negative RNA segments that encode 10 main viral proteins and numerous other auxiliary proteins. The two smallest viral RNAs, M and NS, undergo splicing. The M segment can generate the unspliced M1 mRNA transcript and the spliced M2 mRNA transcript (Figure 1a). M1 encodes the M1 matrix protein and M2 an ion channel protein. Alternatively spliced transcripts of the M pre\u2010mRNA encode a small polypeptide of unknown function (Shih, Suen, Chen, & Chang, 1998), and for some viral strains alternative splicing of M generates variant M42 of the M2 ion channel (Wise et al., 2012). Likewise, the NS segment can generate the unspliced NS1 mRNA transcript and the spliced NS2 mRNA. These transcripts encode two multifunctional proteins. NS1 encodes the nonstructural NS1 protein, which acts (among other things) as an interferon antagonist, countering the cellular antiviral responses. NS2 encodes the NS2/NEP protein, which has dual roles both in viral genome replication and nuclear export of newly synthetized viral RNPs (Fournier et al., 2014). Alternative splicing of the NS RNA generates a transcript encoding a truncated version of NS1 termed NS3. This alternatively spliced transcript has been reported to exist for some viral strains (Selman, Dankar, Forbes, Jia, & Brown, 2012).",

Reovirus strain Type 1 Lang (T1L) has been shown to repress interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b2 signaling while Type 3 Dearing (T3D) does not (Zurney, Kobayashi, Holm, Dermody, & Sherry, 2009). The different influence of the two strains on IFN\u2010 \u03b2 signaling is determined by the M1 gene encoding the reovirus \u03bc2 protein (Irvin et al., 2012). The \u03bc2 protein from the T3D strain contains a serine at position 208 while the T1L strain contains a proline at this position. A minor capsid protein, \u03bc2 protein is highly expressed in infected cells and has RNA binding (Wise et al., 2012) and NTPase activities (Kim, Parker, Murray, & Nibert, 2004; Kobayashi, Ooms, Chappell, & Dermody, 2009). It also determines virus strain\u2010specific differences in the morphology of viral factories via its ability to bind and stabilize microtubules (Parker, Broering, Kim, Higgins, & Nibert, 2002). \u03bc2 localizes mainly to viral factories upon infection (Broering, Parker, Joyce, Kim, & Nibert, 2002), but it can also be observed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (Mbisa, Becker, Zou, Dermody, & Brown, 2000). Recently it has been shown that \u03bc2 from T1L and reovirus recombinants encoding the T1L \u03bc2 amino acid polymorphism form a complex with the pre\u2010mRNA splicing factor SRSF2 in nuclear speckles, interchromatin domains that are highly enriched in splicing factors (Figure 1b) (Rivera\u2010Serrano, Fritch, Scholl, & Sherry, 2017). T1L thus has demonstrated an ability to alter splicing of cellular transcripts. Depletion of SRSF2 also leads to enhanced reovirus replication and cytopathic effects, indicating that T1L \u03bc2 influences splicing of cellular mRNAs in a manner benefitting the virus. This suggests that antagonism of the splicing factor SRSF2 by a cytoplasmic RNA virus has global consequences within the cell.",

Alphaviruses, for example, sequester the cellular HuR protein and relocalize it the cytoplasm during infection (Barnhart, Moon, Emch, Wilusz, & Wilusz, 2013; Sokoloski et al., 2010). This results in a disruption of alternative splicing patterns that are normally regulated by the HuR protein (Sokoloski et al., 2010). Thus the impact of RNA viruses on cellular RNA splicing patterns is an interesting and likely highly fruitful area for future study.",

            "text": "Generally speaking, RNA viruses add a poly(A) tail to their transcripts using their own encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by one of two mechanisms. As seen in picornaviruses, viral poly(A) tails can be synthesized using a poly(U) stretch on the 5\u2019end of the template strand (Figure 2a) (Kempf & Barton, 2015; Steil, Kempf, & Barton, 2010). Long poly(U) stretches can also be found at the ends of the template for the synthesis of plus strands in alphaviruses and coronaviruses as well. Alternatively, poly(A) tails can be made by the viral RdRp stuttering over a short U tract (Figure 2b). Good examples of this stuttering mechanism can be seen throughout the negative sense RNA viruses, including rhabdoviruses (Barr, Whelan, & Wertz, 2002), filoviruses (Volchkova, Vorac, Repiquet\u2010Paire, Lawrence, & Volchkov, 2015), paramyxoviruses (Hausmann, Garcin, Delenda, & Kolakofsky, 1999), and orthomyxoviruses (Poon, Pritlove, Fodor, & Brownlee, 1999). Interestingly, there have been several reports that indicate the polyadenylation event in RNA viruses may be regulated. The usage of the RNA editing site in the GP gene of Ebola viruses appears to be regulated by alternative polyadenylation (Volchkova et al., 2015). Mutational analyses suggest that there is a functional link between 5\u2032 capping and 3\u2032 polyadenylation by the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) L protein (Li, Rahmeh, Brusic, & Whelan, 2009). There is also variation in the size of poly(A) tails that could have biological relevance. Among the picornaviruses, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) transcripts have a relatively short ~20 base poly(A) tail as opposed to polioviruses/rhinoviruses which have longer (~60 base) poly(A) tails (Kempf & Barton, 2015). Coronavirus poly(A) tails have also been demonstrated to show small variations in length throughout infection (Wu, Ke, Liao, & Chang, 2013). These differences in the size of the poly(A) tail may reflect differences in viral mRNA translatability or relative stability. Finally, several RNA viruses have been shown to be able to use cellular poly(A) polymerase activities to repair/generate poly(A) tails (Liu et al., 2008).",

            "text": "RNA viruses that do not generate polyadenylated transcripts still have to ensure that their RNAs are protected from exonucleolytic digestion and function effectively in translation. Host cell histone mRNAs are naturally nonpolyadenylated, thus this is clearly achievable (Romeo & Sch\u00fcmperli, 2016). RNA viruses with nonpolyadenylated 3\u2032 ends (e.g., flaviviruses, bunyaviruses, etc.) all contain large 3\u2032 terminal structures that likely serve as effective structural impediments to 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exonucleases (Figure 2c) (Ibrahim, Wilusz, & Wilusz, 2008). Thus these terminal structures make a significant contribution to viral RNA stability\u2014but how do they also compensate for the lack of poly(A) binding protein on their 3\u2032 ends? In order to mimic the role of the poly(A) tail in translation initiation, the reovirus NSP3 protein has a higher affinity for eIFG4 than cellular PABP2 (Gratia et al., 2015). Transcripts from another family of nonpolyadenylated RNA virus, flaviviruses, contain 3\u2019 UTR elements that coordinate with the 5\u2032 sequences to mediate efficient translation as well as bind PABP2 in a poly(A)\u2010independent fashion (Chiu, Kinney, & Dreher, 2005; Polacek, Friebe, & Harries, 2009).",

Influenza virus, for example, inhibits pre\u2010mRNA cleavage and uses its NS1 protein to target the cellular PABP2 factor (Chen, Li, & Krug, 1999; Shimizu, Iguchi, Gomyou, & Ono, 1998). Alphavirus RNAs use a high affinity binding site in their 3\u2019 UTR to bind and cause the relocalization of the predominantly nuclear HuR protein (Barnhart et al., 2013; Dickson et al., 2012). This results in the dysregulation of polyadenylation at sites normally regulated by HuR. Finally, it has been recently demonstrated that VSV infection causes dramatic changes in alternative polyadenylation site usage on cellular mRNAs (Jia et al., 2017). This may have implications regarding cellular innate immune responses to the virus.",

            "text": "While most capping enzymes encoded by RNA viruses follow the overall enzymatic blueprint set out by the cellular capping machinery, there is one interesting nuance in some viral enzymes in terms of the source of the phosphates in the final 7mGpppN cap structure. VSV encodes for an enzymatic domain in the multifunctional L protein known as GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase) which is responsible for generating a fully methylated cap on viral mRNA. In short, PRNTase forms a covalent bond with the viral mRNA via a monophosphate (p) on the 5\u2032 end (as opposed to a ppN 5\u2032 end like the cellular enzyme). This PRNTase\u2010pRNA intermediate is transferred to GDP (rather than GMP like cellular transcripts). The GDP for capping is generated by the L proteins GTPase activity on GTP. The resulting GpppRNA is further modified, becoming first an m7G cap 0, followed by 2\u2019\u2010O methylation of the first base (cap 1). Through the use of GDP analogues, the PRNTase domain was shown to recognize the C2\u2010amino group and either the 2\u2032 or 3\u2032 hydroxyl group of GDP to facilitate this novel mechanism of cap formation (Li, Wang, & Whelan, 2006; Ogino & Ogino, 2017; Ogino, Yadav, & Banerjee, 2010).",

One example of this is with the flavivirus NS5 capping enzyme (Bullard et al., 2015; El Sahili & Lescar, 2017; Han & Lee, 2017). Small molecule inhibitors targeting multiple areas of the NS5 methyltransferase (MTase), including the SAM/SAH binding pocket, cap binding pocket and allosteric regulatory domains have been described [(Benmansour et al., 2017; Brecher et al., 2015; Coutard et al., 2014; Idrus, Tambunan, & Zubaidi, 2012; Lim et al., 2011; Milani et al., 2009); reviewed in (Decroly & Canard, 2017)]. Inhibition of the ZIKV MTase has also been proposed as an antiviral strategy for that emerging pathogen (Coutard et al., 2017). Interestingly, inhibiting viral MTases has shown favorable results in attenuating multiple viruses that have the potential to be used as vaccines (Li et al., 2013; Zhang, Wei, Zhang, Cai, & Niewiesk, 2014).",

The virus encodes for a protein(s) that has an endonuclease domain, such as the L protein of Bunyaviridae or the heterotrimer of PA, PB1, and PB2 of influenza virus (with the endonuclease activity in the PA subunit). This viral endoribonuclease cuts close to the 5\u2032 cap of host RNA transcripts, most commonly occurring ~15 nucleotides downstream of the cap, but the cut site can vary by 10 to 20 nucleotides. This capped RNA fragment then acts as a primer for transcription (Cheng & Mir, 2012; Dias et al., 2009; Reguera, Weber, & Cusack, 2010).",

While the presence of a 5\u2032 cap effectively masks an RNA from recognition as foreign, viral capping may not be 100% efficient and viral transcripts often have structured ends which can be detected by the cellular nucleic acid surveillance machinery. One of the best characterized of these pathways involves RIG\u2010I, a protein which uses its C terminal domain to recognize viral RNA via either the presence of 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate on nascent transcripts or blunt\u2010ended dsRNA (Domain et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). Upon recognition of viral 5\u2032 ends with \u201cnoncellular\u201d structural configurations, RIG\u2010I becomes activated via a conformational change and signals the cell to begin interferon production. A good example of how the terminal structural features of viral RNAs can influence RIG\u2010I can be found in influenza viruses where the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of individual transcripts form a partial duplex (known as a panhandle) with each other. RIG\u2010I has a very high affinity for this structural feature and thus the panhandle effectively stimulates interferon production even though influenza virus does not have a 5\u2019\u2010PPP attached to the blunt\u2010ended dsRNA (Lee, Kim, et al., 2016).",

However, recent research has illustrated that this cap 0 structure alone does not prevent recognition by the cellular innate immune system. Surprisingly, RNAs with a cap 0 structure have a similar ability to activate RIG\u2010I as does an RNA containing a 5\u2032 triphosphate. However, RNAs that contain a cap 1 structure, one in which the first base of the transcript also contains a 2\u2019\u2010O ribose methylation, do not activate RIG\u2010I (Devarkar et al., 2016). The presence or absence of this 2\u2019\u2010O\u2010methylation cap 1 on transcripts is also monitored by the MDA5 protein which also triggers an interferon response\u2014primarily mediated by IFIT proteins, when this RNA modification is missing (Daffis et al., 2010; Lee, Kim, et al., 2016; Schlee et al., 2009; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011).

To avoid detection by this cellular surveillance mechanisms, viruses encode specific 2\u2019\u2010O\u2010methyltransferases (MTases) that are conserved in virus families, such as flaviviruses and recently roniviruses (Egloff, Benarroch, Selisko, Romette, & Canard, 2002; Zeng et al., 2016). Further research into the structural features of these MTases may reveal characteristics about the enzyme domains allowing for novel antiviral therapies that can target multiple viruses in a single family (Coutard et al., 2017).",

Knock down of m6A reader proteins, the YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF), increased viral replication late in infection. The YTHDF proteins were also shown to have competitive, antagonistic effects against the HCV core protein, which is responsible for viral packaging (Gokhale et al., 2016). Similar antiviral effects of m6A modification on viral RNAs were recently duplicated in another member of the Flaviviridae, Zika virus (ZIKV) (Lichinchi et al., 2016).

Mapping of m6A modification sites across HCV and ZIKV genomes showed highly conserved targeted sequences (Gokhale et al., 2016; Lichinchi et al., 2016). Given the capability of RNA viruses to evolve quickly under selective pressures, it seems unusual that they would maintain these m6A methylation targets if the modification solely led to antiviral effects. RNA viruses may maintain these regions to prevent activation of the immune system via toll\u2010like receptors and RIG\u2010I (Durbin, Wang, Marcotrigiano, & Gehrke, 2016; Karik\u00f3, Buckstein, Ni, & Weissman, 2005). It should also be noted that host cells appear to be able to sense and react to viral infection by changing m6A methylation status of cellular transcripts (Lichinchi et al., 2016). In the case of HCV, m6A methylations may actually increase viral fitness by slowing replication and facilitating the characteristic slow, persistent infection strategy favored by the virus (Gokhale et al., 2016). Finally, the patterns of m6A vary between different ZIKV lineages (Lichinchi et al., 2016). As different lineages provide varying levels of pathogenicity (Weaver et al., 2016), regulation of m6A could theoretically be contributing to these differences. Clearly, further research into the role of m6A in cellular and viral gene regulation is needed to define this interesting new aspect of host\u2010virus RNA interplay.",

Mutational patterns in viral genomes do not occur randomly, rather certain nucleotide mutations always occur more frequently that others, a phenomenon known as directional mutational pressure. The source of such unequal viral mutation rates is largely due to error\u2010prone polymerases. RNA editing can be simply defined as the addition or substitution of RNA bases that were not originally encoded by the genome. RNA editing in paramyxoviruses, for example, occurs co\u2010transcriptionally when the RNA\u2010dependent\u2010RNA polymerase (RdRp) interacts with a cis\u2010acting sequence element (3\u2019\u2010UAAUUUUUUCCC) in the genome that causes a stuttering of the polymerase (Figure 3a). This \u201cstuttering\u201d mechanism is responsible for editing the RNA via the addition of up to 6 G's at a single RNA editing site (Iseni et al., 2002). Interestingly, RNA editing could also be done via cellular enzymes in a completely post\u2010transcriptional process.",

Humans possess three major ADAR isoforms: ADAR1\u2010p150, ADAR1\u2010p110, and ADAR2. ADAR enzymes facilitate adenosine deamination to inosine, which is biologically relevant since inosine behaves like guanosine and can base\u2010pair with cysteine. During viral replication, the cysteine\u2010inosine base\u2010pairing will lead to guanosine being incorporated in place of inosine, ultimately leading to adenosine to guanosine transition mutations. The expression level of ADAR often increases as the cell detects increasing levels of foreign RNA. Interestingly, several viruses of the family Flaviviridae, including Hepatitis C virus, Bovine viral diarrhea virus, and Dengue virus, can stimulate ADAR expression, while many other virus families do not (Khrustalev, Khrustaleva, Sharma, & Giri, 2017). The consequence of ADAR editing of viral RNA is an increase in A to G transition rates (Liu et al., 2015). Studies on human metapneumovirus suggest that high levels of viral RNA editing may lead to the production of increased levels of defective interfering particles (van den Hoogen et al., 2014). The increased proportion of G's that results from ADAR editing might also have a positive effect on virus biology, enabling, for example, viral RNAs to form stronger or novel secondary structures given the higher stability of G\u2010C base pairing. Finally, RNA editing strategies like ADAR enzymes do not act uniformly along the length of viral RNA genome, thus directional mutational pressure and subsequently genomic mutational rates are not constant. An emerging hypothesis is that stalling of either the viral RdRp or cellular ribosomes on viral RNAs is associated with mutational pressure, perhaps by enabling RNA editing enzymes like ADAR to act on viral RNAs (Khrustalev et al., 2017).",

As outlined in Figure 4, the HCV IRES recruits an intermediate of the PIC that includes eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3 and forms in the absence of the ternary complex (TC). Binding to the IRES displaces eIF1 from the PIC and leads to one of two pathways to initiate translation depending on eIF2 availability in the cell. If eIF2 is in an active state, the TC is transferred to the IRES\u2010PIC complex, causing the IRES to undergo a conformational change. eIF2 would then hydrolyze GTP and leave, followed by binding of eIF5B to the complex. In an eIF2 inactive state, it is proposed that Met\u2010tRNAi\nMet can bind either directly without the need of a delivery factor and then is stabilized in the complex by eIF1A and eIF5B, or is delivered to the complex by either eIF1A or eIF5B. After Met\u2010tRNAi\nMet binding occurs in either of the two pathways, eIF1A and eIF5B proceed to then assist in the final codon\u2010anti\u2010codon verification and ribosomal subunit joining steps (Jaafar et al., 2016).",

Norovirus\u2010encoded protease targets several translation factors for decay, thus tipping the balance of translation initiation to favor viral mRNAs (Emmott, Sorgeloos, Caddy, & Heesom, 2017).

SG are membrane\u2010less aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes that form in the cytoplasm (Protter & Parker, 2016). To maintain the highest fidelity of viral translation, viruses have developed methods to interfere with this pathway. Some viruses, such as Ebola virus, have encoded proteins (VP35) to interfere and inhibit the function of G3BP1, a host protein that helps drive SG formation (Le Sage et al., 2017). Other viruses, such as Semliki Forest virus, sequester G3BP1 via nsP3 to its replication complex, preventing SG formation and enhancing viral replication (Panas et al., 2012). Additional viruses, such as flaviviruses, have been shown to modulate the translational landscape of the cell and prevent SG formation even though the exact mechanism has yet to be revealed (Haneke, Lohmann, Bartenschlager, & Fackler, 2017). The commonality of SG disruption in RNA virus infections, as well as the plethora of mechanisms through which SG formation is modulated, indicate its strategic importance for maintaining efficient viral replication and translation. Interestingly, not all RNA viruses target SGs for disruption. Rabies virus does not have mechanisms to modulate SG assembly and possibly uses them to maintain a healthy equilibrium of mRNA/translation for viral replication (Blondel, Nikolic, & Civas, 2016).",

A unique feature of all flaviviruses studied thus far is the formation of small subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) representing the 3\u2019 UTR of the viral genomic RNA by stalling of the cytoplasmic 5\u2032\u20103\u2032 exoribonuclease XRN1 (Pijlman et al., 2008).

This duality of effects of viral infections on P bodies can make elucidating their overall impact on virus biology difficult. P body formation is significantly affected in HCV infection, however the impact of P bodies on HCV replication efficiency is not clear (P\u00e9rez\u2010Vilar\u00f3, Scheller, Saludes, & D\u00edez, 2012).

The ability of the RNA interference pathway, including the generation of small interfering (si)RNAs and microRNAs, to silence viral RNA is a major part of antiviral innate defense mechanisms in plants and insects (Blair & Olson, 2015; Szittya & Burgy\u00e1n, 2013). The relevance of RNAi to antiviral responses in mammals is unclear (Cullen, Cherry, & tenOever, 2013; Li et al., 2016).

Semliki Forest virus appears to produce a viral RNA decoy to aid in evading the RNAi response (Siu et al., 2011). Viral proteins are also generated that interfere with the RNAi machinery. The NS4B and NS3 proteins of dengue virus interfere with RNAi pathways in insect cells (Kakumani et al., 2013; Kakumani et al., 2015). Several plant and animal viruses generate an RNAse III\u2010like enzyme that inhibits both the siRNA and miRNA pathways (Weinheimer et al., 2015). The NS1 protein of influenza virus can suppress the cellular RNAi machinery (Li, Basavappa, et al., 2016). Additionally, Ebola virus proteins VP30 and VP35 interfere with RNAi pathways (Fabozzi, Nabel, Dolan, & Sullivan, 2011; Pleet, DeMarino, Lepene, Aman, & Kashanchi, 2017). Clearly the interaction of RNA viruses with the cellular RNAi pathways represents an excellent example of the molecular arms race that has evolved between host and pathogen.",

Changes in the expression of cellular lncRNAs, for example, have been associated with flavivirus infections. DENV infection of mosquitoes causes an increase in cellular lncRNA production, some of which are associated with suppression of viral replication (Etebari, Asad, Zhang, & Asgari, 2016). Interestingly, RNA viruses can also manipulate the expression of cellular lncRNAs to favor their replication. For example, HCV infections induce production of eosinophil granule ontogeny transcript (EGOT) and other cellular lncRNAs that function as negative regulators of the interferon response (Carnero et al., 2016; Nishitsuji et al., 2016). In addition, influenza A virus can also induce the host VIN lncRNA that enhances viral replication (Winterling et al., 2014). Infection of mice with a variety of RNA viruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus, rabies virus and SARS\u2010CoV also results in induction of lncRNA, although the impact of these lncRNA on the viral infection remains unexplored (Peng et al., 2010). Clearly the interface of RNA viruses with cellular lncRNAs is a fertile area for future research.",

To date, the best example of miRNA sponging in RNA virus biology is associated with HCV where an interaction with cellular miR\u2010122 is essential for genome stability (Figure 7a) (Wilson & Huys, 2013). However, the sequestration of miR\u2010122 by the large number of HCV plus stranded RNAs has impact on the expression of cellular genes that are normally regulated by miR\u2010122. In some cases, these alterations in gene expression can promote viral replication. An up\u2010regulation of STAT3 in HCV infection, for example, represses an interferon (IFN) type I response (Xiong et al., 2015). The global effects of de\u2010repression of miR\u2010122 target genes in HCV have been documented via high\u2010throughput sequencing and cross\u2010linking immunoprecipitation (HITS\u2010CLIP) procedures (Luna et al., 2015). Other viruses besides HCV also disrupt cellular miRNA regulatory pathways. The sequestration of miR\u201017 by the 3\u2019 UTR of numerous pestivirus RNAs induced a global de\u2010repression of miR\u201017 gene targets (Figure 7a) (Scheel et al., 2016). It will be interesting to examine the capacity of other viral genomic RNAs to act as sponges for select cellular miRNAs or other transcripts.",

ZIKV sfRNA was also shown to interfere with RIG\u2010I mediated type I interferon responses, perhaps through a similar mechanism (Donald et al., 2016).

The 3\u2019 UTR region of Sindbis virus (SINV) contains a U\u2010rich region that interacts with the cellular protein HuR with high affinity (Barnhart et al., 2013). The binding of HuR protein by viral RNA leads to the stabilization of SINV RNAs by preventing deadenylation and decay (Garneau et al., 2008; Sokoloski et al., 2010). The sequestration or sponging of large amounts of HuR protein by alphavirus 3\u2019 UTRs causes the protein to relocalize from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells (Sokoloski et al., 2010). Besides adding stability to the viral RNA, sponging of HuR leads to disruption of post\u2010transcription regulation of host genes via destabilization of transcripts and dysregulation of splicing and polyadenylation (Barnhart et al., 2013; Dickson et al., 2012).

By impacting fundamental aspects of gene expression through altered post\u2010transcriptional pathways, invading RNA viruses significantly decrease the ability of the cell to alter its gene expression to respond to the pathogen. RNA viruses can target a wide range of aspects of post\u2010transcriptional including nuclear pre\u2010mRNA processing, modulation of cellular capping or subcellular localization of cellular mRNAs, and/or usurping translation and mRNA decay to favor virus gene expression. Cellular efforts to disfavor the use of these post\u2010transcriptional pathways by viruses\u2014many of which undoubtedly are yet to be discovered\u2014are part of the innate defense mechanism of the cell to infection.",
