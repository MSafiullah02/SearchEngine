Minimizing social interactions and travel reduces the rate at which the infection spreads, and \"flattens the curve\" such that the medical system can better treat infected individuals. However, it remains unclear how the public will respond to these policies. This paper presents the Twitter Social Mobility Index, a measure of social distancing and travel derived from Twitter data. We use public geolocated Twitter data to measure how much a user travels in a given week. We find a large reduction in travel in the United States after the implementation of social distancing policies, with larger reductions in states that were early adopters and smaller changes in states without policies.",

Without an available vaccine to reduce transmission of the virus, public health and elected officials have called on the public to practice social distancing. Social distancing is a set of practices in which individuals maintain a physical distance so as to reduce the number of physical contacts they encounter (Maharaj and Kleczkowski, 2012; Kelso et al., 2009 ). These practices include maintaining a distance of at least six feet and avoiding large gatherings (Glass et al., 2006) . At the time of this writing, in the United States nearly every state has implemented state-wide \"stay-at-home\" orders to enforce social distancing practices (Zeleny, 2020) .",

Understanding actual reductions in travel and social contacts is critical to measuring the effectiveness of the policy. These policies may remain in effect for an extended period of time. Thus, the public may begin to relax their practices, making additional policies necessary. Additionally, epidemiologists already model the impact of social distancing policies on the course of an outbreak (Prem et al., 2020; Fenichel et al., 2011; Caley et al., 2008) . These models may be more effective when incorporating actual measures of social distancing, rather than assuming official policies are implemented in practice.",

Polling is relatively expensive, making it a poor choice for ongoing population surveillance practices and providing data on specific geographic locales, i.e. US States and major cities (Dredze et al., 2016a) .

In this vein, several efforts have emerged over the past few weeks to track social distancing practices using these data sources. Google has released \"COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports\" which use Google data to \"chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential\" (Google, 2020). The Unacast \"Social Distancing Scoreboard\" uses data collected from 127 million monthly active users to measure the implementation of social distancing practices (Unacast, 2020) . Researchers at the Institute for Disease Modeling have used data from Facebook's \"Data for Good\" program to model the decline in mobility in the Greater Seattle area and its effect on the spread of COVID-19 (Burstein et al., 2020) . Using cell phone data, the New York Times completed an analysis that showed that stay-at-home orders dramatically reduced travel, but that states that have waited to enact such orders have continued to travel widely (Glanz et al., 2020) .

We compute a metric based on the standard deviation of a user's geolocated tweets each week, and aggregate these data over an entire population to produce a metric for the United States as a whole, for individual states and for some US cities. We find that, taking the US as a whole, there has been a dramatic drop in travel in recent weeks, with travel between March 16 and March 29, 2020 showing the lowest amount of travel since January 1, 2019, the start of our dataset. Additionally, we find that travel reductions are not uniform across the United States, but vary from state to state. A key advantage of our approach is that, unlike other travel and social distancing analyses referenced above, we rely on entirely public data, enabling others to replicate our findings and explore different aspects of these data. Additionally, since Twitter contains user generated content in addition to location information, future analyses can correlate attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors with changes in social mobility.",

            "text": "A few observations. The overall drop in mobility across the United States was large: 48.77%. Second, every US state and territory saw a drop in mobility, ranging from 21.54% to 63.13% travel compared to numbers before March 16, 2020. However, the variance by state was high. States that were early adopters of social distancing practices are ranked highly on the reduction in travel: e.g. Washington (3) and Maryland (5). In contrast, the eight states that do not currently have state wide orders (Zeleny, 2020) rank poorly: Arkansas (37), Iowa (50), Nebraska (29), North Dakota (13), South Carolina (34), South Dakota (39), Oklahoma (52), Utah (17), Wyoming (53). We measured two cities: New York City (51.16%) and Washington, DC (63.13%). The fact that Washington, DC, ranks first in Table 1 is consistent with the result in Unacast (2020), where DC has the highest grade (A-) as of date March 29, 2020. More work is needed to understand how to compare US states with cities. Figure 1 shows the weekly social mobility index for the United States for the entire time period of our dataset. The figure reflects a massive drop in mobility starting in March, with the two most recent weeks the lowest on record in our dataset. Finally, Figure 2 shows a box-plot of the mobility variance across all user in a given time period. The distribution is long-tailed and with a lot zeros, so we take the log of 1 plus each mobility index. While mobility is reduced in general, some users are still showing a lot of movement, suggesting that social distancing is not being uniformly practiced. These results clearly demonstrate that our metric can track drops in travel, suggesting that it can be used as part of ongoing pandemic response planning.",
