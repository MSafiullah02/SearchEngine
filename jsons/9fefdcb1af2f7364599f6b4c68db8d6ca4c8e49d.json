In etiologic studies of respiratory illnesses that have included influenza C testing, it usually accounts for a low proportion of acute respiratory pathogens identified. For example, a Canadian study 1 found 2.32% of respiratory samples tested from children identified influenza C, while a study in Japan spanning 18 years 2 (1996-2013) found influenza C in 0.43%-1.73% of samples from children; this result was similar to a Spanish study that reported influenza C in 0.7% of children's samples. 3 Low rates were reported in a retrospective study Scottish study that screened 3300 respiratory samples collected from children and adults during the period from August 2006 to June 2008 with only six positive influenza C-positive samples (0.2%) identified (with 4/6 from children \u22642 year) compared to 3.2% influenza A detections and 0.9% influenza B detections. 4 Higher rates of influenza C infection have been reported in a Nigerian study, where 4.8% of the respiratory samples from children were positive for influenza C 5 and Finnish study among young adult male military recruits, 6 in which influenza C was identified in 4.2% of all samples. Influenza C can also be identified in a significant proportion of children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections, as reported by Shimizu et al. 7 2015, who found approximately 10% of children had influenza C present in samples collected from four Japanese hospitals during 2009-2010.

The WAIVE study collected nasopharyngeal aspirates from children presenting to the Princess Margaret Children's Hospital emergency department during the influenza season (usually June/July-October), whereas SPNWA collected nose and throat swabs from patients presenting to GP clinics with ILI year-round. Testing for various respiratory pathogens varied between 2002 and 2014 as new tests were developed, but in general, samples were tested for influenza A, B, and C, influenza subtypes, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, and parainfluenza types 1-3 by PCR. WAIVE testing also included additional PCR tests for parainfluenza type 4, Bordetella pertussis, human bocavirus, coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63, enteroviruses (including rhinovirus) and human adenoviruses. From 2012 onwards, samples from SPN(WA) were no longer tested for influenza C due to the low detection rates. Further influenza C-positive respiratory samples were obtained from VIDRL, Melbourne, Victoria, during the period 2011-2014 when samples were tested for the presence of a panel of respiratory viruses by real-time PCR.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": ".

In our study, some clinical samples that initially had influenza A and C detected by real-time PCR, only yielded influenza A virus isolates even though the isolation was performed at 33\u00b0C (optimal for influenza C) instead of the usual 35\u00b0C (optimal for human influenza A).The HE protein of influenza C plays a unique role in the influenza C life cycle being responsible for the receptor binding, the receptor destroying enzyme action, and the membrane fusion activities of the virus.16 A phylogenetic analysis of the HE genes of the Australian influenza C sequences showed that of the six reference groups17 , the Australian viruses only fell into two of these groups with the majority grouping into the C/Sao Paulo/378/82 clade and a minority of viruses grouping with C/Kanagawa/1/76 clade. Viruses from both Perth and Victoria were found in both of these clades with the viruses from each state often occurring within the same branch and closely grouping according to the year of their collection. The finding of viruses collected in 2008 closely aligning with viruses from 2014 demonstrates the low rate of mutation of the HE gene in influenza C compared with the HA and NA of influenza A and B. A recent report by Odagiri et al. 8 2015 on influenza C viruses collected in Japan and the Philippines from 2008 to 2013 found that all 19 influenza C viruses sequenced, belonged to the C/Sao Paulo/378/82-lineage. Interestingly, a study of circulating influenza C viruses in 2014 in Yamagata, Japan 17 , found both C/Kanegawa/1/76-lineage and C/Sao Paulo/378/82-lineage influenza C viruses in circulation with the C/Kanegawa/1/76-lineage predominating most recently.
