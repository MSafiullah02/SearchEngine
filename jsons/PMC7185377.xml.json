            "text": "Influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) cause acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children, being a leading cause of hospitalization [1], [2], [3]. Identification of both viruses is important for disease management, as the presence of these infections may require specific treatment (i.e. oseltamivir) and hospital containment measures. The current gold standard for detection of these viruses is real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) [4]. This is however not performed in all hospitals, as it requires a molecular diagnostic laboratory with specialized personnel and equipment. Instead, rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) are used as these assays are easier and cheaper to perform and less time-consuming [5], [6], [7]. The performance of these tests depends on factors like time between disease onset and sampling, quality and type of specimen and epidemiological parameters [8]. Diagnostic value and clinical usefulness of RADTs for influenza diagnosis vary greatly [5], [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12]. This prompted us to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the routinely used RADTs (manufactured by Alere BinaxNOW\u00ae) for these two viruses as used in our tertiary care paediatric hospital.",

The extractions were internally controlled by addition of a known concentration of phocine distemper virus (PDV) and phocine herpes virus (PHV). Uni-plex RT-PCR was used to detect RSV-A, RSV-B, human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 (PIV-3), adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). Duplex reactions were performed combining influenza A virus and PDV, influenza B virus and human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (HCoVOC43), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and PIV-2, HCoV229E and PIV-4, and HCoVNL63 and PIV-1. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) of <40 was defined positive for any virus. RT-PCRs were developed in-house for influenza viruses and RSV-A and validated [13]. RSV-B primers and probes were used as reported by Dewhurst-Maridor et al. [14].",

However, RADTs are valuable as a point-of-care test for their ease of use, fast results and laboratory independence [8]. These advantages, and especially the high specificity are important for their use as surveillance tools for influenza outbreaks as recommended by the World Health Organization [8]. Indeed for surveillance purpose a high specificity is of importance, which we found to be the case in our study. However, for clinical management this is not sufficient. In theory, the decision to start antiviral therapy and to refrain from unnecessary further diagnostic testing and antibiotic use may be based on RADT [16], [17], [18]. In addition, rapid test results may result in more effective isolation and containment measures [6]. For this purpose assay sensitivity is of utmost importance. Therefore, we conclude that the relatively low sensitivity of the BNI in our tertiary care centre is worrisome. Of note, BNR test performance proved to be better compared to the BNI, although false-negative cases were detected. Based on our results we stopped using BNI and will use rapid PCR-based tests for detection of influenza virus and RSV.",

Given the relatively low sensitivity and PPV of the BNI we strongly advocate a restricted use of BNI or similar rapid influenza antigen detection assays in a tertiary paediatric care setting.
