Entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S, which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions 1 . S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a mouse coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins 2,3 , implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.",

S determines host range, cell tropism and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection 1 . S is a class I viral fusion protein synthesized as a single chain precursor of about 1,300 amino acids that trimerizes upon folding. It is composed of an amino-terminal S 1 subunit, containing the receptor-binding domain, and a carboxy-terminal S 2 subunit, driving membrane fusion. Cleavage by furin-like host proteases at the junction between S 1 and S 2 (S 2 cleavage site) occurs during biogenesis for some coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, the prototypical and best-studied coronavirus) 1,5 . The S 1 and S 2 subunits remain non-covalently associated in the metastable pre-fusion S trimer. After virion uptake by target cells, a second cleavage is mediated by endo-lysosomal proteases (S 2 \u2032 cleavage site), allowing fusion activation of coronavirus S proteins 6 .",

Additional contacts between the upstream and central helices participate to inter-protomer interactions. Furthermore, the S 1 subunits interlock to form a crown around the S 2 trimer stabilizing it in the pre-fusion conformation (Fig. 3c , d and Supplementary Table 3 ). This is illustrated by the large surface area buried at the interface between each S 1 subunit and the S 2 subunits of the three protomers (1,970 \u00c5 2 ). Many of these contacts involve the HR1 helices and the fusion peptide region. These polypeptide segments undergo major refolding during the fusogenic conformational changes (Extended Data Fig. 6a-e) , which supports the notion that the S 1 subunits maintain the S 2 fusion machinery in its metastable state. Substitutions of the conserved alanine 994 by valine in helix \u03b1 28 or of the conserved leucine 1062 by phenylalanine in the central helix were shown to attenuate fusogenicity 21, 22 . Our structure suggests that the former substitution would strengthen hydrophobic packing against the core \u03b2-sheet (Extended Data Fig. 7b) , and that the later substitution could reinforce molecular stapling of the central helices (Extended Data Fig. 7a , c). The expected modification of the energy landscape between pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations would explain the reduction in fusion activity of these mutants 21, 22 . ",

In the case of porcine epidemic diarrhoea coronavirus, trypsin processing at the S 2 \u2032 site can only occur after host cell attachment 24 . This indicates that receptor binding could allosterically increase the accessibility of the S 2 \u2032 site, which is located within helix \u03b1 21 . The acidic pH of the endolysosomes could also contribute to exposing the S 2 \u2032 cleavage site for coronaviruses requiring cleavage in this compartment. The fact that helix \u03b1 21 appears dynamic and is found immediately downstream from a disordered loop suggests that it could undergo considerable 'breathing' motions. Regardless of the mechanism promoting cleavage, the MHV S structure reported here explains the requirement for processing at the S 2 \u2032 site, as it frees the fusion peptide from the S 2 N-terminal region, which is a prerequisite for its insertion ~200 \u00c5 away in the target membrane. The peripheral position of the fusion peptide is similar to what has been observed in the parainfluenza virus 5 F 3 and HIV gp41 (ref. 25) prefusion structures (Extended Data Fig. 8a-c) . The notable accessibility of the fusion peptide and its sequence conservation among coronaviruses 6, 23 suggest that it would be an ideal target for epitope-focused vaccinology initiatives aimed at raising broadly neutralizing antibodies against S glycoproteins (Fig. 4a -c and Extended Data Fig. 9 ).

Data were analysed using Astra 6 software (Wyatt Technology Corp). MicroScale Thermophoresis. Solution MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) binding studies were performed using standard protocols on a Monolith NT.115 (Nanotemper Technologies). In brief, recombinant CEACAM1a ectodomain protein was labelled using the RED-NHS (Amine Reactive) Protein Labelling Kit (Nanotemper Technologies). The MHV S ectodomain protein was serially diluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and the labelled recombinant CEACAM1a was added to a final concentration of 500 nM before overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. The CEACAM1a concentration was chosen such that the observed fluorescence was approximately 1,000 U at 40% LED power. The samples were loaded into standard-treated Monolith capillaries and were measured by standard protocols using a Monolith NT.115, NanoTemper. The changes in the fluorescent thermophoresis signal were plotted against the concentration of the serially diluted MHV spike protein, and K d values were determined using the NanoTemper analysis software. CryoEM sample preparation and data collection. Three microlitres of MHV spike at 1.85 mg ml \u22121 was applied to a 1.2/1.3 C-flat grid (Protochips), which had been glow-discharged for 30 s at 20 mA. Thereafter, grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Gatan CP3 and a blotting time of 3.5 s. Data were acquired using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector. Coma-free alignment was performed using the Leginon software 33 . Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon 34 to control both the FEI Titan Krios (used in microprobe mode at a nominal magnification of 22,500\u00d7) and the Gatan K2 Summit operated in counted mode (pixel size: 1.315 \u00c5) at a dose rate of ~9 counts per physical pixel per s, which corresponds to ~12 electrons per physical pixels per s (when accounting for coincidence loss 35 ) . Each video had a total accumulated exposure of 53 e \u00c5 \u22122 fractionated in 38 frames of 200 ms (yielding movies of 7.6 s). A data set of ~1,600 micrographs was acquired in a single session using a defocus range of between 2.0 and 5.0 \u03bcm. CryoEM data processing. Whole-frame alignment was carried out using the software developed previously 35 , which is integrated into the Appion pipeline 36 , to account for stage drift and beam-induced motion. The parameters of the microscope contrast transfer function were estimated for each micrograph using ctffind3 (ref. 37) . Micrographs were manually masked using Appion to exclude the visible carbon supporting film for further processing. Particles were automatically picked in a reference-free manner using DogPicker 38 . Extraction of particle images was performed using Relion 1.4 with a box size of 320 pixels 2 and applying a windowing operation in Fourier space to yield a final box size of 288 pixels 2 (corresponding to a pixel size of 1.46 \u00c5). From the 1.2 million particles initially picked, a subset of 50,000 particles were randomly selected to generate class averages using RELION 39 . An initial 3D model was generated using OPTIMOD 40 within the Appion pipeline. The entire data set was subjected to 2D alignment and clustering using RELION and particles belonging to the best-defined class averages were retained (~500,000 particles). These ~500,000 particles were then subjected to RELION 3D classification with four classes (using c1 symmetry) starting with our initial model low-pass filtered to 40 \u00c5 resolution. We subsequently used the ~230,000 best particles (selected from the 3D classification) and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) to run Relion 3D auto-refine (c3 symmetry), which led to a reconstruction at 4.4 \u00c5 resolution. We used the particle polishing procedure in RELION 1.4 to correct for individual particle movement and radiation damage 41, 42 . A second round of 3D classification with 6 classes (c3 symmetry) was performed using the polished particles resulting in the selection of 82,000 particles. A new 3D auto-refine run (c3 symmetry) using the selected 82,000 particles and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) yielded a map at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution following post-processing in RELION. The final map was sharpened with an empirically determined B factor of \u2212220 \u00c5 2 using Relion post processing. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion 43 , and Fourier shell correction curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution 44 . The soft mask used for FSC calculation had a 10 pixel cosine edge fall-off. The overall shape and dimensions of our reconstruction agree with previous data although the HR2 stem connecting to the membrane is not resolved 15 . Model building and analysis. Fitting of atomic models into cryoEM maps was performed using UCSF Chimera 45 and Coot 18, 46 . We initially docked the MHV domain A structure (PDB 3R4D) and used a crystal structure of a bovine coronavirus domain A (PDB 4H14) to model the three-stranded \u03b2-sheet and the \u03b1-helix present on the viral membrane proximal side of the galectin-like domain. Next, the MERS-CoV domain B crystal structure (PDB 4KQZ) was also fit into the density, and rebuilt and refined using RosettaCM 47 . Although we could accurately align the sequences corresponding to the core \u03b2-sheet of the MHV and MERS-CoV B domains, the ~100 residues forming the \u03b2-motif extension (residues 453-535, MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV receptor-binding moiety) could not be aligned with confidence. We used RosettaCM to build models of each of the 945 possible disulfide patterns into the density for domain B. For each disulfide arrangement, 50 models were generated, and there was a very clear energy signal for a single such arrangement (Extended Data Fig. 3k) . Then, 1,000 models with this disulfide arrangement were sampled, and the lowest energy model (using the Rosetta force field augmented with a fit-to-density score term) was selected. Owing to the poor quality of the reconstruction at the apex of the S trimer, the confidence of the model is lowest for the segment corresponding to residues 453-535, as homology modelling was used to fill in details missing in the map.",

The presence of these di-proline motifs indicates that the post-fusion HR1 coiled-coil could not extend up to the fusion peptide as a single helix. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation of a conserved disulfide bond formed between residues Cys894 and Cys905 (labelled 14 in a and b) , which will prevent refolding of helices \u03b1 22 and Table 2 . The secondary structure elements observed in our MHV S reconstruction are indicated above the sequence. The black dotted lines above the sequence indicate regions poorly defined in the density. Although the viral membrane distal loops of the A domains are weakly defined in the density, the availability of a crystal structure of this domain from the same virus (PDB 3R4D) helped with the modelling.",
