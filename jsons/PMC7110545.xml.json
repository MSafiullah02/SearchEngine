            "text": "Recent decades have seen a rapid increase in the number of new viral diseases of humans, most of which are zoonotic. Concurrently, several existing viral zoonoses that had stable, limited geographical ranges (due mainly to disease control activities) have undergone resurgence. This has occurred at the same time as rapid growth in human populations and increasing economic globalisation. Associations between disease emergence, population growth and globalisation are related to urbanisation, deforestation, and construction of new infrastructure (such as highways, dams and irrigation systems). These all have an impact on vector habitat availability, inadequate supply of hygienic water (necessitating collection and storage of water, thereby providing more vector breeding sites), and the increase in international movement of humans, livestock and commodities, leading to carriage of exotic pathogens and vectors to new geographical areas (Gubler, 2002). Specific examples include the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) via air transportation and the spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), a potential vector species for several arboviruses, via international trade in used tyres and garden accoutrements (Benedict et al., 2007). Coupled with these developments are genetic evolutionary changes in viruses that have led to the appearance of novel pathogenic strains (Real et al., 2005a).",

As EVZ are expanding in their geographical range, it is essential to understand the epidemiological and ecological drivers of these diseases. Spatial epidemiology is the study of the spatial distribution of disease and associated factors. Geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS), spatial statistics and spatially-explicit mathematical models constitute a powerful suite of tools for the study, prevention and control of EVZ and other infectious diseases. Applications include analysing, explaining and predicting the spatiotemporal dimensions of epidemics, understanding the environmental determinants of disease distributions (particularly climatic and landscape features), refining risk-based surveillance approaches (where surveillance resources are allocated to areas or sub-populations having the greatest estimated risk of disease emergence or outbreaks) (Stark et al., 2006), and geographical targeting and evaluation of interventions, leading to improved efficiency in the distribution of scarce resources.",

(2005) reported that an abundance of WNV vectors in Texas was associated with temperature and precipitation, whilst Ward et al. (2005) and Brownstein et al.

With WNV, urban landscapes have been identified as potentially important areas of disease activity (Ruiz et al., 2007).

Incorporation of spatial relationships between analytical units (individuals, farms, administrative areas) in mathematical models enables accommodation of heterogeneous mixing of populations (i.e. where pairs of individuals have contact probabilities that are dependent on the distance and direction between them, or modified by topographic barriers or human imposition of movement restrictions) and heterogeneous transmission probabilities, that might be related to the environment (e.g. wind speed and direction for airborne viruses, climate-dependent insect densities for vector-borne diseases), distance and direction from exposure sites or heterogeneous distribution of interventions such as vaccines. The importance of distance-dependent transmission was demonstrated by Boender et al. (2007), who reported that between-flock transmission probabilities of HPAI H7N7 decreased with distance from infected poultry farms during the 2003 epidemic in the Netherlands. Recently, mathematical modellers have aimed to incorporate spatially heterogeneous mixing and transmission probabilities in their models. This has tended to increase model complexity but often gives a more accurate representation of disease dynamics; a trade-off that is an important consideration for all modelling approaches.",

One major reason is that, in common with other fields of epidemiology, data quality is often inadequate \u2013 reliable predictions depend on high-quality input data, regardless of the sophistication of the statistical methods used. In spatial epidemiology, datasets used were not usually collected for spatial analytical purposes and have limitations with respect to geographical coverage and density, and accuracy of georeferencing. While many mathematical and statistical modelling approaches have been developed to make best use of sub-optimal or incomplete data, epidemiologists still need to work more closely with public health officials on improving the quality of surveillance data and (ideally) designing field surveys or surveillance methods that explicitly accommodate subsequent spatial analysis. We argue that better evidence, including practical demonstration, of the benefits of spatial epidemiological approaches will lead to increased investment by public health funding bodies to collect better quality data.",

There have been few examples of spatial epidemiological studies where tangible improvements in the prevention and control of EVZ have been successfully demonstrated. Secondly, while maps can provide valuable tools for resource-allocation planning, few studies have made the leap from spatial prediction to integration of disease mapping into a resource-allocation plan for EVZ control, or to inform risk-based surveillance. An example of the former in the field of tropical parasitic disease (schistosomiasis) epidemiology was presented by Clements et al. (2006a), who mapped intervention zones based on parasitological field data and spatial statistical models. In an example of the latter, a spatial risk assessment of a bacterial zoonosis (salmonellosis) was used to inform risk-based surveillance of this disease (Benschop et al., 2008).",
