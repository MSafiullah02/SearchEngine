It has rapidly transmitted and become a major concern all over the world. As of April 3, 2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 1,033,060 worldwide, with 54,677 (5.29%) deaths [1]. Apart from supportive care, oxygen supply in mild cases, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and low-dose corticosteroids in critical cases, intravenous remdesivir and convalescent plasma might be the effective potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of them in COVID-19 treatment. The specific and novel therapeutic methods for this disease are still being explored.",

The pathologic changes are similar with acute lung injure (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2], also observed in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. However, more serious inflammatory exudation, pulmonary edema and inflammatory cytokine storm, and milder pulmonary fibrosis and consolidation were observed in severe or critical COVID-19 than those in SARS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which originate from bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord, placenta, and other tissues, have abundant supply, differentiation potential, powerful immunoregulation, and endogenous repair mechanisms. As one of the most widely studied adult stem cells in regenerative medicine, MSCs produce meaningful therapeutic outcomes for the treatment of pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological, liver, and kidney diseases. The immune-regulation of MSCs depends mainly on modulating activation and effector function of immune cells, suppressing lung-infiltrated cells, and enhancing the resolution of pulmonary edema [3]. The incomplete revealed mechanisms but critical roles of MSCs on anti-inflammatory effects imply that MSCs is a potential therapy for severe and critical COVID-19.",

They can release keratinocyte growth factor, prostaglandin E2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-6 and IL-13 to facilitate the phagocytosis and alternative activation of alveolar macrophage, alter the cytokine secretion profile of dendritic cell subsets, and decrease the release of interferon \u03b3 from natural killer cells. IL-10, transforming growth factor \u03b2, and tryptophan catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase secreted from them can also suppress the proliferation of T cells and change the cytokine secretion profile of T cell subsets [7]. Moreover, the proliferation, differentiation, and chemotactic properties of B cells were impaired by MSCs as well [8]. Except for the immune regulatory effects, MSCs can enhance restoration of capillary barrier [9], inhibit bacterial growth [10], and restore alveolar ATP [11]. All the functions mentioned above might also be effective on ARDS induced by COVID-19 infection.",

The inclusion criteria are according to the Berlin definition of ARDS [12] in common, while the START trial [13] had a more strict definition of moderate-to-severe ARDS with 4 categories: (1) positive pressure ventilation by an endotracheal or tracheal tube with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of < 200 with at least 8 cm H2O positive end-expiratory airway pressure, (2) bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on the frontal chest radiograph, (3) without clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension or a pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure \u2264 18 mmHg, and (4) categories 1\u20133 must be present within a 24-h time period and at the time of enrolment. Exclusion criteria included patients younger than 18 years, pre-existing severe disease of any major organs, pregnancy, malignant disease, severe chronic respiratory disease, recent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or if informed consent could not be obtained. In addition, the patients in whom more than 96 h since first meeting the Berlin definition for ARDS had also been excluded in the START trial to avoid enrolling patients with late ARDS. The completed clinical trials demonstrate that MSCs are well tolerated without adverse effects in ALI/ARDS (Table 1) [14, 15]. Additionally, acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to its inflammatory storm. A meta-analysis revealed that infused MSCs could reduce acute GVHD grade and increase overall survival [16]. The therapeutic effects of MSCs on ALI/ARDS and GVHD with powerful inflammatory balance are solid proofs for the application of MSCs on other originated ALI/ARDS.\n",

Importantly, MSCs can cure the patients with severe refractory ARDS [20], who failed to improve after both standard life support measures including mechanical ventilation and additional measures including extracorporeal ventilation, pointing that MSC could be used for serious viral ALI/ARDS. Some Chinese research groups triggered the clinical studies on MSCs treating critical COVID-19 (Table 1). In the trigged clinical trials, the inclusion criteria for severe or critical COVID-19 include respiratory rate (RR) \u2265 30 times/min, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) at rest \u2264 93%, partial pressure of PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 300 mmHg, requirement for mechanical ventilation, shock, etc. As of February 21, 2020, four patients with severe COVID-19 were recovered and discharged by MSCs therapy in China [21]. Therefore, we believe that MSCs would be a new effective therapeutic method for severe or critical COVID-19.",
