Unfortunately, radiography and ultrasound used in such cases do not allow to estimate the volume of the lung lesions; therefore, alternative diagnostic methods are required.

In the basal sections of the lower lobe of the right lung, a section of the non-homogeneously enhanced intensity of the MR signal in T2WI (a) is determined against the background of the hypointensive lung parenchyma -a symptom of \"clouds in sky\" -\"cloudy sky sign\". These changes are less pronounced on Lava Flex Water (b) and DWI b = 500 sec/mm 2 (d), probably due to the lower sensitivity of these pulse sequences to unexpressed pulmonary parenchyma edema. IDEAL Water (c) represents a significantly amplified signal from this section, however, differentiation due to low spatial resolution is extremely difficult. In the lung parenchyma, the \"cloudy sky sign\" (a) is determined bilaterally on T2WI, which against the background of artifacts from a chest excursion is not reliably visualized on Lava Flex Water (b), while IDEAL Water (c) shows strongly marked and extensive changes, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the lesion. On DWI b = 500 sec/mm 2 (d), one-sided (right-sided) changes are noted, which might be a predictor of the development of consolidation, however, this hypothesis requires confirmation. .

However, the possibilities of MR imaging in relation to visualization of the lungs are constantly expanding due to both the technical improvement of MR equipment and the emergence of more complex pulse sequences and techniques [6, 7] .
