Prior to the medical encounter, the diagnostic possibilities are enormous ranging from medical and surgical diseases to the field of psychiatry. Infectious diseases in theory offer the greatest opportunities for specific nonsurgical treatment of illness. The key to a favorable outcome is an astute clinician who seeks appropriate clinical, occupational, social, and travel history; considers wisely the potential epidemiological exposures; and gathers incisive data from the physical examination, radiological studies, and laboratory testing. The intermediate result is a prioritized list of differential diagnoses with focus on identifying diseases with the highest clinical consequences and those that are amenable to treatment.",
