The codon usage was optimized according to Escherichia coli expression preferences. To get the DNA fragments which encode the 2-Helix peptide containing the linker SGGRGG, a group of overlapping synthesized primers according to the published sequences was designed following the method we described previously [13]. Then the DNAs of HR1 and HR2 were amplified by standard PCR method utilizing the DNA of 2-Helix as template. The genes of 2-Helix, HR1, HR2 with BamHI/XhoI sites at the ends were inserted into the BamHI\u2013XhoI restriction sites of the GST fusion expression vector pGEX-6p-1 (Pharmacia). The positive plasmids were verified by direct DNA sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were named BIV-2-Helix, BIV-HR1, BIV-HR2, FIV-2-Helix, FIV-HR1, and FIV-HR2, respectively.",

            "text": "Two different programs, LearnCoil-VMF and Coils, were employed to predict the heptad repeat regions for the BIV Env protein. As illustrated in the research work of Kim and co-workers [12], LearnCoil-VMF is a specialized program for identifying the coiled-coil-like regions that compose the trimer-of-hairpins motif in viral membrane fusion proteins. Results show that this program is able to predict two such regions (corresponding to HR1 and HR2) in almost all viral membrane fusion proteins, including retrovirus envelope proteins, paramyxovirus fusion proteins, orthomyxovirus hemagglutinins, coronavirus spike proteins, arenavirus glycoproteins, and baculovirus envelope glycoproteins. Most of these predictions have been supported by the crystal structures [9], [14], [15], [16], [10], [17], [18]. In the lentiviruses, two HR regions were successfully predicted by LearnCoil-VMF in the envelope proteins of HIV-1, SIV, FIV, Visna virus, and CAEV. Instead, only one HR region was detected in the Env protein from BIV with the same program (Fig. 1\nA). However, another completely different region can be predicted with high likelihood in BIV Env by the Coils program (Fig. 1A). These two predicted regions are located in the similar positions of HR1 and HR2, which occur also in the Envs of other lentiviruses, like HIV and FIV (Fig. 1C). Therefore, it might be suggested that the two regions predicted by LearnCoil-VMF and Coils were corresponding to HR1 and HR2, respectively (Figs. 1A and B). The amino acid sequence multiple alignments also indicate the similar characters of the possible HR1 and HR2 of BIV Env as those of other lentiviruses, in which the residues a, d in the heptad repeats are almost all hydrophobic amino acids (Figs. 2\nA and B).",

This observation might indicate that the 2-Helix protein could form polymers. Further analysis by chemical cross-linking confirmed the trimer formation of 2-Helix (Fig. 4\nA). Instead of the natural connecting sequence, linker SGGRGG is utilized to connect HR1 and HR2, omitting the disulfide bond present in the natural state. The resulting trimer structure of 2-Helix shows that the interaction between HR1 and HR2 in BIV is most probably an intrinsic tendency, demanding no external impact such as a covalent bond. This is also true in other lentiviruses. The same results were also obtained with FIV 2-Helix protein (Fig. 4B).

The CD spectra showed that both BIV and FIV 2-helixes had minima at 208 and 222 nm, consistent with a typical \u03b1-helix structure (Fig. 5\nA). The CD spectra of HR1s also indicate the characteristic of \u03b1-helix, while HR2 appeared to be largely random coils characterized by a minimum around 200 nm. However, the mixture of HR1 and HR2 in equimolar amounts at room temperature for 1 h exhibited a CD spectrum curve with intensified double minima at 208 and 222 nm compared to HR1 or HR2 alone, which indicates a higher \u03b1-helix content, demonstrating the helical interaction of HR1 and HR2 (Figs. 5C and D). Thermodynamic stability analysis also showed that the 2-Helix protein was thermal-stable with a T\nm as high as 80 \u00b0C (Fig. 5B). All these results provide the evidence that the predicted HR1 and HR2 peptides of BIV can form a stable six-helix bundle or a trimer of HR1/HR2 heterodimers, which might represent the core structure of Env protein at the postfusion state. This core structure has been well studied in the family of lentiviruses as well as many other enveloped viruses. Therefore, BIV might share the same fusion mechanism as the other lentiviruses and the HR peptides could also be inhibitors of virus fusion.",

It is also interesting to determine the fusion inhibition activity of the peptides, which had been confirmed on HIV [19] and FIV [20]. In the tests of cell fusion inhibition, syncytium formations were actually inhibited by the treatment of GST-HR2, while syncytia were not affected in the cell monolayers tested with GST and GST-2-Helix (Fig. 6\n). According to our previous research on Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the fusion partner GST (26 kDa) does not affect the inhibition [21]. The non-inhibition of GST-2-Helix indicates that HR2 peptides work as competitors to the endogenous HR2 regions by binding to the HR1 sites of Env. The IC50 value of HR2 was measured to be 1.17 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM. This result shows again that BIV shares the similar fusion mechanism as HIV. For enveloped virus, it has been shown that, unlike the HR2 regions, not all HR1s show fusion inhibitory effects [19], [21]. More importantly, in our system the GST fusion HR2 showed an inhibitory effect similar to that of free HR2s in other viruses [19].",

The HR1 and HR2 peptides from BIV show exactly the same interacting activities as those shown by corresponding regions in other lentiviruses, which indicates the probability of similar roles in virus-cell fusion. This is another evidence, which demonstrates that all the envelope proteins from different lentiviruses have common structure features, despite the lack of sequence homology among them. Thereby, the same fusion mechanism based on structural similarities is shared by these viruses, and a universal antiviral strategy could be used.",

In HIV-1, the C-peptides (derived from HR2), effective at nanomolar concentrations, are much more potent than N-peptides (derived from HR1), which require micromolar concentrations for effectiveness. The C-peptides could inhibit entry by competitively binding to the conserved groove on surface of the endogenous HR1 central coiled-coil trimer, which is also the binding site of outer C helices within viral gp41. The N-peptide might inhibit fusion by interfering with formation of the central, coiled-coil trimer within viral gp41 and/or by binding to endogenous viral HR2 region [9]. The broad inhibitory activity of C peptides against diverse HIV isolates is explained by the highly conserved hydrophobic groove to which these peptides bind. Toward the bottom of the groove is a deep cavity that is filled by three hydrophobic residues from the C helix. This pocket is potentially a good target for inhibiting HIV invasion [1]. Our study shows that HR2 in BIV has a strong inhibitory activity against virus-cell fusion.",

The crystal structures of the trimer of HR1/HR2 heterodimers in HIV-1, SIV, and Visna virus of lentiviruses, as well as Ebola of filoviruses, SV5 and HRSV of paramyxoviruses, and mouse hepatitis virus of coronaviruses, indicate that three HR1 domains are parallel coiled-coil in the interior of the bundle, and three HR2 domains are packed in an antiparallel manner in the grooves of the HR1 trimer.
