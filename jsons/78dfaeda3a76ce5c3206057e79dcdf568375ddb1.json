            "text": "The traditional drug discovery focuses on identifying direct inhibitors of target proteins. This approach typically relies on a specific measurable biochemical readout and amenable binding sites of which the occupancy directly influences the target protein's function. These requirements preclude many disease-causing proteins from being \"druggable\" targets, and these proteins are categorized as \"undruggable\". The proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology provides powerful tools to degrade these \"undruggable\" targets and has become a promising approach for drug discovery. However, the PROTAC technology may have limitations and emerging new degrader technologies may greatly broaden the spectrum of targets that could be selectively degraded by harnessing another major degradation pathway in cells. Here we review a few key emerging technologies that exploit the lysosomal degradation pathway and discuss their potential applications as well as limitations.",

However, the MetAP-2 covalently-bound moiety was a peptide, hindering the further application towards therapeutic research due to its large molecule size that leads to poor cellular penetration. In 2008, a cell-permeable PROTAC molecule linking the non-steroidal androgen receptor ligand (SARM) and the MDM2 ligand nutlin with a PEG-based linker was synthesized [19] . This PROTAC molecule can induce the ubiquitination of the androgen receptor and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This PROTAC system is based on MDM2, which is the major E3 ligase ubiquitinating the tumor suppressor protein p53 [20] . The nutlins family consists of small molecules that bind to the p53-binding pocket of MDM2 and thus competitively inhibit the interaction between p53 and MDM2 [21] , inducing possible off-target effects. The nutlins was further improved to RG7112 [22] and RG7388 [23] , with superior potency and selectivity. In 2010, a new PROTAC system using the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) ubiquitin ligase was established. Hashimoto and colleagues verified that the hybrid molecule coupling the cIAP1 ligand methyl bestatin and the ligand of CRABPs can induce degradation of CRABP-II in cells via the proteasomal pathway [24] . In 2015, the Bradner group has first established another important PROTAC system based on cereblon (CRBN) [25] . CRBN was initially identified as the primary mediator of the teratogenic activity of thalidomide by Handa and colleagues [26] . The immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) including thalidomide and its derivatives such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide were later on utilized to treat multiple myeloma [27] . These IMiDs were further reported to interact with the CRBN-DNA damage binding protein-1 (DDB1) complex [28] . Shortly after, a series of PROTAC molecules consist of CRBN-binding IMiD connected with small-molecule ligands of different POIs were designed and their degrader capability was verified [25, 29, 30] . For example, the JQ1-penalidomide chimeric compounds can selectively degrade the BRD4 protein via CRBN [25] . Another PROTAC system, the VHL-PROTAC system based on HIF1-\u03b1 derived peptide was initially introduced in 2004 [31] .",

Therefore, the degradation induced by PROTACs is sub-stoichiometric, i.e. one PROTAC molecule is able to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of multiple POI molecules. The catalytic nature of PROTACs provides potential strong degradation power with relatively low concentrations, and it is sometimes desired to have temporal and spatial control of this power. Recent studies have developed controllable PROTACs, such as photoswitchable azobenzene-PROTACs (Azo-PROTACs) and photo-caged PROTACs (pc-PROTACs) [34, 35] . Azo-PROTACs are light-controlled small-molecule tools for protein knockdown in cells. The light-induced configuration change can switch the active state to induce protein degradation activity, which can be reversely controlled by light exposure in intact cells [34] . For pc-PROTACs, photo-removable blocking groups were added to a degrader of Brd4, and the resulting molecule showed potent degradation activity in live cells only after light irradiation [35] .",

The lysosomal degradation pathway includes the endosome-lysosome pathway and the autophagy pathway (reviewed in [39, 40] ). The endosome-lysosome pathway is mediate through a series of transformation between several membrane-bound intracellular compartments: the endocytosed material is incorporated and proceeds through the early endosomes, the endosome carrier vesicle, the late endosome and the lysosome for subsequent hydrolysis [39] . The autophagy pathway starts with an isolated membrane structure called a phagophore, which is derived from lipid bilayer with lipidated LC3 proteins [41] . This phagophore expands to engulf intracellular cargoes (autophagy substrates), including proteins and other biomolecules or even organelles, thereby sequestering them in a double-membraned vesicle called the autophagosome [40] . The loaded autophagosome matures through fusion with the lysosome, leading to degradation of the cargoes.",

Excitingly, LYTAC molecules may work on extracellular proteins as well as membrane-bound proteins such as EGFR [42] . These types of proteins are typically resistant to PROTAC, which mainly targets intracellular proteins. An LYTAC molecule consists of an antibody to a specific POI, with a 20-or 90-mer of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) covalently attached to this antibody. M6P is a glycan mark to target proteins for degradation by binding to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 / 23 the cation-independent M6P receptor (CI-M6PR) [42] . Thus, the M6P-conjugated antibodies, i.e. the LYTAC molecules, are recognized by this endogenous system for lysosomal degradation of glycosylated proteins, bring the POIs together with them to the lysosome for degradation. In certain cases, the M6P-conjugated antibodies could be replaced by CI-M6PR's polypeptide ligands conjugated to a small molecule binding to the POI. The authors confirmed that a polypeptide with multiple ligands for CI-M6PR attached to biotin (a high affinity binder to Avidin) targets the extracellular NeutrAvidin protein to the endosomes and lysosomes [42] . The advantage of the LYTAC technology is that it enables degradation of both extracellular and membrane POIs, and it utilizes a ubiquitously expressed endogenous degradation pathway. The major limitation is that LYTAC molecules are quite large, and thus lose the desired properties of small-molecule compound drugs. The antibody or polypeptide nature of the molecules may also induce immune responses [43] .",

The degradation tag mimics S-Guanylation, a posttranslational modification of Cys-cGMP adducts formed by treatment of 8-nitro-cGMP or similar compounds [48] .

            "text": "The concept of autophagosome-tethering compound (ATTEC) illustrates a more direct strategy to harness autophagy to degrade POIs [50, 51] . Different from PROTAC and AUTAC, ATTEC molecules are independent of ubiquitination. Instead, ATTEC molecules tether the POI with the autophagosomes through their direct binding to the POI and the key autophagosome protein LC3. The proof-of-concept study established a high-throughput screening strategy to identify such compounds targeting the mutant HTT protein (mHTT), which is the Huntington's disease-(HD-) causing protein with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch [52] . The study J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 10 / 23 demonstrated that these compounds can degrade mHTT both in cells and in vivo in the animal models, and can rescue HD-relevant phenotypes [51] . The study also confirmed that these compounds can target mHTT to the autophagsomes for subsequent degradation without influencing the autophagy activity per se. By the counter-screen against binders of the wild-type HTT protein (wtHTT), the discovered ATTEC molecules are allele-selective, i.e., they degrade mHTT without influencing the wtHTT level. In vitro experiments revealed that these compounds specifically interact with the expanded polyQ stretch, possibly by recognizing its unique structural feature that is different from short polyQ stretch [53, 54] . Thus, the discovered ATTEC molecules are also capable of degrading other disease-causing polyQ proteins, such as mutant ATXN3, which causes spinocerebellar ataxia type III [51] . Some of the discovered ATTEC molecules are able to pass the blood-brain barrier and function at ~100 nM concentrations [51] , providing encouraging entry points for drug discovery. By interacting with the autophagosome protein LC3 directly and bypassing the ubiquitination process, ATTEC molecules may have great potential in degrading different types of cargoes, including autophagy-recognized non-protein cargoes such as DNA/RNA molecules, damaged organelles, etc., via a direct mechanism. ATTEC molecules do not influence global autophagy activity [51] , whereas it remains to be elucidated if AUTACs do. It is important not to perturb global autophagy, because this may minimize nonspecific degradation of functional proteins and organelles.",

Given the poor capability of the proteasome in degrading these aggregates/oligomers [37] , autophagy hijacking degraders may have a better capability to target protein aggregates for selective degradation, at least in theory. Consistent with this, one of the discovered ATTEC molecules reduced mutant HTT aggregates significantly [51] .

Further studies revealed that a putative RNA transporter SIDT2 mediates the RNA translocation across the lysosomal membrane [67, 68] . Thus, scientists may screen for high-affinity binding molecules of LAMP2C or SIDT2 and attach them to antisense oligonucleotides or small molecules specifically binding to the target RNA. These chimeric molecules may selectively degrade the target RNA and knock down its encoded pathogenic proteins. This may provide a novel degrader technology for RNA, in addition to the recent nuclease-targeting RNA degrader technology developed by the Disney group [69] . For the DNA molecules, the clearance of cytosolic DNA molecules under pathological conditions is highly desired. Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) detects infections or tissue damage by binding to microbial or self DNA in the cytoplasm [70] . Upon binding to the DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP that binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING [71] , which induces LC3 lipidation and activates autophagy [72] . The cGAMP-induced autophagy is critical for the clearance of DNA and viruses in the cytosol [72] . This provides a promising possibility of using the autophagy-targeting degrader technologies to enhance the clearance of these DNA molecules and their relevant pathogens or damaged cellular components.",

This approach may provide synergistic effects with xenophagy enhancement approaches that have been studied recently to control bacterial infection [75] . Another potential strategy is to target the microbial DNA/RNA to autophagic degradation by ATTEC as discussed in the previous paragraph. The pathogen COVID-19 responsible for the recent pneumonia outbreak could be targeted by the design above as well [76] (see \"Outstanding Questions\"). Meanwhile, many pathogens have evolved ways to subvert or exploit this defense mechanism, minimizing the actual effectiveness of xenophagy in innate immunity [73, 77] .
