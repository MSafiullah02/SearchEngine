Case fatality rates among hospitalized patients vary from 10-26% (2) (3) (4) (5) . It has been suggested that high rates of viral replication during the initial stable phase of disease can lead to a massive cytokine release syndrome and clinical deterioration in certain patients (6) . Clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of a variety of antiviral drugs as well as other medications such as hydroxychloroquine with potential anti-inflammatory effects. However, some of these drugs have known toxicities, and to date no drug has been proven to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients.",

In vitro, famotidine has demonstrated antiviral properties by inhibiting HIV replication (7) . Recently, Wu et al. used computational methods to predict structures of proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, and then identified existing compounds that could potentially act on SARS-CoV-2 targets (8) . The authors identified famotidine as one of the drugs most likely to inhibit 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ). 3CL pro is key to proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV-2 polypeptide into the non-structure proteins that are essential for viral replication (9) . The gene encoding 3CL pro is highly conserved, and thus 3CL pro represents an attractive drug discovery target (10) .",
