In this period, she remained stable with 111 no oxygen requirement and the fetal heart traces were normal. During the procedure there 112 was clear evidence of placental abruption, with significant intra-uterine clots on entry to the 113 uterus and a 400ml retroplacental blood clot. The blood loss was 1\u00b77 litres, excluding the 114 APH. She did not require a blood transfusion and was managed postnatally in isolation with 115 one to one care. 116Both twins required positive pressure respiratory resuscitation, twin one by endotracheal tube 117 and twin 2 by mask. The Apgar scores were 5, 8, 8 and 8, 9, 9 for twin one (2190g) and two 118 (2160g) respectively and umbilical cord pH as follows: twin one arterial, base excess: 7.215, 119 -3.2 ; venous, base excess: 7.319, -2.9 and twin 2 arterial, base excess: 7.285, intubated in neonatal intensive care unit. The mother expressed breastmilk. Both 122 babies were negative for COVID-19 PCR on postnatal days three and five. rare in MCDA twins, in an otherwise normal pregnancy as was the case here 132 (<2%).6 The association between placental abruption and COVID-19 infection in pregnancy 133 is uncertain. However, our patient had no recognised risk factors for placental abruption,(30 134 years old, BMI 23, non-smoker, with no history of alcohol or recreational drug use, 135 normotensive at booking (120/54) and on admission (103/68), anterior high placenta), and 136 cases of abruption have been reported with other coronavirus spectrum infections. 6 The 137 abruption maybe incidental but as COVID-19 can affect maternal haemostatic parameters, we 138 advise further caution with careful surveillance with antepartum haemorrhage in positive 139 women until more data are available. 140 141 Placental histology did not show any maternal or fetal inflammatory response or lymphocytic 142 inclusions, as is commonly noted in acute viral infections but there was evidence of 143 accelerated villous maturation suggesting hypoperfusion over days, which we believe is the 144 first description of placental pathology in the context of COVID-19. These are non-specific 145 placental changes which can occur in other conditions, e.g: Pre-eclampsia, but given the 146 absence of additional features like decidual vasculopathy and partial agglutination of the villi, 147often present in pre-eclampsia, and normal growth of both twins on serial scans, the mother was relatively well and not requiring oxygen, but had 152 thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia typically associated with COVID-19, abnormal 153 chest X-Rays, with a mild pericardial effusion on cardiac echo. We believe the pericardial 154 effusion was unrelated to COVID-19 as the BNP was normal. Neither the abruption or 155 preterm birth was associated with vertical transmission to the baby. 156157This was the first case of an obstetric emergency where the mother was known to have 158 COVID-19 in our hospital. Full PPE was donned but took time, and we advise training for 159 such emergencies, as placental abruption can often be associated with acute fetal distress 160 requiring urgent delivery in minutes. 161 162 Initial COVID-19 PCR was negative, when taken from the throat, soon after developing 163 typical symptoms. False negative results have been reported with a poorer positive predictive 164 value for throat swabs (her first swab), compared to nasal swabs (her second swab), 24% v 165 57% respectively. 5 Tests five to six days following symptoms are most likely to identify the 166 disease. Reorganization of the delivery of obstetric care in the current pandemic (e.g. virtual 167 consultations) has re-emphasised the value of comprehensive history taking, and triaging for 168 a face-to-face attendance, including repeat testing, where there is any suspicion",

This maybe 41 related to cite of sampling. 5 42We report a case of a monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy who presented at 32 weeks 44 of gestation with cough, fever and shortness of breath, and tested positive for COVID-19, 45 having had a negative swab two weeks prior, when she initially presented with symptoms. 46 She was delivered by emergency caesarean section at 32 +6 weeks due to an antepartum 47 haemorrhage, with placental abruption confirmed clinically at delivery, and placental 48 pathology demonstrating hypoperfusion, which may have been related. Both babies were 49We present this case to highlight the following important issues; potential association 51 between COVID-19 infection with placental abruption, and placental pathology; the absence 52 of vertical transmission in the context of preterm birth and placental abruption; need for 53 repeat testing with worsening or persistent symptoms, and the importance of clinical 54 bleeding (50ml), associated with lower back pain. She was a non-smoker, with no history of 62 alcohol or recreational drug use and was normotensive at booking (120/54mm/Hg) and on 63She had been reviewed fortnightly in the Multiple Pregnancy Clinic and there were no 66 concerns of shared placentation from serial growth scans (inter-twin discordance 3-4%, and 67 normal amniotic fluid, with both twins growing around the 50 th centile). The placenta was 68 reported as anterior high. A glucose tolerance test performed at 26 weeks', due to her 69 ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and multiple pregnancy, was negative for gestational 70 diabetes. In 2014 she had a thyroidectomy following a papillary cell carcinoma and was 71 clinically euthyroid on thyroxine 200mcg (which was titrated in pregnancy to her TSH 72On the day she presented with an APH, it was noted that her husband had visited the 76 Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) and received antibiotics for a chest infection the 77 previous day. Upon arrival in the Maternity Assessment Unit, on examination, her abdomen 78 was soft, with clots seen on vaginal speculum examination, with normal maternal 79 observations (seetable). The haemoglobin result was 111g/l, blood group rhesus positive, 80 with no atypical antibodies. She was admitted, and her partner advised to return home to self-81 isolate (he had not been tested for COVID-19.) His COVID-19 PCR test was subsequently 82 sent but was negative. 83Although the woman did not meet criteria for testing, a COVID-19 PCR was sent to plan 85 delivery, in case of contact. A course of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity, 86 (intramuscular dexamethasone 9\u00b79mg) was given on the 12 th and 13 th March. On the second 87 day of her admission, she developed a sore throat and shortness of breath; her COVID-19 88 PCR was reported as negative (throat swab) and she was discharged home, with advice to 89 self-isolate for 14 days. 90Two weeks later, she attended the hospital for her 32-week growth scan and to discuss her 92 birth plan. She reported some itching on the day, and bloods were sent to rule out Obstetric 93Cholestasis. When she was contacted later that day with the blood test results in a virtual 94 consultation she reported feeling weak and feverish, with pink coloured urine. She was 95",
