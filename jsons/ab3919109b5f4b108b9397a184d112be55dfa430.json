In children, the clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus are similar to those produced by respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild to severe diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of human metapneumovirus and other common respiratory viruses among admitted to hospital infants. From January 2006 to June 2006, 99 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children younger than 12 months in order to study respiratory viruses. Human metapneumovirus detection was performed by cell culture and two RT-PCR targeting on polymerase and fusion genes. The latter gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. In 67/99 children (67%) at least one viral pathogen was identified, the viruses detected most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus (35%), human metapneumovirus (25%) and rhinovirus (19%). The results obtained in this study, show that: (1) human metapneumovirus is one of the most important viruses among children less than 12 months; (2) children infected with human metapneumovirus were significantly older than those infected by respiratory syncytial virus; (3) human metapneumovirus was associated more frequently with pneumonia whereas respiratory syncytial virus was only detected in patients with bronchiolitis; (4) there was a clear epidemiological succession pattern with only a small overlap among the viruses detected most frequently; (5) all human metapneumovirus samples were clustered within sublineage A2.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus was discovered recently as a respiratory virus implicated in both upper and lower respiratory tract infection ranging from mild to severe disease in all age groups [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] . Since then, it has been reported in Europe, Asia, Australia, South Africa and America [Peret et al., 2002; Bastien et al., 2003; Jpma et al., 2004; Rao et al., 2004; Sloots et al., 2006; Brooks et al., 2007] , suggesting worldwide distribution. Seroprevalence studies have shown that this virus has been present among humans for over five decades [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Hamelin et al., 2004] . Human metapneumovirus was not discovered previously due to its difficulty to grow in traditional cell cultures, although it has slow growth in the Rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2) cell line [Deffrasnes et al., 2005] . Although monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are being developed [Landry et al., 2005; Percivalle et al., 2005] , these are not available commercially for direct antigen detection in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), and molecular assays remain the main approach available currently for human metapneumovirus identification. Human metapneumovirus has a negative-strand RNA genome of approximately 13 kb encapsidated by a helicoidal nucleocapsid and covered with a lipid bilayer [van den Hoogen et al., 2002; Biacchesi et al., 2003] . It has been classified in the Pneumovirus subfamily of the Paramyxovirus family, which also contains the respiratory syncytial virus and Metapneumovirus genus. Currently, two main genotypes A and B with the subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2 are identified by molecular methods [Biacchesi et al., 2003] .",

To detect human metapneumovirus types A and B, in addition to the widely used primers of L gene that do not hybridize to type B [Sarasini et al., 2006 ], a second nested PCR test using fusion gene (F) primers was performed. First round PCR used the following primers: Ff1, 5 0 TTC GTT CTA GGA GCA A 3 0 and Fr, 5 0 GTC TTC CTG TCG TAA CTT TG 3 0 . The second round used an inner forward primer Ff 5 0 ATG CCA ACA TCT GCA GGA C 3 0 and the same reverse primer as in the first step, obtaining a final product of 450 pb. Amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide.

As an human metapneumovirus positive control, RNA of human metapneumovirus (subtype A2, according to strain Canada 97/83) was used in the PCR test. Each set of RT-PCR reaction included a positive control for extraction and amplification handling obtained from our viral lysates, when available, and a negative control (viral transport medium containing no nucleic acid).

Sequencing the F amplicons of human metapneumovirus strains identified from NPA and their subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that only type A2 of human metapneumovirus circulated among patients included during the study period (Fig. 2) . All human metapneumovirus samples tested were found in the same cluster sharing a nucleotide identity of 88.4% with a slightly higher amino acid similarity of 89%. Notably, when the same sequences were examined leaving out P15 and P19 patients, the similarity increased to 91%. In the phylogenetic tree, both sequences seemed to form a different cluster within the subtype A2 (Fig. 2) . The present study is based on the first half of the year, thus it is difficult to establish a distribution of viruses detected during the follow-up.

Several studies have demonstrated that human metapneumovirus is more likely to be associated with bronchiolitis in early childhood [Xepapadaki et al., 2004; Garcia-Garcia et al., 2007; do Carmo Debur et al., 2007] . However, other investigations including the present study found that human metapneumovirus was associated more frequently with bronchopneumonia compared to human metapneumovirus-bronchiolitis cases [Choi et al., 2006; Brooks et al., 2007] . These variable results may reflect that human metapneumovirus is not exclusively a bronchiolitis pathogen and can, also cause bronchopneumonia among infants. It probably indicates that human metapneumovirus causes a spectrum of lower respiratory tract illness, with a tendency toward the more severe end, namely pneumonia. In the study sample, human metapneumovirus was present in 25% of patients causing either bronchiolitis or broncopneumonia, a percentage second only to respiratory syncytial virus (35%) and surpassing rhinovirus (19%) . Compared to other studies, a higher rate of human metapneumovirus infection was obtained, considering that it is responsible normally for 5-10% of hospitalizations of children suffering from acute respiratory tract infections [Jpma et al., 2004; Deffrasnes et al., 2007] . However, these rates reflect data from only the first half of the year, corresponding to the peak infection period and thus, increasing the proportion of human metapneumovirus cases. Probably, it has led to an overestimate of the real prevalence. Dual viral infections are frequent in childhood, mainly in infants, but to date they were not associated with an increased severity of illness [Williams et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2006; van Woensel et al., 2006 ]. In contrast, other studies have found an increase of 5-to 10-fold in the severity of disease in human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus dual infections [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005] . The present study showed 12% of viral coinfections, and although no human metapneumovirus plus respiratory syncytial virus cases were detected, coinfected patients required longer recovery.",

Nonetheless, all samples were tested by either L and F genes RT-PCR, so it was considered that during the follow-up only human metapneumovirus subtype A2 circulated among patients included in this study. Interestingly, in a study undertaken during the same year based on 171 children with upper respiratory infection attended in different primary care centers of Catalonia, it was observed a cocirculation of both lineages among 10 human metapneumovirus identified (unpublished data). Recently, Huck et al. [2006] described a novel human metapneumovirus sublineage within A2 group, which they divided into A2a and A2b. In the present report, the sequences within the group A2 shared a nucleotide identity of 88.4%.
