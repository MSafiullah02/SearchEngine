One example was Amazon hidden artificial intelligence recruiting system, which was showing prejudice towards women resumes. The system was closed down in 2018 after facing harsh criticism from the public [1]. Gender equality is integral for a sustainable future and having equal rights and opportunities is an absolute necessity for women and girls. The United Nations has identified a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and gender equality (SDG 5) is one of them. Achieving equality by 2030 requires urgent action [2]. Gender equity refers to the fairness of treatment for both genders according to their needs [3]. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different; however, it is equivalent in terms of rights, obligations, and opportunities [3]. Gender equity is the means to achieving gender equality by correcting for the gender discriminations and biases that disproportionately affect one gender over the other, thus improving economic outcomes for all [4].",

However, these gaps are higher and widespread in health and social care sectors with around 26% in high-income countries and 29% in upper middle-income countries [7]. Furthermore, examples of gender gaps within global health include workplace violence and sexual harassment and often these issues are underreported or unreported due to social stigma or fear of retaliation. Although both men and women may face violence or sexual harassment, women are disproportionately the victims of such cases. Often female health workers face sexual harassment from their male colleagues, male patients, and/or members of their community [6]. Violence and harassment harms women by limiting their ability to do their job, forcing them to quit their jobs, lowering their morale, and causing them emotional as well as physical distress [7].",
