We have focused on a specific behavior, decisions to change travel to avoid areas affected by Zika, because of the extensive literature that travel contributes significantly to infectious disease emergence [16,17]. We have used a combination of content analysis and supervised machine learning techniques to understand first-person accounts of travel-related decisions during the Zika outbreak.

The first outbreaks occurred in 2007 in Gabon and the Federated States of Micronesia [19]. Furthermore, 6 years later, French Polynesia experienced the first large outbreak, and there was a documented association between neurological symptoms and Zika [19]. The subsequent emergence of Zika in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections [19-21]. Between 2015 and 2017, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported over half a million suspected Zika cases in South and Central America [22].",

As evidence mounted that there was a causal relationship, the World Health Organization (WHO) and PAHO issued alerts in December 2015 about the association between Zika, neurological syndromes, and birth defects. The United States responded to these alerts in mid-January 2016 by issuing a travel advisory for pregnant women, which cautioned against traveling to locations with local Zika transmission [21].

For example, genetic data from the 2009 H1N1 outbreak show that the movement of swine around Mexico was responsible for outbreaks in various provinces [27].

Furthermore, this is a common method used in other health surveillance work [9,51]. Twenty percent (400/2000) of the initial dataset was reserved for testing. This is a standard method used in machine learning to avoid overfitting models [52]. On the training data, we used a grid search to learn the best regularization parameter and feature set, using 5-fold cross-validation to measure the validation performance. For all classifiers, we tested features that included 1-, 2-, and 3-grams. Unigrams (1-grams) consistently outperformed longer n-grams or combinations of n-grams. We also experimented with feature selection using a chi-square test in an attempt to improve classifier metrics [53]. The best results were obtained when all features were used (first person and travel consideration) and when the top 70% of features were used (travel change; see Multimedia Appendix 2).

These tweets primarily discuss canceling travel to Singapore, which had started to identify local cases in late August 2016 [60].

Although these survey data exclude men, they do find evidence that women were aware of the disease and that some women (though not all) took measures like changing travel plans to avoid exposure to the disease.

The data are additionally biased in that data only includes tweets in English, which are predominately from the United States. However, we note that data from the United States are appropriate for studying travel behaviors because there was minimal Zika transmission in the United States, as the mosquito vector is absent in the majority of the country. As such, the main method of exposure was through travel to locations with local transmission. We believe our framework could be applied to other behaviors that are only applicable in places with local transmission, such as the use of mosquito repellent, but the classifiers would need to be trained in other languages such as Latin American Spanish.",

For example, Lau et al find that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic changed individuals' travel patterns [71], and substantial research has shown that beliefs and behaviors about vaccinations dramatically impact disease occurrence [72]. However, travel-related research data are currently sparse [41]. Although we cannot say that the findings from this research are generalizable, the fact that they exist on Twitter is evidence they do exist.
