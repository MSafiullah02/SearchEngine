This moment in history is so dramatic as to seem incomprehensible to some, to others a scene straight out of a disaster movie. Those of us who have devoted our lives to understanding and combatting illness know that science is the key to halting this disaster, but we are also aware of the fact that the shape of the world we live will be strikingly altered by this pandemic.",

With this in mind, I would like to personally thank Prof. Andrea Giustina, former editor-in-chief of Endocrine and current President of the European Society of Endocrinology, for asking us to publish the Society\u2019s statement on the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement appears in this issue of Endocrine [1], and we are convinced it will be of service to our community of readers. It offers a broad range of expert advice on counseling, monitoring, and treating patients with diabetes and endocrine disorders during this difficult time, regardless of whether or not they have COVID-19. I am sure that it will prove to be a valuable resource for all of you.",

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the journal\u2019s associate editors, who continue to carry out their responsibilities with dedication and punctuality despite significant demands from their own institutions and daily routines. And our efforts would be in vain without the support of the dedicated staff at Springer Nature and the experience and ability of Lisa Hussey, the journal\u2019s Publishing Editor.",
