            "text": "The host immune system is composed of multiple tissues, cells and molecules and can protect hosts from infectious diseases by recognizing and eliminating pathogens efficiently. In one example, our studies of mice infected with SARS-CoV showed that the severity of SARS correlated with the ability to develop a virus-specific immune response, while inhibitory alveolar macrophages and inefficient activation of dendritic cells (DCs) delayed this process and aggravated disease [1]. In another study, Channappanavar et al. further demonstrated that dysregulated type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory monocyte-macrophage responses led to lethal pneumonia in SARS-CoV-infected mice [2]. In support of these data, inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB)-mediated inflammation in SARS-CoV-infected mice increased survival [3]. Similar to their pathological roles in coronavirus infections, inappropriate or dysfunctional immune responses such as overactivation of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), have been implicated in host tissue destruction [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and persistent pathological changes in IAV-infected hosts [9]. Expression of the complex of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily 10 (TNFSF10), histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and HDAC5 negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and increases in their expression was correlated with improved prognosis of IAV-infected hosts [10]. In addition to their cell-intrinsic properties, lung macrophage and monocyte heterogeneity in localization in IAV infections also contributed to differences in outcomes [11].",

The contribution of innate immunity to immune defense is not limited in direct anti-viral effects [34]. Innate immune signals such as IFN-I not only interact with other innate immune elements such as monocytes and type-II IFN to limit IAV-caused tissue inflammation [35], but also directly modulated the adaptive immune response. Both IFN-I and toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) were also found to shape B cell-mediated immune responses against IAV [36], while RIG-I signaling was critical for efficient polyfunctional T cell responses [37]. Moreover, the increased mortality of IAV-infected mice in the absence of mitochondrial antiviral signaling (Mavs) and TLR7 was found to independent of viral load or myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88)-dependent signaling but dependent on secondary bacterial burden, caspase-1/11, and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage [38\u2022\u2022].",

In other reports, pulmonary endothelial cells [40], lung microvascular endothelial cells [41], neutrophils [42], eosinophils [43], lung mast cells [44], plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and invariant natural killer cells (iNKT) [45] were all identified as therapeutic targets in severe IAV and CoV infections.

To clarify the roles of these molecules and processes in virus infection, host genetic determinant screening [70, 71, 72], immunomics and Public Health Omics [73], host lipid omics [74\u2022\u2022] and characterization of the epigenetic landscape [75] were used to supplement conventional analyses. Moreover, information about interaction between immune and parenchymal cells also facilitated efforts to optimize antiviral response while reducing unwanted side effects [76\u2022, 77\u2022]. Computer modeling of host-pathogen interactions is likely to be used more in the future, as additional parameters are identified. Thus, computer modeling helped in prediction of clinical outcomes, demonstrating key roles for the innate immune response and the interval between infections [78]. These novel methodologies are likely to provide additional approaches to identifying targets for novel antiviral therapies.",

Recently, NS1 was also found to bind cellular dsDNA and prevent the loading of transcriptional machinery onto the DNA, thus attenuating expression of antiviral genes [82]. Meanwhile, the C-terminal domain of NS1 blocked IFN-beta production by targeting TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF-3) [83], while other domains of the protein inhibited interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) [84] and RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activation [85]. Another IAV protein, neuraminidase (NA), was shown to remove sialic acid residues from NKp46, resulting in reduced recognition of HA and enhancing immune evasion of NK cells [86]. In addition, the IAV M2 protein was shown to reverse bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2)-mediated restriction of virus release via proteasomal pathways [87]. To evade the host immune system, IAV also inhibits host but not viral mRNA nuclear export [88], without impairing nuclear viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) import [89]. In addition, productive viral replication in macrophages resulted in decreased phagocytosis via downregulation of Fc receptors CD16 and CD32, potentially playing a role in IAV pathogenesis [90].",

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2), critical for expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is often activated in endocytic compartments by RNA and DNA viruses, exacerbating virus-mediated pathogenicity [104\u2022]. In addition to important roles for host proteins [105], the role of lipids [74\u2022\u2022] in respiratory virus infections has also drawn increasing attention. Zhao et al. reported that age-related increases in prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) expression in mouse lungs correlated with a progressive impairment in DC migration to DLNs, causing diminished T cell responses upon IAV or SARS-CoV infection [106]. In a subsequent study, Vijay et al. demonstrated a critical role for phospholipase A2 group IID (PLA2G2D) in impaired DC migration to DLN and age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection [107]. PLA2G2D is upstream of PGD2 in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway. Both molecules may be useful targets for anti-viral therapies.",

On the other hand, IAV induced host histone deacetylase 1 dysregulation in lung epithelial cells, inhibiting IAV infection [111] while NEDDylation (conjugation of a ubiquitin-like protein, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8)) of PB2 protein reduced its stability, suppressing IAV replication [112].

Distinct from conventional adjuvants, novel reagents are being used to shape as well as augment the strength of the induced immune responses. Targeting IAV HA to the chemokine receptor, Xcr1, present on some dendritic cells enhanced protective antibody responses against the virus [124]. In addition, knowledge of the microbiota [125], and manipulation of apoptosis [126] and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) [127]-related signaling pathways have been used to predict or modulate responsiveness and efficiency of vaccines, respectively. A major goal of IAV and CoV vaccine development is to develop vaccines able to induce broadly acting antibodies; these efforts require more precise definition of useful conserved protective antibody epitopes [128]. Further, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) [129] dominated the activation of CD8+ T cells at late times after infection of C57BL/6 mice, triggering a switch in immunodominance from PA to NP-specificity. This differential expression of T cell epitopes has implications for DC-based vaccine design. Additionally, neutrophil-targeting [42] and Th1-targeting strategies [130] might help in establishing tissue-resident memory (TRM) and heterosubtypic immunity.",

Recent technical advances have facilitated distinguishing tissue-resident cell populations from those in the periphery. In a recent publication, airway memory CD4(+) T cells induced by a single conserved N protein-specific epitope present in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV mediated protection against challenge with either pathogen [131\u2022]. IAV-specific resident memory CD8 cells in the upper respiratory tract or bronchoalveolar fluid provided superior protection compared to those in the lung, although some studies questioned whether these were truly resident memory as opposed to memory cells at these sites [132]. In a recent report, Slutter et al. delineated the dynamics of IAV-induced lung-resident memory T cells that underlies waning heterosubtypic immunity [133], illustrating the tight collaboration of resident and peripheral T cell memory in respiratory virus control. In the future, use of sophisticated cell sorting methods and mass spectrometric flow cytometry will provide more precise information about resident memory immune cells.",
