However, analyses of the pooled North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and European Carotid Surgery Trial data have shown that the benefit of surgery is considerable reduced when patients are treated more than 2 weeks after the presenting symptoms.3\n",

Within the CAS group, 2 postprocedural hemorrhagic stroke events occurred (4.5%). One patient experienced intracerebral hemorrhage within 90 days of treatment.

The second patient had had symptoms of a transient ischemic attack on the ward, with no new ischemic damage found on a computed tomography scan but an unexpected asymptomatic thalamic hemorrhage under triple anticoagulation regimen.
