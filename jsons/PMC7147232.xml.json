The novel anti-viral drug GS-441524 injection stings and some cat guardians struggle to give it. In that case, if a veterinary nurse can do a daily home visit to give the treatment that would be preferable to a clinic visit.",

In this author\u2019s opinion, guardians of all pedigree cats should routinely be offered a FCoV antibody or faecal reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test pre-neutering: pedigree cats under two years old make up the majority of cats with FIP (Pesteanu-Somogyi, Radzai, & Pressler, 2006; Norris et al., 2005; Riemer et al., 2016; Soma, Wada, Taharaguchi, & Tajima, 2013; Tsai, Chueh, Lin, & Su, 2011; Worthing et al., 2012). Be sure to use a test with very good sensitivity to avoid a false negative result (Addie, Le Poder, et al., 2015). Because many pedigree kittens will have antibodies to FCoV, if may be preferable to offer a pre-operation RT-PCR test to establish if a cat is actually shedding FCoV. FCoV RT-PCR tests are more expensive than antibody tests and need to be performed more than a week before the planned date of surgery (as the sample will need to be mailed to a reference laboratory), but as these would have to be done anyway if the antibody test were positive, it is perhaps a better option because it could save the cat a wasted trip to the surgery, as the guardian could bring in the faecal sample.",

Therefore, after the death of a cat to FIP, the litter tray can be disinfected using bleach, and soft furnishings can be steam-cleaned. To be 100% sure that all coronavirus has gone, wait 2 months before obtaining another cat. If there are already cats in the household who were in contact with the FIP cat, those cats should be tested for FCoV antibodies. It is important to use a sensitive test (i.e. one which doesn\u2019t give false negative results; for example the FCoV Immunocomb, Biogal, Israel (Addie, Boucraut-Baralon, et al., 2015)) and the new cat or kitten should only be introduced after the existing cats have become seronegative, which can take some months to occur. The FCoV infection status of the new cat or kitten should also be established. An alternative option to FCoV antibody testing is to offer FCoV RT-PCR testing of faecal samples, which has become widely available. The advantages of FCoV RT-PCR tests are that they are able to differentiate cats who are actually shedding virus from those who were previously infected and have a residual antibody signal. One disadvantage is cost, which is higher than for antibody tests, plus there is a delay in getting results back from a reference laboratory. An advantage of FCoV antibody testing over RT-PCR is that a single negative FCoV antibody test rules out FCoV infection (provided the test is sufficiently sensitive and the cat is over 10 weeks old), whereas several monthly faecal RT-PCR tests must be performed to be confident of a negative result (Addie & Jarrett, 2001). Where cat guardians are unable to reliably obtain faecal samples uncontaminated by the faeces of other cats in the household, viral RNA can also be detected on plain cotton rectal swabs (not in transport medium) performed by the veterinary surgeon or nurse.",

At time of writing, the best advice for people with cats in contact with a FIP case is to avoid stress as far as possible. Feline pheromone diffusers can be used in the home. Good nutrition is extremely important: cats are obligate carnivores; arginine is an essential amino acid for cats, which they can only obtain from real meat (Morris & Rogers, 1978). Arginine is essential for both the urea cycle and the proper functioning of the immune system.",

In the case of kittens, bear in mind that maternally derived antibodies to panleukopenia virus can persist until 20 weeks of age (Addie, Toth, Thompson, Greenwood, & Jarrett, 1998) and interfere with primary vaccination. The stress of a vaccine is not simply about the journey to the veterinary surgery and the procedure of giving an injection: the adjuvant contained within the vaccine is a major stressor to the immune system (Batista-Duharte, Portuondo, P\u00e9rez, & Carlos, 2014). If booster vaccination is essential, then use the least number of components possible, just core vaccines. For example, feline leukaemia (FeLV) vaccination is not core in countries such as the UK, where FeLV prevalence is under 1%, and in many cats\u2019 situations (e.g. indoor-only cats) (Lutz et al., 2009), but if it has to be given, then choose a non-adjuvanted vaccine, such as the recombinant canarypox FeLV vaccine (Purevax, Boehringer Ingelheim): such vaccines cause less inflammation and are likely safer in cats (Graf, Guscetti, Welle, Meier, & Pospischil, 2018).",

In addition, kittens get infected at an early age, before their immune systems are fully developed. Posters, such as the one shown in Figure 3, are available for educating the public about the dangers of buying a FCoV-infected pure-bred kitten. These posters can be downloaded, printed and put up in the practice waiting room (http://www.catvirus.com/Choosekitten.htm#Poster).
