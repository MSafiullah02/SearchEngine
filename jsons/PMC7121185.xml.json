Finally, what completely changed the history of infectious diseases was the emergence of the first cases of pneumocistosis at S. Francisco in 1981, and the subsequent discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that caused opportunistic infections (AIDS) in infected individuals. Other emerging infections occurred worldwide later on, including Hantavirus epidemic in United States in 1993, H5N1 influenza in China in 1993, Diphtheria in Eastern Europe in 1997 after the fall of the barriers from West and East Europe, SARS in Asia in 2003, etc. [5].",

Moreover, war events often stop or deteriorate ongoing infection prevention and control programs, both in the community and healthcare setting, including vaccination, medication supply, access to surgical and medical care, etc. [7]. Re-emergence of malaria by Plasmodium falciparum in Afghanistan, trypanosomiasis in Democratic Republic of Congo, AIDS, vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, all are dramatically affected by war events [7].Crowding: micro-organisms often require close contact for their direct or indirect transmission; this is valid both for community (SARS, MERS-CoV) and healthcare-associated infection. Crowding is a condition that can facilitate the transmission of potentially life-threatening infections because of the likelihood of reaching susceptible hosts and, as it is the case of patients in crowded healthcare facilities, for the easier probability to have limited/poor infection control measures and understaffing.Tourism, migration, asylum seekers, refugees, and all conditions for mobility. Travel can model infectious disease dynamics by introducing potential pathogens into susceptible populations or by modifying the rate of contacts and exposures between infected and susceptible individuals.Globalization and centralization of food production and supply, and new food vehicles: the case of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) clusters of cases caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 in Germany in 2016\u20132017 likely associated with packaged minced meat consumption is emblematic.Environmental modifications, with change in vector distribution and susceptibility.

In 1931, a sulfa drug, prontosil rubrum, was the first clinically useful antibacterial agent to be discovered. However, prontosil was not the first antibacterial agent to be invented, and humans were not the initial inventors. According to sophisticated genetic analysis, it is clear that bacteria invented antibiotics and consequently induced antibiotic resistance mechanisms somewhere between 2 and 2.5 billion years ago. Bacteria have been killing each other with these weapons, and using resistance mechanisms to protect themselves against these weapons, for 20 million times longer than we have even known that antibiotics exist [10]. This was surprisingly discovered in a deep cave explored in New Mexico in 2011, isolated from the surface of the planet for 4 million years, in which scientists cultured many different types of bacteria from the walls of the caves. Resistance to at least one modern antibiotic was found in many isolated organisms, and some of them were multidrug resistant, even to modern antibiotics [11].",

More recent pan-resistant strains, expressing also resistance to polymixins, have been identified as cause of severe diseases; some colistin-resistant strains had a chromosomal resistance, likely induced by antibiotic pressure, but in other cases colistin resistance was linked to mobile elements, plasmids, like MCR-1 and others. This emerging resistance represents an important concern due to its potential for spreading among bacteria of different species; as evidenced recently in China, environment is one of the main sources of these mobile elements, likely due to the wide use of colistin in agriculture [12].",

The burden of HAI is therefore alarming, with around 9 million infections yearly in acute care hospitals and 4.4 million in long-term care facilities. More than a quarter of HAIs were respiratory tract infections, mainly pneumonia, followed by urinary tract infections (18.9%), surgical site infections (18.4%), bloodstream infection (8.9%), and gastrointestinal infections (8.9%).

The overuse and misuse of antimicrobials both in the human and animal field, and their dispersion in the environment pose a risk for selection of mechanisms of resistance of germs.
