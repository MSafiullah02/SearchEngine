This approach involves integration of the gene of interest into the plant genome, and it has been used successfully to express a number of immunologically active proteins. An alternative to stable genetic transformation is the use of plant virus-based vectors to achieve expression. The main advantages of using the latter strategy are that viral genomes are small and easy to manipulate, infection of plants with modified viruses is simpler and quicker than the regeneration of stably transformed plants, and the sequence inserted into a virus vector will be highly amplified. However, there are some disadvantages: the foreign gene is not heritable, there are limitations on the size and complexity of the sequences that can be expressed in a genetically stable manner, and there are concerns about the ability of modified viruses to spread in the environment. Despite these difficulties, different plant virus vectors have been used for protein expression. In the present paper, we review the development of virus-based vectors as a potential source of novel vaccines in plants.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The first attempts to develop plant virus vectors involved viruses with DNA genomes. Unfortunately, the complexity of the replication cycles made these viruses unsuitable for the expression of high levels of foreign proteins in plants. To gain information about these DNA virus-based vectors, the reader is referred to Porta and Lomonossoff. 1, 2 The vast majority of plant viruses have genomes that consist of one or more molecules of positive-sense RNA. These viruses can grow in a wide range of hosts, and some can reach extremely high titres. The ability of the genomes of positive-sense RNA plant viruses to be directly translated on entering a plant cell has made this class of virus a very attractive choice to express recombinant proteins in infected plants. 3 With the development of methods that permit the manipulation of infectious cDNA clones of positive-strand RNA viruses, 4 the exploitation of these viruses as vectors for foreign protein expression began. Since then, members of several virus families have been developed as useful vectors (Fig. 1 ). The first strategy used for developing virus vectors was to replace existing nonessential viral genes with foreign genes. However, this replacement strategy has limitations, due to adverse consequences associated with gene deletion. A more successful approach has been to insert the foreign gene as an addition to the virus genome, avoiding the deletion of any viral genes. For reviews on the development of RNA virus-based vectors, the reader is referred to Scholthof et al . 5 and Porta and Lomonossoff. 2, 6 Two basic types of expression system based on RNA plant viruses have been developed for the production of immunogenic peptides and proteins in plants. In the first type, termed epitope presentation systems, the viral vector is designed so that short antigenic peptides fused to the coat protein (CP) are displayed on the surface of assembled viral particles. These modified virions or chimeras are attractive as potential novel vaccines, because the modified particles can be readily purified and the presentation of multiple copies of an antigenic peptide on the surface of a macromolecular assembly can significantly increase its immunogenicity. 7 The second type, often referred to as polypeptide expression systems, express a whole unfused recombinant protein that accumulates within the plant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 344, "text": "Porta and Lomonossoff. 1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 345, "end": 346, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 767, "end": 768, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1546, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1576, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1578, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2227, "end": 2228, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1057, "end": 1064, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Types of viral expression system"}, {"text": "In this expression strategy, the sites of insertion are chosen so that the peptide is displayed on the surface of the virus particles without interfering with the ability of the modified CP to assemble.

Given the state of knowledge of the structure of its particles, the availability of infectious cDNA clones and the potential productivity of the system, CPMV was an attractive candidate for development as an epitope presentation system. Analysis of the 3-D structure of CPMV identified exposed loops on the virus surface that would potentially be suitable sites for the insertion of foreign sequences. 10 In most cases, the foreign sequence has been inserted into the most exposed loop on the virus surface, the \u03b2 B-\u03b2 C loop of the S protein. 8, 9 However, other sites, such as the \u03b2 E-\u03b1 B loop of the L protein and the \u03b2 C \u2032 -\u03b2 C \u2033 loop of the S protein, have also been used successfully.

The reader is referred to Lomonossoff and Hamilton, 15 where the results of these immunological studies have been reviewed. The ability of modified plant virus particles to stimulate protective immunity, the ultimate goal of vaccine development, was first reported in 1997. 16 This study involved a CPMV chimera (CPMV-PARVO1) that contained a 17 amino acid epitope from the N-terminal region of the VP2 capsid protein of canine parvovirus. This peptide is also found in VP2 of related canine parvoviruses (CPV), mink enteritis virus (MEV), and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). This CPMV-PARVO1 chimera in an active and a UV light-inactivated form were shown to be capable of protecting mink and dogs against MEV and CPV, respectively. 16,17 CPMV-based chimeras expressing epitopes of a bacterial origin were subsequently shown to also be able to confer protective immunity 18, 19 ( Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 401, "end": 403, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 623, "end": 625, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1226, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1229, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1232, "end": 1240, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Cowpea mosaic virus"}, {"text": "Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) particles consist of a single molecule of genomic RNA encapsidated by 2130 copies of a single type of CP arranged with helical symmetry. The fact that TMV particles contain a large number of subunits, making the system potentially very attractive for peptide expression, is also a problem in that the subunits are very tightly packed, allowing little space on the virus surface for the expression of foreign sequences. Attempts to develop TMV as an epitope presentation system initially resulted in the production of CP subunits that were unable to assemble into virus particles. By engineering a leaky termination codon at the C-terminus of the CP gene, a TMV vector was developed that permitted the synthesis of both native and recombinant forms of the CP from the same viral RNA. 20 As with CPMV-based chimeras, the inserted peptides could be detected on the surface of assembled virions, being used to express epitopes of several animal pathogens. 21, 22 Subsequently, by modifying the site of peptide insertion between amino acids 154 and 155, near but not at the C-terminus of the CP, it has been possible to develop a TMV-based vector in which all of the CP subunits could be modified to express foreign peptides abolishing virus viability. 23 The size of inserts that can be tolerated even at this optimized position seems to be quite small, the largest reported to date being 23 amino acids in a chimera that grew substantially more slowly than wild-type TMV. 24 The first analysis of the immunogenicity of a TMV chimera involved a construct expressing 13 amino acids from the glycoprotein ZP3 from the murine zona pellucida 23 (Table 1) . Using the vector developed by Fitchen et al ., 23 Koo et al . 25 were able to produce chimeric TMV particles presenting an epitope from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Mice immunized with purified virions produced antibodies against the MHV epitope, and those with high antibody titres were protected against challenge with the virus. Recently, using the same strategy, two epitopes from foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) were expressed on TMV. 26 As reported previously with CPMV, 18 expression of an epitope from the OM protein F of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the surface of TMV 27 has been shown to confer protective immunity against P. aeruginosa . In the same way, a mixture of a TMV chimera and a chimeric influenza virus presenting two different epitopes from protein F of P. aeruginosa conferred immunity in mice. 28 To overcome the limitation on the size of peptide that can be fused to the TMV CP, researchers have developed a system where an appropriately modified version of the alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) CP is expressed from an additional copy of the TMV CP subgenomic promoter. Using this approach, a 40 amino acid sequence containing epitopes from rabies virus and a 47 amino acid sequence from HIV-1 were fused to the AlMV CP. 29 Both types of particle elicited the production of appropriate virus-neutralizing antibodies; those displaying the rabies virus epitopes were able to protect mice against a normally lethal challenge with the virus. 30 Using a similar approach, a fusion protein consisting of a potentially neutralizing epitope from hepatitis C virus linked to the C-terminus of the cholera toxin B subunit has been expressed from TMV. 31 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 810, "end": 812, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 979, "end": 982, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 983, "end": 985, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1277, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1498, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1725, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1740, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2120, "end": 2122, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2159, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2496, "end": 2498, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2919, "end": 2921, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3136, "end": 3138, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3339, "end": 3341, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1664, "end": 1673, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Tobacco mosaic virus"}, {"text": "Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is a monopartite virus, particles of which contain 180 copies of a single type of CP arranged with icosahedral symmetry.

Particularly encouraging is the fact that it is now clear that peptides or proteins expressed in this manner can confer protective immunity against a number of diseases (Tables 1,2 ), in some cases in the target animals. 16, 17, 57 In most of these cases, immunity was stimulated by parenteral immunization, but there are encouraging signs that mucosal immunization may be possible. 25, 29, 62 This raises the prospect that it may be possible to confer protective immunity by simply feeding with plant material infected with an appropriate virus construct. To achieve this, it will be necessary not only to express peptides or proteins that can stimulate mucosal immunity but also to express the material in edible plants. In this regard, the continued development of vectors that can infect edible plants -such as those based on (i) CPMV, 61 clover yellow vein virus (CIYVV) 63 and pea early browning virus (PEBV), 64 all of which infect legumes; (ii) wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), 65 which infects cereals; and (iii) zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), 66 which infects cucurbits -is likely to play a prominent role.

Even if direct feeding is shown to be efficacious, there will still be a need to purify, at least partially, proteins and chimeric particles for certain applications.

To this end, results reported on the large-scale growth and purification of a TMV chimera expressing a 12 amino acid malarial peptide 69 show that although growth under field conditions gives a lower yield per gram (fresh weight) of tissue than growth in a greenhouse, an excess of 1 kg per acre of purified particles could potentially be obtained. Similarly, it has been shown that large quantities (up to 10 mg per gram, fresh weight) of wild-type CPMV could be extracted from fresh or frozen cowpea leaves by methods suitable for large-scale application. 70 The development of methods for the industrial-scale production of plant-derived vaccines will make an important contribution to the practical use of such material.
