In fact, the controversy of early studies regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, vaginal fluid and feces of infected individuals has not ruled out the possibility of sexual transmission [5], [6], [7], [8]. The most recent study evaluating 38 male subjects in the acute phase of COVID-19 has demonstrated that 15% of participants had positive tests in the semen 7. These uncertainties might have eventually led to an increased search for sexual medicine professionals. Sexual avoidance and decreased intimacy can also be the trigger for the onset of sexual dysfunction in the couple. Fortunately, the International Society of Sexual Medicine has released a document pertaining the safety of sexual encounters during the pandemic that might help guiding professionals and patients 9.",

Interestingly, working in both public and private institutions simultaneously is not only allowed but also very common. Particularly in the field of sexual medicine, most of the installed infrastructure is found within the private sector and most often in a fee-for-service fashion. Therefore, the economic recession together with worrying predictions has the potential to undermine both patient accessibility to sexual medicine services and the income of many professionals. As it is not possible to predict when routine sexual medicine practice will return, the financial impact on many sexual health care providers can be dramatic. On the other hand, public services have been mostly devoted to the fight against COVID-19, and many sexual medicine experts who are public employees have been allocated to work in the frontline or in regulation services. The reality is that many public sexual medicine referral centers have been closed down, in which all consultations and surgeries were cancelled and there is still no forecast for their normalization. The longer this situation lasts the bigger will be the delay in these elective procedures, overloading the public system.",

As a result, there has been an urgent need for the development of new regulations and a rapid implementation nationwide. However, patients, providers and insurance companies have not easily accepted this process, which will probably need more time to adapt. Providers are reluctant because many insurance companies are not paying for online consultations. Some advocate that the use of telemedicine through expensive platforms may impair the practice of local physicians, leaving its management in the hands of wealthy institutions. Also, being a country where Latin culture predominates, patients tend to prefer the traditional face-to-face contact and a closer relationship to their caregivers. Online consultations have been refused by some patients on the grounds that they might undermine the emotional bond to the interviewing professional. Others have complaint about the lack of privacy during remote consultations. As many families are isolated together, some individuals are afraid that the conversation might be overheard exposing sensitive issues such as masturbation habits, multiple sexual partners, bizarre sexual practices, to name a few.",

At home visits for diagnostic workup are expensive and unfortunately beyond the financial reality of the vast majority of our population. Taken together, this scenario imposes a great risk for treatment discontinuation or suboptimal care. Managing complicated surgical cases has also been difficult. For instance, there are reports of patients who had prolonged hospital stay or even death after SARS-CoV-2 following uneventful surgical procedures 10. To avoid exposing the team, patients and family members to these risks, surgeons may feel pressured to undergo more conservative measures and delay necessary in-hospital interventions.",

Its use could gradually become routine with better acceptance from patients and providers. It is even likely that new technologies might create strategies to overcome the lack of physical contact in the future. As a result, many patients could benefit from having access to sexual medicine experts without the need to dislocate long distances, which is particularly relevant in our country with continental dimensions and limited offer of specialized professionals. As interviews are the main core of sexual medicine practice, telemedicine might be more easily applied within our specialty. In addition, other professionals such as psychologists and nutritionists have been allowed to perform online consultations for years, and their successful experience in our country could be a model for sexual medicine to build on.",
