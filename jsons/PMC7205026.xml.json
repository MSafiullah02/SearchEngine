            "text": "An outbreak of unknown causes of pneumonia cases was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, with clinical presentations similar to viral pneumonia [1]. Genomic analysis on the RNA samples extracted from the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid of the pneumonia patients by Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing identified the viral contigs matched to the genome of lineage B of the genus betacoronavirus and with 85% identity to the genome of a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1) [2], indicating that this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-resembled virus (SARS-CoV-2). Target cell infection by SARS-CoV is mediated by the spike protein of coronavirus and the host cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3]. Similarly, a recent study suggests that the cellular entry by SARS-CoV-2 also depends on ACE2 as well as type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) [4]. This implies that the identification of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in human tissues can predict the potential infected cells and their respective influences in COVID-19 patients.",

In contrast, conjunctivitis was suggested as a pre-symptomatic sign before the onset of COVID-19, possibly by the exposure of infectious droplets without proper protection of goggles [7]. Critically, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in tears and conjunctival secretions from a COVID-19 patient with conjunctivitis by RT-PCR [8]. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 could infect human conjunctival cells and cause conjunctivitis still remain elusive. Herein, this study aimed to determine the expressions of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 genes in human and mouse ocular cells and tissues. Their expressions were also compared with the expressions in other tissue cells.",

Human primary conjunctival and pterygium cell lines have been established and characterized as previously described [9, 10]. Briefly, full-length primary pterygium and conjunctiva tissues, freshly collected from surgical removal, were first digested with 50 \u03bcg/ml dispase (Gibco\u00ae, Rockville, MD) and 100 mM D-sorbitol (Sigma-Aldrich) in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco\u00ae) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and further dissociated into single cells by 0.05% trypsin at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min with the cell strainer (40 \u03bcm, NuncTM). The isolated cells were cultured in advanced DMEM medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco\u00ae) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco\u00ae) in 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. The medium was changed in every 2\u20133 days. The conjunctival cells and pterygium cells with passage 3 were used in this study.",

SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered as the pathogenic cause of COVID-19 [2]. It is believed that person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 is mainly due to the infection by SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and close contact [20]. The infection and cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 are mediated by the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus and the host cellular SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 [4, 21]. In addition to ACE2, TMPRSS2 is required to promote SARS-CoV entry by ACE2 cleavage to promote viral uptake and SARS-CoV spike protein cleavage to activates the spike protein for membrane fusion [22]. Therefore, understanding the coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 can predict the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human system.",

Similarly, consistent expression of TMPRSS2 gene could only be found in 1 out of 3 investigated pterygium samples, but not in any conjunctival cells (Fig. 1b). Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the contrary, consistent expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes can be found in endothelial cells HUVEC, epidermal keratinocytes HaCaT, and lung epithelial carcinoma cells A549, indicating that lung, skin, and blood capillaries are the potential sites with SARS-CoV-2 infection. To expand our understanding of the possible tissues influenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we determined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes in mouse tissues (Fig. 3). We report the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes in mouse cornea tissue, but not in iris, lens, retina, and optic nerve. Our results indicated that cornea could be a susceptible site for SARS-CoV-2 infection as their expressions in cornea are comparable to that in lung tissue (Fig. 4). Apart from cornea, we found expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes in lung, liver, kidney, and brain. A recent RNA sequencing analysis on 13 human tissues reports the expression of ACE2 mainly in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, oesophagus keratinocytes, ileum enterocytes, rectum enterocytes, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules, and ACE2 expression was also observed in pericytes and fibroblasts from the eye tissue [23]. ACE2 expression can also be noted in the epithelial cells of oral mucosa, vascular endothelial cells, type II pneumocytes, kidney, heart, and the central nervous system [24\u201328]. On the other hand, TMPRSS2 expression has been reported in primary human airway cells, type II pneumocytes and cancers [29, 30].",

Activation of endogenous Ace2 by diminazene aceturate facilitates the drainage of aqueous humor and decreases intraocular pressure in a rat model of glaucoma [34]. Overexpression of ACE2 can also ameliorate the inflammatory response in experimental autoimmune uveitis model and amyloid \u03b2-treated human RPE [35, 36]. Although ACE2 is critical for SARS-CoV infection, SARS-CoV infection and spike protein of SARS-CoV would reduce ACE2 expression, and injection of SARS-CoV spike protein worsens acute lung failure in mice with the enhanced renin-angiotensin pathway [37]. Considering the correlation of reduced ACE2 expression after SARS-CoV infection and the anti-inflammatory role of ACE2, it could explain the possible occurrence of conjunctivitis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [7, 8].",
