The conventional microbiological techniques, such as culture, serology, antigen detection, have practical challenges, notably, complex technology, poor sensitivity and prolonged turnaround time. Since the advent of PCR, the advances in these new molecular techniques have shown their applicability to improve the detection of agents causing various types of infections. The multiplex PCR method allows the potential amplification of many nucleic acid targets within a single reaction and has proven to be an attractive diagnostic method for multi-pathogen detection in respiratory tract infections [9], [10].",

Of note, the adjudication committee based its judgement not only on follow-up data, but also on systematic day 0 thoracic CT scan, which is unique. The value of 35% PCR-positive patients with definite CAP is in agreement with several studies without an adjudication committee, which reported detection of viruses in a substantial proportion of patients with CAP. Jennings et al. and Johansson et al. both reported a viral diagnosis in 29% of hospitalized adult patients with CAP of similar age group (61\u201370 years) by PCR, whereas Liu et al. detected 36% viruses in adult outpatients with CAP and Templeton et al. detected viruses in 56% of adult patients from outpatient and inpatient departments, of whom half of the patients were <60 years old [2], [3], [4], [13]. The most frequently detected viruses in our study were influenza A/B virus and rhinoviruses, as reported in previous studies [14]. Like our study, these reports addressed patients with an approximately similar rate, 28\u201332%, of coexisting conditions. Paediatric studies identified viral infections by real-time PCR in 28% of hospitalized patients, increasing to 50% in those with asthma [14], [15]. The frequency and distribution of viruses detected were slightly different in two recent studies of patients in intensive care units and of elderly adults with moderate to severe illness [16], [17]. These differences may partly be due to differences in viruses circulating in the community during the study period or to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic technology used. The seasonal distribution of detected pathogens in our study was similar to that observed in the community French surveillance network of patients with influenza-like illness in 2012\u20132013 (V Enouf, Institut Pasteur, personal communication). All of these findings confirm the major changes induced by molecular techniques in describing CAP-associated microorganisms; in comparison, a review of 26 prospective studies in ten European countries (approximately 6000 patients), published in 1998 before the wide use of PCR, found respiratory viruses accounted for only 8% of patients with CAP [18].",

The fact that NP samples are only a proxy of the infectious agents present deeper in the lung has to be considered. Whether lower respiratory samples would have facilitated imputability and given fewer negative results has to be studied in patients with more severe conditions that allow for invasive diagnostic investigations [16]. It is important to admit that multiplex PCR may have different analytical sensitivities for different viruses, which would affect the diagnostic yield. It is interesting to underline that the eight patients with PCR-detected M. pneumoniae had definite CAP, reinforcing the interest of this test in the context of M. pneumoniae epidemics.",

In our study, the higher proportion of rhinoviruses in patients with excluded CAP suggests that at least part of these rhinoviruses were either viral shedding or could be associated with limited upper respiratory tract infection, as suggested previously in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults [20], [21], [22]. The seasonal distribution of influenza A/B virus detection and the similar proportion in excluded and non-excluded CAP suggest that pneumonia is not the primary manifestation of influenza, as already known [23]. Another hypothesis for this high rate of positive PCR in excluded CAP may be that some patients with minimal or early lesions of CAP could present with a normal CT scan, as has been known for a long time for chest X-rays.",

            "text": "The epidemiology of CAP in adults has probably changed in recent years because of the indirect impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children [24]. However, establishing the aetiology of CAP remains difficult and the imputability of pathogens detected in the upper respiratory tract remains questionable. As in the present study, no cause is determined in half or more of the patients. Even considering the limit related to the routine non-standardized sampling for bacterial investigations in the study, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly identified bacteria associated with CAP, as is generally recognized. The rate of detection of other bacteria, and atypical agents was similar to that reported in a recent review [24]. Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, are commonly detected in patients with CAP as described here [14]. However, it remains challenging to differentiate viral CAP from mixed-infection or bacterial CAP. It is a hypothesis that the increasing recognition (15\u201354%) of viruses as a cause of CAP in adults may reflect advances in viral detection by PCR-based testing. Better ways to diagnose viral CAP would increase the use of targeted antiviral therapies. Specifically, detection of influenza virus should lead to consideration of antiviral therapy within the 48 h after onset of symptoms, which has been shown to improve prognosis [23]. It can be useful to establish the virological diagnosis for epidemiological purposes in hospitalized patients who may require infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission, especially in the case of a new and/or contagious virus outbreak, such as the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak [25]. Whether the rapid viral diagnosis is likely to change individual antibiotic management and reduce antibiotic overuse has to be studied [24], [26]. Nevertheless, the relatively low sensitivity of the test and the high cost issues need to be addressed before widespread use of the multiplex PCR method.",
