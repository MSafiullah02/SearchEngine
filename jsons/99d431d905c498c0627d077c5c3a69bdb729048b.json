While not as well studied in the natural reservoirs, the pro-inflammatory response and viral replication appear controlled and show no obvious pathology. In contrast, infection in humans results in an initial high viral load marked by an aggressive pro-inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm. The key difference in the course of the infection between the reservoir and human host is the inflammatory response. In this investigation, we apply a simple two-component differential equation model for proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses and a detailed mathematical analysis to identify specific regions in parameter space for single stable endemic equilibrium, bistability or periodic solutions. The extensions of the deterministic model to two stochastic models account for variability in responses seen at the cell (local) or tissue (global) levels. Numerical solutions of the stochastic models exhibit outcomes that are typical of a chronic infection in the natural reservoir or a cytokine storm in human infection. In the chronic infection, occasional flare-ups between high and low responses occur when model parameters are in a region of bistability or periodic solutions. The cytokine storm with a vigorous pro-inflammatory response and less vigorous anti-inflammatory response occurs in the parameter region for a single stable endemic equilibrium with a strong pro-inflammatory response.

The major goal of this investigation is to propose a simple modelling framework with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines to account for the differences between the natural reservoir, where the interaction between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines maintains a low level of cytokines (characteristic of a chronic but mild persistent infection) and the human host, where a vigorous pro-inflammatory response leads to a cytokine storm. In addition, various models illustrate that alternative pathways of the innate immune response may lead to similar outcomes. We apply a model formulated by Baker et al.

Hereafter, this model is referred to as the Baker model. This twocompartment model is a non-mechanistic approximation to the real system. This simple model with just a few parameters enables us to understand some basic interactions between the cytokines. The mechanisms responsible for the cytokine storm are much more complex. With time series data from carefully designed laboratory experiments, specific pathways and genes/proteins associated with proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses can be identified and used to test some of the outcomes of this simple model.

The underlying ODE model exhibits a broad range of behaviours from low to high-stable cytokine levels, bistable states, oscillations and relapse-remission flare-ups. Regions in parameter space are associated with upregulation of either pro-and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines. The bifurcation analysis is carried out through symbolic computation.

Setting the left-hand side of (2.3) to 0, we obtain equilibrium solutions (p,\u0101) of model (2.3), wher\u0113andp satisfies the following equation:The bifurcation dynamics depend on the local stability of the equilibria, (p,\u0101), since stable (unstable) equilibria attract (repel) nearby solutions. The corresponding eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of system (2.3) determine the stability of equilibria and are obtained from the roots of the characteristic polynomial \u03bb 2 \u2212 Trace (J) \u03bb + Det (J) = 0, whereThe stability of an equilibrium changes when the system undergoes a bifurcation. An SN bifurcation occurs when Det . For a dynamical system undergoing bifurcation, a small perturbation or uncertainty in parameter values can cause a dramatic change in model behaviour. Therefore, bifurcation curves in terms of parameter values form the boundaries for different model behaviours.The value of m i , i = 1, 2, 3 is related to the number of binding sites on the surface of cytokinesecreting cells. Generally, larger values of m i give rise to richer dynamical behaviour of models (2.1, 2.3). Two static bifurcations usually give rise to bistability. Hopf bifurcation plays an important role as a source for oscillations. Therefore, we investigate the necessary condition for a Hopf bifurcation. Considering F (p) = 0 of (A.1) into Trace (J) = 0 in (A.2), we have. Therefore, Hill coefficients are set as the smallest integers which give rise to rich dynamical behaviours that is m i = 2, i = 1, 2, 3. Moreover, since Hopf bifurcation is a codimension-one bifurcation, the dynamical behaviour of the model can fully unfold with the variance of one-parameter value. In this study, we concentrate on investigating how the extra pro-inflammatory cytokinesecreting rate, \u03b1 2 , causes cytokine storm in virus infections. Therefore, \u03b1 2 is chosen as a bifurcation parameter. The bifurcation curves (the corresponding equilibrium undergoes one specific bifurcation when parameter values locate on one of these curves) are determined by The bifurcation analysis shows that an SN bifurcation occurs if Det 1 p; \u03b3 , \u03b1 2 = 0 in (A.7); Hopf bifurcation occurs if Trace 1 p; \u03b3 , \u03b1 2 = 0 in (A.6) and Det 1 p; \u03b3 , \u03b1 2 > 0. In (A.7) and (A.6),p satisfies equation F 1 p; \u03b3 , \u03b1 2 = 0 in (A.5). (A.7) and (A.6) give the SN and Hopf bifurcation curves, denoted as SN 1 , SN 2 and Hopf in Fig. 1 . These bifurcation curves divide the \u03b1 2 -\u03b3 parameter space in Fig. 1 Here, \u03b3 hm = 1.2765 denotes the minimum \u03b3 value for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation, and \u03b3 BT = 1.2845 denotes BT bifurcation critical point. Moreover, according to (A.4), the necessary condition of a Hopf bifurcation for m 1 = 2 is \u03b3 > 1. Therefore, in region (i), a Hopf bifurcation does not occur in the entire parameter space; while in region (ii), Hopf bifurcation does not occur in the current parameter set, but there is the possibility in other parameter sets, investigated in the next subsection. Region (iii) is a transition case. Model (2.3) exhibits oscillations in a slim window of \u03b1 2 -values, sandwiched between two Hopf bifurcations. The eigenvalues of one of the two Hopf bifurcations become a pair of real numbers with opposite signs in region (iv). There is a large interval for \u03b1 2 values where model (2.3) exhibits oscillations. In Fig. 4(a) , an SN bifurcation occurs if Det 2 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 = 0 in (A.10); a Hopf bifurcation occurs if Trace 2 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 = 0 in (A.9) with Det 2 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 > 0 in (A.10). The SN and Hopf bifurcation conditions give the corresponding curves as SN 1 , SN 2 , Hopf 1 and Hopf 2 in Fig. 4. Model (2.3) shows bistability in the dotted region delimited by two bifurcation curves, SN 1 and SN 2 and oscillation in the grey region delimited by two Hopf bifurcation curves, Hopf 1 and Hopf 2 . Further, 1D bifurcation analysis is carried out for three \u03b1 4 values taken at 3, 8 and 28. The corresponding bifurcation diagrams are plotted in Fig. 4(b-d) , respectively. The 1D bifurcation analysis shows that with the increase of the value of \u03b1 4 , the bistable \u03b1 2 interval between SN 1 and SN 2 shrinks down until it disappears in the case of \u03b1 2 = 28 in Fig. 4(d) . The middle branch unstable equilibrium is a saddle and serves as a boundary for bistability.In the top branch equilibrium, with an increase in \u03b1 4 , a Hopf bifurcation appears; the distance between the two Hopf bifurcations enlarges and the unstable equilibrium is enclosed by a stable periodic solution. If the lower branch equilibrium exists, it is a stable node. 292 W. ZHANG ET AL.A.3 Parameter \u03b1 4 vs. \u03b1 2 for large \u03b3 Setting \u03b1 1 = 0.025 and \u03b3 = 1.5 yieldsThe Trace (J) = 0 and Det (J) = 0 in (A.2) considering the equilibrium condition a =\u0101 (p) give Bifurcation analysis gives a Hopf bifurcation curve and SN bifurcation curves, denoted as Hopf, SN 1 and SN 2 in Fig. 5(a) , according to Det 3 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 = 0 in (A.13) and Trace 3 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 = 0 in (A.12) with Det 3 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 > 0, respectively. Herep satisfies equation F 3 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 = 0 in (A.11). The points where the Hopf bifurcation curve is tangent to a SN bifurcation curve give rise to two BT bifurcations at \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 = (17.8016, 15.8314) and \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 4 = (5.7757, 1.5577).A.4 Parameter \u03b1 1 vs. \u03b1 2 Setting \u03b1 4 = 12, and \u03b3 = 1.5, we have F 4 p; \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 1 =p 7 + \u03b1 1 + \u03b1 2 p 6 \u2212 873 4p The static bifurcation occurs whenHere in (A.17),p and the parameters satisfy the following condition: F s = \u03b1 2 4 + 1 2 \u03b3p 15 t + 5 \u03b1 2 4 + 1 2 \u03b1 2 3 \u03b3p 13 + 2 \u03b1 2 4 + 1 \u03b1 1p 12 + 2 2 \u03b1 2 3 \u03b1 2 4 + 5 \u03b1 2 3 + 4 \u03b1 2 4 \u03b1 2 4 + 1 \u03b1 2 3 \u2212 \u03b1 2 4 + 1 2 \u03b3p 11 + 2 3 \u03b1 2 3 \u03b1 2 4 + 5 \u03b1 2 3 + \u03b1 2 4 + 1 \u03b1 1p 10 + 3 \u03b1 2 4 2 \u03b1 4 3 + \u03b1 2 4 + 10 \u03b1 4 3 \u2212 5 + 2 \u03b1 2 4 8 \u03b1 2 3 \u2212 1 \u03b1 2 3 \u03b3p 9 + 6 \u03b1 2 3 + 1 \u03b1 2 4 + 20 \u03b1 2 3 + 10 \u03b1 1 \u03b1 2 3p 8 + 5 \u03b1 4 3 \u2212 10 + 2 4 \u03b1 2 3 + 1 \u03b1 2 4 \u03b1 4 3 \u03b3p 7 + 2 \u03b1 2 3 \u03b1 2 4 + 10 \u03b1 2 3 + 3 \u03b1 2 4 + 10 \u03b1 1 \u03b1 4 3p 6 + \u03b1 4 3 + 2 \u03b1 2 4 \u2212 10 \u03b1 6 3 \u03b3p 5 + 2 5 \u03b1 2 3 + \u03b1 2 4 + 10 \u03b1 1 \u03b1 6 3p 4 \u2212 5 \u03b1 8 3 \u03b3p 3 + 2 \u03b1 2 3 + 5 \u03b1 1 \u03b1 8 3p 2 \u2212 \u03b1 10 3 \u03b3p + 2 \u03b1 1 \u03b1 10 3 = 0.
