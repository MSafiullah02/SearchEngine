Science provides a platform for users to design and create projects, to engage with collaborators, to manage their research using a suite of tools, to prepare their research reports, and to preserve their research outcomes [1] . Century\", which provided guidance to the research enterprise and its stakeholders, to help them build strategies for achieving Open Science [1] . The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is also working for the recommendation on Open Science now, aiming to make access to scientific studies more open and inclusive [5] . Open Science can also create education opportunities, and help developing countries achieve sustainable development. Open Science might be helpful to reduce the widening disparity in terms of digital technology between developed and developing countries through stimulating a wider range of scientific collaboration and innovation by involving more participants and beneficiaries in developing countries.",

The principle of \"publish or perish\" makes scientists keep their ideas secret until published, which may consequently cause secrecy and taciturnity in the scientific community. Through sharing knowledge with others, developing a mutual comprehension of problems, and working collaboratively on research projects, Open Science intends to boost knowledge transfer and provides Open Educational Resources for teaching and learning, including software-based tools and services, and licenses that allow for open development and re-use of content, tools and services [2]. Universities, research institutes, foundations and publishers offer different types of training and consultancy services to students and researchers, to help them develop the skills that are necessary for Open Science practices. In October 2015, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published a report on \"Making Open Science a Reality\", addressing the importance of incentive mechanisms and clear legal frameworks for Open Science at both national and international levels [3]. In April 2018, European Commission published \"Recommendation on Access to and Preservation of Scientific Information\" and required the member states to set and implement clear policies about Open Science and Open Access [4]. In July 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine of the United States published a report \"Open Science by Design Realizing a Vision for 21st",

            "text": "A very encouraging example is shown in the efforts of many research institutions, universities and enterprises around the world who have been working together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Some publishers and leading journals have made COVID-19 research outputs free to readers. It is advocated that all the literature, data, clinical trial and other resources related to COVID-19 should be open for free access. So far, there are still some significant barriers and challenges to Open Science, such as intellectual property right, technology and cost. However, it is a belief that Open Science based on sharing and collaboration is not only an inherent need of innovation, but also a responsibility: scientific endeavor, innovation and creativity should benefit the global development for both developed and developing countries. Developing countries are facing various development challenges, such as health inequity, environmental contamination, climate change, food insecurity, education quality. World Health Organization reported in 2005 that more than half of medical institutions have no subscriptions to scientific journals in countries with an annual GNP per capita of less than USD 1 000. This means that Open Access to publications, open research data, open source software, open collaboration, open peer review, open notebooks and open educational resources are especially important for education and research in developing countries.",
