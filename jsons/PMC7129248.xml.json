            "text": "Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is one of the commonest reasons for consulting in primary care and accounts for considerable antibiotic use and health-care costs. It is neither feasible nor cost-efficient to identify microbial aetiology in most patients who present with LRTI in primary care because of sampling challenges, limited access diagnostics and the limited clinical utility of receiving a result after empirical treatment decision has been made [1]. Consequently, little is known about the aetiology of LRTI in everyday primary care. In addition, detecting pathogens in both symptomatic patients and contemporaneous controls to distinguish between asymptomatic carriage and the presence of agents causing symptoms has rarely been carried out. Nevertheless, despite limited knowledge of the proportion of patients that have an identifiable bacterial aetiology and the sensitivities of these pathogens, and evidence of limited or no clinical benefit from antibiotic treatment, more than half of patients presenting to primary care with LRTI/acute cough in Europe are prescribed antibiotics [2], [3], [4]. This contributes to the selection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria [5]. Improved knowledge of likely pathogens (at the point of care) and the likely susceptibility of bacterial pathogens, could help to guide antibiotic prescribing decisions and so help contain unnecessary antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, such information could support public health policy on prevention of respiratory illness, including vaccination.",

However, only 5% of patients in the most comprehensive aetiological study of adult patients hospitalized with CAP in the USA had pneumococcal pneumonia [14]. High-level penicillin resistance in pneumococci remains very low in all European countries in this setting, which supports the recommendation that if antibiotics are to be prescribed, amoxicillin should be the first-line agent for LRTI [1]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections occur in epidemics every 4\u20135 years: we included patients in our study between two epidemic waves, possibly explaining the low M. pneumoniae prevalence observed [15], [16].

HCoV have recently been identified in small numbers of adults with severe pneumonia [10], [21], but is not routinely tested for in adult outpatients with CAP or LRTI. We may have underestimated the prevalence of HCoV as HKU-1 testing was not performed and HKU-1 is generally as prevalent as NL63 and OC43 [22]. Infections due to HMPV are mainly described in long-term care facilities [10]. We found HMPV more prevalent in outpatients with CAP compared with those with other LRTIs, with even greater prevalence in CAP patients than respiratory syncytial virus, and similar to the 3%\u20137% HMPV infection prevalence found in hospitalized adults [23]. Although numbers are small, human adenovirus was significantly more prevalent in CAP compared with other LRTI, a unique finding in immunocompetent outpatients. The high rates of viral detection in outpatients with LRTI and CAP suggests that comprehensive microbiological assessment is important to guide management and may explain the limited average benefit from antibiotic treatment in the placebo-controlled study that we conducted in a large subset of patients included in the present analysis [2].",

As HBoV is often found in the presence of other pathogens in respiratory specimens we agree that HBoV probably has no relevance or primary role as a causative agent in LRTI in primary care [26]. There may be an association between high HBoV viral loads and HBoV being the only virus detected [27], suggesting that a quantitative approach should be considered [26].",
