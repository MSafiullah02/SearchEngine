In the present study, we report the potential inhibitory activity of some FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease by molecular docking study to investigate their binding affinity in protease active site. Docking studies revealed that drug Oseltamivir (anti-H1N1 drug), Rifampin (anti-TB drug), Maraviroc, Etravirine, Indinavir, Rilpivirine (anti-HIV drugs) and Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine, Amodiaquine, Tetracylcine, Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine (anti-malarial drugs) among others binds in the active site of the protease with similar or higher affinity. However, the in-silico abilities of the drug molecules tested in this study, further needs to be validated by carrying out in vitro and in vivo studies.

To predict the attraction and activity of binding of the minor molecule to their enzyme targets by using scoring functions docking is used.

As these residues play an important role during protein-ligand interaction, they may serve as a biomarker during the drug discovery process. 18 This study focused on identification of potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 from corona virus to control the viral replication. Outcomes from the In silico molecular docking study maintained the great inhibitory efficacy of the one anti-H1N1 drug (Oseltamivir), one anti-TB drug (Rifampin), four anti-HIV drugs (Maraviroc, Etravirine, Indinavir, Rilpivirine) and seven anti-malarial drugs (Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine, Amodiaquine, Tetracylcine, Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine) since they could launch H2 bonds with different amino acid residues that caused in an inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease activity with higher binding affinity ranging from (-10.67 to -8.3 kcal/mol). Thus, the projected binding interactions of the dynamic molecules with the protease by the docking study evidently established their inhibitory strength towards catalytic response of the protease. This study provides the support of the repurposed drugs, which may be helpful for the treatment of novel coronavirus disease and can serve as potential drug candidates to curb the ongoing and ever enlarging COVID-19 pandemic. Since all the drugs used in this study are of known pharmacokinetics standards and approved by FDA for human use they do not need to undergo specific long term clinical trials and therefore can fasten up the process of the therapeutics development.",

With this new finding of protease assembly in COVID-19, has providing an enormous chance to recognize possible drug candidates for the management of coronavirus. 20 In this study, we have applied a computational approach of FDA approved drugs in order to find a specific therapeutic possible agent against COVID-19.
