Antimicrobial stewardship is sometimes perceived as the utilitarian rationing of a vital resource, sacrificing the wellbeing of the present individual for a less immediate collective good. For the clinician, their principal duty to the patient in need outweighs this wider and more nebulous benefit. This view is perhaps most pertinent to critically ill patients, who are the highest per-capita consumers of antimicrobials [1] and who are at greatest risk of harm from untreated or undertreated infection [2, 3].",

This led to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines emphasizing the importance of timely, empirical, broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy [9]. However, the effect of the timing of initiation of antimicrobials in patients already in ICU is less clear cut, a large observational multi-centre study possibly suggested that adequacy of antimicrobial coverage may be more critical than time of initiation [10]. In clinical practice, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines have sometimes resulted in the indiscriminate of empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobials in patients who have uncomplicated infections (an area where the evidence base is far less certain) and in those who have no bacterial infection at all [11]. There is some evidence that suggests that an early empiric approach may cause harm. A quasi-experimental, before and after cohort study [12], performed on patients suspected of having an infection on a single Surgical ICU, compared early antimicrobial administration based solely on clinical grounds to a more conservative strategy, based on waiting for microbiological evidence of infection. There was a significant all-cause mortality benefit among patients treated with the more conservative approach (odds of death ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.5\u20134.0), despite a median 10-h prolongation in time to antimicrobial therapy, suggesting inappropriate antimicrobial therapy was associated with significant harm. This approach also appeared to translate into more appropriate antimicrobial choice and a shorter overall course duration.",

The potential harms of this were illustrated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of invasive versus non-invasive diagnostic strategies for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Patients in the invasive group had significantly reduced antimicrobial exposure which was associated with reduced risk-adjusted mortality [15]. Subsequent studies of diagnostic technique did not result in significant reduction in antimicrobial use or mortality [16, 17], implying that it was the reduction in antimicrobials rather than the method of diagnosis that was the key factor. Similarly, in the largest RCT evaluating procalcitonin (PCT) guided cessation of antimicrobials, PCT-guided treatment was associated with lower overall antimicrobial use and mortality [4]. However, the association between shorter duration of antimicrobial use and mortality was not demonstrated by other, smaller, studies [18].",

It should be noted that, in general, these trials were powered for non-inferiority, which may explain why many of them failed to identify any significant reduction in antimicrobial-associated harm. De-escalation of antimicrobials, being the reduction in spectrum and duration of agents, has been assessed in a number of observational studies in intensive care and one RCT [26], which did not show a survival advantage in de-escalation. However, this literature should give the intensivist confidence that in many cases the duration of antimicrobial courses can be safely shortened and de-escalated, thereby minimising the risk of adverse effects.",

Beyond type I (anaphylactic) reactions, there are a range of other idiosyncratic immune responses that range from mild eosinophilic drug rash to the severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Within this spectrum there are also a variety of systemic and organ-specific reactions such as serum sickness, hypersensitivity vasculitis, angioedema, acute interstitial nephritis [53]. There is a growing recognition that some of these reactions are not simple immune system-drug interactions, but also involve interactions with viral pathogens. Examples include the rash observed with penicillin treatment in Epstein-Barr Virus infection and the role of Human Herpes Viruses 6/7 in drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome [54]. Again, these reactions can, at times, be difficult to distinguish from the underlying disease process.",

What is also increasingly being appreciated is that exposure to antimicrobials can lead to colonisation/infection with pathogens resistant to not only the same class, but also different classes of antimicrobials. A study looking at the development of piperacillin-resistant P. aeruginosa VAP showed an association with prior fluoroquinolone treatment [68]. This likely underscores the complex selection pressures driven by antimicrobial therapy on the host microbiome, and how antimicrobial-associated dysbiosis (see below) relates to the selection of MDR organisms. A study performed in two ICUs in the Netherlands, utilizing mathematical modelling, suggested that the predominant route of acquisition of MDR Enterobacterales was endogenous (i.e. from selection pressure applied to the patient\u2019s own gut microbiome), rather than by exogenous cross-contamination (i.e. from other patients, healthcare workers or the environment) [69]. This suggests that infection control/hand hygiene precautions, that have been very effective at reducing rates of MRSA infection [70], may not be as effective in preventing MDR Gram negative infections and that antimicrobial therapy may well be a driver of MDR Gram-negative colonisation in the individual patient.",

A decrease in diversity and commensal organisms, with a concomitant increase in potential pathogens, has been described for the skin, oral, respiratory, and gastrointestinal microbiota of ICU patients [76\u201378]. In mechanically ventilated patients, a decrease in the diversity of the lung microbiome and increase in the abundance of potential pathogens such as staphylococci and Pseudomonas spp. has been reported [77]. Greater lung dysbiosis was demonstrated in patients with VAP compared to ventilated patients without VAP [79]. Despite inter-individual variation in the gut microbiome, marked reductions in bacterial diversity have been described in septic and non-septic critically ill patients [80]. Prolonged ICU admission has also been associated with low gut microbiome diversity and presence of MDR organisms [72]. Whilst the process of critical illness itself contributes to gut microbiome disruption, the frequent use of antimicrobials in ICU can further adversely impact gut microbiome diversity [72, 81]. The high frequency of antimicrobial administration in ICU, makes it challenging to disentangle these processes in human illness [76, 82] although animal models do imply both play a major role [83].",

In terms of human disease, perhaps the clearest example of a disease arising from dysbiosis is Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). Whilst the association between antimicrobial exposure and CDAD is long established, the realisation that this was not simply selection of a resistant organism has come more recently [89]. The role of dysbiosis in CDAD is underlined by the impressive response to faecal microbial transplant [90] and its ability to restore gut microbiota [91].",

Summary of findings from ex-vivo investigation. i Direct inhibition of mitochondrial complex (CI\u2013CIV) activity results in the inability to maintain an electrochemical gradient. ii\u2014iii The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential decreases the ability of the cell to generate ATP. Impaired Complex I and Complex III function result in leak of electrons from the ETC into the matrix, which then allows reaction with oxygen to form the superoxide free radical (O2\u2212). iv Inability of Complex I to form ROS impairs NLRP3 activation; whereas excessive mitochondrial ROS enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activity. In health, superoxide is reduced to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutase (SOD). The hydrogen peroxide is further reduced to water (H2O) by catalase. v If excessive superoxide is produced, the anti-oxidant system is overwhelmed resulting in DNA oxidation and damage. vi Consequently, the ability of the cell to generate new mitochondria (mitochondrial biogenesis) is impaired. vii Additionally, ciprofloxacin is able to inhibit DNA topoisomerase, thereby interfering with mitochondrial DNA replication. viii Beta-lactams fit carriers for mitochondrial substrate uptake, causing reduced succinate uptake. Succinate is converted to fumarate which itself has potent antibacterial effects.
