            "text": "Because indoor air quality is an important determinant of human health, comfort and productivity, high quality indoor air is desirable. Air cleaning technologies are of increasing importance, especially when building ventilation rates are being reduced to conserve energy. Numerous air cleaning technologies have been developed and used, but there have been no systematic assessments of these technologies. This is particularly true with regard to (1) application at realistic indoor conditions, (2) long-term performance, and (3) production of unwanted by-products during operation. The lack of widespread acceptance of reliable protocols for estimating the effectiveness of air cleaning systems has made it difficult to develop a standardized labeling system for indoor air cleaners, including standard methods for estimating Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). Consequently, a literature review was undertaken to collect state-of-the-art information on air cleaning technologies focusing on both their effects at removing indoor air pollutants and the problems that may occur during their application.",

The focus was only on air cleaning techniques for which indoor air flows through a device and is returned to the indoor environment (\u201cfan-driven\u201d air cleaners). Technologies like \u201ccatalyst in paint\u201d or other passive air purification materials, masks and other personal protective devices were not included. Botanic air cleaners that did not involve flow-through systems were also excluded. Air cleaning devices that are intended only for outdoor air intakes (e.g., filters in mechanical ventilation system) were not considered. Consequently the air cleaners reviewed included only: high efficiency particulate air (HEPA), adsorption, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), thermal catalytic oxidation (TCO), plasma, botanic air cleaners, ion generators, and electrostatic precipitators.",

The selected articles were limited to those which reported the tests involving pollutant concentrations within an order of magnitude of concentrations reported by the US EPA, WHO, and others to be typical in non-industrial indoor environments. This approach may have excluded some information related to particle filtration because standard test protocols are completed at elevated particle concentrations and there is general consensus that removal efficiency is not affected by standard test concentrations.",

These articles were reviewed by the panel using predefined inclusion criteria during their first meeting and some articles were found to be outside the scope of this review. Additions were also made by the panel. In this process 133 articles were selected for thorough review. Each article was reviewed by two scientists, one assigned to be a prime reviewer and the other one assigned to be secondary reviewer. Each scientist reviewed 17 to 18 articles. The articles were assigned to the reviewers completely at random and not depending only on their expertise; no article was assigned to a scientist if he was one of the authors. When reviewing the article, information on different aspects of the study was collected including design, methods, data analysis, measurements of airflow rates and air pollutants, possible bias, single-pass removal efficiency, CADR, creation of by-products, results and main conclusions. Reviewed articles were then classified as: relevant and conclusive \u2013 providing sufficient information on air cleaning effect, data processing and reporting; relevant but non-informative \u2013 lacking essential information; relevant but inconclusive \u2013 with incomplete data processing or reporting. Classification of each article was first made independently by each reviewer. Then, during the plenary meetings, the whole group agreed on a final classification.

(ISIAQ, 2010, WHO, 2010)\u2022Secondary indoor air pollutants refer to the intermediates or by-products produced by air cleaning devices, and released to indoor air.\u2022Single-pass removal efficiency is defined as the percentage (or fraction) of the target pollutant that enters an air cleaner and is removed by the cleaner.\u2022Effectiveness is defined as the fractional reduction in indoor pollutant concentration that results from application of a control device relative to the identical conditions without the control device in place (Nazaroff, 2000).\u2022Clean air delivery rate (CADR) is the equivalent clean airflow rate delivered by an air cleaner in which \u201cclean\u201d only refers to the absence of the target pollutants removed by the air cleaner. It is equal to the single-pass efficiency multiplied by the airflow rate through the device.\u2022Single-pass or flow-through test method is a method in which an air cleaner is placed between two tightly sealed chambers in such a way that one chamber is connected to the air cleaner intake and the other to the air cleaner outlet. The pressure drop between the chambers is adjusted to zero, so that the air cleaner operates as it would in a normal room. There is a constant airflow. Target pollutants (particles or gases) are constantly generated upstream and the concentration is measured in the upstream and downstream chambers.\u2022Decay test method involves an air cleaner that is positioned in a sealed chamber. The airborne pollutant(s) is (are) injected as a short-term release and mixed with the chamber air before activating the air cleaner. The concentration of the pollutant in the chamber air is measured over a specific time period. The CADR is calculated from the decay curve accounting for losses by deposition to chamber surfaces and air exchange rate, if any (Niu et al., 1998).\u2022Non-industrial indoor environments include any indoor environment not related to industrial exposures.\n",

            "text": "Most catalytic oxidation air cleaning studies focus on photocatalytic oxidation (Table 1). TiO2 is the most commonly-used material in PCO research. In some studies ozone was applied to enhance the performance of the catalysts (Ellis and Tometz, 1972, Kwong et al., 2008b). PCO is a general air cleaning technology, which can degrade almost all contaminants (such as aldehyde, aromatics, alkanes, olefins, halogenated hydrocarbons, odor compounds etc.). The competitive adsorption effect for contaminants and water vapor has a significant effect on the oxidation rate (Obee and Brown, 1995). Hybrid catalysts (combined TiO2 with adsorption materials such as activated carbon and zeolite) are used to enhance the PCO degradation of VOCs (Ao and Lee, 2003). In most studies only a single compound was tested, although often with good results. However, indoor air contains numerous contaminants, so tests of only one or a few compounds may be misleading. Furthermore, the generation of by-products is a serious problem for catalytic oxidation processes. Indeed, PCO can generate by-products (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde etc.) that are more harmful than the target pollutant (Hodgson et al., 2007, Muggli et al., 1998, Mo et al., 2009). Table 1shows that there is lack of field studies for PCO air cleaning in the 59 reviewed papers. Most of the studies were performed in small-scale laboratory settings, which resulted in their low CADR values (Fig. 2). PCO has high efficiency in the single-pass tests, but its efficiency is significantly reduced in the chamber tests (Fig. 3). This indicates that PCO technology is not ready for practical application.",

            "text": "Fifteen articles on air filters (some with activated carbon) underwent a detailed review process; recall that filters used on outdoor air intakes were not included in the review. Some of the articles focused on particle removal efficiency, but the particles studied were quite different, ranging from large microbes to very small particles. They all report a positive effect with regard to particle removal (higher removal efficiencies for larger particles), but sometimes not as high as the manufacturers\u2019 data indicate. VOC removal was investigated in four studies, with results ranging from zero removal (no activated carbon) (Batterman et al., 2005) to some removal (with activated carbon) (e.g., Bek\u00f6 et al., 2008). Removal of ozone by reactions with filters has also been observed by Bek\u00f6 et al. (2006) and Zhao et al. (2007). However, ozone reaction products released from filters have been reported (Bek\u00f6 et al., 2006, Bek\u00f6 et al., 2008, Bek\u00f6 et al., 2009, Hyttinen et al., 2007, Schleibinger and R\u00fcden, 1999). In summary, mechanical filters can efficiently remove particles, but are not as effective for organic and inorganic chemical pollutants. The main problem with mechanical filters is that they act as a pollution source if they are not properly used. A solution seems to be a combination of particulate filter and activated carbon, as shown by Bek\u00f6 et al. (2009), and Metts and Batterman (2006).",

Considering that ozone itself is quite harmful and that reactions with compounds such as terpenes can produce potentially harmful secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the ultra fine and fine size ranges (Waring et al., 2008), as well as reactive organic compounds, caution should be taken when using ozone-emitting air cleaning techniques (e.g., UVGI, plasma, electrostatic precipitator, and ion generators) in indoor environments, no matter whether they intentionally or unintentionally produce ozone.",

The technology is not efficient at removing gas-phase pollutants (Park et al., 2008). When combined with catalytic technology, plasma air cleaners have been observed to more effectively remove VOCs, such as toluene (Van Durme et al., 2007). If plasma is combined with UV-catalytic technology, the improved removal efficiencies for formaldehyde, benzene, toluene and xylene is promising (Park et al., 2008). The performance of plasma-catalyst technology for VOC removal can be inhibited by humidity (Van Durme et al., 2009). In general, plasma technologies can enhance the performance of filters for particle removal and catalysts for gas-phase pollutants. However, the production of secondary pollutants such as NOx and O3 is a major drawback of plasma technology (Van Durme et al., 2007).",

Desiccant wheels may be promising in controlling indoor air humidity and removing indoor VOCs simultaneously (Fang et al., 2008).

Adsorbents such as activated carbon can also be effective at removing reactant species (such as O3) by surface reactions; (2) Humidity and/or other indoor pollutants generally have a negative effect on target indoor pollutant removal due to competitive sorption; (3) The removal effect for multiple indoor compounds remains unknown; (4) For a target pollutant, the criteria for selecting the best sorption material to optimize removal over a given time period are generally not available; and (5) The lifetime for sub-ppbv level indoor air pollutants removal is unknown.",

(2) Sorption is an efficient technology for removing some gaseous pollutants, including VOCs, formaldehyde, O3, NO2, SO2, and H2S, provided that the sorption system is properly designed and operated. It may produce pollutants, especially if ozone reacts with contaminants that deposit on or are sorbed by the media. More information is needed on the long-term performance of air cleaners using sorption principles. (3) UVGI is a proven technology for inactivation of some airborne microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses, but ozone may be produced during operation. (4) PCOs can reduce concentrations of some gaseous pollutants (e.g., BTEX, ethanol, formaldehyde), but may generate harmful by-products. By-products need to be identified and controlled and catalyst poisoning must be understood when this technique is applied for prolonged periods. (5) Laboratory tests show that plasma air cleaning can reduce concentrations of some gaseous pollutants such as BTEX, ethanol, and formaldehyde. It can also produce harmful by-products such as ozone and oxidation intermediates, and its energy consumption tends to be high. (6) Ozone is not recommended for indoor air cleaning because of the harmful by-products. (7) The performance criteria of commonly-used fan-driven air cleaners, such as efficiency and CADR, strongly depend on the type of indoor air pollutants and the test conditions. Benchmarks and standard condition and procedures for evaluating air cleaner performance are necessary, and labeling of air cleaners will be valuable in the future.",
