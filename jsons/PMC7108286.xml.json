The type and degree of immune defect dictate which potential opportunistic pathogens are likely (Table 1\n). Opportunistic lung infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients immunocompromised because of HIV infection, haematological malignancy, aplastic anaemia or chemotherapy treatment, or who are recipients of solid-organ or stem cell transplants, and also can complicate treatment with the new biological therapies for inflammatory conditions. Immunocompromised patients also have an increased risk of infections caused by more conventional pathogens, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Expert clinical assessment with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are required for a positive outcome. Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive than plain chest radiography for defining the predominant pattern(s) of lung involvement. Combined with knowledge of the patient's immune status (loss of T-cell or antibody-mediated immunity, or defects in neutrophil-mediated immunity), this can often identify the most likely pathogens. This article provides a concise overview of the most common opportunistic lung infections.",

Viral infection, particularly influenza (including H1N1) has effects on lung host defences and predisposes to secondary bacterial infection,1, 2 which in immunocompromised hosts (particularly after chronic glucocorticoid use, chemotherapy for cancer and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)) can lead to more severe illness.
