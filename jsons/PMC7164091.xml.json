The free recombinant proteins of the three peptides (Fig. 1B) were obtained by digesting off GST peptide and performing chromatography [1] for further biochemical analysis. The inhibitory activity of recombinant proteins was assessed by an in\u2010gel activity assay and can be visualized by the clear zone of hydrolysis (Fig. 1C).

In an attempt to compare the antifungal effect of different peptides of tarocystatin, a bioassay on mycelial growth of Sclerotium rolfsii was carried out. FL (group\u20102) and Nt (group\u20101) peptides exhibited apparent antifungal activity at a concentration > 3.4 nm, but no antifungal activity was observed in the Ct peptide bioassay (Fig. 2A). It appeared that Nt peptide (group\u20101) was more effective than the FL peptide (group\u20102) (Fig. 2B). Although antifungal activity of phytocystatins from taro, strawberry and chestnut has been reported previously [7, 9, 17], the mechanism of inhibitory activity of phytocystatins against phytopathogenic fungi remains unclear. The presence of the Ct peptide in the FL peptide appears to be the cause of the reduction in antifungal activity. The hyphal morphology was also observed under low and high magnification microscopy. The growth\u2010retarded mycelium exhibited swelling, less branches and blunt tips at an Nt peptide concentration of 3.4 nm (Fig. 2C), and displayed swelling, no branches, very short tips and fragmentation at a concentration of 5.1 nm.",

A Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot of the reactions with varied inhibitor levels again showed competitive inhibition for Nt peptide and mixed inhibition for FL peptide (Fig. 4A,B). Thus, the presence of two inhibition types was confirmed. The inhibition constants (K\ni values) could be calculated from the apparent K\nm and V\nmax changes (Table 1). The K\ni value of Nt peptide (group\u20101) inhibition on papain was found to be 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 \nm. This value is very close to the K\ni of rice OC\u2010I (3.0 \u00d7 10\u22128 \nm) [18]. In addition, comparison of inhibitory activity with other group\u20101 species showed that K\ni for Nt peptide of tarocystatin is lower than those for rice OC\u2010II (8.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 \nm) [18], Job\u2019s tears cystatin (1.9 \u00d7 10\u22127 \nm) [19] and soybean cystatin L1 (1.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 \nm) [20], but higher than those for sesame (2.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 \nm) [8] and maize CCI (2.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 \nm) [21].

A prominent characteristic of mixed inhibition compared to competitive inhibition is that the mixed inhibitors bind to enzymes as well as enzyme\u2013substrate complexes, but competitive inhibitors bind only enzymes. Thus, the Ct peptide of tarocystatin may be able to dock onto the papain structure when the active site is occupied by a substrate. Furthermore, the occurrence of the K\nib value is always tailed with an unknown regulatory effect, indicating that the Ct peptide functions to alter the target protein conformation and prevent product formation. The Nt peptide functions like the entire OC\u2010I and confers tarocystatin with an affinity for the competing active site.",

Although there was no established template for Ct peptide 3D structure prediction, it shares 13% identity and 38% similarity to group\u20101 OC\u2010I (Fig. 5). Therefore, the Ct peptide structure was predicted using secondary structure estimation and a folding pattern simulation program with pseudo\u2010energy minimization. Subsequently, the entire tarocystatin 3D structure was obtained by combining the structures of two segments. Its conformation resembled an earphone comprising two solid masses and a linear structure (Fig. 6). A highly structural similarity between the Nt and Ct peptides was found and, presumably, the Ct peptide compete with the Nt peptide for binding to the active site (Fig. 6). However, the assay using varied concentrations in the range 0\u201310 000 \u03bcm of Ct peptide to compete with the Nt peptide at a concentration of 62.5 \u03bcm did not demonstrate that the Ct peptide reduced the inhibitory capacity of the Nt peptide (Fig. 7A).

Moreover, the Ct peptide of the group\u20102 phytocystatin shares a high consensus sequence among the discovered species [7]. Both the FL and Nt peptides exhibit a good inhibitory property on papain activity, whereas the Ct peptide exhibited papain activation that was also evident in an in\u2010gel inhibitory assay (Fig. 1C). The inhibition constant demonstrated that the FL peptide exhibited mixed inhibition, and the Nt peptide exhibited competitive inhibition, suggesting a canonical binding mode as with many other group\u20101 phytocystatin species previously reported (Table 2). The enhancement of the proteinase activity by 18% (Table 1) implicates that the interaction between papain and the Ct peptide possesses refolding in the conformation change of the papain protein. The mixed type inhibition against papain by the FL peptide might be due to the presence of the Ct peptide, which plays an activation role on papain when used alone. Therefore, the mechanism of the Ct peptide with respect to enhancing papain activity presumably involves allosterically binding adjacent to the active/substrate binding site and altering the papain conformation to be more accessible for the substrate, which is defined as the \u2018noncanonical\u2019 binding mode, where these inhibitory characteristics are quite different from the \u2018canonical\u2019 binding mode of group\u20101 phytocystatins, as noted previously [23]. This change may also shift the orientation of the Nt peptide to bind with competitive inhibition and result in blocking the substrate from the approaching catalytic site. When the Ct peptide was bound to papain and linked with the Nt peptide, substrates still had the chance to bind to the active cleft. Nevertheless, the Nt peptide was so close to active cleft that allows Nt peptide binding prior to any approaching substrates. Thus, the enhancing effect of the Ct peptide was followed by an immediate binding of the Nt peptide. In this case, substrates still could reach the active cleft and be trapped by some inner pulling force, but could not be fixed in the catalytic site that the Nt peptide blocked. This mechanism was like a noncompetitive inhibition, where substrates could bind to the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex but not to be turned to products. However, if the Nt peptide bound to papain before the Ct peptide, tarocystatin would simply exhibit competitive inhibition. The alternative binding pattern strongly supports the idea that tarocystatin is a mixed type inhibitor, and provides evidence for the difference between group\u20101 and group\u20102 phytocystatins.",

            "text": "Phytocystatin has been known for its defense function against attack by insects and pathogens. These proteins have received much attention from researchers due to their potential utilization as bioinsectides in agrobiotechnology [3, 4]. To extend our previous study on antifungal activity [7], a bioassay on mycelial growth of S. rolfsii was performed, and revealed that the FL and Nt peptides exhibited apparent antifungal activity at a concentration above 3.4 nm, but no significant antifungal activity was observed for the Ct peptide (Fig. 2A,B). Microscopic observations indicated that the Nt peptide appeared to be stronger than FL peptide (Fig. 2B). Because the Ct peptide alone does not show any antifungal effect, this implies that the antifungal activity might be connected to the Nt peptide conformation. A reduction of antifungal activity in vitro by FL peptide may be due to a molecular mass difference. It has been speculated that the FL peptide is larger than the Nt peptide, making it more inefficient to diffuse inside hyphal cells. The true mechanism responsible for the antifungal activity of tarocystatin still requires further investigation.",

Accumulating evidence shows that this repeated domain may originate from gene duplication and be exploited for other functions [10]. Recent evidence also demonstrated that carboxy terminus\u2010extended PhyCys have the capacity to inhibit human legumanin peptide due to the presence of the conserved motif SNSL and act as a bifunctional inhibitor [24]. Our findings focused on the Ct peptide on cysteine protease, which may function with three roles: (a) to endow the N\u2010terminal domain with more specificity and inhibition to papain; (b) to prevent the N\u2010terminal domain from rapid digestion by endogenous or exogenous peptidase; and (c) to enrich its molecular size as an ideal storage protein. Due to these beneficial characteristics, the Ct peptide could be reserved under evolutionary selection. Further studies, including mutagenesis and structural studies, are required to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the tarocystatin binding to papain and to identify the regulatory cleft involved in the inhibition process [15].",
