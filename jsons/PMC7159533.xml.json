Public health portals, such as the WHO (World Health Organization, 2014) portal, are usually maintained by government agencies or professional health organizations. They offer rich, diverse, and authoritative health information for users. For instance, the WHO portal posts updates, risk assessments, technical guidance, travel and health advice, and frequently asked questions on the recent Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus outbreak so that health users can access the much\u2010needed information in a timely fashion. Many public health portals have built\u2010in retrieval mechanisms with which people can search information, browse web pages of interest, and navigate the information space. These search means include, but are not limited to, internal search engines, sitemaps, subject directories, topic indices, and so on. In this study, the WHO portal was selected and investigated because it is an authoritative, reliable, and popular public health portal, has rich information, and maintains a subject\u2010oriented navigation guidance system. The topics and associated related link relationships in the guidance system can generate a topic network for investigation.",

SNA studies relationships in terms of nodes and ties, with nodes being the individual entities in the social network and ties being the relationships between individual entities. Research can be conducted in a number of different ways, depending upon whether the entities and relationships are abstract or physical objects. For instance, a physical object can be a web page and an abstract object can be a cluster of keywords or documents in a database. Salah, Manovich, Salah, and Chow (2013) analyzed user\u2010generated content that had been applied to a number of different media (i.e., videos, games, and images). These were the nodes. The relationships revealed through SNA can shed light into areas that are very subject specific. Hambrick (2012) used SNA to explore sport social networks, and found that through the integration of social network analysis, those involved in the sports industry promote products through Twitter.

(2012) used the subspace clustering algorithms to draw out the topics shared by people in the network, which detects all potential clusters in a network. Once the nodes within the social network have been identified, the next step is to analyze the relationships between those nodes. For example, the identification of the nodes as the athletes, teams, and leagues permitted Hambrick (2012) to dive deeper into their relationships in Twitter. This enabled the researchers to discover how information was spreading through the network, for example, the use of promotional tweets made by race organizers to provide information to followers. Hoppe and Reinelt (2010) discussed the importance of identifying strong and weak ties within leadership development and were able to break down different social networks as a result of identifying the relationships between the nodes\u2014for example, peer leadership network, organizational leadership network, field\u2010policy leadership network, and collective leadership network (Hoppe & Reinelt, 2010, p. 601). Measurement of the strong and weak ties can be done in a number of ways, depending upon the social network. Grabowicz, Ramasco, Moro, Pujol, and Eguiluz (2012) found that the more mentions exchanged between users, the stronger the ties between them. Knoke and Yang (2008) use the term cliques to describe the cohesion or relations between those involved in a social network. There are also strong identifiers associated with each clique.

The network node feature refers to density and centrality of a social network. The density is defined as the number of all actual edges (or connections) divided by the number of all possible edges in a network. It indicates the connection strength of a network. The centrality refers to the indicators that identify the most important nodes in a social network. These indicators were introduced later. If the network node feature data from the link connection network are not significantly different from those from the semantic connection network, it suggests that the validity of the navigation guidance system is confirmed.

Toward this objective, the CONCOR method and the F\u2010value cluster comparison analysis method were applied. The second is the network node feature comparison.

The correlation analyses between the centralities of a node and its information characteristics in the navigation guidance system were conducted using the Pearson correlation inferential analysis method.
