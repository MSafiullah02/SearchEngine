Canis lupus familiaris is subdivided into approximately 400 breeds, ranging in size and shape from the teacup chihuahua to the large Irish wolfhound. The domesticated dog may have descended from prehistoric canids in Europe roughly 18,000\u201332,000 years ago (Thalmann et al., 2013), although an East Asian origin is also possible (Savolainen et al., 2002).",

A colony of gray collies had been maintained at the University of Washington (Seattle) for the study of cyclic hematopoiesis. This condition is manifested by periodic fluctuations of the cellular components of the blood, most notably the neutrophil population. These dogs can be used to study the basic regulatory mechanisms involved with hematopoiesis, as well as possible treatments for both the human and the canine conditions (Brabb et al., 1995). Golden retrievers affected with muscular dystrophy have been used as models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in human children. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by an absence of the muscle protein dystrophin, inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The dystrophy in golden retrievers is caused by the absence of the same protein and is inherited in the same way. The clinical signs (such as debilitating limb contracture) are also similar between the canine and human conditions (Kornegay et al., 1994). Other genetic disorders studied in dog colonies include hereditary canine spinal muscle atrophy (Cork, 1991) and narcoplepsy in Doberman pinschers (Ripley et al., 2001). Bedlington terriers have been used to study copper storage diseases (such as Wilson\u2019s disease) and the development of spontaneous diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism has been studied in several breeds of dogs for comparisons with the human conditions.",

Usually these dogs are either beagles or mongrel foxhounds, although other breeds may be available. Purpose-bred dogs typically receive veterinary care throughout their stay at the breeding facility. They are usually vaccinated against rabies virus, canine distemper virus, parvovirus, adenovirus type 2, parainfluenza virus, Leptospira serovars Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa, and Pomona, and Bordetella bronchiseptica (Jasmin, personal communication).

Random-source dogs that have been treated and vaccinated in preparation for use in research are termed conditioned dogs.

Briefly, Class A licensees are breeders who raise all animals on their premises from a closed colony. Class B licensees purchase the dogs from other individuals (including unadopted animals from municipal pounds) and resell them to research facilities. There are additional regulations that apply to Class B dealers (such as holding periods and record-keeping documentation) because of the public concern that stolen pets could enter biomedical research facilities in this manner. In December 2013, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued notice NOT-OD-14-034 entitled Notice regarding NIH plan to transition from use of USDA Class B dogs to other legal sources (National Institutes of Health, 2013). This NIH policy begins in the fiscal year 2015 and prohibits the procurement of dogs from Class B dealers using NIH grant funds. From that point forward, dogs on NIH-funded studies will have to be obtained from Class A vendors, privately owned colonies (such as institutional breeding colonies), or client-owned animals (e.g., animals participating in veterinary clinical trials).",

The primary difference between the 7th and 8th editions of the \u2018Guide\u2019 (National Research Council, 1996, National Research Council, 2011) regarding the care of dogs is the notation that \u201cEnclosures that allow greater freedom of movement and unrestricted height (i.e., pens, runs, or kennels) are preferable.\u201d The ILAR Committee on Dogs authored Dogs: Laboratory Animal Management (National Research Council, 1994). This publication describes \u201cfeatures of housing, management, and care that are related to the expanded use of dogs as models of human diseases\u201d and includes \u201can interpretive summary of the Animal Welfare Regulations and the requirements of the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\u201d The reader is encouraged to use these publications to obtain further information on care and husbandry of dogs in the biomedical research setting.",

Open-Formula Diets have defined concentrations of all ingredients and the information is publicly available. This allows researchers to control for this important environmental variable and enables retrospective analysis of possible diet composition effects on research results (Barnard et al., 2009). Open-formula diets occasionally may require changes in formulation to maintain nutrient composition or meet changing nutrient requirements. These changes in quantitative ingredient formulation are made public when open-formula diets are modified. In contrast, closed-formula diets are commercially available, balanced diets that meet and label the minimum requirements for protein and fat and the maximum values for ash and fiber; however, the exact composition of ingredients may vary from batch to batch. Ingredient composition varies as the manufacturer applies a least-cost strategy, referring to formulating diets to maximize profit by using the least-expensive ingredients. Although the ingredients are listed, the quantitative ingredient formulation is not publicly available and can vary without public disclosure, due to proprietary nature of commercial diets produced and marketed under vendor trade names. Closed-formula diets have also been referred to as as \u2018fixed formula\u2019 or \u2018constant nutrition\u2019 (LabDiets, PMI Nutrition International, St. Louis, Missouri) by manufacturers (Barnard et al., 2009). In fixed-formula diets, the quantitative ingredient formulation does not change; however, this information is proprietary and therefore not disclosed publically (Barnard et al., 2009). Semi-purified and purified diets provide the strictest control of ingredients and are formulated from purified components: amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Although purified and semipurified diets do differ in the types of ingredients used, the terms are generally used to mean the same thing. Purified-ingredient diets are generally \u2018open\u2019 formulas, meaning that they are published and available to the scientific community.",

The endocrine feature of estrus is the first abrupt increase in progesterone (>5 ng/ml), which occurs concomitantly with the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge 95% of the time, followed by ovulation within 24\u201372 h. The vulva is softer and smaller than in proestrus. The vaginal discharge persists and may remain serosanquinous or become straw colored.",

At this time, the testicular growth is rapid, the seminiferous tubules begin to differentiate, and Sertoli cells form the blood\u2013testis barrier. Secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary stimulates the production of other key hormones by the Sertoli cells, including, inhibin, androgen binding protein, and estrogen. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis in the presence of testosterone, whereas inhibin and estrogen provide negative feedback to the pituitary gland to decrease FSH production. Spermatogenesis in the dog is completed in 45 days, with subsequent maturation of sperm occurring in the epididymis for approximately 15 days. Thus, the entire process from the initiation of spermatogonial mitosis to the delivery of mature sperm to the ejaculate is 60 days.",

In order to maximize the conception rate and litter size, it is recommended to breed the bitch on days 1, 3, and 5 of the standing heat. Due to the long life span of canine sperm, fertilization occurs in the oviduct up to 8 days after coitus. The ovulated oocyte is a primary oocyte that must undergo two meiotic divisions before fertilization can occur. This overall maturation process takes approximately 2 days. After maturation, the oocyte remains viable for 4\u20135 days. Optimal conception rates tend to occur when the bitch is bred from 4 days before to 3 days after ovulation; best litter size is achieved when the bitch is bred 2 days after ovulation.",

The AI catheter and guiding tube are inserted into the vestibulum as far as the pseudocervix. Firm abdominal palpation is then used to locate and fix the cervix in the other hand, at which point the catheter is further inserted along the dorsal vaginal fold until the cervical opening is located and semen is deposited into the uterus lumen (Thomassen and Farstad, 2009).",

Due to the similarities with the clinical signs seen in human cases of TSS, superantigens are thought to contribute to the virulence of S. zooepidemicus in cases of acute hemorrhagic pneumonia. These superantigens work by bypassing the conventional mechanisms of antigen presentation and binding to major histocompatibilitity complex class II receptors. As a result, there is a hyperactive proinflammatory response and an \u2018avalanche\u2019 of cytokines including interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Three novel superantigen-encoding genes have been identified from a case of acute fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia, szeF, szeN, and szeP. However, it is currently unclear what effect these superantigens have in vivo (Paillot et al., 2010, Priestnall et al., 2010). While superantigens have been detected in some isolates, there is not enough data to determine if superantigens play a role in the pathogenesis (Byun et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2007).",

Replacing sucralfate with famotidine, omeprazole, or bismuth subsalicylate may also be effective (Marks, 1997, Jenkins and Bassett, 1997, DeNovo and Magne, 1995). Recurrence rates within 60 days of treatment can be as high as 80% (Anacleto et al., 2011). Treatment of enterohepatic helicobacters may depend on species susceptibility. Aminoglycosides have been successful in treating H. cinaedi, but resistance to fluoroquinolones has been documented (Tomida et al., 2013). Combination therapy of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and omeprazole in medicated chow has been successful in eliminating various enterohepatic helicobacters from mice (del Carmen Martino-Cardona et al., 2010). Long-term antibiotic treatment at a minimum of 21 days is suggested for enterohepatic and gastric helicobacters.\n",

Giardia has a direct life cycle with infection resulting after consuming cyst-contaminated food or water.

Coccidia oocysts are typically spread by fecal\u2013oral transmission, but dogs can ingest monozoic cysts in intermediate host tissues.

Factors that influence development of clinical symptoms are the number and location of adult whipworms; the severity of inflammation, anemia, or hypoproteinemia in the host; and the overall condition of the host. Whipworm infestation is diagnosed by the presence of barrel-shaped, thick-walled eggs with bipolar plugs on fecal flotation. Adult worms intermittently release eggs; therefore, negative results do not exclude infection. Differential diagnoses for whipworm infestation include giardiasis, coccidiosis, and bacterial enteritis. Fenbendazole, oxibendazole, and milbemycin have all been recommended for treatment of whipworms. Treatment for whipworm infestation should be at monthly intervals for 3 months (Jergens and Willard, 2000).",

Other species include Taenia pisiformis and, more rarely, Echinococcus granulosus, Multiceps spp., Mesocestoides spp., and Spirometra spp. Most cestode infestations are subclinical, but severe infestations with Dipylidium can cause diarrhea, weight loss, and poor growth. The cestode requires an intermediate host, which for D. caninum are fleas and lice. Ingestion of these arthropods results in transmission of the tapeworm. Definitive diagnosis is usually made by the identification of egg capsules or proglottids (tapeworm segments) on the surface of the feces or around the anus. The most significant means to limit cestode infestation is to control flea and/or louse exposure. Praziquantel at 5\u201312.5 mg/kg orally or subcutaneously is the standard treatment for cestodiasis, especially Taenia or Echinococcus species. Fenbendazole, mebendazole, or oxfendazole may also be effective against D. caninum (Hall and Simpson, 2000).",

Localized demodicosis is typically asymptomatic, but disease can present with variable and nonspecific clinical signs, such as alopecia, erythema, pruritus, crusts, and hyperpigmentation. It can occur anywhere on the body but is often seen on the feet and face, and around the ears (DeManuelle, 2000a). Generalized demodicosis can develop in juvenile or adult populations and is indicative of an underlying immunosuppressive disorder. Demodex has a characteristic \u2018cigar shape\u2019 and can be identified from deep skin scrapings mounted on mineral oil (Campbell, 2000, Noli, 2000). Differential diagnoses include dermatophytosis, allergic contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis.

The most common clinical sign is an intense pruritus, usually beginning at sparsely furred areas of the ear pinnae, elbows, ventral thorax, and abdomen. Lesions are characterized by alopecia and yellowish dry crusts with a macular papular eruption. These lesions may be exacerbated by excoriation due to the pruritic nature of the condition. Adult mites, mite eggs, or mite feces may be observed on superficial skin scrapings, but diagnosis may be difficult because multiple skin scrapings may yield negative results. Even if scrapings are negative, a therapeutic trial should be initiated if the clinical signs and history suggest a Sarcoptes etiology. Demonstration of anti-mite IgE either in the serum or via an intradermal antigen test can be used as a diagnostic aid (Campbell, 2000). Histologic examination is nondia\u00adgnostic; however, suggestive lesions include small foci of edema, exocytosis, degeneration, and necrosis (Scott et al., 1995). An important differential diagnosis is flea allergy dermatitis (FAD). Unless antiparasitic therapy would interfere with research objectives, all dogs with sarcoptic mange should be treated. In addition, their kennel mates should also be treated due to the contagious nature of the disease and its zoonotic potential. The usual means of treatment is either ivermectin at 200\u2013400 \u03bcg/kg q14 days or milbemycin at 2 mg/kg q7 days for three oral doses (Scott et al., 1995).\n",

Genera that more commonly infest dogs in the United States include species of Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor, Amblyomma, and Ixodes. The primary significance of tick infestation is vector-borne infectious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto), thrombocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma platys), and canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis). Ticks alone cause minimal signs unless the dog develops a hypersensitivity reaction leading to a more granulomatous response at the bite location (Merchant and Taboada, 1991). Some species (primarily Dermacentor andersoni and D. variabilis) produce a salivary neurotoxin that causes an ascending flaccid paralysis (Malik and Farrow, 1991). Uncomplicated tick bites and tick-bite paralysis are diagnosed by identification of the tick and clinical signs of paralysis. Dogs with tick-bite paralysis usually show improvement within 24 h of tick removal, with complete recovery within 72 h (Malik and Farrow, 1991). Formamidines (amitraz), pyrethroids, and phenylpyrazoles (fipronil) are available as spot-ons, collars, sprays, and foggers to treat tick infestations in both the animal and the environment (Halos et al., 2014, Beugnet and Franc, 2012). Differential diagnoses for tick-bite paralysis include botulism, snakebite, polyradiculoneuritis, and idiopathic polyneuropathy (Malik and Farrow, 1991).",

Dogs that are hypersensitive to antigenic proteins in flea saliva develop severe FAD, which features papules, crusting, and excoriations over the lumbosacral region, flanks, thighs and abdomen. These animals may require oral corticosteroids to relieve clinical signs (Muller et al., 1983). Secondary bacterial and fungal infections can also develop. Fleas can also transmit other parasitic diseases, such as Dipylidium tapeworms. Flea infestations and FAD are definitively diagnosed by observing the fleas on the host\u2019s skin; however, the presence of flea excrement can support a presumptive diagnosis (DeManuelle, 2000b). Treatment of flea infestations should use an integrated pest management (IPM) approach that targets adult fleas, immature stages, and environmental contamination in order to limit the risk of chemoresistance. Combining ovicidal treatments, such as lufenuron and selamectin, with adulticidal treatments, such as fipronil, spinosad, selamectin, and imidacloprid, is recommended (Halos et al., 2014, Beugnet and Franc, 2012, Dryden et al., 2012). Certain chemicals (i.e., imidacloprid and selamectin) have both adulticidal and larvacidal abilities, but the principles of IPM preclude the use of one product solely for both adulticidal and larvacidal properties (Schwassman and Logas, 2009). Differential diagnoses include mite and louse infestations, bacterial folliculitis, and allergic or atopic conditions that present with skin lesions in dogs.",

Uncomplicated infections are characterized by circular areas of alopecia and crusting with or without follicular papules, usually around the face, neck, and forelimbs. Dermatophytes infect the hair shaft and follicle, as well as the surrounding skin. Infected hairs become brittle and broken shafts remain infective in the environment for months. Dermatophytoses are zoonotic and easily transmitted to other animals through the environment or by direct contact. Definitive diagnosis is made using dermatophyte test medium for culture. Hair and crust material from infected sites can be plucked and placed on culture; however, the \u2018toothbrush\u2019 method is more effective for sampling multiple sites. The brush is used to comb hairs and scales from several infected sites and then pressed into the culture media. Media plates should be visually inspected daily for 14 days. Positive cultures will become red at the same time as growth of a fluffy white colony. Microscopic examination of hairs and scales to visualize fungal elements can be done using skin scrapings in 20% KOH or mineral oil; however, this method is not very sensitive. Topical and systemic therapy should be initiated together after all suspected areas are clipped to reduce spreading of contaminated fragile hairs. Whole-body topical therapies with antifungal shampoos, rinses, and creams are recommended rather than spot treatment. Systemic therapy can be achieved with griseofulvin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole. Due to the highly infective nature of this disease, animals should be isolated and the environment thoroughly disinfected. Chlorhexidine and Virkon\u00ae S are ineffective at clearing environmental spores, but lime sulfur (1:33), enilconazole (0.2%), and bleach (1:10) are effective across many strains of Microsporum canis (Moriello and DeBoer, 2002).",

            "text": "Because it affects metabolism in general, hypothyroidism can produce a large number of clinical signs referable to many organ systems. An individual dog with hypothyroidism may have one or any combination of clinical signs. Hypothyroidism reduces the dog\u2019s metabolic rate, which then produces such signs as obesity, lethargy, cold intolerance, and constipation. Additionally, hypothyroidism can produce several dermatologic abnormalities, including nonpruritic, bilaterally symmetrical alopecia, hyperpigmentation, seborrhea, and pyoderma (Avgeris et al., 1990; Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera, 1994). Several clinicopathologic abnormalities have also been reported in a large percentage of hypothyroid dogs. These aberrations include increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides due to a decrease in lipolysis and decreased numbers of low-density lipopolysaccharide receptors (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Panciera, 1994). Normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia may be seen in approximately one-half of the cases (Avgeris et al., 1990). Increased serum alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase have also been reported in a significant number of hypothyroid dogs (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Panciera, 1994). Neurologic signs of hypothyroidism, which include lameness, foot dragging, and paresis, may be caused by several mechanisms such as segmental nerve demyelination or nerve entrapment secondary to myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Mental impairment and dullness have also been reported in hypothyroid dogs, secondary to atherosclerosis and cerebral myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Hypothyroidism has been implicated in other neurological abnormalities such as Horner\u2019s syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, megaesophagus, and laryngeal paralysis; however, these conditions do not always resolve with treatment (Bichsel et al., 1988, Panciera, 1994), and a true causal relationship with hypothyroidism has not been completely defined (Panciera, 1994). Myopathies associated with hypothyroidism are caused by metabolic dysfunction and atrophy of type II muscle fibers and can present with signs similar to neurological disease (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Hypothyroidism can also cause abnormalities of the cardiovascular system including bradycardia, hypocontractility, increased vascular volume, and atherosclerosis (Seguin and Brownlee 2012). Abnormalities that may be detected by ECG include a decrease in P- and R-wave amplitude (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) and inverted T waves (Panciera, 1994). These ECG abnormalities are caused by lowered activity of ATPases and calcium channel function.",

            "text": "Currently, the ability to diagnose hypothyroidism relies heavily on the measurement of serum total T4 (thyroxine) and free T4 (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Ferguson, 1994). T4 serves primarily as a precursor for T3 and is heavily protein bound. Free T4 represents the unbound fraction that is available to the tissues (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). The measurement of total T4 carries a sensitivity of around 95% and can be used as a good screening tool. With the measurement of both serum total T4 and free T4, hypothyroidism can usually be ruled out if the values are within the normal range or higher. If both hormone concentrations are low, it is highly likely that the patient has hypothyroidism, and a therapeutic trial may be in order (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). However, nonthyroidal illnesses and some drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, phenylbutazone, salicylates) can falsely lower these values (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Ferguson, 1994). Therefore, low values do not always indicate that hypothyroidism is present and animals should not be treated solely on the basis of serum hormone levels if clinical signs are not present. If the clinical signs are equivocal or only total T4 or free T4 is decreased, further diagnostic testing is warranted (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Although T3 is the most biologically active form of thyroid hormone, the measurement of serum T3 levels is an unreliable indicator of hypothyroidism (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Ferguson, 1994). Serum T3 can be falsely lowered by many nonthyroidal illnesses and many drugs (see above). In addition, T3 may be preferentially released and conversion of T4 to T3 may be enhanced by the failing thyroid (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Ferguson, 1994), particularly early in the disease. In one study, T3 was within normal limits in 15% of the hypothyroid dogs (Panciera, 1994). Autoantibodies can be responsible for false elevations in the concentrations of T3 and T4 found in these respective assays. It has been recommended that free T4, measured by equilibrium dialysis, be assayed in dogs that are suspected of hypothyroidism and have autoantibodies with normal or high T3 and T4. Autoantibodies have been found in less than 1% of the samples submitted to one laboratory (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000).",

In humans, endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels provide reliable information on thyroid status, and an assay is available for dogs. However, endogenous TSH levels can be normal in some dogs with hypothyroidism and high TSH levels have been noted in normal dogs and sick animals that are actually euthyroid. It is therefore recommended that TSH levels be considered along with other information (clinical signs, T4) prior to diagnosis and treatment (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000). TSH stimulation testing using exogenous bovine TSH provides a good and reliable method for establishing a diagnosis. Unfortunately, the availability and expense of TSH limit the use of this diagnostic tool (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Ferguson, 1994). Another drawback of TSH testing is that the test must be postponed for 4 weeks if thyroid supplementation has been given (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). When TSH is available for testing, there are several recommendations for dosage, routes of administration, and sampling times. One recommendation is 0.045 U of TSH per pound of body weight (up to a maximum of 5 U) to be administered IV. For this protocol, blood samples are taken prior to administration of TSH and 6 h after. A normal response to the administration of TSH should create an increase of T4 levels at least 2 \u03bcg/dl above the baseline levels or an absolute level that exceeds 3 \u03bcg/dl (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989, Wheeler et al., 1985).",

            "text": "Obesity is defined as a body weight 20\u201325% over the ideal. In general, obesity occurs when the intake of calories exceeds the expenditure of energy, the result of overeating or eating an unbalanced diet. Overeating is a common cause of obesity in pet dogs and may be triggered by boredom, nervousness, or conditioning (MacEwen, 1992). In addition, pet animals are often subjected to unbalanced diets supplemented with high-fat treats. In the laboratory animal setting, overeating is less likely than in a household because access to food is more restricted, and diets are usually a commercially prepared balanced ration. However, obesity can still be a problem if specific guidelines for energy requirements are not followed. In addition, the necessary caging of dogs in the research environment and limitation to exercise reduces energy expenditure. It is also important to realize that other factors may predispose dogs to obesity, even when guidelines for caloric intake and energy expenditure are followed (Butterwick and Hawthorne, 1998). As in humans, genetics plays an important role in the development of obesity in dogs, and certain breeds are more predisposed toward obesity. In a study of dogs visiting veterinary clinics in the United Kingdom, Labrador retrievers were most likely to be obese. Other breeds affected included Cairn terriers, dachshunds, basset hounds, golden retrievers, and cocker spaniels. The beagle was also listed as a breed predisposed to obesity in the household environment (Edney and Smith, 1986).",

When the ribs are not easily palpated and/or the dog\u2019s normal function is impaired by its weight, the animal is considered obese. There are few objective, quantifiable methods for establishing this diagnosis. Ultrasound has been evaluated for measurement of subcutaneous fat in dogs, and measurements taken from the lumbar area can be used to reliably predict the total body fat (Wilkinson and McEwan, 1991). After a diagnosis of obesity has been made, additional diagnostic tests should be performed to determine if there is an underlying cause for the problem. A complete physical exam should be performed to look for signs of concurrent disease and to establish if obesity has adversely affected the individual. Serum thyroid hormones should be evaluated (see above), and serum chemistry may reveal an increased alkaline phosphatase associated with hyperadrenocorticism.",

Alternatively, several diet dog foods are available, and there is some evidence that these diets are superior to simple volume restriction (MacEwen, 1992). There has been much concern about the addition of fiber to the diet as a method for reducing caloric intake while maintaining the volume fed. Studies in dogs have examined the addition of both soluble and insoluble fibers to calorie-restricted diets. These studies have shown that the addition of fiber does not have an effect on satiety in dogs and therefore does not have a beneficial effect in weight loss protocols (Butterwick et al., 1994, Butterwick and Markwell, 1997).",

When first recognized, the wound should be covered with a sterile dressing until definitive treatment can be rendered. Bleeding should be controlled with direct pressure; tourniquets are discouraged because of the complications that may arise with inappropriate placement (Swaim, 1980). It is best to avoid using topical disinfectants in the wound until further wound treatment (culture, debridement, lavage) has been performed (Swaim, 1980). Anesthesia or analgesia may be necessary and the choice of agent will depend on the size and location of the wound as well as the preference of the clinician. If the wound is contaminated or dirty, bacterial cultures, both aerobic and anaerobic, should be performed. Then a water-soluble lubricant gel may be applied directly to the wound to prevent it from further contamination during the hair removal process. A wide margin of hair should be clipped and a surgical scrub performed around the edges of the wound. Povidone-iodine alternating with alcohol or chlorhexidine gluconate scrub alternating with water is most often recommended for surgical preparation of the skin surface (Osuna et al., 1990a, Osuna et al., 1900b). Simple abrasions that involve only a partial thickness of the skin do not generally require further treatment. Full-thickness wounds require further attention, including irrigation with large quantities of a solution delivered under pressure. Several irrigation solutions have been recommended (Lozier et al., 1992, Waldron and Trevor, 1993, Sanchez et al., 1988), but type may not be as important as the volume and pressure of delivery. It has been suggested that 8 psi is required to obtain adequate tissue irrigation, and this may be achieved by using a 35-ml syringe with an 18- or 19-gauge needle (Waldron and Trevor, 1993).",

In addition, other factors such as edema or hypovolemia may reduce bleeding in otherwise viable skin (Waldron and Trevor, 1993). If one is unsure about tissue viability in areas that are devoid of extra skin, the tissue may be left (Swaim, 1980, Waldron and Trevor, 1993), and nonviable areas will demarcate within 2\u20133 days (Waldron and Trevor, 1993). Necrotic fat should be resected liberally, because it does not have a large blood supply and will provide an environment for infection. Often, resection of subcutaneous fat is necessary to remove debris and hair that could not be removed during wound irrigation. Damaged muscle should also be liberally resected (Swaim, 1980). The wound should be irrigated several times during debridement and again after completion.",

The principles of basic surgery are discussed in several good texts, and readers are encouraged to pursue additional information. Primary wound closure is defined as closure at the time of initial wound therapy and is the treatment of choice for clean and clean-contaminated wounds. Closure is performed in two or more layers, carefully apposing tissues and obliterating dead space. If dead space will remain in the wound, a drain should be placed. Subcutaneous closure should be performed with absorbable suture such as polydioxanone, polyglactin 910, or polyglycolic acid. It is best to use interrupted sutures and avoid leaving excess suture material in the wound. It may be necessary to choose tension-relieving suture patterns, such as horizontal mattress. Skin closure is generally performed with nylon (3-0 or 4-0).",

After debridement and irrigation, the wound should be bandaged. The wound may be covered by a nonadherent dressing such as vaseline-impregnated gauze (Swaim, 1980). The contact layer is covered by cotton padding, and the entire bandage is covered by a supportive and protective layer. The bandages should be changed once or twice daily, depending upon the amount of discharge coming from the wound. Wound closure within 3\u20135 days of wounding (prior to the formation of granulation tissue) is considered delayed primary closure. When the wound is closed after 5 days, this is considered secondary closure (Waldron and Trevor, 1993). Second-intention healing involves allowing the wound to heal without surgical intervention. This type of healing is often used on limbs when there is an insufficient amount of skin to allow complete closure (Swaim, 1980). It is important to note that second-intention healing will take longer than with surgical repair, and, in the case of large wounds, it will be more expensive because of the cost of bandaging materials.",

When wounds have been severely contaminated or are dirty, antibiotics are indicated and the type of antibiotic will ultimately depend on culture and sensitivity results. Until such results are available, the choice of antibiotic is based on the most likely organism to be encountered. Topical application of bacitracin, neomycin sulfate, and polymixin B combinations may be used in wounds with minor contamination. In skin wounds with more extensive contamination, Staphylococcus spp. are generally of concern, whereas Pasteurella multocida should be considered in bite wounds.

Skin hygiene is of the utmost importance when trying to prevent or treat pressure sores. The skin should be kept clean and dry at all times. If urine scalding is a problem, the affected area should be clipped, bathed, and dried thoroughly at least once or twice daily. Finally, an appropriate diet to maintain body weight will minimize compressive forces experienced over areas susceptible to ulceration (Swaim and Angarano, 1990).",

When wounds involve deeper tissues, including fat, fascia, or bone, more aggressive diagnostics and therapy must be performed.

All of the damaged tissue should be debrided and basic wound management guidelines should be followed (see above).

One of the most important aspects of treatment is to break the cycle of self-trauma. Mechanical restraint with an Elizabethan collar is one of the easiest methods to accomplish this goal. Several direct treatments have been examined, including intralesional and topical steroids, perilesional cobra venom, acupuncture, radiation, and surgery (Swaim and Angarano, 1990, Walton, 1986). Opioid antagonists have been applied as treatments for acral lick granulomas and self-injurious behaviors with the theory that this will block the effects of endogenous opioids. Naltrexone and nalmefene have been used successfully to reduce excessive licking behaviors and resolve associated lesions. However, lesions did recur after the drugs were discontinued (Dodman et al., 1988, White, 1990). The topical administration of a mixture of flunixin meglumine, steroid, and dimethyl sulfoxide has also been shown to be effective (Walton, 1986). In addition, psychoactive drugs have been suggested to relief of boredom or anxiety. These have included phenobarbital, megestrol acetate, and progestins. However, side effects have been reported (Swaim and Angarano, 1990). Other behavior-modifying medications such as clomipramine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive anxiety disorder. The potential for effects that could interfere with experimental results must be determined prior to initiation of treatment. It is important to note that none of the above-mentioned treatments have been successful in all cases. The overall prognosis for acral lick granuloma should be considered guarded since the lesions often recur when treatment is discontinued.",

A soft padded bandage or doughnut bandage around the affected site may also be of benefit. Neoprene/polyester sleeves that cover the elbows and fit over the shoulders are also available as an option for either prevention or treatment of hygromas (Cannap et al., 2012). More aggressive therapies, including needle drainage and injection of corticosteroids into the hygroma, have been described but are not recommended due to the risk of infection (Johnston, 1975). Surgical options should be reserved for complicated or refractory cases. Even simple excision can be associated with complications such as wound dehiscence and ulceration (Johnston, 1975) due to the location of the bony prominence at the surgical site. This issue may be avoided by using a skin advancement flap (White, 2003) that allows intact, healthy skin to cover the boney prominence.

Catheters and other implants should be made of nonthrombogenic material and be as simple as possible. A catheter with extra ports or multiple lumens requires additional management and supplies more routes for infection. The initial placement of an indwelling catheter must be done under aseptic conditions by individuals who are familiar with the procedure. Intravenous catheters that are used for delivery of drugs or blood sampling should be positioned in the vena cava and not in the right atrium, thereby minimizing trauma to the tricuspid valve. Ideally, catheters are secured to reduce movement and irritation of the skin, which may predispose to infection around external ports. The use of vascular access ports that lie entirely under the skin eliminates many problems with infection. It has also been found that long extension tubing connected to the port may actually reduce the potential for infection of the catheter (Ringler and Peter, 1984). For intestinal access ports, catheter security may be improved with a synthetic cuff added to the end of the catheter allowing better attachment to the intestine (Meunier et al., 1993). After any catheter placement, animals should be observed daily for signs of either local or systemic infection. The catheter entry site should be disinfected, coated with antibiotic ointment, and rebandaged every other day. Once a month, the catheter line may be disinfected with chlorine dioxide. In addition, a solution of the antibiotic ceftazidime used on alternate days with the heparin locking solution has been shown to effectively reduce infections in indwelling vascular catheters (Bach et al., 1998).",

However, extreme inflammation without infection (e.g., pancreatitis, trauma) may create similar signs. One study examined the diagnosis of sepsis in canine patients at a veterinary hospital based on easily obtainable physical and laboratory findings. That study found that septic individuals had higher temperatures, WBC counts, and percentage of band neutrophils than nonseptic individuals, whereas platelet counts were lower in the septic dogs. There were no differences in respiratory rate or glucose levels between the groups. Using these criteria, the results had a high sensitivity and a tendency to overdiagnose sepsis (Hauptman et al., 1997). Ultimately, the presence of a septic focus simplifies diagnosis greatly; however, the focus may not be obvious. If the signs of sepsis are evident but the focus is not, several areas should be evaluated for infection, including the urinary, reproductive, respiratory, alimentary, and cardiovascular systems, as well as the abdominal cavity (Kirby, 1995).",

When small amounts of a relatively innocuous substance (e.g., barium) have been aspirated, treatment may not be necessary. When severe inflammation is present, systemic as well as localized therapy may be necessary. Oxygen therapy may be instituted; however, the concentration and time frame are controversial, because lung injury may be exacerbated by long-term administration of oxygen at high concentrations (Nader-Djahal et al., 1997). Fluid therapy may also be necessary in severe cases; however, cardiovascular support should be performed judiciously as fluid overload could lead to an increase in pulmonary edema. The use of colloids is also controversial because of the increase in vascular permeability that occurs in the lungs. Several studies have addressed the use of anti-inflammatory agents to reduce lung injury associated with aspiration; however, none are used clinically in human or veterinary medicine at this time. Corticosteroids are contraindicated (Raghavendran et al., 2011).",

For the treatment of perivascular injections, dilution of the drug with subcutaneous injections of saline is recommended. In addition, steroids may be infiltrated locally to reduce inflammation. Topical application of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may also be helpful in reducing the immediate inflammation and avoiding the development of chronic lesions. The addition of lidocaine to subcutaneous injections of saline has been used in cases of thiacetarsemide injection (Hoskins, 1989).

Prior to the injection, the catheter should be checked repeatedly for patency by withdrawal of blood and injection of saline. Any swelling at the catheter site or discomfort by the subject indicates that the catheter should not be used. Access to a central vessel such as the cranial or caudal vena cava is preferred over the use of peripheral vessels. When peripheral catheters are used, the injection should be followed by a vigorous amount of flushing with saline or other physiological solution and removal of the catheter. Additional injections are best given through newly placed catheters in previously unused vessels. The repeated use of an indwelling peripheral catheter should be approached cautiously and done only out of necessity.",

The nuclei are round and regular, the cytoplasm is packed with large granules that stain deeply, and mitotic figures are rare to absent. Grade II (intermediately differentiated) mast cell tumors have indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries with higher nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic ratios, fewer granules, and occasional mitotic figures. Grade III (anaplastic or undifferentiated) mast cell tumors have the worst prognosis. The cells contain large, irregular nuclei with multiple prominent nucleoli and few cytoplasmic granules. Mitotic figures are much more frequent. Cells are pleomorphic with indistinct borders. In addition to associated skin lesions (e.g., ulceration, collagenolysis, necrosis, and infection), mast cell tumors have been associated with gastric ulcers in the fundus, pylorus, and/or proximal duodenum, most likely secondary to tumor production of histamine. Histamine stimulates the H2 receptors of the gastric parietal cells, causing increased acid secretion.

For most dogs in research studies, this is a viable option to rapidly improve the animal\u2019s condition. The alternative to castration is hormonal therapy, primarily with estrogens. This may be applicable in cases where semen collection is necessary from a valuable breeding male (e.g., genetic diseases). If the research study concerns steroidal hormone functions, then neither the condition nor the treatment is compatible. Finasteride, a synthetic 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor, has been used in dogs to limit the metabolism of testosterone to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone. Treatment at daily doses of 0.1\u20130.5 mg/kg orally for 16 weeks was shown to reduce prostatic diameter and volume without affecting testicular spermatogenesis (Sirinarumitr et al., 2001). Upon discontinuation of finasteride, the prostate generally returns to its pretreatment size within several months (Smith, 2008). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs such as desorelin inhibit production of testosterone and estrogen via negative feedback on the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary axis. This is available in a sustained release subcutaneous implant, which has demonstrated efficacy in reducing prostatic size in dogs (Junaidi et al., 2009).
