However, our understanding of 35 pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest 36 proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have 37 conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and 38 evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially 39 needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich 40 bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals 41 and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males 42 and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic 43 diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-44 divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. 45",

Whereas degree indicates the number of other 309 species with which a host shares bacterial genotypes (i.e., links per node), eigenvector centrality 310 indicates the tendency for a host to share genotypes with species that also share more genotypes 311 (i.e., connectivity). Eigenvector centrality is thus an extension of degree that can identify hubs of 312 parasite sharing (G\u00f3mez, Nunn, & Verd\u00fa, 2013). These two metrics were moderately correlated 313 (\u03c1=0.59), with many non-zero degree species displaying zero eigenvector centrality. To examine 314 spatial and temporal patterns in host centrality, we built separate adjacency networks per each 315 site and year. We fit separate GLMs to ask how hemoplasma sharing centrality was predicted by 316 site, year, and the two-way interaction. Degree was modeled as a Poisson-distributed response, 317 while eigenvector centrality was logit-transformed and used Gaussian errors. We next applied 318 phylogenetic factorization to both metrics and weighted the algorithms by the square-root sample 319 size per species (Garamszegi, 2014). We then fit the same PGLS models used in our prevalence 320 analysis to identify the most competitive trait predictors of bat species centrality to hemoplasma 321 sharing. To lastly assess whether network centrality is associated with hemoplasma prevalence, 322 we fit two weighted PGLS models with each centrality metric as a univariate predictor. 323 324",

Across the bat community, hemoplasma 413 infection risk was weakly higher for males but was better predicted by phylogeny, with large-414 bodied and large-colony bat species showing greater prevalence. Hemoplasmas showed high 415 diversity and mostly strict host associations, with strong congruence between the bat and 416 hemoplasma phylogenies. Although codivergence was supported by our analyses, we also 417 20 observed hemoplasma genotype sharing and evidence of historical host shifts between closely 418 related bats. Species most central to this hemoplasma sharing network displayed taxonomic 419 clustering and were disproportionately frugivores and nectarivores. Yet these highly central bat 420 species did not also have the highest hemoplasma prevalence, reinforcing mostly infrequent 421 bacterial sharing between species. Our work reveals phylogenetic patterns in hemoplasma 422 infection in a diverse bat community while contributing to broader efforts to understand the host 423 specificity of bacterial pathogens and their cross-species transmission patterns in wildlife.424 Whereas many bacterial pathogens, including hemoplasmas, are common in bats (Bai et 425 al., 2011; Becker et al., 2018; Ikeda et al., 2017; Mascarelli et al., 2014; Mill\u00e1n et al., 2015; 426 Volokhov et al., 2017), the factors that confer high infection probability are poorly understood. 427 In the Belize bat community, the odds of hemoplasma infection tended to be higher in males, 428 suggesting male-biased transmission as detected in feline and canine systems (Soto et al., 2017; 429 Walker Vergara et al., 2016). Such patterns could stem from males mounting weaker immune 430 responses than females (Kelly, Stoehr, Nunn, Smyth, & Prokop, 2018) or to male defense of 431 multi-female roosts in many Neotropical bat species (Voigt, von Helversen, Michener, & Kunz, 432 2001). Direct transmission of hemoplasmas has been demonstrated in feline and rodent systems 433 (Cohen et al., 2018; Museux et al., 2009) but only inferred in bats from metagenomic studies 434 detecting these bacteria in saliva (Volokhov et al., 2017). We found weak support for the 435 hypothesis that ectoparasites play a role in infection risks (Hornok et al., 2019; Willi, Boretti, 436 Meli, et al., 2007). The weak male bias in infection could cast further doubt on vector-borne 437 transmission, as females in some bat species have elevated ectoparasitism (Frank, Mendenhall, 438 Judson, Daily, & Hadly, 2016); however, a secondary GLMM testing this hypothesis found 439 generally weak support for a female bias in ectoparasitism in our system (Fig. S9). Future work 440 assessing ectoparasite burdens could better elucidate the roles of vectors in hemoplasma risk. 441 Across Neotropical bats sampled in Belize, we found phylogeny to be a better predictor 442 of hemoplasma risk than individual traits, site, or year. Phylogenetic factorization identified one 443 clade, the Emballonuridae, with significantly lower prevalence than all other bats in the 444 community. This moderate phylogenetic signal mirrors comparable effects of phylogeny for bat 445 viruses (Guy, Thiagavel, Mideo, & Ratcliffe, 2019), similarly suggesting potential for innate 446 differences in species susceptibility or pathogen exposure. Trait-based analyses revealed that this 447 taxonomic pattern was driven by heavier and large-colony species having greater hemoplasma 448 prevalence. Small-bodied species could have low prevalence due to small blood volumes and 449 low bacterial titers (Volokhov et al., 2017). Alternatively, the positive, saturating relationship 450 between body mass and bacterial prevalence could be driven by allometric patterns in 451 competence (Downs et al., 2019), in contrast to weak or opposite relationships between mass and 452 viral richness across bats (Guy et al., 2019; Han, Schmidt, et al., 2016). As larger-bodied bat 453 species can also be more abundant in Neotropical habitat fragments (Herrera et al., 2018), these 454 results suggest land conversion could increase the frequency of bat species most capable of 455 maintaining hemoplasma infection. Similarly, positive relationships between colony size and 456 prevalence could support density-dependent transmission of bacteria (McCallum et al., 2001), 457 whereas mixed support has been found for bat viruses (Streicker et al., 2012; Webber, Fletcher, 458 & Willis, 2017). Future work could test how community-wide infection patterns vary across 459 broader habitat gradients and use multiple bacteria to assess the generality of these trends. 460 Approximately two-thirds of the Neotropical bat species sampled in Belize were infected 461 by hemoplasmas, for which we observed high genetic diversity consistent with other studies of 462 22 this pathogen in bats (Mascarelli et al., 2014; Mill\u00e1n et al., 2015; Volokhov et al., 2017). 463 However, these bacterial genotypes were mostly novel and only weakly related to hemoplasmas 464 described elsewhere in Latin America (Ikeda et al., 2017; Mill\u00e1n et al., 2019), with the exception 465 of those previously identified from vampire bats (Volokhov et al., 2017). When considering the 466 phylogenetic scale of genotypes, most hemoplasmas were host specific. Over half our 467 hemoplasma communities consisted of a single bat-genotype association, matching the degree of 468 host specificity observed more generally for Mycoplasma spp. (Citti & Blanchard, 2013; Pitcher 469 & Nicholas, 2005). When we did detect genotype sharing between species, this occurred mostly 470 between closely related hosts (e.g., PPM was detected in Pteronotus mesoamericanus and P. 471 fulvus), indicating bat phylogenetic distance decreased the probability of bacterial transfer. 472 Analyses to characterize species centrality to the hemoplasma genotype sharing network 473 showed that one species (Artibeus lituratus) and the subfamily Stenodermatinae played key 474 roles. This clade, and especially the genera Artibeus and Dermanura (formerly all classified in 475 Artibeus), was the only taxon with non-zero connectivity, and this pattern was reflected in fruit-476 and nectar-based diets and small colonies being the primary predictors of centrality. The strictly 477 frugivorous Stenodermatinae represents a recent divergence in the Phyllostomidae (Botero-478 Castro et al., 2013), and high centrality of these species may indicate weaker phylogenetic 479 barriers for bacterial transmission between hosts in this clade. Two other analyses reinforced 480 infrequent and conserved hemoplasma sharing between species. First, phylogenetic patterns in 481",

            "text": "closely related hosts (De Vienne et al., 2013). Though we cannot rule out that some 486 host shifts may be artefacts of the limited resolution of both the phylogenies, our evolutionary 487 analyses and genotype sharing results imply that hemoplasma host shifts are possible yet rare. 488 By sampling a diverse assemblage of bacterial genotypes in an ecologically and 489 evolutionary rich host community, our work has broader implications for our understanding of 490 disease emergence. Many bacterial pathogens are thought to be generalists and relatively 491 unlikely to specialize in a novel host (Pedersen, Altizer, Poss, Cunningham, & Nunn, 2005; 492 Woolhouse & Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005), in contrast to many viruses in which host shifts are 493 more common owing to high mutation rates and short infectious periods (Geoghegan et al., 2017; 494 Longdon, Brockhurst, Russell, Welch, & Jiggins, 2014). Recent theoretical work suggests host 495 shift speciation may be less common for bacteria because of higher phenotypic plasticity (e.g., 496 the ability to reside in diverse habitats) and a slower tempo of evolution (Bonneaud et al., 2019). 497 Obligate reliance of Mycoplasma spp. on host cells and more chronic infections likely explains 498 their propensity to specialize (Citti & Blanchard, 2013; Cohen et al., 2018). More broadly, 499however, using genetics to infer pathogen sharing, rather than coarser phylogenetic scales (e.g., 500 species complexes or genera), is increasingly showing that many bacterial strains may be more 501host specific (Withenshaw, Devevey, Pedersen, & Fenton, 2016). The high specialism of bat 502 hemoplasma genotypes thus underscores the importance of using finer phylogenetic scales in the 503 study of infectious disease (Fountain-Jones et al., 2018; Graham, Storch, & Machac, 2018). 504 Comparative analyses of viruses have suggested that phylogenetically conserved 505 pathogen jumps between species may be a broader generality in the study of disease emergence 506 (Albery, Eskew, Ross, & Olival, 2019; Luis et al., 2015; Streicker et al., 2010). With few 507 exceptions, our results on hemoplasma genotype sharing between Neotropical bat species are 508 24 generally consistent with this pattern for a bacterial pathogen. Two cases in which hemoplasmas 509 were shared between more distantly related species included the VBG1 genotype in Desmodus 510 rotundus and Pteronotus fulvus (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae) and the EF1 genotype in 511 Glossophaga soricina and Saccopteryx bilineata (Phyllostomidae and Emballonuridae). For the 512 latter, both bat species co-roost in the LAR, which suggests an ecological context for pathogen 513 exposure over current timescales. However, other genetic markers (e.g., rpoB, rpoC, gyrB) 514 would be necessary to infer contemporary cross-species transmission (K\u00e4mpfer & Glaeser, 2012; 515 Volokhov et al., 2012), as analysis of the 16s rRNA gene alone is insufficient for hemoplasma 516 species identification (Volokhov et al., 2012). If hemoplasmas are more likely to specialize 517 rather than expand their range into new and unrelated species, genotype sharing between 518 unrelated bats could represent more transient spillovers (Bonneaud et al., 2019). As specialized 519 pathogens could be more transmissible than generalists (Garamszegi, 2006), species with high 520 infection prevalence of specialist genotypes could be prioritized for bacterial surveillance. 521 In conclusion, our analysis of a diverse community of bats and their pathogen genotypes 522 identifies several key ecological and evolutionary factors structuring bacterial infection within 523 and between species and provides a starting point for contrasts with such patterns for viruses. 524 Similar to bat viruses, we found moderate phylogenetic signal in hemoplasma prevalence. 525 However, these phylogenetic patterns in prevalence were decoupled from those describing bat 526 species centrality in sharing hemoplasmas, such that genotype sharing was generally restricted 527 by bat phylogeny. These findings imply codivergence of bats and their bacterial pathogens 528 alongside rare and phylogenetically constrained host shifts.

This result was weakly sensitive to overrepresentation by Desmodus rotundus, as 333 effect size and the prevalence sex difference was weaker when we randomly subsampled this 334 species(Fig. 2). Across all models, fixed effects only explained up to 7% of the modeled 335 variance, suggesting more variation explained by the species and phylogeny random effects. 336Similarly, phylogenetic factorization identified one bat clade with significantly lower prevalence 341 compared to the paraphyletic remainder: the Emballonuridae (12% infected;Fig. 3A). Our trait-342 based analysis showed that relatively larger species (\u03b2=1.48, p=0.01, R 2 =0.24) and those with 343 larger colonies (\u03b2=0.67, p=0.06, R 2 =0.20) had higher prevalence (Fig. 3B; Table 1).

However, PACo also demonstrated that only 56% of the 41 unique 373 bat-hemoplasma links displayed significant evidence of coevolution(Fig. S5), and these patterns 374 were almost exclusively found within the Phyllostomidae (with the exception of Saccopteryx 375 bilineata and its Mycoplasma muris-like bacterial genotype). The other 18 bat-hemoplasma 376 links therefore displayed evidence of phylogenetic incongruence and thus likely host shifts. 377Hemoplasma genotype sharing networks 379Within our bat-hemoplasma network, genotype sharing was restricted to five host communities, 380",
