During this phase of early adoption of telemedicine, we hypothesized that we would observe both potentially warranted variation in use of telemedicine (e.g., variation associated with geographic variables) and potentially unwarranted variation in use of telemedicine (e.g., variation associated with child race or ethnicity).",

We also observed that the association between subspecialist visit rates and child geographic and non-geographic characteristics varied when cared for by telemedicine-using versus non-using subspecialists. Children in rural counties and children living at distance to care are often identified implicitly or explicitly as the target audience for telemedicine programs and policies. Our findings indicate that among subspecialists who use telemedicine, telemedicine is more likely to be used for visits with the children for whom current policies have directed its use, as expected. Adjusted visit rates were substantially higher for children living >90 minutes from the subspecialist cared for by a telemedicine-using subspecialist rather than a telemedicine non-using subspecialist. This finding indicates that telemedicine availability improves likelihood of ongoing care for children at greatest distance. However, when adjusted for distance, rural designation did not have quite as straightforward of a relationship with visit frequency. Compared to telemedicine non-using subspecialists, matched patients of telemedicine-using subspecialists had slightly higher visit rates among children in smaller metropolitan communities, but minimal increase in visit rates among children in the most rural communities. One possible contributing factor to this finding may be that some telemedicine programs are directed primarily at specific telemedicine facilities due to insurer payment policies. Use of telemedicine facilities also allows may have clinical benefits by incorporating peripheral devices (e.g., tele-otoscope), nurse tele-presenters, and access to laboratory facilities. However, if telemedicine facilities are intentionally located with an eye to adequate volume, this could also result in the finding that the near-rural rather than the real-rural may see more benefit.",

Among children cared for by telemedicine-using subspecialists, children identified as Hispanic were less likely to receive a telemedicine visit. Additionally, differences in visit rates were wider for Black versus white children cared for by telemedicine-using subspecialists compared to matched Black and white children cared for by telemedicine non-using subspecialists. Because telemedicine policy has been designed to reach rural populations, it has the potential to exacerbate racial or ethnic disparities in areas or states where minority populations are predominantly urban. Additionally, restricting telemedicine use to beneficiaries living at specific distances does not address transportation barriers facing many urban Medicaid beneficiaries, including lack of a personal vehicle, indirect bus lines, multiple family obligations, and time constraints which can make traveling even within urban areas a formidable task. As noted previously, when regional telemedicine is delivered primarily at specific telemedicine facilities, where these facilities are located could also have implications for access by race and ethnicity. Additionally, clinician decision-making may also contribute to racial/ethnic disparities. For example, subspecialists may be less likely to offer telemedicine if a caregiver has low English proficiency if interpreter services are not adequately integrated. It is worth noting, however, that with intentional, community-partnered design, telehealth services can achieve high uptake and satisfaction even among families facing language barriers.29\n",

We noted that surgical subspecialists and non-pediatric trained subspecialists were less likely to have ever used telemedicine, but that the likelihood of a child receiving a telemedicine visits, conditional on receiving care from a telemedicine-using subspecialist, was increased for more recently trained, surgical, and non-pediatric subspecialists. These results suggest that there is a larger group of pediatric medical subspecialists who have used telemedicine at least once, but a smaller group of non-pediatric or surgical specialists who are more likely to use telemedicine for a given clinical encounters. These results suggest that factors influencing likelihood of any use telemedicine do not necessarily translate into increased likelihood of using telemedicine for an individual child, and that supporting initial adoption by an individual clinician is not adequate to promote regular use with patients.",

These findings have implications for telemedicine policy, where state-specific Medicaid restrictions abounded prior to and even into the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2018, 6 state Medicaid programs still placed geographic restrictions on which beneficiaries can receive telemedicine (e.g., greater than 60-minute travel time), 23 state Medicaid programs required that patients receiving telemedicine must be physically located at a designated facility, 16 allow schools to serve as the originating site for telemedicine visits and only 14 state Medicaid programs specifically allow telemedicine visits to occur with the patient at home.17 Each of these restrictions limit opportunities for telemedicine use, and prioritize the transportation barriers experienced by rural populations over the transportation barriers experienced by urban populations. Reducing these restrictions, as is being done during the COVID-19 pandemic, could allow telemedicine to be used more broadly for families facing a range of transportation, logistic, and time barriers, potentially enhancing both overall use and equity in use. Of note, because some argue that removing geographic restrictions to telemedicine may result in over-use of services, ongoing evaluation of policy impact is necessary. Alignment of clinician payment and incentives with high-value telemedicine use (e.g., accountable care organization models as opposed to fee-for-service models) may be a way to promote judicious use among clinicians as geographic restrictions are removed. Additionally, given the low overall use, state Medicaid programs wishing to overcome access barriers may also wish to consider alternative types of telemedicine (e.g., remote patient monitoring or store-and-forward electronic consultations30), which further reduce barriers by avoiding the need for a real-time visit, but are less frequently covered in state Medicaid programs.17 Many state Medicaid programs have altered these restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be important to assess the impact on equity of access and utilization as policies continue to evolve.",

            "text": "Key limitations of this analysis warrant comment. First, in this claims analysis, we lack clinical data to identify unmet need for subspecialty care. Instead we highlight variation in use of telemedicine among children receiving subspecialty care and among children receiving subspecialty care from a telemedicine-using subspecialist. We recognize that individual children with specific clinical needs may require different frequency of visits. Second, this claims analysis did not assess the quality of care delivered during telemedicine visits, focusing instead on questions of utilization. Third, our data were limited to Medicaid claims, such that we cannot assess subspecialist care patterns for children with commercial insurance. We may under-estimate total telemedicine use as we do not capture grant-funded programs or telemedicine payments by other insurers. Fourth, our analysis is cross-sectional. Longitudinal analysis of the impact of telemedicine adoption on visit patterns would provide additional insight to the relationship between new adoption, access, and utilization. Fifth, we recognize that we included data from states with different regulatory environments. To account for variation in overall telemedicine use by state, we used state-level random-effects and state-level matching in our analyses; between-state variation in use of telemedicine for pediatric subspecialty care should be assessed in future work. Finally, we note that these data are from 2014, and telemedicine use and regulations continue to evolve. Thus these data do not reflect the current state of telemedicine use, but rather offer insight into patterns of early adoption of telemedicine for pediatric subspecialty care and opportunities to continue to center equity in future evaluations of telemedicine policy.",

Within panels cared for by telemedicine-using subspecialists, children in smaller metropolitan counties and at distance to care had increased subspecialist visit rates, but geographic and sociodemographic variation in visit rates persisted. Evolving telemedicine policy, both during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, should be evaluated on its ability to improve equity in access and utilization for pediatric Medicaid beneficiaries in need of subspecialty care.",
