We identified steroid use of \u22651 mg/kg before diagnosis, low lymphocyte count, and onset of HMPV infection during the first month after HCT as important risk factors for progression. As shown in Figure 3, 60% of the patients with steroid use of \u22651 mg/kg or with low lymphocyte count had progression. These 2 characteristics are generally associated with high mortality after LRD by respiratory virus [10, 16, 20]. The logistic regression model provided additional insights. Lymphopenia was important but lost significance when the timing after transplantation was included. This suggests that other host defense mechanisms in the early time period after transplantation, such as monocytes, are also important. With only 30 events of LRD, we were unable to fit a model including all factors that are potentially important.",

Our study identified high-risk clinical situations during which early intervention strategies could be studied. To date, there is no proven effective treatment for HMPV infection [22, 23]. Several small reports support the use of ribavirin with or without intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for HMPV infection [24\u201327]. A larger study, however, showed no protective effect of ribavirin for HMPV LRD [10]. All studies were nonrandomized. In our study, a maintenance dose of IVIG was not associated with a lower progression rate (data not shown). We were unable to analyze the effect of ribavirin or high-dose IVIG because the number of patients who received it before progression was low. Based on our finding, reduction of steroid doses if patients receive high-dose steroid may be a possible strategy. However, whether such an approach would be effective cannot be determined from this study.",

As for the effect of viral load, we may have failed to show the relationship due to issues related to host immune function, which we did not quantify in this study. We generally perform nasopharyngeal testing when patients have URI symptoms. Although URI symptoms are based on host immune response, the level of the immune response in HCT recipients may not be correlated to viral load. Another possible reason is that progression to pneumonia may not be related to viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Previous studies of parainfluenza virus or pathogens detected in patients with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after HCT failed to show an association of viral load in a BAL sample with the level of lung injury or outcome, which is consistent with the finding in the current study [16, 28]. Although we did not demonstrate a correlation between viral load and progression to LRD, it is possible that larger studies with standardized BAL viral load measurements that control for dilution may improve our understanding of the role of viral load in disease progression.",

Although this cohort represents the largest number of HCT recipients infected with HMPV who received a quantitative virological workup of both the upper and lower respiratory tract samples, the sample size was too small to definitively assess all the patient characteristics we studied and the role of individual copathogens. We also did not have enough events for multivariable analyses. Nevertheless, we were able to perform several different bivariate Cox models. Another limitation is the long observation period, during which various transplantation procedures have changed. Low lymphocyte count or steroid dose before diagnosis are important factors for progression to LRD. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens that are related to mild lymphocytopenia are frequently used. Our center has recently adopted lower dose of steroids for the initial treatment of acute graft-vs-host disease [29], which may have affected the incidence of LRD in recent years. Although we included possible factors affecting the progression rate in the analyses, we may have missed some important factors that changed during the study period. The main methods to detect HMPV also changed because of the long observation period. However, there was no apparent bias in the way samples were collected for testing. We performed bronchoscopy when patients had lower respiratory tract symptoms and radiographic abnormalities. Nevertheless, the final decision was left to the attending physician. Therefore, an aggressive workup was declined in some \u201cpossible LRD\u201d cases, especially in cases late after HCT, which may have resulted in underreporting of progression to LRD in some cases. The virological analyses were also limited because of inconsistent surveillance of viral shedding and incomplete ascertainment of viral load by dilution factor of the nasal wash samples, although a previous study suggested that the dilution effect is rather limited [13].",
