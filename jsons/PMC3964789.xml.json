Rapid, accurate diagnostic tests for influenza can direct efforts for appropriate treatment of infected individuals and public health measures to prevent spread. For example, identification and isolation of infected individuals has been shown to prevent disease and be cost effective in the setting of pediatric hospitals and nursing homes (Salgado et al., 2002). It is important to note that viral shedding occurs before symptoms appear, and asymptomatic individuals are an important source of infection. Tests which identify such carriers would be very beneficial. Thus, early detection of virus infection in human and animals is of great importance.",

Hemagglutinin is a surface protein on various viral species that can bind to sialic acid on targeted cell surface (Sauter et al., 1992). The binding of viral proteins to sialic acid has been studied for different pathogenic viruses, such as influenza virus (Sauter et al., 1992, Varghese et al., 1997, Weis et al., 1988), human parainfluenza virus (Suzuki et al., 2001), human coronavirus (Vlasak et al., 1988, Kunkel and Herrler, 1993) and a specific serotype of rhinovirus (Uncapher et al., 1991). Based on the binding capability of sialic acid to certain viruses, it is possible to design a colorimetric sensor for detecting virus using self-reporting plasmonic nanoparticles, which display plasmon shift upon binding to viral particles. Such a quick and user-friendly detection method based on the binding between the influenza virus envelope protein hemagglutinin and sialic acid that is capable of effectively identifying individuals or animals infected with virus can help with early therapeutic intervention and reduce the spread of infection.",

The assembly of metallic nanoparticles usually results in a red shift of the plasmonic peak and has been well adopted into various detection schemes with specific targeting elements displayed on the nanoparticle surface for many targets, such as polynucleotides (Elghanian et al., 1997, Storhoff et al., 2004), enzymes (Pavlov et al., 2004), cells (Medley et al., 2008), and heavy metals (Darbha et al., 2008). Still, there have yet to be reported for actual virus detection. Herein we report the development of sialic acid stabilized gold nanoparticles (SA-AuNPs) through a simple one-pot synthesis and their use in the detection of two influenza virus type B, subtypes Victoria and Yamagata. In our method, sialic acid was used without any chemical modification which is often time consuming and costly, such as previously reported sialic acid functionalized gold nanoparticles (Niikura et al., 2009, Papp et al., 2010).",

It is known that the carboxylic group of SA is critical for the binding of hemagglutinin on the viral particles to SA on the surface of cells (Wang et al., 2007). Most of the hydroxyl and amine groups of SA-AuNPs are located at the opposite end to the carboxylic group. It is reasonable to project that the carboxylic group will face outward after SA-AuNPs are formed. The SA layer on AuNP surface prevents the aggregation of the AuNPs in solution. In the presence of viral particles, single AuNPs can attach to hemagglutinin on viral particle surface, resulting in shorter distance between AuNPs. It is expected that interaction among AuNPs would lead to a change in the absorption spectra, thus signaling the presence of viral particles.",

The increased absorbance at 600\u2013610 nm indicates that AuNP aggregates have formed, thus decreasing the population of single AuNPs as they are converted into AuNP aggregate on the viral particle surface.

A solution containing 0.2 nM SA-AuNPs and 5 vol% of the medium was prepared and absorption spectrum was measured after 20 min (\nFig. 4A). Since the absorption spectrum of the medium overlaps somewhat with the plasmonic peak area of SA-AuNPs, absorption spectrum of the medium was subtracted from that of the SA-AuNPs and medium mixture (Fig. 4A, dotted line). The corrected absorption spectrum of the SA-AuNPs in media matched well with that of SA-AuNPs in water, indicating that the presence of medium does not cause SA-AuNP aggregation. Additionally, the potential for virus binding nonspecifically to nanoparticles and cause aggregation was tested. Gelatin-AuNPs, with similar spherical shape and size distribution (Fig. 4B inset, diameter of \u223c20 nm by TEM analysis) but lacking sialic acid were assayed for aggregation in the presence of viral particles. No change was observed in either the plasmonic band or the 600\u2013700 nm region.

At higher concentrations of virus (e.g. 2.5and 5 vol%), as ratio of virus to particles increases, the proportion of SA-AuNPs that can be bound to the same viral particle decreases. This results in longer interparticle distance between neighboring SA-AuNPs on the viral particle surface, and less signal. We carried out another set of colorimetric tests using a higher concentration of SA-AuNP solution (0.8 nM), while maintaining the same concentrations of virus solution. The results in Fig. 6E show that the linear range of \u0394OD vs. concentration of added virus solution has extended to 2.5 vol% of virus in the solution. This illustrates the importance of having an excessive amount of SA-AuNPs in the starting solution when applying this scheme for virus detection. To validate these results with another virus preparation, influenza B/Yamagata subtype was also tested with 0.4 nM SA-AuNPs solution.
