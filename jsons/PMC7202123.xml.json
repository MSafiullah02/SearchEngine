Emerging evidence suggests that airborne transmission is possible. Inconsistent recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have caused confusion among health care providers regarding the appropriate level of precaution. CDC recommends airborne precautions when caring for any patient with known or suspected COVID-19,1 whereas WHO recommends standard (contact) and droplet precautions for the care of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients, and airborne precautions only for aerosol-generating procedures.2",

In the absence of widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2, it is reasonable to suspect a large proportion of individuals with cases are undiagnosed. Furthermore, false-negative tests resulting from limitations of sample collection and kit performance3,4 may misspecify a patient as negative when they are truly at risk of transmitting virus. Pre- or asymptomatic infection could be an important source of transmission to others, with symptoms of COVID-19 appearing a median of 5days after exposure with likely transmission during the prodromal phase.5 In fact, asymptomatic infection may account for over half of onward transmission.6,7 Moreover, nonspecific symptoms means that patients may present for management of nonrespiratory symptoms (such as diarrhea8 or nausea8) and thus would not necessarily be a suspected COVID-19 case.",

First, short-range aerosol transmission is an important mode of transmission for other respiratory viruses that share similar characteristics with SARS-CoV-2. These viruses include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),9 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS),10 and influenza A virus.11 Seasonal human coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, HKU1) also have the potential for aerosol transmission. In a recent study, viral RNA for seasonal human coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses was found in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness.12 It is thus reasonable to suspect aerosol transmission is also possible for SARS-CoV-2.",

However, the demand for N95 respirators has already outpaced their availability.18 As such, anesthesiologists and other health care providers may find themselves without appropriate airborne protection during emergent surgery or contact with a patient. To ensure the safety of anesthesia providers, an N95 (or equivalent such as FFP2) respirator should be the minimum requirement for direct contact patient care. To conserve respirators, the CDC has recommended approaches for extended use and limited reuse of respirators.19 CDC has also recommended broader hospital-based practices to conserve respirators for those at highest risk of coming into contact with COVID-19\u2013positive patients.19 It is imperative that international, national, and local authorities make every possible effort to greatly increase the supply of respirator masks and develop efficient workflows to maximize the respirators currently available.",
