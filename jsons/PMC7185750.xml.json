Only in recent decades have disease characteristics been considered as the product of selection through a co-evolutionary arms-race between parasites and host immune defences [1]. Many studies have highlighted the role of the host population structure as a selection pressure for parasites; arguing that it may have an impact on pathogen virulence [2], [3] or infectious period [4], as well as the impact of parasitism on the evolution of host life-history traits [5], [6]. Even if these studies have \u2018opened a new chapter\u2019 in the field of infectious diseases, they remain mainly theoretical and very few have dealt with real systems (but see [7], [8], [9]). The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) provides an interesting host model because this species carries a large diversity of well studied viruses, and ecological and genetic research has shown that the species exhibits great intra-specific variability in terms of population structures.",

[10], when cats were attracted to rodents infesting the grain stores of the first farming communities. Since then, the domestic cat has been particularly invasive and has colonised all continents and many islands. An extraordinary behavioural flexibility permits cats to adapt to a large ecological diversity and to exploit different resources. Depending on their location and the rural versus urban environment, cats form groups of varying size characterised by different spatial and social structures, different mating systems [11], [12], and also different genetic structures as exemplified by coat colours [13].",

More precisely, how do viruses respond to the constraint imposed by cat population features in a given environment? What may be the expected consequences of changes in cat population structures on the evolution of viruses? On the other hand, how do viruses alter host fitness traits? Interestingly, some feline infectious diseases share features with human infectious diseases, e.g., FIV is an animal model of HIV [20] and the strong antigenic and clinical diversity of feline calicivirus is similar to that of human noroviruses [21]. A better understanding of evolutionary mechanisms of host-parasite interactions acquired from the cat-virus system may then be extended, by analogy, to humans.",

Whatever their route of transmission, these viruses are all very efficiently transmitted in cat colonies owing to the close proximity and high social contact rates among individuals, and the communal rearing of kittens by females [28], [29], [30]. Accordingly, a high prevalence of FHV, FCV and FPV occur in urban cat populations because of their higher densities and much higher social contact rates compared to rural ones [31].",

In natural cat populations, FIV is practically solely transmitted by biting [32], [34], [35], [36], which frequently occurs when males fight and during coitus when the males bite females at the neck. As a result, males are more often infected in rural populations where a polygynous mating system gives rise to more fights [34].

For some viruses such as FPV [41] and FCV [42], infected cats mount an immune response and get rid of the virus. In such conditions, the susceptible pool is quickly depleted before the birth of new susceptible individuals and these viruses should disappear from the local cat population. This strategy favours quick disease transmission, but exposes viruses to a higher risk of extinction, so their persistence relies on additional strategies. FPV is excreted in large amounts in the faeces and the virus remains infectious for months in the contaminated environment [43], from where it can infect subsequent susceptible generations [44]. In addition, the DNA parvovirus of carnivores can cross the species barrier, specifically between cats and dogs, two species living in close proximity [45], [46], [47]. This is due to its especially high mutation rate, which is closer to that of RNA viruses than to that of DNA viruses [46]. Therefore, dogs may act as a reservoir that allows the virus to persist when the number of susceptible cats would be insufficient. The genetic variability of FCV, a RNA virus, is associated with a strong antigenic diversity. This could explain the ability of the virus to escape the host immune response, which contributes to the persistence of the virus in the cat population. The continuity of FCV transmission relies also on some chronically infected cats shedding the virus over prolonged periods of time (up to several months, [30]).",

FIV induces a chronic infection, as is also the case for FCoV in some individuals. Chronically infected individuals shed the virus over long periods [28], ensuring its long-term persistence in cat populations. Like all retroviruses, FeLV and FIV integrate into the host genome as a provirus that will persist in the infected cell until it dies and, thereby, can establish \u201clatent\u201d infections [49], [50].

[34] showed that dominant males represent a core-group [53] for FIV; that is, a group of individuals that contributes disproportionately to pathogen transmission within, but also between, populations. Actually, males can roam over very long distances during the reproductive season in search of receptive females and frequently get involved in fights [11]. These males are important targets for viruses that must spread between sub-populations in order to survive. This may explain why FIV is primarily transmitted through bites [39], out of all the possible modes of transmission (e.g., sexual, or vertical in-utero or in-lacto) reported experimentally [54], [55]. These results may clarify the apparent paradox of FIV in that it exhibits an endemic pattern in rural cat populations despite its low prevalence, relying on a small number of at-risk individuals. However, this strategy is ineffective in the urban environment where fights and overall male dispersion are almost non-existent [24], [56]. This urban social organisation is recent for the cat-FIV system in an evolutionary time-scale. So is FIV adapted to the urban context? If so, one would expect selection for a new mode of transmission and the emergence of more \u2018fit\u2019 viral strains adapted to the new social structure of cats generated by the urban environment.",

            "text": "Due to their higher aggressiveness, both male and female orange cats (that are almost exclusively present in rural populations) are more heavily infected by FIV than other cats [57]. This is probably because orange males fight more and because there is a greater tendency for males to bite orange females during coitus because orange females struggle more. A curiosity is the greater sexual polymorphism of orange cats compared to non-orange individuals: orange males are heavier than non-orange males, whereas orange females are lighter than other females [57]. Due to their lighter body size, orange females reproduce earlier than non-orange ones but devote less energy resources to reproduction [23], [57], whereas orange males, because of their greater body size, monopolise receptive females earlier and more easily than other congeners in the polygynous mating system [12], [57]. A possible explanation of these different mating strategies between genotypes may be the differential impact of FIV on colour morphs. According to life history theory, early reproduction could balance the survival costs due to FIV. Since heavier males have an advantage over lighter males during conflicts, orange males with the highest growth rates may be selected for. In contrast, early reproduction in orange females may have arisen from selection for reduced size in order to attain sexual maturity earlier. This may explain the differing evolution of body mass in male and female orange cats. Overall, these results suggest that microparasites may play a role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism in mammals [57].",

However, the model is quite sensitive to the values of some parameters and so, requires restrictive conditions for the long-term persistence of the polymorphism between orange and non-orange cats. Firstly, the fitness advantage of orange cats in populations free from FIV must be small. Typically it must be around half of the reduction in the life expectancy induced by FIV (which is lower than 10% in natural conditions, Avril, Devillard, Pontier, unpublished results). Secondly, orange cats must have around ten times more at-risk contacts than non-orange ones, and certainly not less than five times more.

A typical example of such a change is vaccination. Vaccines are widely used in both human and animal medicine and are certainly one of the greatest medical successes of the last century. Efficient vaccines exist for many cat viruses, such as FeLV, FCV, FPV and rabies. It was estimated about fifteen years ago that at most 20% of cat populations were vaccinated in rural areas in France [23]. Moreover, some cat viruses pose a serious threat to other wild species like FPV and FeLV for free-ranging Florida panthers Puma concolor coryi\n[59]. Cross-species transmission may be restricted by reducing the number of infected cats by vaccination. While vaccines protect inoculated individuals from developing diseases, their effects go beyond that of the individual. Vaccinated individuals are less susceptible or not susceptible at all, to infection, which alters the structure of at-risk contacts in the host population. Vaccines have thus indirect consequences even in non-vaccinated individuals.",

This mechanism is known as herd immunity [60] and is largely used to estimate the adequate proportion of a population requiring vaccination in order to stop disease spread. At the extreme, mass vaccination can, in theory, eradicate diseases [60], although in practice eradication has only been attained for smallpox in humans. In fragmented host populations, such as cat populations, vaccines make the persistence of parasites more difficult. As a result, we can expect that the widespread use of vaccines will force parasites to evolve persistence strategies (see above), e.g., by inducing more prolonged diseases. According to the trade-off hypothesis [61], the duration of a parasite-induced disease is inversely correlated with its virulence. Mass vaccination could select for less virulent strains in non-vaccinated individuals.",

With some vaccines the parasite can still spread in vaccinated hosts under the condition that it boosts its reproductive rate to overcome the host immune response. This could select for strains that replicate more rapidly within the host and, thus, are more virulent in non-vaccinated individuals [62]. As another example of a potential negative effect, Aguas et al. [63] argue that a reduction in exposure to pathogens may prevent the regular mild re-infections that are necessary to maintain efficient immune defences, leaving more individuals unprotected.

These interactions can also be beneficial for the host, for example, the interaction between HIV and GB virus C [68]. Interactions between parasites occur in many species [66] and it would not be surprising that they also occur in cats.
