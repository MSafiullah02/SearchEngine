To enable a rapid response to a potential outbreak, it is desirable to have fast, accurate and comprehensive diagnostic methods that are capable of detecting simultaneously and subtyping viruses. However, it is very expensive to use virus specific PCR assays. Several groups have developed multiplex RT-PCRs to identify respiratory viruses in clinical samples (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Bharaj et al., 2009, Brittain-Long et al., 2010, Coiras et al., 2004, Gunson et al., 2005, Jansen et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2007, Mahony et al., 2007, Pabbaraju et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2009). The preference of one test over the other depends on its specificity, sensitivity and turnaround time as well as cost in resource limited settings.",

Conserved regions of target genes were chosen to design the forward and reverse primers. For mRT-PCR, different viral genes with their PCR product sizes are given in Table 1\n. Primer sequences can be provided on request. The above mRT-PCR primers were obtained from Sigma (Bangalore, India). Multiplex RT PCRs were carried out in 3 tubes (sets) (set 1: influenza A, subtype seasonal H1, H3 and pandemic H1 (2009), influenza B; set 2: RSV-A, RSV-B, HMPV, PIV-1, -2, -3; and set 3: PIV-4, corona virus OC43/HKU1, corona virus 229E/NL63, rhinovirus/enterovirus). The mRT-PCR did not differentiate between corona virus OC43 and HKU1; 229E and NL63; and between rhinovirus and enterovirus. Monoplex one step real time RT PCRs (rRT-PCR) for influenza A, subtype seasonal H1, H3, pandemic H1 (2009), influenza B and internal control RnaseP were carried out as per protocol provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA (CDC) (CDC protocol, 2009). For RSV-A and B, PIV-1, -2, -3, corona virus OC43, 229E, NL63 and rhinovirus, the rRT-PCR assay was performed as described (Gunson et al., 2005), for HMPV (Maertzdorf et al., 2004) and for PIV-4 as described on the following website www3.appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/mcb/cms_088565.pdf. For rRT-PCR, all influenza, RSV-A, rhinovirus, PIV-1, and coronavirus NL63 TaqMan probes were labelled with FAM (fluorescein amidite); RSV-B, PIV-2, -3, -4, coronavirus OC43 and 229E were labelled with VIC.

Further, RNA was purified using Qiagen's RNA extraction kit and estimated using the Nanoplex nanophotometer. RNA copy number was calculated and 10 fold serial dilutions of the in vitro RNA were performed. Copy number referred to the number of copies of the target gene used to ascertain the limit of detection of the assay. The concentrations tested for each target in set 1 were 106 to 10 copies and in sets 2 and 3 were 107 copies to 1 copy of template RNA per reaction. The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the lowest concentration at which each target could be detected consistently. PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis. Positive controls were prepared by pooling in vitro RNA of each set.",

Several cases of co-infection were detected using both the PCR methods. Multiplex RT-PCR detected 41 (4.9%) samples with co-infection including 3 samples in which 3 viruses were detected whereas rRT-PCR detected 20 (2.4%) samples with co-infection. One case of co-infection with influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses was also detected. Co-infection with different influenza viruses occurs naturally and plays an important role in evolution, epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus.",

Lower detection rates by rRT-PCR were due to the lower sensitivity of this system for rhinovirus and HMPV. This may be due to sequence variation in primer probe binding regions in Indian subtypes. Frequency of PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-4 and coronavirus was low; a larger number of samples are required to better assess their clinical sensitivity and specificity.",
