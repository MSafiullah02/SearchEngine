Genes encoding the structural proteins are located downstream; these include the spike (S) glycoprotein responsible for virus entry, the small envelope (E) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is associated with the viral RNA. The rest of the ORFs encode unknown or less-characterised non-structural proteins. The genome of FCoVs and CCoVs includes two gene clusters encoding non-structural proteins, the ORFs 3a, 3b, 3c (located between the S and E genes) and the ORFs 7a, 7b (downstream of the N gene). These genes are not essential for virus propagation in cell culture but are important in virulence or viral tropism (Chang et al., 2010, Vaughn et al., 1995).",

CCoV-I strains were identified in the beginning of the 2000s and were initially designated as FCoV-like strains due to their high sequence homology within the S gene of FCoV-I (Pratelli et al., 2003a, Pratelli et al., 2003b). Lately, an additional ORF, named ORF3, that has not been detected in CCoV type II and other alphacoronaviruses, has been identified in CCoV-I. ORF3 is placed downstream of the S gene and encodes a non-structural glycoprotein of unknown function (Lorusso et al., 2008).",

RT-PCR assays were carried out using the OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Briefly, the RNA was reverse transcribed at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min and then amplified by 40 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min of primer annealing at 50 \u00b0C and 1 min of primer extension at 72 \u00b0C.

The N sequences clustered into two main clades (Fig. 1\n).

By sequence analysis of fragments from the M and S genes, Benetka et al. suggested that interspecies transmission of CoVs occurred in a shelter where cats and dogs were in contact.

Most of the FCoV strains were identified as FCoV-I with the N and S genes clustering with reference FCoV-I strains. Surprisingly, the N sequences from six strains recovered from Cats -9, -22, -29, -30, -163 and 179 clustered within the CCoV-I genotype whereas the spike gene of 4 of them (Cats -22, -29, -30 and 163) segregated within the FCoV-I genotype. One significant element is the presence of the accessory ORF3 gene in these atypical FCoV strains, as this gene was described to be peculiar to CCoV-I strains (Lorusso et al., 2008). Lorusso et al. hypothesised that, CCoV-I may have acquired the ORF3 gene after the divergence of FCoV-I and CCoV-I from their common ancestor, or, alternatively that FCoV-I may have lost the ORF3 gene present in the common parental virus. However, the description of atypical FCoV-I strains harbouring ORF3 gene led to the hypothesis that the ORF3 gene also persisted in some FCoV-I or that these strains may originate from a recombination between FCoV-I and CCoV-I strains. In the present study, we identified one couple of cat and dog (Cat-22 and Dog-1) harbouring coronavirus and living together. Notably, Dog-1 was infected by a CCoV-I strain and Cat-22 by an atypical FCoV-I strain comprising an ORF3 gene. Moreover, strains infecting these animals shared 99% of nucleotide identity within the N gene, the ORF3 genes exhibited the same 29-nt deletion which yielded a stop codon but the S genes significatively differed. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the strain detected in Cat-22 originated from recombination with the CCoV-I strain from the Dog-1. However, without extensive sequence analysis of the full-length genome from some atypical FCoV-I harbouring an ORF3 gene, it would be impossible to clarify whether they originate or not from recombination with CCoV-I and to identify the putative recombination sites.",

Clarifications must be made upon whether these strains are widespread amongst the cat population and full-length genome sequencing will be required to deepen the the phylogenetic analysis. Given the dramatic consequences of SARS-CoV infection and more recently the new MERS-CoV, greater understanding of the molecular processes leading to the emergence of coronaviruses remains crucial (Zaki et al., 2012). In this context the surveillance of animal coronaviruses remains important not only because animal coronaviruses are often responsible of major veterinary diseases but also because the knowledge accumulated have a substantial contribution to the understanding of the genetic evolution and pathobiology of coronaviruses.",
