            "text": "The new coronavirus disease 2019 has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the peripheral airways. Coughing into a tissue or cloth even at home in order to absorb the emitted aerosol is highly recommended to avoid the continuous re-inhalation of own cough.",

The deposition probability in the extrathoracic airways is determined by an empirical deposition formula (16) .

Lindsey at al. measured the number size distributions of coughgenerated aerosol particles by means of a combined wide range aerosol particle spectrometer (optical particle counter and scanning mobility particle sizer system), when patients with influenza cough (18) . Although it is a different disease, the virus size as well as the mechanism of aerosol generation during dry cough is similar in case of COVID-19 and influenza, so we used these data. The mass size distribution was obtained from the concentration, number size distribution and density of coughgenerated particles. For the calculations we assumed, that the particles are spherical and their physical size is equal to their measured optical size. The mass size distribution is plotted in Figure 1 . The cough-generated particles may travel great distance if the meteorological conditions (air velocity, temperature, humidity) are favorable (19) . During the flight the particles may evaporate or fall down by gravitational settling. Therefore, the present simulations apply only to one of supposed major transmission routes, when a bystander subject (within a 1-m-distance) directly inhales the coughgenerated aerosol (4) . If the inhalation takes place more distant from the source in space or time, then the size distribution has to be measured near to the subject inhaling the emitted particles.",

Considering the average particle number concentration in the material coughed (29,600 dm -3 ), the tidal volume (0.75 dm 3 ), and the mean particle mass (4.6 pg), it can be calculated that a single inhalation results in 63 ng material depositing in the extrathoracic airways, while 5.6 ng and 8.6 ng deposit in the bronchial and acinar airways, respectively. In a subtler subdivision of the intrathoracic airways, one can distinguish peripheral airways (all acinar airways except the first four generations, i.e. the bronchiolus respiratorius region), small airways (with a diameter smaller than 2 mm except the peripheral airways), and large airways (with a diameter larger than 2 mm). Figure 3 shows the mass deposition fractions and deposited mass from a single inhalation in these airways. While 2.7 ng and 5.7 ng material deposit in the large and small airways, respectively, 5.8 ng reach the peripheral airways, and deposit there.

Figure 4 shows that in terms of deposited mass the most affected part of the acinar airways is the 19 th and 20 th airway generations, which means that most of the pathogens penetrating the extrathoracic airways will pass 19 bifurcations before depositing. In the bronchial region, the highest amount deposit in the 12 th airway generation. The acinar peak is more than three-fold higher than the bronchial one. However, the difference in deposition density is much smaller as the surface of the airways strongly increases with the generation number.

            "text": "The results suggest that inhalation of cough-generated aerosol containing SARS-CoV-2 results in only an upper airway infection directly, which can later develop into pneumonia. It is in agreement with the clinical observation that some patients who have mild symptoms initially will subsequently have precipitous clinical deterioration that occurs approximately one week after symptom onset (22, 23, 26) . It is also in agreement with a recent virological analysis of nine mild cases of COVID-19 providing proof of active replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in tissues of the upper respiratory tract (5). They found very high concentration of viral RNA in and isolated the virus itself from early throat swabs. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of virus concentrations in the upper airways SARS-CoV-2 would be much less dangerous. In another study, nasal epithelial cells were found to show the highest expression of ACE2 among all investigated cell types in the respiratory system (9) , which together with the deposition fraction synergistically increase the probability of upper respiratory infections.",

            "text": "From the throat where high virus concentration can be found in patients with mild symptoms (5), pathogens can be transported either via the cardiovascular or the respiratory system. As SARS-CoV-2 genome could not be detected in the blood of patients with mild symptoms (27) , transport via the respiratory system can be the dominant route. Potential mechanisms of virus transport from the throat to the lower airways may include re-inhalation of own cough, aerosol generation in the throat during inhalation by resuspension, pathogen transport on the surface of the bronchial airways, or gradual infection of neighboring cells expressing ACE2 towards the periphery. Mucociliary clearance can inhibit the latter two processes suggesting that compromised mucus production or transport can be a risk factor for COVID-19 pneumonia. Understanding the processes leading from infections of the upper airways to pneumonia in COVID-19 patients may help to identify early treatment and prevention strategies, and provide further insights on the long incubation period.",

It was found here that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is 10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. The one week difference observed in several patients between the onset of their initial mild symptoms and precipitous clinical deterioration (22, 23, 26) provides a precious window for prevention of pneumonia and ARDS by blocking or significantly",
