Although only one of those deaths was reported in the United States of America (USA), it sent the American media, the public, government officials and response agencies on high alert from September 30, 2014, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [11] confirmed the first Ebola case in the City of Dallas, Texas, USA. Three other cases were reported thereafter.",

However, less attention has been received from public administration and crisis management scholars. From the first confirmed case of the Ebola virus on September 30th, 2014 in Mr. Eric Duncan, a Liberian national visiting Dallas, Texas, various response agencies in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) Metropolitan region came under heavy scrutiny from the world. The likelihood of an American case escalating to an epidemic state and expectations of high mortality rates, made it so. Despite this attention there appears to be no research published to date on how emergency managers in the USA responded to this perceived transboundary health crisis and the adaptive learning and improvised decision making that resulted following the \u201ccommunication crisis chaos\u201d [20].",

First, it crosses geographical borders, threatening multiple cities, regions, countries and continents ----e.g. the Ebola virus which originated in West Africa and crossed international borders and reached the US. Second, it jumps functional boundaries ---e.g. the Ebola crisis affected not only health systems but safety and security systems, and the travel and tourism industry globally. Third, it transcends traditional time boundaries such that a clear beginning and ending cannot be pinpointed easily in time---e.g. the March 2014 Ebola outbreak declared as a PHEIC took over two years to clear globally.",

The response system (formal or informal) shapes individuals and organizations strategic actions to the extent that they adapt to the unintended consequences of actions that are performed by other agencies. Such an approach notes the challenges of emergency response by examining the conditions or circumstances under which first responders are likely to act/behave contrary to bureaucratic norms. Examining adaptive learning of first responders is important in explaining the value of emergency planning and standard operating procedures (SOPs) as well as improvised decision making and changes in governing procedures for crisis response.",

They aptly noted that, \u201cmodern emergency management presents a paradox.

They suggested encouraging improvisation and learning from it by using a computer based system to log all improvised decision-making in dealing with contingencies and using this to understand cognitive processes and mental models of team members to support training for better preparedness [27], [31], [28]. Morgan et al. [28] further emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the mental models or cognitive structures of both decision makers and the publics. Getting the priorities and uncertainties of both sides clarified will help streamline the risk communication process such that it is simple, meaningful and helpful to the public in making complex decisions.",

However relevant information collected from appropriate sources, needs to be verified and then shared with response agencies [21]. This requires effective coordination between multiple agencies to ensure resources are used wisely [23] and duplication of efforts are minimized. Smith [42] observed that public agencies typically adopt one of two crisis communication approaches for infectious diseases. Firstly, they issue warnings about what protective actions to take to reduce possible contact with the disease through regular screening, washing hands, wearing a mask, maintaining hygiene and disinfection. Secondly, for greater perceived threats they issue health warnings advising the public to restrict contact with those infected through quarantine measures, travel restrictions, or isolation of the infected person. Instituting these control measures and proper dissemination of such information is important to gain public trust and minimize fear, helplessness, and anxiety among the general public ([7], p.1488).",

The onset of a communicable disease has a profound effect on the public, leading to a heightened perceptions of risk especially if it is perceived as likely to spread quickly and result in high mortality rates. For example the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which spread rapidly from China to some 37 countries infected approximately 10,000 and killed around 1000. It demonstrated that when there is substantial scientific uncertainty about the cause of an outbreak, and the effectiveness of protective measures called to question, it creates widespread public anxiety ([42], pg.3115). This anxiety is further heightened when dreaded consequences are manufactured by the mass media leading to unwarranted public fear and loss of trust in government response mechanisms (pg. 3117).",

There is a need to ensure that as a crisis unfolds, not only failures but successes are noted and praised. Consistent with the social amplification of risk, where the process is amplified by the occurrence of risk-related events, the media has a tremendous role to play in framing crises appropriately and drawing the public, political and organizational leadership's attention to laudable efforts by first response personnel to help build and rebuild their confidence [26]. Furthermore, as noted by Rolison and Hanoch [38] in their study of US residents perceptions of the Ebola virus, those with greater knowledge of the virus perceived less risk of contracting the virus and were more serious about taking protective actions compared to those with lesser knowledge. Thus providing accurate, reliable and up to date information through multiple trustworthy sources (e.g. traditional media, the internet, general practitioners, friends and family members or others) to enhance residents knowledge as the crisis unfolds will be crucial [16], [37].",

            "text": "The Ebola crisis response suggests a need for further research in the areas of leadership as there was a variation in the perceived success of response by agencies at different levels of government. While some agencies perceived the CDC's response as slow and inadequate, others reported that the CDC did the best they could under the circumstances and were able to distribute guidance documents in a timely manner. On the other hand, leadership roles assumed at the local level were consistently applauded [45]. It would also be worthwhile to understand what styles of leadership are effective in transboundary crisis response with ever changing needs, calling for improvised decision making. Finally, understanding how agencies and the public at large measure or characterize effective response. Is it measured in the time of response or framing of the issue by the media or political interest etc. This will likely help inform responding agencies on how to manage their organizational reputation and performance in future crisis.",
