[3] This model was designed to inform COVID-19 pandemic capacity planning in acute care. Based on the region's population, the number of observed confirmed cases of COVID-19, and observed trajectories of case numbers, our model estimates the number of new cases of COVID-19 predicted to present to the ED for each day from March 6 to May 5, 2020. Cases are either sent home or admitted to hospital based on disease severity, and move through the acute care hospital system occupying ward or intensive care unit (ICU) beds, with or without invasive mechanical ventilation, based on probabilities derived from reported and observed data. We then estimated the number of suspected cases of COVID-19 (patients for whom PPE is required until COVID-19 infection is ruled out) by multiplying the projected number of confirmed cases by the ratio of confirmed to suspected cases currently reported to us by the Ontario Ministry of Health for patients in acute care (personal communication).",

The estimated daily patient touchpoint counts were refined via interviews (with hospital service managers, point-of-care nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians in critical care, general internal medicine, and the emergency department) and through direct observation at University Health Network and Sinai Health in Toronto, Canada. We identified that the use of N95 face masks was higher than expected based on PHO recommendations as a result of patient touchpoints for mechanically ventilated patients being cared for in the prone position. Patient care activities during patient proning, including turning to the prone position, turning back to the supine position, and the frequent head positioning changes, while not considered an AGMP by PHO, are considered potential AGMPs by local clinical leadership given the risk of ventilator circuit disconnection. [5] These care activities represented a significant source of N95 utilization. We adjusted our model to reflect this real-world practice. In the absence of high quality data to inform the probability of patients being proned, we assumed that 60% of mechanically ventilated patients were being proned based on the percentage of patients with a PaO2/FiO2 <150 mmHg reported in UK case series data. [6] We chose this PaO2/FiO2 threshold as it corresponds with both clinical guidelines for the care of patients with COVID-19 and clinical trial data. [5, 7] Research ethics approval was obtained from the University of Toronto covering access to provincial databases, and was waived by the research ethics board at Sinai Health System for patient touchpoint data collection.",

Our information-gathering activities to support this work revealed that PPE use guidelines varied between institutions, and while always based on healthcare worker safety, were influenced by factors including patient case volumes and local PPE stocks. We therefore chose to base our model on a non-restrictive model of PPE utilization. We argue that health systems should be planning their PPE needs based on non-restrictive, or \"worst-case\" estimates of PPE demand, in order to prevent both patient and health care worker morbidity and mortality.",

We are developing an online tool on our website (www.covid-19-mc.ca) to help health systems estimate the amount of PPE required if conservation strategies are deployed. Specifically, organizations will be able to predict their PPE needs based on their local health human workforce data and conservation strategy type.",

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released a PPE \"burn rate calculator\", but it is a static model based on institutional PPE use and is neither informed by epidemiologic data nor patient and healthcare worker specific data. [8] We caution against estimating PPE demand based on so called \"burn rates\", as many institutions have already depleted PPE stocks, and may be implementing conservation strategies such as reuse of masks or restricted distribution in an attempt to conserve supplies. Planning based on historical use may significantly underestimate true PPE needs-especially if case volumes rise-and may lead to inaccurate assumptions regarding future PPE needs that are insufficient to meet the needs of protecting healthcare workers.",
