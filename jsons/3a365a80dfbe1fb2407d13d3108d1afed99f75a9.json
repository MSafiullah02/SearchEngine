The basic concept of ST concerns about two combined dimensions of analyzing: time and space. For prediction of disease outbreak, we attempt to locate any potential uninfected by the predicted virus prevalence. A popular ST-clustering software called \"SaTScan\" works by predicting the next likely infested areas by considering the history records of infested zones and the radius of the zone. However, it is argued that using radius as a spatial measure suits large and perhaps evenly populated area. In urban city, the population density is relatively high and uneven. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, by following the concept of SaTScan, but in consideration of spatial information in relation to local populations and full demographic information in proximity (e.g. that of a street or a cluster of buildings). This higher resolution of ST data mining has an advantage of precision and applicability in some very compact urban cities. For proving the concept a computer simulation model is presented that is based on empirical but anonymized and processed data.",

There are research papers which advocate developing the clinical decision support system which predicts the time series and space area. However, the efficacy of clinical decision support system is based on the underlying analysis model. Some data related challenges are like: what kind of data attributes the system need to use? How about the scope of data? Is the data useful or not? Which analyzing method is efficient and effective? Any other parameter need to be concerned? What is the trend of disease outbreak? Etc. Many researchers suggested embedding the clinical decision support system into the GIS (Geographic Information System) as it seems to be more accurate to detect the area whether is in a high prevalence rate and their adjacency areas [1] , or even using the ST analyzing method to focus on the analyzing risk of the disease outbreak [2] . Actually these research papers assume the field of analysis is of large terrain or vast piece of land. It is useful for large countries. However, it may not be so applicable for compact urban cities like Macao, Hong Kong, Taipei etc. where the human population is very dense, but they are not necessarily evenly distributed. In the words, the radius approach might not work well in estimating the next infested areas. Different from the other researchers, we introduce a new and simple approach by dividing the city into respective regular polygons, each polygon which is square cell as assumed in this case, is of equal size; and they form grid over the coverage of the city regardless what shape the city is. The number of the square cells to be defined can be selected arbitrarily by the user that depends on the land area and the resolution required.",

This analyzing method will be novel as the part of risk evaluation for detecting among various areas, especially when the forecast of the disease outbreak is changing obviously, the risk index and the associated relationship can reflect the status of the virus extension.

Many researchers issue various ideas and conducting experiments about it, for their report they are more concerning the serious disease outbreak occurred in a big country, different formulas and external factors like the demographic information, natural disaster like hazard, exposure and vulnerability [11] . As abovementioned, the direction of the ST analyzing is inclined towards the geographic information with the polygon pattern as the original GIS of the country. In fact, it will be bias as the virus extension should not only be analyzing the geographic framework like the predefined map, may be the serious outbreak area is in the edge of the various regions.

In average there are at least 37,198 tourists stay in Macao every day. Such numbers are approximately divided into different areas in the grid model. The objective is by conducting an experiment for the enterovirus surveillance, to predict the likely areas to be infested in the near future. Refer to the infected case of various areas in referenced period and its related population, the index is called the 'basic risk index\" (Rbi) which calculates by the formula we develop. It illustrates how risky an area will be infected in accordance to their inflected history. The formula of Rbi is defined as:",

P is the target area population in terms of human mobility; basically it will be assumed as how many people spend most of time here, regardless of tourist or permanent residents. After Rbi is calculated, the spiral model (as in Fig. 2 ) will be applied to calculate the new risk index which concerning the geographic position and other factors. The idea of spiral model is centered on the target area as the center point, then the effects of the adjacency areas which surround the target area are estimated accordingly with various levels of effect. Each level is inputted with a user-defined value as a parameter, such as level 1=0.9 or 0.7, level 2=0.6 and so on. Later on the level parameter will be multiplied by the risk index of the corresponding area that it associates with. Here assuming there are some residents who are already infested with enterovirus infection in the surveillance period, N i . Further, each area will be set as a target area in turn, and the spiral computation traverses to re-calculate the risk index with reference to the other adjacent areas. In our case there are 30 areas in the grid of the city. There will be 30 target areas to be considered in turn by the spiral model to analyze the related risk index (S r ). Finally all the 30 risk indices would be computed in preparation for the next stepthat is to judge according to some user-defined rules on whether this area is deemed as risky area. For example, area 1 is set as the target area. By utilizing the spiral model to calculate the risk index in relation to its adjacent areas, we use the data set D r = { S r1, S r2, S r3, S r4, S r5 \u2026 etc }. Then we use the ranking method to select the several highest risk area. The types of risks are predefined as the following Table 1 . The computed results assist the user to determine this area is a center point of disease outbreak or potentially risky areas. Moreover, the risk standard as assumed in Table 1 is calculated by the averaging the risk index (A R ) of the area in the selected level and the mean of this list of number (M R ), the formula goes like this: the risk standard (S R ) = (A R + M R ) / 2. From the computed results, analyzer can study specific target areas by their disease breaking point and the propagation rate, potential intermediate or even safety zone.",

They are, chronologically, 218, 1023, 144, 822,1678, 1023, 1188, 2030 and 1017. A general regression trend indicates that the number critically increased over the years. The r-square value of the regression is 0.4114 which is not a bad fitting of forecast trend and the actual data. The rapid increase in recent year is quite uncommon.
