            "text": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disease characterized by gradual loss of upper and lower motor neurons, and is the most prototypic among motor neuron diseases. ALS leads to progressive muscle atrophy and weakness of the upper and lower extremities, bulbar palsy, and finally death within 3\u20135 years of onset due to respiratory failure. Although the exact cause of ALS remains unclear, various mechanisms including the deposition of intranuclear and cytosolic protein and RNA aggregates, disturbances of protein degradation, defective nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, altered neuronal excitability, altered axonal transport, and excessive oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS [1]. Oxidative stress might be an essential factor for the development of neurodegeneration in ALS. Several studies reported increased concentrations of the 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) marker for oxidative stress in the spinal cord of ALS patients and increased 3-NT immunoreactivity in motor neurons of both sporadic and familial ALS patients [2]. A recent study revealed that the magnitude of oxidative stress as measured by positron emission tomography of the brain (PET scan) with [62Cu]diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) correlates with clinical severity in ALS [3]. A biochemical study indicated that edaravone has been shown to eliminate peroxynitrite as well as lipid peroxyl radicals [4]. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in Japan demonstrated a significantly smaller decline in ALSFRS-R score compared with placebo [5]. Based on this clinical trial, edaravone was approved as a therapeutic drug for ALS in June 2015 in Japan and by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in December 2015. However, therapeutic effects and tolerance of edaravone on patients with ALS outside Japan are not yet reported. The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the effects of edaravone on ALS patients in the Korean population.",

ALSFRS-R was evaluated from the initial treatment throughout six cycles of treatment. Pulmonary function was checked with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). Patients were categorized with limb-onset type or bulbar-onset type based on the clinical features at the onset. Adverse events during six cycles of treatment were verified to determine the safety of edaravone. Edaravone was administered once per day via 60-min intravenous infusion. Edaravone was initially administered for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 2-week drug-free period, and subsequently administered for 10 days within a 2-week period according to the standard protocol [5]. The ALSFRS-R score consisted of 12 features which we divided into four domains as follows: bulbar (items 1\u20133), fine motor (items 4\u20136), gross motor (items 7\u20139), and respiratory (items 10\u201312) [8]. We estimated the changes of ALSFRS-R score and its individual domains to ascertain therapeutic effects.",

Nineteen patients met definitive ALS diagnostic criteria and three patients were probable ALS [6, 7]. Fifteen patients who had been treated with riluzole continued that treatment. Only two of the 22 patients met the inclusion criteria for the second phase 3 trial: scores of \u2265 2 points on all 12 items of the ALSFRS-R, forced vital capacity \u2265 80%, definite or probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, and disease duration of \u2264 2 years [5]. Six patients dropped out during follow-up due to adverse events such as aspiration pneumonia, abrupt clinical deterioration, and refusal of the continuous treatment. Finally, 16 patients completed six cycles of the treatment (patient 1~patient 16 in Table 1). The average onset age of these 16 patients was 52.7 \u00b1 9.2 years.

A recent meta-analysis of demographic and clinical data from Japanese, US, and European studies also showed a similar decline of 1.03 to 1.21 points/month in Japanese patients and 0.89 to 1.60 points/month in Caucasians. This suggests that the findings of these studies can be generalized in ALS patients irrespective of ethnicity [13]. The phase 3 clinical trial on edaravone showed an ALSFRS-R decline of mean 5.01 points in 6 months in the treated group, and a mean decline of 7.50 points in 6 months in the control group showing a difference of 2.49 points at the end of 6 months with statistical significance [5]. Our study showed a mean decline of 5.75 points which are in accordance with the edaravone treated group of the recent phase III clinical study. The baseline characteristics of the ALS patients enrolled in this study had a mean ALSFRS-R of 34.25 and mean FVC of 75%, reflecting a more advanced stage of ALS patients in these study patients compared with the recent phase 3 clinical trial. It is noteworthy to mention that a recent study on advanced ALS patients with a FVC of less than 60% showed no benefit of edaravone [14], reflecting the importance of early intervention in treating ALS patients, and our study showed significant efficacy in ALS patients with a mean FVC of 75%. More studies on different stages of ALS patients are needed to tailor down treatment criteria of edaravone.",

In our study, results also indicate that reduction is not limited to a specific domain but is even across various domains of ALSFRS-R. Of the 12 limb-onset patients and four bulbar-onset patients in our study, patients showed a statistically insignificant mean decline of 3.92 \u00b1 10.01 and 11.25 \u00b1 2.86 in the ALSFRS-R, respectively. Castillo-Viguera et al. suggested that a suppression of ALSFRS-R by more than 20% is clinically significant [15]; the phase 3 clinical trial on edaravone showed a suppression of 33%, similar to our study which showed suppression of 23% at the end of 6 months. When compared by gender, onset site or stable/declined groups, there were no statistical differences.",
