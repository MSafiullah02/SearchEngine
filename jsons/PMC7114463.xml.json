Expression of M and E protein is sufficient to assemble enveloped virus-like particles. The S protein is incorporated into these particles if present (Godeke et al., 2000, Vennema et al., 1996). The coronavirus M protein is localized in the cis- or trans-Golgi as reported for TGEV, IBV, and MHV (Klumperman et al., 1994, Locker et al., 1994, Machamer et al., 1990). The interaction of the IBV M and E proteins are mediated by their cytoplasmic domains (Corse and Machamer, 2003, Lim and Liu, 2001). It was shown that the E proteins of IBV and SARS-CoV contain a Golgi-targeting signal (Cohen et al., 2011, Corse and Machamer, 2000, Corse and Machamer, 2002).",

            "text": "\nNeuman et al. (2008) collected SARS-CoV grown on Vero-E6 cells by polyethylene glycol precipitation and purified the virus particles by banding on a sucrose density gradient. These purified samples were compared to samples treated with DNase I and proteinase K after the sucrose gradient purification step. A two-dimensional liquid chromatography MS/MS analysis was performed after in-solution digestion of the proteins. Two different extraction techniques were used: TCA precipitation and methanol delipidation, as not all proteins could be detected with either extraction procedure. In addition to the aforementioned viral proteins, Neuman et al. (2008) identified nearly 200 host proteins present in purified SARS-CoV related to different cellular functions. Three COPI coatomer components (\u03b1-COB, \u03b2-COP, and \u03b3-COP) and ADP-ribosylation factor 4 (ARF4), a protein involved in COPI trafficking, were detected in purified SARS-CoV particles by Neuman and coworkers. The COPI coatomer is involved in the retrograde vesicular transport between the ER and the Golgi, in transport between Golgi stacks, and in transport from the intermediate compartment to the cis-Golgi (Kirchhausen, 2000, Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005). ARF4 and COPI proteins are known to be abundant at membranes of the ERGIC, the site of coronavirus budding (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994, Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005). Mc Bride et al. demonstrated binding of COPI by a dibasic motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the SARS-CoV spike protein (McBride et al., 2007). Probably, COP and ARF proteins are involved in virus assembly and budding. Further host factors present in the ERGIC may also play a role, although they were not detected by the approach of Neuman and coworkers. Integral membrane proteins and membrane-associated proteins were underrepresented in the results of their study. The reason for this low amount of detected membrane proteins may be technical limitations, the biochemical properties of the proteins like low solubility or limited protease accessibility, or/and the exclusion of host proteins from the viral membranes by the M protein networks (de Haan et al., 2000).",

            "text": "In a proteomic analysis of an avian coronavirus, in purified infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) particles Kong and coworkers detected about 60 host proteins in addition to the viral proteins S and N (Kong et al., 2010). Kong et al. used IBV strain H52 grown on 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. After concentration through a 20% sucrose cushion, virus particles were purified through a discontinous sucrose gradient. Like Neuman and coworkers, Kong et al. confirmed the purity of their preparation by electron microscopy analysis. For their protein composition analysis, Kong et al. extracted the proteins from purified IB virions for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) profiles. All detected protein spots were excised from the gel and in-gel digested with trypsin. A MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis revealed the presence of the two viral proteins N and S and about 60 host proteins. Among them, 21 host proteins detected in purified IBV particles have not been described to be present in other virions (Kong et al., 2010). The reason for this may be that the virus was grown on embryonated eggs rather than in cultured cells, and that the amniotic fluid was used for virion purification. In contrast to Neuman et al., Kong and coworkers did not find ARF or COP proteins in their preparations. This may be due to the use of amniotic fluid for virion purification. Another group of host proteins, the heat-shock proteins (HSPs) were found by both groups (Kong et al., 2010, Neuman et al., 2008). HSPs are multifunctional proteins that facilitate protein folding and unfolding, prevent protein aggregation, are involved in cell signaling, and participate in vesicular transport processes. Therefore, these proteins may play a role for coronavirus assembly. Whereas Kong et al. have found HSP70 and HSP90 incorporated into IBV, Neuman et al. specifically identified HSP90 and classified HSP70 as a background protein. Furthermore, Kong et al. detected several cytoskeletal proteins that were incorporated into or associated with IB virions. Actins and tubulins as main cytoskeletal proteins may actively participate in moving viral components to the assembly sites. An interaction of the IBV M protein with \u03b2-actin and its putative role in virus assembly has been reported (Wang et al., 2009). Neuman et al. also detected cytoskeletal proteins in their SARS-CoV preparations. In addition to actin and tubulin, they identified myosin, filamin, and fibronectin. All these cytoskeletal proteins were also found in their background control samples but as they were consistently detected in proteinase K treated samples as well, they may have been incorporated into virions.",

In addition to viral proteins, they detected a large number of cellular proteins identical to those detected in the above described SARS-CoV and IBV proteomics. As reported for SARS-CoV and IBV particles, HSP90 and the cytoskeletal proteins \u03b2-actin and tubulin were identified by Nogales et al. in purified TGEV. Cytoskeletal proteins interact with numerous viral proteins. The transport machinery of actins can be involved at every step of the infectious cycle. For several viruses the presence of actin, tubulin, or other cytoskeletal proteins in virion preparations has been reported (Cantin et al., 2005, Chertova et al., 2006, Shaw et al., 2008). Nevertheless, some cellular proteins identified by the analysis of coronavirions by mass spectrometry simply may have been incorporated into the virions because of their high abundance at the viral budding site. In addition, some proteins may just adhere at the virion surface without being removed by proteinase K treatment. On the other hand, it is possible that some detected cellular proteins may have so far unknown functions different from those for which they are known.",

(2013) used the method of two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-DIGE) coupled with an analysis of the spots by MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS. For this purpose, swine testicular (ST) cells were compared at 48 h p.i. to mock-infected ST cells using CyDyes for staining of the different samples. For TGEV-infected ST cells, 33 differentially expressed protein spots were found, 23 of them up-regulated and 10 down-regulated during infection. Cytoskeletal proteins like \u03b2-actin as microfilament-associated protein, \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin as microtubule-associated proteins, and vimentin as intermediate filament protein have been identified to be differentially expressed in ST cells after TGEV infection. Actin and tubulin as components of the cytoskeleton play important roles in the life cycle of many viruses (Cudmore et al., 1997, Greber and Way, 2006, Ploubidou and Way, 2001, Radtke et al., 2006). The upregulation of \u03b2-actin and tubulins in TGEV-infected ST cells may be due to intracellular transport of viral proteins from the ER to the intermediate compartment and the Golgi apparatus with help of the cytoskeleton. Additionally, annexin 8 and annexin 4 were differentially expressed in TGEV-infected ST cells. Both are known as proteins involved in vesicular transport (Zhang et al., 2013).",

They analyzed chicken embryonic trachea and kidney tissues after in ovo infection by IBV using 2-DE with Coomassie Blue staining and MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS. Here, they found 17 differentially expressed proteins from tracheal tissue and 19 from kidney tissue (Cao et al., 2011). In their subsequent report, they analyzed the differentially expressed proteins in trachea and kidney tissues from chicken at different stages infected in vivo with two different IBV strains \u2013 a highly virulent and an attenuated one (Cao et al., 2012). In addition to their methods in the previous work, they applied 2-DIGE which is known to be much more sensitive than 2-DE. Here they reported that 58 differentially expressed proteins were detected. Some of the detected proteins showed differences in their expression level after infection with the virulent strain compared to the attenuated one. The changes occurred mainly in proteins with functions in cytoskeleton organization, anti-oxidative stress, and stress response. Like Zhang et al., Cao and co-workers identified different annexins (annexin A2 and annexin A5) being differentially expressed upon IBV infection. Annexins are calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins that are able to associate with the cytoskeleton (Moss and Morgan, 2004). Some annexins are known to have strong vesicle-aggregating activity (Donnelly and Moss, 1997). Annexin A2 was identified as an important host factor in the life cycle of several viruses being involved in virus assembly, release or replication (Backes et al., 2010, Beaton et al., 2002, Harrist et al., 2009, Ryzhova et al., 2006). The expression of Annexin A2 and A5 has also been found to be altered after IBV infection of Vero and avian cells (Emmott et al., 2010a, Emmott et al., 2010b).",

The cells were fractionated after isotope labeling into cytoplasmic, nuclear, and nucleolar extracts to reduce sample complexity but also to find out the different trafficking pathways of proteins. After separation by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, each protein band was cut out from the gel and in gel-digested with trypsin. The proteins were then identified and quantified by LC\u2013MS/MS. After IBV infection of Vero cells, one protein was reduced and 66 proteins were enriched in the cytoplasmic fraction (\u22652.0-fold). In the nuclear fraction, 35 proteins were reduced and 5 proteins were enriched. In the nucleolar proteome, 12 proteins were reduced and 22 proteins showed an increase. The results were analyzed using bioinformatic tools and classified according to their function. A network pathway analysis ruled out that proteins involved in cellular assembly, organization, morphology, signaling, and growth were differentially expressed in Vero cells due to IBV infection. Many of these proteins were e.g. linked to the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling cascades.",

In mock-infected cells this protein was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm whereas, it showed perinuclear and nuclear punctate staining in IBV-infected cells. Vimentin lost its enrichment in the perinuclear region due to syncytia formation of IBV-infected cells. Among the viral proteins, Emmott and coworkers detected the M and the N protein. The M protein was present in the cytoplasmic proteome whereas the N protein was detectable in all three fractions. In an additional paper, Emmott et al.

Additionally, Jiang and coworkers applied 2-DIGE followed by ESI-MS/MS identification. In the 2-DIGE approach, 63 proteins were identified with 17 of them down-regulated and 13 proteins that were up-regulated. By using the ICAT method, Jiang et al. identified 119 proteins that were up-regulated and 48 proteins, that were down-regulated by SARS-CoV infection. Jiang et al. compared the two methods they used to identify alteration in the cellular proteome after infection with SARS-CoV. Although only 15 differential proteins were identified with both methods, the overall expression alterations were similar using 2-DIGE and ICAT. The up-regulated proteins found in the infected cells were mainly present in the nuclei, whereas the down-regulated proteins distributed within the cell. The two methods, 2-DIGE and ICAT, were found by Jiang et al. to be complementary to each other. Proteins with high molecular mass or with low abundance were detected by ICAT whereas proteins in a certain low molecular mass range and cysteine-free proteins were detected by 2-DIGE. Among other proteins, Jiang et al. demonstrated the up-regulation of \u03b1-tubulin and HSP90 after SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells. These two proteins were also found by Neuman and coworkers in SARS-CoV purified particles (Neuman et al., 2008).",

Vogels and coworkers focused on the secretory pathway and investigated the changes in protein composition of an isolated Golgi-enriched fraction after infection of HeLa cells stably expressing the MHV receptor CEACAM1a. The cells were infected with MHV A59 (MOI of 50) and used 6 h p.i. for the isolation of the Golgi-enriched fraction. Proteins from this fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, in-gel digested with trypsin, and applied to LC\u2013MS/MS. Due to the stable isotope labeling, Vogels et al. could identify 43 proteins which were enriched and 73 which were depleted after MHV infection in the Golgi-enriched fraction. From these affected proteins, 13 proteins were selected and analyzed for their functional relevance in MHV replication by transfecting cells with siRNA. Three of them were further studied by overexpression of GFP-fusion constructs. With these experiments, Vogels et al. showed that C11orf59, GLG1, and SEC22B may play a role in MHV replication. Depletion of SEC22B, a vesicle-trafficking protein, led to an increase in infectious progeny virus. SEC22B is involved in vesicular trafficking between ER and Golgi (Hay et al., 1998). SEC22B might somehow interfere with MHV at the coronavirus assembly and budding site.",

For this purpose, the two GFP-fusion proteins, EGFP-N (encoding for the IBV N protein) and EGFP, were expressed in 293 T cells. After isotope labeling and cell lysis, the GFP-fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using GFP-trap beads. Protein samples recovered from the GFP-trap were separated by SDS-PAGE and gel slices were in-gel digested with trypsin. Resulting peptides were identified and quantified by LC\u2013MS/MS. In total, 142 cellular proteins appeared to interact specifically with the IBV N protein. Over a third of the identified proteins were ribosomal proteins. Three proteins, involved in the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules, have also been identified: Caprin-1, G3BP-1, and G3BP-2. Furthermore, Emmott and coworkers analyzed the co-localization of selected cellular proteins with the IBV N protein in IBV-infected cells. To show the relevance of the proteins in IBV infection, siRNA experiments were performed. Emmott et al. concluded in this paper that the N protein presumably did not interact with all 142 proteins individually; moreover, they found many complexes of cellular proteins, which could bind to the N protein via different hub proteins, such as nucleolin.",

With a high-throughput yeast two hybrid screen (HTY2H), Pfefferle and coworkers found 942 gene hits in their interaction screening of the SARS-CoV ORFeome and a cDNA library derived from human brain as well as an additional library containing ORFs encoding 5000 human proteins (Pfefferle et al., 2011). These hits were divided into four confidence categories with 132 hits in category A (highly confident interaction partners found more than once in one screen or several screens) and 383 hits in category B (single hits). The cDNAs of 86 interaction candidates were cloned in a luciferase vector, and interaction with the SARS-CoV ORFs, cloned in-frame with protein A domains, was validated by immunoprecipitation of the SARS-CoV proteins and subsequent measurement of the luciferase activity. About 48% of category A and 36% of category B interaction candidates were successfully validated with this approach.

In a screen with a human cDNA library, they found that the C-terminal cytoplasmic portion of the IBV M protein was able to interact with \u03b2-actin. Further co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this result obtained by Y2H. The region on the M protein responsible for the interaction with \u03b2-actin was mapped by constructing deletion mutants and one double mutant and analyzing them for their interaction with actin in yeast cells. Wang and coworkers concluded that the amino acids A159 and K160 are important for the interaction of the IBV M protein with \u03b2-actin. Furthermore, they postulated that actin filaments may be involved in assembly and budding of IB virions. As the M protein is the key player of viral assembly, its interaction with elements of the cytoskeleton may help to complete the IBV replication cycle. Free energy, gained by the interaction of the M protein with host proteins, may be necessary to complete coronavirus envelope assembly. Actin polymerization can serve as additional force for membrane bending during budding (Gov and Gopinathan, 2006). Additionally, actin may be involved in the movement of viral proteins to the coronavirus assembly site. Actin was found to be incorporated into IB virions as well as into other coronavirus particles (Kong et al., 2010, Neuman et al., 2008, Nogales et al., 2012). Actin-binding proteins like tropomyosin were found to be enriched after IBV infection (Cao et al., 2011, Cao et al., 2012).",

This mutation is expected to abolish the interaction with cellular proteins responsible for the tyrosine-based retention of the TGEV S protein at the ERGIC. Full-length S protein mutants with a tyrosine to alanine mutation at this position are transported to the cell surface and not retained at the ERGIC (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004).

The GST fusion proteins were purified using Protino\u00ae Glutathione Agarose 4B (Macherey-Nagel, Germany).

Due to the addition of 26 amino acids of the TGEV S protein C-terminus, the wt and mutant protein migrated a little bit slower than GST alone.",

For this purpose, IPI2I cell lysates containing comparable protein amounts were pre-incubated with Glutathione-agarose (for 1.5 h, 4 \u00b0C) before they were transferred to fresh beads that were pre-incubated for 1.5 h, 4 \u00b0C with the respective GST fusion proteins. After an additional incubation of 1.5 h at 4 \u00b0C, the samples were centrifuged and heated in SDS sample buffer at 96 \u00b0C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. In the sample, containing the GST_TGEVS_26aa and the IPI2I cell lysate an additional faint band at around 300 kDa was visible (Fig. 2\n). From all lanes containing cell lysates in the height of this band, gel slices were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. In addition to trypsin and glutathione-transferase which were both detected in the GST_TGEVS_26aa + IPI2I and in the GST_TGEVS(Y/A)_26aa + IPI2I lanes, filamin A was identified in the lane containing the TGEV S wildtype fusion protein (to be published) with an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to a molecular mass of about 300 kDa. This fits to the known molecular mass of filamin A. It is not completely clear why filamin A was not detected in the lane with the TGEV S mutant fusion protein: maybe there was no interaction of both of them or the amount of proteins was too low for detection. As this identification was at least a hint for a potential interaction candidate, we focused on filamin A and its potential role in TGEV infection.",

To verify this result, we immunoprecipitated ST cell lysates 8 h after infection with TGEV using an anti-S antibody. After Western blotting we were not able to detect filamin A in those immunoprecipitates although we obtained a strong filamin A band in ST cell lysates directly subjected to the Western blot analysis (data not shown).

They supposed that these cellular proteins are incorporated into the virions. According to this, we grew TGEV on ST cells, pelleted the virions from the cell culture supernatant after clarification, and purified the viral particles over a 20% to 50% sucrose gradient as described by Krempl and Herrler (2001). Samples with purified virions were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the respective viral proteins. In addition, one part of the purified TGE virions was separated by SDS-PAGE and compared with BHK21, IPI2I, and ST cell lysates for which we knew that they contain filamin A. In a Western blot analysis, we used the antibody against filamin A and detected this protein in the three cell lysates but not in our virus preparation (data not shown). Maybe filamin A is not present in TGEV particles or the amount of filamin A is too low to be detectable by Western Blot analysis. In mass spectrometry as performed by Neuman et al., we would probably be able to identify this low amount of filamin.",
