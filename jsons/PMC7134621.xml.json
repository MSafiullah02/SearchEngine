In 2015, yellow fever vaccination coverage in 22 affected African countries varied from 45% to 94%, with only 12 countries reaching >80% coverage,3 leading to persistent local transmission and posing a high risk of spread to neighbouring countries with porous borders and weak health systems. By Aug 18, in Angola, the mass vaccination campaign has only reached 31% of the target population.",

These events are occurring in regions with either the presence of the yellow fever vector and/or ongoing transmission, as in Latin America, or where the proportion of event participants from the yellow fever risk countries is considerable. For instance, in 2013, 14% of international Hajj pilgrims originated from the 46 yellow fever endemic countries. The proposed fractional dosing of the yellow fever vaccine to one-fifth of the standard dose of 0\u00b75 mL as an interim strategy to address vaccine shortages is both challenging and controversial. It not only requires assuring that the supply of suitable syringes is widely available, it contradicts the WHO International Health Regulation requirement of a single full dose of the vaccine to obtain yellow fever vaccine certification.1, 2, 3\n",

Mass gathering organisers must assure community and individual level availability of vector repellents and encourage and monitor their use routinely. Beyond the mass gathering host countries, where adequate vectors and susceptible human populations are present, vigilance, access to a stockpile of vaccines, and risk communication are critical to minimise and contain sporadic outbreaks.",
