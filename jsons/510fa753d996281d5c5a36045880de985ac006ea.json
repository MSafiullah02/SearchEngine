            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV inhibits cell proliferation. Our previous study indicated that Akt, which is poorly phosphorylated in confluent cultures of Vero E6 cells, is phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated upon infection by SARS-CoV. In the present study, we showed that a serine residue of Akt was phosphorylated in Vero E6 cells in subconfluent culture and that Akt was dephosphorylated rapidly after SARS-CoV infection without up-regulation of its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3b, which is one of the downstream targets of Akt, was prevented in SARS-CoV-infected cells. However, treatment with glycogen synthase kinase-3b small interfering RNA indicated that the glycogen synthase kinase-3b signaling pathway was not related to inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3 0 -kinase/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, which induces dephosphorylation of Akt, inhibited cell proliferation. As shown in our previous studies, apoptosis occurred in virus-infected cells within 18 h postinfection. Cellular mRNA transcription, which was reported to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, was not up-regulated in virusinfected Vero E6 cells, partially as a result of apoptosis. These results suggested that inhibition of cell proliferation is regulated by both the phosphatidylinositol 3 0 -kinase/Akt signaling pathway and by apoptosis in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. This is the first study to analyze SARS-CoV-induced cell growth inhibition.",

            "text": "Our recent studies indicated that signaling pathways are activated upon infection of confluent cultures of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV (Mizutani et al., 2004a,b,c) . Mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and extracellular signalrelated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and their MAPKKs, are activated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al., 2004b) . In particular, p38 is involved in induction of apoptosis because a p38 inhibitor was shown to partially prevent apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV infection. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, which is ordinarily phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue in Vero E6 cells, is dephosphorylated by SARS-CoV-induced activation of p38 (Mizutani et al., 2004a) . Akt, which has important antiapoptotic roles, is first phosphorylated at a single serine residue shortly after SARS-CoV infection, and subsequently dephosphorylated during the course of viral infection (Mizutani et al., 2004c) . However, threonine phosphorylation of Akt is not detected, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3b, which is a downstream target of Akt, is slightly phosphorylated in virus-infected cells, suggesting that Akt is unable to prevent virus-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, both Akt and JNK signaling pathways are important for establishing persistent SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al., 2005) . The weak activation of Akt in cloned Vero E6 cells cannot allow escape from SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis. Thus, the signaling pathway of apoptosis is stronger than the antiapoptotic pathway in virus-infected Vero E6 cells. Recent studies showed that expression of nucleocapsid, X1, and spike proteins of SARS-CoV can induce apoptosis in cells (He et al., 2003; Surjit et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004) . Interestingly, nucleocapsid protein induced apoptosis into COS-1 cells in the absence of growth factors, and both JNK and p38 MAPK were up-regulated in nucleocapsid expressing cells, whereas ERK1/2 and Akt were downregulated (Surjit et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Akt activated by phosphatidylinositol 3 0 -kinase (PI3K) regulates cell proliferation, the cell cycle and cell survival. A number of proteins, such as Bad, caspase-9 and GSK-3b, have been identified as downstream targets of Akt (Cardone et al., 1998; Pap & Cooper, 1998; Vanhaesebroeck & Alessi, 2000) . These proteins are inactivated when phosphorylated by Akt. Activation of Akt by infection with a number of viruses has been reported previously. LMP-1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus has been shown to bind to the p85 subunit of PI3K, resulting in activation of both PI3K and Akt (Dawson et al., 2003) . The middle T antigen of murine polyomavirus and the X protein of hepatitis B virus also bind to the p85 subunit of PI3K, leading to activation of Akt (Whitman et al., 1985; Dahl et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2001) . Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by a variety of viruses is thought to be involved in the establishment of latent and chronic infections by allowing virus-infected cells to escape from apoptosis. Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may lead to a delay in apoptosis of host cells, and the virus life cycle might be completed before apoptotic cell death of the host cells. Subsequent apoptosis facilitates the spread of the virus (Roulston et al., 1999) . As described above, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway also promotes cell proliferation. Mirza et al. (2004) reported that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway cooperates with the ERK signaling pathway to promote cell cycle progression in both normal and cancer cells. GSK-3b is a ubiquitously expressed protein-serine/threonine kinase and its activity is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation (Cross et al., 1995) . In addition, GSK-3 is now a well-known key component in a large number of cellular processes and disease states, including p53, hypoxia, prions and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Loberg et al., 2002; Song et al., 2002; Watcharasit et al., 2002; Perez et al., 2003) . The effects of activation of GSK-3b are mediated through phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 (Diehl et al., 1998) , resulting in the induction of cell cycle arrest via prevention of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) hyperphosphorylation.",

As shown in Fig. 2b (mock infection lane) , a serine residue of Akt was highly phosphorylated in subconfluent cultures. To examine whether the phosphorylated Akt was up-or down-regulated in subconfluent cell cultures upon SARS-CoV infection, a virus-infection time-course experiment was performed. Cells in subconfluent cultures were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and western blot analyses were performed using antibodies to viral and cellular proteins at 7, 16 and 23 h p.i. Protein from mock-infected cells was obtained at 7 h. The time-dependent changes of (phospho-)protein level, such as viral nucleocapsid and membrane proteins, the kinetics of MAPKs, including p38, JNK and ERK 1/2, and STAT-3 in virus-infected subconfluent Vero E6 cells were similar to those in confluent cells after viral infection (Fig. 2a,b ; Mizutani et al., 2004b) . As shown in Fig. 2a , only the kinetics of Ser473-phosphorylation of Akt were different. Akt, which was always phosphorylated in subconfluent cells, was dephosphorylated at 16 and 23 h p.i. On the other hand, Akt in mock-infected cells was continuously phosphorylated from 7 to 24 h p.i. (data not shown; Fig. 2c ). We measured the densities of Ser473-phosphorylated Akt of mock-infected subconfluent cells and SARS-CoV-infected confluent cells at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 2c) using the LAS-3000 mini system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The amount of phosphorylated Akt of mock-infected subconfluent cells was 4.8fold higher than that of SARS-CoV-infected confluent cells. GSK-3b was also dephosphorylated in SARS-CoV-infected subconfluent cells. We next investigated whether Akt was phosphorylated in virus-infected subconfluent cell cultures before 7 h p.i. The phosphorylation level of Akt-serine was not up-regulated at 2, 4 or 6 h p.i. (data not shown). The phosphorylation of GSK-3 were also similar at 2 and 6 h p.i. (data not shown). In addition, phosphorylation level of Akt kinase did not significantly change from 7 to 23 h p.i. (data not shown). These results suggested that SARS-CoV infection induces dephosphorylation of a serine residue of Akt in subconfluent cultures, without tentative up-regulation of phosphorylation prior to dephosphorylation.",

            "text": "The level of phosphorylated GSK-3b was decreased in virusinfected cells, possibly as a result of down-regulation of Akt activation (Fig. 2a) . Because one of the important roles of Akt is in cell cycle regulation by preventing GSK-3bmediated phosphorylation and degradation of cyclin D1 (Diehl et al., 1998) , we examined whether GSK-3b regulates the proliferation of Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were transfected with GSK-3b siRNA, and western blot analysis was performed 48 h later to detect the total amount of GSK-3b protein. As shown in Fig. 4a , the total amount of GSK-3b was reduced markedly by the siRNA, and the level of phosphorylated GSK-3b was reduced. However, GSK-3b siRNA-treated cells exhibited similar growth to those treated with control siRNA (Fig. 4b) . The total amount of Rb and phosphorylated Rb was not affected by GSK-3b siRNA. The hyperphosphorylation form of Rb is known to be phosphorylated at least at Ser795, Ser807, and Ser811 (Faenza et al., 2000; Jiang, 2002; Shibata & Nakamura, 2002) , and hyperphosphorylation of Rb at Ser795 to release E2F is a critical step in the G1-S transition (Harbour & Dean, 2000) . We next investigated whether inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibits cell proliferation of Vero E6 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 , complete inhibition by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, was observed at 48 h. We confirmed that serine residues of Akt were dephosphorylated in LY294002-treated cells in our previous study. These results EGF LY294002 P-GSK3a \u03b1/\u03b2 /\u03b2 GSK3\u03b2 P-Akt (Ser473) Fig. 3 . Phosphorylation status of Akt in subconfluent cells. Epidermal growth factor and LY294002 were added to subconfluent Vero E6 cells for 10 min and 1 h, respectively. The cell lysates were precipitated using anti-Akt antibody. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3b protein was added to the immunoprecipitated Akt with ATP, and western blot analysis was performed using antiphosphorylated GSK-3a/b and antiphosphorylated Akt (Ser) antibodies. suggested that activation of Akt in subconfluent Vero E6 cells plays important roles in cell proliferation, and that down-regulation of Akt activity in SARS-CoV-infected cells prevents cell proliferation.",

As indicated in our previous study, apoptotic events progress in virus-infected cells. Therefore, these findings strongly suggested that both events Akt-dephosphorylation and apoptosis are responsible for the inhibition of cell proliferation in SARS-CoV-infected cells. We feel that transcriptional activity in virus-infected cells is important for understanding the viability of cells. Cinatl et al. (2004) demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection regulates cellular gene expression in a SARS-CoV-permissive cell line, Caco-2, at 24 h p.i. using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We focused on up-regulated genes related to transfection factors, because several signaling pathways, which generally play important roles in the activation of transcription factors, are activated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. We selected 14 genes (including the housekeeping gene, GAPDH) that were shown previously to be upregulated by several stimuli (Cinatl et al., 2004) , and semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using total RNA extracted from virus-infected confluent Vero E6 cells at 24 h p.i. The amount of total RNA was adjusted by the level of ribosomal RNA (Fig. 6s ). Figure  6 (b,c) shows genes that were down-regulated and that showed similar expression upon SARS-CoV-infection compared to mock-infected cells, respectively. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, Ets variant gene 5, Zinc finger protein Transcripts of cellular genes were assessed for their relative abundance by RT-PCR. fected cells. These results suggested that transcriptional shutoff occurred in particular (or in many) cellular mRNAs due to SARS-CoV infection, and that virus-infected cells are not proliferative due to Akt dephosphorylation and apoptosis.",

            "text": "In the present study, we focused on the different kinetics of the phosphorylation status of Akt in subconfluent Vero E6 cells upon SARS-CoV infection. Akt-phosphorylation is upand down-regulated by virus infection in the confluent cells, as shown in our previous report (Mizutani et al., 2004) , but is down-regulated by virus infection in subconfluent cells. Therefore, one of the aims of the present study was to determine whether SARS-CoV has the potential for up-or down-regulation of Akt-phosphorylation in Vero E6 cells. Akt was phosphorylated in growing mock-infected cells (i.e. 30% confluency), whereas it was dephosphorylated in confluent cell cultures. An Akt-binding protein, carboxyl-terminal modulator protein (CTMP), is a well-known negative regulatory component of the Akt (Maira et al., 2001) . CTMP, which binds to Akt, reduces the activity of Akt by inhibiting phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. We found that the level of CTMP was below the limit of detection at 0-24 h p.i. in subconfluent virus-infected cells (data not shown), suggesting that dephosphorylation of Akt in subconfluent cell cultures upon viral infection was not regulated by CTMP. Although we obtained proteins from SARS-CoV-infected cells at different time points from 5 to 24 h p.i. in at least six experiments and performed western blot analysis using anti-phospho Akt (Ser) antibody, we were not able to find up-regulation of Akt-phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-infected subconfluent Vero E6 cells. Therefore, we concluded in this study that SARS-CoV has a potential of down-regulation of Akt-phosphorylation. It may be possible that SARS-CoV infection induces activation of Akt phosphatase(s). In our previous study, we showed that apoptotic events, such as caspase-3 activation and DNA ladder formation, were detected in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells at 18 and 24 h p.i., respectively (Mizutani et al., 2004b,c) . We could not find any up-regulated genes in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, in contrast with SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, in which several genes were demonstrated to be up-regulated (Cinatl et al., 2004) . This may have resulted from the faster progression of apoptosis and more rapid production of virus particles in infected Vero E6 as compared with Caco-2 cells. Thus, transcriptional shut-off in virus-infected cells may prevent cell proliferation with dephosphorylation of Akt.",
