            "text": "Identifying host factors that function in the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses is a major goal in molecular virology. Members of Picornaviridae, such as the well-studied poliovirus, with their relatively limited coding capacity must rely on available host factors to participate in the macromolecular interactions required for viral replicative processes. Cellular proteins functionally linked to viral RNA replication have been initially defined by their interaction with viral RNAs or replication polypeptides, or both. Compared to the study of host proteins involved with the viral proteins and RNA determinants required for picornavirus negative-strand RNA synthesis, much less work has been aimed at determining the factors necessary for positive-strand RNA synthesis. Not surprisingly, detailed studies of positive-strand RNA synthesis could only be undertaken once the process of negative-strand RNA synthesis had been somewhat unraveled. Further, the role of nuclear RNA-binding proteins in picornavirus replication has not been comprehensively investigated due, in part, to the original report by Pollack and Goldman (Pollack and Goldman, 1973) demonstrating that BSC-1 cells enucleated by treatment with cytochalasin B retained the ability to support the production of infectious poliovirus. However, it is possible that the treatment utilized in these early studies released nuclear proteins into the cytoplasm of the treated cells due to disruption of the nuclear envelope. In addition, it is noteworthy that following two rounds of cytochalasin B treatment and centrifugation, yields of poliovirus were reduced between five- and ten-fold compared to infection of untreated cells (Pollack and Goldman, 1973).",

            "text": "In the nucleus of the uninfected cell, primary transcripts of RNA polymerase II associate with a large number of nuclear RNA-binding proteins to form hnRNP complexes. These nuclear proteins assist with mRNA biogenesis and transport of nuclear pre-mRNA. Purified hnRNP complexes contain over 20 proteins, named according to size, from A1 to U. The most abundant protein in the complex, hnRNP C1, is expressed at approximately 100 million copies per cell, levels comparable to those for core histones (Dreyfuss et al., 1993). hnRNP C2, a splicing variant with an extra 13 amino acids, is expressed at approximately one-third the level of hnRNP C1. These two isoforms form stable heterotetramers [(C1)3C2] that bind cooperatively to RNA. Each isoform has an RNA-recognition motif (RRM), a basic leucine zipper-like motif (bZLM), a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear retention signal, and an acidic auxiliary domain thought to be involved in protein\u2013protein interactions that serve to increase the specificity of RNA binding (Gorlach et al., 1992, McAfee et al., 1996, Lai, 1998). The hnRNP C proteins are highly conserved among vertebrates, both immunologically and in their amino acid sequence, which suggests essential cellular functions (Dreyfuss et al., 1993). The major constituents of the core hnRNP complex, A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2, are assembled into hetero-tetrameric complexes of A1 and B2, B1 and A2, and C1 and C2 that together occupy approximately 700 nucleotides of RNA (Conway et al., 1988). The aggregation and disaggregation of the core hnRNP complex have been shown to be associated with RNA trafficking and nuclear export. hnRNP C is the only member of the core complex that does not appear to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm during interphase, due to the presence of a nuclear retention signal (Pinol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992). This suggests that removal of hnRNP C may be required for RNA to be exported. Because hnRNP C is the most tightly bound component of the core ribonucleoprotein complex, remodeling may be a regulated, energy-dependent process (Beyer et al., 1977). Moreover, hnRNP C is preferentially phosphorylated during mitosis, suggesting that its functions are regulated during the cell cycle (Pinol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1993, Schepens et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Investigators have reported that several nuclear RNA-binding proteins re-localize to the cytoplasm as a result of poliovirus infection. In addition to hnRNP A1, C, and K (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001), these include nucleolin, a primarily nuclear RNA-binding protein thought to be involved in rRNA metabolism, DNA replication, and apoptosis (Waggoner and Sarnow, 1998), Sam 68, an SH domain-binding protein (McBride et al., 1996), and the La autoantigen, a protein that binds to the poliovirus IRES (Meerovitch et al., 1993). We have previously described the interaction of hnRNP C with the 3\u2032 end of poliovirus negative-strand RNA and with poliovirus RNA replication polypeptides (Roehl and Semler, 1995, Brunner et al., 2005). A mutated form of hnRNP C1, with a truncation of the protein\u2013protein interaction auxiliary domain, impaired RNA synthesis in an in vitro replication assay. We demonstrated an interaction between hnRNP C and poliovirus RNA of both polarities recovered from extracts prepared from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells (Brunner et al., 2005). To further understand the involvement of hnRNP C in poliovirus RNA synthesis in infected cells, we utilized a human cell line (SK-OV-3) that expresses decreased levels of hnRNP C compared to other established human cell lines (e.g., 293 cells) (Holcik et al., 2003). SK-OV-3 cells, derived from an ovarian adenocarcinoma, are variably hypo-diploid (42 to 45 chromosome number), which could explain their modified expression of hnRNP C. Here we report that the concentration of hnRNP C proteins is substantially lower in SK-OV-3 cells compared to HeLa or 293 cells, in agreement with published findings (Holcik et al., 2003). Following infection of SK-OV-3 cells with poliovirus, we discovered that the kinetics of viral replication in these cells are significantly slower than the kinetics of replication in HeLa cells, especially during the first 8 h of infection. We provide evidence that this replication defect is due, in part, to reduced levels of positive-strand RNA produced during infection of SK-OV-3 cells. In addition, immunofluorescence studies, undertaken to examine hnRNP C distribution in SK-OV-3 cells during poliovirus infection, demonstrate that hnRNP C re-localizes to the cytoplasm, indicating an alteration in protein trafficking similar to that seen in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001). Expression of hnRNP C1, hnRNP C2, or both simultaneously by transient transfection of recombinant expression vectors in SK-OV-3 cells increased the kinetics of poliovirus replication compared to vector alone. These studies provide new evidence for a functional role of hnRNP C in poliovirus replication and further indicate that the protein may be involved in increasing the efficiency of genomic RNA synthesis.",

Using phosphorimager quantitation, the maximum level of positive-strand RNA synthesis in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A, lane 6) compared to SK-OV-3 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 9) was analyzed. Positive-strand viral RNA accumulation in poliovirus-infected SK-OV-3 cells at 5 h post-infection was approximately 45% of the level observed in HeLa cells, suggesting a positive-strand RNA synthesis defect during poliovirus infection of the SK-OV-3 cell line. To further investigate the difference in RNA synthesis for poliovirus negative-strand RNAs (using the total cellular RNA prepared in the same manner described above), we carried out additional RNase protection assays for poliovirus negative-strand RNA using the two-cycle method that has been described previously (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1991). Interestingly, the maximum level of negative-strand RNA accumulation in poliovirus-infected SK-OV-3 cells was approximately 85% of the amount observed for infected HeLa cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that poliovirus negative-strand RNA synthesis in infected SK-OV-3 cells remains largely intact. Therefore, these data indicate that the low virus yield observed in SK-OV-3 cells infected with poliovirus stems, in part, from an RNA replication defect primarily at the level of positive-strand RNA synthesis.",

Expression vectors FLAG-hnRNP C1, FLAG-hnRNP C2, FLAG-hnRNP C1 and C2, or pcDNA 3.1 (vector only) were transfected into SK-OV-3 cells growing on cover slips prior to infection with poliovirus at an MOI of 25. In uninfected cells, endogenous hnRNP C is the only component of the core hnRNP complex that does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm during interphase, due to the presence of a nuclear retention signal. To calculate transfection efficiency, we determined the number of cells expressing FLAG-tagged protein divided by the total number of cells in several representative fields. Cells were counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei and determine total cells per field. Transfection efficiency was determined to be approximately 25%.",

At 0 h post-infection, the localization of FLAG-tagged hnRNP C1 and C2 was strictly nuclear by immunofluorescence detection (Fig. 4, panels A, B, and C). This indicates that the hnRNP C proteins expressed in the cytoplasm from the transfected expression vectors were imported into the nucleus and were retained there due to the presence of intact nuclear localization and retention signals. However, at 3 h post-infection, FLAG-tagged hnRNP C1 and C2 were present in the cytoplasm of the poliovirus-infected SK-OV-3 cells, albeit at much lower levels than in the nucleus (Fig. 4, panels A, B, and C; white arrows). By 6 h post-infection, these proteins were almost completely re-localized to the cytoplasm in some cells (Fig. 4, panels A, B, and C; white arrows). In mock-infected SK-OV-3 cells, no change in sub-cellular distribution of hnRNP C was seen at either 3 h or 6 h post-infection (Fig. 4, panel D). This suggests that some disruption of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins occurred in the transiently transfected SK-OV-3 cells as a result of poliovirus infection similar to what has been demonstrated in HeLa cells (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001). The results of our experiments indicated that by 3 h post-infection, transiently-expressed hnRNP C proteins were available in the cytoplasm of approximately 25% of the cells for utilization in poliovirus RNA replication complexes.",

In a prokaryotic cell, a virus such as Q beta has access to nucleic acid-binding proteins in the absence of a nuclear envelope. Gene-poor cytoplasmic positive-strand RNA viruses (like poliovirus) that infect eukaryotic cells may have evolved successfully due, in part, to an ability to utilize the abundant cellular RNA-binding proteins that are primarily localized in the nucleus. There is accumulating evidence demonstrating that viruses not only use components of nuclear import\u2013export machinery for shuttling of viral macromolecules, but that viral infections disrupt normal host cell nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking pathways (Schneider and Shenk, 1987, von Kobbe et al., 2000, Petersen et al., 2000, Belov et al., 2000, Gustin and Sarnow, 2001, Gustin and Sarnow, 2002). A block in nuclear import combined with perturbed nuclear export is predicted to result in cytoplasmic accumulation of cellular proteins that could be recruited for viral processes, including amplification of the viral genome. Infection with picornaviruses has been shown to cause this type of trafficking disruption and re-localize nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm that have been implicated in functional interactions with poliovirus RNA (Belov et al., 2000, Gustin and Sarnow, 2001, Meerovitch et al., 1993, McBride et al., 1996, Waggoner and Sarnow, 1998). Particularly relevant to the results of the present study is the finding that hnRNP C is re-localized to the cytoplasm during infection of HeLa cells by poliovirus (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001).",

The delay primarily involves a defect in positive-strand RNA synthesis, although a slight defect in negative-strand synthesis was also detected. We have also demonstrated cytoplasmic re-localization of hnRNP C during poliovirus infection in SK-OV-3 cells that we propose results from a disruption of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking similar to that shown in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001). The re-localization appears to occur to a lesser extent or perhaps at a slower rate in SK-OV-3 cells than in HeLa cells. Increased expression of hnRNP C, by transient transfection, in SK-OV-3 cells increases the rate of poliovirus production compared to the rate seen in vector-only transfected cells. Unless there are other as yet undetected genetic alterations in SK-OV-3 cells, we would expect that cells stably transfected with these expression vectors would produce yields of poliovirus approaching those seen in HeLa cells for the same times after infection. We plan to develop stable SK-OV-3 cell lines with increased expression levels for hnRNP C and carry out such experiments.",

Based on the binding of hnRNP C to the 3\u2032 ends of poliovirus negative-strand RNAs and the genetic/functional data presented in the current study, we have proposed a model in which hnRNP C functions as part of a multi-component RNP complex or as an RNA chaperone that facilitates multiple initiations on the template for synthesis of poliovirus positive-strand RNA, as shown in Fig. 6\n. For simplicity, we have depicted the template for positive-strand RNA synthesis as single-stranded, although it may be a partially or completely double-stranded template RNA. Indeed, one possible role for hnRNP C is to facilitate or maintain strand separation of the partially double-stranded template as depicted in Fig. 6B. Once a relatively small number of poliovirus negative-strand RNA templates have been synthesized in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, the concentration of hnRNP C1 or C2 (or both) in the cytoplasm may be high enough to allow its binding to the high-affinity site, identified by SELEX (Soltaninassab et al., 1998; Brunner et al., 2005), at the 3\u2032 end. The viral RNA replication machinery and host cell functions could then be recruited to initiate positive-strand RNA synthesis. We propose that hnRNP C proteins contribute to the assembly, remodeling, and re-assembly of the complex that allows for initiation and rapid re-initiations of positive-strand RNA synthesis, especially at mid-to-late times after infection when they are significantly re-localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6C).",

            "text": "For picornaviruses and other positive-strand RNA viruses, RNA synthesis is asymmetric. Although we suspect that the double-stranded replicative form (RF) may be the primary template for assembly of the complex that initiates poliovirus positive-strand RNA synthesis, multiple initiations on the subsequently freed single-stranded negative-strand RNA are the means to efficient positive-strand (genomic) RNA synthesis. This leads to the accumulation of large numbers of positive-strand RNA molecules compared to negative-strand RNAs. Such template selection may require the functions of host cell proteins, given that many viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) require cellular proteins for full replication activity (Lai, 1998, Ahlquist et al., 2003). Since viral RdRps must replicate only viral RNA, but not any of the numerous cellular RNAs present in the infected cell, selection of the appropriate template for RNA-dependent RNA synthesis is critically important for successful viral replication. Cellular proteins may serve as part of the RdRp holoenzyme. Alternatively, host cell factors may bind directly to the viral RNA template, thus directing the RdRp to the template. Our data suggest that this latter possibility is the mechanism of action for hnRNP C in stimulating positive-strand RNA synthesis by the poliovirus RNA replication complex. Presumably, synthesis of RNA strands of each polarity requires unique cellular factors. Interestingly, the RdRp holoenzyme of Q beta can synthesize positive-strand RNA from the negative-strand RNA template, but requires an additional cellular factor, HF1, to direct the synthesis of negative-strand RNA from the phage genome (Barrera et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Brown et al. proposed that an intact 3\u2032 NCR of poliovirus genomic RNA contributes to the efficiency of positive-strand synthesis through sequence and/or structural elements conserved at the 5\u2032 end of the poliovirus negative-strand RNA (Brown et al., 2004). It is hypothesized that RNA viruses may assemble RNA transcription or replication complexes which bring non-contiguous regions of viral RNA together, similar to the interaction between enhancer and promoter elements in DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. One end of the viral RNA could function as an enhancer while the other end could serve as a promoter (Lai, 1998). Long-range interactions bridging the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the viral genome via protein\u2013protein contacts have been studied in the context of initiation of negative-strand and positive-strand RNA synthesis. For mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus, published data suggest that there is protein-mediated 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 cross talk between the termini of the RNA of both polarities which may be important for RNA transcription and replication (Huang and Lai, 2001). Protein-mediated circularization of the poliovirus positive-strand RNA template has been proposed to occur, thereby increasing the efficiency of negative-strand RNA synthesis (Barton et al., 2001, Herold and Andino, 2001). It is possible that once sufficient concentrations of both hnRNP C1 and C2 proteins are present in the cytoplasm, stable tetramers could form and link the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the negative-strand RNA to make re-initiations and positive-strand RNA synthesis more efficient (Fig. 6C).",

Negative-strand viral RNA accumulation was determined using an RNase protection assay as described in Materials and methods. Untreated radiolabeled probe is shown in lane 1. As a positive control for protection of the target virus RNA, 100 ng of purified pT7NPV1 negative-strand RNA was used for lane 2. Equal amounts (1.3 \u00b5g) of total cellular RNA were protected by 75 fmol of probe corresponding to positive-sense poliovirus RNA sequences 5601 to 5809 (lanes 3 to 8). HeLa cells (lane 3 to lane 5) or SK-OV-3 cells (lane 6 to lane 8) were infected with wild type poliovirus. The RNA harvest times (hours post-infection) are indicated at the top of each lane. The protected probe is indicated by the arrow and asterisk on the right side of the panel. These data are representative of three independent experiments. Gel lanes not relevant to this experiment were cropped from this figure, resulting in a spliced image (between lanes 1 and 2, and lanes 5 and 6).",

A. To demonstrate the increased levels of hnRNP C proteins following transient transfection, monolayers of SK-OV-3 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA corresponding to pcDNA3.1 (empty vector), lane 1, or FLAG-hnRNP C1 expression vector, lane 2. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were harvested. Equal amounts of protein (5 \u00b5g) taken from whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then electro-blotted to a PVDF membrane which was subsequently probed with a monoclonal antibody to hnRNP C (Abcam) and a monoclonal antibody recognizing the FLAG epitope (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:5000 in blotting buffer. The blot was developed at room temperature with 1-STEP NBT/BCIP (Pierce). Arrows indicate hnRNP C1 and C2 and the FLAG-tagged hnRNP C1 protein. B.

A. hnRNP C proteins are re-localized to the cytoplasm due to disruption of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking as the result of poliovirus infection. B. Initiation of positive-strand RNA synthesis occurs on the replicative form involving hnRNP C bound to the 3\u2032 end of negative-strand template RNA, possibly in complexes with the viral 3D polymerase and other viral replication proteins (e.g., 3CD and/or 2C). VPg-UU depicts the genome-linked protein covalently linked to two uridine residues, which serves as a primer for RNA synthesis. Note that in this part of the model, we have shown hnRNP C without designating the specific involvement of hnRNP C1 or C2 (or both). C. As RNA replication proceeds, the efficiency of multiple re-initiations of poliovirus positive-strand RNA synthesis may be facilitated by the binding of hnRNP C proteins to negative-strand template RNA and poliovirus replication proteins (e.g., 3D polymerase, 3CD, and/or 2C). Here we have depicted hnRNP C as a (C1)3C2 heterotetramer, although there are currently no data regarding the multimeric state of hnRNP C bound to poliovirus RNAs.",
