These viruses cause millions of human infections each year ranging from mild febrile symptoms to fatal hemorrhagic/neurologic disease (Gubler, 2002, Guzman et al., 2010, Halstead and Thomas, 2010, Hayes et al., 2005, Monath, 2008). During recent decades, the dramatic increase in the movement of humans, animals and commodities via modern transportation, unplanned urbanization in tropical developing countries and the lack of adequate public health infrastructures have enabled these pathogens to expand their geographic ranges to cause major epidemics (Artsob et al., 2009, Duffy et al., 2009, Gould and Solomon, 2008, Gubler, 2004).",

Translation of the ORF leads to synthesis of a polyprotein that is cleaved by host and viral proteases to release structural and non-structural viral proteins (Harris et al., 2006). The structural proteins (C, prM, and E) are located in the N-terminal portion of the polyprotein and the non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) in the remaining C-terminal portion of the polyprotein (Lindenbach et al., 2007).",

The first reports of the infectivity of animal virus nucleic acids were made in 1957 by Colter et al. for Mengovirus, Poliovirus and WNV and by Wecker and Schafer for Eastern equine encephalitis virus (Colter et al., 1957, Wecker and Schafer, 1957). This principle has been exploited as molecular techniques have improved. A bacterial DNA plasmid clone containing the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of a positive-strand RNA virus and a suitable promoter, such as T7 can be used to produce infectious genomic viral RNA by in vitro transcription. These DNA clones enable the introduction of mutations into viral genomes and the consequent study of the resulting phenotype (Ruggli and Rice, 1999). This powerful molecular tool is frequently referred to as reverse genetics.",

With the development of in vitro transcription systems and the use of bacteriophage promoters (SP6, T7), it also became possible to synthesize in vitro full length viral RNA with a much higher efficiency when compared with cDNA transcription in the cell. Furthermore, development of more efficient transfection methodologies, such as the use of cationic liposomes (Malone et al., 1989) and electroporation, improved the efficiency of RNA transfection of cultured cells. Thus, the basic methodology for reverse genetics technology was established.",

As for poliovirus, the complete genome sequence of the YFV 17D vaccine strain was determined (Rice et al., 1985) resulting in a profound reorganization of the classification of arboviruses (flaviviruses and alphaviruses were assigned to different families using data from their genome organization). During this developmental work, cloning the complete genome into bacterial plasmids proved to be impossible due to instability of the construct in E\nscherichia\ncoli. This difficulty was circumvented by cloning two segments of the genome in separate plasmids.

The pioneering work of Gritsun and Gould (1995) significantly improved this method by using a combination of primer sets and optimizing their concentrations (Gritsun and Gould, 1995). They produced two long overlapping PCR products (5.2 and 5.7 kb) by RT-PCR, ligated and transcribed them into full-length viral RNA. Using this principle, infectious full-length RNA transcripts were realizable even for situations in which the virus genome could not easily be cloned in bacteria. Moreover, it avoided the need for virus purification and shortened the time to produce engineered virus from years to days. However, despite the success in generation of infectious transcripts from long RT-PCR amplicons without cloning, a stable full-length clone of virus genomes is still a valuable genetic resource for DNA (and ultimately) RNA manipulation.",

Sanger\u2019s method (dideoxy or chain-termination) was the traditional approach to DNA sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977). Initially, the methods were completely manual and used radioactive ladders displayed on huge acrylamide gels. Subsequently, the radioisotopes were replaced using four different fluorescent dyes in the sequencing reactions (Smith et al., 1985). This improvement rapidly led to the development of the first automated fluorescence DNA sequencer (Ansorge et al., 1986, Ansorge et al., 1987, Brumbaugh et al., 1988, Hood et al., 1987, Hunkapiller, 1991, Hunkapiller et al., 1991, Prober et al., 1987, Smith, 1986). The next breakthrough was made with the description of the first high electric field separations of DNA sequencing fragments using capillary electrophoresis in 1990 (Swerdlow and Gesteland, 1990) and the first adaptation to display the results as an array (Zagursky and McCormick, 1990). From this adaptation, the first commercial automated DNA sequencer that used capillary electrophoresis rather than a slab gel, became available in 1996.",

The early pioneer of sequence databases was Margaret Dayhoff who had previously established a protein sequence database and published the first collection of nucleotide sequence information in 1981 (Dayhoff et al., 1981). Shortly thereafter, GenBank was created in 1982 by the National Institute of Health, USA. GenBank provided a timely, centralized, accessible repository for genetic sequences (Bilofsky et al., 1986). In parallel with the growth of databases, methods to prepare robust sequence alignments for detailed comparison soon became the rate-limiting step in the analysis of sequence data. The development of rapid search programs such as FASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) and BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) made it practical to identify genes in a new sequence by comparison with sequences already in the databases. Bioinformatics which was in its infancy suddenly became essential for the interpretation of these sequence data and for the generation of testable hypotheses arising from the data. The first sequence analysis software then began to appear such as MEGA which offered the possibility of producing phylogenetic trees from nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments (Kumar et al., 1994). The production of software for analysis of sequence data is now a major growth industry, with new and improved methods appearing frequently.",

The first next-generation high-throughput sequencing technology, the 454 FLX pyrosequencing platforms, became available in 2005.

The most recent examples include Heliscope and Ion Torrent PGM which became available in 2010.

Subsequently, improvements in PCR enzyme fidelity and optimization of reaction conditions, led to major increases in the achievable length of authentic cDNA amplicons, finally enabling rapid amplification of genomic length cDNA (Barnes, 1994, Gritsun and Gould, 1995). As indicated earlier, de novo synthesis of genomic length cDNA is now possible but currently is not the first method of choice.

A method of selecting cells that have received a plasmid is therefore required and an appropriate selective pressure must be imposed for maintenance and enhancement of the plasmid. Almost all conventional plasmids use an antibiotic resistance gene, carried on the backbone of the vector, as a selectable marker. Thus, the addition of the appropriate antibiotic to the growth medium will kill the cells that do not contain the plasmid and produce a culture in which all cells do contain a plasmid. In many cases, the choice of antibiotic is not restricted. However, some cloning strains of E. coli are inherently resistant to some antibiotics. Thus, in these cases these antibiotics cannot be used to select cells carrying the plasmid of interest. The genotype of the desired cloning strain should be checked prior to cloning.",

Even if the protein is expressed poorly from the cloned DNA, the presence of many copies of the plasmid may raise the level of protein to toxic levels. In cases when recombinants are still obtained, their growth rate is often frustratingly slow, and the cloned foreign DNA sequences are often unstable (Blaney et al., 2006, Ruggli and Rice, 1999, Ward and Davidson, 2008).

For example with TBEV, the cDNA was cloned into the low copy number plasmid pBR322 (Gritsun and Gould, 1998) whereas the Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) prototype strain 1-51 was inserted into the low-copy-number plasmid vector pMC18 (Hurrelbrink et al., 1999) and the complete full-length cDNA of YFV was inserted under the control of an SP6 promoter in the low copy number plasmid pACYC177 (Bredenbeek et al., 2003). Similar approaches have been used for different strains of DENV-2 (Gualano et al., 1998, Kinney et al., 1997, Polo et al., 1997, Zhu et al., 2007), WNV (Shi et al., 2002, Yamshchikov et al., 2001b), KUNV (Khromykh and Westaway, 1994) or TBEV (Mandl et al., 1997). However, this does not always resolve the problem. For example, several attempts to construct genetically stable JEV cDNAs using low-, medium-, and high-copy-numbers of plasmids or special bacterial hosts all failed (Mishin et al., 2001, Sumiyoshi et al., 1992, Sumiyoshi et al., 1995).",

The most commonly used promoters for flavivirus infectious clones are the bacteriophage promoters T7 and SP6, and to a lesser extent, the eukaryotic promoter of the human cytomegalovirus (referred here as CMV promoter) (see Fig. 1). Each has its own advantages. Bacteriophage promoters are used in vitro to produce large quantities of viral RNA from cDNA with bacteriophage RNA polymerases. The transcripts are then transfected directly into permissive cells or animals, and infectious virus can be recovered. In general, SP6 polymerase/promoters have lower efficiency than T7 in vitro transcription systems but under ideal conditions SP6 is roughly comparable with the others. However, these RNA polymerases are error prone, therefore, RNA transcripts cannot be viewed as genetically homogeneous populations (Boyer et al., 1992, Sooknanan et al., 1994).",

However, its use and practical importance are often limited due to instability of the construct during propagation in E. coli. This problem has been particularly evident when developing flavivirus infectious clones. As a consequence, some virus infectious clones are either almost impossible to construct, or are very difficult to maintain in E. coli due to their predisposition to spontaneous rearrangements and/or to acquisition of stabilizing mutations. The most plausible explanation is that such instability results from unanticipated expression of viral cDNA encoding products toxic to the bacterial host. Thus, different strategies have been elaborated based on the observation that artificially introduced deletions, insertions or frameshifts can alleviate the cloning problems, either by increasing the stability of the construct, decreasing the transcriptional activity of the promoter or the cryptic expression of viral proteins.",

This approach was conceived from the observation that a single nonsense mutation, that result in the apparition of a premature stop codon, was often sufficient to stabilize the entire construct presumably by preventing synthesis of toxic products. Hence, temporary ablation of such deleterious expression at the translational level by interrupting the ORF, with the help of an intron containing stop codon(s), was beneficial during propagation of recombinant plasmids in E. coli. The intron effectively blocked synthesis of toxic products in the bacterial host, even if spurious transcription resulted in formation of mRNA. Nuclear transcription in eukaryotic cells, accompanied by splicing of the primary transcripts, would lead to precise excision of the intron and restoration of the original ORF. For virus infectious clones and viral replicon-based expression vectors, subsequent export of mRNA to the cytoplasm and its translation resulted in synthesis of viral proteins, which initiated the viral infectious cycle or replication of vector RNA. Using this approach, deleterious effects of spurious transcription from eukaryotic promoters in bacterial cells were eliminated at the translational level by insertion of an intron(s) into viral cDNA cassettes. Nevertheless, in some cases modification of the viral cassette was not always feasible possibly because the problem for implementation of the proposed approach was associated with the potential existence of cryptic splice sites in viral RNA genomes (Shiu et al., 1997). However, when potential sites were found this did not appear to have a substantial impact on the functional properties of the designed infectious DNA constructs.",

Using the knowledge that certain regulatory elements of eukaryotic genes, such as enhancers, can influence gene expression in position- and orientation-independent manner (Jonsson et al., 1994) the enhancer region was separated from the promoter region and moved either directly upstream of the promoter or immediately following the polyadenylation site. The deletion of the enhancer led to a 5- to 6-fold reduction of gene expression. In contrast, the relocalization of the CMV enhancer downstream of the reporter gene had no discernible effect on gene production in E. coli. Insertion of the CMV enhancer after the polyadenylation signal resulted in a 10- to 100-fold increase of the transcription rate in mammalian cells without affecting the stability of constructs in E. coli.",

Hence, they designed a new approach to assembling infectious DENV-2 and JEV cDNA clones by introducing silent mutations into the ECP sequences within the DENV-2 and JEV genomes.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a popular eukaryotic host in cases for which viral cDNA was assembled by homologous recombination. The two common strategies for cloning DNA in yeast are the assembly of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and the use of yeast-E. coli shuttle vectors such as pRS424. Using this approach, Polo et al. (1997) assembled full-length DENV-2 cDNA in yeast by recombination in vivo, followed by transformation of E. coli to produce plasmid DNA for in vitro transcription (Polo et al., 1997). Similar approach have also been applied for DENV-3 (Santos et al., 2013). Even if the problems with deleterious effects and instability in the E. coli host were not completely eliminated, this method enabled recovery of infectious full-length RNA transcripts. Of the two methods used to assemble the full-length DENV clone, the shuttle vector approach was simpler and more reliable than the YAC approach essentially due to the need of a supplementary cloning step before the infectious clone could be recovered from the YAC in bacteria. The same method has also been used to assemble full-length DENV-1 (Puri et al., 2000) and DENV-4 (Kelly et al., 2010) cDNAs.",

The procedure developed was based on the high fidelity, high yield, long PCR protocols described by Barnes (1994) and Cheng et al. (1994) and utilized a mixture of two thermostable DNA polymerases, one of which possessed a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease \u201cproofreading\u201d activity, to produce two overlapping cDNA products (5.7 and 5.2 kb in length) representing the full-length genome of the virus (Barnes, 1994, Cheng et al., 1994). The 5\u2032 half of the cDNA was designed to contain an SP6 promoter added in the first forward primer. Full-length cDNA of Vs virus was then produced either by ligation of the two overlapping DNA molecules in a unique restriction site or by fusion PCR. When directly inoculated intra-cerebrally into mice, the in vitro transcribed RNA from these templates was infectious. This method avoided the need for virus purification and cDNA cloning procedures and shortened the time to produce engineered virus from years to days. This was the first report in which an infectious RNA virus has been derived by PCR without intermediate cloning of the cDNA in microbial vectors.",

For that purpose, the RT-PCR fragments contain overlapping ends and the first and the last RT-PCR amplicons also have overlapping ends with the vector fragment to ensure that when the fragments and the vector are mixed and denatured, the overlapping ends anneal to each other. DNA polymerase then extends the fragments, using the neighboring fragment as a primer. If the overlapping fragments are designed to have similar annealing temperatures, this reaction generates a circular end product. The generated circular product can then be transfected directly into competent cells without any additional manipulations since the in vitro RNA transcription step was eliminated by replacing SP6 or T7 polymerase promoters with the CMV promoter, thus allowing transcription of viral RNA in cells directly from plasmid DNAs by the cellular RNA polymerase II (Edmonds et al., 2013).",

This procedure does not require cloning, propagation of cDNA into bacteria or in vitro RNA transcription. Entire genomes have been amplified by PCR in 3 DNA fragments of approximately 4 kb, each with 70\u2013100 bp overlapping regions. The first and last fragments were flanked respectively in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 by the CMV promoter and the hepatitis delta ribozyme followed by the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal. PCR products were mixed and transfected into permissive cells which enabled the recovery of infectious viruses. Unlike other bacterium free approaches, the ISA method does not require any additional step beside the PCR amplification needed to obtain the different cDNA fragments. Instead, the process proceeds naturally by in cellulo recombination, which greatly facilitates and shortens the procedure.",

In the case of arboviruses, an additional factor is involved. These viral agents alternate between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts. Consequently, the mutant spectrum is likely to reflect these selective constraints, resulting in variant populations that ensure selection of phenotypes efficient in replication and transmission between both hosts (Ciota et al., 2008, Ciota et al., 2007, Coffey and Vignuzzi, 2011, Coffey et al., 2008).",

The viral cDNA is cloned into a vector (plasmid, BAC, cosmid), and infectious viruses are then recovered either by in vitro transcription using bacteriophage RNA polymerase and transfection into permissive cells, or they are directly recovered from transfected cells through the use of a eukaryotic transcriptional promoter. The transfected cDNA used to recover infectious viruses can be considered as clonal and consequently, at this stage, the mutant spectrum present in the original virus population no longer exists. Currently, viral populations approximating to clonality can be obtained using either of the following two methods, production of viral genomic cDNA cloned into a plasmid under the control of a eukaryote promoter or clonal subgenomic cDNA fragments (e.g., plasmid fragments used instead of PCR products using the ISA method). Potential impacts arising from the depletion of mutant spectra could result in modification of the viral phenotype. For example, it was observed that viruses recovered using reverse genetics initiated from clonal populations, replicated more slowly than their corresponding parent non-cloned ancestors (Coffey and Vignuzzi, 2011, Kinney et al., 1997, Pierro et al., 2006) or they exhibited reduced neurovirulence for rodents (Hayasaka et al., 2004). However, based on consensus sequencing, mutations could not be identified to account for these different phenotypes. These examples illustrate some of the potential limitations of the reverse genetics and sequencing methods used to investigate the basis of virus pathogenesis.",

For example, error-prone DNA-dependent RNA polymerases such as T7 or SP6 introduce random mutations during in vitro transcription of viral RNA genomes from cloned cDNA. Moreover, DNA dependent DNA polymerases can also generate errors. Thus, the possible use of PCR enzymes that exhibit different levels of fidelity could be considered as a means of regulating the variant composition within the mutant spectrum and presumably, changing the phenotype of the recovered virus. Indeed, one could visualize the use of such methods to investigate the underlying basis of viral pathogenesis and in the case of arboviruses to examine the impact of altered mutant spectra on virus\u2013vector\u2013host interactions.",

            "text": "As examples, point mutations engineered into the prM or E proteins of DENV-2/WNV chimeric viruses have been shown to improve viability and viral yields in cell cultures (Huang et al., 2005). DENV-2 viruses containing single point substitution in the 5\u2032 UTR exhibited reduced replicative fitness in cellulo and reduced neurovirulence for newborn mice (Leardkamolkarn et al., 2010). This observation was confirmed for several other flaviviruses when deletions were engineered into the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTR causing attenuation in cell culture and in animals (Blaney et al., 2010, Blaney et al., 2008, Cahour et al., 1995, Mandl et al., 1998, Men et al., 1996, Zeng et al., 1998). Van Slyke et al. (2012) engineered point mutations in the WNV NS5 gene which encodes the RNA polymerase (Van Slyke et al., 2012). The point mutations were positioned remote from the polymerase active site. This resulted in reduced replicative fitness in cellulo and attenuation of neurovirulence in vivo. Five shared point mutations were introduced in the hinge region spanning domains I and II of the E glycoprotein of JEV (residues E107, E138, E279, E315, E439) and WNV (residues E107, E138, and the corresponding E280, E316 and E440) (Arroyo et al., 2001, Arroyo et al., 2004) and also 3 mutations were introduced in the upperlateral surface of domain III of TBEV (residues E308, E310, E311) (Mandl et al., 2000). In each of these examples the viruses showed reduced neurovirulence in mice. However, the single mutation located in the hinge region, E279, of JEV increased neurovirulence (Monath et al., 2002). Thus, each study identified a direct association between a specific viral genomic region or specific site and the corresponding biological properties of the virus.",

            "text": "In addition to linking specific mutations to alteration of viral replication or virulence characteristics, reverse genetics has also enabled precise identification of the specific stage within the viral replication cycle that is altered. In a remarkable example of this, a silent mutation in the NS2A gene of the vaccine strain of JEV (JEV-SA-14-14-2) has been shown to abolish the formation of the large NS1\u2032 protein by destabilizing a conserved RNA pseudoknot secondary structure responsible for the occurrence of a ribosomal frameshift, thus reducing neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness in mice (Ye et al., 2012). In another study, mutation E138K in JEV domain I of the E protein, had a direct impact on viral spread from cell to cell by increasing virus-cell interactions and decreasing viral entry efficiency (Zhao et al., 2005) resulting in reduced expression kinetics of viral proteins, including the NS5 protein, an Interferon (IFN) antagonist (Lin et al., 2006), which in turn, leads to reduced capacity to block IFN signaling and increases the attenuation phenotype (Liang et al., 2009). Other studies on JEV, MVEV and DENV have indicated that mutations in domains II and III of the E protein can impair virus binding and entry into host cells (Hung et al., 2004, Hurrelbrink and McMinn, 2001, Liu et al., 2004, Modis et al., 2004). More recently, De Wispelaere and Yang (2012) showed that mutation of three conserved residues in the Domain I/Domain III linker of the DENV-2 E protein greatly impaired viral production by abolishing formation of viral particles within the cells (de Wispelaere and Yang, 2012).",

This sfRNA has been shown to play an important role in the virus replication cycle and contributes to viral cyto- and host-pathogenicity.

They also showed that the reverse substitution in a non-virulent DENV-2 strain TSV01 was sufficient to make this strain virulent in the same mouse model. Several other viral determinants modulating the intrinsic virulence of DENV, for mice, have been identified and shown to affect either the replication efficiency (Leardkamolkarn et al., 2010) or the binding properties (Bray et al., 1998, Gualano et al., 1998, Prestwood et al., 2008). Similar results were obtained with the JEV strain Mie/41/2002 in which the E-S123R amino-acid substitution exhibited increased virulence for mice (Tajima et al., 2010). Notably, a correlation between growth properties in cellulo and virulence in vivo was not always observed. Indeed, Yamaguchi et al.

Using in vitro experiments the specific binding sites on the WNV 3\u2032 (\u2212)SL RNA were identified and the effects of mutations on virus replication within these binding sites were analyzed. The efficiency of genomic RNA synthesis and virus production progressively decreased with decreasing in vitro binding efficiency of TIAR/TIA-1 for mutant 3\u2032 (\u2212)SL RNAs. In these experiments neither TIA-1 nor TIAR was found to bind to the 3\u2032 (+)SL or 5\u2032 (+)SL of the genomic RNA. The fact that several mutant RNAs that inefficiently interacted with TIAR/TIA-1 in vitro rapidly reverted in vivo, indicated that they could replicate at a low level. This suggests that interaction between TIAR/TIA-1 and the viral 3\u2032 (\u2212)SL RNA is not required for initial low-level symmetric RNA replication but instead facilitates the subsequent asymmetric amplification of genome RNA from the minus-strand template.",

This introduced mutation induces drastic diminution of KUNV neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in mice and this virus was also partially attenuated in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2\u03b3 receptor knockout mice.

The viral determinants responsible for host tropism and vector specificity remain largely undefined. In order to explore the role of the UTRs in host specificity, chimeric genomes were generated in which the 5\u2032 UTR, capsid and/or 3\u2032 UTR encoding regions of mosquito-borne DENV-4 were replaced, separately or in combination, with those of tick-borne LGTV. None of the chimeric genomes yielded detectable virus following transfection. Replacement of the variable region (VR) in the DENV-4 3\u2032 UTR (DENV-4-LGTswapVR) with that of LGTV showed lower replication than its wild-type parents in mammalian cells but not in mosquito cells and was able to infect mosquitoes in vivo. Moreover, LGTV was able to infect ticks while DENV-4 or DENV-4-LGTswapVR did not (Tumban et al., 2011). These results suggest that UTRs cannot be exchanged between tick-borne and mosquito-borne flaviviruses and that the 3\u2032 VR did not affect mode of transmission.",

For these experiments, the prM+E region or the AnchC+prM+E region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses YFV-17D or the DENV-2 were replaced by the corresponding region of the NKV flavivirus Modoc virus (MODV). These chimeric viruses replicated efficiently in mammalian (Vero-B) and mosquito (C6/36) cells, whereas infectious MODV RNA failed to replicate in mosquito cells (Charlier et al., 2010). These observations suggest that the inability of NKV flaviviruses to replicate in arthropod cells is not determined by the viral E proteins but appears to occur at a post-entry stage most likely due to the differences in host protein profiles between mammalian and arthropods cells. The results obtained by Saiyasombat et al. (2014) using a similar approach corroborate these observations and indicate that the vertebrate host specificity of MODV could be conditioned by genetic elements located outside of the prM+E region (Saiyasombat et al., 2014).",

Mutagenesis of an infectious clone of DENV-4 revealed that disruption of the DCS-PK structure hindered the ability of 5\u2032 RNA to bind to 3\u2032 RNA, whereas restoration of the DCS-PK structure facilitated recovery of the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 complex demonstrating its role in viral replication. Mutagenesis also showed that the function of DCS-PK depends on its position relative to the 5\u2032 cyclization sequence, its secondary structure and its specific primary sequence. Based on these results, the authors proposed that the cis-acting element DCS-PK enhances viral replication by regulating genome cyclization, and that DCS-PK might interact with other cis-acting elements to form a functional viral RNA cyclization domain, thus playing a critical role during the flavivirus life cycle.",

Using thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses, it was predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem\u2013loop structure (designated SL6) with an exposed conserved hexanucleotide among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). To investigate the role of SL6, a TBEV infectious clone was used to introduce nucleotide substitutions which altered either the linear sequence of the unpaired apical loop or destabilized the base-paired stem. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem while point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, the fact that all mutants eventually reached the titer of wild-type virus late post-infection demonstrated that the SL6 REE is not essential for growth in tissue culture but acts to up-regulate virus replication.",

Due to its impressive safety record and high efficacy as a human vaccine, the attenuated YFV 17D strain has been used as the backbone for the construction of some of these chimeric vaccine viruses (see Fig. 6\n). First developed by Chambers et al. (1999) and Monath et al. (1999) for the generation of YFV/JEV chimera (Chambers et al., 1999, Monath et al., 1999), YFV-based chimeric candidate vaccines have been subsequently constructed for DENV (Caufour et al., 2001, Guirakhoo et al., 2000, Guirakhoo et al., 2001, Guirakhoo et al., 2006, van Der Most et al., 2000), JEV (Monath et al., 1999, Monath et al., 2003), WNV (Arroyo et al., 2004, Monath et al., 2001, Monath et al., 2006) and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (Pugachev et al., 2004) and have now been extensively tested in clinical trials with results that demonstrate their immunogenicity and good safety profile (Guy et al., 2008, Guy et al., 2010). Structural genes were either derived from wild type (WT) viruses (e.g., DENV and veterinary WNV vaccine candidates) or from empirically derived attenuated vaccines (e.g., JEV strain SA14-14-2) or by introduction of specific attenuating mutations into the wild-type E gene by site directed mutagenesis (e.g., NY99 strain for development of a human WNV vaccine). The JEV strain SA14-14-2 has also been used as the backbone to produce DENV-2/JEV, WNV/JEV or TBEV/JEV attenuated chimeras (Li et al., 2013a, Li et al., 2013b, Wang et al., 2014).

For example, resistant mutants obtained in cellulo by passaging the virus with increased concentrations of antiviral drug, can be characterized using reverse genetics methods with infectious clones. By introducing the candidate mutations into the genome of the infectious clone the resistance phenotype of each mutated virus can be determined. This approach was used to characterize the antiviral properties of brequinar (BQR) using DENV (Qing et al., 2010). After appropriate mutant selection in cell culture, followed by sequencing and appropriate mutagenesis of the infectious clones, it was demonstrated that a mutation in either the envelope or NS5 gene confers BQR resistance. Mechanistically, the envelope mutation renders the mutant virus less susceptible to BQR inhibition during the assembly/release phase whereas the NS5 mutation confers resistance through enhancement of viral RNA synthesis.",

Sequencing analyses of isolated resistant mutants identified a consensus amino acid substitution (E66G) present within the NS3 protease domain. Introduction of this mutation into a DENV-2 infectious clone resulted in the apparition of the resistance phenotype to BP13944. The location of the mutation, within the interface between the protease and helicase domains of the DENV NS3 protein, indicates that BP13944 may affect DENV replication by binding to the protease interface (Yang et al., 2014).",
