As the global human population increases, so will anthropogenic pressures on wildlife and the environment, augmenting the likelihood of zoonotic pathogen spillover from animal to human populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies zoonoses as emerging threats and describe them as previously occurring phenomena that have an increasing trend and expansion in geographical, host or vector range. More than 60 % of all emerging infectious diseases are from zoonoses (Mackenzie and Jeggo, 2013). Despite acting as the main reservoir for only 3 % of the known zoonoses, humans are the main source of identification for disease outbreaks (Frank, 2008). As such, epidemiological relationships between animal and human outbreaks can be exploited to strengthen veterinary and public health response efficiencies via the integration of animal and human surveillance systems (Stone and Hautala, 2008).",

They frequently respond to agents in an analogous manner to humans and manifest similar disease symptoms. Some animals have biologically compressed lifespans, consequently developing clinical signs more rapidly after exposure to specific pathogens. Furthermore, they may be more susceptible to contaminants than humans and they do not share some human behaviors that may confound investigation results (e.g. smoking). Table 1\nprovides a list of websites containing information related to the use of animals for surveillance. Proper utilization of animals for surveillance may allow the early identification of epidemics, which facilitates mitigation of its magnitude, or prevention of its occurrence (Chomel, 2003, Kahn, 2006). This is due to the ability of animals to: 1) exhibit changes in the occurrence or prevalence of a pathogen or disease with time, 2) serve as markers for on-going exposure risk, 3) allow examination of hypotheses on the ecology of pathogens, and 4) provide information on the efficiency of disease control measures (McCluskey, 2003).",

They can be utilized in passive, active or sentinel surveillance programs. Passive (reactive) surveillance involves the spontaneous reporting of disease data from the animal sector to veterinary authorities (Hoinville et al., 2013). Data reported can include illnesses or deaths in animals, or notifiable diseases that must be reported by law. The data is then analyzed to observe disease trends and identify potential outbreaks. Active (proactive) surveillance on the other hand involves calling on animal facilities to interview workers and to review animal health records to identify diseases under surveillance.

Passive surveillance is best employed when the objective of the program is targeted towards early detection of outbreaks or monitoring the extent of disease for making decisions on control strategies; whereas, active surveillance is best employed when a disease is targeted for elimination. Passive surveillance is the least time consuming, labor intensive and expensive of the three forms of surveillance, and covers an extensive range. However, because it relies heavily on reports from veterinarians who receive little incentive for reporting, the data reported is frequently incomplete and delayed. Underreporting of disease suspicions is also known to be a major cause of disease control failure (FAO, 2011) and multiple studies have been conducted to better comprehend the decision-making processes behind underreporting so as to develop recommendations for improved passive surveillance (Bronner et al., 2014, Delabouglise et al., 2016, Paul et al., 2013, Sawford et al., 2012, Thompson et al., 2016). In contrast, active surveillance demands more time and resources and is thus less commonly employed. However, it provides more complete and accurate data than passive surveillance. A study comparing active and passive animal surveillance in Chad concluded that for monitoring of existing diseases, the less expensive passive surveillance is better suited for Chad\u2019s conditions. Whereas, for monitoring of rare diseases, active surveillance of animal herds is required to complete passive surveillance (Ouagal et al., 2010).",

A classic example of an animal sentinel system is the well-known canary in the coalmine (Burrell and Seibert, 1914). Canaries are sensitive to the effects of poisonous gases, particularly carbon monoxide, and were routinely taken into the mines to warn of dangers. Its inclination to sing much of the time, coupled with its brightly colored plumage offered both \u201caudio and visual\u201d cues to the miners. If the canary stopped singing and/or fell from its perch, this was the signal for the miners to don their respirators or evacuate. Many miners owe their existence and livelihood to this historic animal sentinel.",

For example, on March 20, 1995, the Tokyo underground trains were hit by synchronized chemical terrorist attacks (National Research Council of the National Academies, 2005). The Aum Shinrikyo religious sect dispensed a concoction of military nerve agent, Sarin, killing twelve and injuring thousands. As a precaution, the Japanese policemen carried canaries \u2212 the very primitive animal sentinel \u2212 in cages with them to warn of the presence of toxic gases during raids. Another recent example of the use of avian species as sentinels of toxic chemical exposures was in 2003, when U.S. Marine Corps employed chicken sentinels at the Kuwaiti staging area despite the deployment of automated detectors (Ember, 2003). The chickens were employed to complement the M22 ion-mobility spectrometer, which was used to tag nerve and blister agents.

For example, chickens have been used as sentinels for the surveillance of arboviruses like West Nile Virus (WNV), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses (Moore et al., 1993). They are amenable to and can tolerate arboviral infections with little or no symptoms, developing antibodies within a week of being bitten by an infected mosquito. They produce low tittered viremia, are cheap to purchase, robust and easily bled (biweekly or monthly during the peak season from June to October), making them excellent sentinel animals of arboviruses. Despite providing accurate spatiotemporal information on virus transmission, the relationship between mosquito transmission and percentage of bird and mosquito infections in a particular region still needs to be determined in order to precisely evaluate human risk. In order to improve their use as sentinels, chicken interferon-\u03b1 can be administered perorally in drinking water, where it acts as an adjuvant, inducing rapid seroconversion in chickens after infection by low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). These chickens are called \u2018super-sentinels\u2019 since they are able to detect clinically inapparent LPAI (Marcus et al., 2007). LPAI strains are the most widespread, and can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains, which can lead to human transmission and potential fatalities. Thus, by placing super-sentinel chickens in locations prone to bird flu outbreaks, for example live-bird markets, this would allow early detection of LPAI, thereby buying time for its control.",

For example, the Mussel Watch Program actively analyzes sediment and bivalve tissue chemistry for a suite of organic contaminants and trace metals to identify trends at over 300 selected U.S. coastal sites from 1986 to today. It is designed to identify deleterious changes in the marine habitat and indicate potential human health concerns (Kim et al., 2008). Anomalocardia brasiliana is also a good surveillance tool for actively monitoring contamination levels of coliforms in shellfish harvesting regions in Brazil\u2019s northeast coast (Lima-Filho et al., 2015). Mussels, clams and oysters are particularly suitable for us as surveillance tools because they are able to bioaccumulate many chemicals (O\u2019Connor and Lauenstein, 2006), as well as concentrate microbial organisms and pathogens (Kueh and Chan, 1985) to concentrations in excess of 1000 fold (Grodzki et al., 2014). Thus, the high concentrations of chemical and pathogens make it easier to detect environmental and health threats in these organisms. Moreover, improved sequencing technologies have led to the monitoring of bivalves via genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics (Suarez-Ulloa et al., 2013). Such integrative omic studies will make powerful tools in the biomonitoring of marine pollution.",

In 1956, Japanese veterinarians discovered a neurological disease in cats in the Minamata fishing village (Takeuchi et al., 1977). It was called \u201cdancing cat fever\u201d because the cats displayed convulsions and involuntary jumping movements. However, this disease was not investigated rigorously until similar symptoms also manifested in the people of Minamata. As a result of subsequent epidemiologic studies in Minamata, researchers realised that effluent from a factory had polluted surrounding waters resulting in the accumulation of mercury in fish. Subsequent consumption of contaminated fish by fishermen and their families resulted in high mercury concentrations in their brains, kidneys and livers. Had the authorities paid more attention to the cats\u2019 disease symptoms, this could have been prevented. Nevertheless, this episode raised the awareness of cats as a surveillance tool for monitoring mercury poisoning, food safety and public health throughout the world. Besides mercury poisoning, there have been increasing numbers of reports of human or animal illnesses or deaths associated with harmful cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater systems. Hence, in a similar way, the surveillance of fish, dogs or livestock can provide important early warnings of cyanobacteria-associated environmental hazards (Hilborn and Beasley, 2015).",

During that period, the community was alarmed by the sudden death of more than 9000 birds. This sparked an urgent investigation which eventually revealed that the birds had died of lead poisoning. The lead ore concentrate had originated from the handling of lead carbonate concentrate at the Megallan mine 600 km north of Esperance. The Western Australia Department of Health and Local Shire Council measured lead concentrations in rainwater from household tanks (the main source of drinking water) and discovered that 10% of households had lead concentrations exceeding WHO guidelines of 10 \u03bcg/L.

During those periods, the unusually high numbers of encephalitis cases in humans was concurrent with a surge in dying crows with neurological symptoms similar to encephalitis patients (Eidson et al., 2001). This prompted investigations, which identified WNV as the cause of the outbreak, and demarcated its geographical limits since the crows were amplification hosts for viral transmission. The CDC, U.S. Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Centre and U.S. Department of Agriculture have since been involved in the battle against WNV. Strategies are currently in place to consolidate data on human, mosquito, bird, chicken and veterinary cases of West Nile infection in the Arbonet system (U.S. Geological Survey and CDC, 2016). Other than birds, dogs could also act as surveillance tools for monitoring WNV circulation. Seroconversion was detected in juvenile dogs 6 weeks before WNV appeared in humans in Houston, Texas (Resnick et al., 2008). Hence, active surveillance of WNV seroprevalence in birds and dogs can be used for monitoring WNV activity.",

This new strain resulted when a triple reassortment of Northern American swine, bird and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus (Trifonov et al., 2009). Also in 2009 was the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak which led to the intense surveillance of wild ducks for avian flu viruses in Europe (Globig et al., 2009). In Eastern Asia, wild swans are an ideal surveillance species as there is vast geographical overlap between whooper swan distributions and H5N1 outbreak areas (Newman et al., 2009). Other hosts of HPAI include cats and dogs (Cleaveland et al., 2006, Kuiken et al., 2005).

Indeed, viral sequencing revealed nucleotide polymorphism signatures, indicative of cross-species transmission (Chu et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2014). This suggests that human MERS-CoV infections could have been zoonotically acquired from camels and that their surveillance could reveal MERS-CoV foci.",

Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, which has fatality rates of near 100 % in both humans and animals, has been identified by CDC as one of the most likely biological agents to be used (CDC, 2016). Moreover, anthrax can form resilient spores that persist for decades in soil. During WWII, the British government was experimenting the use of anthrax on Gruinard Island. Despite efforts to decontaminate the island, the long-lasting contamination of the soil by anthrax spores put the island under quarantine for 48 years before it was considered safe for human use (\u201cBritain\u2019s Anthrax Island,\u201d 2001). This highlights the importance of passively monitoring random cases in animals to identify anthrax hot spots. In 1979, B. anthracis spores were inadvertently released from a Soviet military microbiology facility in Sverdlovsky (Meselson et al., 1994). Livestock 60 km away from the plant died, whereas human cases occurred within 4 km downwind of the facility. Analysis showed that the dosage of B. anthracis at which sheep and cows became ill was more than an order of magnitude lower than the dosage required to affect humans. This analysis therefore suggests that livestock are much more susceptible than humans to B. anthracis and would be ideal for use as surveillance tools for B. anthracis since lower dosages at greater distances from the source were sufficient to affect the animals.",

It appeared in humans in the U.S. in the 1900s (Link, 1955, Lipson, 1972), and became established enzootically in wild rodents by the mid-1940s. It is hypothesized that plague is maintained by reservoir species like rodents, and that carnivores become ill following the ingestion of plague-infected rodents. In 2005, 5 plague cases were confirmed in the Yulong County of the Yunnan Province, China (Li et al., 2008).

It is therefore important to have a framework for the proper evaluation of animals to determine if they are suitable for use as sentinels for surveillance. To this end, the Halliday et al. (2007) conceptual framework effectively evaluates animals as sentinel populations for various surveillance aims and ecological settings (Halliday et al., 2007). There are three fundamental components of the sentinel framework: the pathogen under surveillance, the target population, and the sentinel population. The sentinel framework produces a sentinel response which could take the form of seroconversion, current infection, morbidity, mortality and changes in morphology or behavior. In addition to the sentinel response, other sentinel practical factors and host factors also influence the detectability of the sentinel response, which eventually determines the utility of the sentinel. As alluded to earlier, although there are numerous benefits in using animal sentinels, its use is associated with ethical concerns which might be alleviated by the surveillance of existing animals in their natural habitats.",

A likely reason is that human and animal health surveillance efforts mostly stem from disparate initiatives, resulting in data being kept in entirely separate databases (Scotch et al., 2009). There is thus an increasing need for interdisciplinary integration between human and veterinary medicine, and communication before we can completely exploit the benefits of animals for surveillance (Bisdorff et al., 2016, Wendt et al., 2015). To this end, committees have been established to increase awareness of the mutual reliance between human, animal, plant, microbial, and ecosystem health (Rabinowitz et al., 2013). This includes the \u2018One Medicine\u2019 or \u2018One Health\u2019 initiatives like the One Health Commission, the One Health Initiative and the Comparative Clinical Science Foundation (Zinsstag et al., 2011). The term \u2018One Medicine\u2019 was coined in 1976 by Calvin W. Schwabe in recognition of the mutualism of human and animal health, nutrition and livelihood (Schwabe, 1984). This mutualism is further supported by the close genomic relationship of humans and animals (Peters et al., 2007). Today, the appreciation of the interdependence of the well-being and health of humans, animals and the ecosystems, evolved the term \u2018One Medicine\u2019 towards \u2018One Health\u2019, to include public health, ecology and broader societal dimensions (Zinsstag et al., 2011).",

It also established infrastructure and expertise required for the operation of pandemic threat surveillance and diagnostics to support the One Health Workforce (OHW). The huge success of EPT led to the launch of EPT 2 which aims to discover diseases of known and unknown origin; minimize the possibility of disease outbreaks by reducing human activities that promote disease spillover; boost national readiness; and ultimately to reduce the repercussions of novel zoonotic pathogen emergence (USAID, 2016b).",

It is therefore critical that they continue to collaborate with partners like the CDC, WHO, OHW, Food and Agriculture of the United Nations, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge and Lao-Oxford-Mahosot Hospital-Wellcome Trust Research Unit, to strengthen their capacity in surveillance and laboratory capabilities, and to ensure that efforts are not replicated. It is also important that One Health programs continue to receive the support and funds that they need to sustain their work. The extent of support for animal disease surveillance in communities is largely built upon its understanding of the dangers of zoonoses to human health, trade and the economy, rather than out of interest in wildlife health. Accordingly, it is crucial to boost public awareness of the importance of wildlife health to societies. Lastly, governments are occasionally unwilling to announce potential disease outbreaks for various reasons, including preventing the disruption of trade. Hence, it is important that reporting of wildlife diseases be standardized and made necessary, and for a reporting global clearinghouse to be established.",
