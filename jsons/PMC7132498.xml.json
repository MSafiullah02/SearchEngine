In contrast, resources for emerging food-borne diseases have tended to be allocated in an incident driven manner, i.e. in response to the extent of perceived emerging health threat (for example BSE). In an attempt to reduce disease burden, the monitoring of food-borne diseases and pathogens in the food chain has been implemented and a farm-to-fork approach has been adopted encouraging all sectors of the food production chain to improve hygiene and actively incorporate structured approaches to food safety, such as HACCP principles. Underlying such industry-based changes has been an enormous research effort leading to the generation of improved methods for the diagnosis of intestinal disease and the detection of food-borne pathogens. Over the last 20 years this research has also used modern technology to generate genome sequences, identify pathogenic mechanisms, provide evidence-based risk assessments for policy development and even develop some effective intervention strategies such as vaccines for food-producing animals or post-harvest treatments. With all this input, a substantial downwards trend in food-borne disease, should be expected. However, evidence from disease surveillance for such a positive impact remains sparse.",

Comprehensive diagnostic studies of intestinal infectious diseases (see for example Tompkins et al., 1999), indicate that between 50 and 60% of all causative agents are unidentified. In addition, gastrointestinal illnesses caused by toxin producing bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, are almost certainly underestimated due to lack of diagnostic tools. The only certainty is that the list of agents of infectious intestinal disease will continue to grow as new microbes are recognised and as food processing and eating habits change. Before 1960 the major causes of gastrointestinal disease were recognised as Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus. During the 1960s Clostridium perfringens, and B\n.\ncereus were added and then in the 1970s, rotavirus and norovirus. In the 1980s and 1990s there was a flurry of additions including Campylobacter, Yersinia, Listeria monocytogenes, new strains of Escherichia coli such as O157:H7, Cryptosporidia and Cyclospora. It seems highly probable that new food-borne pathogens will be discovered in the 21st century. Many of these will be zoonotic in origin given that such pathogens are twice as likely to cause new and emerging diseases than non-zoonotic agents. In addition, already known pathogens can evolve thereby adding to the public health risks. For example zoonotic food-borne bacteria are increasingly becoming resistant to antimicrobials.",

A continued decline in diarrhoeal disease as a cause of death, particularly in the young, is a prediction of the WHO. Such a prediction presumes that the situation regarding food safety will not only be maintained but will be rolled out into those areas of the world increasingly responsible for global food production. However, regardless of the improvements in production, processing and monitoring along the food-chain, few food-borne pathogens, if any, appear to have been successfully contained. Even with the extensive campaign undertaken towards the control of BSE, this disease is still being detected in cattle (www.oie.int/eng/info/en_esbru.htm). Thus despite all the efforts from scientists, governments and industry it appears that food-borne disease will continue as a major public health problem worldwide, with enormous implications for both the social welfare of populations and for national economies.",

This is a reflection of a low infectious dose in humans, especially when delivered in certain foodstuffs such as chocolate, an ability to grow in unprocessed food and in the environment allowing amplification, and long term survival and, therefore, ease of recovery from contaminated foods. Such diverse habitats also provide opportunities for adaptation and evolution and this is demonstrated by the changing trends in salmonellosis and associated agents that have been observed in recent years.",

This increase largely comprised S. enteritidis phage type (PT) 4, which was epidemiologically and microbiologically linked to shell eggs and poultry. Research has demonstrated that this Salmonella has adapted to preferentially colonise the avian reproductive tract, persist in the ovary and oviduct and survive in hen's eggs (Gantois et al., 2008). The effectiveness of such a strategy for the success of this agent is remarkable. Intervention against S. enteritidis PT4 in the form of hygiene interventions, including the culling of infected flocks using a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach and vaccination, first of breeder flocks and then of layers. This significantly reduced egg-associated infections during the late 1990s in several European countries but from 2000 there has been further increase in salmonellosis, this time with non-PT4 strains, including PT1, PT14B and PT21. Outbreak data, coupled with extensive laboratory investigations, has suggested that at least some of these strains are once again associated with egg contamination. Thus as one Salmonella type is controlled, others appear to evolve to fill the gap in what is obviously a very useful niche for this organism.",

Few European countries have consistent and long-term data on campylobacteriosis but in the United Kingdom case reports have been recorded since 1982. Infections increased year on year until 2000 after which there was a drop of about 20% until 2004.

Because under reporting of campylobacteriosis is significant (Tompkins et al., 1999), community-based changes in public health attitudes and resources could readily influence trends. It is tempting to consider that interventions introduced to prevent and control campylobacteriosis have had an effect. Certainly since the early 1980s enormous effort has gone into identifying and controlling the sources of infection. This effort has been largely focussed on the poultry industry as Campylobacter contamination of poultry meat from colonised chickens is considered the major source. National strategic plans have been adopted in several countries targeted at the on-farm, processing and kitchen hygiene levels. However, there are no available consistent interventions to prevent or reduce poultry infection on the farm and the implementation of available post-harvest interventions, such as use of hyper-chlorinated water washes, has been limited (for example in Europe, by legislation). To date a few, mainly Scandinavian (particularly Iceland and Norway), countries have managed to substantially reduce poultry flock prevalence, which has allowed the separation and post-harvest treatment of broiler meat from positive flocks to be economically viable. In New Zealand the focus has been on post-harvest interventions mainly by the introduction of hyper-chlorinated water washes and targets for carcass contamination. Surveillance in these countries suggests that such major strategic efforts can be effective, but only in part. The reason for this is unclear but may indicate that other sources are also important.",

Such outbreaks increased dramatically and became widespread in the following years. It has been estimated that in the United States, E. coli O157:H7 causes 73,000 illnesses (Mead et al., 1999) and 250 deaths annually. The first recognized community outbreak of O157:H7 in Europe occurred in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1985 and further outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported throughout Europe ever since. In England and Wales, 33% of outbreaks are food-borne (Gillespie et al., 2005). In the early outbreaks the sources were most often found to be contaminated beef meat, often minced, and the organism is widespread in the guts of asymptomatic cattle. As a reflection of the seriousness of such outbreaks, extensive legislation, new food handling practices and food-producer education have been introduced and implemented over the last 20 years. Despite these, large outbreaks still occur mainly due to producer incompetence; most recently an outbreak among schoolchildren in south Wales in 2005 involved 157 cases, with the death of a five year old school boy (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6983113.stm). Professor Pennington, who chaired the subsequent enquiry, stated \u201cThe requirements for food hygiene that were in place at the time of the Outbreak should have been sufficient to prevent it.\u201d (http://wales.gov.uk/ecoliinquiry/?lang=en). So it seems that even though lessons have been learnt, and processes changed accordingly, outbreaks cannot be avoided. Also, importantly, risk factor studies indicate a shift from contaminated meat products towards environmental transmission in some countries, such as via contact with farm animals or gardening (Coia et al., 1998). This could constitute major future challenges for public health interventions of this potentially serious disease.",

A particular MRSA strain, so-called NT (\u201cnon-typeable\u201d by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) MRSA or sequence type (ST) 398 (by MLST), has increasingly been isolated from pigs and pig farmers. Currently an EU-wide baseline study of the prevalence of MRSA in breeder pigs is ongoing to better understand the epidemiology of this emerging strain in Europe. A recent Dutch study showed that MRSA can be detected at very low concentrations (< 10 cfu/g) in unheated meats from various domestic animals and fowl. This survey indicated that the overall prevalence of MRSA was 11.9% of 2217 retail samples of raw meat, with highest prevalence in poultry meat. For all meat types, the MRSA strains were predominantly (85%) of the NT ST398 type (de Boer et al., 2009). Thus, other livestock may be a significant source of MRSA. Nevertheless, it is currently unclear to what degree the MRSA types in animals, and in particular the emerging clone ST398, are food safety, or even public health, risks.",

When antimicrobial therapy is initiated, it is important to choose the appropriate antimicrobial product and administration route.

Nevertheless, significant progress has been achieved in some foods such as shellfish and for outbreak investigations. However, the results can lead to confusion because virus-positive foods may comply with regulations based on the testing of coliforms. Thus foods may pass regulatory requirements on the basis of bacterial content but still constitute a public health risk because of the presence of pathogenic viruses. Moreover, results from food testing and patient testing may be discordant due to the presence of multiple strains and PCR-based detection may be disputed because it does not provide information about the viability of the target organism.

Modern food production requires a risk-based approach in which several critical control points are monitored. Parasite-free farming implies strict indoor housing of animals including pest control, proper feed preparation and storage, and general hygienic measures. Such an approach is effective to prevent Trichinella infections in swine and might also be effective to prevent other food-borne infections such as Toxoplasma.

The mechanisms involved are complex and varied but all are able to survive intervening periods in the environment, and then avoid the human innate gut defenses to colonize and multiply rapidly before enabling effective dispersal, frequently through fluid feces, back into the environment to progress again through the cycle.
