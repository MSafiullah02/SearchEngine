Depending on the virus type and subtype, experimental infection can be induced in mice, ferrets, chickens, swine, and primates, and the viruses can be propagated in primary cultures of kidney cells, continuous cell lines (MDCK, Vero, PER.C6, and LLC-MK2), and also in embryonated hen's eggs.20 The biologic property of influenza viruses to bind erythrocytes is exploited for early detection of the virus in cell culture and for the development of serologic assays by hemagglutination inhibition.20 Influenza viruses are inactivated by temperatures above 50\u00b0C and by lipid solvents, acid, formaldehyde, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet (UV) light.20\n",

Major antigenic changes in influenza A are called antigenic shift and result in the emergence of a novel HA subtype with or without new NA to which humans lack significant immunity.18 This may be caused by the acquisition of new gene segments through genetic reassortment in a host infected simultaneously by a human and an animal (typically avian) virus, or by reappearance of a subtype from reservoir. Swine are susceptible to both avian and human influenza viruses and may be hosts for reassortment or serve as the mammalian species in which avian viruses can adapt. Novel influenza virus subtypes generated by shift have caused catastrophic pandemics, including three in the last century.

Reye's syndrome occurs in fewer than 1 per 100,000 cases of influenza in patients under 18 years of age following the use of salicylates. Pregnant women, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, and other immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk for severe disease and complications.20\n",

The severity of illness broadly correlates with upper respiratory tract viral levels. Constitutional symptoms with influenza are due in part to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Levels of interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins and chemokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-10, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2) are increased in nasal secretions, and IFN, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are increased in blood in human influenza.20 The tissue tropism of a strain of influenza virus depends, among other factors, on a combination of susceptibility of its HA to be cleaved by, and tissue availability of proteases with specificity to cleave it, thus rendering the virus infectious.32 Extrapulmonary dissemination of virus has been uncommonly documented in humans, but systemic spread is a regular feature of highly pathogenic avian viruses in chickens and sometimes in rodents or other mammalian hosts. Serum and secretory antibodies directed to HA and NA appear about 10 days after infection. Protection against reinfection by the homologous strain is durable following natural infection and is correlated with serum and nasal neutralizing antibody levels, principally directed against HA. Vaccine-induced protection may last for up to 2 to 3 years against homotypic virus. Infection also induces cell-mediated immunity, which is detectable 3 to 6 days after infection and seems to be important for recovery.30 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against internal proteins may provide some degree of heterosubtypic immunity.",

A higher index of suspicion and laboratory diagnostics is needed outside the season, particularly in sporadic individual cases or unexplained outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness. Viral isolation from respiratory specimens can be done in several types of cells (e.g., PRMK, MDCK, LLC-MK2) and remains the current standard.20 The presence of virus may be detected in cell cultures by hemadsorption with guinea pig erythrocytes before or after cytopathic effect (CPE) is visible. Blind hemadsorption is positive 3 days after inoculation in almost all positive samples.20 Confirmation of isolates can be done by hemagglutination inhibition or immunofluorescence with type- specific antisera. Diagnosis can also be made in 1 to 2 days by immunofluorescence of monolayers of MDCK cells inoculated by centrifugation (shell-vial).33 Conserved influenza antigens (M or NP) directly in clinical samples can be detected by one of several techniques (e.g., immunofluorescence [IF], enzyme immunoassay [EIA]), and multiple point-of-care kits are commercially available with turnaround time of 15 to 30 minutes. One commercial assay is based on detection of influenza- specific NA activity. The sensitivities of these assays are higher in children (up to 90%) than in adults (generally 50% to 70%) and depend on duration of illness and sample type.20\n",

Amantadine is excreted in an unchanged state in the urine, while rimantadine is extensively metabolized after absorption and less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Elderly persons need only half the dose to achieve similar plasma levels. Amantadine or rimantadine may cause gastrointestinal upset and central nervous system side effects. Central nervous system (CNS) intolerance is more common with amantadine and, when severe, can be manifested as agitation, psychosis, seizures, and coma. Mild complaints including insomnia, dizziness, anxiety, dry mouth, anorexia, and nausea are reversible upon discontinuation. Amantadine and rimantadine are marketed as 100-mg tablets and 10-mg/mL syrup. The recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily for adults older than 65 years of age (100 mg/day for patients \u226565 years of age). For children under age 10 years, a rimantadine dose of 5 mg/kg/day (maximum, 150 mg/day) has been suggested.20 Dose reductions proportional to the creatinine clearance (ClCr) are suggested for patients with renal insufficiency (amantadine for ClCr <60 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m2; rimantadine for ClCr <10 to 20 mL/min/1.73 m2). Influenza virus resistant to amantadine-rimantadine emerges in approximately one third of treated patients; such viruses are transmissible to close contacts and cause typical influenza illness. Resistance to these drugs renders them ineffective and is sometimes present naturally, including in recent human isolates of H5N1 virus.20\n",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the immunization of persons aged 50 years and older; residents of nursing homes; children and adults with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, including asthma; persons chronically ill with diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, or hemoglobinopathies; immunosuppressed patients including those with HIV infection; children and adolescents on chronic aspirin therapy who may develop postinfluenza Reye's syndrome; women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; children aged 6 to 23 months; those who can transmit influenza to persons at high risk, such as health-care workers and household contacts of those at high risk including children 0 to 23 months of age; crew members of cruise ships; providers of essential services; and unimmunized travelers to areas where influenza may be circulating, including the tropics, the southern hemisphere between April and September, and those traveling in large organized tourist groups. In addition, vaccine is made available to anyone interested in reducing the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza.20,\n39 The inactivated vaccine, administered as a single intramuscular (IM) dose shortly before influenza season (two doses in previously unimmunized children <9 years of age), is safe during pregnancy but should be avoided in persons with history of anaphylactic reactions to eggs.39 Vaccine safety and efficacy in children has been extensively evaluated and has shown a favorable safety profile with efficacy in 1- to 15-year-old children of 77% to 91%. Inactivated vaccine is not currently recommended for children younger than 6 months, but vaccination of household contacts and caregivers should reduce the risk of these high-risk children contracting influenza.

Antigenic differences in the surface glycoprotein G permit the classification of RSV into groups A and B, each with antigenic subgroups.46 The interaction of RSV envelope glycoprotein G with glycosaminoglycans enables adherence to the cell surface. However, G protein\u2013independent mechanisms of attachment must exist, since mutants devoid of G protein can also enter host cells. RSV enters the cell by fusion of viral envelope with cell membranes, a process mediated by binding of the viral F protein to the cell GTPase RhoA.46 The syncytia resulting from fusion of the infected cells to adjacent ones are the major feature of the cytopathic effect of paramyxoviruses. Once in the cytoplasm, the negative-strand RNA is transcribed by viral transcriptase into mRNAs, which then direct viral protein synthesis. An intermediate positive-strand full-length cRNA serves as a template for the synthesis of progeny negative-strand RNA. As they bud through the cell membrane, the virions acquire a glycoprotein-containing envelope.46 RSV causes asymptomatic infection in a variety of experimental animals, but natural infection occurs only in humans and chimpanzees.47 RSV grows well in several human heteroploid cell lines, such as HEp-2, HeLa, and A549, and is sensitive to ether, chloroform, detergents, and a pH less than 5. RSV is inactivated at 55\u00b0C, survives poorly on porous surfaces, and loses infectivity significantly by slow freezing and storage at temperatures above 4\u00b0C.46\n",

Pulse oximetry has been advocated to assess oxygen needs, but in tropical developing areas, where oximeters may not be available, serial clinical assessment is essential to monitor disease progression. For this purpose, crackles and cyanosis seem to correlate better with hypoxemia than tachypnea and intercostal retraction.54 Correction of hypoxemia can be accomplished with 40% or lower oxygen concentrations.45 Oxygen should be humidified with saline and delivered by mask if head boxes or tents are unavailable.

However, available evidence indicates that HRV is frequently associated with ARI in children in Brazil. In Fortaleza, a city in northeast Brazil, HRV detected by isolation in cell culture represented 46% of the viruses in children under 5 years of age with ARI.3 In Salvador, another city in the same region, HRV represented 52% of the viruses detected by RT-PCR in association with ARI in children younger than 2 years of age attending a day-care center for the underprivileged.11 Data on the frequency of HRV among adults in tropical countries are even more scarce. In Singapore, HRV was detected in 20% of the samples obtained from adults with ARI symptoms attending primary care centers.81\n",

SARS-CoV is phylogenetically different and equidistant from all previously known coronaviruses, but isolates from different origins are relatively homogeneous genetically. Genome analysis reveals that SARS-CoV is neither a host-range mutant nor a recombinant of previously known coronaviruses but rather an independently emerged virus.

The use of high-dose steroid therapy is controversial and for the most part supported by anecdotal evidence, whereas the use of ribavirin is based on the broad antiviral spectrum of the drug. However, SARS-CoV is only modestly susceptible to ribavirin in vitro, and therapeutic doses are difficult to achieve clinically. Since it became possible to grow SARS-CoV in culture, many potential antiviral compounds have been evaluated in vitro, but just a few have been tested in animal models and even fewer are in clinical testing.131\nInterferons (IFN-\u03b1n1/n3, leukocytic IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2) and HIV protease inhibitors were consistently active in vitro and may be considered for animal testing and clinical trials.131\n",

At day 21 after onset of symptoms, development of ARDS or death was significantly less frequent in the group treated with the combination (2.3%) than in historical controls (28.8%). In addition, peak viral loads in respiratory samples and stools were reduced in the group treated with the combination as compared with controls.145 However, since there were differences in outcome predictors, such as sex, platelet counts, and LDH levels, between the two groups, these results should be interpreted with caution.",

It has been shown that SARS-CoV spike protein produced in bacteria and expressed on chimeric parainfluenza virus, as well as spike protein\u2013encoding DNA, induced neutralizing antibodies and protected experimental animals from challenge with live virus. At present, no SARS-CoV vaccine is available for human use.

Although SARS infectiousness relative to the onset and termination of clinical symptoms has not been accurately determined, it is clear that shortening the time from onset to hospital admission and isolation reduces the risk of transmission, thus contributing substantially to curtailing of outbreaks. Identification of new cases through contact tracing played an important role in the control of the outbreaks registered so far. Stringent isolation procedures must be adopted for confirmed and suspected cases, which require a high level of alertness among health-care workers for early identification of SARS cases. The scenario may be further complicated in situations in which other diseases such as influenza and Hantavirus pulmonary infections may occur simultaneously.135\n",
