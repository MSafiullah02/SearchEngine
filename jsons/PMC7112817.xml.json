            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described, emerging infectious disease presenting with high fever and atypical pneumonia. The disease first appeared in the Guangdong province of China and quickly spread to other countries; outbreaks were reported in mainland China, Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Canada (Drazen, 2003, Lee et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003, Tsang et al., 2003, Vu et al., 2003, WHO, 2003a). A new, previously unknown coronavirus was first isolated from patients with SARS at the University of Hong-Kong (Peiris et al., 2003a, WHO, 2003a); this was quickly followed by reports from several other laboratories of the demonstration of a new coronavirus in samples from patients with SARS (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003, WHO, 2003a). The complete genomic sequence of the virus has been determined (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003) and confirmed the classification of the SARS-associated agent as a new coronavirus, distinct from the previously known groups of coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003) but with some relationship with group 2 (Snijder et al., 2003). Experimental infection of cynomolgous monkeys permitted the fulfillment of Koch's postulates for this pathogen and firmly established the SARS-associated human coronavirus (SARS-HCoV) as the etiologic agent of SARS (Fouchier et al., 2003).",

This single-tube RT-PCR is based on consensus primers targeting conserved regions of coronavirus genome sequences and allows for the detection and species identification of several coronaviruses including SARS-HCoV, with high analytical sensitivity. This assay is expected to be helpful in fulfilling the World Health Organization laboratory case definition of SARS, which recommends the use of two different PCR assays (WHO, 2003b). In addition, even if the SARS-HCoV does not reappear in the human population, this assay will still be useful, since it provides a diagnostic test for the respiratory coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.",

Although not all the known coronavirus species were tested, it is expected that the primer pair can amplify with high analytical sensitivity the targeted genome segment from the 12 species used in the design of the primers, with the possible exception of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) whose sequence has a mismatch at the third nt from the 3\u2032 end of the primer CORO1 (Fig. 1). The current assay can detect with high sensitivity three coronaviruses known to infect humans, and sequencing of the amplicons would unambiguously identify the species (Fig. 2). Although there has not been yet an opportunity to test this assay on isolates of the newly described HCoV-NL63 (Van der Hoek et al., 2004), it is predicted, based on the sequence alignment in Fig. 1, that our RT-PCR assay would also detect HCoV-NL63, and sequencing of the amplicon followed by phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) would readily confirm the identity of the virus. Based on the published sequence of HCoV-NL63, digestion of the amplicon by AluI would yield a distinct pattern consisting of bands of 187 bp and 33 bp. Since the sequences targeted by the primers CORO1 and CORO2 are conserved across several coronavirus species (and this is particularly clear at the amino acid level), this suggests strong selective pressure on that part of the genome. In turn, this suggests that the assay would still be able to detect mutant or variant strains of SARS-HCoV, as mutations would likely not occur in the regions targeted by the primers. To date, the various isolates of SARS-HCoV have all displayed a great genetic homogeneity (Ruan et al., 2003), which argues for the emergence of SARS-HCoV in the human population only very recently. However, should the virus emerge again and be allowed to propagate, its genetic diversity may well increase (although the genomes of many known coronaviruses appear relatively stable). Of note, a BLAST search in the GenBank database using the 220-nt segment of SARS-HCoV (Fig. 1) showed a 100% homology with 105 sequences of SARS-HCoV deposited to date, including representative of all clusters (Guan et al., 2004), and an homology greater than 99% (219/220) with two other sequences of SARS-HCoV. As well, the recent SARS outbreak suggests that other coronaviruses may emerge as new human pathogens. Again, assuming that the conservation of the sequences targeted by the primers stems from strong evolutionary constraints, the RT-PCR assay described here would very likely detect such an emerging coronavirus.",

Indeed, in all the samples that tested positive for SARS-HCoV in our laboratory during the Toronto outbreak, the expected restriction pattern was demonstrated (and based on sequences deposited in GenBank this pattern would have been demonstrated in all isolates of SARS-HCoV sequenced to date). However, because RNA virus genomes are much more variable than DNA virus genomes, one should not rely completely on such an analysis and the failure to obtain the expected digestion fragments (or if the amplicon is not cut, as is the case for HCoV-OC43) should prompt the determination of the sequence of the amplicon. As an illustrative case in point, whereas the amplicon from the IBV strain Baudette is not cleaved by AluI, the amplicon from strain Massachussetts 41 is in fact cleaved by AluI, as verified by both sequencing and digestion of the amplicon (data not shown). After sequencing the amplicon, a comparison of the sequence to that of several coronaviruses in a phylogenetic analysis, as in Fig. 2, should permit a definitive identification. Indeed, should a new coronavirus emerge, it appears likely that it could be detected and identified as a new virus by using our RT-PCR assay followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.",

While surveillance for SARS is still recommended (WHO, 2003b) there is great concern about the negative impact of a false positive laboratory test, and the World Health Organization has recommended protocols for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS in the post outbreak period (WHO, 2003b), which includes the use of two different RT-PCR assays. The assay described here provides an alternative test that can be helpful in that regard. Furthermore, because our assay detects several coronaviruses, it is quite feasible to use RNA from a coronavirus other than SARS-HCoV as a positive control. In fact, our laboratory now uses as positive control RNA transcribed from the cloned amplicon of the IBV; IBV has never been implicated in human infections. The use of IBV as a positive control removes a potential source of PCR contamination by SARS-HCoV genetic material in the laboratory.",

The number of positive samples reported here is too small to draw firm conclusions but taking into account the distinction between probable and suspected cases of SARS, as well as previous observations made earlier in our laboratory during the outbreak, it appears that the SARS-HCoV is more likely to be demonstrated in lower respiratory tract samples, such as broncho-alveolar lavages or lung biopsies rather than in a nasopharyngeal swab; this parallels the findings of other reports (Peiris et al., 2003b, Tang et al., 2004) and it has been suggested that the SARS-HCoV appears at a high titer in the nasopharynx relatively late in the disease (Peiris et al., 2003b). Thus, the negative RT-PCR results on such samples do not reflect a poor analytical sensitivity of the assay but rather the biology of the virus. A systematic study of various samples obtained throughout the course of the disease in several patients will be required to determine the best testing algorithm. Certainly in the control of the outbreak in Toronto, carefully established epidemiological links between patients fitting the case definition seemed the most effective method, but laboratory confirmation of some cases in the chain also proved to be very helpful (Wallington et al., 2003).",
