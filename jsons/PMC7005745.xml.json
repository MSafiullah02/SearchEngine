The possibility to employ antibiotics to directly target essential processes enabled us to take the lead in the arms race with pathogenic bacteria that have plagued humans for centuries. However, we are on the verge of losing this advantage to the ever-evolving microbes that develop and spread antibiotic resistances with alarming speed. To be able to turn the tide, decisive action needs to be taken. It is important to reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and replace them with pathogen-selective compounds that, in contrast to broad acting agents, do not facilitate acquisition, maintenance and spread of resistance determinants by pathogens and non-virulent bystanders alike. One strategy is to develop therapeutic agents that act on major virulence systems in pathogenic bacteria and thus disarm them and assist the immune defense in clearing the pathogen. The advantage with this strategy is that only the pathogenic bacteria are affected and that the commercial flora is kept intact. In addition, virulence blocking agents are expected to act also on bacterial strains resistant to conventional antibiotics in current use.",

The T3SS is a syringe-like apparatus composed of a basal body spanning the inner and outer membrane of the bacterium and a needle complex protruding from the bacterial surface. Upon host cell contact the system translocates toxins into the cytosol of the eukaryotic cell to induce cell injury, subvert the host defense and promote bacterial proliferation. Antibodies binding to proteins at the tip of the needle structure block T3SS function and promote passive protection in animal infection models1. In addition, mutation of the T3SS reduces infection of eukaryotic cells and mice2,3. The T3SS is conserved among a large number of Gram-negative pathogens and research over the last decades has demonstrated that the T3SS constitutes a validated target for the development of novel pathogen selective therapeutic agents4.",

            "text": "Yersinia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are two Gram-negative bacteria that harbor very homologous T3SS, but each causes very different diseases. Yesinia constitutes eleven species, of which Y. entercolitica, Y. pestis, and Y. pseudotuberculosis are pathogenic to humans5. Y. pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, is probably the most well-known of these since it was the pathogen responsible for the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century. Y. entercolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis cause inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and spread through the fecal-oral route, usually from contaminated food or water. Y. pseudotuberculosis is an excellent model organism to study and explore the T3SS as target for therapeutic intervention. The opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa is the leading cause of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections as well as chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients. In addition, it causes pneumonia and urinary tract, wound, burn, and bloodstream infections. P. aeruginosa is a \u201csuperbug\u201d with a unique capacity to develop resistance6. This is due to a combination of intrinsic, acquired and adaptive resistance. The intrinsic resistance is due to a generally low outer membrane permeability, \u03b2-lactamase production and constitutive expression of efflux pumps. Acquired resistance results from horizontal gene transfer and mutations leading to reduced uptake, efflux pump overexpression, target mutations, and expression of antibiotic modifying enzymes such as extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases. Adaptive resistance is the result of triggering factors such as antibiotics, biocides, polyamines, pH, anaerobiosis, cations, and carbon sources, as well as social behavior in biofilm formation and swarming. These factors modulate expression of genes that lead to increased resistance. This has resulted in multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa strains for which no effective antibiotic treatment is available; moreover, these strains are becoming more frequent.",

            "text": "(-)-Hopeaphenol, a dihydrobenzofuran based resveratrol tetramer, has been isolated from the leaves of the Papua New Guinean rainforest tree Anisoptera thurifera in gram quantities7. We recently established that this natural product has antibacterial activity towards Y. pseudotuberculosis, Chlamydia trachomatis and P. aeruginosa8. In Y. pseudotuberculosis (-)-hopeaphenol irreversibly blocks the T3SS by an unknown mechanism. (-)-Hopeaphenol can be isolated in substantial quantities from natural sources, but in order to establish structure-activity relationships (SARs) and explore the potential for further development, access to analogs is required. However, synthetic efforts toward (-)-hopeaphenol and derivatives have been challenging9,10 due to the complex core structure composed of multiple fused rings and the presence of a number of stereocenters. As a first step, we therefore turned our attention to simplified hopeaphenol-related structures and synthesized (dihydro)benzofuran resveratrol dimers, additional stilbenoid natural products and analogues including viniferifuran, ampelopsin A and B, resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid and anigopreissin A11,12. Moreover, while (-)-hopeaphenol and related compounds compromise the Lipinski rules of 513 and are at the border of \u201chard to optimize\u201d structures beyond the rule of 514, the simplified structures of resveratrol dimers and analogues could be more amendable for further exploration.",

In addition, inhibition of bacterial growth was measured to allow identification of T3SS selective inhibitors with little or no effect on bacterial viability. The results are compiled in Table 1. The direct half of (-)-hopeaphenol (1) i.e. ampelopsin A (2) and B (3) as well as dehydroampelopsin B (4), which all contain a central 7-membered ring structure, showed no or modest inhibition of the T3SS. Similar data was obtained for the related opened form compounds \u03b5-viniferin (5) and \u03c9-viniferin (7) (IC50> 50 \u03bcM, yopE). The related benzofuran based viniferifuran (8), on the other hand, showed good inhibition of the T3SS (Fig. 1) with an IC50 of 10 \u03bcM (yopE) and 4 \u03bcM (YopH), without any effect on bacterial growth, i.e. the inhibition profile is similar to that of the original lead (-)-hopeaphenol. The fact that the inhibition profile of the resveratrol tetramer (-)-hopeaphenol is maintained by the resveratrol dimer viniferifuran is encouraging since it has a simplified structure that can be prepared in gram quantities in only four steps11. The resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid (10) that differs from viniferifuran in its hydroxylation pattern has a similar inhibition profile as viniferifuran in vitro. \u03b4-Viniferin (9) with the stilbene substitution at position 6 displayed a moderate activity (IC50 = 29 \u03bcM, yopE) and the corresponding benzofuran analog dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin (10) was found to be equally potent as viniferifuran. Anigopreissin A (11), with the stilbene group in position 7, inhibits the T3SS, but its detrimental effect on bacterial growth indicates that the inhibition is non-selective (Fig. S1, Table 1). All compounds with a benzofuran core structure i.e. viniferifuran, dehydroampelopsin B, anigopreissin A, dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin and the resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid displayed significant to moderate activities (IC50 = 5\u201340 \u03bcM, yopE).",

A reporter-gene was constructed where the promoter of the P. aeruginosa T3S-toxin, ExoS, was transcriptionally fused to the GFP reporter gene. The gene construct was then cloned into the high copy plasmid pUCP18, together with orf1, coding the chaperon of ExoS15. To be able to select for the plasmid, the gene coding for gentamicin resistant was inserted into the plasmid, creating plasmid pCS500 (Supporting information). The resulting plasmid was inserted into wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PAK and the T3SS activator mutant PAKexsA, resulting in strains that expresses the GFP when the ExoS promoter is activated. The T3SS is induced by incubating the bacteria in calcium depleted medium at 37 \u00b0C. The wild-type PAK and the PAKexsA strains with the reporter plasmid were grown under induced conditions and the compounds were added to the growth medium at different concentrations. After 16 h of incubation the GFP signal was measured in a plate reader (Biotek Synergy) and the inhibition of ExoS expression was calculated. The PAK(pCS500) control (no compound added) showed a high GFP level corresponding to a high expression of exoS, while the PAKexsA(pCS500) control strain showed a low level of GFP corresponding to a low level of exoS expression. The level of GFP seen by the PAKexsA(pCS500) strain was equal to a full inhibition of exoS by a fully active compound (Figure S3). Simultaneously, the inhibition of bacterial growth was measured to select for selective T3SS inhibitors. All compounds with a benzofuran core structure i.e. viniferifuran (8), dehydroampelopsin B (4), anigopreissin A (11), dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin (10) and the resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid (12) exhibited significant activities by inhibiting expression of ExoS in a dose dependent manner, with IC50 values of approximately 8\u201330 \u00b5M (Fig. 4 and Table 2). However, compounds containing the central 7-membered ring structure displayed higher IC50 values, as exemplified by comparison of dehydroampelosin B (4, IC50 33 \u00b5M) and viniferifuran (8, IC50 11 \u00b5M) (Table 2). None of the compounds showed inhibition of bacterial growth and could therefore be considered as selective T3SS inhibitors in P. aeruginosa.",

A T3SS activator mutant or a mutant lacking the T3SS tip protein PcrV is not able to infect eukaryotic cells16,17. The J774 cells (ATCC) were infected with the wild-type PAK strain and the T3SS mutant with or without compounds. The T3SS mediated cytotoxic effect on the eukaryotic cells was measured by using a viability staining method, Uptiblue (Interchim), after 4, 5 and 6 h of infection. Simultaneously, uninfected cells were treated with compounds and toxicity towards eukaryotic cells was determined using the same assay. The cells were also studied by microscopy after 6 h to assess cell morphology. The results showed a clear dose-dependent rescue effect of (-)-hopeaphenol (1), with complete inhibition of cytotoxicity at 50 \u00b5M, which is in agreement with previous results8 (Fig. 5). Additionally, dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin (10) and resveratrol-pinceatannol hybrid (12) showed a significant dose-dependent rescue effect on eukaryotic cells, while viniferifuran (8), (\u00b1)-\u03b5-viniferin (5) and anigopreissin A (11) showed modest or no efficacy (Fig. 5). Viniferifuran (8) and dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin (10) showed substantial toxicity towards eukaryotic cells at 100 \u00b5M, while some toxicity could be seen for the resveratrol-pinceatannol hybrid (12, Figure S2). Toxicity towards eukaryotic cells limits the possibility to study and accurately assess virulence blocking properties of these compounds.",

            "text": "Most antibiotics in clinical use today are either natural products of microbial origin or improved derivatives obtained by synthesis. Development of new antibiotics based on new synthetic scaffolds have proved to be challenging and this holds true also for identification of chemical entities that block virulence systems by mechanisms distinct from conventional antibiotics e.g. attenuation of T3SS in Gram-negative pathogens. A substantial number of synthetic T3SS inhibitors have been identified by predominantly phenotypic screening, and a selection of compounds have entered medicinal chemistry programs as summarized in recent review articles18,19. Several studies indicate that natural sources also have the potential to provide T3SS inhibitors for further exploration. Screening of marine invertebrate extracts led to the identification of the glycolipid caminoside A as an inhibitor of T3SS in enteropathogenic Eschericia coli (EPEC)20 and later caminocide B-D were also found to be T3SS inhibitors21. In addition to activity against T3SS in EPEC, the caminosides also display antimicrobial activity against vancomycin resistant Enterococcus and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that these compounds act as general antibiotics rather than selective T3SS inhibitors20,21. In another study guadinimine A-F, isolated from a soil-derived Streptomyces broth, were found to block T3SS dependent hemolysis of erythrocytes by EPEC22,23. Aurodox is a known actinomycete derived antibiotic that inhibits protein biosynthesis by binding to bacterial elongation factor Tu22,23. Recently it was reported that aurodox inhibited EPEC T3SS-mediated hemolysis and protected mice infected with a lethal dose of Citrobacter rodentium24. The mechanism for its T3SS inhibition has however not been established. Pseudoceramines A-D and spermatinamine produced by the marine sponge Pseudoceratina spp. were identified as putative inhibitors of T3SS in Y. pseudotuberculosis, but the compounds also exhibited a detrimental effect on bacterial growth, indicating general antibacterial properties25. Phenolic compounds involved in plant defense signaling have been reported to block the T3SS in P. aeruginosa via the GacS-GacA two-component signal transduction system26. Cytosporone B, a fungal metabolite, and analogues selectively block the secretion of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-associated effector proteins, without significant toxicity against bacteria27 and similar effects have been reported for prenylated plant flavonoids, of which licoflavonol proved to be the most promising compound28. It was recently reported that the T3SS of Y. pseudotuberculosis is effectively blocked by piericidin A1, a metabolite produced by a marine actinobacterium29. The compound was identified by screening of a library composed of marine-derived extracts and its virulence blocking activity is not attributed to general toxicity towards the bacteria.",

We identified the resveratrol dimer viniferifuran (8) and analogues as inhibitors of T3SS that target both Y. pseudotuberculosis and P. aeruginosa. Since we could observe inhibition of T3SS-toxins in both Y. pseudotuberculosis and P. aeruginosa it is not likely that the resveratrol dimers act on the toxins per se, since they are different between the bacterial species. The compounds rather act on a homologous function of the T3SS as the needle like structure or tip-proteins on the bacterial surface or some common regulatory system. Viniferifuran was found to irreversibly block the T3SS, indicating that (-)-hopeaphenol and viniferifuran might act by the same mechanism, although the chemical structures are substantially different.
