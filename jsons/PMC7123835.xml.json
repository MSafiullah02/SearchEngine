When 10-day-old chick chorioallontoic membranes from chick embryos were infected with heat or UV inactivated influenza virus, a material was produced that interfered with subsequent viral replication. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Fig. 7.1. Influenza virus production (or inhibition) was measured by hemagglutination, the ability of the virus to interact and agglutinate red blood cells. They termed the interfering substance \u201cinterferon\u201d.The end point of the titration was the identification of that well (on a plate of small wells) with partial agglutination; the reciprocal of the influenza dilution thus observed was taken as the interferon titer (concentration).\n\n",

The stability at pH 2 was an important characteristic, later used to distinguish the original interferon (called IFN-alpha) from other later discovered interferons.

As a result, three pharmaceutical companies, Glaxo Laboratories, ICI Pharmaceuticals, and Burroughs Wellcome (later to become the Wellcome Foundation) supported the research. The primary purpose was to produce enough interferon for use in clinical trials, and a second was to keep the patent for interferon production in the U.K., since there was the feeling that penicillin, a British discovery, had been appropriated by the U.S. (See Burke [5] for a review of the early days of interferon research.)\n",

They injected ultra-violet irradiated vaccinia (inactivated virus) into the backs of rabbits and subsequently inoculated them with live vaccinia at various times after the initial inoculation. The vaccinia replication was inhibited by the pre-treatment with the inactivated virus. They isolated this substance and called it \u201cinhibitory factor\u201d (IF). Further experimentation was difficult because of the system used. These observations were presented at the 1956 Annual Meeting of the Japan Society for Viral Research and later at the meeting of the Japan-France Biology Society held in 1957. This was really the first report on interferon but was not recognized as such until much later. The IF was later tested for interferon activity using rabbit standard interferon, designated as such by the International Committee on Interferons, and it was found to have an interferon titer of 300,000 IU, an astonishingly high level of activity. It is now clear that Yasuichi Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima observed the production of interferon in response to an inactivated DNA virus in the whole animal. Because this work was carried out in Japan, and originally published in a French journal, it was not given the recognition it deserved. (A fuller description of this study can be found in the review by Ozato and colleagues [7].)\n",

Its purpose was to examine whether interferon inhibited the production of vaccinia virus following injection of the virus into the arms of individuals who had not been previously vaccinated with vaccinia. The result was limited inhibition of vaccinia replication; it was also obvious that much more interferon was needed if it was to be of clinical value, but it was not until the 1980s that enough interferon could be produced in a pure state for this purpose. Prior to gene cloning, it was extremely difficult to produce enough interferon for clinical use, even when attempting to produce it in cells in culture. In the 1960s there was a large demand for interferon in order to test it as an anti-cancer drug. Kari Cantell in Finland produced leukocyte interferon, in large vats, in quantities sufficient for some limited clinical trials. He harvested leukocytes from many sources and infected them with the Sendai virus, which greatly stimulated the production of interferon. However, even with these facilities, it was impossible to produce quantities sufficient for all the desired clinical trials (Fig. 7.2).",

Interferon was measured by its anti-viral activity, one unit of interferon being sufficient to inhibit viral growth by 50 %, usually measured by a plaque assay. Since there was some variability depending on the cell line and virus used, standard lots were titered or measured the NIH and supplied as \u201cstandards\u201d to laboratories on request. When interferon was added directly to virus, there was no effect; it was the addition of interferon to the cells that inhibited virus production. A virus-infected cell produces interferon, which protects nearby cells; thus. the nearby cells are in an anti-viral state. (This is illustrated in Fig. 7.3).\n\n",

Differences were found on the basis of cell types protected, and the stability of the interferons at different pH (Table 7.1).

Double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from random mRNA from interferon-producing leukocytes (stimulated with Sendai virus) and cloned into an E. coli plasmid, known as pBR 322. Five thousand bacterial clones were screened by extracting plasmid DNA; they were expressed in frog oocytes, and those synthesizing biologically active interferon isolated. mRNA coding for a polypeptide with IFN activity was isolated, and the IFN was shown to have normal antiviral activity [13]. This research was done in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann at the University of Zurich, and supported by a new biotech company, Biogen. Fifteen percent of the shares of Biogen were held by Schering-Plough, which eventually sold the interferon as Intron A in the U.S. market. This major breakthrough in the cloning of IFN-\u03b12a led to the cloning of other interferons. Meanwhile, other biotech and pharmaceutical companies entered into this very competitive market. The Wellcome Research Laboratories, one of the initial companies involved in interferon research in the U.K., extracted interferon from virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells, and Searle Laboratories, also in England, produced interferon from fibroblasts. Biogen went on to sell interferon-beta 1a (Avonex) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and eventually joined up with a company specializing in monoclonal antibodies, Idec, to form one of the largest biotech companies in the world. Interpharm in Israel began the manufacture and production of IFN-beta in Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture, and finally interferon gamma was cloned in 1981 at the Genentech Company in San Francisco. Thus interferon could now be produced in E.\ncoli, yeast, and mammalian cells [14, 15]. Interferon cloning led to the development of the biotech industry, and for this alone it is historically significant.",

There appear to be many types of IFN-alpha based on gene homology, [16] but only one type of IFN-beta. Since the genes for all class 1 interferons reside on the same chromosome, it is assumed that they arose as duplications of a single interferon gene. Using high performance (or pressure) liquid chromatography (HPLC), it became possible to purify the various interferons and assay them with a biological assay. Using fluorescent tags, the amino acid content and sequence of each type of interferon was determined. There are as many as 24 different interferons that are classified as IFN-\u03b1. Each one has a slightly different amino acid sequence, different specific activity and antiviral spectrum [16]. Different cell types make different amounts of each type; different genes codes for each one. Very little is known of the biological bases of the multiple species and their activities, since most research has only been done with one of these, termed IFN\u03b12. This may not be the most active of the alpha interferons; all the alpha interferons bind to the same receptor, and when one looks at gene (protein) induction as measured by a few key induced proteins, the same level of induction occurs in all cases, suggesting that a minimal amount of interferon triggers activity [16]. Interferon-alpha is induced in various types of leukocytes.\n",

A number of such molecules were produced, one of which had very high specific activity. This molecule had higher specific activity in anti-viral activity, and anti-tumor activity, as measured by the death of hairy cell leukemia cells, and the activation of natural killer cells [17, 18]. Eventually, consensus interferon was approved for the treatment of hepatitis C. A well-planned clinical trial was never performed to examine whether consensus interferon was superior for the treatment of hepatitis C than IFN-\u03b12a (intron A) or IFN-\u03b12b (Pegasys). However, in clinical trials of HCV patients who were not responsive to IFN-\u03b12a or IFN-\u03b12b, there was a 30\u201350 % response rate.",

Interferon-gamma is also induced by cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, and by many growth factors. It is also induced during viral infections in vivo as a part of the immune system. IFN-gamma stimulates the expression of class I and class II MHC molecules and promotes the differentiation of na\u00efve helper T-cells into Th1 cells, activates dendritic and cytotoxic T-cells, and increases the cytotoxicity of NK cells. Thus it is a key player in the immune response. (For an excellent short summary of IFN-gamma activities, see http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/immunology/students/spring2006/v_alvarez/ifn-gamma.html). IFN-gamma is an important component of cellular immunity and plays a significant role in cell differentiation, cell growth, and cell survival.

The spectrum of genes induced by IFN-gamma overlap, but with some differences from the genes induced by interferon alpha and beta [19]. One of the most studied genes induced leads to the production of a protein, IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase). This enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tryptophan (an essential amino acid in humans) catabolism. In culture, cells die in the presence of interferon gamma, unless supplemented with tryptophan [20, 21]. It has been suggested that this enzyme is responsible for T-cell tolerance [22], is induced during pregnancy, and is important in the maintenance of pregnancy in humans [23]. However, this latter hypothesis is controversial [24, 25]. IDO may also have detrimental effects, being higher during septic shock and in certain types of cancers. Thus, the function of this enzyme, and many other proteins induced by the interferons, are still unknown.\n\n",

Following treatment of cells with interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma, hundreds of genes are induced, yielding overlapping spectra for each type of interferon [28\u201330]. Many genes are also suppressed or \u201cdown-regulated\u201d and most of the changes in gene expression are transient in vivo in humans. Many of these genes are well recognized as markers of interferon activity, but their function in regulating the response to virus is difficult to discern. It is becoming obvious that interferons are in fact part of a family of cytokines that are produced by one cell, diffuse to and act on nearby cells, and so drive the machinery of the immune response. Interferons induce many cytokines, which in turn induce many other genes producing a complex cascade of interactions. Cytokine biology is an area of biochemistry too complex to discuss here, but it must be emphasized that it has become an important component of immunology.\n",

IFN alphas and betas both bind to the same receptors, IFNAR1, IFNAR2, and IFN-gamma bind to separate receptors, IFGNR1 and IFNGR2, and IFN-lambda to a third set of receptors which are shared with interleukins IL10, IL28A, IL28B, and IL29 [31] (see Fig. 7.4). Interestingly, virus infection also induces these interleukins. Binding of the interferons activates a number of kinases, including a series of proteins termed JAK kinases (Janus Kinase) which phosphorylate tyrosine on a group of proteins known as STATS (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription). The phosphorylation activates and leads to dimerization of these STAT proteins. There are seven STAT proteins that have been recognized, each related to a different function in either the immune response or metabolic response. The function of these STAT proteins has been elucidated from \u201cknock-out\u201d mice, i.e., mice with specific genes (in this case STATs), deleted. STAT1 is involved with the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway, STAT 2 also with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway, STATs 3, 4, 5A and 5B, and 6 with other interleukins (cytokines). These STAT proteins in turn form complexes with other proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences. In type I interferon signaling, STAT1\u2013STAT2 heterodimers combine with IRF9 (Interferon Response Factor 9, another family of transcription factors) to form ISGF3 (Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor), which in turn binds to the ISRE (Interferon Stimulated Response Element) promoter to induce what are termed interferon-stimulated genes. STAT1 dimers bind to another sequence known as a GAS sequence and interact with IRF1 to stimulate type II interferon genes (this is illustrated in Fig. 7.4).\n",

After being taken up by endosomes or entering the cell through the cell membrane, viral components or viral dsRNA, which can only appear after initial viral replication, activate toll-like receptors or the analogous RIGI system. This is done through \u201cpathogen associated recognition patterns,\u201d which interact with toll-like receptors. This interaction leads to kinase production, enzymes that phosphorylate proteins in a complex reaction that in turn activate genes for interferon production through complexes at specific sites on the promoters of the interferon genes, by a family of molecules known as interferon response factors (IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-7). A similar family of proteins stops the induction and silences the interferon genes (Fig. 7.6). These proteins may function sequentially. Interferon can modulate immune responses by its effects on Class I and Class II MHC molecules (see 10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_6). IFN-alpha, IFN-beta and IFN-gamma increase expression of Class I molecules on all cells, thereby promoting recognition by cytotoxic T-cells that can destroy virus-infected cells. IFN-gamma can also increase expression of Class II MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells, resulting in better presentation of viral antigens to CD4+ T helper cells. Furthermore, IFN-gamma can activate NK cells and dendritic cells, which can kill virus-infected cells. As stated above, interferon induces many genes that are involved in gene regulation, cell differentiation, other cytokine induction and anti-viral activity. As discussed below, many viruses block interferon activity, as shown in Fig. 7.7.\n",

At the biochemical level, these include STAT protein degradation, inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT proteins, and IRF-3 inhibition. Both hepatitis B virus and HIV have been reported to block IFN-synthesis and signaling. The mechanism involved for all viruses in cell culture are described in [33]. During hepatitis C infection, there is robust interferon-stimulated gene transcription, [30, 34, 35] yet HCV persists to replicate to high numbers in chronically infected patients, unless treated with very large amounts of interferon and ribavirin. Under these conditions, some 70 % of patients will still produce virus. One report indicates that HCV does activate the enzyme protein kinase R (PKR), which normally would inhibit host protein synthesis by phosphorylating an initiating factor eIF2a inhibiting host protein synthesis, it appears to inhibit interferon stimulated gene production, thus dampening the interferon effect [36]. Using a cell culture system and an artificial viral construct (replicon, rather than complete virus), interferon activity was inhibited by viral proteins NS5A, E2 and by the IRES element of HCV [37]. This emphasizes the need to work with systems as close as possible to the \u201cnatural\u201d infectious process, since in man none of these mechanisms may be functioning. Viruses such as hepatitis B, polio, SARS, adenovirus, and even HIV have been reported to inhibit interferon activity in cell culture, yet many of them are sensitive to interferon in man.\n",

However, 35 % of the patients in the treatment group withdrew from the study because of the severity of the side effects. Other clinical trials have not been so successful. Attempts to treat children with Japanese encephalitis with IFN-alpha were unsuccessful, even though this virus and other flaviviruses are sensitive to interferon in cell culture [40]. During the SARS epidemic of 2002\u20132003, interferon was used among many other treatments, but the data are inconclusive [41]. Overall, the effect of interferon on virus infections in the clinical setting has been disappointing. Although interferon is active in inhibiting many viruses in cell culture, it does not carry over to the clinic, and there are many reasons for this. Most viruses induce interferon at an early stage of infection, so that the effect of interferon on the virus is established during the course of the infection, and additional amounts may not make much of a difference.",

The experience with Japanese encephalitis and HIV indicate that once a viral infection has been established, it is difficult to eradicate the virus with interferon. Even in cells in culture, the timing of the addition of the interferon is crucial in inhibiting the virus. Long-term exposure to interferon\u2014as in the clinical treatment of hepatitis C\u2014may cause a decrease in white blood cells (leukopenia), leaving the patient susceptible to infections.

However, there was objective evidence of antitumor activity in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), Hodgkin\u2019s disease, breast cancer, and melanoma [43]. One of the first clinical uses of interferon (IFN) was in the treatment of a rare leukemia known as hairy cell leukemia, which results from over-production of mature (and abnormal) B-cells. The cells under the microscope have a hairy morphology, hence the name. These cells in culture are very sensitive to interferon [44]. There are approximately 500 new cases of hairy cell leukemia each year in the U.S. Interferon (alpha, or beta, which was discovered later) is the therapeutic of choice, and about 80\u201390 % of patients will respond to treatment with remission for a period. Interferon therapy did extend the life span in early-stage melanoma and early-stage CML; however, in clinical trials it is inefficient against solid tumors. In Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, as occurs in AIDS patients, it was effective if injected directly into the lesion, but not systemically. A major problem is the large dose of interferon required in any treatment as well as the severe side effects.\n",

A report in 1974 claiming that interferon produced by Cantell could be used to treat cancer motivated a meeting in New York, organized by Mathilde Krim to stimulate interest in interferon and its anti-cancer activities. Dr. Krim was an activist in medical research, and was a faculty member of the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. She was a well-known \u201csocialite\u201din New York and her party for President Kennedy\u2019s 45th birthday was quite famous. She later became an AIDS activist, recognizing early on the problems and ethical dilemmas of the disease. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathilde_Krim). Bill Stewart, one of the early pioneers of interferon research, founded the Interferon Society in 1982. The first formal meeting and the publication of the J. Interferon Research occurred in 1983. The society met once a year with the presentation of papers on the three major classes of interferons (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3).
