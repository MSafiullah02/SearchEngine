A combination of factors leads to the perpetuation of this situation, including the tropical climate, the simultaneous presentation of multiple diseases, innate or acquired host factors (micronutrient deficiency, immunodeficiency, co-morbidities), lack of resources (low income) to procure medicines and vaccines or other preventive tools, lack/misuse (due to lack of training or information) of (suitable) diagnostic tools, increase of pathogen resistance to antimicrobial medicines, as well as social and community factors. As a result, in 2010, 64% of deaths worldwide were still due to infectious diseases; pneumonia, malaria, and sepsis were the leading causes of death, particularly in Africa [1]. Moreover, while the borders between tropical diseases \u2013 thought to be confined around the equator (such as Ebola) \u2013 and infectious diseases classically related to Northern countries (such as influenza) were discrete, climate change and the increase in population migration contributed to a blurring of these borders, thus making the spread of febrile illnesses a global reality and concern.",

            "text": "Many people with acute infectious diseases develop fever, which is a frequent complaint, observed in approximately 80% of pediatric and adult patients presenting with an acute medical condition to health facilities. The estimated incidence of febrile episodes in malaria endemic countries varies according to studies but is generally between 2 and 7 episodes per person per year in children <5 years [2]. Despite the fact that all these infectious diseases cause fever, they can result from very different types of pathogens \u2013 parasites, viruses, bacteria \u2013 each of which requires a different type of treatment and management. Malaria, which was a major cause of fever a few decades ago, has now dropped in many places thanks to the large deployment of preventive and curative measures. A high proportion of patients still suffer, however, from non-malaria febrile illnesses, for which there is almost no diagnostic capability in Africa. Bacterial diseases, such as typhoid fever, often exhibit the same symptoms as malaria, which explains why, in the absence of reliable diagnostic tests, patients are administered an antimalarial instead of an antibiotic medicine. This is a major and sometimes lethal mismanagement. Moreover, enteric fevers (and salmonellosis in general) often act as co-infections to malaria [3] and require, therefore, identification even in the presence of a positive malaria test. Failure to identify the nature of the causative pathogen results in: (i) increased morbidity and mortality due to diseases being untreated or treated with inappropriate antimicrobials [4,5]; (ii) waste of medicines, which may be life-saving for other patients; and (iii) increased resistance to antimicrobials, which is a major public health threat worldwide. This failure has mainly three origins: (i) diagnostic tools to identify the causative pathogen(s) have not been developed, are not accurate enough, or are not available; (ii) the test results are mis-interpreted either due to limited training of healthcare providers, or lack of clear guidelines; (iii) the lack of accurate and simple tools able to measure critical host parameters that can differentiate between colonization/carriage and infection/disease, as well as to determine the degree of severity of the disease.",

If diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and no (accurate) diagnostic tools are available, the epidemic pathogen is first left unrecognized for a long period of time and spreads rapidly and widely. Once detected, the notification of the epidemic disturbs completely the diagnostic workup and patients are all considered as suffering from the emerging pathogen whereas they, in fact, may suffer from a common endemic infection. Two recent examples illustrate this reality: (i) at the peak of an unexpected large dengue epidemic in 2014 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 80% of patients with febrile illness were actually suffering from dengue [6] that was misdiagnosed as malaria by routine health workers, who had no access to dengue diagnostic tools; (ii) during the Ebola outbreak of 2014, 90% of the presumptive patients were, in fact, negative for Ebola, and most patients did not receive treatment for the actual cause of their fever [7].",

            "text": "The first step to improve the management of patients with febrile illness is to estimate the distribution of the various syndromes and pathogens that cause fever. Even though the distribution of fever-causing diseases varies by geography, season, age and immunity of patients and the level of care, some findings were similar among studies [2]. These were related to cosmopolitan diseases found in most places worldwide, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection. For other diseases, with various levels of endemicity, such as typhoid or rickettsiosis, or that occur rather in an epidemic way, such as arbovirus infections, the prevalence varied significantly according to the geographic location and, even more, according to the season or the calendar year. In studies that have recorded the clinical presentation of patients (and not only their laboratory results), the causes of fever in outpatients could be classified into four main syndromes: 1) acute respiratory infections (ARI, of any type); 2) diarrhea (gastroenteritis); 3) fever with another clear focus (e.g. meningitis or skin infection); and 4) non-specific fevers [13] (each diagnostic platform described in Section 5 focuses on at least one of the aforementioned cases). Even though important diagnostic challenges remain regarding the first three syndromes, clear clinical guidelines have been developed by WHO, such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness \u2013 IMCI [14], to help clinicians to assess their patients and to decide on their treatment. Because they correspond to localized infections, these syndromes are generally diagnosed using the best available clinical predictors, while diagnostic tools are indeed not included. In contrast, regarding the 4th syndrome (non-specific fevers), very few guidelines are available.",

According to the 2016 World Malaria Report, 91 countries were still malaria endemic [19]. There were an estimated 212 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2016 and an estimated 429,000 deaths, while 90% of all malaria deaths occurred in Africa. Malaria prevalence varies widely, from 0 to 32% of all fevers. Indeed, the decrease in malaria transmission in many places in Africa [20,21] has led to significant heterogeneity in transmission. The prevalence of malaria among patients with febrile illness has, therefore, become unpredictable and has triggered the switch of the WHO malaria case management policy from presumptive treatment, to treatment based on laboratory confirmation [8].(ii)Urinary tract infection was an important cause of fever in young children (generally younger than two years old) that cannot be suspected on the basis of a history of urinary symptoms at that age (and therefore, it is included in the category of non-specific fevers). The prevalence among all children under five with febrile illness was 1\u20136%.(iii)Enteric fever was a significant cause of fever in children older than two years old and in adults, accounting for 2\u201310% of all fevers, with Salmonella typhi being the most frequent pathogen identified, followed by Salmonella non-typhi.(iv)Other bloodstream infections, mainly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, accounted for about 2% of all fevers. Other systemic bacterial diseases, such as leptospirosis (0.2\u201313%), rickettsiosis (1\u201325%), Q fever (1\u20138%), and brucellosis (5%) were also important causes of fever, especially in adults who were more exposed to zoonoses and other environmental-related diseases than children.(v)Dengue was also an important cause and seemed to emerge in several African countries. Its prevalence is extremely variable, not so much geographically but temporally (seasonal and year to year variation).(vi)Cosmopolitan viruses, such as Human herpesvirus 6, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, and Cytomegalovirus, which are transmitted mainly through close contact within family members, were mostly prevalent in children, accounting for 9% of all fevers and 22% of non-specific fevers in children [13], while adults were more susceptible to vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya or West Nile virus. Acute HIV was found in a few patients.(vii)Co-infection with two or even more pathogens was frequent (in one study, 23% of pediatric patients had more than one disease simultaneously, Fig. 2\n), especially when an outbreak overlapped with an endemic situation, as it happened in a fever study in Tanzania in 2013. Suddenly, in January 2014, a significant outbreak of dengue started, and at the peak of the epidemic, almost 80% of patients presenting with fever were infected with dengue virus of serotype 2 [6]. Because of the absence of diagnostic tools outside the study sites, most of these patients were considered as malaria cases and treated with antimalarial medicines or, in case that malaria tests where available, they were considered as possibly infected by bacteria and treated with antibiotics.(viii)Regarding HIV, chronic HIV is an important co-morbidity, especially for adults (40% were positive in two Tanzanian studies, while HIV prevalence in the corresponding community was 5 to 10%), and should, thus, be systematically screened for, which is unfortunately not the case presently in Africa.\n",

Objective point-of-care (POC) biosensors (such as oximeters), in addition to the subjective assessment of clinical danger signs (such as lethargy or severe dehydration), are helpful to correctly triage patients and should be integrated in the evaluation process [23]. When patients present with a mild disease, ambulatory management with appropriate home-based treatment is sufficient [24,25]. The main challenge is then to identify the few patients who will benefit from antimicrobial treatment among all those with self-limited infection. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials should be avoided as most of these infections are of viral origin (Fig. 2), especially in children (except for malaria that can be ruled out by a rapid diagnostic test). Follow-up of patients to detect persistent or new symptoms and signs will then allow for the detection of rare clinical failures. At the primary care level, the decision to administer an antimicrobial should be based on an initial classification of the condition in the four categories mentioned in Section 2.2, combined with an accurate test specific for each syndrome that can distinguish between bacterial and viral etiology. As the existing host biomarkers lack accuracy (for example, C-reactive protein to identify the few bacterial pneumonia cases among the many viral respiratory infections), they should be combined with clinical predictors (e.g. fast breathing [26]) to improve the overall specificity [23].",

In sepsis, the symptoms and signs are indeed often unspecific to allow for initial classification into the four syndromes mentioned in Section 2.2 and all possibilities should be considered [15]. Under these conditions, accurate laboratory diagnosis is important, and the infections listed in Section 2.2 (taking into account specific exposures mentioned by the patients and the local epidemiology) should be tested for, whenever possible. The results of the laboratory tests should then still be interpreted in the clinical context, i.e. the pre-test probability of the disease and the likelihood ratios of clinical predictors. Indeed, for laboratory tests that have imperfect accuracy, these elements should be considered to calculate the post-test probability and be able to safely include or exclude certain diseases [27]. If this probability is above the \u201ctreatment threshold\u201d (above which one treats the patients instead of continuing investigating them using tests), the appropriate antimicrobial should be administered [28]. If the probability is below the diagnostic threshold, no specific treatment is required, besides adjunctive treatment (e.g. intravenous rehydration in patients with severe diarrhea) and treatment for chronic conditions. If the probability falls between these two thresholds, further testing (when available) may be required and a second-line test should then be used. In practice, antimicrobials are often administered presumptively while waiting for the test results (except for malaria that can be excluded in <15 min based on the results of a rapid test). In summary, evidence-based integrated management of fever is a complex process, both at hospital and primary care levels, that would clearly benefit from electronic clinical decision algorithms (eCDA) based on mobile technology [23,29,30] to guide clinicians through the necessary steps, reach an accurate evaluation of the disease probability, and decide on the most appropriate treatment and management. Electronic clinical decision algorithms are e-Health tools pertaining to the broader category of \u201ccomputerized decision support systems\u201d (CDSS). Contrary to differential diagnosis generators (DDx) that provide a long list of possible diagnoses and have shown poor accuracy [31], eCDA provide structured decision pathways that align with the clinician's workflow and guide the clinician throughout the consultation, including on final treatments and advice (Section 6).",

These patients are very diverse in their immune status, the chronic conditions they may suffer from, and their ability and willingness to pay for a diagnostic test.(ii)People traveling from endemic to non-endemic areas. Although it is difficult to determine the number of returning travelers and migrants to Northern countries that are infected with an endemic disease, because of variation in reporting methods for different pathogens, an estimated 20,000\u201330,000 cases of travelers with malaria are, for example, reported in Europe each year [32]. The number of people crossing borders between the Southern countries is much higher and represents also an important target group. They can be tested at airports, harbors, cross-border controls, immigration control checkpoints, where reliability and short time-to-result tests are required.(iii)Pre- and post-vaccination, elimination, and screening programs run by local governments, international organizations, and pharmaceutical industries. Disease prevention and elimination programs should be supported by comprehensive evidence to demonstrate the underlying prevalence of the pathogen in question and the efficacy of the strategy proposed. Using a multiplexing-capable diagnostic platform allows for effective modeling of the: (a) true prevalence and variation of multiple species, enabling the monitoring of impact of the intervention on disease dynamics; (b) local and regional differences in pathogen distribution.(iv)Epidemics surveillance, particularly of interest in: (a) sentinel sites, where the diagnostic tools can be installed at strategic geographic locations, in order to cover several regional, cultural, environmental, and epidemiological settings; (b) Ministries of Health and regional alarm centers that should regularly receive reports from the sentinel sites for assessment of the frequency of patients and the diversity of diseases.\n",

To this scope, the \u201cASSURED\u201d criteria were developed [35] to summarize the characteristics of the ideal diagnostic test for the developing world, which should be Affordable by the target groups; Sensitive and Specific; User-friendly by limited trained personnel; Rapid and Robust; Equipment-free; and Delivered to those in need. These criteria were initially developed for sexually transmitted infections but are generic for developing countries-targeted diagnostics. However, it has been evident that the users' requirements call for elaboration (or \u201cfine-tuning\u201d) of these criteria. For example, the \u201cequipment-free\u201d criterion may be risky, because saving the test results in the device decreases the risk of mis-interpretation by inexperienced personnel. Therefore, there is an increasing trend to use mobile technology to read results provided by Lateral Flow Tests (LFTs). Moreover, there is need for guidance on how to select patients who should be tested, interpret test results in the clinical context, and triage patients who should be referred and admitted due to severe illness. In case of epidemics, where several patients arrive simultaneously at the checkpoint, the capacity of the tool to process several samples at the same time is an advantage. The ASSURED criteria, together with additional specific requirements, are summarized in Target Product Profiles (TPPs), which technology developers should meet during their development stages. Examples of TPPs exist for tuberculosis, Ebola, and differentiation between viral and bacterial infections, and are driven by the WHO, the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), and other organizations [36,37].",

Poor slide/blood film preparation may lead to artifacts which are mistaken for parasites, while in reality they are bacteria, fungi, dirt, or cell debris. As a consequence, poor specificity leads to poor diagnostic quality [39]. Two studies in Tanzania have shown that the low quality of malaria microscopy and the lack of trust by clinicians in microscopy outcomes resulted in higher mortality among patients with non-malaria febrile illnesses than patients with malaria [40,41].",

Detection of pneumococcal bacteremia can orient the diagnosis; however, this test results in low yields, due to the relative fragility of these bacteria. Indeed, the main general drawback of blood culture is the inability, except for a few cases, to diagnose localized infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection. For typhoid, in addition to blood culture, stool culture and/or bone marrow culture are used but are rarely available. Other limitations are that cultures take several days to provide results and that collection of high quality samples from pediatric patients is rather difficult and often leads to false results [42,43]. In adults, sensitivity of blood culture is limited by the low bacterial load. Specificity of blood culture is also hampered by contamination by cutaneous bacteria during blood withdrawal, because sample acquisition from two different sites to overcome this problem is rather challenging in practice, especially in children.",

Due to the fact that it targets RNA, NASBA was first used for the rapid diagnosis and quantification of HIV-1 [60]. NASBA reaction is facilitated by three enzymes (avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and T7 RNA polymerase) leading to the amplification product. In brief, during the amplification process, cDNA is initially produced from RNA templates through primer (primer 1) annealing to the template RNA and reverse transcription forming a cDNA from the latter. During cDNA production, RNase H hydrolyzes the RNA template. The resulting cDNA with the promoter sequence is annealed to a second primer (primer 2) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is produced with reverse transcription. Following this step, T7 RNA polymerase transcribes an RNA molecule from the previously generated dsDNA. The above procedure is cyclic and in each round the number of produced RNA is increased. A unique advantage of this method is that it can selectively amplify RNA in the presence of high DNA background, while the process can also start with a DNA template. In this case, the RNase H step in the non-cyclic phase is not necessary. With NASBA, amplification of a nucleic acid sequence to >109 copies can be accomplished in ~90 min.",

Thermal denaturation of dsDNA is not required, as the polymerase itself can denature dsDNA prior to elongation. Due to the reaction temperatures employed (60\u201365 \u00b0C), dsDNA is in a meta-stable condition and the structure may hybridize/dehybridize spontaneously. This enables primers to bind to the template DNA in melted regions. Six primers are used resulting in high specificity. The forward (F3) and backward (B3) primers, together with the forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP), generate an artificial starting structure with single-stranded loop regions in each end. Based on this \u201cdumb-bell\u201d structure, a cauliflower-like structure is generated with the FIP and BIP primers binding at the loop region. Loop primers (LF, LB) may help to decrease the reaction time [62]. This process results in very fast generation of dsDNA products that can be detected either with intercalating dyes or with specific probes [63] in potentially <10 min. In short, LAMP is advantageous due to: (i) high specificity, through the use of a minimum of four primers that define six binding sites on the target; (ii) sensitivity equal to, or higher than PCR; (iii) robustness against inhibiting compounds.",

In a first step, the dsDNA unwinding activity of a helicase is exploited to achieve denaturation [66]. Subsequently, the primers anneal to the single-stranded DNA and then are extended by the DNA polymerase. Each DNA duplex is doubled in one cycle. The produced dsDNA molecules are separated by helicase and the chain reaction is repeated. Similar to RPA, single-strand binding proteins are used to stabilize the denatured ssDNA templates. The simplicity of the method, the uncomplicated cycle reaction, and its high speed (especially for circular HDA (cHDA), speed can reach 100 bp/s) are the major advantages of HDA [67]. HDA has been demonstrated to be efficient with several different types of sample matrices, including urine, stool, blood, and plasma [57].",

            "text": "Despite the advantages of NAATs regarding sensitivity, a drawback is the relatively high cost of the reagents, compared to the cost of LFTs. The main cost driver in NAATs is typically the amplification enzyme (the polymerase). Cost further increases when viral RNA should be amplified and a reverse transcriptase should be incorporated in the reaction mix. In the case of some iNAATs, the assay design can be very complicated; for example, primer design in LAMP or the simultaneous use of three enzymes, as required in NASBA. Costs increase further, when enzymes are not pre-stored in liquid, but in dry format (e.g. lyophilized). Such approaches may be required to help enzyme stability at the challenging environmental conditions of tropical regions. However, enzyme activity loss may be observed in lyophilized compared to liquid reagents. Further problems may arise as NAATs inherently measure both living and dead pathogens (as both can provide template DNA). This may lead to false positive diagnosis, for example during monitoring the progress of a patient over a treatment period. From the infrastructure point of view, specialized laboratory facilities are needed. In this case, well-trained personnel must also be employed to achieve proper assay set-up. In case of multiplexed assays, the risk of human error (e.g. pipetting error) increases, even with experienced personnel. To reach satisfying sensitivity, it is generally still necessary to purify nucleic acids from raw sample materials, such as blood, sputum, or urine. Such purification processes may represent >50% of the manual workload. The labor costs for manual workflows add substantially to the overall costs.",

Despite the complexity of its cartridge (assembly of more than five parts), the system was adopted by resource-limited countries due to the endorsement of the Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF test for TB by the WHO in 2010 and the financial support by the Global Fund for AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The system contains several additional versions to detect drug-resistant TB, HIV, MRSA, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea [76], while it included Ebola testing during the 2014 outbreak. The time-to-result is estimated to be 60 min. The system of the Xpert\u00ae series is developed in single-cartridge or multi-cartridge configurations for the end-users to decide which option is more suitable to their needs: low/medium throughput (1-, 2-, 4-, 16-cartridge system) for the point-of-care, or high throughput (80-cartridge station) for centralized laboratories. The most portable system of the Xpert\u00ae series aims to truly decentralize TB diagnosis. The GeneXpert\u00ae Omni* (Fig. 4(b)) is a single-cartridge version, battery operated and wirelessly connected to the cloud (operable also via smartphone), which allows highly decentralized utility and real-time data transmission. The price of a test is US$40\u201360 in the US market, however there are special arrangements with NGOs that subsidize this test for TB in developing countries, thus eventually costing slightly below US$10 (excluding shipping and distribution; this is the sales price ex works). The GeneXpert\u00ae IV device cost is approximately US$17,000, while the GeneXpert\u00ae Omni* costs less than US$3,000.",

An important component of the cartridge is an integrated filter, which is located at the base of the valve body and captures the microorganisms. Subsequently, a sonic horn approaches the filter area and mediates the mechanical lysis of the microorganisms and the release of nucleic acids. The latter are pumped through a chamber where beads with freeze-dried amplification reagents are stored. These are rehydrated upon sufficient filling of the corresponding chamber (the filling level acts also as internal fluidic quality control).

As in the beginning there are only few amplicons, labeled reporters hybridize with the surface-probes, thus, the initial signal is high. As the PCR reaction progresses, the labeled reporters preferably bind to the amplicons, therefore, less reporters are bound on the microarray. Consequently, the progress of PCR is monitored via the decrease of fluorescence from the microarray spots until a plateau in the amplification reaction is reached.

Although the main application of the system has been on respiratory tract infections [105], its functional and performance characteristics would enable potential use in febrile illness diagnosis. Indicatively, the pipeline of infectious diseases includes influenza A and B, as well as RSV. The Enigma\u00ae ML requires no laptop due to its internal controller and user-friendly touch screen. The instrument is available in a modular configuration, i.e. in a single-module up to a six-module option (for one to six cartridges, respectively). Each module can operate independently via the central controller, therefore, different assays (requiring different protocols) from the same or different specimens can be performed at the same time. The overall analysis time for each module is 95 min. The analytical and diagnostic verification process of the FluAB-RSV assay on the Enigma\u00ae ML that led to the subsequent CE marking was completed in July 2013, at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK [105].",

At the same time it is arranged in such a way that the electrically conducting profile differs in different areas of the vessel (along its axis), thereby controlling thermal gradients that are necessary for thermocycling. The different electrical conducting profile is regulated during the manufacturing of the vessel by varying its radial thickness (key parameter), thus varying unevenly its resistance profile. The vessel consists of a combination of a highly conductive material (aluminum) and an ECP, the two being separated by an insulating layer. The aforementioned induced temperature gradients also assist in convection-based liquid mixing in the reaction vessel. The ECP fabrication technology is typically injection molding.",

The analyzer also provides control of reaction conditions at different temperatures, and alternating movement of the reaction mix between two different temperature zones for rapid PCR (Fig. 12\n).

An alternative approach is to seal the two components with a hot-melt adhesive joint with ethylene vinyl acetate, or with UV cure epoxy.

Their collaboration with the Institute of Microelectronics (IME) of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, is strategic for the fabrication of the key microelectronic components. The Q-POC\u2122 platform (Fig. 15\n) of QuantuMDx is a handheld, battery-powered molecular diagnostic device that promises a sample-to-answer DNA-based result in as few as 15 min. It contains integrated reagents with current stability targets of up to 40 \u00b0C for up to 18 months. The system can test one patient per run and is a pioneering approach to the handheld sequencing market. In 2014, QuantuMDx partnered with FIND in order to develop a solution for the combined detection of TB and drug susceptibility determination for the causative agent of TB. The Q-POC\u2122 system seems to be especially promising for antimicrobial resistance profiling given that many different genes can be screened through a nanowire array. There are several other assays in the pipeline, for diagnosis of e.g. HIV, sexually transmitted infections, neglected diseases, as well as for tumor profiling [124].",

SiNWs have large surface-to-volume ratio, tunable electric properties, and exhibit high potential as biosensors, thus enabling next-generation point-of-care diagnostics. The binding events are detected in a label-free way through changes in the nanowires' resistance, effectively converting the genetic code into a binary code and providing the output in a digitized format. In particular, upon hybridization of the target DNA on the SiNW, the charge density (and subsequently the electric field) changes. This is reflected as a change in the resistance of the nanowire, which produces the biosensing signal (Fig. 16\n). The more negative charges present during hybridization, the higher the resistance of the n-type SiNW sensor. This principle was shown by Zhang et al., by varying the hybridization sites (thus varying the distance of the charge layer) but keeping the total number of charges unchanged [126].",

With dimensions of 13\u201315 nm, the advantage of AuNPs over conventional fluorophores is the increased sensitivity by several orders of magnitude (e.g. the light scattered from one nanoparticle is equivalent to the light emitted from 500,000 fluorophores [143]). After amplification is completed, the workflow for detection is as follows: inside the test cartridge, the amplified targets are hybridized to capture oligonucleotides that are pre-immobilized on the glass slide microarray. After removal of the unbound DNA, the hybridization products are labelled with AuNPs. Subsequently, intermediate oligonucleotides are flushed into the chamber and bind specifically to the immobilized complex, leaving a poly-A tail sticking out and being available for subsequent attachment of poly-T-bound AuNPs, which act as probes. After removal of unbound AuNPs, captured AuNPs are covered by silver NPs (during the analysis procedure) to enhance the scattered light. Thus, the overall size of the NPs becomes larger and the subsequent optical signal is enhanced. Illumination begins with an LED (\u03bbmax 630 nm) shining through the edge of the glass slide (acting as a waveguide to the LED illumination). The evanescent wave that is generated through the glass slide and towards the NP coated surface causes light scattering from the illuminated Au/silverNPs towards the camera, which captures images of the array multiple times and at various exposure times [144]. Notably, the AuNP-based detection technology may be adapted for protein analysis as well.",

Typical foil thicknesses are between 150 and 300 \u03bcm. A mold and a thin polymer foil placed above the mold are heated at a temperature near the glass transition temperature of the polymer foil. When the conditions are favorable, air is blown from the top so that the foil takes the shape of the mold. Main process parameters are the applied air pressure and the temperatures of mold and foil. Various materials can be used, with most preferable candidates being the Cyclic Olefin Polymer/Copolymer (COP, COC) and Polycarbonate (PC), depending on the application requirements. Sealing is performed either via a pressure sensitive adhesive foil (containing nanocapsules, which break and release adhesive upon application of pressure) or via thermal sealing using one more foil material (e.g. COC on COC). The elastomeric molds are suitable for prototyping, where fast iterations are required. However, each elastomeric mold may be worn out after repeated use for some tens of cartridges. Thus, for large manufacturing series it is more efficient to use a metal mold. It may be more challenging to deform the foil (and methods such as coating on metal are used), however it is economically more sustainable and the durability of one metal mold can be sufficient for tens of thousands of disks.",

The GenePOC\u2122 disposable is composed of three distinct operational sectors: (i) World-to-chip interface: 100 to 200 \u03bcL of clinical sample conditioned in GenePOC\u2122 sample buffer is inserted in the disposable with a transfer pipette. The developers mention that the use of blood is not feasible yet, as it would require off-chip microbial pre-concentration. Subsequently, the inlet chamber is sealed with a lid that prevents aerosols from leakage. A series of siphons and passive valves prime the liquid to the next chambers. (ii) Universal sample preparation, starting with pathogen mechanical lysis: a metallic disk is magnetically actuated in the chamber where glass beads are present leading to efficient lysis and release of nucleic acids. The lysate is centrifugally driven to a dilution chamber, where PCR inhibitors are inactivated by heating up to 95 \u00b0C and with proper ionic condition adjustment of the extracted material in order to optimize subsequent amplification. (iii) The amplification and detection sector, which is the only assay-specific area of the cartridge where RT-PCR is performed (reagents are dry-stored). This sector has three chambers available for amplification (thermocycling is achieved via air heating of the overall process chamber). The device includes four non-overlapping excitation and emission wavelengths for fluorescence detection of chemical dyes, therefore, up to 12 targets (4 in each chamber) can be detected simultaneously, and under rotation. Further details regarding cartridge material and fabrication methods are not available by the manufacturer.",

In total, nine pipetting steps are required, which can be reduced by replacing some liquid components with lyophilized reagents. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the system was applied in field trial in Guinea in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, the Public Health Institute of Guinea, the University of Stirling, the Robert Koch Institute, and TwistDx Ltd.

This innovative approach tackled several problems including lack of (constant) electricity; lack of cold chain for material storage; risk and time loss from transferring infectious material from the field to central laboratories for analysis; and the need for fast time-to-result for healthcare providers who screened patients for Ebola virus. A natural drawback of the DiaS system is the lack of connectivity with all the accompanied consequences (manual registration of data, risk of loss, ambiguous storage of data, etc.). Furthermore, it requires a certain degree of user training for the handling of manual steps.",

The feasibility of using robust blood culture bottles with visual readout, with a new type of media that bypasses the need for blood and, thus making it easy to use by non-experts, is being currently evaluated. A simple pathogen identification system, restricted to genus, as well as an antibiotic sensitivity testing system, restricted to the six antibiotics used frequently at the peripheral level, have also been developed. The target patient populations are children presenting with severe illness, those with risk factors for bloodstream infections, such as neonates, malnourished or HIV positive children, those who fail to respond to first-line antibiotic treatment, hospitalized war patients, and patients with trauma or prior surgery by providing organism-directed antibiotic therapy. With the developed autonomous diagnostic laboratory, it will be possible to acquire information regarding more general questions such as proportions and antibiotic resistance profiles of key bacterial pathogens, thereby providing evidence-based information for antibiotic policy (appropriate prescribing) and allowing for the improvement of epidemiological investigations as well as supporting healthcare infection control in emergencies and in neglected populations in resource-limited settings.",

This should be a requirement for all new diagnostic tests, but it is even more important for point-of-care tests that are often used in non-selected patients (for example, any patient with fever attending any level of the health system) and by users with no technical background. Before large-scale implementation in resource-limited countries is decided, the test should also preferably be endorsed by WHO and by international donors and governments that provide funding. Unfortunately, many point-of-care tests have been launched in the market with only limited laboratory validation using convenient patient samples (for example that have a high pathogen load), or even cultured pathogens in relatively high concentration. Field evaluation of the performance of the test in real patients, who often harbor low pathogen loads, is indeed often undertaken only after registration of the product. This is due to the lack of national and international regulatory mechanisms applicable to diagnostic tests, which, in contrast, exist for medicines [189]. The net result is that health workers, especially those working in private clinics, and even patients going to pharmacies, have access to POC tests that have in fact very low sensitivity and/or specificity. For example, LFT for chikungunya is commercialized, although it has a sensitivity of maximum 50% in the field [[190], [191], [192]].",

The sensitivity of NAATs to detect bacteria in the blood compared to blood cultures is often disappointing [33]. Even though NAATs are able to detect additional cases compared to blood-culture, they are not positive in all blood culture-positive patients [193] because bacterial load can be very low, especially in adult patients with robust immunity. This explains the failure of numerous molecular-based multiplex platforms licensed in Northern countries, aiming at diagnosing rapidly the cause of sepsis in admitted patients. These tests work well for blood cultured for a few days but not for native blood, which implies that the potential gain of time, essential in these patients, is lost [194]. Tests based on the detection of antibodies, even of IgM type, often lack sensitivity during the very first days of an acute febrile episode, but also specificity because of antibody persistence for several weeks.",

To follow this adage, it is even more important nowadays that a continually increasing number of diagnostic tools is becoming available at the point of care. That should, however, not be interpreted as it has been for years with malaria microscopy, as an invitation to disregard test results and treat diseases presumptively based on clinical elements with low sensitivity and/or specificity [195]. This adage rather suggests that, because no diagnostic test is 100% perfect, their results do not provide a black-or-white answer, but rather an indication on the disease probability. This probability depends on two factors: (i) the prevalence of the disease in the corresponding patient population (pre-test probability), and (ii) the performance (positive and negative likelihood ratios) of the test used. When a disease is rare in the population (low pre-test probability) even if the test has a reasonable accuracy, the post-test probability after a positive result remains low. For example, if a typhoid rapid test with 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity (and thus, a likelihood ratio (LR) of 0.8/(1\u20130.8) = 4) is used in an area of Asia where prevalence of typhoid fever among patients with febrile illness is 20%, the post-test probability will be 50% (it can be calculated using Fagan's nomogram [196]), which suggests that it is reasonable to implement an antibiotic treatment to that patient. If the same test is used in an area of Africa where the prevalence is 2%, the post-test probability will only be 7.5%, which hardly justifies treating the patient for typhoid but rather to consider alternative diagnoses.",

Mobile electronic technologies are promising tools to overcome these challenges. An electronic algorithm is, indeed, able to guide clinicians through the specific branches that apply to their patients, to accelerate training by teaching health workers directly on the mobile support (and even integrating training modules into the device), and to help to disseminate quickly to all health workers updated versions of e-algorithms through 3G connection. Fig. 30\nprovides a schematic representation of an integrated tool that aims at managing children with febrile disease at primary care level in resource-limited countries (derived from the existing e-POCT tool [23]). The tool integrates a few key clinical data, biosensors measuring respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, cardiac rate, glycemia, and hemoglobinemia, as well as rapid diagnostic tests detecting malaria antigen (other pathogens can be added according to local endemicities) and host biomarkers (to differentiate bacterial from viral infections). It then provides guidance to health workers on when to refer a sick child, and whether to prescribe or not an antimicrobial (and other type of medicines), while it also calculates drug dosage based on weight or age.",

The source of information would be patients seen at routine health facilities tested by POC tools that have a direct impact on case management (e.g. malaria or typhoid), but also from a restricted number of sentinel sites where additional POC test, aimed at detecting pathogens of particular interest (that cause large epidemics, even if non-treatable such as dengue, or rare such as Ebola virus disease), would be used. The data accumulated on a daily or weekly basis (depending on the level of 3G connection availability) at the central level would allow health authorities to conduct real-time disease surveillance, through weekly/monthly reports, and would also enable immediate outbreak alarms when the pre-set incidence threshold for the surveyed disease has been reached. From the central server, automated feedback reports can also be created, sent to clinicians' tablets and discussed during supervision visits at the health facility. Training e-tools, aimed at improving management of patients in general or in the particular situation of an outbreak, could also be sent to the tablet to guide clinicians. Finally, a patient file supported by an electronic card owned by the patient, could be synchronized at each new consultation with the data collected by clinicians in the tablet (Fig. 31\n). Such a fully integrated system seems to be over-optimistic; however, each of its components has already proven to be feasible and the challenge now is to find appropriate and sustainable diagnostic and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platforms that can be deployed at large scale and in the long term.",

Regarding performance, some technologies may be fully automated and multiplexed, but they are prohibitively expensive; some are cost-effective, but compromise sensitivity or multiplexity. In contrast, some solutions offer multiplexity, yet they are benchtop, require laptop, electricity, and are barely portable (due to size and weight). Regarding technology, most of the described platforms implement nucleic acid amplification (PCR- or isothermal-based) and almost none of them includes a parallel immunoassay analysis to measure the host response to an infection. A few of the suggested approaches are equipment-free but therefore lack connectivity and interfacing ability. However, one can observe a common rationale in the structure of the described technologies. The vast majority are based on the combination of three components: the assay, the cartridge, and the readout device. Several variations may exist in the format of the assay, the cartridge, or the detection principle; however, this three-element model seems to be the backbone of all described diagnostic platforms. This modular nature should motivate the developers and manufacturers to consider more (semi)open and adaptable platforms to address end-users' needs in a dynamic way, being able to quickly modify their panels and adapt to endemic or epidemic needs.",

Such algorithms are derived from paper-based guidelines to computerized versions (which enforce the provision of output for any possible combination of clinical elements, which is not the case for traditional guidelines), operating on 3G mobile tools such as tablets. They receive, as input, data from several (POC and non-POC) diagnostic tests, which are processed via clinical algorithms, to provide clinicians with guidance regarding the handling of the patient (admission, treatment, etc.). Such interoperability between ICT components and interfaced physical systems (diagnostic tests) for decision-support can provide solutions of clinical and public health utility, therefore, this trend is expected to increase rapidly, offering high impact diagnosis in developing countries, and transforming the global healthcare landscape. This process, being rather complex and requiring know-how from a variety of disciplines and partners, requires multiple interactions between universities, industries, governmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as philanthropic institutions, that are not only based in wealthy countries but also in resource-limited countries. To increase the chances to make progress, most successful technologies should be supported and developers be motivated to partner with each other. It is only with such a spirit that the development pathway can be coherent and harmonized, and the new tools eventually may be implemented at large scale.",

Regarding label-free technologies, it is important to consider how they can potentially be integrated into sample-to-answer systems, in view of the requirements outlined in 2.3, 2.4.

Ideally, developers should have access to fabrication facilities that could perform the scale-up manufacturing in two phases: first, from prototyping to medium scale manufacturing (a few thousands or tens of thousands cartridges/chips/components per year) in order to serve clinical validation studies; and in a next level to aim for large scale manufacturing (tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, that are fairly realistic quantities for infectious diseases of global impact). Special attention should be given to the heterogeneous integration of components, i.e. when a system consists of not only plastic/silicon/glass core components, but integrates biological and biochemical agents, which are necessary for the sample-to-answer analysis. Issues of stability and compatibility of (bio)chemical reagents with cartridge materials and manufacturing processes, adsorption (and loss) of reagents may prove critical for reaching the desired limit of detection.",

Along these lines, the combination of nucleic acid with protein biomarker testing seems to be a path for more reliable diagnosis, especially in case of syndromes caused by several different pathogens of bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal nature. Further elaborating on the ecosystem approach, and especially for diagnostics for resource-limited countries, special business model developments are required that would render marketization in the target areas attractive. Large industries or Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) may choose their own way to market, but a new path may be to try marketing in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry. It is obvious that diagnostics and therapeutics are the two sides of the same coin, and only through their combination and interplay can healthcare truly progress.

The developers/manufacturers should compare the manufacturing cost of their technology to the real cost of the same test within their healthcare systems. A substitution of an existing standard of care by an innovative technology would be welcome if: it can lead to the same clinical impact at an overall lower price; or it can offer higher clinical impact at the same price.
