            "text": "Rotaviruses (RV) are non-enveloped double-stranded RNA viruses in the Reoviridae family and in the Rotavirus genus, and are classified into eight species (A-H) and two candidate species (I and J) (Matthijnssens et al., 2012, Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2015, B\u00e1nyai et al., 2017). Species A rotavirus (RVA) is a major cause of dehydrating diarrhea in humans and animals worldwide (Estes and Greenberg, 2013). The RVA genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) encoding six structural proteins (VP1\u20134, VP6, and VP7) and five or six nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP5/6) depending on the strain (Estes and Greenberg, 2013). The RVA genomic classification nomenclature is based on all 11 segments of dsRNA (Matthijnssens et al., 2008, Matthijnssens et al., 2011). Currently, there are 35 VP7 (G), 50 VP4 (P), 26 VP6 (I), 21 VP1 (R), 19 VP2 (C), 19 VP3 (M), 30 NSP1 (A), 21 NSP2 (N), 21 NSP3 (T), 27 NSP4 (E), and 21 NSP5/6 (H) genotypes (Rotavirus Classification Workgroup (RCWG), 2016). In this study, we described two new RVA VP4 and VP7 genotypes in strain RVA/Alpaca-wt/PER/Alp11B/2010 from a Peruvian alpaca.",

The animals were subjected to postmortem examinations at the Laboratory of Histology, Embryology and Veterinary Pathology, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Peru. Intestinal lavage samples were obtained during necropsy by thoroughly washing the intestines with warm water, and then these samples were analyzed for E. coli, Clostridium ssp. Eimeria spp., Cryptosporidium spp., coronavirus and RVA. The sample Alp11b was positive only for RVA (Rojas et al., 2016a).

RVA detection was performed by RT-PCR with primers that amplified a small conserved portion of the VP6 gene (Rojas et al., 2016b). Once RVA was detected, the sample was subjected to additional RT-PCR amplifications to identify the VP4, VP7, VP6, NSP4, and NSP5 genotypes using specific primers (Appendix) that were previously published or designed based on RVA sequences available in GenBank.

Sequences of Alp11B strain were aligned and compared to that of each corresponding gene of RVA strains obtained from GenBank, by using MegAlign, which are available in the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Multiple alignments were done by using the complete open reading frame (ORF) for each gene segment. Nucleotide and amino acid identities were determined with the MegAlign p-distance algorithm.
