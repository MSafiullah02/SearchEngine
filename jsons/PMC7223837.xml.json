            "text": "Chandipura virus (CHPV), belonging to family Rhabdoviridae, genus vesiculovirus, was discovered in Chandipura village, Nagpur region of India during an outbreak of febrile illness caused by dengue and chikungunya viruses in 1965 [1]. Since then, it has been responsible for several outbreaks in Andhra Pradesh in 2003 [2, 3], Gujarat in 2004 [4], Nagpur in 2007 [5], and Odisha in 2009 [6]. It is one of the major causes of acute encephalitis in pediatric population in India [2]. Chandipura virus has a negative sense, single-strand RNA genome of size 11 kb. Genome comprises of five proteins. Glycoprotein (G) enables virus absorption, assembly, and budding and, therefore, act as major antigenic determinant., matrix protein (M) responsible for cytotoxicity in infected cells, large protein (L) forms the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby acts as a catalytic subunit, Nucleocapsid protein (N) wraps the viral genome, forms template for virus transcription and phospho protein (P) acts as transcriptional activator [7]. Compared to other encephalitic viruses, CHPV-associated fatality occurs within 24 h of onset of illness [2, 6, 8], leading to infrequent appearance of IgM antibodies to CHPV. Thus, the diagnosis is mainly dependent on the detection of the P gene of CHPV in viral RNA in the human clinical samples by RT-PCR [4]. IgG antibodies against G protein to CHPV are a marker of immunity/recovery from CHPV infection [9].",

It serves to link innate and adaptive immunity through a large number of activities such as recognition of viruses, viral neutralization, recruitment and stimulation of leukocytes at the sites of infection, opsonization, and activation of T and B cells [15\u201318]. Complement activation plays an important role in viral pathogenesis [19] and could also serve to improve the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic vectors [19]. The complement cascade can be initiated through three main pathways (depending upon virus recognition): the classical pathway, lectin pathway, or alternative pathway [20]. The classical pathway is antibody dependent and is activated upon binding of C1q to antigen antibody complex on the surface of pathogen. The lectin pathway gets activated when carbohydrate patterns on pathogen, attached to serine proteases like Mannan-binding serine proteases (MASPs) associated with mannan-binding lectin (MBL) [21], ficolins [22].",

These three pathways converge on a central component C3, which is activated by cleavage into C3a and C3b. C3a serves as a potent anaphylatoxin to promote inflammation. C3b can bind covalently to viral components to aid in opsonization and phagocytosis. The association of C3b with components further downstream, such as C5 through C9, can lead to formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is capable of lysing virus particles or infected cells [16, 24]. Progression of the complement cascade depends on the assembly of C3b with other cleavage products from C4, C2, and factor B to form the C3 convertase [25], a protein complex which functions to amplify the signal by further cleavage of C3 molecules in feedback\nloop. The alternative pathway C3 convertase complex consists of C3b together with a factor B cleavage product to make C3bBb and the classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase consists of C4 and C2 cleavage products to make C4b C2a.",

Here, our data indicated that 9 out of 10 NHS (at 1:4 dilution) showed neutralizing activity against CHPV with reciprocal neutralization titres ranging from 2 to 16 and 7 out of 10 counterparts HIS did not neutralize CHPV at any dilutions (Table 1), suggesting that the observed neutralization could be complement mediated as reported in VSV infection [46]. The observation was further supported by (1) real-time RT-PCR assay showing suppression of CHPV copies by 1 log10 in \u201cNHS + CHPV\u201d group compared to both CHPV only and \u201cHIS + CHPV\u201d groups (Fig. 2a, b). However, factors like antimicrobial peptides present in the serum could be attributed to the observed neutralization of CHPV for HIS1, HIS3 and to some extent for HIS10 (Fig. 2b) compared to their respective virus controls. Besides, in a biological system, all individuals may not behave in a similar manner in response to a pathogen. (2) Flow cytometry-based TC-LDA assay showed decrease of 18.25% and 23.08% in \u201cNHS7/NHS8/NHS9 + CHPV\u201d-positive cells compared to CHPV only and \u201cHIS7/HIS8/HIS9 + CHPV\u201d groups (Fig. 2d), thus establishing the activation of complement system.",

            "text": "The alternative pathway is activated by recognizing the foreign pathogens with factor B, factor D, and properdin to form C3 convertase (C3BbP) which cleaves C3 to form C3b [49]. The binding of factor B to C3b is Mg2+ dependent [50] and results in the cleavage of factor B into Ba and Bb. Bb combine to the hydrolyzed form of C3 to form C3 (H2O) Bb. Therefore, a constant level of C3b remains in human plasma during this process of self-defense and no pathogen recognition molecule participates in this pathway, and this phenomenon is known as \u201ctick-over\u201d [51\u201353]. The role and mechanisms of alternative pathway involvement were further explored using in vitro studies, where factor B-deficient human serum showed reciprocal neutralization titre of 4 that was amplified to 8 upon reconstitution with factor B. Reciprocal neutralization titre of 4 in factor B-deficient human serum could very well be attributed to an amplification loop/\u201ctick-over\u201d mechanism. Through the \u201cTick-over \u201cmechanism, a steady level of C3b remains in human plasma even when pathogen is absent [51\u201353] and this leads to vigorous activation of alternative pathway upon pathogen recognition [54, 55]. Similar disparities have been reported in collagen antibody-induced arthritis involving in vivo and in vitro studies [56].",

C5b initiates the assembly of the MAC by interacting with the downstream molecules on the membrane of the pathogen [57]. C5 can also directly contribute to virus neutralization [44, 58]. Since C8 is also one of the major constituents of the MAC, the effect of C5 and C8 depletion on CHPV neutralization and infectivity was examined. C5-depleted serum failed to exhibit any neutralizing activity against CHPV, but the same was restored when the physiological concentration of C5 was the same as NHS. Parallel evidence of decrease in CHPV infectivity (by real-time PCR) in reconstituted C5 suggested C5 as an essential factor for the in vitro neutralization of CHPV. C8-depleted serum by itself was capable of neutralizing CHPV (4 reciprocal neutralization titer), reconstituting C8 resulted in more effective in vitro neutralization of CHPV (8 reciprocal neutralizing titer) indicating that C8 is not essential for in vitro neutralization of CHPV. However, C8 enhanced neutralization of CHPV at low concentrations of serum (8 reciprocal neutralizing titer).",

Initial studies on VSV have shown that C3b deposition on VSV hinders its attachment to host cell, thereby leading to virus neutralization [63]. Johnson et al. have reported that C3 upon activation by paramyxoviruses, mumps virus and simian virus gets aggravated and deposited on virion which leads to viral lysis [33]. Though C5 is the initiator of MAC formation, it can also directly participate in virus neutralization [44, 58]. In a similar line, C5 involvement but non-involvement of C8 and C9 in the CHPV neutralization of the current study probably denies MAC formation.",
