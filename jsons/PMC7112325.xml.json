Aeroallergen sensitization was defined as positive IgE antibodies to any of the latter 8 allergens. Perennial aeroallergen sensitization was defined as positive IgE antibody results to dog, cat, or D pteronyssinus.

Categorical variables were analyzed by using \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests. The difference between the prednisolone and placebo groups in primary outcomes, new physician-confirmed wheezing episodes within 2 months, and initiation of regular controller medication for asthma symptoms within 12 months was tested with Cox regression. Time to event was defined from baseline to the time of occurrence of the event. Survival times were censored if the event did not occur within 2 months (wheezing episode) or 12 months (asthma symptoms) of follow-up. Poisson regression analysis was used to investigate the difference between the prednisolone and placebo groups in the number of physician-confirmed wheezing episodes within 12 months. The modifying effect of rhinovirus load at study entry on the effect of prednisolone (vs placebo) was tested, including a rhinovirus load\u2013group interaction effect in the Cox and Poisson models. Because of highly positively skewed distribution, rhinovirus load was dichotomized. The cutoff for rhinovirus load was identified by testing for different values and selecting the approximate threshold that yielded the lowest P value for rhinovirus load\u2013group interaction effect. Cox or Poisson regression models did not include any covariates because no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between groups. Proportional hazard assumption in Cox models was checked by using the martingale residual. The 2-sample t test (cough and noisy breathing), Wilcoxon rank sum test with Hodges-Lehmann estimate for median difference (expiratory breathing difficulty, nocturnal symptoms, and bronchodilator at home), and Poisson regression (nocturnal symptoms, outpatient clinic visit, hospitalization, oral corticosteroid, and inhaled corticosteroid) were used to evaluate differences in the secondary outcomes between the groups.

In terms of the number needed to treat, treatment of 2 children with a rhinovirus load of greater than 7000 copies/mL would prevent 1 relapse within 2 months. Rhinovirus load at study entry also modified the effect of prednisolone on the number of physician-confirmed wheezing episodes during the next 12 months (rhinovirus load\u2013group interaction effect, P = .03). Among children with a rhinovirus load of greater than 7000 copies/mL, the number of physician-confirmed new wheezing episodes during the 12-month follow-up was lower in the prednisolone group compared with that seen in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.98; P = .04), but no difference was found between the groups among children with a rhinovirus load of 7000 copies/mL or less (relative risk, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.1; P = .33). Among children with a rhinovirus load of greater than 7000 copies/mL, initiation of regular controlled medication for asthma symptoms within 12 months was nonsignificantly lower in the prednisolone group compared with that seen in the placebo group (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-1.2; P = .13), but no difference was found between the groups among children with a rhinovirus load of 7000 copies/mL or less (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5-3.3; P = .70).

To be more specific, children with a rhinovirus load of greater than 7000 copies/mL benefitted from prednisolone in terms of longer time to a physician-confirmed relapse during the 2- or 12-month follow-up and less physician-confirmed wheezing episodes within 12 months; they also tended to need less regular controlled medication for asthma symptoms within 12 months.

In our previous review14 we found that 7 (44%) of 16 trials showed beneficial effects of systemic corticosteroids on short-term outcomes, whereas 9 (56%) of 16 did not. More recently, researchers have focused on which subgroup might benefit the most or on the role of combined treatments. Alansari et al32 found that dexamethasone effectively decreased the time to readiness for discharge in infants with bronchiolitis and increased risk of asthma (as determined based on eczema or a family history of asthma) by 31%. Also, use of systemic corticosteroids has effectively reduced the occurrence of relapses resulting in a clinic visit during a 2-month follow-up in hospitalized first- or second-time wheezing children aged 3 to 35 months with associated rhinovirus infection or blood eosinophil counts of 0.2 \u00d7 109/L or greater.19 Thus systemic corticosteroids might have a beneficial effect on short-term outcomes when targeted for children at high risk for asthma, as defined by rhinovirus positivity, eczema, family history of asthma, and/or increased blood eosinophil counts. Moreover, systemic corticosteroids, when combined with nebulized epinephrine, were of borderline significance in reducing the need for hospitalization in infants with bronchiolitis, and the effect was not affected by positive RSV status (rhinovirus was not examined), a personal or family history of atopy, presentation early in the course of illness, or severe illness.31 Four studies have not shown an effect in children with atopic characteristics, but they have been underpowered to fully address the atopy issue, or the prednisolone was parent initiated.15, 17, 31, 33\n",

This finding is supported by our previous trial, with 1- and 7-year follow-ups showing long-term effect of prednisolone in rhinovirus-positive children with first-time wheezing.4, 9 During our previous study, conventional PCR followed by liquid hybridization was used in rhinovirus diagnostics. In the current study this method was replaced by real-time PCR, which more efficiently detects rhinoviruses.34 Quantitative PCR was not done in our previous study. The most likely explanation for the effect of prednisolone in the group with high copy numbers is that the high rhinovirus load is associated with more severe airway inflammation.1, 6, 10, 11, 12, 19, 26, 29, 30 Airway inflammation is typically associated with low interferon expression, leading to decreased viral clearance, increased virus replication, and eventually more severe airway inflammation. Epithelial cell cultures with a broken surface are more susceptible to rhinovirus replication than those with an intact surface.27 In agreement, previous studies have shown a positive association between rhinovirus load and illness severity, as did we with cough severity.35, 36\n",

Even 10% absolute differences in relapse rates have recently been considered meaningful in wheezing children.40 The results might not be generalizable to outpatients because 80% of our subjects were enrolled at hospitalization; the sample size was too small to permit meaningful analysis of inpatient versus outpatient interactions. There was a delay in the initiation of study drug in the current trial compared with our previous trial (45 vs 0 hours, respectively) because of completion of rhinovirus PCR. This is why our primary outcome was the time to recurrence and not the short-term (secondary) outcomes. However, we found no association between the delay and primary or secondary outcomes. We checked medical records and interviewed a parent using a standard questionnaire to confirm that there was no previous wheezing episode.

However, our results suggest that prednisolone treatment is beneficial in a subgroup of young children with high viral loads at presentation. The apparent effect of prednisolone on long-term outcomes among children with high rhinovirus loads and its benefits on most short-term outcomes warrant further study. Clinically, the challenge is early identification of children at high risk of asthma and identification of an effective intervention to reduce respiratory morbidity. A rhinovirus-related cause of early wheezing is a promising new marker for these high-risk children,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and clearly, there is a need for a bedside quantitative rhinovirus detection test. Our RCT findings support a role for high rhinovirus load as an important marker in those children with early pulmonary inflammation who might benefit from acute treatment with prednisolone.Key messages\n\u2022Despite some benefits in secondary short-term outcomes, prednisolone cannot be routinely recommended for all children with their first acute rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode because it did not affect primary long-term outcomes.\u2022Interestingly, prednisolone decreased relapses in those with a high rhinovirus load, suggesting early pulmonary inflammation in these children.\n\n",
