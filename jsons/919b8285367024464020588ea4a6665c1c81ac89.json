The viruses known as human coronavirus (hCoV)-229E, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43 are of little concern at a global public health level. Two other coronaviruses have caused significant epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), one in China during 2002 -2003 and the other one confined to regions of the Middle East (MERS-CoV), emerging in 2012 and showing limited human-to-human transmission but a high case fatality ratio (CFR) [1] . At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus causing a severe acute respiratory symptom (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China rapidly spreading around the world resulting in a new coronavirus disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 . After an initial lag phase, cases of COVID-19 followed an exponential curve and spread around the world affecting more than 1.8 million over 185 countries on Easter Day. Precision medicine (PM) is an emerging new paradigm in disease management [2 \u2022\u2022 ] . PM develops on recent advances in omic sciences, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, applying them to the evaluation and treatment of health disorders.",

The remainder of the genome codes for structural proteins and carries the accessory genes that produce virions and alter the host response. Early studies on SARS-CoV-2 have shown further similarities with its namesake virus in that the spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cell surface receptor [5, 6] .

The destruction of epithelial cells and the increase of cell permeability lead to the release of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune system; macrophages and other innate immune cells not only capture the virus but also release a large number of cytokines and chemokines. Adaptive immunity is also activated by antigen-presenting cells (mainly dendritic cells). T and B cells not only play an antiviral role but also directly or indirectly promote the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, under the stimulation of inflammatory factors, a large number of inflammatory exudates and erythrocytes enter the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea and respiratory failure [34] .",

Two hundred eighty of them are interventional studies classified into 33 categories of drugs interventions ( Table 1) . Most of them fall into one of two categories: (1) Treating respiratory symptoms, especially the inflammation that occurs in severe cases, and (2) antiviral growth, essentially stopping viruses from multiplying inside the human body. There are other outcomes such as to reduce organ failure and to treat pneumonia and/or sepsis, among others ( Table 2) . In this article, we will briefly describe the most promising and cost/accessible drugs.

They propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, the USA) have been more severely affected than countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality suggests that BCG vaccination might be a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.",
