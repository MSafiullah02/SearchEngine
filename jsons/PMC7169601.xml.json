Although it can occur at any time, rumour mongering is particularly prominent during moments of crisis and turmoil when uncertainties and anxieties run high. Rumours serve both as barometers of individual states of mind (Rosnow 1988), and as benchmarks for collective consciousness and group problem solving (Shibutani 1966, Bordia and DiFonzo 2002). The study of rumours, Dingwall (2001: 198) argues, has the potential to contribute to the sociology of health and illness by aiding our understanding of \u2018lay health knowledge and beliefs and the situated basis of health\u2010relevant actions\u2019. Likewise, as Wright and Nerlich (2009) demonstrate through their examination of rumours in circulation during the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) crisis in Britain, rumours can be fruitfully analysed to shed light on the three types of psycho\u2010social epidemics \u2013 namely, an epidemic of fear, an epidemic of explanation, and an epidemic of action or proposed action \u2013 that Strong (1990) conceptualises subsequent to a major disease outbreak.",

Specifically, by content analysing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, SARS\u2010related rumours as covered by major Chinese newspapers, this study investigates patterns of relationship between rumour incidences and SARS infections across different regions and examines thematic manifestations in the rumour content during the outbreak of the disease in China. The results offer insight into the nature of rumouring at times of a major public health crisis and information scarcity, especially against the backdrop of superstitious medical beliefs and folk health practices in the rich terrain of Chinese popular culture.",

            "text": "Academic literature has typically defined rumours as propositions or hypotheses which, by way of unverified information, help people construct sensible interpretations of particular situations under circumstances of ambiguity and uncertainty. In their seminal text, Allport and Postman (1965: 34, emphasis in the original) proposed the widely\u2010cited formula which projects \u2018the amount of rumour in circulation will vary with the importance of the subject to the individual concerned times the ambiguity of the evidence pertaining to the topic at issue\u2019. Besides importance and ambiguity, Rosnow (1991) identifies at least four additional conditions that interact with the process of rumour mongering: general uncertainty; outcome\u2010relevant involvement; personal anxiety; and credulity. In a similar vein, Bordia and DiFonzo (2002) pinpoint four micro\u2010level (individual) variables that affect the outcome of the rumour process \u2013 namely, anxiety, uncertainty, importance, and belief. Additionally, perceived threat is often cited as a triggering condition for rumouring (DiFonzo and Bordia 2007). It is no wonder then that catastrophic situations such as the Second World War (Allport and Postman 1965), the calamitous earthquake in India in 1934 (Prasad 1935), and the deadly Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986 (Rahu 2003), would document colossal rumour activities.",

The sociological framework finds best expression in the work of Shibutani (1966), who conceives rumour as a special type of \u2018improvised news\u2019 while people caught in an ambiguous situation engage in the process of collective problem\u2010solving by pooling together their intellectual resources in an effort to assign meaning to unexplained facts. This theoretical formulation is echoed by Kapferer (1990), who argues that rumour, as the group\u2019s voice, symbolises shared but suppressed group fears and beliefs. Because there is an elevated need for cognitive clarity (Rosnow and Fine 1976), rumouring is conceptualised by Turner (1994) to be an act of intensified collective information seeking \u2013 a natural shift\u2010over from information sifting under circumstances of increased, specified, or authenticated threats.",

            "text": "As for the situations that contribute to rumour proliferation, Shibutani (1966) notes that rumour is rife when institutionalised channels of communication break down or when they are no longer trusted by the public. At the social structural level, Turner (1964) points to four scenarios that lead to rumouring: when stable accommodations for the pursuit of everyday life are threatened; when the formal structure of a society no longer facilitates information circulation; when events occur that disrupt the normal understandings of daily routines; and when there is a strong shared incentive to use rumour to justify normatively prescribed collective behaviour (see also Dingwall 2001, Shaw and Woodward 2004). Prasad (1935: 5) describes a typical situation leading to the growth of rumour as one which: \u2018(a) sets up an emotional disturbance; (b) is of an uncommon and unfamiliar type; (c) contains many aspects unknown to the individuals affected; (d) contains several unverifiable factors; (e) is of group interest\u2019. Noticeably, both Prasad and Turner effectively involve the individuals in the rumour processes in a particular group or social climate.",

In line with Allport and Postman\u2019s (1965: 170) observation that \u2018The rumour pie may be sliced in many ways\u2019, rumours have been classified in a number of ways based on the subject matter, the interests of the researchers, and the specific situations under investigation. In broad sweeps, a distinction is often made between two types of rumours: wish rumours (i.e. those invoking hoped\u2010for consequences), and dread rumours (i.e. those incurring feared or disappointing results) (Rosnow et al. 1986). In his extensive study of 1000 rumours being circulated in the United States during the Second World War, Knapp (1944) identified three types of rumours based on motivational factors: \u2018pipe dream\u2019 (or wish\u2010fulfilment) rumours (those that reflect wished\u2010for outcomes); \u2018bogies\u2019 (or fear rumours, those that invoke feared or anxiety\u2010inducing outcomes); and \u2018wedge drivers\u2019 (or aggressive rumours, those that derogate certain groups or classes of people). To these three, Allport and Postman (1965) added a fourth type \u2013 the \u2018home\u2010stretch\u2019 rumours, or those that are generated through a much\u2010anticipated finale of great importance.",

            "text": "Carl Jung distinguished between two ordinary and visionary rumours in his psychoanalytic framework. The former need nothing more than \u2018popular curiosity and sensation\u2010mongering\u2019 (Jung 1959: 6), to disseminate. The latter, on the other hand, are caused by primordial visions and archetypal psychic processes embedded in the subconscious human minds; they are our psychological projections of the human world in the higher world and supernatural forces at moments of collective distress and uncertainty. It has also been noted that some rumours are \u2018spontaneous\u2019 or \u2018extemporaneous\u2019 in the sense they emerge naturally in a crisis situation and other rumours are \u2018deliberate\u2019 (Shibutani 1966), or \u2018premeditated\u2019 (Kimmel 2003), in that they are manufactured to serve a predefined purpose. Notwithstanding these diverse efforts to classify rumours, it must be pointed out that no single unified, all\u2010inclusive scheme can disentangle the complex rumour dynamics under different conditions. What we need is a situation\u2010based, context\u2010dependent analytical framework (Bordia and DiFonzo 2002), built on \u2018methodological pluralism and theoretical ecumenism\u2019 (Rosnow 1988: 15), in order to piece together the rumour puzzle.",

Rumours that accorded with cultural traditions of the group found fertile ground in society during the Second World War (Knapp 1944). Similarly, in the disastrous Indian earthquake of 1934, rumours that were \u2018couched in terms of the traditional and cultural heritage peculiar to the group\u2019 (Prasad 1935: 7), gained widespread currency. In cross\u2010examining earthquake\u2010related rumours in historical accounts in India and other countries, Prasad found that certain forms and content of rumour tend to recur across all societies caught in similar catastrophic situations, and he argued that these thematically\u2010repeating rumours reveal the human disposition to revert to \u2018cultural and social inheritance\u2019 such as \u2018traditions, mythical beliefs, superstitions and legends\u2019 under conditions of stress (Prasad 1950: 141).",

Smith (1984), in discussing what he characterised as the \u2018fluid\u2019 relationship between contemporary legend and rumour, identifies this type of rumour as \u2018legendary rumours\u2019 because they embed tradition in news\u2010like narratives directed against named individuals or institutions. However, despite their thematic similarities, urban legends are a form of metaphorical storytelling detached by time and space limitations (Brunvand 1989), while rumours premised on pre\u2010existing cultural themes are temporally and locally situated (Miller 2005).",

In the Ming and Qing dynasties of imperial China, rumours were rampant across the nation, playing on the popular belief in the disruptive and hideous nature of demons, barbarians, sorcerers, and evil spirits (Kuhn 1990, ter Haar 2006). The tumultuous period at the turn of the twentieth century in China was especially marred by outbursts of this type of rumours (Cohen 1998).

The outbreak of the lethal virus in Guangdong in early 2003 prompted a site investigation by an expert team comprising officials from the provincial government and the national Ministry of Health, which concluded on 21 January that the infection was atypical pneumonia and recommended measures of prevention and treatment. The team\u2019s findings and recommendations \u2013 despite their timely distribution to every hospital in the province upon release \u2013 did not receive much attention from health administrators, most of whom were on leave for the Chinese Spring Festival holiday.

Concerned over the severity of the situation, the WHO questioned the Chinese government on 10 February, and received an official report from Chinese authorities the next day describing an outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome with 305 infected cases and five deaths in Guangdong province. At the same time, in order to quell mass panic and maintain public order, local health officials held a press conference in Guangzhou on 11 February pronouncing the epidemic under control.

On 12 March, the WHO issued a global alert on the epidemic, and followed up with three further alerts in the same month on the detection and prevention of the disease. While mounting evidence in mid to late March from worldwide infections pointed to Guangdong as the origin of the SARS virus, little information was made available through the state\u2010sanctioned Chinese media, and Chinese government officials vehemently denied accusations from the international media that they were covering up SARS infections in China. Rising global pressure, however, forced the Chinese authorities to react. On 2 April, a State Council executive meeting was convened in Beijing specifically to discuss SARS prevention and control, leading to the establishment of a national emergency response committee to combat the disease. A turning point in official strategy finally came about on 17 April after an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the highest decision\u2010making body in Chinese polity. At the meeting, Chinese President Hu Jintao demanded an accurate, timely and honest reporting of the SARS situation at all levels of government agencies, and vowed to punish any act of disease information cover\u2010up. From late April to June, a state\u2010initiated anti\u2010SARS \u2018People\u2019s War\u2019 was staged across China incorporating the participation of government agencies, the mass media, neighbourhood committees and institutional organizations.

However, as Rosnow (2001) notes, this assumption is invalidated by the current information environment saturated by different platforms of mass media and emerging channels of computer\u2010mediated communication over the internet (see also Bordia and DiFonzo 2004). Our findings indicate that word of mouth still played a vital role in the spread of SARS\u2010related rumours. Among the 68 rumours with which specific channels of transmission have been identified in the news reports, about 40 per cent (N = 27) are associated with word of mouth. Although the mode of communication was not specifically mentioned in the news stories for as many as 23 of the rumours (probably because this was not of primary concern to the reporters), inferences can be made for the majority of them that these rumours were mainly spread verbally. Side by side with word\u2010of\u2010mouth transmission is the conspicuous presence of the internet in the rumouring process, with 26 rumours finding life in online BBS and chat rooms. Supplementing word of mouth and the internet are a variety of informal personal networks interconnected via SMS (N = 18), conventional phone calls (N = 8) and emails (N = 7). These are essentially today\u2019s grapevines that, by plugging interpersonal relationships into emerging technological devices, provide vital channels of communication at times of unfolding crisis. The prominent role of the internet and SMS in rumour mongering is highly consistent with the observation by Tai and Sun (2007) concerning the heavy dependence on the internet and SMS by the general public in the communication of SARS\u2010related information during the epidemic.",

The 91 rumours identified in our study, we decided, were best divided into four distinct types according to their thematic prominence: legendary rumours; aetiological narratives; proto\u2010memorates; and bogies. Legendary rumours \u2013 a term we borrow from Smith (1984)\u2013 include a variety of narrative forms that relate individual life and events in the setting of the SARS epidemic to traditional accounts of folktales and urban legends.

The widespread occurrence of this type of rumour is quite understandable considering the lack of critical information on the novel but fatal virus from the state\u2010controlled media outlets in the early stages during the SARS episode. The third category, proto\u2010memorates, encompasses those rumours that offer various types of alleged testimonials of SARS infections in different localities. The credulity of this type of rumour rests on what appears to be some kind of first\u2010hand, eyewitness account of SARS contractions in the asserted vicinity. The term \u2018memorate\u2019 was first proposed by Carl Wilhelm von Sydow (as opposed to \u2018fabulate\u2019) to refer to a particular narrative genre that circulates by reproducing people\u2019s \u2018own, purely personal experiences\u2019 to an interested audience (cited in D\u00e9gh and V\u00e1zsonyi 1974: 225). However, as D\u00e9gh and V\u00e1zsonyi (1974: 226) point out, the classic Sydowian formulation in its strict interpretation must mean that \u2018a memorate can be known only by that single person and respectively by as many people as heard it from him [or her]\u2019. In the folklore tradition, nevertheless, the multi\u2010conduit and multi\u2010channel nature of transmission makes it hard, if not impossible, to distinguish memorates from memorate\u2010derivatives. Therefore, D\u00e9gh and V\u00e1zsonyi call all postulative (i.e. real as well as inferential) memorates \u2018proto\u2010memorates\u2019. We hence adapt this term to refer to variants of eyewitness\u2010account types of rumours by stressing their told\u2010by\u2010friend\u2010of\u2010a\u2010friend nature of transmission in the rumouring chain.",

The distribution of the remaining three types spreads quite evenly on the rumour spectrum, with legendary rumours and bogies making up about 22 per cent and aetiological narratives constituting about 23 per cent of the total incidences. It is a much more divergent picture, however, when we examine the frequency with which each type of rumour is mentioned across the news. Specifically, each legendary rumour averages about 6.4 mentions, followed distantly by a bogie\u2019s 3.3. Aetiological narratives, on the other hand, score an average of 2.3 listings, and proto\u2010memorates, despite their dominant status in the total number of rumour cases, are the least likely to be repeated across stories (mean = 1.4). If we take the average number of mentions across multiple news stories as a valid measure of the amplitude of cross\u2010regional rumour mongering (i.e. the degree to which a particular rumour is likely to recur across varying regions), then our evidence strongly suggests that legendary rumours made the strongest splashes at the times of the SARS crisis while proto\u2010memorates were the most constrained in recurrence. This pattern suggests that legendary rumours, by embedding current events in cultural values and traditional beliefs, would be more likely to reverberate in the public imagination irrespective of location, whereas proto\u2010memorates would be of primary peddling value to the local audience.",

These beliefs and prescriptive behaviours are intricately consistent with the repertoire of century\u2010old Chinese religious, mythological and cosmological rituals of offering food and spirit money to worship, and pray for the blessings of, gods, ghosts and ancestors (Wolf 1974, McCreery 1990, Anagnost 1987, Sangren 1987), and the well\u2010trodden Chinese folklore traditions of public s\u00e9ances and spirit mediums practised by \u2018old ladies who speak to spirits\u2019 to save mundane souls from deity\u2010inflicted illnesses (Potter 1974: 207).",

All these rumours are well entrenched in popular Chinese folklore beliefs in viewing an assortment of supernatural and paranormal phenomena as ominous signs of imminent danger and pending disasters (Wang and Xu 1992). A remarkable feature about the legendary rumours is that their path of circulation is predominantly traced to rural and outland regions in China: among the 17 legendary rumours for which particular localities of spread were identified, 16 of them were associated primarily with remote villages and faraway townships, and the one that had an urban life was circulated in the northern city of Tianjin. Thus an unmistakable pattern for contemporary urban legends in China is its rural nature of vitality. The most plausible explanation lies in the socio\u2010geographic nature of China\u2019s population demographics: compared with their rural counterparts, city dwellers are generally better educated, and have easier access to modern medical facilities and high\u2010quality public health information.

A substantial number (13 out of 21) of rumours in this group focus on a variety of preventive measures, such as drinking isatis root granules (a popular way to enhance immunity in traditional Chinese medicine), consuming iodised salt, practising Falun Gong, smoking nicotine, fumigating vinegar, drinking Chinese white liquor, body\u2010washing in salt water, using transfer factors and immunoglobulin, and injecting imported flu and other vaccines.\n4\n In relation to its causes, SARS has been rumoured to be a mutant strain of avian flu/mouse plague/anthrax, or a particular type of US\u2010developed biochemical virus, or a genealogical variant of the bird flu virus that had occurred in Hong Kong a few years earlier. Additionally, one rumour attributes the cause of SARS to iodine deficiency \u2013 this is a word play on feidian, an abbreviation of \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 in Chinese, as the first Chinese character fei means non, and the second character, dian, is homophonous with the Chinese word for iodine.

The strong correlation between rumour infections and rumour incidences across the different regions in China revealed in this study suggests that higher levels of virus incursions created a more fertile rumouring environment as people struggled to make sense of an unfolding public health crisis in the absence of reliable information. With respect to channels of dissemination, while SARS rumouring still found prolificity in word of mouth, new platforms of communication led by internet\u2010based forums, BBS, and online chat rooms as well as emerging networks of cell\u2010phone\u2010based text messaging also played important roles.

As socio\u2010cultural constructions of clinical and medical realities, theories of disease aetiology have been developed cross\u2010culturally to reflect the specific \u2018living conditions and resources\u2019 of the various peoples throughout human history (Baer et al. 1997: 191\u2013208). By tapping into the age\u2010old repertoire of magico\u2010religious beliefs and practices, legendary rumours present a variety of discourses that correspond well to the theories of supernatural causation as elaborated in Murdock\u2019s (1980) scheme of disease aetiology. Murdock\u2019s cross\u2010national analysis of data from 186 societies led him to identify three theories with which people posit their maladies and ailments to supernatural assumptions: theories of mystical causation; theories of animistic causation; and theories of magical causation (Murdock 1980:17\u201327). All these three types of theories have found manifestations in the list of legendary rumours identified in our study. Thus superstitious beliefs and practices are alive and well in China, and they still play a prominent role in people\u2019s life at times of major epidemic crisis.",

            "text": "Aetiological narratives present theories of natural causation and healing in relation to SARS. The overwhelming focus on preventive and healing measures reflect the widespread panic and soaring anxiety as well as the prevailing desperation among the general public in the face of an unknown fatal virus. At the same time, people tend to look for therapeutic solutions in their pools of established, familiar routines to build the first line of defence. Proto\u2010memorates and bogies, on the other hand, are primarily voluntary acts by the public to improvise news in response to the inaction of the state\u2010sanctioned media at moments of a major crisis. The most convincing evidence to support this point comes from the finding that rumouring stories of local infections dominate all subcategories of incidences.",

            "text": "With regard to recurrence, legendary rumours are by far the most likely to find resonance across regions, while proto\u2010memorates tend to be the most local in circulation and the least likely to repeat in other localities. In relation to timing, swirling rumours in the early stages displayed a lopsided focus on the causes and prevention of the disease, and legendary rumours dominated rumouring activities in the later stages. As Smith (2006) observes, despite intensive government onslaught in the decades under Mao\u2019s rule, superstitious rumours maintained a vigorous existence, and they staged a remarkable resurgence in the post\u2010Mao reform era. The vitality of this comeback, our evidence suggests, is the most ferocious in rural and outland areas.",
