Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 61%, normal right ventricular systolic function, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 57 mm Hg. Noninvasive cardiac output monitor (FloTrac; Edwards Lifesciences Corp) showed severely reduced vascular resistance and high cardiac output. Although corticosteroids are not recommended for COVID-19, stress dose methylprednisolone was added for refractory septic shock. Ang-2 (10 ng/kg/min) was added as the third vasopressor.

The present patient had ARDS and was taking an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril).
