FHCs were previously called periventricular cavitation [2], frontal periventricular cysts [3], or transient bifrontal solitary periventricular cysts [4]. Sometimes they are classified together with cysts in the caudothalamic notch (subependymal cysts) as subependymal pseudocysts [5], [6], [7]. They may be confused with subependymal cysts or periventricular leukomalacia, but their prevalence, location, sonographic appearance, etiology, and outcome are different [8], [9], [10], [11].",

They are not at the most vulnerable germinal matrix where subependymal cysts happen. No concomitant cranial ultrasound abnormalities, especially subependymal cysts, were found on initial examination.

Rosenfeld et al. suggested that FHC occurred secondary to a coarctation of the lateral ventricle rather than as a sequela of hemorrhage or ischemia [7]. Pal et al. thought that FHC could be explained by initial secretory activity of the ependymal lining, allowing the cyst to increase in size as the surrounding brain grew. In this view, loss of ependymal cells or of their secretory function results in cyst shrinkage. This hypothesis has histological support from an autopsy case [1]. No definite etiology could be identified in our infants.",

This suggests that FHC has little to do with prematurity and its associated stress. The benign outcome may be due to no important tract pass through the frontal horn area. Given these reports and, in our series, the similar elliptical, smooth, thin-walled appearance, their fixed location and similar incidence between prematurity and term baby, the absence of destruction of the surrounding brain tissue and absence of concomitant cranial ultrasound abnormalities, the normal perinatal history and subsequent development, we suspect that typical FHC may be a normal physiologic variant or a benign pathologic condition.",

And according to the Rademaker KJ et al., the frontal horn cyst is located at the external angle below the level of the lateral ventricles, whereas cysts occurring in periventricular leukomalacia extend above this level [6]. The only atypical cyst in our series did enlarge somewhat and had an initial mass effect, but the child's subsequent course was uneventful. More frequent follow up for an atypical FHC may be necessary, as the prognosis is not as clear as for typical cysts. Further, image studies like MRI or CT should be considered. While it may be a variant FHC, it may also belong to a different subset of intracranial cysts with a different prognosis.",
