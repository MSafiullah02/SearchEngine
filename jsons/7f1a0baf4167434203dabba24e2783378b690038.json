The most common notifiable infectious diseases among asylum seekers were tuberculosis, malaria, and chronic hepatitis B. These are some of the highlights of a report on infectious diseases in the Netherlands in 2015. These reports are published every year by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), and provide policy-makers at the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) with insight into infectious disease trends in the Dutch population.

All cases were reported from the last two poliomyelitis-endemic countries: Pakistan (54) and Afghanistan (20) . In 2015, there were less cases in fewer places than ever before. In 2015, seven countries reported cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) (Box 2.1). Circulating VDPV type 1 was detected in Madagascar (10) , Lao PDR (8) and Ukraine (2) ; circulating VDPV type 2 was detected in Guinea (7), Myanmar (2), Pakistan (2) and Nigeria (1) . In 1988, the World Health Assembly committed to eradicate the disease. Since then, the number of cases has considerably decreased. Of the three types of wild polioviruses, type 2 is considered to be eradicated, as the last case was reported in 1999. The last case of wild poliovirus type 3 was reported in November 2012. In 2016, every country in the world currently using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has to withdraw the trivalent vaccine and replace it with the bivalent vaccine, containing live poliovirus type 1 and 3. This will continue to protect infants from poliovirus types 1 and 3. By withdrawing the type 2 component, the risk of seeding new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus is avoided. With replacement of the trivalent OPV with bivalent OPV, the immunity against type 2 is induced by including at least one trivalent IPV dose in the vaccination schedule (http://www.polioeradication.org/).",

Because of enterovirus-surveillance, the latter was typed showing a poliovirus type 3 strain. Further sequence analysis of the complete VP1 gene showed a unique VDPV-3. The GGD in collaboration with the RIVM and the hospital conducted source and contact tracing. The child arrived in the Netherlands in 2014 and had probably received trivalent oral polio vaccination on the journey from Syria to the Netherlands. The child showed no polio symptoms. Multiple follow-up samples showed negative results for poliovirus. Fecal examinations of the family were also negative for poliovirus. Sewage surveillance was conducted in the area where the child lives, showing no poliovirus. As all follow up samples were negative, the VDPV was identified as an ambiguous VDPV (aVDPV).",

When a child is vaccinated, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the intestine and enters into the bloodstream, triggering a protective immune response in the child. As with wild poliovirus, the child excretes the vaccine-virus for a period of two to eight weeks. Importantly, some of the excreted viruses may no longer be the same as the original vaccine-virus, as they have genetically altered during replication. This is called a vaccine-derived poliovirus. Very rarely, vaccine-derived poliovirus can cause paralysis.

Also, the B viruses that circulated in higher proportions later in the season were not optimally comparable with the vaccine components. In addition, these viruses were also antigenic-drifted compared with the viruses circulating in previous seasons, resulting in reduced immune protection in the general -not vaccinated -population (6) . Due to increasing numbers of reported cases of microcephaly in Brazil since late 2015, and multiple cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) in the outbreak areas, a potential association between ZIKV infection and these disorders was suggested. Hence, on 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the recent clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders and the possible association with ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (9) . Based on multiple case reports of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded in April 2016 that a causal relationship exists between prenatal ZIKV infection and microcephaly and other brain disorders (10) . Furthermore, an association of ZIKV infection with GBS has been observed in a case-control study in French Polynesia (11) . ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes spp. mosquito vectors, mainly Ae. aegypti, which is widespread in (sub)tropical regions and which is also one of the main vectors of dengue and chikungunya. In addition, the virus has been detected in Ae. albopictus, which has been shown to be a moderately competent vector for ZIKV by experimental infection (12) . In Europe, Ae. albopictus has been established in multiple countries, including Italy, Southern France and Spain, whereas Ae. aegypti has only been established on the island of Madeira and in Northeastern Turkey (13) . Given the history of autochthonous cases of chikungunya and dengue in some European countries in the past, limited local transmission of ZIKV after introduction of a viremic traveler cannot be excluded in regions where a suitable vector is present. In addition to mosquito-borne transmission, other transmission routes have been suggested, including trans-placental and blood-transfusion mediated transmission (10, 14) . Unlike other arboviruses, sexual transmission of ZIKV is also possible and is of particular concern during pregnancy (14). Zikavirus has been detected in semen of symptomatically infected males, and multiple case reports have been published of probable cases of sexual transmission from infected males to their otherwise unexposed sexual partners (14) . In September 2016, the notification requirements for ZIKV will be implemented in the Netherlands as well as the overseas Dutch territories, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba. The notification requirement will be restricted to confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy, in a woman who has undergone (spontaneous) abortion, in newborns with congenital disorders, in hospitalized ZIKV-infected persons, fatal ZIKV infections, and in persons who developed GBS as a result of ZIKV infection.",

Both patients were admitted to the ICU for supportive treatment and recovered fully without further complications. Control measures were taken in the asylum center constituting of washing clothes and bed linen, and doctors from the Asylum Seekers Health Center were informed to be alert for LBRF cases. Twenty-seven confirmed cases of LBRF were diagnosed in EU countries and Switzerland between July and October 2015. Almost all diagnosed cases were refugees from countries of the Horn of Africa. LBRF is highly endemic in northeastern Africa. LBRF is caused by the spirochaete Borrelia recurrentis. The onset of symptoms is usually sudden. Symptoms include high fever, general malaise, chills and sweats, headache, meningism, myalgia/arthralgia and non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting), but can also include mucocutaneous symptoms and cardiorespiratory symptoms. The symptoms increase in intensity over five days on average (range: 2-7), then subside as the pathogenic agent disappears from the blood. After a first remission, spirochetes reappear in the blood and symptoms recur. The disease can be severe, and death occurs in 10% to 40% of cases in the absence of appropriate treatment, and in 2-5% of treated patients. After initiation of treatment there is a high risk (90%) of developing a (severe) Jarisch Herxheimer reaction. Primary prevention of LBRF relies on measures for avoiding infestation with body lice. These infestations are linked to low socioeconomic status, overcrowding, and poor personal hygiene. Historically, major outbreaks of LBRF occurred in Eurasia and Africa, but currently the disease is primarily found in northeastern Africa. No cases of LBRF infections acquired in the Netherlands have been reported since 1990. ",

This was possibly the first form of surveillance which led to public health measures being taken by a government in Europe. The detention of travelers from plague-infected areas for 40 days in Marseille and Venice resulted in the birth of quarantine as a means of controlling the spread of infectious diseases (1). Another early example of surveillance was that during plague epidemics in London in the seventeenth century. Prior to this, in plague years, data were collected centrally and sporadically. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, London clerks produced regular weekly reports on the number of burials and the cause of death. This information was interpreted and disseminated in a weekly 'Bill of Mortality'. This early surveillance system illustrates the main principles of surveillance, which are still in use: systematic, ongoing data collection and analysis, interpretation to provide information, and timely dissemination of that information for action (1) .",

Most people do not seek health care for their illnesses, and even among individuals who seek care, many do not have a laboratory test. Laboratory testing does not always identify a pathogen, and even when a specific microorganism is identified, this may not be the cause of the disease, and physicians may not report all illnesses to public health authorities. Further, it may not be evident that patients are connected to a common exposure, so outbreaks could go undetected and unreported.

Eyeballing these surveillance data by an expert is a common method for outbreak detection, which works effectively when only a few cases of a certain disease occur. For some diseases (Ebola, MERS-CoV, polio etc.), just a single case is already 'more than expected' and hence sufficient to declare an outbreak. If diseases occur more frequently, algorithms are needed and can be applied to the data gathered during routine surveillance to detect outbreaks. The Stroup algorithm (19) , for example, is applied to the notifiable disease surveillance database, and the results are visualized real-time in the 'barometer' for expert use (20) (Figure 3.3 ). This is a website with restricted access, as notifications which are still in the verification process are also included. In this algorithm, the number of notifications in the past four weeks is compared to the expected value. The expected value is calculated by taking the average of the number of notifications of the same four weeks in the past five years and the four weeks before and after this period in the past five years (so the average of 15 periods of four weeks in total). The current number is considered an increase if the number is higher than the expected value plus two standard deviations. All increases are reviewed on a weekly basis by a member of the NEWC. In addition to the Stroup algorithm, other algorithms have been developed to detect outbreaks across time. A detailed overview of these can be found elsewhere (21) . A limitation of using notification data for detecting outbreaks in time, is that notifications are always reported with a delay. An algorithm was developed during the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, which predicts the current number of notifications taking into account the reporting delay ('nowcasting') (22) . This algorithm was also used in the measles outbreak in 2012-2013, to get a more real-time overview of the outbreak situation.",

Assessing clustering in place usually starts with displaying the cases reported in a specific time period on a map. This is, for example, regularly done for Legionellosis in the Netherlands. Whether clustering is present can be assessed visually by the specific disease expert or can be assessed by applying an algorithm. A frequently used algorithm is the space-time scan statistic developed by Kulldorf (23) which is integrated in the SaTScan statistical software program (24) . It can be used to detect clusters in space and/or time. The algorithm scans using a window across time and/or space, and calculates the number of observed and expected cases inside each window at each location. In the Netherlands, the space-time scan statistic is not used on a routine basis for outbreak detection, as most clusters can already be detected by reviewing the map. However, in certain specific situations, the space-time statistic is applied to confirm or refute an observed clustering. For example, in 2013, an unusual increase in hepatitis B cases was observed in a specific region of the Netherlands. The scan-statistic was used to check whether significant clustering in time and space occurred, and a local cluster was found to be present among men who have sex with men (MSM) and men with an unknown route of transmission (25) .",

The personal characteristics of infectious diseases (e.g. age, gender, risk group, occupation) are gathered during routine surveillance and are analyzed on a regular basis. An unexpected pattern in personal characteristics can be used to detect outbreaks, provided the characteristics are documented in the surveillance system. For age and sex, this is usually the case. For other characteristics, surveillance may need to be adapted to collect the information following external signals of an outbreak in a specific group. These signals are usually generated by alert clinicians and microbiologists. An example of outbreak detection by personal characteristics is the start of the measles outbreak in 2013 (26) . In the Netherlands, several measles cases are usually notified annually, which in itself is not sufficient to define it as an outbreak. However, when a measles case occurs in an unvaccinated orthodox Protestant individual, such as in 2013, a major outbreak is much more likely, as vaccination levels among orthodox Protestants are very low.",

The resulting data can be used in laboratory surveillance to detect outbreaks: by typing a specific pathogen, a cluster of patients with a new strain/subtype might indicate an outbreak. For example, in February 2010, the Dutch virology reference laboratory for hepatitis A-virus (HAV) detected a new strain in five patients (27) . They had no travel history to HAV-endemic countries and this unusual situation led to an outbreak investigation. After thorough investigation, semi-dried tomatoes were indicated as the source of infection for this cluster of cases, however, these results could not be confirmed by food testing (28) . There are many (molecular) typing methods available, and depending on the epidemiological question and the time available for analysis, they may be more or less appropriate. In order to use typing for outbreak detection, the typing method should ideally be able to distinguish all epidemiologically related cases, and should have sufficient discriminatory power to reveal person-toperson transmission (29) . The typing method with the highest discriminatory power is whole genome sequencing (WGS). This does not mean that WGS is always needed. While WGS has become more affordable and therefore more used in recent years, the main challenge lies in rapidly computing and interpreting the relevant information from the large data sets WGS produces. Access to relevant data on background distribution of WGS is needed to interpret clusters, but is often lacking. Currently, WGS is rarely used in the Netherlands to aid outbreak detection, however, research is ongoing and the use of WGS in routine surveillance might be possible in the near future. Currently, a major research project has been started, with the aim of implementing WGS for tuberculosis surveillance (30) .",

The added value of the Farrington algorithm compared to the Stroup algorithm is that it accounts for trends and corrects for past outbreaks by downweighting outliers in the regression process.

Finally, for all detected clusters in time, the median distance between patients in this cluster is calculated and these are also depicted in the graph. Clusters below the P2.5 threshold are considered to be clustered in space and time. The third step is to look at the age distribution of the significant time clusters. This age-distribution is tested against the age-distribution of all type-specific historical salmonella cases using a Chi-square test. This is evaluated for time windows of different sizes. All timeclusters are flagged and reviewed by a salmonella expert; weekly about a thousand salmonella types are reviewed in this way. An overview of these three steps is shown in Figure 3 .6. ",

Trends are independent of seasonal patterns; a yearly increase in influenza during the winter season is not considered a trend. When the occurrence of a disease, adjusted for seasonal patterns, changes over time, this is called a secular trend. A trend can also be specific to certain risk groups. Analysis of surveillance data for long-term trends is important, as gradual changes might otherwise go unnoticed while they may provide important information about changes in epidemiology and the need to modify control efforts.",

This is a result of season-specific changes in human behavior (e.g. crowding, travel) and/or in the environment (e.g. humidity, vector biology), which may favor survival and/or transmission of pathogens. The 'flu season' is probably the best-known example of seasonality in infectious disease. Influenza, but also many other pathogens causing respiratory infections, have an increased incidence during the winter. This is due to several causes, such as crowding and air humidity (33, 34) . In addition to the flu season, more infectious disease seasons exist. For example, foodborne infections increase during the summer (due, for example, to inadequate meat heating on barbecues) and travel-related illnesses such as malaria and typhoid fever are mostly seen at the end of the summer holidays. In these cases, the seasonality of the disease is driven mostly by human behavior. Knowledge about seasonality can inform policy or advice. In the summer, awareness of safe food preparation is stimulated, while during the winter, health promotion includes information on cough and sneeze hygiene. In the Netherlands, every year in April, awareness is raised regarding tick bites and Lyme disease, in order to promote preventive measures in the population. Despite the relatively predictable nature of seasonal patterns, they are also analyzed using surveillance data. After all, it is important to assess whether a disease season has shown a different timing, duration or severity than usual, or whether risk groups were differentially affected. It is also important to monitor which pathogens or strains are dominant, since this varies between seasons and can affect vaccine or treatment effectiveness. Awareness of the onset of the influenza season is important for health professionals, so public health actions can be aptly timed. Also, knowledge about the onset and characteristics of an influenza epidemic can aid health care planning, such as hospital bed availability. If an increase in disease occurrence is expected, such as at the beginning of the influenza season, it is difficult to detect an outbreak or epidemic of this disease. Still, each year an announcement is made that 'an influenza epidemic has started' at a certain point in time. This epidemic is not simply defined as the onset of increasing disease occurrence, but rather as a certain incidence among the population. For influenza in the Netherlands, the threshold for influenza epidemics is an incidence of influenza-like illness of 51 per 100,000 inhabitants, for two weeks in a row. Seasonality is a form of periodicity. Certain infectious diseases also exhibit other types of periodicity and show epidemics recurring every few years (35, 36) . Such a pattern is usually explained by a build-up period of a new 'pool of susceptibles', a non-immune population large enough to lead to a new outbreak. Therefore, this type of periodicity is mostly described for infections after which immunity is retained for a long time. However, there are more drivers of such recurring epidemics, such as population density, mobility and demography (37) . Of course, vaccination coverage and possible herd immunity strongly influence the chance of disease recurrence.",

The threshold used in the Netherlands is based on a method developed by Tom\u00e1s Vega Alonso et al. (39, 40) This method makes use of information from previous influenza seasons. As a first step, it defines the duration of the epidemic per season. To determine the number of weeks that best describes the duration of each season, the number of weeks is plotted against the percentage of all influenza cases occurring in those weeks (Figure 3.8) . Naturally, the more weeks included, the more influenza cases covered. To find the optimum number of weeks describing the duration of the epidemic, the point is sought where the slope of the curve decreases most strongly. In other words, the minimum number of weeks covering the maximum number of cases is defined as the duration of the season. After the durations have been calculated for each season, the onset of each season is defined by starting the epidemic at the optimum week number, so that the epidemic contains the maximum number of cases. When the onset is defined, the maximum number of cases in the \"pre-epidemic period\" is found. An average of the highest weekly number of cases in pre-epidemic periods of past influenza seasons gives a threshold that can be used to define future seasons. For the Netherlands, this threshold is 51 cases of influenza-like illness cases seen by general practitioners per 100,000 inhabitants. As the Spanish method uses historical data, the threshold can be re-calculated every year. Because the re-calculated thresholds have thus far not deviated much from 51 per 100,000 and for purposes of continuity, the current threshold has been in place since 2007. ",

Even when it is apparent that pneumonia was the cause of death, the pathogen causing the pneumonia often remains unknown. RIVM researcher Liselotte van Asten and colleagues compared the seasonality of mortality in the elderly to seasonality of nine common pathogens. Mortality counts are available as nationwide statistics, while pathogen counts are often only available from a number of laboratories but are considered to represent pathogen circulation in the population. Correlation between the seasonal patterns allows for statistical attribution of mortality to these pathogens. Two to five viruses were estimated to explain on average 4.6% of mortality per season in elderly people, with RSV seasonality explaining almost as much mortality as influenza A. This type of model uses associations between time series, which provide an indication of the role of these pathogens but must not be confused with direct causality. Other pathogens with similar seasonality may have played a role in the disease, and many environmental and behavioral factors show similar seasonal patterns that could also contribute to disease incidence, such as humidity and crowding. In addition, the week in which laboratory detections of a pathogen take place, may not be the same week in which the supposedly affected patients die from the infection. This warrants the used time lags in the models, which may potentially obscure or interfere with associations of mortality with other variables. ",

            "text": "In addition to knowledge about disease occurrence, surveillance data can serve as input for disease burden calculations. The burden of a disease is a combination of its occurrence and its severity: 'how much health is lost' due to this disease? Disease burden can be expressed as several different composite health measures, of which the disability-adjusted life year ('DALY') is most often used. DALYs are also used to assess cost-effectiveness of health interventions: when intervention effects are expressed as the amount of euros needed to prevent one DALY lost, many different types of interventions can be compared, even curative versus preventive. Burden of disease is also sometimes expressed as its monetary cost for society (cost of illness), or as a combination of DALYs and cost of illness. Further explanation of the DALY health measure is given in the State of Infectious Diseases 2013 and in Chapter 5 (41) . The first and largest initiative to estimate disease burden worldwide was the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD), commissioned by the World Bank in the early 1990s. Since that time, the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have facilitated GBD updates every couple of years, and the methodology and conditions studied have steadily developed ever since (42) . GBD studies use the prevalence of a certain condition, i.e. how many people are suffering at this moment, to estimate current burden. The conditions studied are very heterogeneous and can be defined by e.g. a causative pathogen (e.g. malaria), a multifactorial disease (e.g. anemia) or even injuries such as traffic accidents or violence. It has been argued that this approach is not optimal for estimating burden of infectious disease, as many conditions can be (long-term) sequelae of infections but are not attributed to pathogens in the GBD framework. Therefore, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) commissioned the development of a methodology to specifically estimate the burden of infectious disease. This project, called the Burden of Communicable Disease in Europe (BCoDE), was led by the RIVM and resulted in an incidence-based and pathogenbased methodology for DALY calculations (43) . An initial goal of disease burden calculations was \"to decouple epidemiological assessment from advocacy so that estimates of the mortality or disability from a condition are developed as objectively as possible\" (44) . However, measurement of disease burden by DALYs has limitations, and therefore the notion of using DALYs for policy prioritization has also been criticized (45) . Ample debate has surrounded questions on how to establish reliable disease severity measures (disability weights), whether the application of time discounting or age weighting is appropriate, and which life expectancies to apply. DALY calculations also raise ethical issues, as lives of disabled people are valued less. In addition, critics have argued that prioritizing the most cost-effective health interventions may increase inequity among populations, when further improving the health of relatively rich and healthy people would be less expensive than improving the health of people with fewer resources (45) . Furthermore, currently successful prevention strategies, such as immunization programs, drastically reduce disease burden but must continue to receive resources to keep this burden low.",

For both diseases, burden was predicted to increase in the future, however much less so for hepatitis B than for influenza. Patients will live with chronic sequelae of hepatitis B infection for a longer time, due to increasing life expectancy, but this rising contribution to the HBV burden will be offset by the projected decrease in the incidence of new infections. Increasing numbers of susceptible elderly people and their increased life expectancy are also expected to contribute significantly to future influenza burden. Studies like these can inform health policy makers regarding which diseases are expected to cause the most disease burden to society in future years (46).",

Surveillance data can contribute to the identification of where interventions are needed to prevent and control infectious diseases. The most successful example of the use of surveillance data to plan interventions is the eradication of smallpox. During the eradication program, acquiring surveillance data and planning interventions was an important and ongoing process. Weekly case reports were drawn up by health units to identify where interventions were needed. Surveillance teams questioned families and schoolchildren about potential smallpox cases and checked if everyone was vaccinated. By identifying cases, ring vaccination could be carried out resulting in the eradication of smallpox. The planning of interventions for infectious disease control depends on the nature of the infectious disease, the availability of intervention measures, as well as logistic, economic and political constraints (47) . To plan public health interventions, it is important to assess the impact of possible interventions and the allocation of resources. With the arrival of new emerging diseases, public health bodies face questions on how to deploy limited control measures to minimize infectious disease transmission. The general problem is how to choose groups of the population that should receive priority in getting the intervention when resources are limited. Existing approaches to allocating budget to infection control either rely on detailed knowledge of transmission parameters, or on estimates of the eventual number of infections that occur in each group during the entire epidemic (48) . Decisions on how to allocate resources can be made by using different types of mathematical modelling. Economic evaluations in general and cost-effectiveness analyses specifically are prominent tools for evaluating the impact of a specific intervention against a specific disease on the associated costs and effects. The role of cost-effectiveness analyses has become progressively important for decision-making related to assessing (preventive) health interventions, medical technology, and pharmaceuticals (49) . 3-5m 6-11m 1-3y",

The objective of intervention evaluation is to determine as systematically and objectively as possible the relevance, effectiveness, and impact of interventions with respect to their aims. By using the described methods to analyze surveillance data, changes in the surveillance data can be identified which might be attributed to the intervention. The challenge in intervention evaluation is assessing which part of the impact can be attributed to the intervention. One method to assess this is by implementing the intervention as a stepped wedge design. In this design, interventions are rolled-out sequentially over a number of time periods. In the end, all subjects receive the intervention, but the order in which the intervention is received is randomized. The stepped wedge design is particularly useful when it is not feasible to provide the intervention to everyone or every community at once, and for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions that have been shown to be efficacious in a more limited, research setting and that are being scaled up to the community level (52) .",

For example, an outbreak of norovirus infection occurred at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands during the summer of 2004. The Municipal Health Service instructed participants regarding enhanced hygiene measures. Using statistical methods, the reproduction number for every case during the norovirus outbreak was estimated. As the norovirus outbreak spread through the jamboree, the estimated reproduction numbers decreased over time after the implementation of enhanced hygiene measures. This demonstrated the effectiveness of enhanced hygiene measures in containing a norovirus outbreak (53) . The use of surveillance data to measure the effectiveness of interventions is prone to error, as relationships observed for groups do not necessarily hold for individuals. This is known as ecological fallacy. The ecological fallacy may arise when inferences on relationships between causes and outcomes are drawn for units defined at a lower level (such as individuals) based on data collected for units at higher level (such as groups). In other words: relationships observed for groups do not necessarily hold for individuals (54) .",

For clinicians, increased globalization leads to greater diversity in infectious diseases their patients may present with. In addition, aging and medical developments result in changes in populations at risk. A major issue is the threat of antimicrobial resistance.

Big data is a generic term for data sets (such as genomic data) that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. Related to this is the push from governments, also in the Netherlands, towards transparency and data availability in the public domain (https://data.overheid.nl/).

The virological surveillance system lacks background information of the demographic characteristics of the patient, the professional requesting the diagnostic test, the number of tests performed, and the diagnostic testing policy. Only a few laboratories report the weekly or annual number of tests per pathogen, and the type of test most frequently used, probably because data collection and entry is time-consuming, which matches one of the conclusions of the 2001 study. Consequently, it is difficult to assess whether changes in long term trends of reported pathogens are true pathogen-related changes, or the result of alterations in diagnostic testing policy, for instance changes in restitution policy of the Government or medical assurance companies, or the introduction of new diagnostics. The number of reporting laboratories can differ from week to week due to the voluntary basis of the virological surveillance system, thereby complicating the overall interpretation of the data. Furthermore, the set of pathogens for which diagnostic tests are available have increased over time at the individual laboratories, potentially resulting in an increase in the number of diagnostic tests performed. The spread of a pathogen among certain age groups or within particular regions could be investigated if the age of those persons with a positive test result for a specific pathogen, as well as the exact catchment areas of the laboratories were known. Meanwhile, data concerning the request for the diagnostic tests, for instance a request from a GP, a clinical department in a hospital, or the intensive care unit, could give insights into disease severity, and thereby allow a global view of the impact of an infectious disease in the population. . GP surveillance data show no increase in Chlamydia reporting rates (4) . In other countries in Europe, Chlamydia diagnostic rates clearly correlate to testing rates and the implementation of Chlamydia control through opportunistic screening policies (8) . ",

Fifteen years ago, the data in the virological surveillance system appeared to be sufficiently representative for the Netherlands regarding timely reflection of national trends. Currently, a reassessment of the virological weekly reports addressing the limitations concerning the missing background information may lead to improved data interpretation. Furthermore, optimal collaboration between the laboratories and the RIVM, with a minor work load for the laboratories, is likely to ensure the future of the virological weekly reports as a valuable system for the surveillance of infectious diseases. In 2015, noteworthy increases were observed for some pathogens in the virological weekly reports, including several respiratory viruses as well as HEV.

            "text": "Estimates of the burden of infectious diseases can be used to compare health impact between different infectious diseases in the Dutch population and to follow up trends over time. The burden of a disease is a combination of incidence, duration and severity. Disease burden is expressed here in disability-adjusted life years (DALY), which indicates the number of healthy life years lost due to a disease. DALY is a sum of years of life lost due to mortality (YLL) and years lived with disability due to morbidity (YLD) (1) . The YLD is constructed by multiplying the duration of a disease by its disability weight; a measure of severity ranging between 0 (complete health) and 1 (death). The burden of infectious diseases in the Netherlands was estimated using a pathogen-and incidence-based approach (1). This means that all health loss due to an infection is attributed to the event of infection and (future) long-term sequelae of infection are included in the burden assigned to the year of infection. The DALY estimates presented in this chapter can be interpreted as the disease burden that is and will be suffered due to the average annual infections that occurred in the years 2012-2014, or the disease burden that theoretically could have been avoided by preventing infections in those years. We present an update of previous infectious disease burden estimates and include new estimates for psittacosis and Lyme borreliosis (2). The methods are described in the Appendix. While the estimated DALY attributed to influenza is very similar to the estimate for 2007-2011, it is based on a higher incidence, most notably in older age categories. Due to the reduced estimate of duration of uncomplicated influenza episodes from two weeks to five days (Table 5 .1, A.1), this resulted in lower YLD and higher YLL estimates. Other notable differences compared to the 2007-2011 estimates are a much lower burden of Q fever (91 versus 2143) due to reduced incidence, and higher burden estimates resulting from the increased incidence of rubella and measles (due to the 2013-2014 measles outbreak). For norovirus, the estimated incidence was higher, due to an increased incidence of all-cause gastroenteritis hospitalizations in the Netherlands (3). Table 5 .1 presents the total number of DALYs for Lyme borreliosis, of which 6% is attributed to erythema migrans, 8% to disseminated Lyme borreliosis and 86% to persisting symptoms. This reflects the very substantial disease burden due to Lyme-related persisting symptoms (4). ",

In Figure 5 .2, the burden associated with an infection is fully assigned to the age when the infection event occurred. This is most visible in the STI panels showing the high DALY estimate for young women, which is mostly due to tubal infertility resulting from chlamydia. While in the model this burden is assumed equally severe every year from infection until menopausal age, Figure 5 .2 shows this cumulative lifetime burden as a peak at the age of initial infection. Figure 5 .2 further shows a slow but steady increase in national respiratory disease burden with age, while vaccine preventable diseases caused the highest disease burden in school-age children (mainly due to pertussis and the measles outbreak of 2013-2014) and in adults (mainly caused by invasive pneumococcal disease).",

            "text": "An overview of estimated DALY/year versus DALY/100 cases for all included infectious diseases is found in Figure 5 .3. While the DALY/year estimate shows the disease burden at the national level, the DALY/100 cases is indicative of individual burden for the patient. While diseases such as influenza, norovirus infection, pertussis and chlamydia cause a high burden at the national level because of their high incidence, they are relatively mild at the patient level compared to the more severe and less incident rabies, invasive meningococcal disease, or HIV infection. Notable changes were made in the model parameters for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Transition probabilities from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) to ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility were, in the chlamydia model, previously based on estimates of these sequelae after chlamydia infection rather than following PID (5) . In the gonorrhea model, these probabilities were set higher based on other studies, but did not include a measure of uncertainty (2) . In both models, transition factors from PID to tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy including a range of uncertainty are now based on data from Westr\u00f6m et al and are in concordance with other published estimates (6) (7) (8) . Still, much uncertainty remains surrounding the burden of chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. Asymptomatic infections of these STI are common and are at risk for disease sequelae. While this is included in the disease models, incidence of asymptomatic infection is difficult to estimate. Some cases will be diagnosed despite being asymptomatic, for example after being warned by a partner, but the relative proportion of this group is unknown. Moreover, the current disease models do not include an asymptomatic PID state, even though it has been suggested that more than 50% of chlamydia-associated PID do not cause any symptoms but can still lead to further sequelae such as tubal infertility (5). On the other hand, tubal infertility, which accounts for around 80% of both chlamydia and gonorrhea female burden estimates, has been given a high disability weight (0.18). In a more recently published disability weight system, secondary infertility has a much lower disability weight of 0.007 (9) . The burden of tubal infertility is assigned to women only and is assumed to last until menopause. The reality of the experienced burden resulting from infertility is probably much more complex and very heterogeneous.",

For example, substantial disease burden is expected to be caused by infections by streptococcus, cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. In the near future, all disease models will be reviewed again for the Dutch situation with experts. The continuous development of both new and existing disease models, in addition to implementing more uniform disease modeling and disability weighting, is essential to produce more complete, comparable and valid disease burden estimates in the future. b: this number includes asymptomatic (or latent) infections for hepatitis B and C, Q fever, chlamydia, gonorrhea and tuberculosis.

In 2015 and 2014, the number of notifications of chronic HBV per 100 asylum seekers in the age group 5-17 was 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. Compared to 2013, this is a substantial decrease given the number of notifications per 100 asylum seekers in the age group 5-17 was 0.5. Asylum seekers in the Netherlands are not systematically screened for chronic HBV, however general practitioners from the Asylum Seekers Health Centers occasionally offer tests for chronic HBV. Pregnant women are screened for chronic HBV through antenatal screening, which is in place throughout the Netherlands. The incidence of acute HBV infection in the general population in the Netherlands has been declining for more than 10 years, and has been below 1 per 100.000 since 2013. This suggests the increasing influx of refugees from higher prevalence countries is not associated with an increasing transmission of HBV within the Dutch population. In addition, to assess the risk of vaccine preventable disease among asylum seekers, the RIVM initiated a seroprevalence study in 2016. ",

In 2014, 106 malaria cases in asylum seekers were notified, accounting for 37.2% of all malaria cases in the Netherlands (Table 6 .1).

The total number of malaria notifications per 100 asylum seekers staying at COA slightly decreased from 0.5 in 2014 to 0.4 in 2015. This decrease was also observed in the notifications per 100 asylum seekers from Eritrea/Ethiopia, from 3.2 in 2014 to 2.3 in 2015 (Table 6 .6).

The most frequently reported notifiable infectious diseases in asylum seekers in the Netherlands were tuberculosis, chronic hepatitis B and malaria. There is no risk of malaria transmission, as the vector is not present in the Netherlands. There is no evidence of significant transmission of TB and chronic HBV to the Dutch population. ECDC assessed the risk for EU/EEA countries of infectious disease outbreaks as a consequence of the current influx of asylum seekers as being extremely low (4). Even though the large influx in asylum seekers is mainly attributed to the increase of Syrian asylum seekers, most infectious diseases reported in asylum seekers are from people originating in the Horn of Africa. The prevalence of infectious diseases varied according to the country of origin, as well as to the countries visited en route and conditions there. In addition to notifiable infections, there are some indications that the burden of other infections, e.g. scabies, is increased among asylum seekers. The RIVM-CIb in collaboration with NIVEL and others therefore initiated a pilot primary care syndromic surveillance project for infectious diseases among asylum seekers. ",

Despite constant high vaccine coverage, pertussis has resurged in many countries, including the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, pertussis notifications increased suddenly in 1996 and since then have remained at a higher level, with additional peaks every 3-4 years. Despite various changes in the pertussis vaccination schedule as implemented in the period 1996 to 2012, routine surveillance data shows an increase in overall incidence rates of notifications. The measures taken to reduce pertussis burden in the Netherlands reduced infection rates in children eligible for vaccination. However, rates in adolescents and adults steadily increased, while rates in infants not yet (fully) vaccinated remained high and showed an increase in the 2011-2012 epidemic(Figure 3.11) (50). The changes monitored in the surveillance data contributed to the Health Councils advice that vaccination against pertussis should be made available to pregnant women.

The number of infected men with an unknown mode of transmission also declined from about 70 annually in 2004 and 2005, to about 45 annually from 2007 onwards. These results suggest that the Dutch selective vaccination programme for behavioral high-risk groups very likely reduced transmission of HBV in the Netherlands, primarily by reducing the HBV incidence among MSM (55).

Exceptionally low rotavirus incidence in the Netherlands in 2013/14 in the absence of rotavirus vaccination. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(43):pii=20945. The number of reported positive diagnoses of rotavirus was unexpectedly low in the winter of 2013-2014 (figure 4.3). All-cause gastroenteritis (GE) consultations in children aged under 5 from the Dutch sentinel general practice (GP) network as well as data in the virological weekly reports were used to assess whether rotavirus circulation was reduced. A drop of 58% in reported rotavirus diagnoses was observed in the virological weekly reports between August 2013 and July 2014, compared to August 1999 and July 2013 (adjusted for the number of reporting laboratories). Reductions of 75% and 88% were seen in February and March 2014 respectively compared to previous years. However, a peak of reported rotavirus diagnoses was observed in May. The GE consultation rate decreased by 36% in 2013-2014 compared to previous years. Due to the observed rotavirus reduction in both surveillance sources, a surveillance artefact in the virological weekly reports was excluded, and the observation probably reflected reduced rotavirus circulation. Various factors may have been the cause of the decrease, including a mild winter, a low birth rate, rotavirus vaccinations in neighboring countries, and high rotavirus incidence in the previous year. In addition to the research by Hahn\u00e9 et al. (2014), a fairly normal rotavirus season was observed in the virological weekly reports in 2014-2015. Between August 2013 and July 2014, 551 positive diagnoses were reported, whereas 1383 positive diagnoses were reported in the same period in 2014-2015, which is comparable to the incidence in previous years.

However, the number of laboratories reporting HEV diagnoses for at least 1 week increased from 3 in 2008 to 16 in 2015 (figure 4.4). Hence it is likely that the observed increase can partly be attributed to improved diagnostics, potentially influenced by an increased focus on HEV. However, the weekly number of reported positive HEV diagnoses by laboratory also increased. In addition, studies among blood donors show an increase in HEV-IgG seroprevalence in donors aged under 21 between 2000 and 2011(7). This could indicate a true increase in HEV-infections. In addition, in 1 in 1000 blood donors, HEV-RNA was identified in blood. In May 2015, the RIVM started a prospective case-control study assessing the risk factors for acquiring acute HEV-infection.",

One of the remarkable trends in the virological weekly reports has been the steady increase in reported Chlamydia trachomatis (table 4.1). The number of reported positive diagnoses increased from 15,152 in 2008 to 24,504 in 2015. The overall number of laboratories participating in the surveillance system did not increase in this period, whereas the average weekly number of laboratories reporting C. trachomatis fluctuated from 16.2 in 2013 to 18 in 2011. However, the average weekly number of reported positive diagnoses of C. trachomatis per laboratory markedly increased from 17.5 in 2008 to 26.7 in 2015 (figure4.4). Whether this trend indicates a true increase of C. trachomatis in the population or is the result of increased diagnostics or catchment areas of laboratories cannot be assessed from the data in the virological weekly reports. It is likely that it relates to increased numbers of tests requested, due to a higher awareness in the population and among physicians. Some (n=11) of the laboratories participating in the virological weekly reports perform diagnostic tests for detection of sexually transmitted infections (STI) for specific STI clinics. These clinics offer testing free of charge to specific high-risk groups. The number of Chlamydia diagnoses in the STI clinics doubled from 2008 to 2015 (from 9,403 to 17,753).

The majority of these Influenza A diagnoses were reported in the beginning of 2015 (figure 4.2a), corresponding with the exceptionally long duration of the Influenza season in winter 2014-2015 (2). In most laboratories, respiratory panels are available for molecular determination of respiratory pathogens. In these panels, testing is performed on the most frequent causal agents of respiratory infections, such as influenza virus, RS-virus, coronavirus and rhinovirus, using RT-PCR. The relatively high numbers of reported respiratory viruses such as coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 2015, can probably partly be attributed to an increase in conducted respiratory panel-diagnostics due to the intense Influenza season in 2014-2015. A stable increasing trend was observed in the reported rhinovirus diagnoses. The annual number of laboratories reporting rhinovirus diagnoses varied slightly, ranging from 14-18 (average 16). Hence, the increased number of reported positive diagnoses, probably reflects a change in the number of performed diagnostics. In the respiratory season 2011-2012, a lower number of reported positive diagnoses of human respiratory syncytial virus (RS-virus) was observed.

In 2015, 13 patients with hepatitis A infection were reported in patients staying at an asylum seeker center in the Netherlands. This included two family clusters, both with two cases. Hepatitis A strains were identical within the clusters but not between the clusters. All strains were type 1B with most likely area of origin the Middle East. The typing results suggest that transmission occurred during their journey to the Netherlands. The decrease in hepatitis A cases could possibly be explained by the improvement of hygienic measures taken in other countries. Another hypothesis for the decrease in cases is that travelers take better precautions before going abroad (e.g. higher uptake of hepatitis A vaccination).",

Three types of symptomatic infection were defined: nonspecific febrile illness, pneumonia and invasive illness. Proportions of these among all clinical presentations were estimated using random effects meta-analysis for proportions, based on three published studies (4) (5) (6) . Apart from mortality, no long-term sequelae were included. The multiplication factor used on the notified cases of psittacosis was 35.58 (with a Pert distribution between 24.51 and 46.64), based on a meta-analysis estimating the proportion of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations (CAP) caused by C. psittaci, applied to national incidence of CAP in hospitals.
