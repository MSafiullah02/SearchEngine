Collectively, S pneumoniae is the most frequently isolated pathogen. Relative to other pathogens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, and respiratory viruses are also common. The atypical pathogens (with the exception of L pneumophila) are not identified often in clinical practice, however, because there is not a specific, rapid, or standardized test for their detection. Although influenza remains the most predominant viral cause of CAP in adults, other recognized pathogens include respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza virus; and less commonly, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, herpesvirus, varicella, SARS-associated coronavirus, and measles. In a study of nonimmunocompromised adults who were admitted for CAP, 18% of patients had evidence of a viral cause, and in 9% of patients, a respiratory virus was the only pathogen identified [8].",

This type of pneumonia is uncommon, but it is important to recognize because of its potentially serious consequences. CA-MRSA strains seem to be distinct from hospital-acquired strains from epidemiologic, genotypic, and phenotypic perspectives [12]. They tend to be less resistant to antimicrobial drugs than are hospital-acquired MRSA strains and almost always contain a novel-type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) gene. Many of these strains have been found to contain the gene for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, which is responsible for a toxin that is associated with the clinical features of necrotizing pneumonia, shock, and respiratory failure, and the formation of abscess and empyema. Most of the cases published to date have been in children; however, the authors observed this strain in adults during the winter season of 2003 to 2004, and many cases were associated with preceding influenza.",

The clinical relevance of DRSP for pneumonia is imprecise and has been the subject of several reviews [16], [17], [18]. Few well-controlled studies examine the impact of in vitro resistance on clinical outcomes of CAP. Published studies are limited by small sample sizes, biases inherent in observational design, and the relative infrequency of isolates showing high-level resistance among clinical isolates. Most studies suggest that current levels of \u03b2-lactam resistance generally do not result in treatment failures in patients with CAP when appropriate agents (ie, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and doses are used. The available data suggest that the clinically relevant level of penicillin resistance is a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of at least 4 mg/L. One report suggests that if cefuroxime is used to treat pneumococcal bacteremia and if the organism is resistant in vitro, the outcome may be worse than if other therapies are used. Other discordant therapies did not impact mortality [19]. Data suggest that resistance to macrolides and respiratory fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin) may result in clinical failure; however, interpretation is limited by the relatively small number of patients reported [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25].",

Although the relative predictive value of these risk factors is unclear, treatment with antimicrobial drugs is likely to be the most significant factor. Several sets of data have shown that recent therapy with \u03b2-lactams, macrolides or quinolones is a risk factor for pneumococcal resistance to the same class of antibiotic, and repeated courses of the same antibiotic class are a risk factor for pneumococcal resistance to that agent [27], [28], [29], [30]. One study has found that in the presence of pneumococcal bacteremia, use of a \u03b2-lactam or macrolide within the past 6 months increased the likelihood of infection with a penicillin-resistant organism [30]. In that study, recent use of a quinolone did not predict an increased likelihood of penicillin resistance, but other studies have shown that repeated use of quinolones does predict an increased risk for quinolone-resistant pneumococci [25], [29]. It remains uncertain if this risk applies equally to all quinolones or if it is more of a concern for less active pneumococcal agents (levofloxacin) than for more active agents (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin) [23], [24], [25].",

In general, the NA guidelines recommend a macrolide as first-line treatment for outpatients with no comorbidity or risk factors for DRSP. The rationale is that macrolides provide effective therapy for the most common bacterial pathogens in such patients (ie, primarily S pneumoniae) and the atypical organisms, especially M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae, which are common in outpatients. The positioning of the macrolides as prominent first-line agents in the NA guidelines partially is based on the presumption that the new macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) can be effective against MRSP strains, in which lower-level resistance results from increased drug efflux and resulting MICs that often are less than 8 \u03bcg/mL. Because data indicate that mef-mediated resistance is becoming associated with higher MICs (from a median of 4 \u03bcg/mL to a median of 8 \u03bcg/mL), it is reasonable to consider an alternative therapy (ie, respiratory fluoroquinolone, ketolide, or high-dose amoxicillin [\u22653 g/d for adults] plus a macrolide) if risk factors for DRSP are present.",

The rationale is that these agents are effective against S pneumoniae and, when given in high doses, are even effective for most strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin. Because most of the macrolide resistance in Europe is erm-mediated, high-level resistance, the macrolides are not regarded as optimal first-line empirical agents to treat this pathogen if S pneumoniae infection is considered likely. The British guidelines place less significance in the need to treat empirically patients who are infected with atypical pathogens and are ambulatory (mild disease). The guidelines suggest that because M pneumoniae exhibits epidemic periodicity every 4 to 5 years and largely affects younger patients, a policy for initial empirical therapy that aims always to cover this pathogen is unnecessary.",

Although limited by their retrospective design, these studies have found that the use of macrolides as part of an initial combination therapy (usually with a cephalosporin agent) or fluoroquinolone monotherapy in patients who require hospitalization seems to be associated with decreased mortality rates or shorter hospital stays, compared with the use of a cephalosporin alone [37], [38], [39], [40]. The specific cause of infection was not determined in these studies; however, the added coverage for atypical pathogens partly may explain this observation. The recommendations in the BTS guidelines are similar to in the NA guidelines. The Japanese guidelines stratify patients based on age and presence of underlying illness, and use of an \u201cinjection use fluoroquinolone\u201d is recommended for younger patients with less serious disease.

For such patients, recommended empiric therapeutic options include a respiratory fluoroquinolone (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), a ketolide alone (ie, telithromycin) if enteric gram-negative bacteria are not a concern, or combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide (with doxycycline as alternative) is effective for S pneumoniae infection. These regimens may be appropriate for use in patients who are without comorbidities or recent antimicrobial and who live in places where there is a high prevalence of S pneumoniae infection with high-level macrolide resistance. Based on pharmacodynamic principles, high-dosage amoxicillin (1 g of amoxicillin three times daily or 2 g of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate two times daily) should be effective for more than 93% of cases of S pneumoniae infection, and amoxicillin is the preferred \u03b2-lactam [53]. For patients without type I penicillin allergy [53], a selected cephalosporin (cefpodoxime, cefuroxime) can be used as an alternative, but these drugs are less active in vitro than is high-dose amoxicillin.",

In vitro, telithromycin is active against S pneumoniae which is resistant to other antimicrobials, including penicillin, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. Data from several controlled, double-blind CAP trials suggest that telithromycin is as effective as the comparators, including amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and trovafloxacin [56], [57], [58]. Available information suggests that telithromycin, which is only available as an oral agent, will have an important role in the treatment of CAP caused S pneumoniae or the common atypical pathogens.

Numerous studies have shown that empiric treatment with either of these regimens is associated with a significant reduction in mortality rate and length of hospital stay, compared with treatment with cephalosporin alone [38], [39], [40]. The preferred \u03b2-lactams are effective in treating S pneumoniae infection and are not overly broad spectrum; however, treatment with other antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal agents (eg, cefepime, piperacillin, tazobactam) can be appropriate when more resistant pathogens are involved in the pneumonia or coexisting infections. In January 2002, the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) increased the MIC breakpoints for cefotaxime and ceftriaxone treatment of nonmeningeal S pneumoniae infections. These new breakpoints acknowledge that nonmeningeal infections caused by strains that formerly were considered to be intermediately susceptible, and even some strains that were regarded as resistant, can be treated successfully with the usual doses of these \u03b2-lactams. Ertapenem is included as a \u03b2-lactam option in light of two randomized, double-blind studies showing that such treatment has equivalent results compared with the results of ceftriaxone therapy [60], [61]. This drug also has excellent activity for anaerobic organisms and most Enterobacteriaceae (including producers of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producers, but not P aeruginosa). It may be useful in patients with risks for these pathogens, particularly in elderly patients who are admitted from nursing homes and patients who have recently received antibiotic therapy. Clinical experience with ertapenem is limited, however. Doxycycline can be used as an alternative to a macrolide, based on minimal-to-moderate experience for treatment of Legionella infections [62].",

Data from two randomized, double-blind studies of adults hospitalized for CAP have demonstrated that parenteral azithromycin monotherapy was as effective as intravenous cefuroxime therapy with or without intravenous erythromycin (the azalide monotherapy regimen had greater tolerability) [63], [64]. Feldman et al [65] reviewed the records of patients with CAP who were admitted to a Veterans Affairs facility between December 1997 and July 2001 and compared the outcomes of patients who received azithromycin monotherapy with the outcomes of patients who received ATS-recommended antibiotics or non\u2013ATS-recommended antibiotics. Outcomes included time to stability, length of stay (LOS), and mortality and were adjusted for severity of illness (mean PSI score: 89.2 for azithromycin group versus 95.0 for the ATS groups; P\n = 0.07) and processes of care. Patients requiring ICU management were excluded. Mortality and re-admission rates were similar among the groups, but mean LOS was shorter in the azithromycin group. None of the 10 patients with erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae infections died or was transferred to the ICU, including the six patients who received azithromycin. In a retrospective analysis of the impact of initial antibiotic choice on 30-day mortality rates in patients admitted to the hospital for CAP, Brown et al [66] observed that patients who received monotherapy with macrolides had the lowest mortality rate, but were the least ill. Such patients were younger and were more likely to be in low-risk groups.",

The combination of a potent antipneumococcal \u03b2-lactam and an advanced macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone should provide an effective spectrum for such patients. The role of monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone is not yet established for severe CAP, and if the patient has pneumococcal meningitis, the efficacy of quinolone monotherapy is uncertain. If risk factors for Pseudomonas infection are present (or if other infection sites coexist in which Pseudomonas spp or more resistant pathogens are considerations), therapy should include agents that are effective against pneumococcus, Pseudomonas spp, and Legionella spp. Piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime are the preferred \u03b2-lactams when there is concern for unusual pathogens, such as P aeruginosa or other gram-negative bacteria.",

In one retrospective study of hospitalized adults with influenza, a minority of whom had radiographically documented pneumonia, no obvious benefit of amantadine treatment was found [71]; however, because such patients often have recoverable virus after hospitalization (median duration, 4 days), antiviral treatment seems reasonable.

If an appropriate culture reveals the isolation of penicillin-susceptible S pneumoniae, therapy can be specified by selecting a narrow-spectrum agent, such as penicillin or amoxicillin. It is hoped that this approach reduces the selective pressure for resistance. This information is often available for consideration if the patient is switched from parenteral to oral therapy and may be used to direct specific antimicrobial choices.",

It is uncertain what the impact of these findings is on the principle of narrowing the regimen to effective monotherapy once the results of susceptibilities are known [72], [73], [74]. The results of these studies have led to the suggestion that these observations might result from the presence of unknown coinfection with an atypical pathogen. An alternative explanation is the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. These studies have significant design limitations, as they are not prospective or randomized. They evaluated the effects of initial empiric therapy before the results of blood cultures were known and did not examine the effects of pathogen-specific therapy after the results of blood cultures were available.",

Most CA-MRSA strains reportedly have been associated with skin infections, but they also have been associated with pneumonia (primarily in children, although the authors have observed such cases in adults during the winter of 2003 to 2004). In general, these strains are more susceptible in vitro to non\u2013\u03b2-lactam antimicrobial drugs than are hospital-acquired strains. They are often susceptible in vitro to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and to the fluoroquinolones, although pockets of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains exist. They are often susceptible to clindamycin, but the emergence of resistance during therapy has been reported (especially in erythromycin-resistant strains). There is insufficient data on the use of these agents to treat adults with CA-MRSA pneumonia. Until such data become available, the authors recommend vancomycin or linezolid for initial therapy of such patients.",

Duration is difficult to define in a uniform fashion, because some antibiotics are administered for a short time, but have a long half-life at respiratory sites of infection (eg, azithromycin). Most patients become clinically stable within 3 to 7 days, so longer durations of therapy are rarely necessary; however, patients with persistent clinical instability are often readmitted to the hospital and may not be candidates for short-term therapy. Short-term therapy may not be optimal for patients with bacteremic S aureus pneumonia because of the risks for associated endocarditis and deep-seated infection; patients with meningitis-complicating pneumonia; patients with P aeruginosa pneumonia, which is often a necrotizing pneumonia; and patients with infection caused by other less common pathogens. In one study, 8-day therapy of nosocomial pneumonia with P aeruginosa led to relapse more commonly than did 15-day therapy [75]. Studies that defined the duration of therapy focused on patients receiving accurate empiric therapy, and no data exist that well define the duration of treatment in patients who initially received an ineffective therapy regimen.",

Some reports used one-dose therapy for patients with atypical pathogen infection [44], [63], [64], [76]. The ketolide telithromycin has been used for 5 to 7 days to treat outpatients, including some patients with pneumococcal bacteremia or PSI classes of at least III [77]. The antipneumococcal quinolones have been used for 7 to 14 days in inpatients and outpatients, but most patients have a good clinical response within 2 to 3 days. Two studies of quinolones have shown that using quinolone doses that result in high antipneumococcal activity can lead to a rapid clinical response. In one study, more recipients of 750-mg levofloxacin than recipients of 500-mg levofloxacin became afebrile by day 3 (49.1% versus 38.5%; P\n = 0.03). In that study, the 750-mg dose was successful after only 5 days of therapy [78]. In another study, 58.9% of patients receiving 400 mg of moxifloxacin became afebrile by day 2 (this rate was higher than that for the comparator agent in the study), and 50% of these patients were switched to oral therapy by day 3 [79].",
