In addition to improved documentation, earlier and increased use of EE is the primary long term effect. The calorie needs of the ICP are still not adequately covered. This show that the ICP still are suffering from malnutrition. This presents both challanges and improvement potential. Main challanges: 1) Adequate nutrition supply. More combination of EE and PE should be concidered in order to meet the needs of the patient. 2) Achiving optimum start of administering (within the first 24-48 hours) and more extensive use of EE. 3) Maintaining focus on and interest for clinical nutrition in the ICU. 4) Regard quality improvement of nutrition for the ICP as a contiuous process.",

Nevertheless, further unraveling of particular cytokine profiles, monocyte function and specific bone formation and resorption indices in these patients are required to deduce the value of intravenous 25(OH)D supplementation in prolonged critically ill patients. INTRODUCTION. Obesity has been described as an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in critically ill patients, with conflicting results. Recently, lower body mass index (BMI) has been associated with higher odds of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) population. The objective of this study is to determine the influence of BMI on ICU mortality, ICU length of stay (LOS) and nursing resource utilization.",

Assuming each patient had at least one unscheduled dressing change per day for half of their stay, the average costs were $1390.00 and $5497.00 in the BMS and control groups respectively. Sensitivity analyses determined that in order for the BMS to lose this dominance, the infection rates would have to be equal, and the cost of an unscheduled dressing change less than $6.10.",

This is the only follow-up study designed to specifically assess whether TRF during PDT is associated with an increased risk of tracheal stenosis. Previous studies have identified TRF as a common complication of the percutwist technique 1 , as well as tracheal stenosis following poor placement of the tracheostomy 2 .

In 11 out of 20 cases (55%) the fenestration was not seen in the trachea and for another 6 patients only one hole was seen in the trachea. Only in one patient (5%) were all 7 holes of the fenestration within the tracheal lumen (table 1). The TT cuff was visible in all cases. The posterior part of the TT was visible in 18 of 21 cases (86%). In 3 cases only the cuff was seen within the trachea. In 5 cases, a severe deformation of the trachea was seen, with a significantly decreased anterior-posterior diameter. In 2 cases, the position of the FTTT was considered to be inappropriate and was changed for a Smiths Adjustable Flange Tracheostomy Tube. In 2 cases, air bubbles could be seen emerging from the fenestration holes, despite the presence of a non-fenestrated inner cannula. One patient sustained a fractured tracheal cartilage and another patient's procedure was complicated by surgical emphysema. CONCLUSION. We suggest that when a fenestrated TT is used, its position should be visualized using a bronchoscope. This may lead to a clinical decision to change the type of TT used. Further studies are required to assess the impact of the position of the fenestration of the TT on the weaning of the patient and whether the position of the fenestration alters with time.",

Twenty-two cases of MRSA were detected in ICU (15 acquired and 7 imported). The sites of infection were the respiratory tract (54.8%), operative wounds (22.6%), bacteriemic infections (9.6%), catheter sepsis (3.2%), soft tissue (6.4%) and others (3.4%). During the same period, the ESS detected 2 colonized patients, 2 nurses of ICU colonized and 5 imported colonized patients (4 from general wards and 1 from residential care facility).",

Mean leptin value on day 1 was 2.44 pmol (SD: 5.845), and on day 16 mean leptin value was 1.477 pmol (SD: 1.240). T-test for paired samples gave statistic difference in 95% confidence interval with (2-tail significance: 0.029) on leptin value between day 1 and 16. CONCLUSION.

Evaluate the correlation between pair of variables obtained with Biespectral Index (BIS) and continuous electroencephalogram (EEGc) in barbiturate coma monitoring. METHODS. Burst Suppression Ratio (BSR), in the EEGc (EEG INFINITY POD-SIEMENS), BIS value and BIS Suppression Ratio (SR) (BIS XP-ASPECT) was obtained in 172 simultaneous measures made in four patients. An statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the linear relationship between pairs of variables: SR-BSR and BIS value-BSR with Pearson's correlation coefficient dispersion graphs. RESULTS. 144 pairs of BSR-SR and 145 pairs of BIS value-SR were evaluated. 27 (15.7%) measures were excluded, 10 because of technical problems (poor BIS signal's transmission and disadjustment of the EEGc electrodes) and 17 because of EEG low voltage on EEGc tracing. BSR-SR: Pearson correlation coefficient: +0.318 (p<0.001) BSR-BIS value: Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.242 (p=0.003) Correlation Graphs will be presented. CONCLUSION. Although studied variables try to measure the same concept, in our sample we could not demonstrate a liner relationship between BSR-TS and BIS value-BSR. BIS signal transmission, electrodes adjustment on EEG-conv and other monitoring problems should be avoided for a correct interpretation. REFERENCE(S). 1.

The use of non invasive ventilation (NIV) is controversial in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and do not intubate order (DNI). Despite this, different observational studies find a high success rate with NIV in these patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate NIV effectiveness by analysing hospital mortality and one year survival.METHODS.Prospective observational study including all the patients staying at the ICU from January 1997 to December 2004 with ARF diagnose and NIV required. The indication for NIV was dyspnea, respiratory rate > 30, PaO2/FiO2 < 200, pHa < 7.35 or respiratory accessory muscular activity. The variables are expressed as mean + standard deviation or as percentages. The comparison between the variables was made with Ji2 and Student T test. The survival analysis after one year was done by means of log rank test. The variables associated to mortality were analyzed by multivariate analysis.RESULTS.During the period of the study, 1598 patients were admitted, of whom 429 (26.8%) showed DNI. The most frequent DNI causes were respiratory disease (56.4%) and advanced cardiac failure (17.9%). The mode of ventilation was BiPAP for 96.8% of the patients. DNI was more frequent in women than in men (31% vs 24%; p: 0.003). Patients with DNI were older (74\u00b112 vs 67\u00b114 years; p<0.001) and with a higher severity score (SAPSII: 49\u00b115 vs 42\u00b113; p<0.001). PaCO2 (66\u00b125 vs 61\u00b124; p<0.001) and pHa (7.27\u00b10.11 vs 7.29\u00b10.11; p.0.003) levels were different among the patients at NIV start but neither were the ratio PaO2/FiO2 (153\u00b137 vs 152\u00b142; p:0.699) nor respiratory rate (33.9\u00b17.1 vs 33.8\u00b17.1; p:0.834). NIV duration was higher DNI patients (43.7\u00b135.8 vs 29.1\u00b128.3 hours; p<0.001). Hospital mortality was 57.1% for DNI and 19.0% for those whish did not have DNI (p<0.001). Variables associated to hospital rate were: SAPS II (OR:1.02; 95% CI:1.OR:1.37, 95% CI:1.15 to 1.62, p<0.001). One year mortality was 68.5% with survival mean of 143 days in the DNI group and 25.0% with survival mean of 289 days (p<0.0001) in not DNI group.CONCLUSION. DNI order presence is a determining factor for poor prognosis in ARF patients. Despite this, NIV effectiveness rate is high and its use with this kind of patients could be considered.NONINVASIVE VENTILATION IN ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE SECONDARY TO SEVERE PNEUMONIACarrillo A 1 , Martinez M 1 , L\u00f3pez A 1 , Soler J 1 , Botias S 1 , Renedo A 1 , Parraga M 1 , Mill\u00e1n M 1 , Gonz\u00e1lez G 1 1 ICU, Hospital Morales Meseguer, Murcia, SpainINTRODUCTION.Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has demonstrated to be useful, to reduce the need for intubation and mortality in COPD patients with acute exacerbation.

The targets in the Surviving Sepsis resuscitation 6-hour care bundle were the benchmarks for good practice.RESULTS. 202 patients (median age 71yrs, interquartile range 53-82yrs, 114 female) were audited. 102 (51%, median age 75yrs, interquartile range 60-84yrs, 58 female) patients had evidence of an acute infection. Of the infected patients, 5 had a systolic BP</=90mmHg, 8 a MAP</=65mmHg and 69 had 2 or more SIRS criteria. In all patients (n=72 data available), 32% received antibiotics within 3hrs of arriving at hospital (median 3hrs 52 mins, interquartile range 2hrs 22mins-6hrs 58mins). For patients with 2 or more SIRS criteria (n=50 data available), 42% received antibiotics within 3hrs of arriving at hospital (median 3hrs 14mins, interquartile range 2hrs 2mins-3hrs 14mins). In all patients (n=45 data available), 36% had a blood culture taken within an hour of arriving at hospital (median 1hr 42mins, interquartile range 50mins-1hr 42 mins). In 3 patients, blood cultures were taken after antibiotics were given. In patients with MAP</=65mmHg, fluid was initially run at 20ml/kg in only one patient and a lactate was measured in only one patient. Only one patient had a CVP line inserted.CONCLUSION. 51% of patients on our MAU have an infection. The majority are elderly with significant physiological derangement when judged by SIRS criteria. There is a significant delay in the administration of antibiotics, even in those patients who are physiologically most unstable. This data support the view that a systematic approach to identify and treat septic patients on MAU is needed. ",

Important part of the pathophysiology of sepsis is caused by inappropriate coagulation in the microcirculation. It is known, that haemodilution causes enhancement of coagulation owing to imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. HES are often used for correction of hypovolaemia in pts with sepsis. The aim of this study was investigation of the effects of infusions of HES on the hemostasis in septic pts.METHODS. 20 pts received HES 130/04 (Voluven, Fresenius-Kabi) 13.7 \u00b1 1.5 ml/kg within 2-3 hours. During infusion of HES all other infusions were stopped. Before and after infusions we measured in plasma activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) prothrombin index (PI), activities of antithrombin III (AT III), factor VIII (FVIII), protein C (PC), plasminogen (PG), Willebrand factor (FW), levels of fibrinogen and soluble fibrin monomer complexes (SFMC).",

            "text": "Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic spore forming bacterium. Spores contaminate wounds, germinate and produce neurotoxin. Seven neurotoxins A-G have been identified, which bind to the presynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction, blocking the release of acetylcholine and resulting in a descending flaccid paralysis. Neurotoxin has a high affinity for the receptors causing slow recovery which begins only when new receptors have formed. Soft tissue infections caused by spore-forming bacteria have emerged as a serious problem in intravenous drug users (IDUs). Higher purity heroin permits IDUs who have lost access to veins to use subcutaneous or intramuscular routes, so-called 'skin-popping' and 'muscle-popping'. Use of large amounts of citric acid as a solvent for the heroin or drug contamination may increase tissue damage at the injection site. An anaerobic environment facilitates the germination of C. botulinum.",

The assessment of sedation level remains a challenge for the intensivist in order to avoid over-or under-sedation phenomena.

According to the repports, the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) has been shown to be highly reliable among multiple types of healt care professionals. The RASS has an expanded set of scores at pivotal levels of sedation that are determinated by patients' response to verbal vs physical stimulation, which will help the clinician in titrating medication.METHODS. This is a prospective, nonramdomized, observational study in a surgical and trauma tertiary intensive care of an universitary hospital. Twenty-six consecutive neurosurgical postoperative patients (age range 17-68 yrs, mean age 44 yrs) were included. They were sedated (with propofol by continuos infusion at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/h, which could be modulated with steps of 0.5 mg/kg/h), in order to mantein an adecuated RASS score. BIS value was continuosly recorded, and manually calculated on a mean average of a minute during the measuring of RASS score, and every 10 minutes for 6 hours on par with RASS score.

The mean age was 49 years and the mean duration of ICU stay was 4.5 days. The overall mortality was 12.2%. The Euroscore (standard and logistic) did not predict outcome and was similar for CABG surgery survivors and nonsurvivors. Preoperative insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump and preoperative cardiac failure were associated with a significant increase in mortality (p<0.05). The intraoperative bypass time was significantly longer in nonsurvivors compared to survivors (p=0.01). Postoperatively, major haemorrhage (>1litre), nosocomial sepsis, extubation failure and organ failure were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared to survivors (p<0.05). These observations pertain to the entire cohort.CONCLUSION. The Euroscore is a poor predictor of outcome in our patients. The risk factors identified in this analysis need prospective validation.",
