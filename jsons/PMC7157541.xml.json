They have four main subgroups\u2014alpha, beta, gamma, and delta\u2014based on their genomic structure. Alpha- and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals, usually causing respiratory symptoms in humans and gastroenteritis in other animals [2,3]. Until December of 2019, only six different coronaviruses were known to infect humans. Four of these (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) usually caused mild common cold-type symptoms in immunocompetent people and the other two have caused pandemics in the past two decades. In 2002\u20132003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a SARS epidemic that resulted in a 10% mortality. Similarly, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused a devastating pandemic in 2012 with a 37% mortality rate.",

When the genomics of the 2019-nCov was sequenced, it shared 79.5% of the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV that caused the 2002\u20132003 pandemic [4] and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed the 2019-nCov as SARS-CoV-2 [5]. Patients began to present in November and December with various degrees of respiratory distress of unknown etiology and treated at the time as possible influenza infections. As it became apparent that most cases had a shared history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (the so-called \u201cwet market\u201d), the Wuhan local health authority issued an epidemiologic alert on 30 December 2019 and the wet market was closed. About a week later, on 9 January 2020, Chinese researchers shared the full genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2 [6]. Since the novel coronavirus was recognized, the disease it caused was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19), and several reports on the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and treatment strategies have been published [7,8,9,10]. In addition, several websites have been setup to track the epidemic and the case detection rate, which are being updated as often as hourly [11,12,13,14]. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global public health emergency, sixth after H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016) and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019), and on 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic [15]. The timeline of events is summarized in Figure 1.",

This RBD binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor found in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract [18] thus facilitating viral entry into target cells. Based on genomic sequencing, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a mutated version of its most closely related virus, RaTG13, sampled from bats (Rhinolophus affinis) [19]. It is, therefore, believed that the SARS-CoV-2 also originated from bats and, after mutating, was able to infect other animals. The mutation increased the RBD affinity to ACE-2 in humans, but also other animals such as ferrets and Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica; a long-snouted, ant-eating mammal sold illegally for use in traditional Chinese medicine), but also decreased the RBD affinity to ACE-2 found in rodents and civets. The pangolin is believed to be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 [17].",

Binding of the SARS-CoV to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors in the type II pneumocytes in the lungs triggers a cascade of inflammation in the lower respiratory tract [20]. It has been demonstrated that when the SARS spike protein binds to the ACE-2 receptor (Figure 3A), the complex is proteolytically processed by type 2 transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 leading to cleavage of ACE-2 and activation of the spike protein (Figure 3B) [21,22], similar to the mechanism employed by influenza and human metapneumovirus, thus facilitating viral entry into the target cell (Figure 3C). It has been suggested that cells in which ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 are simultaneously present are most susceptible to entry by SARS-CoV [23]. Early indications are that SARS-CoV-2 virus also requires ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 to enter cells [24].",

However, those admitted may have had less severe symptoms for 2 to 14 days prior to presentation, during which they were likely contagious. By the time patients developed shortness of breath, they had been sick for an average of eight days. Once admitted to the hospital, all patients developed clinical pneumonia supported by chest CT findings, and 13 of the 41 patients (32%) developed hypoxic respiratory failure necessitating ICU admission. Four patients (10%) required mechanical ventilation, two of which received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to refractory hypoxia. In total, six patients died, giving a case fatality rate (CFR) of 15% and triggering panic that quickly spread worldwide. While early media reports suggested that deaths were more likely in patients with comorbid conditions, of the 41 patients described in the Chinese review, only 38% had comorbid conditions and the average age was 49.",

For the purposes of comparison, the mean R0 for seasonal influenza is between 1.1 and 2.3 (variable by region and immunization rates), whereas for SARS was between 1 and 2.75. The slightly higher R0 for SARS-CoV-2 may be because it has a longer prodromal period, increasing the period during which the infected host is contagious. ",

Droplet transmission is typically limited to short distances, generally less than 2 m. However, the airborne route involves much smaller droplets that can float and move longer distances with air currents. Under certain humidity and temperature environments, airborne droplets can remain in flight for hours. Generally, pathogens that are transmissible via the airborne route have higher R0, because infected particles can remain in the air long after the infected individual has left the premises. This airborne route occurs, for example, in measles (R0 between 12 and 18 [34]) and chicken pox (R0s between 3.7 and 5.0 [35]). ",

The total number of those infected includes those who were infected and recovered without presentation (Ir), infected and presented to a health care facility (Ip), and infected and died (Id). The CFR would be M/(Ir + Ip + Id). Clearly, one must have an accurate estimation of each of these parameters to accurately determine the CFR of COVID-19. While the (M) is generally easier to count, and a focus of media, the denominator can take much longer to calculate. During the early phases of a deadly epidemic, the number of those who were infected and recovered (Ir) is not yet known, since only those who were infected and became seriously ill are recognized and tested. In addition, because this is a novel virus, there were no existing detection methods, so early deaths due to clinical entities such as influenza, for example, may have been mis-attributed to CoVID-19. The viral genome was published about 2 weeks after the start of the outbreak, and PCR analysis was quickly used to diagnose suspected cases [6]. Public health officials can now test suspected cases, especially close contacts of known cases, and others with mild symptoms, but the testing capabilities can become saturated, potentially limiting the ability to get an accurate estimation of Ip. For example, the initial ability of the Wuhan health authority was limited to 200 tests per day, but that number has grown to 4196 tests per day [44]. The combination of these factors leads to a gross underestimation of the denominator of the CFR calculation, and thus an exaggeration of the mortality. Until we are able to accurately represent Ir and Ip, it is currently impossible to precisely estimate the CFR of SARS-CoV-2. ",

While it is tempting to estimate the CFR by dividing the number of known deaths by the total number of confirmed cases, the resulting number may be off by orders of magnitude, especially since infected individuals at one point in time may die x days later. Using the lag period approach and dividing the current number of deaths to the number of cases x days ago may be a more acute estimator of CFR. Nucleuswealth.com applied this method by using the number of deaths at any particular day and dividing by number of cases 4, 8, or 12 days prior. As seen in Figure 4, as time progresses, whether whichever number of days is used for x, the CFR seems to converge at just under 5% for cases within Hubei, and about 0.8% for cases outside of Hubei [14]. The higher mortality in Wuhan may be overestimated because early in the course of this epidemic, viral testing was limited to only the severe cases. However, the China National Health Commission admits that Wuhan has a relative lack of medical resources, which may have contributed to the higher mortality rate.",

However, the sample size contained only eight different individuals (five African Americans, two whites, and one Asian) and extrapolating those findings to a whole race is impractical. Yet, in another study assessing ACE-2 receptor expression in tissues of 224 patients with lung cancer, there were no significant disparities in ACE-2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs. Caucasian), age groups (older or younger than 60 years old), or gender groups (male vs. females) [49]. ACE-2 gene expression was, however, significantly elevated in smokers suggesting that smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible populations. Since smoking in China is predominantly a male attribute (54% of men, 2.6% of women) [50], this may help to explain the gender difference seen in the hospitals in China.",

The first strategy would be to employ either a small receptor-binding domain (RBD) or a neutralizing antibody targeting the ACE-2 receptor, thus blocking the binding of S protein and preventing virus entry into cells. Initial in vitro results have shown promising results [67,68] and specific monoclonal antibodies are being contemplated as candidates for treatment [69,70]. The main limitation of using RBDs or antibodies is that the treatment must be given within a specific time window, before the initiation of viral replication [20]. In addition, the side effects of ACE-2 blockade, especially since ACE-2 is also present in non-pulmonary tissue, must be understood and minimized before implementation. In addition, finally, the turnover of ACE-2 receptors would influence how often the therapeutic RBD or antibody would have to be administered. ",

In addition, the recent mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may pave the way for more rapid development of a specific vaccine [76]. Of interest is the use of a relatively new vaccine technology, RNA vaccines that have the ability to elicit potent immune responses against infectious diseases and certain cancers [77,78]. Traditional vaccines stimulate the production of antibodies via challenges with purified proteins from the pathogens, or by using whole cells (live, attenuated vaccines). While very effective, the creation of new vaccines can take years. Alternatively, RNA-based vaccines use mRNA that upon entering cells, are translated to antigenic molecules that in turn, stimulate the immune system. This process has been used effectively against some cancers [79,80], and clinical trials are underway for several other cancers [81]. In addition, the production of RNA-based vaccines is more rapid and less expensive than traditional vaccines, which can be a major advantage in pandemic situations. Clinical trials for an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are currently underway [82]. Study subjects will receive the mRNA vaccine in two doses, 28 days apart and the safety and immunogenicity will be assessed.",
