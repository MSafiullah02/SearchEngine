The replicase gene encoding the non-structural proteins (nsps) occupies two-thirds of the genome, about 20 kb, as opposed to the structural and accessory proteins, which make up only about 10 kb of the viral genome. The 5\u2032 end of the genome contains a leader sequence and untranslated region (UTR) that contains multiple stem loop structures required for RNA replication and transcription. Additionally, at the beginning of each structural or accessory gene are transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs) that are required for expression of each of these genes (see Subheading 4.3 on RNA replication). The 3\u2032 UTR also contains RNA structures required for replication and synthesis of viral RNA. The organization of the coronavirus genome is 5\u2032-leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)-E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-3\u2032 UTR-poly (A) tail with accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3\u2032 end of the genome (Fig. 1). The accessory proteins are almost exclusively nonessential for replication in tissue culture; however, some have been shown to have important roles in viral pathogenesis [1].\n",

Homotrimers of the virus encoded S protein make up the distinctive spike structure on the surface of the virus [4, 5]. The trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein [6] and mediates attachment to the host receptor [7]. In most, coronaviruses, S is cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into two separate polypeptides noted S1 and S2 [8, 9]. S1 makes up the large receptor-binding domain of the S protein, while S2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule [10].",

The E protein has an N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal endodomain and has ion channel activity. As opposed to other structural proteins, recombinant viruses lacking the E protein are not always lethal, although this is virus type dependent [15]. The E protein facilitates assembly and release of the virus (see Subheading 4.4), but also has other functions.

It is composed of two separate domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), both capable of binding RNA in vitro, but each domain uses different mechanisms to bind RNA. It has been suggested that optimal RNA binding requires contributions from both domains [17, 18]. N protein is also heavily phosphorylated [19], and phosphorylation has been suggested to trigger a structural change enhancing the affinity for viral versus nonviral RNA. N protein binds the viral genome in a beads-on-a-string type conformation. Two specific RNA substrates have been identified for N protein; the TRSs [20] and the genomic packaging signal [21]. The genomic packaging signal has been found to bind specifically to the second, or C-terminal RNA binding domain [22]. N protein also binds nsp3 [18, 23], a key component of the replicase complex, and the M protein [24]. These protein interactions likely help tether the viral genome to the replicase\u2013transcriptase complex (RTC), and subsequently package the encapsidated genome into viral particles.",

The S-protein\u2013receptor interaction is the primary determinant for a coronavirus to infect a host species and also governs the tissue tropism of the virus. Many coronaviruses utilize peptidases as their cellular receptor. It is unclear why peptidases are used, as entry occurs even in the absence of the enzymatic domain of these proteins. Many \u03b1-coronaviruses utilize aminopeptidase N (APN) as their receptor, SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor, MHV enters through CEACAM1, and the recently identified MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) to gain entry into human cells (see Table 1 for a list of known CoV receptors).\n",

This is generally accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of S protein by a cathepsin, TMPRRS2 or another protease, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. S protein cleavage occurs at two sites within the S2 portion of the protein, with the first cleavage important for separating the RBD and fusion domains of the S protein [31] and the second for exposing the fusion peptide (cleavage at S2\u2032). Fusion generally occurs within acidified endosomes, but some coronaviruses, such as MHV, can fuse at the plasma membrane. Cleavage at S2\u2032 exposes a fusion peptide that inserts into the membrane, which is followed by joining of two heptad repeats in S2 forming an antiparallel six-helix bundle [6]. The formation of this bundle allows for the mixing of viral and cellular membranes, resulting in fusion and ultimately release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm.",

The replicase gene encodes two large ORFs, rep1a and rep1b, which express two co-terminal polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Fig. 1). In order to express both polyproteins, the virus utilizes a slippery sequence (5\u2032-UUUAAAC-3\u2032) and an RNA pseudoknot that cause ribosomal frameshifting from the rep1a reading frame into the rep1b ORF. In most cases, the ribosome unwinds the pseudoknot structure, and continues translation until it encounters the rep1a stop codon. Occasionally the pseudoknot blocks the ribosome from continuing elongation, causing it to pause on the slippery sequence, changing the reading frame by moving back one nucleotide, a -1 frameshift, before the ribosome is able to melt the pseudoknot structure and extend translation into rep1b, resulting in the translation of pp1ab [32, 33]. In vitro studies predict the incidence of ribosomal frameshifting to be as high as 25 %, but this has not been determined in the context of virus infection. It is unknown exactly why these viruses utilize frameshifting to control protein expression, but it is hypothesized to either control the precise ratio of rep1b and rep1a proteins or delay the production of rep1b products until the products of rep1a have created a suitable environment for RNA replication [34].",

However, \u03b3-coronaviruses do not contain a comparable nsp1. These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into the individual nsps [35]. Coronaviruses encode either two or three proteases that cleave the replicase polyproteins.

This was originally thought to occur during positive-strand synthesis, but now it is largely believed to occur during the discontinuous extension of negative-strand RNA [48]. The current model proposes that the RdRp pauses at any one of the body TRS sequences (TRS-B); following this pause the RdRp either continues elongation to the next TRS or it switches to amplifying the leader sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the genome guided by complementarity of the TRS-B to the leader TRS (TRS-L). Many pieces of evidence currently support this model, including the presence of anti-leader sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the negative-strand sub-genomic RNAs [38]. However, many questions remain to fully define the model. For instance, how does the RdRp bypass all of the TRS-B sequences to produce full-length negative-strand genomic RNA? Also, how are the TRS-B sequences directed to the TRS-L and how much complementarity is necessary [49]?

When M protein is expressed along with E protein VLPs are formed, suggesting these two proteins function together to produce coronavirus envelopes [55]. N protein enhances VLP formation, suggesting that fusion of encapsidated genomes into the ERGIC enhances viral envelopment [56]. The S protein is incorporated into virions at this step, but is not required for assembly. The ability of the S protein to traffic to the ERGIC and interact with the M protein is critical for its incorporation into virions.",

Some work has indicated a role for the E protein in inducing membrane curvature [57\u201359], although others have suggested that E protein prevents the aggregation of M protein [60].

However, it is unclear exactly how the nucleocapsid complexed with virion RNA traffics to the ERGIC to interact with M protein and become incorporated into the viral envelope. Another outstanding question is how the N protein selectively packages only positive-sense full-length genomes among the many different RNA species produced during infection. A packaging signal for MHV has been identified in the nsp15 coding sequence, but mutation of this signal does not appear to affect virus production, and a mechanism for how this packaging signal works has not been determined [22]. Furthermore, most coronaviruses do not contain similar sequences at this locus, indicating that packaging may be virus specific.",

For instance, Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) cause severe gastroenteritis in young piglets, leading to significant morbidity, mortality, and ultimately economic losses. PEDV recently emerged in North America for the first time, causing significant losses of young piglets. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) mostly leads to enteric infection but has the ability to infect the nervous system, causing encephalitis, vomiting, and wasting in pigs. Feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV) causes a mild or asymptomatic infection in domestic cats, but during persistent infection, mutation transforms the virus into a highly virulent strain of FCoV, Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), that leads to development of a lethal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP has wet and dry forms, with similarities to the human disease, sarcoidosis. FIPV is macrophage tropic and it is believed that it causes aberrant cytokine and/or chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion, resulting in lethal disease [63]. However, additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Bovine CoV, Rat CoV, and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections in cattle, rats, and chickens, respectively. Bovine CoV causes significant losses in the cattle industry and also has spread to infect a variety of ruminants, including elk, deer, and camels. In addition to severe respiratory disease, the virus causes diarrhea (\u201cwinter dysentery\u201d and \u201cshipping fever\u201d), all leading to weight loss, dehydration, decreased milk production, and depression [63]. Some strains of IBV, a \u03b3-coronavirus, also affect the urogenital tract of chickens causing renal disease. Infection of the reproductive tract with IBV significantly diminishes egg production, causing substantial losses in the egg-production industry each year [63]. More recently, a novel coronavirus named SW1 has been identified in a deceased Beluga whale [64]. Large numbers of virus particles were identified in the liver of the deceased whale with respiratory disease and acute liver failure. Although, electron microscopic images were not sufficient to identify the virus as a coronavirus, sequencing of the liver tissue clearly identified the virus as a coronavirus. It was subsequently determined to be a \u03b3-coronavirus based on phylogenetic analysis but it has not yet been verified experimentally that this virus is actually a causative agent of disease in whales. In addition, there has been intense interest in identifying novel bat CoVs, since these are the likely ancestors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and hundreds of novel bat coronaviruses have been identified over the past decade [65]. Finally, another novel family of nidoviruses, Mesoniviridae, has been recently identified as the first nidoviruses to exclusively infect insect hosts [66, 67]. These viruses are highly divergent from other nidoviruses but are most closely related to the roniviruses. In size, they are ~20 kb, falling in between large and small nidoviruses. Interestingly, these viruses do not encode for an endoribonuclease, which is present in all other nidoviruses. These attributes suggest these viruses are the prototype of a new nidovirus family and may be a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.",

            "text": "The most heavily studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which causes a variety of outcomes in mice, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic infections. These infections often serve as highly useful models of disease. For instance, MHV-1 causes severe respiratory disease in susceptible A/J and C3H/HeJ mice, A59 and MHV-3 induce severe hepatitis, while JHMV causes severe encephalitis. Interestingly, MHV-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade [68]. Most notably, A59 and attenuated versions of JHMV cause a chronic demyelinating disease that bears similarities to multiple sclerosis (MS), making MHV infection one of the best models for this debilitating human disease. Early studies suggested that demyelination was dependent on viral replication in oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord [69, 70]; however, more recent reports clearly demonstrate that the disease is immune-mediated. Irradiated mice or immunodeficient (lacking T and B cells) mice do not develop demyelination, but addition of virus-specific T cells restores the development of demyelination [71, 72]. Additionally, demyelination is accompanied by a large influx of macrophages and microglia that can phagocytose infected myelin [73], although it is unknown what the signals are that direct immune cells to destroy myelin. Finally, MHV can be studied under BSL2 laboratory conditions, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, which require a BSL3 laboratory, and provides a large number of suitable animal models. These factors make MHV an ideal model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronaviruses.",

Two of these human coronaviruses are \u03b1-coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, while the other two are \u03b2-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were isolated nearly 50 years ago [74\u201376], while HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have only recently been identified following the SARS-CoV outbreak [77, 78]. These viruses are endemic in the human populations, causing 15\u201330 % of respiratory tract infections each year. They cause more severe disease in neonates, the elderly, and in individuals with underlying illnesses, with a greater incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in these populations. HCoV-NL63 is also associated with acute laryngotracheitis (croup) [79]. One interesting aspect of these viruses is their differences in tolerance to genetic variability. HCoV-229E isolates from around the world have only minimal sequence divergence [80], while HCoV-OC43 isolates from the same location but isolated in different years show significant genetic variability [81]. This likely explains the inability of HCoV-229E to cross the species barrier to infect mice while HCoV-OC43 and the closely related bovine coronavirus, BCoV, are capable of infecting mice and several ruminant species. Based on the ability of MHV to cause demyelinating disease, it has been suggested that human CoVs may be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS).

It is the most severe human disease caused by any coronavirus. During the 2002\u20132003 outbreak approximately 8,098 cases occurred with 774 deaths, resulting in a mortality rate of 9 %. This rate was much higher in elderly individuals, with mortality rates approaching 50 % in individuals over 60 years of age. Furthermore, the outbreak resulted in the loss of nearly $40 billion dollars in economic activity, as the virus nearly shut down many activities in Southeast Asia and Toronto, Canada for several months. The outbreak began in a hotel in Hong Kong and ultimately spread to more than two dozen countries. During the epidemic, closely related viruses were isolated from several exotic animals including Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs [82]. However, it is widely accepted that SARS-CoV originated in bats as a large number of Chinese horseshoe bats contain sequences of SARS-related CoVs and contain serologic evidence for a prior infection with a related CoV [83, 84]. In fact, two novel bat SARS-related CoVs have been recently identified that are more similar to SARS-CoV than any other virus identified to date [85]. They were also found to use the same receptor as the human virus, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), providing further evidence that SARS-CoV originated in bats. Although some human individuals within wet animal markets had serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection prior to the outbreak, these individuals had no apparent symptoms [82]. Thus, it is likely that a closely related virus circulated in the wet animal markets for several years before a series of factors facilitated its spread into the larger population.",

In fact, many cytokines and chemokines are produced by these cell types and are elevated in the serum of SARS-CoV infected patients [90].

Viral titers seem to diminish when severe disease develops in both humans and in several animal models of the disease. Furthermore, animals infected with rodent-adapted SARS-CoV strains show similar clinical features to the human disease, including an age-dependent increase in disease severity [91]. These animals also show increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced T-cell responses, suggesting a possible immunopathological mechanism of disease [92, 93].",

This virus, named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), was found to be the causative agent in a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East [94]. Based on the high mortality rate of ~50 % in the early stages of the outbreak, it was feared the virus would lead to a very serious outbreak. However, the outbreak did not accelerate in 2013, although sporadic cases continued throughout the rest of the year. In April 2014, a spike of over 200 cases and almost 40 deaths occurred, prompting fears that the virus had mutated and was more capable of human-to-human transmission. More likely, the increased number of cases resulted from improved detection and reporting methods combined with a seasonal increase in birthing camels. As of August 27th, 2014 there have been a total of 855 cases of MERS-CoV, with 333 deaths and a case fatality rate of nearly 40 %, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.",

Serological studies have identified MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels in the Middle East [96], and cell lines from camels have been found to be permissive for MERS-CoV replication [97] providing evidence that dromedary camels may be the natural host. More convincing evidence for this comes from recent studies identifying nearly identical MERS-CoVs in both camels and human cases in nearby proximities in Saudi Arabia [98, 99]. In one of these studies the human case had direct contact with an infected camel and the virus isolated from this patient was identical to the virus isolated from the camel [99]. At the present time it remains to be determined how many MERS-CoV cases can be attributed to an intermediate host as opposed to human-to-human transmission. It has also been postulated that human-to-camel spread contributed to the outbreak.",

The identification of cases will guide the development of public health measures to control outbreaks. It is also important to diagnose cases of severe veterinary CoV-induced disease, such as PEDV and IBV, to control these pathogens and protect food supplies. RT-PCR has become the method of choice for diagnosis of human CoV, as multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed, are able to detect all four respiratory HCoVs and could be further adapted to novel CoVs [102, 103].

            "text": "Only limited options are available to prevent coronavirus infections. Vaccines have only been approved for IBV, TGEV, and Canine CoV, but these vaccines are not always used because they are either not very effective, or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic CoVs via recombination of circulating strains. Vaccines for veterinary pathogens, such as PEDV, may be useful in such cases where spread of the virus to a new location could lead to severe losses of veterinary animals. In the case of SARS-CoV, several potential vaccines have been developed but none are yet approved for use. These vaccines include recombinant attenuated viruses, live virus vectors, or individual viral proteins expressed from DNA plasmids. Therapeutic SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies have been generated and could be retrieved and used again in the event of another SARS-CoV outbreak. Such antibodies would be most useful for protecting healthcare workers. In general, it is thought that live attenuated vaccines would be the most efficacious in targeting coronaviruses. This was illustrated in the case of TGEV, where an attenuated variant, PRCV, appeared in Europe in the 1980s. This variant only caused mild disease and completely protected swine from TGEV. Thus, this attenuated virus has naturally prevented the reoccurrence of severe TGEV in Europe and the U.S. over the past 30 years [106]. Despite this success, vaccine development for coronaviruses faces many challenges [107]. First, for mucosal infections, natural infection does not prevent subsequent infection, and so vaccines must either induce better immunity than the original virus or must at least lessen the disease incurred during a secondary infection. Second, the propensity of the viruses to recombine may pose a problem by rendering the vaccine useless and potentially increasing the evolution and diversity of the virus in the wild [108]. Finally, it has been shown in FIPV that vaccination with S protein leads to enhanced disease [109]. Despite this, several strategies are being developed for vaccine development to reduce the likelihood of recombination, for instance by making large deletions in the nsp1 [110] or E proteins [111], rearranging the 3\u2032 end of the genome [112], modifying the TRS sequences [113], or using mutant viruses with abnormally high mutation rates that significantly attenuate the virus [114].",

First, understanding the propensity of these viruses to jump between species, to establish infection in a new host, and to identify significant reservoirs of coronaviruses will dramatically aid in our ability to predict when and where potential epidemics may occur. As bats seem to be a significant reservoir for these viruses, it will be interesting to determine how they seem to avoid clinically evident disease and become persistently infected. Second, many of the non-structural and accessory proteins encoded by these viruses remain uncharacterized with no known function, and it will be important to identify mechanisms of action for these proteins as well as defining their role in viral replication and pathogenesis. These studies should lead to a large increase in the number of suitable therapeutic targets to combat infections. Furthermore, many of the unique enzymes encoded by coronaviruses, such as ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase, are also present in higher eukaryotes, making their study relevant to understanding general aspects of molecular biology and biochemistry. Third, gaining a complete picture of the intricacies of the RTC will provide a framework for understanding the unique RNA replication process used by these viruses. Finally, defining the mechanism of how coronaviruses cause disease and understanding the host immunopathological response will significantly improve our ability to design vaccines and reduce disease burden.",
