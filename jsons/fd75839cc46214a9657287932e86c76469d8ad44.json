Analysis of a two-wave online panel survey found that traditional media use had a positive influence on MERS knowledge while social media use did not. However, knowledge did not facilitate preventive behaviors. In contrast, negative emotional responses due to media use stimulated desirable behaviors. Furthermore, social media use directly influenced behavioral responses but traditional media use did not show the same effects. Different functions of traditional and social media during an epidemic are discussed.",

However, both researchers and practitioners caution that media-social media in particular-may create misperceptions and amplify public fears by fostering public panic and proliferating unverified information (Kasperson, 1992) .

An infectious disease outbreak is a typical example of crisis in the public health context. Prior research has focused on how governments or other responsible organizations can achieve positive relationships with the public in managing a particular crisis. Based on the organization-public relationship (OPR) approach, scholars have theorized and investigated various (pre)conditions, attributes, and communication strategies of organizations to bring about positive relational outcomes with the public, such as satisfaction, commitment, trust, and mutual understanding (S.-U. Yang, 2018) . With respect to the MERS crisis in Korea, S.-U. Yang (2018) showed that the government's lack of dialogic competency negatively affected government-public relationships. Those findings indicate that the Korean government's lack of mutuality and openness weakened the credibility of its risk information, which produced negative relational consequences such as distrust and dissatisfaction and the intent to dissolve the relationship.",

As manifested by terms such as disaster marathon (Liebes, 1998) , the unexpected and impending nature of crises triggers media hype, which produces a prolific amount of reporting. Much research has investigated the characteristics of crisis coverage (Shih, Wijaya, & Brossard, 2008) . Shih and colleagues (2008) , for instance, found that the coverage of epidemics showed common patterns across discrete diseases, such as a high eventbase and emphasis on newly identified cases and government actions. With respect to the MERS crisis in Korea, Jin and Chung (2018) performed semantic network analysis of Korean and foreign media coverage of the crisis. They examined the most frequently used words (e.g., patient, hospital, infection, government, and case) and concluded that Korean media focused heavily on the number of cases and the government's responses, consistent with Shih and colleagues' findings (see Kwon, 2016, for similar findings) . Based on content analyses of crisis reporting, past research has also identified persistent problems in crisis reporting, such as excessiveness (Rezza, Marino, Farchi, & Taranto, 2004) , inaccuracy (Auter, Douai, Makady, & West, 2016) , and sensationalism (Moeller, 1999) . Korean media's MERS reporting was not exempt from sensational and excessive coverage of the contagious nature of the disease and patient counts (Kim, 2016; Kwon, 2016) .",

An outbreak of infectious disease causes not only human casualties but also massive economic harm. Different from chronic health risks, infectious pandemics trigger spontaneous and intense media attention (Posid, Bruce, Guarnizo, Taylor, & Garza, 2005) , which could create cascading effects in various public responses.

Public adoption of precautionary behaviors is critical to preventing large outbreaks of infectious disease, particularly in densely populated countries such as Korea. People need to behave in ways that prevent the spread of infectious disease and its consequences, and the media plays an important role in facilitating those behaviors (Gammage & Klentrou, 2011; Zhang et al., 2015) . Learning from media is one potential pathway to engagement in preventive behaviors (Sayavong, Chompikul, Wongsawass, & Rattanapan, 2015) . Besides cognitive responses, another way to galvanize preventive behaviors could be through emotional responses, which could alarm people enough to take proper actions with respect to a given risk. Research on risk and health communication has offered various theoretical models and empirical evidence for each approach (Boer & Seydel, 1996; Griffin, Dunwoody, & Neuwirth, 1999 ). Yet, there has been little research testing and comparing the two potential paths to preventive behaviors in the context of a pandemic crisis.",

The heavy emphasis on knowledge is largely drawn from the traditional Knowledge Deficit Model of Communication (Rutsaert et al., 2014) , which claims that a lack of understanding is the major obstacle to reasonable public responses to a risk or crisis. Therefore, it accentuates the scientific knowledge transfer from experts to the layperson and media have been regarded as a major conduit of knowledge transfer (Hilgartner, 1990) . Thus, when a crisis happens, government and responsible organizations attempt to work with media to disseminate crisis-related information, and the general public turns mainly to the media to acquire the information to deal with the atmosphere of uncertainty. Despite that widespread expectation, relatively little empirical attention has been given to whether public crisis knowledge is indeed increased by media use or whether understanding of a crisis indeed facilitates preventive behaviors in times of crisis.",

Little empirical evidence, however, has been collected in the context of urgent public health crises such as epidemics. On the contrary, disaster studies have extensively examined individual and group responses to impending threats (e.g., natural disasters or terrorist attacks). According to that body of research, in the face of an impending threat, people become more sensitive to cues about social environments and engage in searches for information as a basis for protective behaviors (Lindell & Perry, 2004) . However, despite the known contribution of media channels to these disaster research models, media variables have received insufficient attention in explaining the behavioral responses of individuals to crises.",

(2015) also found that media use potentially influenced H1N1 preventive behaviors through fear and perceived knowledge. The results of 36 national surveys in the United Kingdom indicate that exposure to media coverage or advertising about swine flu increased the adoption of recommended preventive behaviors (G. Rubin, Potts, & Michie, 2010) . Lin and Lagoe (2013) also showed that TV and newspaper use increased H1N1 risk perception and vaccination intent in media users. Based on those discussions and findings, it is expected that media use will facilitate public understanding of an emerging infectious disease and encourage appropriate precautionary behaviors. Media use in large-scale emergencies, however, still requires empirical scrutiny because of the many unexpected twists that characterize fluid crisis situations.",

The media also tends to focus more on the spread of a disease and the body counts rather than scientific causes (D. Rubin & Hendy, 1977) . These types of sensationalism can produce disproportionate public fear and panic responses to infectious diseases. Scholars such as Muzzatti (2005) have gone a step further and demonstrated that the media can actually manufacture threats to public health. Some prior works have examined the effects of media use on emotional reactions toward a crisis. Hoffner, Fujioka, Ibrahim, and Ye (2002) , for instance, found that people who learned about the September 11 terrorist attacks through mass media were more likely to report negative emotions than those who heard the news interpersonally.

Negative emotional experiences can stimulate people to seek pertinent information (e.g., the Risk Information Seeking and Processing (RISP) Model, Griffin et al., 1999) and encourage them to take preventive actions (e.g., Protection Motivation Theory [PMT], Boer & Seydel, 1996) . Unlike the cognition-based approach, which emphasizes the role of knowledge, these theoretical models focus on how negative emotions work as motivational drivers to guide people to protect themselves. Empirical work has supported those claims by showing that negative emotion can drive positive behavioral responses, including adopting recommended health behaviors (Ruiter, Abraham, & Kok, 2001) and engaging in information seeking (Z.

These trends are particularly salient in the context of crises, which are traditionally marked by high levels of information seeking by the general population. Evidence shows that people turn to social media during times of crisis to find information about safety instructions, news updates, and damage reports. Increasingly, the public expects even official agents to respond to public requests via social media in times of emergency, concurrent with traditional crisis management (Veil et al., 2011) . These heightened expectations are due in large part to perceptions of the benefits of social media for crisis communication.",

During the 2009 H1N1 virus outbreak, people exchanged information and experiences through social media (Chew & Eysenbach, 2010) . Social media, such as Twitter, has been used to quickly share initial information and updates during various types of crises, as well as to encourage specific actions, such as volunteering and precautionary behaviors (Potts, 2014) . The presence of social media as an information source becomes salient when traditional media provides limited information. For instance, Tai and Sun (2007) showed that, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, Chinese people turned to the Internet and message services to find information unavailable from the traditional media, which operate under close censorship by the Chinese government. Likewise, at the beginning of the MERS crisis, the Korean government withheld the list of hospitals affected by MERS, and the mainstream media adhered to the information embargo requested by the government. Limited access to needed information fueled fear, so people turned to social media instead of traditional media outlets (Kim, 2016) . Social networking service (SNS) users are likely to be exposed to messages that affect their perceptions and their use of preventive behaviors related to health risks and the crisis event. Vos and Buckner (2016) found that SNS messages in the 2013 outbreak of the H7N9 virus consisted mainly of sense-making messages to educate users about the nature of the risk and efficacy messages to encourage appropriate responses. In a similar line, Yoo, Choi, and Park (2016) found that receiving information about MERS through SNS directly encouraged MERS preventive behavioral intentions.",

Negative emotions are more likely than positive emotions to be floating around social media during an infectious outbreak, which could increase risk perception (Choi, Yoo, Noh, & Park, 2017) . For instance, Song et al. (2017) found that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety or fear) prevailed in online boards and social media during the MERS crisis. Often, information intertwined with emotional markers travels around social media, and emotionally charged messages are more likely than purely informational posts to be shared and diffused (Pfeffer, Zorbach, & Carley, 2014; Stieglitz & Dang-Xuan, 2013) . S. Choi, Lee, Pack, Chang, and Yoon (2016) mined Internet media reports about MERS in 2016 and examined their effects on public emotion expressed online, which they captured using a sentiment analysis. They mined all MERS-related news articles from 153 media companies, including the comments about each one. In a time-series analysis, they found a flow from Internet media to public fear. According to Song et al. (2017) , negative emotion accounted for 80% of all posts throughout online networks, especially Twitter, during the MERS crisis. Therefore, I have drawn the following four hypotheses. I expected that both traditional and social media use in times of crisis could directly and indirectly facilitate preventive behaviors (via MERS knowledge) and negative emotional responses to the MERS situation.

Because information disseminated through social media is often unverified, identifying accurate data and valid sources can be challenging and could both undermine relevant knowledge and exacerbate the consequences of emotional and behavioral responses.

In addition, social media generally deal with a rapid exchange of information, which could be more appropriate for short and clear MI than for scientific knowledge about a crisis. For instance, Won, Bae, and Yoo (2015) conducted an issue word analysis of SNS messages during the MERS outbreak and reported the six most frequently mentioned words on SNS at that time. Two of the six words were mask and hand sanitizer, which are clearly related to preventive behaviors. The other four words were hospital, infection, coughing, and checkup, which are also at least indirectly related to preventive behaviors. However, a big data analysis examining online news sites found that posts about symptoms, government reaction, disease treatment, business impacts, and rumors ranked higher than prevention-related information (Song et al., 2017) . Therefore, the effects of social media use on crisis knowledge and preventive behaviors might differ from those of traditional media.",

Two knowledge measures were excluded from CFA because measures were composed of all dichotomized items. Model modification was not utilized: \u03c7 2 (67) = 301.95, p = .00; normed fit index (NFI) = .95; incremental fit index (IFI) = .96; comparative fit index (CFI) = .96; root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) = .06 with 90% confidence interval (CI) = [.05, .07]. Factor loadings ranged from .51 to .98 and two factor loadings were rather low of .56 (one of MERS preventive behaviors) and .51 (newspaper use item). However all AVE (average variance extracted) were higher than .50 and factor loadings were still within acceptable range (Fornell & Larcker, 1981) . Therefore, all items remained. Path analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses with latent variables and two observed knowledge variables. The tested model included two control variables from Wave 1 data. Specifically, MERS knowledge and negative emotions about the MERS situation measured in Wave 1 controlled each of the Wave 2 variables accordingly. The research model showed a reasonably good fit according to commonly used criteria (Hu & Bentler, 1999) : \u03c7 2 (90) = 359.76, p = .00; NFI = .96; IFI = .96; CFI = .96; RMSEA = .056 with 90% CI = [.050, .062]. Figure 2 presents the overall results with path coefficients of the hypothesized model. H1 predicted that the more individuals use traditional news media (H1a) and social media (H1b), the more MERS knowledge they would acquire. As expected, MERS knowledge increased with increasing use of MERS-related traditional news media (\u03b2 = .13, p < .01), which supported H1a. On the contrary, MERS-related social media use was not significantly associated with MERS knowledge (\u03b2 = \u2212.04, ns), which did not support H1b. Therefore, H1 was only partially supported. H2 predicted that two types of media use would be positively associated with negative emotional responses to the MERS situation. Results showed that the more traditional media one used, the more anxious and worried about MERS one became (\u03b2 = .09, p < .05), which supported H2a. However, MERS-related SNS use and negative emotions was not significantly associated (\u03b2 = .05, ns), which failed to support H2b. Therefore, H2 was also partially supported.",

However, I did not find significant cognitive effects from social media use. Compared with traditional media, which mainly report information verified by expert sources (Lowrey, 2004) , social media can not only convey knowledge but also disseminate false or unverified information during a crisis. The null effect of social media use on MERS knowledge might thus result from the conflicting content of social media. This speculation, of course, should be verified with a robust empirical examination.",

Indeed, there is a lack of empirical research examining what kinds of crisis-specific responses could be elicited from the media individuals choose to use in times of crisis. In addition, RISP research provides a useful theoretical framework to predict that negative emotions could motivate people to seek information about a risk. However, this framework did not pay attention to media use, which can lead to behavioral consequences such as preventive behaviors beyond information seeking. This study addressed these gaps in the literature by directly testing the roles of negative emotions and media as potential sources of those emotions during a pandemic, which has been rarely examined in previous studies.",

This seemingly positive role of negative emotions, however, does not advocate for sensationalizing crisis situations. Instead, both government and media may consider applying knowledge about the potentially positive function of negative emotion to public communication during a crisis. For instance, risk and health communication research has developed guidelines on how to write a good fear appeal message in the public health campaign context.

Yang (2018) noted that Koreans in general tended to perceive the government's mutuality and openness in communication somewhat unfavorably, which often negatively affected government-public relationships. As S.-U. Yang (2018) showed, the Korean government's lack of mutuality and openness seems to have deteriorated the credibility of its risk information, which may have worsened the public's trust and satisfaction with the government. This unique situation might have lowered not only the credibility of government information but also the credibility of information from news media that relied heavily on the government for information. Accordingly, the low credibility of public information on MERS can explain the limited role of knowledge in promoting desirable behavioral responses. Prior work examining a different epidemic crisis found that one material factor influencing preventive action was respondent opinion about authorities (Quah & Hin-Peng, 2004) . My finding thus suggests that simple acquisition of disseminated scientific knowledge might not necessarily produce desirable behavioral responses from the public. It also implies that contextual factors, such as government dialogic competency, should be considered to fully grasp the role of knowledge in times of crisis.",

First, compared with traditional media, which is known to be powerful in knowledge diffusion, the interpersonal channel has been considered effective on behavioral responses via the normative route (Price & Oshagan, 1995) . The role of normative pressure on behavioral adaptation has been well documented in the health communication literature (e.g., Planned Behavioral Intention Model, Ajzen, 1991) .

Indeed, a prior work analyzing social media content during the MERS crisis reported that preventive behavior-related terms (e.g., masks and hand sanitizers) were the most frequently mentioned words (Won et al., 2015) . Furthermore, the most needed information at the beginning of the MERS crisis was the list of MERS-affected hospitals, which the Korean government had withheld. Given the government's unwillingness to share the list of hospitals, the public resorted to social media to actively seek, exchange, and share the hospital-related information. That piece of information could single-handedly trigger one preventive behavior (i.e., avoiding specific hospitals to protect themselves). Indeed, hospital was one of the terms most frequently used on social media during the MERS crisis (Won et al., 2015) . However, a big data analysis of traditional media reported that words such as infection, confirmed cases, and death were centrally located in traditional media content (Kwon, 2016) . In short, compared with traditional media, social media might play an essential role in virally diffusing MI (specific behavioral information, including where not to go and what to do).",

Yang, 2018) , some technological features of social media may have enhanced communication mutuality and openness which the Korean government and media lacked. Communication through social media may allow users to share empathy and social support. At the same time, social media-mediated communication can be perceived as more accessible and open than media-mediated communication. Strong mutuality and openness perceived through communication with network members on social media could have increased the credibility of MI which could have enhanced behavioral responses at least during the MERS crisis in Korea.",

This is quite an interesting finding because the Korean government strongly criticized media, especially social media, for releasing unverified rumors and fears. The lack of association between social media use and negative emotional responses could be a result of canceling out effects. In other words, social media might induce fear and anxiety, but social media might effectively cancel out the negative emotions by providing wanted social supports or MI, which should be under solid empirical scrutiny in the future study.",

The data are not based on a representative sample, which means the study findings must be interpreted with caution. For instance, online panels tended to include the younger and the more educated compared with the general population, which could influence the interpretation of the role of social media and traditional media use during the MERS crisis in Korea. The measurement of key variables also has limitations. For example, traditional media use was assessed only for newspaper and television. Omitting radio and general Internet use should be recognized as another major limitation of the study. Also, using quiz-type questions to tap MERS knowledge without close validation and planning might have contributed to the low correlation between the two MERS knowledge measures, which also raises a concern about a test-retest error involved in the panel data. These measurement issues could produce errors, which would be carried into the hypothesized path model this study proposed. In addition, Wave 1 data did not include MERS preventive behavior measures, which made it impossible to control all the endogenous variables in Wave 1 data. Therefore, it is hard to argue that an ideal panel data analysis was conducted for testing the proposed hypotheses.",
