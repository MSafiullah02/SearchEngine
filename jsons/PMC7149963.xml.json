The procedure should be performed with saline (0.9 per cent) and with use of fresh feces (body temperature, <2 hours old). Trophozoites in older specimens lose their motility and degenerate and become unrecognizable. The survival of trichomonads can be prolonged by adding 3 ml of 0.9 per cent saline to 2 g of feces. A small amount of feces is placed on a warm slide and a drop of 0.9 per cent saline is mixed with the feces. Alternatively, a miniscule amount of fresh feces can be collected by insertion of a cotton-tipped swab into the rectum. The smear must not be too thick, because trophozoites will be missed easily. A simple rule of thumb is that the observer should be able to read the fine newsprint of a newspaper through the smear.",

The sensitivity of direct fecal smear examination for diagnosis of T. foetus is relatively low in cats with spontaneous disease (14 per cent).8 In addition, T. foetus can be difficult to distinguish from nonpathogenic intestinal trichomonads such as Pentatrichomonas hominis using light microscopy. T. foetus should be distinguished from Giardia spp. Giardia trophozoites have a concave ventral disc, and motility that mimics a falling leaf. In contrast, trichomonads are spindle-shaped, have an undulating membrane that courses the entire length of the body, and move in a more irregular and jerky fashion. In contrast to Giardia spp., trichomonads do not have a cyst stage, which underscores the limitations of fecal flotation technique for diagnosis of trichomoniasis. Trichomonads will not survive refrigeration and are found rarely in formed fecal specimens.",

This may reflect an alteration of the endogenous intestinal microflora that supports the trichomonads, or effective resolution of cofactors (Giardia spp., Cryptosporidia spp., other coccidia), that could exacerbate the cats\u2019 diarrhea. Prolonged use of antimicrobials has not been successful for long-term control of diarrhea and may delay the onset of clinical remission or exacerbate the diarrhea in some animals. In addition, higher doses of certain antibiotics such as metronidazole and paramomycin may cause adverse effects in cats, including neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity,10 respectively. A recent report showed that more than 50 per cent of cats diagnosed with T. foetus\u2013associated diarrhea were still shedding the organism up to 5 years after diagnosis based on PCR confirmation, and diarrhea persisted for up to 3 years in many cats, despite aggressive antimicrobial administration.11 Relapses of diarrhea were common and associated with dietary change, medical treatments unassociated with T. foetus infection, and travel.11 Currently, it is unknown whether long-term infection of cats with T. foetus is a predisposing factor for development of inflammatory bowel disease. In light of the poor host specificity of T. foetus and the intimate association between infected cats and their human companions, the potential for zoonotic transmission should be considered. A single case of human infection with T. foetus has been documented in the literature to date. In that case, the infection presented as epididymitis and meningoencephalitis after immunosuppression and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.12\n",

Current laboratory protocols for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in fecal specimens include microscopic examination of smears stained with Giemsa, the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique (Figure 15-3\n), the modified Kinyoun acid-fast technique, or use of an immunofluorescent detection procedure (Figure 15-4\n).20, 21 Immunofluorescent detection procedures are more sensitive and specific than acid-fast stains and generally are the method of choice for morphological diagnosis in human beings.22 Microscopic techniques work well when clinical signs are present and oocyst numbers are relatively high; however, once clinical signs abate and oocyst numbers are greatly decreased, the sensitivity of tests relying on morphological identification is reduced and diagnosis often requires examination of multiple fecal specimens. In these cases, the newer enzyme immunoassays designed to detect Cryptosporidium spp. antigens in feces have proven more sensitive.23 Difficulties in detection and enumeration of oocysts in fecal specimens are compounded by variation in consistency between individual fecal specimens, the amount of specimen used, and oocyst losses incurred during recovery processes. Although several diagnostic tests have come into widespread general use, the veterinary literature lacks published data that compare different diagnostic methods in cats. No single procedure has become adopted universally.",

The performance characteristics of this test have not been well characterized; the test must be scrutinized against the performance characteristics of other ELISAs, fecal flotation, and the immunofluorescence assay. Preliminary studies in our laboratory found a relatively high sensitivity (86 per cent) for the Remel ProSpecT Microplate ELISA in cats naturally infected with Giardia spp., whereas the Remel ProSpecT Rapid ELISA had an unacceptably low sensitivity of 56 per cent.29 Immunofluorescence detection procedures (see Figure 15-4) are more sensitive and specific than acid-fast stains and generally are the method of choice for morphological diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis in human beings.22\n",

Specifically, gross fecal contamination should be removed as much as possible on a daily basis. Runs should be rinsed with water, after which a layer of disinfectant foam (Roccal D) should be applied. After 10 to 20 minutes, the foam should be rinsed away with fresh water.

Plasma or colloids (dextran 70 or hetastarch) are indicated if the serum albumin concentration drops below 2.0 g/dl. Antibiotics are administered to febrile or severely neutropenic cats. If the animal is neutropenic but afebrile, prophylactic administration of a first-generation cephalosporin is reasonable. Cats in septic shock should be treated with a broad-spectrum aerobic and anaerobic antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin plus amikacin). Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 5 \u03bcg/kg q24h SC will increase neutrophil numbers but may not influence outcome. Antiemetics such as prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, or ondansetron are indicated if vomiting is intractable. Metoclopramide is most effective when administered as a constant rate infusion at a dose of 1 mg/kg q24h. Gastric protectants including H2-receptor antagonists and sucralfate are indicated when there is evidence of secondary esophagitis. Broad-spectrum anthelminthics to treat concurrent intestinal parasites should be administered when the cat is no longer vomiting. Most cats can be weaned gradually onto a digestible commercial enteral diet; however, intractable vomiting may warrant the administration of total or partial parenteral nutrition (see Chapter 16).",

Finding intestinal parasites in the feces of a kitten with diarrhea does not establish parasitism as the cause of the intestinal disease, although many kittens show a partial or complete resolution of clinical signs after administration of a broad-spectrum anthelminthic. We deworm diarrheic kittens routinely even in the face of a negative fecal flotation or negative Giardia ELISA. Serological screening for feline leukemia virus is recommended for kittens with chronic diarrhea that have not responded to antiparasitic and dietary therapy. Metronidazole administration often is associated with some amelioration of diarrhea, possibly because of altering the intestinal microflora, dampening cell-mediated immunity, or killing a specific pathogen such as Clostridium difficile. Dietary modification should be considered in cats that fail to respond to empirical antiparasitic therapy and metronidazole administration. We frequently use commercial feline intestinal diets and have had success using a diet that is highly digestible and contains relatively large amounts of fermentable fiber. Kittens that fail to improve on a commercial diet can be fed a cooked turkey or chicken diet (without carbohydrates) for 5 to 10 days to provide a highly digestible meal containing moderate amounts of fat. Dietary fat restriction does not appear to be as important in cats with intestinal disease as it is in dogs. Home-cooked diets are not complete and balanced and should not be fed to kittens for more than 10 days.",

Kittens with chronic ileitis could have secondary deficiencies of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), an important micronutrient for DNA replication in the intestinal crypts (see Chapter 13). Vitamin B12 can be administered empirically to kittens at 100 \u03bcg per kitten, given subcutaneously once weekly for 4 to 6 weeks. Repeat injections should be based on determination of serum cobalamin concentrations. Cobalamin is safe, easy to administer, and cheap. Use of prebiotics and probiotics for diarrheic animals has received tremendous attention recently; however, most studies completed have not been performed in animals with clinical disease.

Relying on results of fecal culture alone is wrong, because C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter spp., and pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli are isolated commonly from apparently healthy cats. Fecal cultures may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques such as PCR for detection of specific toxin genes, or for molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks.
