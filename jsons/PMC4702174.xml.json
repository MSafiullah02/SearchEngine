IL-6 was first induced at 8 h post-infection (h.p.i.), IP-10 and RANTES were induced after 24 h.p.i. However, H9N2 did not significantly increase IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 1D), MCP-1 (Fig. 1E) and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 1F) in HPMECs.

We have tested the cytotoxicities of indirubin derivatives in HPMECs prior to the ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, no significant cytotoxicity was observed at or below 10 \u03bcM in HPMCEs. Next, indirubin derivatives were found to suppress H9N2-induced IP-10 (Fig. 3A), RANTES (Fig. 3B) and IL-6 (Fig. 3C) expression in a concentration-related manner. E804 significantly inhibited cytokines expression at 1 \u03bcM, a similar inhibitory effect was observed when a higher concentration of E231 (10 \u03bcM) was used. Both indirubin derivatives slightly induced and inhibited the basal level of RANTES and IL-6 respectively. It may be due to the regulatory effects of indirubins on innate immunity45. For the IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 3D) and IFN-\u03b31, (Fig. 3E) both E804 and E231 (1 \u03bcM) could significantly reduce H9N2-induced expression. On the other hand, to examine the antiviral property of indirubin derivatives, we measured the viral matrix 1 (M1) gene expression in HPMECs. The RT-PCR result showed that H9N2 could efficiently replicate and transcribe viral protein in HPMECs, but neither indirubin derivatives E804 nor E231 could reduce H9N2 M1 gene expression (Fig. 4A). The plaque formation assay further confirmed efficient virus replication in HPMECs (Fig. 4B). However, both indirubin derivatives cannot reduce the virus titer in H9N2-infected HPMECs.",

Also, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 could significantly suppress the production of IL-6 (Fig. 5C) and showed partial inhibition on IP-10 (Fig. 5A) expression induced by H9N2. To confirm the suppressive effects of different MAPKs inhibitors on cytokines are not due to impaired viral replication, we introduced viral RNA into HPMECs as a non-dynamic viral stimulus. HPMECs were transfected with viral RNA or cellular RNA in the presence or absence of different MAPKs inhibitors (Supplementary figure 1)46. Similar to the results of direct virus infection, viral RNA stimulated cytokines expressions, and the inhibitory effects of MAPKs inhibitors were very similar to the experiments in direct infection. This confirmed that the suppression effects of MAPKs inhibitors on cytokines expression were not due to their potential effects on viral load. As a result, the anti-inflammatory effects of indirubin derivatives are mainly due to its inhibitory effects on different kinases.",

Endothelial cells in the pulmonary vasculature form a barrier between the blood and interstitium. This strategic position suggests that pulmonary endothelial cells are prone to be affected by the cytokines and viral particles released from the IAV-infected epithelial cells. A recent study by Teijaro et al.> identified endothelial cells as the central orchestrator which contribute to the aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production during early IAV infections22. Concomitant with our in vitro data, we showed that H9N2 virus can efficiently infect HPMECs (Fig. 4A,B) and induce a significant amount of IP-10, RANTEs, IL-6, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b31. IP-10 and RANTES are the chemoattractants for leukocytes including T cells, NK cells, and granulocytes, while production of IL-6 by endothelial cells initiates infiltration of neutrophils in the early phase of infection47. These cytokines have been found histopathologically in the lungs (including epithelial and endothelial cells) of H5N1 infected patients, who showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)48, and ARDS can be characterized by progressive pulmonary endothelial damage. It has been suggested that treatment with antibodies against IP-10 in H1N1 infected mice can improve the survival rate and reduce acute lung injury49. Furthermore, suppression of early innate cytokine and chemokine production in the pulmonary endothelium can significantly improve survival of mice infected with lethal H1N1 Swine IAV22. These studies suggested that inhibition of cytokines production of the pulmonary endothelium is an attractive therapeutic strategy against IAV-induced cytokine storm.",

In this study, we demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives, particularly E804 on IAV-infected pulmonary endothelial cells. Over the past two decades, many studies have identified that indirubin derivatives are potent inhibitors of various kinases, including MAPKs3536, Src kinase37, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2)50 and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)51. Based on these findings, potential functions of indirubin derivatives have been proposed, including anti-inflammation35404142, anti-leukemia36, antiviral3839 and angiosuppression5253. Crystal structure analysis revealed that indirubin can form three hydrogen bonds with the ATP-binding pocket of CDKs, thereby competitively inhibiting ATP binding in the catalytic domain of CDKs36. The results from our in vitro kinase assay also demonstrated that E804 is a potent inhibitor of p38 and JNK (Fig. 7C,D). The cytokine ELISA data also suggest that H9N2-induced IP-10 expression of HPMECs was dependent on p38 and JNK activation, while RANTES and IL-6 were controlled by JNK and p38, respectively (Fig. 5A\u2013C). However, the Western blot analysis showed that E804 could also inhibit phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 7A) and JNK (Fig. 7B), which mean upstream kinases of p38 and JNK may also be inhibited by E804. MAPKs are important mediators of influenza-induced cytokine expression. In fact, p38 has been shown to regulate the stability of IL-6 mRNA54. Meanwhile, another study also indicated the critical function of p38 on IP-10 during viral infection55. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 by specific inhibitor SB202190 in vivo can greatly diminish H5N1 lethal infection28. However, the role of JNK in IAV infection has not been fully examined. Nacken et al.> elucidated that influenza viral RNA induces JNK phosphorylation in an RIG-I dependent manner, but the NS1 of IAV has also an intrinsic JNK activating property56. Taken together, the potent inhibitory effect of p38 and JNK signaling pathways by E804 strongly correlates with its anti-inflammatory function.",

            "text": "IFNs are pro-inflammatory cytokines crucial for antiviral responses to IAV infection. STAT1 and STAT2 are predominant and essential transcription factors of type I and II interferons signaling pathway, but the role of STAT3 activation after IFN binding remains controversial. Undeniably, STAT3 is indispensable for downstream signaling pathway of many other cytokines like IL-6, VEGF or EGF57. Our data showed that H9N2 infection on HPMECs can significantly induce IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b31 expression. Interestingly, STAT3-specific siRNA has no effect on H9N2-induced IL-6 (Fig. 5F) and IFN-\u03b31 (Fig. 8B), but strongly inhibit IFN-\u03b2 expression level, indicating the involvement of STAT3 in IFN-\u03b2 induction. The Western blot data showed that IAV-infection could activate STAT3 in early stage (15 min after addition of virus) followed by another activation at 2 h.p.i. (Fig. 6). H9N2 was found to upregulate TLR-8 and MyD88, which is critical to the induction of IFN-\u03b258. In line with this finding, the early activation of STAT3 may function together with the downstream signaling molecules of TLR-8, possibly the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), to induce rapid expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA at 2 h.p.i. (Fig. 1H). And then the autocrine effect of IFN-\u03b2 induces a further amplification of IFN-\u03b2 expression and result in a cytokine storm. A previous study suggested that E804 could inhibit STAT3 dimerization and subsequent DNA binding37. Our translocation experiments clearly indicated that E804 could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Since the induction of many pro-inflammatory cytokines requires type I interferon signaling, inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production by E804 may blunt the early induction of these cytokines. Though IFN-\u03b2 is a well-known antiviral cytokine, it is also involved in the pathogenesis of influenza infection. In vivo studies focusing on the S1P1 receptor and p38 pathway also suggested that, even the IAV-induced IFNs were suppressed by an S1P1 receptor agonist22 or p38 inhibitor28, the survival rate of the infected mice could still be significantly improved if those strongly induced cytokines were suppressed. In many studies, increased viral load were concomitant of reduced interferons expressions. However, in the present study, viral titer did not further increased in indirubin derivatives treated cells (Fig. 4B) even IFN\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b31 were suppressed, the results indicated that suppression of cytokines produced by the infected pulmonary endothelium could reduce IAV pathogenicity independent of the viral clearance. In fact, many kinases including CDK39 and MAPKs, which are suggested being involved in the influenza replication process are also the target of indirubin derivatives, this might explain the partial antiviral effect of indirubin derivatives in this model.",

However, to achieve the best clinical outcome, antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs should be administrated at the appropriate time during an infection. Further understanding of the immune dynamic could allow us to design an optimum therapy strategy. In this report, we demonstrated for the first time, the potent immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives on pulmonary endothelial cells and their therapeutic potential for IAV-infection (Fig. 9).
