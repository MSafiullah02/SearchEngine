Two unique equilibria called measles-free and endemic (measles-present) are shown to be locally asymptotically stable for basic reproductive number R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1, respectively. While using Lyapunov functions, the equilibria are found to be globally asymptotically stable under the former conditions on R 0 . However, backward bifurcation shows coexistence of stable endemic equilibrium with a stable measles-free equilibrium for R 0 < 1. A strategy for measles control based on herd immunity is presented. The forward sensitivity indices for R 0 are also computed with respect to the estimated and fitted biological parameters. Finally, numerical simulations exhibit dynamical behavior of the measles system under influence of its parameters which further suggest improvement in both the vaccine efficacy and its coverage rate for substantial reduction in the measles epidemic.",

In this connection, real measles incidence cases as given in Table 1 are used for validation of the proposed measles model and also to obtain best fitted values of some unknown biological parameters that occur in the model. For the model in present research analysis, there are seven parameters among which four are to be fitted, whereas remaining three are estimated such as the natural mortality rate \u03bc of a Pakistani is 66.5 years (1.253133e\u221203 per month) according to WHO data (year-2018) and the population of Pakistan in 2018 is 207862518 and in this way, the recruitment rate is estimated to be = 207862518 \u00d7 \u03bc \u2248 260479. Further, it is also known from [35] that the measles vaccine is about 97% effective; therefore, the vaccine efficacy \u03c4 is estimated to be 0.97. In addition to these estimated values, values of other parameters are mentioned in Table 2 where the parameters \u03b2 (contact rate), \u03b4 (recovery rate), \u03b1 (rate of developing clinical symptoms) and \u03be (vaccination coverage rate) are obtained through parameter estimation technique under lsqcurvefit routine via MATLAB software.

In Fig. 4 , the burden of the measles epidemic is observed to have declining behavior if the vaccination coverage rate (\u03be ) is improved, whereas this burden is substantially reduced for reasonably small value of the measles contact rate (\u03b2) as shown in Fig. 5 . However, these measures are not easy to be taken in a developing country like Pakistan. Therefore, an effective step could be the improvement in the efficacy of the vaccine (\u03c4 ) which reduces the burden of the epidemic as shown in Fig. 6 , but the government of Pakistan will have to strive for making the vaccine cost-effective in order to be affordable by people living near the poverty line. On the other hand, improvement Page 13 of 21 378 Table 2 in the recovery rate (\u03b4), as shown in Fig. 7 , does reduce the epidemic's burden, but this measure is not as effective as taking efforts to reduce contacts among infectious and the susceptible ones. Moreover, the higher the rate of developing clinical symptoms (\u03b1) more will be the number of infectious individuals as theoretically predicted. This theoretical observation is further confirmed by the infectious population in Fig. 8 , but the infection seems to vanish as time goes by. In order to further support the analysis and observation regarding the proposed measles model (2.1), contour plots (Figs. 9, 10, 11 and 12) for the basic reproductive number are obtained as function of some biological parameters wherein the contact rate (\u03b2) is kept on the vertical axis in an increasing fashion and the parameters \u03c4, \u03be, \u03b4, \u03b1 are set on the horizontal axis with their increasing values. The most significant observation from these contour plots is that the burden of the measles epidemic can effectively be reduced by reasonably increasing the values of \u03c4, \u03be, \u03b4, \u03b1 among which the vaccine's efficacy (\u03c4 ) and vaccine's coverage rate (\u03be ) play important roles. Finally, the small value for the vaccine's coverage rate (\u03be ) is not as bad as the equally small value of the vaccine's efficacy (\u03c4 ) as depicted in Fig. 13 ; however, larger value of (\u03c4 ) is capable enough to bring R 0 straight toward 0, whereas R 0 is not exactly 0 even for the maximum value of (\u03be ). Thus, the vaccine's efficacy (\u03c4 ) plays the most significant role to reduce the burden of the measles epidemic.",

In this regard, we divided the popu- Table 2 lation into five classes of susceptible, vaccinated, exposed, infectious and recovered human population. Parameters involved in the system are obtained with assistance of parameter estimation technique under nonlinear least squares fitting strategy which later produced best fitted curve for the infectious class of the system to the curve of real experimental measles cases obtained from WHO from the month January 2019 to October 2019, in Pakistan. Thus, the proposed measles system is validated having reasonably small relative error value of 1.4685e\u221201. Two unique steady-state solutions are computed for the measles system which are shown to be locally and globally asymptotically stable via Routh-Hurwitz stability theory and Lyapunov functions, respectively, under different constraints imposed upon R 0 . Thus, the epidemic is said to have died out for R 0 < 1, whereas it persists in the case when R 0 > 1. In addition, the measles system undergoes backward bifurcation wherein a stable endemic equilibrium is found to coexist with a stable measles-free equilibrium for R 0 < 1. The minimum fraction of population that must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity is determined which shows that both the vaccine efficiency and the vaccinated fraction must be sufficiently high for elimination of measles. The sensitivity analysis shows that the parameter for vaccine efficacy (\u03c4 ) is the one taken to be care of which is further confirmed in various numerical simulations carried out. In addition, there is need to attain higher vaccine coverage rate which is vital to preventing the disease spread. Hence, vaccine efficacy and its coverage both seem to have substantially positive roles for effective control and elimination of measles burden in the suffering community. ",

Fractional-order operators including Weyl, Riesz, Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, Atangana-Baleanu, Atangana-Gomez, fractal-fractional and others have capability to capture complex and anomalous behavior of dynamical systems that describe a physical or natural phenomenon. The non-local nature of these operators retains memory of the underlying processes which proves to be fruitful in case of epidemiological models since such models are designed to comprehend transmission dynamics of an epidemic which, in turn, has characteristics of memory. Thus, the future works will be devoted to the use of the above operators from fractional calculus for improving the measles system introduced in the present research study.",
