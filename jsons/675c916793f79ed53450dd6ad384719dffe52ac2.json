Hunting is particularly prevalent among the large-bodied fruit bats of the Old World tropics, where half (50 %, 92/183) the extant species in the family Pteropodidae are hunted. Pteropodids that are hunted are six times more likely to be Red Listed as threatened: 66 % of species in IUCN threatened categories (CR, EN, VU, NT), compared to 11 % of species in the 'Least Concern' (LC) category. However, there still appears to be an information gap at the international level. One third of the hunted species on the Red List are not considered threatened by that hunting, and nearly a quarter of the bat species included in this review are not listed as hunted in IUCN Red List species accounts. This review has resulted in a comprehensive list of hunted bats that doubles the number of species known from either the IUCN Red List species accounts or a questionnaire circulated in 2004. More research is needed on the impacts of unregulated hunting, as well as on the sustainability of regulated hunting programs.

Here, we summarize what is currently known about the exploitation of bats for consumption and medicinal use, synthesizing the 2009 review with what has been published since and unpublished information the authors have gathered from colleagues. The result is a comprehensive list of hunted bats species that contains nearly twice as many species as known from either the IUCN Red List species accounts or the 2009 review. It is unclear whether the increased concern about hunting is the result of greater actual hunting pressure, or just represents our increased understanding of hunting impacts. What is clear is that reviews now explicitly attribute species declines and extinction risk to hunting pressure.",

Mildenstein unpublished data) . In locations where domestic meats and fish are generally preferred, such as Madagascar (Randrianandrianina et al. 2010) , bushmeat becomes more important in periods of food shortage (Jenkins and Racey 2008) . Similarly, on the island of Yap (Micronesia), hunting is socio-economically based, and bats are less desirable than seafood. Only people of lower social ranks with no access to the coast hunt fruit bats (Falanruw 1988) . Consumption of bushmeat varies indirectly with the availability of other protein sources (e.g. in west Africa: Brashares et al. (2004) ). In areas where bats are eaten, they are rarely the only available source of protein. The exception to this is in times of food insecurity, when people turn to bats as a food source, especially following natural disasters (e.g. typhoons: Aldabra flying fox, Pteropus aldabrensis, Mickleburgh et al. 2008a ; Vanuatu flying fox, Pteropus anetianus, ; Ontong Java flying fox, Pteropus howensis, Helgen and Allison 2008 ; Rodrigues flying fox, Pteropus rodricensis, Mickleburgh et al. 2008b ; Samoan Flying Fox, Pteropus samoensis and P. tonganus, Brooke 2001, and P. mariannus, Esselstyn et al. 2006 , USFWS 2009) and during civil unrest (e.g., Bougainville monkey-faced fruit bat, Pteralopex anceps antrata, S. Hamilton, pers. comm.) . Similarly, species found in low-lying areas (e.g. P. aldabrensis and P. howensis) may become increasingly important food to local communities as rising sea-levels destroy other food sources (Mickleburgh et al. 2008a; Helgen and Allison 2008) .",

Although insectivorous bats are considered to be less palatable in many regions and may appear to be under low hunting pressure, (Kamins et al. 2011; Dougnon et al. 2012) this is not necessarily the case. Goodman (2006) showed that in addition to fruit bats, mainly the Malagasy straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon dupreanum), P. rufus, and the Malagasy rousette (Rousettus madagascariensis), insectivorous H. commersoni is frequently hunted, especially during periods of food shortages. In addition, while fruit bats are probably the most commonly hunted group, 64 % of the 55 bat species hunted in Africa are animalivores (Appendix).",

Whether roosting colonies are in caves, cliffs, or trees, hunting at the roost site is likely to affect the entire colony. Hunting disturbance at the roost site causes injury to many bats from the spread of shot gun pellets, large-scale infant mortality when pups fall from fleeing mothers (Mildenstein and Stier unpublished data; R. Ulloa, pers. comm.) , and higher stress levels as resting bats are startled and forced to flee from hunters (Van der Aa et al. 2006) . In their survey of P. rufus in Madagascar, Mackinnon et al.

Now, all but five of these hunted species (25/30, 83 %) have been moved up to a higher threat status because of perceived pressures that hunting causes (IUCN 2014). Overhunting is a recognized factor in the loss of three (and probably also the little known fourth) of the now extinct fruit bat species (IUCN 2014) and a cause behind local extirpations within species' historic distributions (e.g. Polynesian sheath-tailed bat, Emballonura semicaudata, from Vanuatu, Helgen and Flannery 2002) . Similarly, the declines of seven of the ten fruit bat species listed as critically endangered are attributed directly to hunting; the remaining three species are still virtually unknown (IUCN 2014) (Table 12 .2).",

            "text": "The increased concern about bat hunting may be due to greater hunting pressure, or may just represent our increased awareness of hunting impacts. What is clear is that bat conservation biologists now explicitly attribute species declines and increased extinction risk to hunting. Seven hunted bat species previously assumed to be unaffected by hunting (Mickleburgh et al. 1992 ) now have hunting listed as a major threat (IUCN 2014). Most (68 %) of the species that are hunted, are listed as threatened by that hunting, while only 15 % of the hunted species are expected not to be affected. However, it should be pointed out that for the remaining 38 % of hunted species, reviews remain ambivalent about whether hunting is a problem. Similarly, in the review of bats as bushmeat carried out in 2004 (Mickleburgh et al. 2009 ), 59 % of questionnaire respondents said bat hunting occurred in their region, and over half (54 %) of those species hunted were perceived to be negatively affected (Table 12 .2). The general consensus among biologists and managers is that hunting is a major conservation threat. Despite lacking measures of hunting impacts, there are many examples of population declines and extirpations of bats that are hunted (e.g. loss of historical bat roosts and reduced population sizes in Madagascar, Mackinnon et al. 2003 ; and in the Philippines, Heideman and Heaney 1992). Biologists studying Old World fruit bats currently rank hunting as the top conservation concern for this taxon (Mildenstein 2012) . The IUCN Red List also reflects this concern. Fruit bat species that are known by the IUCN to be hunted are almost three times more likely to be listed as threatened (N = 58 spp. in IUCN categories: CR, EN, VU, NT compared to 21 species in the \"LC\" category) ( Fig. 12. 2). However, there still appears to be an information gap at the international level. Nearly 42 % (70/167) of the hunted species listed in this review are not listed by the IUCN Red List as threatened by hunting. Half of these (35 spp.) may be for lack of awareness, as they are not known to be hunted at all by the IUCN. The other half are described as hunted by the IUCN but not considered to be threatened by that hunting. In other words, these 35 species are described as hunted in their Red List species accounts, but then hunting is not included in the list of threats (compiled from IUCN 2014).",

The first was Halstead's (1977) on the Ile-Ife campus of the University in Nigeria, which was unfortunately cut short by his return to the UK. Brooke and Tschapka (2002) modeled what would be \"sustainable take\" on Niue, based on the current bat population size and estimated reproductive rates. Comparing their modeled sustainable take to the numbers of bats hunted on Niue, they determined current hunting rates were unsustainable. Epstein et al. (2009) estimated potential harvest rates of P. vampyrus in Malaysia as a function of the number of hunting licenses issued. Incorporating these hunting mortality rates into their estimated bat population growth matrix, they projected declines in the Malaysian bat population using even the most conservative measures of hunting pressure. On Madagascar, Goodman (2006) extrapolated total hunting pressure on hipposiderids from a single hunter he interviewed. Comparing this estimated mortality rate to the local bat population surveyed, he then inferred hunting levels were detrimental, because take exceeded the breeding potential of the local bat populations.",

In Madagascar, Goodman (2006) used his interview of a single bat hunter as a sample to extrapolate local hunting pressure on hipposiderids. In Niue, Brooke and Tschapka (2002) used government permit records to identify households with guns potentially used for hunting, and then interviewed a third of these potential hunters about their bi-monthly harvest rates. The authors used their results from this sample to extrapolate to hunting pressure over all hunters during the two month hunting season on the island. Kamins et al. (2011) interviewed a total of 551 Ghanians including hunters, vendors and consumers, demonstrating a high off-take of >128,000 E. helvum per year. A recent study on the same population used annulus markers in teeth to age bats and develop a static life table to determine age structured survival rates (Hayman et al. 2012) . Markets were surveyed in Sulawesi to determine bat consumption rates of local people and number of bats exported to neighboring provinces for trade (Sheherazade and Tsang 2015) . A questionnaire survey in 13 villages in Madagascar resulted in an estimate of 6500 bats taken each year (Razakarivony 2003 ) and staff at a roadside restaurant in western Madagascar reported serving about 30 P. rufus each day, which extrapolates to 10,000 a year ). The largest roost counted during surveys at that time consisted of 5000 individuals (Mackinnon et al. 2003) which cast doubt on the reported rate of bat consumption. Nevertheless about 30 live P. rufus were present in panniers in the food storage area of the restaurant during a casual visit ). Also in Madagascar, Oleksy et al. 2015b) interviewed hunters to learn about bat numbers taken as well as the location, time of night, and season in which the hunting occurred, to measure harvest rates.",

Two decades later, the population sizes of these bats is much larger and considered stable (Brooke and Wiles 2008, A. Miles pers. comm.).",

            "text": "Theoretically, hunting can be sustainable if regulated tightly to ensure population declines due to harvest do not exceed what bat populations can naturally replace given the range of environmental variability to which they are subjected (methods in Mills 2012). Although several countries permit hunting, bat hunting has generally proved difficult to regulate for sustainability for a number of reasons. In some places, hunting laws are hard to understand and therefore not followed by hunters. In Madagascar for example, bats can be hunted legally between May and August or February to May, depending on the species (Jenkins and Racey 2008) . In addition, according to the regulations, hunting is allowed only during the day, and game species cannot be hunted at their roost. Hence bat hunting is technically impossible, but hunters harvest bats despite the rules ). In other countries, hunting regulations are poorly designed from a conservation perspective. In peninsular Malaysia, bat hunting is legal and numbers harvested are said to be regulated. However, while limits on the number killed are issued by the provincial government where the hunter resides, the license owners are allowed to hunt in multiple provinces which creates a potential for seasonal take that far exceeds the bat populations' capacities for regeneration (Epstein et al. 2009 ). In Niue, bat hunting is allowed for two months per year. Hunting levels are not regulated because of the assumption that the bat supply is unlimited. However, bats roost in sacred forest grounds that are taboo for humans to enter, making it impossible to obtain a count of the population size. Based on models of similar species, harvest rates exceed what is expected to be sustainable (Brooke and Tschapka 2002) .",

Now, these bats have been extirpated from most islands. Fewer than 15 mixed colonies remain, often with less than 2000 individuals and dangerously small numbers of the endangered A. jubatus. (Mildenstein 2012) . In addition to already being at historically low population sizes, other human-caused stressors (persecution, habitat fragmentation, global climate change and other perturbations described in this book) continue to act on bat populations, exacerbating detrimental effects of harvest.

The presence of monks and religious activities turn these areas into de facto sanctuaries for bats that would otherwise experience hunting pressure. In nearby non-Buddhist countries, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, the same fruit bat species colonize other \"safe\" spots such as privately protected lands and parks, especially in the forest interior, using topographical features that afford protection from people (e.g. along rivers, within mangrove islands, and on cliff edges, Mildenstein 2012). Active protection of roost sites alone (i.e. hunting still occurs away from the roost) has been shown to result in as much as ten times the number of roosting fruit bats for the same amount of forest habitat, and is especially important for sensitive species such as ecological specialists (Mildenstein 2012) .

Bats are not cryptic animals, especially fruit bats that aggregate in large numbers by day using conspicuous roosting sites, and they often forage at night in fruiting and flowering trees on farms and in residential areas. Hence, local people's knowledge of bats often surpasses that of outside biologists, especially with respect to bat roosting locations, foraging habits, seasonal behaviors, and even threats (e.g. local community members' awareness of subtle seasonal changes in fruit bat diet of P. mariannus, Mildenstein and Mills 2013) . It is, therefore, surprising how little is known about bat conservation status in these same areas. Population size and growth trends tend to be unknown by biologists and managers, much less by the non-scientific members of the local community. So, even though local people are aware of the disturbance they may be causing, they often have no idea of the severity of population-level consequences. Because bats appear to be numerous, popular belief is that humans can have only minimal impact on their populations. For example, the greater short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx) is believed by experts to be threatened by hunting in parts of its range, but in other parts, <1 % of local people surveyed believe the species could be threatened by their hunting (Johnson et al. 2003) . Similarly, throughout the Philippines, bats are eaten regularly with little understanding of the impacts that harvest is causing. Hunters who join biologists on bat population counts commonly overestimate the population size by three orders of magnitude prior to the count and then are shocked when the counted population is in the hundreds or low thousands (Mildenstein et al. 2007; Mildenstein 2012) .",

In communitybased conservation management, stakeholders from a variety of factions within the community are required to work together to implement effective conservation practices. This often creates unlikely partnerships that bridge normal political, socioeconomic and religious divides. For example, former rebels work with local government officials to monitor bats in southern Mindanao, Philippines, a region known for often violent stand-offs between the Philippine government and Islamic separatists (LM Paguntalan pers. comm., SOS 2012). Uniting stakeholders toward the common goal of bat conservation, however, creates collaborative programs that prove to be robust to the changes that commonly lead to the demise of wildlife conservation programs (e.g. change in political administrations). Validity of data. A frequent concern when working with citizen scientists, is that data gathered by untrained biologists may be less accurate and obscure the signal that is being studied (reviewed in Johnson 2008) . However, communitybased bat counts are perhaps a best case scenario for the use of citizen science. The data gathered are the number of bats observed, requiring just the ability to count and no other special training or equipment. Because bats, especially fruit bats, tend to aggregate, the population being counted is all in one place, by-passing many sources of error arising from sampling approaches to abundance assessment. Finally, the goal of community-based counts is detection of population trends across time, so that local communities can track impacts that hunting may be causing. Studies of count error in untrained observers show that while training and experience has a positive effect on count accuracy, counts made by untrained observers are as likely to detect population trend direction as those made by experienced biologists (Mildenstein 2012; Mildenstein and Mills 2013; Barlow et al. 2015) .",

Following the decline in populations of P. rufus in Madagascar from overhunting and habitat loss, the NGO Madagasikara Voakajy engaged local communities at four roost sites for the protection of the species. With the help of the local government, roost sites were designated for protection and firebreaks with bare ground areas constructed around roost sites. Local volunteers where trained to monitor the roosts of P. rufus using binoculars and hand tally counters and have continued to do so. In addition, the engagement of local people led to an interesting partnership where habitat restoration through tree planting is ongoing, while local farmers receive support through a crop seed loan system. Similarly, the local community is enforcing sustainable land use within the protected roost areas. The project organizers ascribe the success of the project to environmental education and outreach efforts, highlighting the benefits of local community engagement through citizen science and partnerships that improve local economies (Mahefatiana Ralisata pers. comm.).",

Guam's last colony of P. mariannus has declined precipitously since the establishment of the invasive brown treesnake (Boigia irregularis, USFWS 2009). In the past 10 years the bats have no longer been aggregating in the historical colony location but rather are seemingly scattered in the forest, making population abundance assessments using traditional roost counting methods impossible. Given limited human resources and adherence to historical practices, biologists contracting with the US government have conducted fruit bat surveys sequentially using one or two observers from single observation sites in the forest on a survey morning. These surveys yield occasional bat sightings and location information but provide no basis on which to estimate the population size of the bats, which is essential to generate funding and motivate protective management of this formally-recognized USA national endangered species. In 2014, a different approach to surveying was initiated. Using 85 trained citizen scientists placed at observation stations throughout the forest, simultaneous observation permitted a survey of about 10 % of the forest habitat on Andersen Air Force Base. This collaborative project between the University of Guam and the U.S. Navy resulted in the first population size estimate for the threatened P. mariannus since the early 2000s. The survey also brought together local stakeholders representing 25 government and non-government organizations (including schools, environmental clubs, hunters, and local media) toward the common goal of supporting the conservation of a local endangered species (Fig. 12.4 ; ).

Collecting these data requires trained biologists, sociologists, statisticians, and well-planned survey techniques and questionnaires that can address sensitive questions. For many regions and species, there is little or no population information on bats, so that population trends are unknown. Managers are therefore encouraged to start monitoring programs by which hunting impacts on population size can be tracked over time. Some bat conservation initiatives provide useful models for population size assessment and monitoring (e.g. Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Research Unit, Filipinos for Flying Foxes, WCS Malaysia, United States Department of Defense in the Mariana Islands, FFI Cambodia). Using the population size estimation and monitoring described, more studies are also needed that investigate the direct and indirect impacts of hunting on bat populations. For example, long term monitoring projects of both people and bats, could show trends in the correlations between number of hunted bats and bat population responses. Finally, more needs to be learned about the people hunting bats and the conditions that lead to increased hunting (Cawthorn and Hoff 2015) . If it is understood why people hunt (e.g. for protein? for livelihoods? to vary their diet? for Fig. 12.5 Members of the women's peanut cooperative in Madagascar, which grows peanuts to supplement local protein supplies and uses a portion of the proceeds to pay rangers to protect fruit bat roosts (Razafimanahaka 2013) tradition?) and what are the patterns in hunting intensity (e.g. seasonal, food insecurity), conservation managers can find creative solutions for mitigating hunting impacts (e.g. Razafimanahaka 2013; Fig. 12 .5).",

Once communities understand that human disturbance has population-level impacts and that conservation management must balance negative impacts with the bats' innate ability to add to their population, community-level planning of a sustainable hunting program can ensue. Targets must be established for minimum population sizes and numbers of viable populations before hunting can be allowed.

With more research and experience, conservation managers have become increasingly aware of the negative impacts caused by hunting even on small scales, i.e. for personal use and/or local trade. Especially detrimental is hunting at roost sites, which can lead to a tenfold increase in population declines (Mildenstein 2012) . This is probably because hunting disturbance at roosts also affects non-target individuals, including mothers and babies which are especially sensitive to disturbance. For hunted bat taxa (e.g. Old World fruit bats), hunting now ranks as a top threat among bat conservation biologists.",

However, for 28 % of the species known to be hunted according to IUCN Red List species accounts, hunting was either not considered to be a threat or not evaluated at all. Finally, information about a quarter (38/167) of the species listed as hunted by this review has come from sources other than the IUCN Red List, where there is no mention of hunting for those species.

Similarly, research on the use of bats for medicinal purposes should investigate patterns of bat use and ailments that bat consumption is said to cure. Study of the effects of bat use on ailing consumers in situ as well as in randomized trials could play a significant role in conservation by helping tease out whether the medicinal properties of bats have a real effect or are a myth.
