The role of Se in maintaining animal health ABSTRACT: In newborn dairy calves, it has been demonstrated that supranutritional maternal and colostral Se supplementation using Se yeast or sodium selenite, respectively, improves passive transfer of IgG. In beef cattle, agronomic biofortification with Se is a more practical alternative for Se supplementation, whereby the Se concentration of hay is increased through the use of Se-containing fertilizer amendments. It has been previously demonstrated that agronomic Se biofortification is an effective strategy to improve immunity and performance in Se-replete weaned beef calves. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of feeding beef cows Se-enriched alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay during the last 8 to 12 wk of gestation on passive transfer of antibodies to calves. At 10 wk \u00b1 16 d before calving, 45 cows were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups with 3 pens (5 cows/pen) per treatment: Control cows were fed non-Se-fortified alfalfa hay plus a mineral supplement containing 120 mg/kg Se from sodium selenite, Med-Se cows were fed alfalfa hay fertilized with 45.0 g Se/ha as sodium selenate, and High-Se", "cite_spans": [{"start": 98, "end": 125, "text": "(Ammerman and Miller, 1975;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 126, "end": 158, "text": "Hefnawy and Tortora-Perez, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 282, "end": 315, "text": "(Hefnawy and Tortora-Perez, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 316, "end": 342, "text": "Willshire and Payne, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 343, "end": 362, "text": "Ahsan et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "cows were fed alfalfa hay fertilized with 89.9 g Se/ha as sodium selenate; both the Med-Se and the High-Se groups received mineral supplement without added Se.

It is likely that the Se status of the cows, the form of Se administered (organic vs. inorganic), and the rate of Se supplementation (duration of feeding and concentration of Se in forage) are all important in determining whether an effect on colostral IgG concentration is observed. Based on the current results, forage Se provides a linear dose vs. time supplementation strategy for increasing IgG concentrations in colostrum. Kamada et al.

The linear relationship between Se fertilizer application rate and forage Se concentration observed in this study is similar to what we have previously reported (Hall et al., 2009 (Hall et al., , 2013a . Plants, including alfalfa, absorb sodium selenate from the soil and synthesize selenoamino acids, with selenomethionine being the major selenocompound in forage legumes (Whanger, 2002) . Plant species, chemical source of Se applied, and soil pH, sulfur, and iron content may alter Se availability for plant uptake as reviewed by the NRC (1983 NRC ( , 2007 . These results suggest that Se content of soil, determined by Se application rate, is the primary determinant of Se content of common forage species. Future studies are needed to evaluate in greater detail the Se flow between fertilizer, soil, and plant. In the current experiment, there was a linear relationship between Se fertilizer application rate (g Se/ ha) and forage Se concentration (mg Se/kg DM), which extends to cow WB, colostrum, and calf WB Se concentrations (ng/mL). Future experiments are needed to determine whether these mathematical relationships are consistent between experiments.
