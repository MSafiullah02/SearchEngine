Besides offering molecular diagnosis and quantitative measurement of viral load, PCR-based technologies have also been exploited to amplify the genomic fragments of SARS-CoV for sequence analysis. The high sensitivity and specificity of PCR has made this genomic sequence analysis possible even for uncultured clinical specimens. Unlike the conventional microbiological methods, PCR-based technologies may not require viral culture, which could introduce culture-derived artifacts in the genomic sequence. The specific PCR primers selectively amplify SARS-CoV sequences from the background of other nucleic acid sequences contributed by the patient or other microbes. Moreover, the PCR-based method is versatile in terms of the type of clinical specimens. In our hands, we have successfully analyzed the SARS-CoV genome directly from uncultured samples of serum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and stools (11). This obviates any concern about the poor or even unsuccessful viral culture of the precious clinical specimens. The risk in handling large-volume and hazardous viral culture could also be avoided.",

            "text": "Genomic sequence variations were observed in the SARS-CoV obtained from different patients in this epidemic. Based on these sequence variations, most of the isolates are typified by two groups: isolates obtained from patients who were epidemiologically linked to the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong, and those who were not (3, 12, 13). For example, there are seven sequence variations that can distinguish isolate CUHK-Su10, which is linked to the Metropole Hotel, from isolate CUHK-W1, which is not linked to this hotel case cluster (Table 1). Among them, four variations at nucleotide positions 17564, 21721, 22222, and 27827 (according to the Tor2 sequence in GenBank, accession no. AY274119 [5]) were suggested by The Chinese SARS molecular epidemiology consortium (14) as part of a haplotype configuration that marks the different phases of a tri-phasic SARS epidemic in Guangdong Province of China. CUHK-W1 carried a haplotype G:A:C:C that typified the middle phase. Notably, the same haplotype was observed in CUHK-L2, which was one of the earliest confirmed case of SARS in Hong Kong, having been documented even before any report of the hotel case cluster (15). CUHK-Su10 carried a haplotype T:T:T:T that typified the late phase, marked by the hotel case cluster that spread the virus to many other parts of the world. Genomic sequence variations in SARS-CoV have also revealed the route of infection from within communities and across cities. For instance, compared with isolate CUHK-Su10, two mutations, T3852C and C11493T, first appeared in isolates CUHK-AG01, CUHK-AG02, CUHK-AG03 (GenBank accession numbers AY345986, AY345987, AY345988) obtained from patients involved in the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong (11). Later, these two genetic fingerprints appeared in 10 completely sequenced Taiwanese isolates (16). Interestingly, toward the end of the epidemic, another type of fingerprint was found by PCR-based method. A variant of the SARS-CoV with a 386-nucleotide deletion was reported in a cluster of patients that seem to be epidemiologically related (17). Most of the cases were part of a documented outbreak in the North District Hospital in Hong Kong. We have illustrated that sequence variations among different isolates have a remarkable epidemiological correlation. Thus, PCR amplification followed by sequencing is a powerful tool in tracing the route of transmission. The sequence information may provide objective support to epidemiological investigations. Moreover, in the event that SARS re-emerges, one could quickly gain important insight into the origin and evolution status of the SARS-CoV simply by sequencing the critical sequence variations of the genome, as exemplified here. However, to extract this wealth of information from the limited primary clinical SARS specimens, we need very sensitive and efficient protocols to efficiently amplify fragments of the SARS-CoV genome for analysis.\n\n",

            "text": "\nFor RNA extraction, carrier poly (A) RNA is added to the lysis buffer to increase the yield. Because the PCR primers are specific to the SARS-CoV genome, the subsequent amplification would not be affected. However, if one wants to perform 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3\u2032 RACE) or similar cloning operation that depends on oligo(dT) priming of poly(A) tail of the viral RNA, then the carrier poly(A) RNA should be avoided.Our previous studies have shown that, with two rounds of PCR, even direct clinical samples can be sequenced. This obviates the need for viral culture, which may pose a health hazard if not handled properly. It also minimizes the possible generation of viral mutants through culturing. However, direct clinical samples of high viral titer and a sensitive PCR amplification are required.Yields of viral RNA should be determined by quantitative RT-PCR, because spectrophotometric determination is prone to error as a result of low RNA quantity and interference by the carrier poly(A) RNA, which contributes to most of the RNA present.A prolonged denaturation step is used to remove secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV genome that impede reverse-transcription. The use of random hexamer ensures an even representation of the whole RNA genome and allows more sequence information to be obtained from a limited amount of viral RNA.We recommend the use of a reverse transcriptase with increased thermal stability, which facilitates reverse-transcription at a higher temperature (55\u00b0C) than normal (42\u00b0C). This unfolds some of the secondary RNA structures, and thus produces longer cDNA at higher yields.We recommend the simultaneous use of two different DNA polymerases in the PCR amplification. For example, the cDNA polymerase mix that we use contains KlenTaq-1 DNA polymerase, and a second DNA polymerase with 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 proofreading activity. The inclusion of a minor amount of a proofreading polymerase results in an error rate that is significantly lower than that for Taq alone (18). This advantage is obvious when one is concerned about genomic sequence variations between different viral strains. The use of a two-polymerase system also increases the efficiency and yield, and hence the sensitivity, which is important when the viral titer is suboptimal.The carryover of unused PCR primers into the sequencing reaction would lead to poor sequencing results. Like the sequencing primers, these unused PCR primers would also bind nonspecifically to the sequencing template in the cycle sequencing reaction, and, hence, generate noisy sequencing traces overshadowing the intended traces. Purification of the PCR products is, thus, usually recommended prior to their use as sequencing templates. However, these methods are laborintensive and pose extra contamination risk, as they involve additional steps of opening and handling PCR products. Notably, we have suggested an optimized PCR protocol for direct sequencing of PCR products without PCR product purification. With the low PCR primer concentrations and the optimal number of cycles, most of the PCR primers are consumed at the end of the PCR. Furthermore, a nested sequencing primer selectively extends the specific PCR product in the cycle sequencing reaction. This would suppress any nonspecific PCR product from extension. The combined effect is a neat sequencing trace.The amount of PCR product used for the sequencing reaction must be optimized carefully with different sequencing systems. Although more PCR product input usually gives higher signal intensities, it may also give shorter read lengths and oversaturated signals.The PCR primers target 50 700-bp amplicons that overlap with each other along the SARS-CoV genome. The sequencing primers are designed in such a way that any sequence masked over by the PCR primer binding sites and the sequencing primer peak on one amplicon are reliably backed up by the homologous sequence in the overlapping amplicon.We advocate scrutinizing efforts in validating any genomic sequence variation by resequencing regions with different combination of primers and sequencing chemistry. Because variation seen in a single viral isolate could potentially be a result of sequencing artifacts, we consider only the genomic sequence variations that are shared by at least two SARS-CoV isolates.\n",
