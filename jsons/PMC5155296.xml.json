Some of these High5 backgrounds would have yielded incorrect positivity in the unblocked BuV IgG EIAs, more with BuV2 and 3 than BuV1 or TuV antigens. However, we were able to distinguish false from genuine reactivity by competing with insect cell lysate, as can be seen in patient number 4 (Tables 2 and 3): the BuV2 and BuV3 reactivities were completely blocked in the competition assay by insect cells, but less or not at all by VLPs of either of these two BuVs, whereas the BuV1 result was blocked with the homologous BuV1 (Table 3).

Of the Asian subjects 5/12 were positive, and the highest number was observed among Indian persons of whom 3/6 were BuV-IgG positive. These individuals had also the highest BuV IgG OD values, unlike the children or adults of Finnish descent. In addition, the prevalence of BuV antibodies in Finnish children (3.1%, 7/228) was identical to that in the native Finnish adults (3.1%, 5/163) raising the question why the BuV IgG prevalence did not increase with age. Although we did show that the antibody levels among adults can remain constant for at least six years, waning of the antibodies over time might play a role. Furthermore, if the primary infection of the host is local and superficial, it might not induce a strong long-lasting antibody response. With HBoVs it has been shown that exposure to homo- or heterologous HBoV species may boost the antibody response2829. Thus, the similar BuV seroprevalence among Finnish adults and children might be a consequence of the general rarity of BuV infections in the Nordic countries, leading to inadequate maintenance of antibody responses.",

These BuV2 or 3 IgG-positive children were 7 months to 5 years of age at the time of sampling (2009 to 2011), suggesting that BuV2 and maybe BuV3 might have circulated in Finland between 2006 and 2011. Unfortunately, we do not have travel information of these children. The BuV3 antibodies in the two 7- to 8-month-old infants might be maternal.

Therefore, B19V serodiagnosis can be done reliably using as antigen VP2 VLPs of any of the variants323334. On the other hand, the more divergent four HBoVs (with a 11\u201323% difference in the major capsid protein aa sequence) are partly cross-reactive in EIA19. The cross-reactivity can be visualized by blocking the serum with heterologous HBoVs prior to the EIA. To identify such cross-reactivity is a prerequisite for correct interpretation of the HBoV EIA results1929. The human bufavirus genotypes differ by 27\u201336% in VP24, and in our EIA analysis the BuV genotypes were not cross-reactive. Neither the BuV genotype, the antibody level in the sample, nor the age of the subject affected assay specificity.

The children were divided in three groups based on signs and symptoms: acute gastroenteritis (AGE, n = 172), acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI, n = 545) or symptoms of both (n = 238). The median age was 14 months (range 6 days \u2013 15.6 years). There were patients both from a paediatric outpatient clinic, 137 (14.3%), and a hospital ward, 818 (85.7%). Stool and nasal swab samples were available from every child and serum samples were from 228 children of whom blood sampling was medically indicated. A written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all the children enrolled. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Pirkanmaa Hospital District, and, and the study was conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.",

This procedure would reveal any unspecific background due to various factors, allowing their assessment in more detail. To confirm the IgG results and determine the antigenic cross-reactivity of BuV1-3 and TuV, all samples showing measurable OD values (\u22650.1) were subjected to homologous and heterologous competition, as described for human bocaviruses19. In brief, the plasma or serum sample was mixed with an unbiotinylated antigen (VP2-VLP at 20 \u03bcg/ml or High5 insect cell lysate at 0.5 mg/ml) prior to the EIA of interest. Each reactive sample was separately blocked both with the homologous antigen, which should fully block a specific reaction, and with all four heterologous antigens, which should not block the specific reaction. The overall BuV-IgG result after competition was considered positive when no heterologous blocking occurred and the residual OD fell upon homologous blocking (i) below OD 0.2, when the non-blocked OD was >0.5; (ii) below OD 0.15, when the non-blocked OD was 0.3\u20130.5; and (iii) below 50% of the non-blocked OD, when the non-blocked ODs were low, 0.1\u20130.3. Examples of blocking results are shown in Table 3. For effective blocking in TuV EIA, a 5-fold higher concentration of homologous blocking antigen, compared to that in BuV EIA, was required (Case 18, Table 3).",
