According to the Centres of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA, 2004) (Henning, 2004), Syndromic surveillance has been used for early detection of outbreaks, to follow the size, spread, and tempo of outbreaks, to monitor disease trends, and to provide reassurance that an outbreak has not occurred. Many information systems have been created based on data from the internet to fulfill this goal; the early detection of epidemics. During the last 14 years, a new approach has begun since 2004 with the famous work of Johnson et al. (2004), when the scientists tried to take advantage of the Web search queries to reveal the spread and the peak of influenza in the United States. Since then, various researches have been conducted with the help of web data (social media, search engines, etc.) to establish the fundamentals of internet surveillance systems. This novel approach deals with the implementation of information systems based on data from the web to track epidemics and to create patterns and rules for an early prediction. Across all over the world, at universities, organizations, or research centers, scientists study the potential of the web in epidemics. Except from various information systems and methods created for data analysis of the web data, new terms were introduced to describe this new approach and trend, such as Infoveillance or Infodemiology (Eysenbach, 2006, Spruit and Lytras, 2018).",

A lot of articles refer to influenza and particularly to the H1N1 virus that was responsible for many cases with severe symptoms during that year. This virus type has an unusual characteristic: it does not affect people over 60 years old but many young people, adults, and children. This virus type can lead to pneumonia if not early diagnosed and treated. The term swine flu was used by the news media in America and a lot of money were directed to the treatment of this disease. For instance, in Russia, the government has allocated 4 billion rubles (US$140 million) to buy the initial 43 million doses of vaccines, to perform mass swine flu vaccinations during the year 2009.

The above statement is important, since indicates the use of weather data to track the presence of influenza. If this is true, then future information systems could be based both on web data and weather data. Such an effort is described in the research of Shikha et al. (2017). This is a very interesting aspect, since it is not widely researched and could be researched further. A surveillance system may be created, based on weather forecasts that can be accessed through the internet and give warnings about a possible spread of a disease, for example, influenza based on weather conditions. Regarding influenza, it is considered that the spread can be extensive in areas with cold and dry weather conditions (World Health Organization, Media Center, Influenza Overview, Fact Sheet no 211, March 2003) (World Health Organization, 2003). Furthermore, it might be interesting to analyze the spread and the outbreak of diseases with discrimination between urban and rural regions, taking into account that most infectious diseases are developed in a considerable extend in crowded cases, such as big and populous areas, for example, large metropolitan cities. This could be interesting, as in rural areas, internet data may be less or more difficult to be discovered, especially in some countries with vast territories or less developed.",

The data from the web are now abundant and many scientists can take advantage of it. Many fields of science are now included in this effort to harness the web and estimate epidemics and health issues. Computer science, statistics, sociology, and medicine work together to investigate the appropriate method to exploit the web data. Various methods are used to analyze the data in a complex framework with the ultimate goal for the social benefit. While broadband internet is nowadays widely used as the data speeds are growing with VDSL and ADSL lines (Very high speed digital subscriber line, Asymmetric digital subscriber line) by using fiber optics cables, there is still a part of the world undeveloped, such as Africa, Central America, or South America. As we saw, only four studies examine web data for Africa, one for Central America, and six for South America, as people in these countries may still have not the economy power, the expertise, or the infrastructure to widely use web services.

Through the special APIs (REST and STREAMING API), there is the capability to track messages real-time, geolocated from almost every part of the world.

Peek, Holmes, and Sun (2014) research is about the effective management of big data, collected through both traditional and internet surveillance systems. The scientists of this research believe that data for health and biomedicine have become so big and complex that the traditional methods and tools for managing them are not efficient any more. They call this development a big data revolution. They examine and discover the technical aspects of big data and the infrastructure needed for the management of them, to provide useful information. They also review analytical information about health and biomedicine regarding selection of cases and control, bias and confounding in observational data and techniques for mining health dimensional data. These data come from medical records, administrative data, web search logs, and social media. It is widely recognized that internet and electronic health data are quickly growing as technology advances. Capturing health data from various sources needs a change in the technical and management techniques regarding, such as the infrastructure, the file systems as well as the multidimensional data processing. To catch data from the internet, this can be done either with real-time techniques and nonreal-time techniques. Nevertheless, if we need early prediction of epidemics, we must support real-time data gathering and new technologies must be introduced to do so, such as Apache Spark and Storm.",

The researchers of this study concluded that the use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena and there is also an evolution of the tools and the methodology to exploit them. Although these surveillance systems, based on internet data, have a support function to the traditional ones, they require a high level of familiarity about capturing social behavior through social media. The data from social media, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, are abundant, but the quality of health information among users in these media is highly variable and this may raise some concerns (Schein, Wilson, & Kealan, 2011) that social media users are exposed to unopposed viewpoints that counter core public health recommendations. We believe that this is logical but partly true as people interact with each other through social media about health issues, but it is hard to imagine that an individual could ignore the official treatment and medication or precaution measures for severe health issues just based on what people say in the social media. On the other hand, a person could be further alerted using social media.",

It is a strategy to capture real-time online data. These data can be systematically mined, aggregated, and analyzed to inform public health and policy. Social media are also considered as a real-time source of epidemic intelligence. Epidemics can be monitored through accessing the expected magnitude, peek time, and intensity, and the duration (Nsoesie, Brownstein, & Ramakrishnan, 2013). The data from the internet can inform healthcare practitioners on when to expect changes in demand for healthcare resources. A surveillance system based on real-time data could provide the means to do so. Nevertheless, in some cases, a precise estimation is not always successful. GFT is an online system that provides useful data, based on Google searches made for influenza. This system was developed by Google and during the first working period, it could also provide estimates and predictions. GFT is now no longer publishing current estimates, since it missed the emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic and overestimated the 2012\u201313 influenza season epidemic (Olson, Konty, Paladini, Viboud, & Simonsen, 2013). Google searches though were used by many scientists and researchers to track epidemics, using various statistical methods that were very successful. Generally, we must consider that a general rule cannot be found for all countries and all diseases, but each one of the latter requires deep statistical analysis; a pattern of a disease in one country may differ in another. It is possible, however, to build systems based on internet data, social media, search engines, etc., but each system requires methods, which can be similar or not. The global pattern of human behavior and globalization can help this, since internet allows people to interact to an electronic system (such as Google Search) or to each other (social media). It is true that internet-based approaches are logistically and economically appealing. However, they do not have the capacity to replace traditional surveillance systems; they should not be viewed as an alternative, but rather as an extension (Milinovich, Williams, & Hu, 2014). Of course, many people could say that the previous statement is thought to be based on today\u2019s technology. In the future, as the research continues, technology will further advance and the credibility of internet-based systems will probably be better and wide across the world. The findings of the researches until today show that the potential of creating such internet surveillance systems becomes more possible over time.",

            "text": "The main conclusions of this review can be summarized as follows:1.\nResearch\nThere is an extensive literature related to the field of syndromic surveillance using the web. This review has gathered the biggest collection of articles and publications on this field ever made, totally 225. Of course, we may assume that more publications can be found except from Google Scholar or using other search queries, but the bulk of the gathered literature in this review is quite enough to extract useful results and conclusions.The academic interest is still growing, especially after 2009. The years containing relevant publications extend from 2004 to the year of 2018. Since 2009, the number of publications has risen, after the 2009 pandemic of influenza. The total number of authors in publications is 786 worldwide. These two facts are important as they reveal the significance and the future perspectives of this research field.Many health topics have been discussed, while most of them are about influenza. It seems that for influenza a lot of data are available through internet, but the fact that totally 34 severe diseases have been included is also important, as it shows the potential of the web data to be used for syndromic surveillance.Most articles examine North America, the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia, since these are mainly the origins of scientists and data are broadly available in these areas of the world. Almost all regions of the earth have been examined for epidemics, but some areas, such as Africa, South America, or Central America, are underexamined. The contribution of scientists across the world is also extensive, since researchers from 32 countries of the world have published works on this field.2.\nInternet surveillance systems\nTwitter at first and secondly Google are the most referred and used web data sources, although other social media, search engines, health records, and web logs have been widely used. There is a rich collection of various web data and electronic systems that have been built to present an internet surveillance system.Various models for data analysis and techniques are used to correlate health data to data from the internet. In some occasions, scientists show that a prediction of epidemics is possible before the official data are announced from the competent health authorities. This prediction was achieved 6\u201313 weeks prior to the official data. Another important aspect is that, using web data, we could estimate a disease development in shorter surveillance time intervals; while most of traditional surveillance systems monitor epidemics on weekly or monthly basis, information systems based on web data could provide daily monitoring or even for shorter periods.3.\nSmart Healthcare systems\nSmart Healthcare innovations can use internet-based surveillance systems to assist in the awareness and direction of information to people, medical science and organizations, as well as the policy decisions. With the continuous use of internet, Global System for mobile communication networks, smart mobile devices, and health information could lead to a better understanding and informative techniques regarding epidemics. Within the concept and realization of IoT, early detection and prevention of epidemics could be the common policy for the future, rather than treatment, by reducing costs and procedures. Technology infrastructure will change to deal with the big data revolution, as not only humans, but also smart devices would probably be constantly connected and interact with each other.KDP is a constant effort to derive knowledge out of data. This can be thought as an adaptive procedure in relation to the technology progress. Health data have been always sensitive and not easy to use. The same applies for internet data, even though they are not considered as epidemical, but inspect and reveal an epidemic from other sources, for example, social media, web searches, etc. Internet, but mainly Smart technologies, could become irrepressible, if not treated under the previous assumption. Future research could also be dedicated on this matter. Both Internet surveillance systems and Smart Healthcare have the same destination: to improve the quality of life.4.\nOutlook\nThe potential of the research on this field remains broad and other diseases except from influenza could be further examined. In addition, the research could be driven to other aspects of syndromic surveillance, such as the weather conditions or the distinction of epidemics in between urban and rural regions with the use of data from the web. Furthermore, although the impacts of internet data for monitoring epidemics may be obvious, it could be more discussed in the future.Web can be a useful tool for obtaining data and make predictions for epidemics despite sometimes the restrictions of accuracy or the size of the data. Internet-based surveillance systems can be established to track epidemics and could work as alternative, supportive or as an extension to traditional systems.Finally, we believe that the contribution of this study is that it showcases the extended research and use of internet surveillance systems, the techniques, and the future perspectives within the concept and framework of Smart Health. Technology advance requires change of the way we think of data, information, and how to deliver them to accomplish the improvement of public health.\n",
