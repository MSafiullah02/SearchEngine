The United States has now emerged as the global epicenter. As states move to lift intervention measures, it becomes more important to estimate the rate at which the epidemic is growing using the realtime effective reproductive number, R t . Using a collated time series of daily state-wise positive case counts from the COVID Tracking Project 2 , we estimate R t to provide a baseline estimate of the impact of all combined non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) at the state level and for the entire country. We present the results for each state and the whole country in a user-friendly web interface updated daily at https://covid19-realtimereproductionnumber.shinyapps.io/ShinyAPP/. We calculate R t using two complementary methods, the Wallinga and Teunis (WT) method 3 which is forward-looking and the Cori method 4 which is backward-looking. We also present two daily test metrics: test utilization per capita and the positive tests per capita 2 alongside R t for each state (See Figure 1 with Utah and the U.S. as examples). The results for all 50 states and the U.S. are provided as supplementary materials.",

            "text": "The overall downward trend indicates that most states have been able to reduce the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2. However, few states have demonstrated an ability to maintain R t below one in a statistically significant manner. An uptick of R t around the beginning of May might indicate that political protests or exhaustion for social distancing may be impacting our ability to control COVID-19. While we find that both methods show a drop in R t , we find a significant difference in the timing of R t <1. As noted in Lipsitch et al. 2020 5 , the difference is consequential enough to impact policy decision making, highlighting the importance of method selection for R t estimation. We find that the median difference in timing of R t <1 between the two methods is approximately one week.",
