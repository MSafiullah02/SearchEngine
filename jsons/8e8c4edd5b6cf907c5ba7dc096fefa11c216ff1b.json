A 2010 survey of over 12,000 people from 12 countries reported that 75% of respondents search for health information online [1] , with some two thirds of patients in 2017 reporting that they \"google\" their symptoms before going to the doctor's office [2] . However, online search tools like Google or Bing were not intended to provide medical advice and risk offering irrelevant or misleading information [3] . One potential solution is dedicated symptom assessment applications (i.e. apps) [3] [4] [5] [6] , which use a structured interview or multiple-choice format to ask patients questions about their demographic, relevant medical history, symptoms, and presentation. In the first few screening questions some symptom assessment apps exclude patients from using the tool if they are too young, too old, are pregnant, or have certain comorbidities, limiting the \"coverage\" of the tool. Assuming the patient is not excluded, these software tools use a range of computational approaches to suggest one or more conditions that might explain the symptoms (e.g. common cold vs pneumonia). Many symptom assessment apps then suggest next steps that patients should take (levels of urgency advice, e.g. self-care at home vs seek urgent consultation), often along with evidence-based condition information for the user.",

            "text": "A recent systematic review of the literature identified that rigorous studies are required to show that these apps provide safe and reliable information [4] in the context for which they were designed and for which they have regulatory approval. Most previous studies considered only a single symptom assessment app, focused on specific (often specialty) conditions, had a small number of vignettes (<50), were relatively uncontrolled in the nature of the cases presented, and suffered a high degree of bias [4] . For example, a previous study examined the performance of the Mediktor app in the Emergency Department waiting room [7] . While this is a valid setting, most apps were designed and approved for use primarily at home and for newly presenting problems; accordingly, some 38.7% of patients had to be excluded. Few studies have systematically compared symptom assessment apps to one another in this context, which is particularly important as apps may increasingly be used to supplement or replace telephone triage [4] . This is particularly relevant in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic -early in the spread of COVID-19, healthcare facilities risked being overwhelmed and furthering contagion, so communication strategies were needed to provide patients with advice without face-to-face contact [8, 9] .",

Clinical vignettes are created to represent patients, these are reviewed and then assigned gold-standard answers for main and differential diagnoses and for triage. The clinical vignettes are then used to test both apps and GPs. GPs are assessed through mock telephone consultations and apps through their normal question flow [3, 6] . Clinical vignettes studies have the advantage of enabling direct GP-to-app comparison, allowing a wide range of case types to be explored, and are generalizable to \"real life\" situations, but are complementary to, not a replacement for, real-patient studies [4, 10, 12] . Seminal work at Harvard Medical School has established the value of such approaches but has not been updated recently [3, 6] .",

The vignette creation team also included two GPs (SU and AB -employees of Ada Health), each with over 5 years primary care and emergency department experience. SU and AB had worked for the Ada Health telehealth service Dr Chat but were not involved in the development of Ada's medical intelligence. The vignettes were designed to include both common and lesscommon conditions relevant to primary care practice, and to include clinical presentations and conditions affecting all body systems. They were created to be fair cases representing real-world situations in which a member of the public might seek medical information or advice from a symptom assessment app, or present to primary care. Most of the clinical vignettes were newly presenting problems experienced by an individual or by a child in their care, and they included some patients with chronic conditions, e.g. diabetes, hypertension etc. (see Supplementary   Tables 1 -3 ).",

Another strength of this study is that GPs were tested with vignettes in a manner that simulates real clinical consulting -in this way the GPs consultation process was assessed, enabling a fair comparison to the apps. Vignettes were entered into the apps by 8 additional primary care physicians acting as the user (app-entry-Dr-1 -8). A physician also 'acted' as the patient being assessed by the GPs in the phone-consultations. It has been argued that lay-person entry is closest to the real intended use of symptom assessment apps [25] , however, it is known that lay-people are less reliable at entering clinical-vignettes than health care providers [26] .

A positive step in this direction is the ITU/WHO Focus Group AI for Health (FG-AI4H) through which several manufacturers of symptom assessment apps evaluated in this study are working collaboratively to create standardised app benchmarking with independently curated and globally representative datasets (\"Focus Group on 'Artificial Intelligence for Health,'\" n.d.) [29] . Additional areas that could be explored in such studies are comparative economic impact, understanding user behaviour following an assessment, i.e. compliance with urgency advice (extending the approach of [27] ) and impact on health services usage, and, the impact of using the apps to complement a standard GP consult (e.g. through diagnostic-decision support). While it has been argued that the accuracy of urgency advice may be the most important output from a health assessment app, the condition suggestions may be valuable to support patient decision making [27] . To address the effect of patients entering data directly into an app about their own acute conditions, an observational investigation is currently underway in an acute clinical setting in the US by investigators including co-authors of this study.",
