Yupingfeng San is an ancient herbal medicine in TCM and used to protect lung Qi and avoid pathogenic Qi. In this medicine, there are three herbs: Astragalus, Fangfeng and Atractylodes. Astragalus can improve lung Qi and can reduce phlegm. Fangfeng can relieve the pathogenic Qi, remove dampness and relieve pain. Atractylodes enhances the spleen Qi, which can affect our digestion and absorption. Previous studies has shown that Yupingfeng San could regulate the body's immune function.",

If the lung Qi does not work properly, it will cause lung heat and dampness and some typical symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat and fatigue. So we used the method of \u201cclearing lung heat and dampness\u201d to treat it. Two types of prescriptions, called Sangju yin and Yinqiao san, are commonly used in clinical treatment, and are shown in Table 2\n. The main function of these two prescriptions is to clear lung heat, expel phlegm, relieve cough, regulate the patient's lungs and restore normal lung function. Clinically, we chose Yinqiao san for patients who had high fever and Sangju yin for patients who had severe cough.",
