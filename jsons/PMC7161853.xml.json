            "text": "An examination of the published literature from 1997 to 2004 demonstrates that microarray technology has provided a powerful method for analysis of biological problems. Developmental biologists have measured changes in gene expression in organisms at different developmental stages. Neuroscientists have studied patterns of gene expression in varied areas of the brain before and after specific tasks are performed,and compared transcriptional patterns in pathological (e.g. Alzheimer's) versus nonpathological brains. Molecular biologists have looked at changes in gene expression when specific mutations or gene knockouts were present in an organism. Tissue\u2010specific gene expression patterns in normal kidney and heart have been compared with those found in abnormal pathological conditions such as kidney failure and heart dysfunction. From the study of micropathogenesis to evolution, microarray expression analysis has identified gene candidates and signaling pathways for investigation. Thus, microarray analysis provides interesting leads in almost all fields of biology, offers a genome\u2010wide glimpse into genetic \u201cterra incognita,\u201d and challenges scientists to explore this unknown world.",

            "text": "Some of the most dramatic breakthroughs have been in cancer diagnosis and pathology where microarrays are being used to identify and classify tumors based on their gene expression patterns. Golub et al. did a proof\u2010of\u2010principle study designed to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia from acute lymphoblastic leukemia using patterns of gene expression in patients' bone marrow samples [6]. The study showed that tumor gene profiling correctly identified the cancer type in 36 out of 38 patients, with the remaining two identified as \u201cuncertain.\u201d These scientists suggest that a battery of tumor \u201cclass predictor\u201d genes can be used for diagnostic confirmation or clarification of unusual cases. This point was dramatically illustrated by using the tumor predictors in an actual case in which a boy had classic symptoms of acute leukemia, but his tumor cells had atypical morphology for this disease. Microarray analysis of the boy's tumor cells suggested that he did not have leukemia because there was low expression of leukemia class predictor genes. Instead, the genes expressed suggested muscle cancer. The boy was eventually diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma and his treatment changed accordingly [6]. Because these two types of cancer have quite different treatment modalities, microarray analysis may have saved this boy's life.",

The subgrouping of tumors according to expression patterns has led to optimal treatment modalities with associated lifespan extension. An example of using microarray analyses for the hierarchical clustering of cancer cell types is shown in Fig. 1. The 60 tumor cell lines used by the NCI to screen anti\u2010cancer compounds were classified solely by gene expression patterns. The results reveal a correlation between expression pattern and the cell type from which the tumors originated [8]. Microarray analysis of tumors can be expected to yield significant gains in the future, improving accuracy of disease diagnosis and ensuring the most effective treatment regimen is prescribed for each patient.",

The spotted DNAs are typically oligonucleotides or PCR\u2010amplified cDNA clones. This process is repeated until as many as 30,000 DNA spots are applied to precise locations on the slide. After printing, the DNA is covalently cross\u2010linked to the glass slide. Arrays manufactured by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) use photolithography and solid\u2010phase chemistry to synthesize small oligomers on the surface of a glass slide. For each of the genes being examined, a complementary oligonucleotides is synthesized. In addition, corresponding sets of oligomers are synthesized with known mismatches for the gene sequence. These sets of oligomers offer a measure of binding specificity during hybridization. Unlike some of the array methodologies listed below, Affymetrix arrays compare control and experimental gene expression profiles using two separate arrays, which are scanned separately. The signal from a reference or control is then compared with that of an experimental sample using appropriate software.",

The synthesized oligonucleotides in Affymetrix microarrays are referred to as probes, and the labeled mRNA or cDNA that are hybridized to them are called targets. cDNA arrays are referenced differently, with immobilized cDNA targets, and labeled probes. Differences in nomenclature stem from Southern blotting terminology, where the probe is a known sequence that has been labeled and is hybridized to DNA fragments immobilized on a membrane. For the purpose of this review, and in order to incite the least amount of confusion in our readers, we will refer to the labeled, nonimmobilized mRNA or cDNA as a probe.",

Using supplies and reagents that are certified RNase\u2010free promotes successful RNA isolation.

            "text": "Once extracted from the two populations, the RNA samples are typically labeled with fluorescent dyes in order to generate probes. The commercial cyanine dyes Cy3 and Cy5 are commonly used in labeling reactions. Other dyes, such as Alexa Fluor\u00ae 546 and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), are becoming more popular because the cyanine dyes, especially Cy5, are unstable and susceptible to degradation by ozone, light, and the lasers used in slide scanning. Genisphere Inc. (Hatfield, PA) has recently introduced a new stabilizer specifically to address Cy5 instability. Fluorescently labeled probes can be prepared by several different methods including direct or indirect cDNA labeling, cDNA labeling with fluorescent dendrimers, direct mRNA labeling, and direct or indirect labeling of amplified RNA [5, 10, 13\u201315]. RNA amplification may be the method of choice when isolating RNA from limiting samples, such as those from tissue biopsies. For use in microarray protocols requiring cDNA synthesis, SuperScript II reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) is recommended because it generates high cDNA yields. An alternative enzyme is ImProm\u2010II reverse transcriptase from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). Promega offers a training support program for educators using molecular biology techniques, and many of their products are offered to educators at a discount (contact Diana Long; Fax: 608\u2010277\u20102601).",

            "text": "In the direct cDNA labeling method, fluorescently modified deoxynucleotides are incorporated during the first\u2010strand cDNA synthesis from an RNA template using reverse transcriptase [5, 10, 14]. Although this procedure is relatively straightforward, fluorescently modified nucleotides are bulky and incorporate less efficiently than unmodified nucleotides. In the indirect cDNA labeling method, aminoallyl\u2010modified nucleotides are incorporated during the reverse transcription reaction, and fluorescent dyes are subsequently coupled to the reactive amino groups in the cDNA. Because the amine\u2010modified nucleotides resemble unmodified nucleotides more than the fluorescently labeled nucleotides used for direct labeling, the reverse transcription reaction is more efficient. One disadvantage of the indirect labeling method is that the procedure takes more time to perform. A newer method uses fluorescent dendrimer complexes to label cDNA [13, 14]. After cDNA synthesis, a fluorescent dendrimer with hundreds of dye molecules per complex is hybridized to the cDNA. Genisphere offers discount pricing and other promotions of 3DNA (dendrimer) sample kits with Cy3/Cy5 or Alexa 546/647 dyes to GCAT members, and protocols using 3DNA products are on the GCAT website (http://www.bio.davidson.edu/projects/GCAT/GCATprotocols.html).",

The conditions during this step must be optimized to promote specific binding of labeled probe to its target and reduce background. Important parameters include hybridization temperature, length of hybridization, concentration of salts, pH of the solution, and the presence or absence of denaturants such as formaldehyde in the hybridization buffer. Chips are often prehybridized with a solution containing bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding of labeled probe to the surface. Hybridization and wash solutions must be evenly distributed over the chip to maximize interactions between probe and target sequences and minimize background fluorescence. During hybridization the chips are stored in a humidified, temperature\u2010controlled, darkened environment. Small, affordable, aluminum chambers that house one or two chips work well, and can simply be placed in a standard incubator or water bath during the hybridization steps. These chambers are available from Monterey Industries (Richmond, CA).",

This system is capable of differentiating the fluorescently labeled probes. Most commercially available array scanners scan sequentially, meaning the scanner acquires one image at a time and then builds the ratio image after acquiring images at both fluorescence excitation wavelengths. Other scanners use simultaneous dual laser scanning to acquire both images at the same time, reducing scan times and eliminating potential errors associated with aligning two separately generated images.",

            "text": "After scanning, a grid must be placed on the image and the spots representing the arrayed genes must be identified. The background fluorescence is calculated locally for each spot and is subtracted from the hybridization intensities. Differentially expressed genes are identified by comparing the fluorescence intensity of control and experimental probes hybridized to each spot [11\u201313, 16, 17]. Typically, the experimental target sequences are labeled with Cy5, which fluoresces red light (667 nm), and control targets are labeled with Cy3, which fluoresces green light (568 nm). The ratio of red to green signal can then be used as a measure of the effect of the experimental treatment on the expression of each gene. A ratio of 1 (yellow spot) indicates no change in the expression level between experimental and control samples, while a ratio greater than 1 (red spot) indicates increased transcription in the experimental sample, and a ratio less than 1 (green spot) indicates decreased transcription in the experimental sample. A scatter plot is a very useful representation of the expression data; the signal intensities of the experimental and control samples are plotted along the x\u2010 and y\u2010axes, and the ratio values are plotted as a distance from the diagonal [13]. The diagonal separates spots with higher activity than the control sample from spots with lower activity than the control. The scatter plot provides a visualization of the fluorescence ratios obtained from the experimental and control samples. One can then easily choose points that represent a severalfold increase or decrease in gene expression and focus additional analyses on these genes.",

Normalization of data must be performed to compare separate arrays. With multiple experimental conditions (e.g. time\u2010points or drug doses), the genes are often grouped into clusters that behave similarly under the different conditions. Complex computational methods such as hierarchical clustering or k\u2010means are used to analyze the massive amounts of data generated by these experiments. Gene clusters are visualized with trees or color\u2010coded matrices by placing genes with similar patterns of expression into a clustered group (Fig. 3). Image processing and analysis software is commercially available, and several packages are available as freeware (http://www.bio.davidson.edu/projects/GCAT/GCATprotocols.html, http://www.tigr.org/softlab/, and http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/LCG/15K/HTML/img_analysis.html).

This is especially helpful when some members of the annotated group have been well characterized. Literature searches yield information regarding the role these genes and their protein products play in cell biology, and that information can then be utilized to hypothesize the function of poorly characterized genes placed in the same expression group. For Ceres, this process aids in the identification of genes that might be manipulated to impact specific plant traits.",

Carefully annotated promoters offer pinpoint precision in control of transgene expression. Microarray analyses offer quantitative data on the expression of every known gene in the organism being studied. Researchers can select genes displaying the desired pattern of expression and use the A. thaliana genome information to extract the DNA sequence of the promoter sequence for that gene [24, 25]. That promoter can then be used for the generation of transgenic plants, offering rigid control of the transgene [26]. By comparing the promoters of genes displaying a similar pattern of expression, scientists can identify shared regulatory sequences and use them to custom design a promoter for the chosen application. The information available from a reliable database of gene expression patterns from varied tissues and conditions offers a valuable tool for promoter discovery.",

Microarray analysis of transgenic plants is a very sensitive method of screening for any alterations in plant biology. Similar applications of microarrays are being used in the pharmaceutical industry to determine the influence of a particular drug on cellular function, using the microarray as a critical component in assessing drug toxicity or secondary effect upon cellular function [27]. More traditional analyses focus upon cell survival, or specific physiological characteristics, but these are limited in their ability to detect subtle influences of a drug. Thus, the microarray can be used to compare treated cells (genetically altered, drug treated) with untreated cells and to quantify differences effectively.",

            "text": "There are a growing number of applications for chip technology beyond gene expression analysis. One highly anticipated application has been the rapid determination of genotype using oligonucleotides arrays. Individuals in any population display differences in phenotype (traits), and currently it is very difficult to identify the specific genetic makeup (or genotype) that determines any given phenotype. Ultimately scientists need to follow the segregation of each gene as it passed from one generation to the next, and establish a correlation between traits and the alleles of every gene. Traditional strategies for genotype determination have been laborious and limited, scanning hundreds or a few thousand genetics markers to crudely examine the genotype of each individual at relatively low resolution. The markers being used in these newer genotyping strategies are at the level of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which occur at high frequency in the genome, about every 1,000 base pairs [28]. If all SNPs for each individual in a pedigree could be determined, researchers could follow genetic information at high resolution as it is passed from generation to generation. But determining over a million SNPs for each sample is a daunting task. To offer high\u2010throughput determination of SNPs, oligonucleotide microarrays have been developed for the rapid and accurate analysis of genotype [29\u201332]. Perlegen Sciences (Mountain View, CA) and Affymetrix have collaborated to develop microarrays for the detection of SNPs in humans. Introduced in 2001, the first generation of these tests (GeneChip\u00ae HuSNP) examines 1,500 SNPs for each DNA sample. Using a manufacturing process that has been adapted from the semiconductor industry, Perlegen Sciences is now developing a protocol that will utilize tens of millions of probes on a glass wafer to characterize \u223c1.5 million SNPs for each individual sample (http://www.perlegen.com). Rapid SNP\u2010based genotyping will offer applications in preventive medicine, diagnosis of disease, characterization of complex traits, forensic science, and even the development of effective pharmaceutical treatment of disease [33\u201335].",

More that just a new experimental technique, microarrays employ the massive data generated by genome sequencing and use that data to comparatively examine genome\u2010wide expression patterns. The data sets produced offer a high\u2010resolution map of the genes being regulated to mediate cellular differentiation, adaptation, division, and evolution. This technology is a first glimpse into how researchers will utilize genome data in coming years. Educators are beginning to teach genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics in undergraduate biology and computer science courses and a few, such as those in the GCAT group, are beginning to include these technologies in the teaching laboratory. Far from being just a lesson in new technology, these courses are introducing the new age of biology to the next generation of scientists. It is an exciting, data\u2010rich age in which the entire landscape of experimental possibility has changed. Every graduate pursuing a career in the life sciences will be impacted by these changes, and it is critical that educators begin to develop curriculum accordingly. Biology is indeed being transformed by genomic research, and undergraduate faculty and students need to join the party.",
