It is estimated that a transfusion error occurs about 1:16,000 transfused units, and in the majority of cases it is due to misidentification of the patient. An AB0-incompatible transfusion error will occur 1:33,000 units; 50 % of these will give rise to hemolysis but the mortality incidence due to an incompatible transfusion is calculated as being 1:800,000 [4]. These figures are surely underestimated due to the legal implications of reporting a transfusion-associated mistake. It is interesting to note that the Joint Commission International accreditation system [36] quite rightly consider transfusion errors as \u201csentinel events,\u201d which implies that a thorough root-cause analysis must be performed in the health facility where the event occurs.

Figure 7.1 depicts the main critical points for a safe transfusion. Transfusion requests originate in the ward and clinicians first of all should ask themselves whether their patient does in fact need the transfusion. This means that clinicians should rely on guidelines for which there is a wide consensus on the appropriate use of blood. An important role in this regard is played by the Hospital Transfusion Committee, which is the ideal forum in which these documents are prepared and shared by the hospital medical staff. Clinicians should always bear in mind that the safest transfusion is the one which is not performed. A written request form must be made specifying correct patient data (name, surname, place, and date of birth), condition requiring transfusion, ward, type and number of blood components required, urgency of transfusion, blood group and red blood cell antibody status if previously determined, history of sensitization episodes, previous NIARTs, signature of medical doctor. Fulfilling the request form correctly is the first step toward a safe transfusion. The second step relates to withdrawing blood samples; patient must be identified at the bedside; when possible the patient should be asked his/her name and surname and date of birth, otherwise the patient record must be used. Here again it must be pointed out that many transfusion errors are made at this truly critical point. Traceability (an important ingredient of safety) is enhanced by bar codes on the request form and sample labels. Moreover, as far as AB0 and Rh testing is concerned, it should be performed previous to the request form on a separate blood sample. This is to reduce the risk of mistakes due to swapping of patients. The nurse or medical doctor who withdraws blood should sign the label on blood sample tube to testify that patient identity has been checked.\n\n",

Units are then sent to the ward (in appropriate containers at controlled temperature). Before transfusion, personnel (in Italy a nurse and medical doctor) should check, with the aid of a checklist, the patient\u2019s identity (possibly asking name, surname, and date of birth), blood group on patient record, blood unit label, and transfusion form. This check is pivotal for the safety of transfusion since it is the last chance for a transfusion error to be stopped.

Third, in some cases (patients in intensive care units for example) symptoms may be heavily modified by the patient\u2019s clinical condition (hemoglobinuria may be the only sign of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction in patients under anesthesia). Finally, for reactions occurring at considerable time period from transfusion (post-transfusion purpura, delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion-associated graft vs. host disease), establishing a link between symptoms and the transfusion event may not be so obvious.",

The transfusion center must be promptly informed and a blood sample together with the remains of the transfusion unit must be sent to the transfusion center together with a description of signs and symptoms (on transfusion form). Treatment must be started immediately and specialized opinion may be sought from an intensive care unit specialist or from a nephrologists or other specialist. A synthesis of the most important therapeutic and preventive strategies for immunologic NIARTs is shown in Table 7.9. Data regarding any NIART should be registered on the patient\u2019s medical record for future preventive measures.\n",

As we all know, a \u201czero risk\u201d transfusion does not exist and thus risk management systems must be implemented since knowing the extent of risk is the first step for controlling it. This means that statistics must be prepared on all types of NIARTs and discussed at the Transfusion Committee. One of the obstacles that prevent NIARTs from being successfully managed is underreporting; this is due to underrecognition in the ward but also due to a reticence from clinicians who may be worried that, for example, a transfusion error may lead to legal problems. An anonymous form for adverse event reporting must be available in the wards. Clinicians must feel adequately supported by the transfusion laboratory which must perform all necessary tests in a timely manner. The final word goes to training; continuous updating and \u201crefresher\u201d courses should be given to both nurses and doctors working at the patient\u2019s bedside as well as to personnel working in transfusion centers to allow prompt recognition, laboratory diagnosis, effective treatment, and implementation of prevention strategies in order to guarantee an as-safe-as-possible transfusion for our patients.",
