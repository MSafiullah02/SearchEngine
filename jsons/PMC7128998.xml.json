Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated the existence of two genetic subgroups of hMPV, exemplified by the Canadian strains CAN97\u201083 (genotype 1) and CAN98\u201075 (genotype 2) [3]. By analogy with hRSV, it was assumed that these distinct genetic lineages would represent different antigenic subgroups. However, it has been shown that the two hMPV genetic groups are highly related antigenically, and that the fusion protein is a major contributor to this antigenic relatedness [4]. No zoonotic source for hMPV is known, despite similarities between hMPV and avian pneumovirus type C [2, 5]. Infection appears to be seasonal, and resembles that caused by hRSV in that it occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in the winter months [2, 6, 7].",

Two of the four patients (Table 1; patients 2 and 4) had clinical presentations consistent with upper RTI, but without radiological evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. Patient 4 was lymphocytopenic (absolute lymphocyte count < 300/mm3) following treatment with alemtuzumab for refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Patients 1 and 3 had radiological evidence suggestive of lower RTI.

In other studies, hMPV was the sole pathogen detected in three patients with underlying acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who presented with RTIs and subsequently died [10, 11, 27]. However, another hMPV\u2010infected immunocompromised child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia recovered without specific antiviral treatment [13].

The frequency of hMPV infection in hospitalised children was reported as 5.5% in one study, with hMPV\u2010positive children presenting with mild\u2010to\u2010severe RTIs [13]. Furthermore, other data indicate that hMPV accounts for at least 5\u20137% of RTIs in hospitalised children [26]. Specimens, including BALs, collected in the present study were obtained in the same period as BALs from Irish adults with hMPV\u2010associated infections. Improper storage of the specimens from children is very unlikely. Retrospective testing for hRSV by RT\u2010PCR using 66 of the stored specimens proved more sensitive than biological methods (18.1% vs. 12%; results not shown). Furthermore, known hMPV\u2010positive NPAs from a hospital in the UK were used successfully as positive controls, even though the specimens had been frozen and thawed on at least two occasions. An underestimation of the percentage of hMPV\u2010positive samples was observed when only specimens negative for other respiratory viruses were tested for hMPV [17]. It is also possible that a new lineage of hMPV, not amplified by the primers used for RT\u2010PCR, could have caused RTIs in young Irish children. However, phylogenetic analysis of the hMPV isolates from the four adult Irish patients showed that the circulating strains in 2003\u20132004 belonged to the well\u2010recognised 1B lineage. It is also possible that the occurrence of hMPV shows a seasonal variation, perhaps with sporadic epidemics. Temporal variation in the pattern of hMPV infection has been demonstrated in young and elderly adults, with hMPV illness rates of 1.5% and 7.0% in the winter seasons of 1999\u20132000 and 2000\u20132001, respectively [9]. Furthermore, another study [19] showed that the incidence of hMPV infection in infants varied substantially from season to season over a 3\u2010year period, with a positivity rate of 7% in 2001, compared to 40% in 2000 and 2002.",
