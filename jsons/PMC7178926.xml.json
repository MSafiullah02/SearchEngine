In 1973, researchers at Osaka University led by Tadamitsu Kishimoto first reported that a soluble factor secreted by T cells was important for antibody production by B cells (Fig. 1); subsequently, this soluble factor was cloned as IL-6, which turned out to have various roles in several autoimmune diseases1,2. At the same time, researchers at Chugai Pharmaceutical were exploring new avenues for drug development for autoimmune diseases. In the late 1980s, the two groups started to collaborate to further advance the understanding of the biological role of IL-6 in various autoimmune diseases and the development of IL-6 inhibitors as treatment options. To increase their collaborative potential, the two research groups even moved to adjoining laboratories at Osaka University. The university researchers led efforts to identify IL-6 signalling mechanisms and the biological effects of IL-6, whereas the company focused on developing and characterizing IL-6 inhibitors as potential new treatments for autoimmune diseases3\u20135.",

            "text": "The traditional approach of searching for small-molecule inhibitors proved challenging when the research team found that IL-6 signal transduction occurred through a hexameric high-affinity complex of IL-6, IL-6R and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) (Fig. 2a). Moreover, both soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound IL-6R (mIL-6R) can be part of the hexameric complex; hence, the binding region of IL-6\u2013IL-6R\u2013gp130 was considered too complex and broad for a small-molecule compound to inhibit the IL-6 signal pathway6,7. The aforementioned mIL-6R and sIL-6R forms are associated with so-called classical signalling and trans-signalling pathways, respectively, the details of which and corresponding avenues for drug development have been reviewed extensively elsewhere4. Both signalling routes involve phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which can also be targeted therapeutically with different molecules but are not the focus of this article4. The decision to target IL-6R rather than IL-6 itself was made, taking into consideration that concentrations of the receptor have less interpatient variability than concentrations of IL-6, potentially simplifying dose and regimen selection8,9. With concurrent advances in biotechnology, the two groups decided to develop a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6R10\u201312. The resulting humanized antibody to IL-6R, tocilizumab, binds to mIL-6R and sIL-6R and inhibits IL-6 signalling by preventing IL-6 from binding to IL-6R11,12. The therapeutic benefit of this antibody to IL-6R led to the development of several antibodies to IL-6 (sirukumab, olokizumab and clazakizumab).",

Although none of the patients treated had an improved outcome or achieved remission in the initial report of the trial, post-hoc analysis revealed that treatment with the anti-IL-6 showed some efficacy in those patients who produced low concentrations of IL-6 (ref.15). More than 20 years later, a clinical trial evaluated whether the addition of a different chimeric monoclonal antibody to IL-6, siltuximab, to the bortezomib\u2013melphalan\u2013prednisone regimen would be beneficial to patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; however, this IL-6 inhibitor also failed to improve outcomes16.",

In a 1994 case report, administration of a mouse neutralizing antibody to IL-6 to a patient with Castleman disease seemed to be therapeutically effective20. Tocilizumab also had positive effects in a small case series of seven patients in 2000 and in a multicentre, prospective, open-label study in 2005 that included 28 patients with Castleman disease21,22. In the prospective study, bi-weekly treatment with tocilizumab consistently alleviated lymphadenopathy and improved all inflammatory parameters over 60 weeks22. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of siltuximab also showed efficacy in this indication23. Subsequently, tocilizumab was approved for the treatment of Castleman disease in Japan and siltuximab was approved for this indication in various countries.",

On the basis of these observations, tocilizumab was evaluated in a placebo-controlled phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) with patients with active Crohn\u2019s disease (defined as a Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index score of \u2265150 (ref.25)). The primary end point, a reduction of the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index score of \u226570 points, was met by 80% of the patients who received bi-weekly tocilizumab, compared with 31% of the placebo-treated patients, demonstrating the substantial efficacy of tocilizumab. However, the development of tocilizumab for Crohn\u2019s disease did not proceed owing to rare reports of gastrointestinal perforations observed in concurrent clinical trials in arthritis and because of an increased understanding of the homeostatic role of IL-6 in the intestinal epithelium26. Together, these findings suggested that patients with Crohn\u2019s disease might be at increased risk of potential detrimental effects of IL-6 inhibition.",

            "text": "The development path for an IL-6 inhibitor for the treatment of RA, the most common chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints, began in the early 1990s, when cell-based experiments revealed that IL-6 might be involved in osteoporosis, cartilage destruction and synovial inflammation associated with RA27\u201330. In mouse models of collagen-induced and antigen-induced arthritis, IL-6 inhibition prevented the development of arthritis but did not ameliorate arthritis once the disease was established31\u201333. In a 1993 study, the administration of a mouse monoclonal antibody to IL-6 to patients with RA resulted in improvements of disease symptoms and laboratory measures of disease activity, although the effects were transient34. In 2000, the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab was investigated in a case series of 11 patients with refractory RA; the treatment was well tolerated and led to both clinical and biochemical improvements35. On the basis of these results, larger and confirmatory double-blind RCTs of tocilizumab were conducted in patients with refractory RA36\u201340. Tocilizumab improved clinical signs and symptoms of RA, laboratory parameters and radiological manifestations and also ameliorated the effects of RA on patient-reported outcomes, activities of daily living and quality of life, when administered as monotherapy or in combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)41\u201345. These and other studies led to tocilizumab receiving marketing authorization (Fig. 1) for patients with early RA who were not previously treated with methotrexate and those with established RA and an inadequate response to previous treatment with DMARDs or TNF antagonists; in these patients, tocilizumab is administered in combination with methotrexate or as monotherapy if methotrexate is not tolerated or continued treatment with methotrexate is not appropriate.",

In particular, a head-to-head, double-blind, double-dummy RCT found that, when used as monotherapy, tocilizumab was superior to the TNF inhibitor adalimumab in measures of disease activity and several other outcomes46. On the basis of these results, EULAR recommendations for the management of RA named IL-6 pathway inhibitors as one of the preferred treatment options for patients for whom methotrexate is inappropriate60. Interestingly, the clinical benefits of IL-6 inhibition might be attributable, in part, to the beneficial effects of IL-6 inhibition on bone and cartilage turnover, which are supported by data from prospective cohort studies showing that tocilizumab monotherapy achieves better repair of focal bone erosions than TNF inhibition in patients with RA60\u201370. Besides promoting joint inflammation and damage through effects on chondrocytes, osteoclasts, macrophages and fibroblasts, IL-6 mediates systemic inflammation in RA. IL-6 affects T cell and B cell differentiation and is the key driver of the acute-phase response in RA. Key symptoms and comorbidities such as pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, anaemia and cardiovascular disease can be mediated by IL-6 (refs71,72), as shown in Fig. 2c.",

JIA exists as several different subtypes: oligoarticular JIA, polyarticular JIA, juvenile psoriatic arthritis (PsA), enthesitis-related arthritis and systemic JIA (sJIA). In sJIA, arthritis is associated with prominent systemic features, including high spiking fever, rash, serositis and inflammatory signs. This disease is further characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates, joint destruction, functional disability and growth retardation80. Concentrations of IL-6 are markedly elevated in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with sJIA, and a vast body of evidence from cell-based experiments and animal models demonstrates that IL-6 overproduction seems to explain most, if not all, of the clinical and laboratory features of the disease including fever spikes, acute-phase response, anaemia, growth retardation and systemic osteoporosis81\u201385. In 2005, clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with sJIA conducted in the UK and Japan provided proof of principle of the efficacy of IL-6 inhibition in this severe paediatric condition86,87. Two subsequent trials of tocilizumab in >150 children with sJIA confirmed extensive improvements in the signs and symptoms of disease following treatment with tocilizumab and demonstrated the clinically relevant glucocorticoid-sparing potential of IL-6 inhibition88\u201392. The efficacy and safety of IL-6 inhibition in sJIA have also been confirmed in real-world studies93. Reversal of sJIA-associated growth retardation has also been demonstrated with IL-6 inhibition, with patients experiencing catch-up growth during treatment with tocilizumab92.",

Levels of antibodies to double-stranded DNA decreased even after adjustment for the decrease in total IgG titres following tocilizumab treatment112. These changes, together with a decrease in the frequency of circulating plasma cells, suggested a specific effect of IL-6 inhibition on autoantibody-producing B cells. However, further studies with sirukumab did not demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit of IL-6 pathway inhibition in patients with lupus nephritis or SLE114,115.

A detailed representation of all of these studies is beyond the scope of this article, but briefly, they encompass conditions such as uveitis, thyroid eye disease, neuromyelitis optica, graft-versus-host disease, erosive hand osteoarthritis, various oncological indications, depression, schizophrenia, Schnitzler syndrome, myocardial infarction, familial Mediterranean fever and COVID-19 pneumonia (caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2)5,139,140. The potential of IL-6 pathway inhibition in COVID-19 pneumonia is supported by studies in which elevated concentrations of IL-6 have been reported, together with several laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hyperinflammation, especially in patients admitted to intensive care units141. A phase II trial is ongoing in Italy142 and, in March 2020, a phase III trial was approved by the FDA143 to assess the effect of tocilizumab for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. It is hoped that findings from some of these studies will expand the application and medical value of IL-6 pathway inhibition to additional diseases in the future.",

IL-6 pathway inhibitors have shown benefit in patients with RA, JIA, AOSD, GCA, Castleman disease and CRS and might also be beneficial in patients with other autoimmune diseases and even beyond. However, the limitations of preclinical studies for predicting clinical success in patients is a major barrier and necessitates early human proof-of-concept studies. Case reports or series have proved useful in some conditions such as GCA, Takayasu arteritis, AOSD and CRS. In the future, trials to assess the efficacy and safety of a specific treatment within a biomarker-positive subgroup in heterogeneous patient populations (for example, a basket trial) to confirm and generate hypotheses might be an option. However, a reliable biomarker for predicting treatment response in many rheumatic diseases has not been identified.",

Answering these questions would help to further progress our understanding of how various autoimmune diseases are regulated in the context of IL-6 pathway biology and would help in developing additional, personalized treatment options for individual patients or patient subgroups.

Both membrane-bound IL-6R and soluble IL-6R can be part of the hexameric complex and are associated with the classical signalling and trans-signalling pathways, respectively. Intracellular signalling pathways involve the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Pharmacological inhibitors of IL-6 signalling prevent IL-6 from binding to IL-6R by targeting either the cytokine itself or the receptor. b | In the context of disease, IL-6 can have both local inflammatory and systemic effects. Some of the manifestations of the diseases for which IL-6 inhibitors are approved could be explained by the effects of IL-6, on the basis of both preclinical and clinical data. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), Castleman disease, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis and cytokine release syndrome, among others. c | As IL-6 has multiple roles in the dysfunction of the immune and inflammatory systems, anti-IL-6R therapy could relieve various symptoms such as fever, fatigue, pain, joint destruction, anaemia and others.
