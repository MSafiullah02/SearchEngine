The criteria for diagnosis of OME included the presence of effusion behind an intact eardrum as determined by pneumatic otoscopy for at least 1 month, subsequently confirmed by tympanostomy, without signs and symptoms of acute infection. In children with bilateral involvement, MEE was collected only from the right ear. Children who had purulent MEE or those who had received antimicrobial therapy or experienced upper respiratory tract infections within 1 week before the study were not included. The duration of OME was based in each case on the clinical follow-up data recorded by the patient\u2019s physicians. The patients were enrolled in the study after informed consent had been obtained from the parents. All received general anesthesia for the procedure.",

Briefly, RNA was extracted by using matrix affinity chromatography (QIAamp blood kit; QIAGEN, Chatsworth, Calif). Reverse transcription was carried out in 21 \u03bcL volume with virus-specific oligonucleotide primers (HRV, 5\u2032-GCACTTCTGTTICCCC-3\u2032; RSV, 5\u2032-TTTGTTATAGGCATATCATTG-3\u2032; HCV 229E, 5\u2032GGTACTCCTAAGCCTTCTCG-3\u2032; HCV OC43 5\u2032-AGGAAGGTCTGCTCCTAATTC-3\u2032). After reverse transcription (MMLV-RT; Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md) reactions, the samples were heated to inactivate the transcriptase at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes and mixed with 24 \u03bcL of 5\u2032-biotinylated primer (HRV, 5\u2032- CGGACACCCAAAGTAG-3\u2032; RSV, 5\u2032-TTAACCAGCAAAGTGTTAGA-3\u2032; HCV 229E, 5\u2032-GACTATCAAACAGCATAGCAGC-3\u2032; HCV OC 43, 5\u2032-GCAAAGATGGGGAACTGTGG-3\u2032) and 5.8 \u03bcL of PCR buffer K (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif) to adjust the final concentrations of primers and MgCl2 to 0.8 \u03bcmol/L and 2.7 mmol/L, respectively, and the final pH to 9.0. While tubes were held at 80\u00b0C, 1.25 U of Taq Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) diluted in 5 \u03bcL of water was added, and 35 cycles of PCR of denaturation (1 minute at 95\u00b0C for HRV; 2 minutes at 95\u00b0C for HCV and RSV), annealing (1.5 minutes at 48.2\u00b0C for HRV; 1 minute at 60\u00b0C for HCV; 1 minute at 52\u00b0C for RSV), DNA synthesis (1 minute at 72\u00b0C), and extension 10 minutes at 72\u00b0C. Rhinovirus type 39 (ATCC, Rockville, Md), RSV, HCV 229E (provided by Kathryn V. Holmes, University of Colorado), and OC43 (ATCC) were used as positive controls; and sterile PBS was used as negative control in each reaction series. Unincorporated primers and deoxyribonucloside triphosphates were removed from PCR products by SELECT-B spin column (5Prime-3Prime, Boulder, Colo).

Recently, it has been shown that children prone to OME tend to have more frequent discrete episodes of effusions rather than increased overall duration of episodes.20 Unfortunately, our study did not incorporate the simultaneous collection of nasopharyngeal samples to examine for presence of infection at that level of the respiratory tract. Of note, PCR-based amplification techniques can detect the presence of bacterial DNA in a significant percentage of bacterially culture-negative MEEs in children.3, 4 In the middle ear cavities of experimentally infected chinchillas, purified bacterial DNA and DNA from intact but nonviable bacteria do not persist in MEE, although antibiotic-treated bacteria can persist in some viable state for weeks.21 In contrast, it is not known how long viral RNA can remain in MEE or mucosa without being degraded. In separate studies we found that HRV RNA is detectable by RT-PCR only up to 3 days longer than by culture in nasal washings of experimentally infected adults (Pitk\u00e4ranta A, unpublished observations, 1997). However, the duration of HRV persistence in the nasopharynx may differ from that in the middle ear, and the duration of shedding may be shorter in adults than in children, in part because of differences in immune competence. In order to address indirectly the question of HRV persistence in MEE, we collected HRV-negative MEEs and added large amounts of infectious HRV to determine the durability of infectivity and RNA detectability by our assays. Although cultivable virus was lost rapidly in MEE, RNA detectability persisted for 35 days in one experiment and for 8 weeks in another. These in vitro studies raise the question of whether RNA detected in MEEs sometimes represents residual viral RNA in the thick effusion. However, our results (5/19 culture-positive MEEs) and previous findings of HRV culture-positive MEE samples6 clearly indicate active HRV infection in some children. Whether this represents chronic or recurrent infection remains to be determined. Direct demonstration of viral replication in situ or amelioration of the condition by specific antiviral therapy would provide evidence for productive viral infection in the middle ear.",

Although the mechanisms are not defined, earlier studies showed that co-infection with rhinovirus and bacteria was an indicator for failure of resolution of AOM during antibiotic treatment.22, 23 These findings support the concept that respiratory viruses, either alone or in combination with bacteria, are commonly associated with OME. Viral infection can cause obstruction of eustachian tube and abnormalities of middle ear pressure during both experimentally induced24 and natural HRV infections.25 This may in turn cause impaired drainage of the middle ear and represent one possible mechanism contributing to the development of OME. Changes in local immune responses in the middle ear may be another contributory factor, particularly when secondary bacterial infection occurs,11 although the mechanism is not clear.",
