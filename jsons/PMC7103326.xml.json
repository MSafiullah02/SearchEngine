            "text": "Our method of developing replicon constructs was based on the strategy previously used to assemble the full-length cDNA construct SARS\u2013CoV (Yount et al., 2003). The strategy for the construction of the replicon is illustrated in Fig. 1\n. Viral envelope-protein coding genes S, E and M were excluded from the replicon to disable virion synthesis, production and secretion. The nucleocapsid gene, N, was retained because the nucleocapsid protein has been shown to be required for viral RNA synthesis (Almazan et al., 2004, Hertzig et al., 2004) and that the sequence involved in the regulation of the expression of a coronavirus 3\u2032-proximal gene is more than \u223c 50 nt upstream of the gene (Alonso et al., 2002, Jeong et al., 1996). Therefore, to achieve relatively native expression of N gene from the replicon, a region \u223c 60 nt upstream of N ORF was included in the replicon. The green fluorescent protein\u2013blasticidin deaminase fusion (GFP\u2013BlaR) gene was also included into the replicon to enable easy selection and detection of replicon-containing cells. GFP\u2013BlaR gene was inserted between ORF 1 and N, not at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the replicon, in order to minimize any possible deleterious effect in the synthesis of replicon RNA. The expression of GFP\u2013BlaR was driven by the transcription regulatory sequence of ORF S, which was included in the replicon and occurring at a position right upstream of the GFP\u2013BlaR gene. Following this strategy, six cDNA subclones that span the SARS\u2013CoV genome were used in the assembly of recombinant SARS\u2013CoV replicon cDNA. The green fluorescent protein\u2013blasticidin deaminase fusion (Gb) gene was amplified from the plasmid pTracer\u2122-CMV/Bsd/LacZ using PCR and included into the replicon constructs. In addition, the cDNAs constructed were flanked by restriction sites that leave unique interconnecting junctions of 3 or 4 nts in length (SapI or BsaI). As these sticky ends are not complementary to the majority of other sticky ends, which are generated by the same enzyme at other sites in the DNA, replicon cDNAs can be systematically assembled by in vitro ligation.",

As shown in Fig. 2C, the average green fluorescence intensity value of SRC-1 culture remained at a constant level and was in excess of that of the parent BHK-21 culture. These results were consistent when compared to previous findings (Hertzig et al., 2004). Hertzig et al. (2004) analyzed the GFP expression of HCoV 229E replicon cells by flow cytometry for a period of 4 months (over 50 passages under G418 selection) and they showed that the percentage of green fluorescent cells remained at a constant level of 40\u201360% throughout this period. Thus, these data indicate that although replicon cells may express sufficient GFP\u2013BlaR to survive blasticidin selection, the amount of GFP BlaR protein was insufficient to be detected by flow cytometry. A possible cause for differential GFP BlaR protein expression in replicon cells is the efficiency of functional replicon RNA uptake during transfection. Thus, this analysis shows that the SARS\u2013CoV replicon persists efficiently and grows consistently in the cells under selection for substantial periods of time and would be suitable to use for anti-SARS drug screening purposes. Furthermore, SCR-1 cells that have been stored for 1 month in liquid nitrogen and re-cultured still displayed green fluorescence indistinguishable from cells that have been passaged continuously (data not shown). Subsequent passage of cell culture supernatants onto BHK-21 cells also did not result in either blasticidin resistance or GFP expression, thus demonstrating that the replicon particles are not released by passaging supernatants into fresh cultures.",

At passage number  40, the RNA from SCR-1 cells was purified and examined again by sequence analysis. At this later passage, three nucleotide changes were detected that resulted in three amino acids changes: two in ORF 1 and one in N gene (Table 1\n). Since these nucleotide changes were not encoded by the cloned cDNA and no adaptive mutations had occurred in the early passage, these three mutations, most likely, have been acquired during replication in the later passage. It remains important to elucidate whether the mutations facilitate efficient replication of replicon RNA in SCR-1.",

The compounds were applied in different concentrations on SCR-1 cells and GFP expression was monitored by flow cytometry analysis, fluorescent microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR 3 days later. Untreated cells served as controls and the cytotoxic effect of each compound was assessed in parallel on parental BHK-21 cells. As shown in Fig. 3\n, incubation of SCR-1 cells with E64-d at 0.4 mg/ml reduced not only the level of reporter gene expression and the copy number of replicon RNA but also the overall percentage of green fluorescent cells. Importantly, no cytotoxicity of E64-d was observed at or near inhibitory concentrations. Ribavirin showed low inhibitory activity at the concentration of 0.4 mg/mL and significant cytotoxic effects were observed at higher concentration, 0.5\u20135 mg/mL. As such, Ribavirin was considered to be inactive against SARS\u2013CoV replication. Glycyrrhizin showed low inhibitory effect at the concentration of 2 mg/mL. These results indicate that the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64-d appears to represent a promising candidate for the inhibition of SARS\u2013CoV replicase function. On the other hand, the therapeutic efficacy of the other drugs may be limited because of their low specific inhibitory effect and significant cytotoxicity. Taken together, these results show that the replicon cell lines thus developed would be useful for anti-SARS drug screening and will provide a tool to study candidate anti-SARS agents.",

Baric's group constructed a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replicon for the expression of heterologous GFP gene (Curtis et al., 2002) and Thiel's group generated a non-cytopathic, selectable replicon RNA (based on HCoV 229E) for the identification of coronavirus replicase inhibitors (Hertzig et al., 2004). Nevertheless, the genomic sequence data of SARS\u2013CoV reveal that this novel agent did not belong to any of the known groups of coronaviruses, including two human coronaviruses, HcoV OC43 and HcoV 229E (Peiris et al., 2003a, Drosten et al., 2003). Therefore, despite the presence of functional replicon RNA assays (Hertzig et al., 2004), there is a need for the development of SARS\u2013CoV replicon cell lines, which would allow a rapid and safe identification of inhibitors that are specific for SARS\u2013CoV.",

For glycyrrhizin, the variation in results obtained in this study as compared to previously published results may be due to assay conditions including virus strain, detection method and compound concentration and handling (Cinatl et al., 2003). Notably, other independent groups also observed the lack of anti-SARS\u2013CoV activity of glycyrrhizin (Hertzig et al., 2004).

Ribavirin (ICN Pharma) was also used as it represents a widely used class of nucleoside analogs, which inhibits viral polymerases (So et al., 2003). SCR-1 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 \u03bcg/mL blasticidin. The culture media was removed after a 1-day incubation when the cells reached 80\u201390% confluence and replaced by fresh medium without blasticidin. Graded doses of drugs were added on monolayers of SCR-1 cells and an untreated well was served as control. Three days later, the cells were harvested and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Four duplicate tests were performed. Inhibition of reporter gene expression was calculated as reduction of the fluorescence intensity of GFP-positive cells by setting the fluorescence intensity of untreated SRC-1 cells at 100%. In parallel, the cytotoxicity of drugs was assayed on BHK-21 cells using CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kits (Promega).",

Real-time PCR signals were analyzed using the LightCycler software (Roche; version 5.32), and the sizes and uniqueness of PCR products were verified by performing both melting curves and agarose gel electrophoresis. The copy number of replicon RNA was determined by direct comparison with the internal standards. Replicon RNA expression levels are expressed as number of copies/\u03bcg total RNA.
