The forward primer was 5\u2032-TCTCTACATATGAAAAGCCAAGTTGCTGATAA-3\u2032 (the NdeI restriction site is underlined), and the reverse primer was 5\u2032-CACTGACTCGAGTGACTTGTTCAAGGCAGGAG-3\u2032 (the XhoI restriction site is underlined). The amplified vlsE1 and the pTYB2 vector were digested with NdeI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) and purified using a QIAquick kit (Qiagen). Ligation of vlsE1 into the pTYB2 plasmid vector resulted in an in-frame gene fusion in which the 5\u2032 end encoded an intein (protein-splicing element). A 5-kDa chitin-binding domain is encoded on the C terminus of the intein, which allows affinity purification of the 3-part fusion sequence (pTYB2-vlsE1). DNA sequencing confirmed that the construct was complete, in the proper reading frame, and identical to the published sequence of vlsE allele 1 [30]. pTYB2-vlsE1 was transformed into the protease-deficient Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Novagen). The recombinant fusion protein was expressed as follows: A fresh E. coli colony was inoculated in 1 L of Luria-Bertani broth (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract [both from Difco], and 10 g of NaCl per liter) containing 250 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin (Novagen), and the culture was incubated with shaking at 37\u00b0C until it reached an OD600 of 0.6. Recombinant protein synthesis was induced by the addition of 0.3 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside (Boehringer Mannheim), the culture was incubated for 6 h at 25\u00b0C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 10 mL of ice-cold column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 500 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100; Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM Pefabloc SC (Boehringer Mannheim), a protease inhibitor, and lysed by sonication on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 250,000 g. Clarified supernatant was decanted, and rVlsE1 was purified at 4\u00b0C using the IMPACT system, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the presence of dithiothreitol, the intein undergoes specific self-cleavage that releases the target protein from the chitin-bound intein tag, resulting in a single-column purification of the target protein",

A control standardization was performed for a given plate by plotting the slope of its control serum samples against the mean slope for each of the 4 control serum samples from all other plates of the same assay (the number of reference plates was 24 or 25, depending on the assay). A regression line was fit to these data, and the resulting slope and intercept were used to calibrate all the individual test slopes on that plate. The coefficient of determination, r2, was computed as a measure of fit for all regressions. Duplicates of the calibrated slopes were then averaged, and these averages were considered to be comparable for subsequent receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. This standardization and calibration scheme may be described formally as follows: Let Xi,j be the jth sample on the ith plate. And let Ci,k represent the kth control sample, for k=1, 2, 3, 4, on the ith plate, for i=1, 2, \u2026, x number of plates. For each plate, fit a linear model Ci,k=bi+miC-i,k+ei,k, where C-i,k is the mean of the kth control over all plates but the ith and ei,k is an error term. Numerical values of bi and mi for the model were obtained by least squares analysis. Statistical computations were performed using S-Plus 6.1 Professional (Insightful).

All statistical comparisons were based on a type I error rate of 0.05 (\u03b1=0.05)",

Seventy-seven of these were from 40 patients with early Lyme disease, including 74 paired acute- and convalescent-phase samples and 3 additional early samples (1 acute-phase sample and 2 convalescent-phase samples, all 3 unpaired). All paired serum samples were from patients with erythema migrans (EM), in most cases accompanied by clinical evidence of disseminated infection (37 of 40 patients). In 16 of the 37 patients with disseminated infection, multiple sites of EM were present. Other evidence of disseminated infection in patients with EM included headache, stiff neck, and arthralgia, as described elsewhere [40]. Each of the 37 patients had received antibiotic therapy starting on the date on which the first serum sample was obtained. The length of time between EM onset, as reported by patients, and initiation of medical treatment varied from 1 to 8 weeks. This distribution in the duration of infection permitted study of the time course of development of seroreactivity. The median interval between collection of the acute- and convalescent-phase specimens was 18 days (mean interval, 19 days; SD, 7.7 days; range, 8\u201343 days). Twenty additional samples were from 20 patients with early neuroborreliosis, of which 15 were from persons with acute early neurologic disease and were obtained before antibiotic treatment. Of these 15 patients, 10 had meningitis, 8 had facial palsy, and 3 had radiculoneuropathy. The remaining 5 samples were obtained from treated patients during convalescence. The presenting signs in these patients before treatment were meningitis (4 of 5), facial palsy (1 of 5), and radiculoneuropathy (2 of 5). Most patients with early neuroborreliosis (18 of 20) had a history of EM. Forty-nine samples were from patients with Lyme arthritis, all of whom had intermittent objective swelling of \u2a7e1 joint (28 samples were obtained before antibiotic treatment, 5 were obtained from patients who had joint inflammation despite prior antibiotic treatment, and 16 were obtained during convalescence). Eight samples were from individuals with late-stage neurologic disease (7 of the 8 patients had encephalopathy, 3 had polyneuropathy, and 7 had received antibiotic therapy for EM and/or Lyme arthritis previously). For late disease, the case definition requires at least 1 late manifestation and laboratory confirmation of infection [39], and therefore the possibility of selection bias toward reactive samples cannot be discounted",

OspC was the most frequently reactive protein (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the well-known ability of OspC to elicit a vigorous IgM response in early Lyme disease [49, 50]. Furthermore, an immunodominant peptide has been defined at the C terminus of OspC that is substantially conserved in sequence among European strains of B. garinii [19]. Our examination of OspC sequences deposited in GenBank confirms and extends the observation of Mathiesen et al. [19] that this epitope has little polymorphism. In particular, the PKKP-COOH motif is invariant in 96% of isolates (127 of 132) of B. burgdorferi sensu lato of medical importance for which the full C-terminal sequence has been reported. Therefore, we investigated whether IgM responses to this peptide could improve the performance of serologic testing for exposure to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in the United States when scored in parallel with VlsE-based assays for IgG antibodies",

In addition, the kELISA system allows for calibration of data from plate to plate by use of a standard curve using control serum samples (4 controls in duplicate on each plate in this study). This calibration corrects for variability in experimental conditions, such as ambient temperature. The slope of each control is plotted against the mean control slope from all other plates of a similar antigen. The r2 of the resulting regression line serves as a measure of assay quality and yields a slope and an intercept for adjustment of the sample raw slopes.

After a substantial number of samples had been tested (n=428), slopes were calculated using only the first 5 readings (10 min), and the results were compared by ROC analysis with those obtained when all 15 readings (30 min) were used (data not shown). The empirical ROC curves and their AUCs were indistinguishable (0.91 and 0.92, respectively). On the basis of this finding and the logistical benefit of a shorter reading time, we used 10 min of data collection for this and all subsequent assays. Final comparison between 10-min and 30-min rVlsE1 IgG kELISA slopes with all 839 serum samples tested revealed a minor increase in sensitivity with 30 min of reading (0.675 [95% CI, 0.618\u20130.727], compared with 0.657 [95% CI, 0.559\u20130.710] for 10-min data). The only disagreements in test outcome were observed with 5 early convalescent serum samples that were negative at 10 min and positive at 30 min.

The best tests were rVlsE1 IgG \u222a pepC10 IgM and C6 IgG \u222a pepC10 IgM. The improvement in test sensitivities over 2-tiered analysis was greatest in early acute Lyme disease. The choice of whether to use rVlsE1 or C6 peptide in an IgG kinetic assay is not clear-cut on the grounds of performance alone. There is some evidence that rVlsE1 is more sensitive than C6 for detecting antibody in the serum of patients with neurologic disease, but this observation must be verified with a larger number of samples and in prospective studies. The C6 assay offers the advantages that peptides commonly have over proteins expressed in E. coli namely, comparative ease of synthesis of a product of high purity (and presumably lower cost) and high assay signal-to-noise ratio. Both rVlsE1 IgG \u222a pepC10 IgM and C6 IgG \u222a pepC10 IgM kELISAs can be fully automated, fairly easily standardized, and objectively interpreted. A proper comparison of the performance of these tests would evaluate their performance using serum samples other than those on which the criteria for positivity were derived. To this end, prospective studies are in progress to assess these tests as they would be used in clinical practice",
