Unlike free-living bacteria, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, utilise the host cell machinery to propagate new viruses and can cause ailments as benign as a common wart, as irritating as a cold, or as deadly as the bloody African fever. Hence, the viruses can be termed as the \u2018acellular parasites of cellular hosts\u2019\n[1]. Viruses have numerous invasion strategies and each strain has its own unique configuration of surface molecules 2, 3, enabling them to enter into host cells by precisely fitting their surface molecules with the molecules of target cell. For example, the viruses that cause Lassa and Ebola fever and AIDS spread easily, kill swiftly and have no cure or vaccine. Each strain of virus is unique in its surface antigenic structure, its receptors on host cells and its life cycle. As a consequence of genetic variation, variety in mode of transmission, efficient replication and the ability to persist within the host, viruses have adapted to all forms of life and have occupied numerous ecological niches resulting in widespread diseases in humans, livestock and plants 2, 4.",

There are several reviews been published in recent years stating discovery of new drugs against different viral infections from natural resources 5, 6, 7. The role of traditional medicine for the development of anti-viral compounds is also been discussed in different reviews. Interestingly, it was found that traditional medicines, like Ayurvedic, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Chakma medicines, are good sources for potential anti-viral drugs [5]. A wide variety of active phytochemicals, including the flavonoids, terpenoids, organosulfur compounds, limonoids, lignans, sulfides, polyphenolics, coumarins, saponins, chlorophyllins, furyl compounds, alkaloids, polyines, thiophenes, proteins and peptides have been found to have therapeutic applications against different genetically and functionally diverse viruses 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The anti-viral mechanism of these agents may be explained on basis of their antioxidant activities, scavenging capacities, inhibiting DNA, RNA synthesis, inhibition of the viral entry, or inhibiting the viral reproduction and so on 4, 7, 8. Large numbers of candidate substances, such as phytochemicals and their synthetic derivatives have been identified by a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies in different biological assays 7, 8.",

            "text": "Despite continuous advances made in anti-viral therapy, viral diseases become the leading cause of death globally. Being obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are dependent on the metabolic pathways of the host cell for their replication. Since viruses and hosts are intimately connected, the designing of effective anti-virals that will attack the viral enzymes or its replication, without affecting the host cell has proved to be difficult 1, 2. With the advances in molecular biology and reverse genetics in the past two decades, we have come to know more about the biochemistry of virus replication leading to a more rational approach to the search of anti-viral agents targeting the virus binding or fusion, replication intermediates, DNA/RNA polymerases or viral assembly proteins. Since viral enzymes are crucial for disease progression and virus replication, inhibitors against viral enzymes have been the most desirable strategy. Most of the well-studied inhibitors against HIV, HSV or the Influenza viruses target the host cell binding (T-20, betulinic acid, etc.), uncoating of capsid (amantadine derivatives, pleconaril), replication (reverse transcriptase inhibitors like zidovudine or Abacavir, nevirapine, etc.), integrase inhibitors, DNA or RNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, cidofovir, ribavirin, etc.), proteinases involved in viral polyprotein precursors and assembly/maturation inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir and rimantadine, etc.). On the basis of this strategy numerous compounds have been tested on different viruses in the past decade, but still only 37 licensed anti-virals are in the market.",

            "text": "All ancient cultures in world like China, India, Persia and so on have relied historically and continue to rely on medicinal plants for primary health care. In recent years, owing to the fear of side effects of common drugs over the counter medicines, there has been huge upsurge in people preferring to use more and more natural plant product for preventing and treating serious ailments. However since no scientific background is provided, most of the over the counter herbal products do not have quality control or provide consistent results. Natural plant products have traditionally provided 30\u201340% of modern anti-microbial or anti-cancer drugs to pharmaceutical industry, but we still have barely analysed the tip of iceberg in our efforts to design more anti-microbial drugs from plants. Thus, it is imperative to search for more useful phytochemicals before we lose our herbal resources with the upward march of industrialisation (Table 1\n).Fortunately, many viruses have unique features in their structure or replication cycles that can be the potential targets as evident with nucleoside analogue acycloguanosine (acyclovir) that specifically blocks certain viral enzymes of herpes viruses 1, 9 that play the key role in triggering disease. Owing to the amazing structural diversity and broad range of bioactivities natural products can be explored as a source of complementary anti-virals, as many of them are reported to inhibit several steps of replication cycle and certain cellular factors of many DNA and/or RNA viruses. Many traditional medicinal plants used in Indian (Ayurveda) or TCM have been reported to have strong anti-viral activity and are used to reduce the disease severity 4, 6, 10, 11, 12. Research interests for anti-viral agents started after Second World War in Europe, and in 1952 12 out of 288 plants were found to be effective against influenza viruses in embryonated eggs [13]. During the past 20 years, there have been numerous broad based screening programmes initiated in different parts of the world for screening of anti-viral activity by in vitro and in vivo assays. One hundred British Colombian medicinal plants were screened for anti-viral activity against seven viruses [14], and anti-viral activities against corona viruses, RSV, para influenza, HSV and so on were observed in few. The marine algae such as blue green algae Spirulina has been studied for its immunomodulatory, anti-mutagenic and anti-viral properties 15, 16. Cynovirin N, an 11 kDa protein from blue green algae has been shown to interact with gp120 and inactivate HIV [17]. The presence of various sulfated polysaccharide groups extracted from seaweeds and alga have shown anti-HIV and anti-HSV activity [18].",

Broadly the method of testing is that the test compounds are initially evaluated in a 2-concentration test (with the 10-fold difference for example 1 and 10 ng/ml or \u03bcg/ml). The standard is to use an 18 h monolayer (80\u2013100% confluent) of the appropriate cells, medium is drained and each of the concentrations of test compound or placebo is added, immediately after virus infection. In case effect of drug needs to be tested as pretreatment, cells can be treated with test compound 15 min to 6 h before virus infection. The plate is sealed and incubated for standard time period required to induce near maximal viral CPE. After every 24 h until the end of experiment, the plate is visualised microscopically for any changes in cell appearance compared with normal control cells. During the course of experiment, only test compound but no virus treatment will give an idea of maximum dose of drug causing minimum cell toxicity. These changes may be enlargement, granulity, rounding, detachment from plate and so on. These changes are given a designation of T (100% toxic), PVH (partially toxic \u2013 very heavy \u2013 80%), PH (partially toxic \u2013 heavy \u2013 60%), P (partially toxic\u201440%), PS (partially toxic \u2013 slight \u2013 20%), or 0 (no toxicity\u20140%), conforming to the degree of cytotoxicity seen. A 50% cell inhibitory (cytotoxic) concentration (IC50) and 50% endpoint of virus inhibitory concentration (EC50) can be determined.

While virus is adsorbing, drug dilutions are prepared in the overlay medium.4.The infected cells are overlaid with agarose medium without test drug used as control.Overlay Medium Type I: (MEM or DMEM containing 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin, 1% low melting agarose, without serum and various concentration of test drug).5.Overlay Medium Type II: 100 ml 10X MEM, supplemented with 10 ml glutamine, 10 ml antibiotics, approximately 40 ml bicarbonate and 20 ml foetal bovine serum. 45 ml of CMC is added to 9 ml of the concentrated medium.6.Plates are incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 for three to five days before fixing with 10% formalin or 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min.7.Cells are either stained with 1 ml per well of methylene blue or 1% crystal violet solution (w/v).8.Stain is removed and rinsed gently three times with tap water and allowed to dry inverted overnight and plaques (dark areas) are counted using low power magnification on a binocular microscope.9.Calculation of anti-viral effects: The percentage of inhibition of plaque formation was calculated as follows: [(mean number of plaques in control) \u2212 (mean number of plaques in sample)] \u00d7 100/mean number of plaque in control. The value of IC50 or EC50, which is the concentration of test sample required to inhibit up to 50% of virus growth as compared with the virus control group, are estimated from the graphical plot of the data.\n  \nExample of plaque reduction assay utilised for screening of anti-HSV compounds\n",

It can thus be used to investigate the inhibitory effect of any drug onto the hemagglutinating activity. Untreated erythrocytes precipitate to the bottom of the plate, while upon preincubation with virus the blood cells show an even and diffuse distribution. Briefly, the drug is 10-fold serially diluted (1\u20131000X) as described previously.

Negative controls are carried out with water instead of RNA. PCR runs are carried out as per manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of target DNA and detection of PCR products are performed with a GeneAmp1 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Amplification of the target sequence is detected by an increase of fluorescence above a baseline with no or little change in fluorescence. In order to analyse data, the reporter (FAM) fluorescence is automatically normalised to a passive reference to avoid the measurement of non-PCR-related fluorescence [30]. A threshold is set above the baseline and a threshold cycle value (Ct) is defined as the cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold and a statistically significant increase in fluorescence is first detected. The qPCR amplifications standard curve for test samples is designed from Ct values plotted versus the log of standard concentrations 31, 32, 33.",

An ideal animal model would be able to recreate all aspects of the human disease, but, obviously, this is not attainable. Still, in terms of the ability of HSV to establish a localised initial infection followed by neuronal spread and establishment of latency, a number of very useful models exist for understanding of the disease in humans. The most appropriate model for latency must allow virus reactivation similar to humans. Both rabbit and the guinea pig, approximate this ideal situation, although both suffer from limitations, and expense. A third model, the mouse (the most reasonable in cost), is being used extensively, but suffers from the lack of efficient in vivo reactivation. These three animal systems are extensively used for generating the vast majority of data now available on HSV latency and reactivation, but other models also exist.",

Following topical anaesthesia with 0.5% proparacaine HC1 eye drops, each unscarified rabbit eye was inoculated with a suspension of thymidine-kinase-positive HSV-1W strain (5 \u00d7 104\n pfu/eye) into the lower fornix, following a topical anaesthesia with eye drops. The HSV-1W establishes latency and reactivates in a manner similar to mouse pathogenic strain HSV-1 McKrae [41]. Successful inoculation (100%) of eyes was found on day 7 with typical herpetic dendritic ulcers and significant HSV-1 titre (104\n pfu/ml) and viral shedding can be determined by neutralisation test. After satisfactory anaesthesia the globe is proptosed with a wooden cotton applicator and an operating microscope is used to facilitate all surgical manipulations. The intrastromal injection (by a no. 30 short bevel needle attached to a 0.25-ml tuberculin syringe) is injected into the central corneal stroma. One group will receive deionised sterile endotoxin-free water; another group will get 100 \u03bcl air while the third group will receive no injection, and for all three groups, the needle should be carefully withdrawn, and the proptosed globe gently returned to the orbit by gentle digital pressure. The anterior chamber injection with deionised sterile water is made at the limbus, inserted into the anterior chamber parallel to the iris plane. Needle is carefully withdrawn, and the insertion site will be pressed with a cotton swab for 30 s, to avoid aqueous loss. This pressure also returned the proptosed globe to its proper place in the orbit. For topical administration of 100 ml deionised sterile water will be made onto the cornea of the proptosed globe by a pipette and the globe will return to the orbit by gentle digital pressure. Viral Shedding (detection of latent HSV-1 after reactivation and induced shedding into the tear film) is determined by swabbing the eyes two days before treatment and for 7 consecutive days after treatment. Each eye swab is mixed with 0.3 ml MEM (modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salt, 10% newborn calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% Fungizone), vortexed, and the eluant is plated onto a Vero cell monolayer. After a 1-h adsorption period, an additional 1.5 ml media is added to the well, and the plate can be examined daily for seven days for the progressive CPE characteristic of HSV-1. Random HSV-1 isolates can be confirmed by neutralisation 40, 42.",

This model system is roughly analogous to genital infection of HSV in humans, and has been central to describing many of the parameters of HSV latent infection including the identification of the neuron as the site of latent infection, axonal transport of virus through the sciatic nerve, ability of non-replicating virus to establish latent infections, and the characterisation of restricted transcription of the latency specific transcription unit during the latent phase of infection. Further, the model is useful with HSV-2, despite this virus\u2019 greater neuropathology. Following infection of the footpad, local pathology is observed with clear evidence of involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), the mice that recover are evidently physiologically normal. When dorsal root ganglia are dissected and cultured on feeder cells, HSV-induced cytopathology can be detected within 4\u201312 days. This explant recovery of HSV from such latently infected spinal ganglia has been an extremely useful and relatively inexpensive means of assaying the presence of viral genomes within the tissue.",

For RSV multiple animal models is needed as in humans RSV is a multifaceted disease whose clinical manifestations and sequelae depend upon age, genetic makeup, immunologic status. There is no single human subpopulation in which all forms of RSV disease manifest, nor is there a single animal model that duplicates all forms of RSV disease. Hence, the choice of animal model will be governed by the specific manifestation of disease to be studied and thus no single animal model can duplicate all aspects of primary RSV disease in man. The cost, availability, and opposition from animal rights activists will restrict the study of RSV in primate models, particularly the chimpanzee. The primary advantage of the models are: the calf is the natural host of an RSV species; the cotton rat have high permissiveness and reliability as a predictor of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies; the mouse had wide availability of specialised strains and reagents; the guinea pig is best for parallels in reactive airway disease; and the ferret produce age-dependent pulmonary infection.

For example, both viruses cause acute disease in the respiratory tract, induce an incomplete immune response permitting repeated life long infections, cause epidemic during winter, are attenuated by high levels of maternally derived antibody, and cause severe pulmonary disease in neonates [59]. The calf model however, has many drawbacks like cost of purchasing and maintaining animals, lack of inbred strains, and lack of specific reagents. Additionally two characteristics of clinical disease caused by bovine RSV in calves raise concerns about its usefulness. First, bovine RSV commonly causes fever, but human RSV does not [60] and it is unknown whether this is due to differences in the viruses or in host responses. Second, bacterial (pasteurella, haemophilus [61] and mycoplasmal [62] coinfections are common complications of bovine RSV infection, whereas such coinfections with human RSV are rare.",

The mouse model has several advantages over other species, like availability of inbred, congenic, transgenic, and knockout strains; specific reagents allowing identification and quantitation of cell types, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and relatively low purchase and maintenance costs.

The hardware includes a transmitter (E-Mitter)/receiver system. The E-Mitter collects data on temperature and gross motor activity for the lifetime of the animal. The temperature sensitive devices alter their pulse rate in response to temperature changes. The Vital View system records the average rate and converts this to temperature using temperature calibration values specific to each unit. The vitality or gross motor activity measurement provides a basic index of the movement of mice with implanted E-Mitter. As the mouse moves, movement of the implanted E-Mitter results in subtle changes in the transmitted signal. These small changes are detected by a receiver via telemetry and registered by a connected computer as activity counts. In our experiments the Vital View software recorded an index of movement every 5 min to produce a longitudinal record of the activity. For implantation of the E-Mitters the mice are anaesthetised with intraperitoneal injection of 150 \u03bcl ketamine/rompun. The ventral surface of the abdomen was shaved and a midline abdominal skin incision is made 0.5\u20131 cm below the diaphragm with no more then 2 cm in length. The abdomen is opened with a 2 cm incision along the linea alba and the E-Mitter is positioned in the abdominal cavity. After the incision was closed with two to three wound clips (autoclip 9 mm; Becton & Dickinson, Germany). The animals are placed into the cage and successful implantation of the E-Mitter is controlled by Vital View software. Health status is controlled for seven days before infection.",

As it is transmissible to humans by inoculation or inhalation of infectious virus, all suspected infected material must be handled under the appropriate safety conditions specified by the World Health Organisation [69]. Seven distinct genetic lineages can be distinguished within the genus Lyssavirus by cross-protection tests and molecular biological analysis 70, 71, 72, namely the classical rabies virus itself (RABV, genotype 1, serotype 1), Lagos bat virus (LBV, genotype 2, serotype 2), Mokola virus (MOKV, genotype 3, serotype 3), and Duvenhage virus (DUUV, genotype 4, serotype 4). The European bat lyssaviruses (EBLV), subdivided into two biotypes (EBLV1, genotype 5 and EBLV2, genotype 6) and the Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV, genotype 7), recently isolated in Australia (24), are also members of the Lyssavirus genus, but are not yet classified into serotypes. Viruses of serotypes 2-4, EBLV and ABLV are known as rabies-related viruses. An experimental model of rabies was established in the fruit-eating bat Artibeus jamaicensis, infecting with CVS-N2c and CVS-B2c, which are both stable variants of CVS-24 in the right masseter muscle. CVS-N2c produced neurologic signs of rabies with paresis, ataxia, and inability to fly, while CVS-B2c did not produce neurologic signs. Bats were sacrificed and the distribution of rabies virus antigen was assessed in tissue sections with immunoperoxidase staining. Both viruses spread to the brain stem and bilaterally to the trigeminal ganglia by days 2 to 3. CVS-N2c had disseminated widely in the central nervous system (CNS) by day 4 and had involved the spinal cord, thalamus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. CVS-B2c had infected neurons in the spinal cord on day 5 and in the cerebellum, thalamus, and cerebral cortex on day 6. Infected pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus were observed on day 5 in CVS-N2c infection, but infected neurons were never noted in the hippocampus in CVS-B2c infection. CVS-N2c infected many more neurons and more prominently involved neuronal processes than CVS-B2c. CVS-N2c spread more efficiently in the CNS than CVS-B2c. Morphologic changes of apoptosis or biochemical evidence of DNA fragmentation were not observed in neurons with either virus after this route of inoculation. The different neurovirulent properties of these CVS variants in this model were not related to their in vivo ability to induce apoptosis [73].",

The inoculum is the clarified supernatant of a 20% (w/v) homogenate of brain material (cortex, Ammon's horn, cerebellum, medulla oblongata) in an isotonic buffered solution containing antibiotics. To reduce animal pain, mice should be anaesthetised when inoculated. The young adult mice are observed daily for 28 days, and every dead mouse is examined for rabies using the FAT. For street fox rabies strains, deaths due to rabies generally begin nine days postinoculation. For faster results in newborn mice, it is possible to check one baby mouse by FAT on days 5, 7, 9 and 11 postinoculation. This in vivo test is quite expensive, particularly if SPF mice are used, and should be avoided where possible. It does not give rapid results (compared with in vitro inoculation tests), but when the test is positive, a large amount of virus can be isolated from a single mouse brain for strain identification purposes.

Once a cell culture unit exists in the laboratory, this test should replace the mouse inoculation test as it avoids the use of live animals, is less expensive and gives more rapid results.

Fusion was monitored with a three-laser BD FACSAria Cell Sorting System. While for ex vivo efficacy testing of drug Efavirenz, macrophages were pretreated overnight and T cells for 1 h with efavirenz at the indicated concentrations, and then they were subsequently challenged with single-round VSV-G HIV-1NL4\u20133 EGFP reporter virions (200\u2013500 ng of p24 per 3 \u00d7 106 T cells or per \u22482 \u00d7 105 macrophages). On day 3 postinfection, the percentage of EGFP-positive T cells and macrophages was scored by flow cytometry on a FACS-Calibur by using BD CellQuest Pro 4.0.2 software. For in vivo efficacy testing two independent studies with a similar design were performed (animal age 8 weeks; weight 140\u2013306 g). For the NNRTI study, groups consisting of six hCD4/hCCR5-transgenic rats were treated with either efavirenz at 25 mg/kg per day or PBS by once-daily oral gavage for three days. On day 3, rats from both experimental groups were anaesthetised and challenged by tail vein injection through a plastic catheter with HIV-1YU-2 (6.7 \u00d7 106 TZM-BL IU; 5000 ng of p24 per rat; [78]). For the fusion inhibitor study, groups consisting of five or six hCD4/hCCR5-transgenic rats were treated with enfuvirtide at 4 mg/kg per day, applied by either twice-daily or once-daily s.c. injection. The control group was injected twice daily with an equivalent volume of distilled water. On day 3, all rats were challenged i.v. with HIV-1YU-2 (6.7 \u00d7 105 TZM-BL IU; 500 ng of p24 per rat). In both efficacy studies, one HIV-nonsusceptible, hCD4-single transgenic rat was challenged with the identical virus inoculum. Dosing was continued for 4 more days postchallenge, and then all animals were killed. Total DNA was prepared from single-cell suspensions of splenocytes by using DNeasy tissue kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and it was analysed by quantitative duplex PCR.",

Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the hepadnaviruses (hepatotropic DNA viruses), causes acute and chronic infection of the liver [89]. Approximately 80% of HBV carriers have different levels of hepatocyte destruction, which could develop into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver cancer [90]. There are about 400 million people with chronic HBV infection, who are at a life-long high risk of developing cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. Up to 30% of the chronic carriers will die of complications of chronic liver diseases 91, 92, 93. Several anti-viral drugs have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis B, including interferon-\u03b3 and nucleoside analogues. However, unresolved significant issues such as moderate to low efficacy, dose-dependent side effects, and drug resistance remain with current drugs [94]. Therefore, there exists a significant unmet medical need for safe and efficacious new anti-HBV drugs. On the contrary, natural products provide a large reservoir of potentially active agents for safer and more efficacious anti-HBV agents.",

Consistent with the HBV antigen reduction, the extract (100 \u03bcg/ml) reduced HBV DNA level by 35.9%. In duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infected ducks (intragastricly (i.g.) once a day for 10 days), the plasma DHBV DNA level was reduced (ED50 47.54 mg/kg). In addition, Southern blot analysis confirmed the in vivo anti-HBV effect of the extract in ducks and extract also reduced the plasma and the liver DHBV DNA level in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, significant improvement of the liver was observed after extract treatment, as evaluated by the histopathological analysis. Another study with HBV-transfected liver cell line revealed that wogonin, a potent antiinflammatory and anti-cancer dug, isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Scutellaria radix (used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions including hepatitis) reduces the levels of the HBV antigens and DNA and inhibits HBV DNA polymerase with much higher potencies [91] and more importantly, demonstrated the anti-HBV activity in vivo in Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV)-infected ducks and in human HBV-transgenic mice. In the human HBV-transfected liver cell line HepG2.2.15, wogonin effectively suppressed the secretion of HBV antigens (both HBsAg and HBeAg) with an IC50 of 4 \u03bcg/ml at day 9, and reduced HBV DNA level in a dose-dependent manner. DHBV DNA polymerase was dramatically inhibited by wogonin with an IC50 of 0.57 \u03bcg/ml, and in DHBV-infected ducks wogonin (once a day for 10 days) reduced plasma DHBV DNA level with an ED50 of 5 mg/kg. The in vivo anti-HBV effect of wogonin in ducks was confirmed by Southern blotting of duck viral DNA in the liver. Additionally in human HBV-transgenic mice, wogonin (i.v. once a day for 10 days) significantly reduced plasma HBsAg level [95].",

The currently available anti-virals though effective are beyond means of most developing countries. Thus, the development of safe, effective and inexpensive anti-viral drugs like RT inhibitors is among the top global priorities as many viruses are not yet curable and have high mortality rates. Recently considerable attention has been given to screening of various species of medicinal plants especially with focus on anti-HIV activity 102, 103, 104, 105, 106. There has been considerable rise in using over the counter medicinal plant products containing orthodox medicinal drugs. The rationale is to reduce the side effects and to produce synergistic effects. But since in most cases pharmacological mechanisms of the combinations are not well studied, adverse effects or therapeutic failures have been observed [107]. The most important consideration involving medicinal plants is to identify and standardise the exact method of preparation of an extract, appropriate season of collecting plant material and details of administration 10, 108.",
