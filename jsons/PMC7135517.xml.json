Many jurisdictions have developed a comprehensive plan for allocating scarce health care resources (e.g., critical care beds) in the event of a pandemic.1, 2, 3 If these plans are implemented, some critically ill patients will be denied life-sustaining therapy based on a triage system. However, all plans are clear that any patient who is denied life-sustaining therapy can still expect to receive palliative care.1, 2, 3 Unfortunately, they do not include a plan for coping with a large \u201csurge\u201d in the demand for palliative care.",

Using a model developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States, the Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic estimates that more than 60,000 patients will require hospitalization, \u223c9,000 will require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, \u223c4,500 will require mechanical ventilation, and \u223c12,000 will die over an eight-week period.1 At present, Ontario has \u223c1,000 ventilator-supported ICU beds, of which more than 90% are occupied at any given time. By the fourth week of the outbreak, our need for mechanical ventilation will be 200% of our capacity (assuming that the needs of noninfluenza patients do not change). By Week 5, more than 1,800 people will require hospital admission, and almost 200 will die in hospital every day from influenza alone. At times, the number of seriously ill patients denied life-sustaining therapy may actually exceed the number who receive it. According to the plan, all of the former are supposed to receive palliative care. Unfortunately, our palliative care resources are even more limited than our critical care resources, and they would likely be overwhelmed within days.",

One report identified a number of substantive values that have relevance here.13 These include:\u2022\nProtection of the public from harm. An influenza pandemic and a triage system have the potential to create significant physical and emotional distress. We have an obligation to protect those who suffer from the effects of the pandemic and the triage system.\u2022\nProportionality. Any triage of palliative care resources must reflect the needs of the community and should not exceed what is necessary to provide high-quality palliative care to those in need. Medications, equipment, beds, and specialists should not be \u201choarded\u201d when others in the community need them.\u2022\nDuty to provide care. Palliative care is a critical component of any pandemic triage plan, and palliative care practitioners have an obligation to provide care and relieve suffering during a pandemic. We must always balance this duty against competing obligations to protect our own health and that of our families, but there are options for health care workers who have trouble finding this balance (e.g., vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis). The risks of contracting a dangerous communicable disease are well known to those who provide patient care, and they were certainly known to us when we freely chose to enter our profession.\u2022\nReciprocity. We should focus greater palliative resources on patients who assume a greater burden from the triage system, such as critically ill patients who are denied life-sustaining therapy. These patients (and their families) are at great risk of feeling abandoned by the health care system, and they must not be denied care.\u2022\nEquity. We must ensure that high-quality palliative care is available to all patients who might need it, regardless of their location. Patients who cannot receive adequate palliative care in their present location should have a high priority for transfer to an appropriate facility. We also must ensure that palliative care is prioritized alongside \u201cnonpalliative\u201d care for access to medications, staff, and other resources. Palliative care patients have an equal demand to care even if they are not expected to survive.\u2022\nTrust. Health care providers must communicate honestly and make decisions transparently to maintain the trust of other health care workers and the public. Health care practitioners must be clear when treating symptoms that they are not seeking to hasten death or practice euthanasia. Trust can easily be lost, and it is very difficult to restore.\n",
