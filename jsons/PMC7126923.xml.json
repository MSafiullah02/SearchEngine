Since then, the recommendations have remained virtually unchanged.2 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has also, this year, recommended treatment for all hospitalized children.3 Rapid detection influenza tests have moderate sensitivity (50\u201370%). Therefore, antiviral treatment has been recommended even in cases with negative laboratory results. Oseltamivir has demonstrated to reduce the duration of symptoms, especially if it is administrated in the first 48 h of the illness with mild or inexistent side effects. Its role to prevent complications is not enough proven. Summarizing, emergence of antiviral resistance is an important clinical and public health concern.4\n",

In the 2009\u201310 season, patients were recruited from September to December, coinciding with the H1N1 pandemic. A total of 1612 cases were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction for 17 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate was performed in the Respiratory Virus and Influenza Unit at the National Microbiology Center (ISCIII, Madrid, Spain).",

Careful monitoring of levels of viral resistance in the circulating viruses combined with the further development of new anti-influenza drugs might be the best way for control.5 Based on our personal experience, we recommend making an effort to improve diagnosis in children with suspected influenza, performing molecular techniques or a rapid diagnostic test with high sensitivity,6 especially in children with risk factors and children requiring hospitalization. This may help to guide treatment with oseltamivir to patients who really need it.",
