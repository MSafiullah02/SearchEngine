Eleven states, including California, New York, and Louisiana, require a license to practice the medical laboratory science profession (3) .

On March 12, for example, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order suspending certification and licensure requirements for any researcher with relevant skills who meets CLIA requirements to run the COVID-19 test; such a person may now temporarily run the assays under the supervision of a medical laboratory scientist in a CLIA-certified lab (4). On March 19, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards issued a proclamation to temporarily suspend some certification and licensure requirements for running COVID-19 assays. Now, laboratory personnel \"who demonstrate molecular biology polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experience\" can legally run COVID-19 tests if they are supervised by a licensed physician or PhD with related lab experience, according to the proclamation (5). Hence, an ecologist trained in PCR might now be a candidate to run COVID-19 assays, if properly supervised, says Vincent Culotta, executive director of the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners in New Orleans.",

Because the pathogen, labeled novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a single-stranded RNA virus, testers first isolate viral RNA from a nasal swab sample using an RNA extraction kit (6) . Then they apply a solution of selected nucleotides and the enzyme reverse transcriptase to create complimentary DNA to the RNA. Finally, the DNA is amplified into many copies using a polymerase chain reaction in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) machine. A fluorescent dye in the PCR reaction specifically binds and illuminates SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences. So if the qPCR detects a strong fluorescent signal, the sample is positive for the coronavirus.",

UC Berkeley's only CLIA-certified lab, for example, is in their student health center, Schaletzky notes. It didn't have the appropriate setup to handle testing for the virus. But there are potential workarounds. To get around its limitations, UC Berkeley is temporarily extending the clinical lab's CLIA certificate into the larger Innovative Genomics Institute on campus, and will staff it with volunteer researchers who have the relevant skills to run the assay, supervised by a licensed medical laboratory scientist. Governor Newsom's executive order, as well as revised emergency guidelines from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), made the temporary extension possible, as Berkeley's CLIA-certified lab in the health center can extend its certification to another location on campus. The several medical laboratory scientists already working there will oversee at least 15 Berkeley postdoctoral molecular biologist volunteers, who will run the COVID-19 assays.",

First, in February, the CDC's faulty test kits delayed efforts by three weeks (7) . Some testing centers made their own COVID-19 assays, choosing their preferred brand of RNA extraction kits, primers, PCR machines, and swabs, Schaletzky explains. Bespoke testing protocols must be granted emergency authorization by the FDA and crossvalidated by an independent CLIA-certified lab. The problem is that once a testing protocol is approved, none of the reagents or equipment can be changed, not even by brand if the original supplier runs out. \"If you run out of swabs, there's no way to suddenly accept a different kind of swab in your protocol according to the guidelines,\" Schaletzky explains. \"That's what leads to the shortages we have, because it's not flexible.\"",
