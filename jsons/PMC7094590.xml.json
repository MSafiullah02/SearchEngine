These viruses are divided into three distinct groups on the basis of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) causes a mild form of the common cold and belongs to group 1, which includes the recently discovered human coronavirus NL636 and the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Human coronaviruses belonging to group 2 are OC43 and HKU1, the latter also having been discovered very recently.7 The SARS coronavirus has been classified as an outlier of group 2.8 Coronaviruses infecting birds have been identified as a separate group (group 3).9\n",

In preliminary experiments, we have shown that Nsp10 from mouse hepatitis (corona)virus (MHV) is a double-stranded RNA-binding zinc-finger protein,18 and that HCoV-229E Nsp8 and Nsp9 interact with nucleic acids.19 Also, it has been proposed recently that Nsp9 might interact specifically with the stem\u2013loop II motif (s2m), a well defined RNA secondary-structure element at the 3\u2032 end of many coronavirus genomes.20 However, s2m does not seem to be conserved in HCoV 229E\u2020. Nsp8 of SARS-CoV has the function of an RNA primase;21 its 8:8 complex with Nsp7 has a three-dimensional structure reminiscent of the \u03b22 \u201dsliding clamp\u201d of bacterial DNA polymerase, with a central channel suitable for double-stranded RNA binding.22 It has been shown by analytical ultracentrifugation that Nsp8 also interacts with Nsp9,23 although according to our own measurements using surface plasmon resonance, this interaction is either absent or very weak (R.P., unpublished results). Colocalization of Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, and Nsp10 was observed in MHV.24 Very likely, these non-structural proteins are involved directly in the replication complex built around the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12).",

In spite of 45% sequence identity between SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E Nsp9, the wild-type structure of the latter exhibits a mode of homodimerization that is entirely different from what has been observed in the crystal structure of the former.23, 25 To probe the effect of the observed intermolecular disulfide bridge on the formation of the HCoV-229E Nsp9 dimer, Cys69 was mutated to alanine. The crystal structure of this Nsp9 mutant shows a dimerization mode similar to that observed in SARS-CoV Nsp9.23, 25 However, gel mobility-shift assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements indicate that only the wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9, not the Cys69Ala mutant, binds strongly to single-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA. In order to assess a possible direct role of Cys69 in nucleic acid binding, this residue was also replaced by serine. Again, the mutant showed little or no affinity to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Finally, the corresponding residue (Cys73) of SARS-CoV Nsp9, which did not form a disulfide bond, was replaced by alanine and serine. Both mutants showed wild-type affinity to single-stranded oligonucleotides. It is therefore concluded that Nsp9 of HCoV 229E is substantially different from its orthologue in SARS-CoV.",

The segment comprising residues 53\u201356 could be built into electron density but proved to be very flexible. The structure was refined to a resolution of 1.80 \u00c5, with R\n = 22.1% and R\nfree\n = 28.1% (see Supplementary Data Fig. S1). Of the amino acid residues in the structural model, 92.5% are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and the remainder are in the additionally allowed regions.26\n",

The \u03b1-helix of each monomer is also involved in dimerization through formation of two hydrogen bonds between the Asn92 side-chain and the main-chain of residue 74 (\u03b2-strand 6), as well as one H-bond between the Asn92 side-chain amide and the C-terminal carboxylate (residue 109; Fig. 2b). Among the sequenced coronaviral Nsp9 proteins, this asparagine is present only in HCoV 229E and SARS-CoV; other coronaviruses have either Thr or Ser at this position. There is a fourth hydrogen bond donated by the N\u03b71 atom of totally conserved Arg95 (helix H1; see Supplementary Data Fig. S3 for sequence alignment) to the main-chain carbonyl of residue 72 (\u03b2-strand 6). Because of the crystallographic twofold symmetry, all of these interactions are duplicated in the dimer, so that there are eight intersubunit hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2b). In spite of the presence of these favorable interactions, there seem to be a number of less ideal interactions. For example, Arg70 does not have an interaction partner proper; its side-chain makes contacts with Pro67 and Pro68. Its intersubunit contacts are in fact determined by the nearby disulfide bond (Cys A69\u2013Cys B69). There is a weak, but favorable interaction between the side-chains of Phe A71 and Phe B86. The two \u03b1-helices (residues 92\u2013108) that are part of the interface are in an antiparallel orientation (describing an angle of 167\u00b0, Fig. 2a) with a close approach of 3.77 \u00c5 between the C\u03b1 atoms of Gly A96 and Gly B103. In between these two glycines of the \u03b1-helix, there is a third one, Gly100, which also facilitates the close approach of the two helices (the distance to its symmetry mate is 4.13 \u00c5; see Supplementary Data Fig. S4). Gly96 and Gly100 are completely conserved among the coronaviruses, and Gly103 is present in group 1 coronaviruses (Supplementary Data Fig. S3).

A disulfide bond is not formed, and the dimerization interface involves mainly the \u03b1-helix of each subunit, but in a parallel rather than anti-parallel orientation.23, 25 In contrast to HCoV-229E Nsp9, which we had prepared with authentic N and C termini, the SARS-CoV protein used by Sutton et al.23 for crystallization carried 30 additional amino acid residues at the N terminus, due to the cloning procedure. From the structure,23 it is evident that the additional N-terminal segment leads to formation of a \u03b2-hairpin involving residues \u22127 to 8, as well as an intermolecular salt bridge between GluA(\u22127) and ArgB111. This additional interaction might favor the dimerization mode seen in the Sutton et al. structure. However, the structure published by Egloff et al.25 for SARS-CoV Nsp9 was derived from a protein that carried only six additional histidine residues at its N terminus (B. Canard, personal communication). These residues were not seen in the electron density maps, presumably due to disorder, and certainly are not involved in intersubunit interactions. Yet, this structure still features a mode of dimerization that is highly similar to that described by Sutton et al.23 and completely different from that observed by us for HCoV-229E Nsp9.",

            "text": "Disulfide bonds are rare in proteins in the cytosol, where the environment is of reducing character, and we therefore have to discuss the possibility that the dimerization mode seen in our structure of HCoV-229E Nsp9 is an artifact of disulfide bond formation, in spite of the presence of 5 mM DTT throughout protein preparation and crystallization (higher concentrations of DTT prevented crystallization of the protein). In order to assess the role of the disulfide bond in dimer formation, we replaced Cys69 in HCoV-229E Nsp9 by alanine. The structure of the mutated protein (Fig. 2c) revealed a dimer that is grossly different from that of wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9: When superimposing monomer A of the mutant structure onto the same monomer of the wild-type protein, the centroid of monomer B deviates from its position in the wild-type protein by 23.5 \u00c5, and the angle of rotation between the two positions of monomer B is 72\u00b0. However, this dimerization mode is identical with that of SARS-CoV Nsp9 (cf. Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data Fig. S5). The dimer of the HCoV-229E Cys69Ala mutant can be superimposed onto the dimer of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 protein (1QZ8\n25) with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.99 \u00c5 for 175 C\u03b1 atom pairs (see Supplementary Data Fig. S5). The r.m.s. deviation is much higher (2.7 \u00c5 for 191 C\u03b1 atom pairs) for the SARS-CoV Nsp9 structure described by Sutton et al.23 (1UW7); this is very likely due to the disturbances of the latter structure by the N-terminal tag residues. In the HCoV-229E Nsp9 mutant, dimerization appears to rely on a few interactions only. There is no single proper hydrogen bond between the two monomers, and only a few hydrophobic contacts mediate the interaction (Fig. 2d). The immediate N terminus is disordered, but residues 3\u20136 and 5\u20137 of the A and B chain, respectively, lie over the other monomer and interact weakly with conserved Phe71 (strand \u03b26) and with the C-terminal \u03b1-helix near residues Leu99 and Gly103. The majority of the interactions between the two monomers is made by the two helices, one from each monomer, that run largely in parallel in this dimer, crossing at an angle of 48\u00b0 and a closest approach of 3.96 \u00c5 (C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1) between Ala97 and Gly100 (Fig. 2d). But again, the hydrophobic contacts between the helices are only weak. Importantly, neither of the two helices deviates from its ideal geometry, including the intrahelical hydrogen bonds, for the benefit of the intermolecular contacts. The surface area buried upon dimer formation32 is 687 \u00c52 for the mutant protein. This value is significantly lower than that observed for the dimerization mode seen for the wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 (see above). Even if a few more intermolecular interactions were made by the disordered N-terminal residues not seen in the electron density map (residues 1 and 2 of chain A and 1\u20134 of chain B), this value would not increase dramatically, and such interactions would very likely not be strong (otherwise these residues would not be disordered). In summary, the monomer\u2013monomer interface of the Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV-229E Nsp9 is far from ideal and appears to be much weaker than the interface seen in the wild-type protein.",

There are multiple interactions between monomers across the hexamer, which we discuss briefly here, according to the color scheme used in the figure. At the center of the hexamer, there are two disordered sulfate ions sitting on the crystallographic threefold axis, 19.0 \u00c5 apart. They make ionic interactions (2.58 \u00c5 from the closest sulfate oxygen) with the Lys50 sidechains (N\u03b6 atom) of the red, green and blue monomers (upper layer of the hexamer) and the yellow, cyan, and magenta monomers (lower layer), respectively. Also, Asp19 of each monomer forms a 2.90 \u00c5 intermolecular hydrogen bond with the Lys50 residue (e.g., red\u2013green), as well as a 4.76 \u00c5 intramolecular salt bridge with Lys50 of the same monomer (e.g., red\u2013red). As a result, we find a ring of ionic interactions formed by Asp19 (loop L12) and Lys50 (L34) residues along both the upper and the lower rim of the central cylinder inside the trimer of dimers (Fig. 3). Asp19 is present in most coronavirus Nsp9 sequences (not in SARS-CoV and IBV), whereas Lys50 is highly conserved across the family (see Supplementary Data Fig. 3). The cylindrical hole running along the threefold axis is only about 4.4 \u00c5 wide, i.e. large enough for sulfate ions, but too small to accommodate single-stranded nucleic acid at the center of the hexamer (Fig. 3).",

However, in a more recent preparation of the wild-type protein, reaction with Ellman's reagent immediately after purification of wild-type Nsp9 did indicate the presence of one free cysteine per mole of protein. Crystallization of this sample yielded crystals overnight that were of the same habit as the original crystals obtained for the wild-type protein, with unit cell parameters a\n = \nb\n = 85.4 \u00c5 and c\n = 48.8 \u00c5 in space group P622. When we investigated this phenomenon further, we observed that the formation of the disulfide bond seemed to depend on the age of the protein preparation. It is possible that in the presence of oxygen, gradual oxidation of the protein (probably correlated with the oxidation of DTT) may lead to formation of the disulfide bond, resulting in the dimerization mode visualized by X-ray crystallography. The concentration of DTT required to reduce the disulfide bond completely was determined as 10 mM by SDS gel electrophoresis (see Materials and Methods). With concentrations of DTT up to 4 mM, the dimer was the dominant species visible on the gel, whereas above, the monomer was more pronounced. The dimer band vanished completely at 10 mM DTT. This result was the same independent of the presence or the absence of a heating step (95 \u00b0C for 5 min).",

Nsp9 of SARS-CoV also bound to both single-stranded and, again very weakly, to double-stranded oligonucleotides (Fig. 5b). However, the effect on the gel mobility shift did not increase smoothly with oligonucleotide length; rather, there was a stepwise increase from the 13-mer (Fig. 5b, lane 3; no shift) via the 18-mer and 24-mer (lanes 4 and 5) and the 30-\u201345-mers (lanes 6\u20139) to the 50-mer (lane 10). In contrast, nucleic acid binding by the HCoV-229E Cys69Ala mutant was not detectable with this method, except for a very weak shift with the 55-mer (Fig. 5c, lane HAM 3). As the apparent inability of the Cys69Ala mutant to bind nucleic acids could depend on the lack of a direct (hydrogen bonding) interaction between the cysteine and the oligonucleotides, we also replaced the cysteine by serine. The Cys69Ser mutant did not bind short oligonucleotides either, but did show some gel shift with the 55-mer (Fig. 5c, lane HSM 3). Next, we replaced the corresponding cysteine in SARS-CoV Nsp9 by alanine and serine. Both the Cys73Ala and Cys73Ser mutants displayed a similar shift in the presence of the 55-mer oligodeoxynucleotide as the wild-type protein (Fig. 5c, lanes SAM 3 and SSM 3). Reduction (by 50 mM DTT) or oxidation (by 17.5% H2O2) of the disulfide-containing wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 did not change the gel mobility-shift pattern of the protein in the presence of nucleic acids (not shown).",

This is not true for HCoV-229E Nsp9, the binding profile of which agrees well with a single-state binding model. However, we could not use concentrations of HCoV-229E Nsp9 greater than 35 \u03bcM (SARS-CoV Nsp9: 85 \u03bcM), because non-specific binding appeared to govern the profile above this value and saturation was not reached.

The wild-type protein exhibits a homodimer that is very different from that seen previously for SARS-CoV Nsp9,23, 25 in spite of a sequence identity of 45% between the two proteins. In HCoV-229E Nsp9, dimerization is mediated by a disulfide bridge, a few hydrogen bonds, and by hydrophobic interactions between the C-terminal helix of each monomer. One major difference between our preparation of HCoV-229E Nsp9 and that of SARS-CoV Nsp9 by both Egloff et al. 25 and Sutton et al. 23 is that we have worked with a protein with authentic chain termini, whereas the SARS-CoV protein used by those authors has N-terminal extensions from the cloning procedure (a His6 tag in the case of the Egloff et al. structure, and an extra 30 residues in the Sutton et al. structure). Interestingly, the differences of the N-terminal extensions between the two reported structures of SARS-CoV Nsp9 led to deviations in the dimer in detail, resulting in a rather high r.m.s. deviation of 2.07 \u00c5 (for C\u03b1 atoms) between the two models. Residues \u22127 to \u22122 of the N-terminal tag present in the Sutton et al. structure form an extra antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with residues 3\u20138 of the protein, thereby pushing away the \u03b26-\u03b27 hairpin (L67; Supplementary Data Fig. S5) and causing the C-terminal part of the \u03b1-helix to kink. Regardless of whether the presence of the extra residues at the N terminus of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 preparations used for structure determination results in artifacts, the observation of a completely different, disulfide-linked dimer in HCoV-229E Nsp9 is remarkable.",

M3 is formed by the \u03b26-\u03b27 hairpin and involves mainly hydrophobic interactions between side-chains that are not conserved (Supplementary Data Table S1), although we note that a similar interface exists in the Egloff et al. 25 structure of SARS-CoV Nsp9. The other interface, M2, arises through some limited interaction between strands \u03b25 of neighboring molecules in the crystal. M2 has four hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms and is reminiscent of intersubunit interactions involving \u03b2-strands in the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) from Escherichia coli, a prototype OB-fold protein.28 This same alternative dimerization mode was discussed by Sutton et al. 23 for their structure of the SARS-CoV Nsp9, but was considered irrelevant. However, this interface is found also in the SARS-CoV Nsp9 structure described by Egloff et al.\n25 even though the space group of these crystals is different. In summary, both dimerization modes M1 and M2 occur in all crystal structures of Nsp9 described so far (except that of the HCoV-229E wild-type protein), even in a second crystal form mentioned briefly by Sutton et al. 23 (for which no data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank), i.e. in a total of four different crystalline environments. We therefore propose that Nsp9 oligomerization, in particular in the presence of ssRNA, is mediated through these two protein\u2013protein interaction surfaces. The existence of such oligomers in solution is supported by our glutaraldehyde crosslinking experiments, which revealed the presence of monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers for wild-type SARS-CoV Nsp9 and HCoV-229E Cys69Ala Nsp9 in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 4). Interestingly, for the wild-type 229E protein, only monomers, dimers, and, to a limited extent, trimers were seen by this method. This is consistent with the observed crystal structures: when in the disulfide-linked state, wild-type 229E Nsp9 cannot normally form oligomers larger than hexamers (Fig. 3), whereas the Cys69Ala mutant as well as SARS-CoV Nsp9 can form polymers (Fig. 7\n).",

By superimposition with the structure of the wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9, which was crystallized from sulfate, two further sulfate-binding sites are revealed. One is also near Lys50(52), but in a different position, and the other interacts with Lys82(86). The resulting five independent sulfate positions were used to define a path for ssRNA on the surface of the monomer and, subsequently, the polymer. We also note that the residues that we propose to interact with the ssRNA on the basis of this model (Lys10, Lys50, Tyr51, Arg70, Tyr83, Lys88, and Arg107) are better conserved, on average, than the polypeptide sequence. In our crude model, the ssRNA forms a left-handed helix wrapping around the Nsp9 polymer, similar to the model proposed recently for the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV interacting with ssRNA.41 In our model, approximately 40 nucleotides can be bound per Nsp9 dimer within the extended polymer that we propose for SARS-CoV Nsp9 (Fig. 7a).",

In agreement with the structural data discussed above, surface-exposed positively charged residues could interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid. However, there is a strong correlation between the length of the oligonucleotide and the gel mobility-shift observed (Fig. 5a and b). Although the dimerization modes of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV Nsp9 wild-type proteins are very different, their binding profile to nucleic acid in the gel mobility-shift experiment is similar (neglecting the stepwise rather than linear increase of the gel shift with oligonucleotide lengths in case of the SARS-CoV protein). On the other hand, the HCoV-229E Cys69Ala mutant has a dimerization mode similar to that of the wild-type SARS-CoV Nsp9 but it does not show binding with the nucleic acid in the gel mobility-shift experiment (except for the small shift seen for the 55-mer, the longest oligonucleotide tested). This inability to bind oligonucleotides could, in principle, be due to a direct interaction of the Cys69 with the nucleic acid. Therefore, we prepared an additional three mutants; namely, HCoV-229E Cys69Ser and the corresponding mutants of SARS-CoV Nsp9, Cys73Ala and Cys73Ser. Similar to HCoV-229E Cys69Ala, the Cys69Ser mutant did not exhibit a significant shift in the ZIGE experiment. However, the homologous SARS-CoV Cys73Ala and Cys73Ser mutants did show a shift of the same magnitude as the SARS-CoV Nsp9 wild-type (Fig. 5c). It remains to be understood why the HCoV-229E Cys69Ala and Cys69Ser mutants apparently do not bind nucleic acids, whereas the corresponding SARS-CoV mutants do.",

All three cysteines are in the free form, as we could determine using Ellman's reagent (data not shown). If one of these cysteines was involved in an intermolecular disulfide bond, the latter would probably be reduced by the remaining ones, so that a disulfide-bonded dimer would be unlikely to be the dominant species.

There are several earlier reports suggesting the regulation of DNA/RNA-binding proteins by redox processes. Thus, the redox state has been shown to determine the interaction with DNA of the multifunctional eukaryotic SSB protein, RPA.44 Also, many transcription factors including Fos, Jun, NF-\u03baB, PaX, FNR, OxyR are regulated by the redox state of the environment.45 Another example is the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which binds to DNA with sequence specificity only in the reduced state. Disulfide formation in the oxidized state alters the conformation and the protein binds DNA without any sequence specificity.36\n",

Among the coronavirus family, TGEV was shown to induce apoptosis in the infected cell via oxidative stress.46 Similarly, rhinovirus47 and baculovirus48 induce oxidative stress in the infected cell. More specifically, LEF3 (the SSB of baculovirus) shows a DNA-annealing effect in its oxidized state, whereas in the reduced state, its DNA-unwinding activity is favored. Cys214 is apparently involved in DNA binding; when mutated to serine, both DNA-binding and unwinding activities are reduced.49 It has been hypothesized that this cysteine could form an intermolecular disulfide bridge and thus results in LEF3 oligomers in solution. This could allow more DNA to bind in closer proximity, thus favoring the annealing effect.49 The E2 protein of bovine papilloma virus type 1 and ICP8 of herpes simplex virus type 1 also show DNA-binding activity depending on the redox state of the environment.50, 51, 52, 53\n",

            "text": "What is the relevance of these in vitro studies to the situation in the infected host cell? For several RNA viruses, including mouse hepatitis (corona)virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, it has been shown that viral replication is localized to double-membrane vesicles that have been hijacked from the endoplasmic reticulum or late endosomes.54, 55, 56, 57 These double-membrane vesicles are 200\u2013350 nm in diameter and present in the cytosol alone or as clusters.55 The milieu inside these vesicles or at their surface is unknown, but it is quite possible that it is partially oxidative. Since it is here that replicase proteins are produced at high levels, it is conceivable that the oxidized form of HCoV-229E Nsp9 is the dominant species. According to our findings, this form binds to ssRNA more tightly than does the reduced form, and could therefore promote replication of the viral genome. This speculation is supported by the recent report by Wu et al. 58 who have shown that oxidative stress in the host cell promotes HCoV-229E infectivity. Very likely, SARS-CoV will also induce oxidative stress in the infected host cell,59 even though its Nsp9 does not seem to form disulfide-linked dimers, at least not in vitro. The replicase of this virus may have other mechanisms to deal with an oxidative environment. We note that the number of cysteine residues is above average in coronavirus replicase proteins; in SARS-CoV, their share is 3.9% (HCoV 229E, 3.3%), whereas only 1.25% of residues in human cytosolic proteins are cysteine.60 In the SARS-CoV main proteinase (Mpro) alone, there are 12 cysteine residues (3.9% of all residues), whereas this number is 8 (2.6%) in HCoV-229E Mpro. Some of these could perhaps scavenge oxygen radicals, thereby undergoing oxidation to sulfenic, sulfinic, or even sulfonic acid.",

HCoV-229E Nsp9 and SARS-CoV Nsp9 have a theoretical pI of 9.3 and 9.1, respectively; thus, the protein is positively charged at the pH of the running buffer (8.3), whereas the nucleic acids are negatively charged and will move towards the opposite pole during electrophoresis. Therefore, only the oligonucleotides (100 \u03bcM) were loaded into the sample slots and run for 40 min at 100 mA and 4 \u00b0C. Subsequently, 50 \u03bcM protein was loaded into the respective lanes and the run was continued for another 40 min, with the poles of the electrodes interchanged. With this design of the experiment, the protein and the nucleic acid run in opposite directions and meet in the middle of the agarose gel. If there is interaction between the two, the protein will move in the same direction as the nucleic acid, whereas if there is no interaction, the protein will simply pass the nucleic acid. Gel mobility-shift assays were performed using a horizontal 1% agarose gel system at pH 8.3 in TBE buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 0.1 mM NaEDTA, pH 8.3 (25 \u00b0C) adjusted by the addition of acetic acid). The protein and DNA samples were mixed with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 10% (v/v) and a trace of bromophenol blue (BPB) dye. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 3.5% (w/v) \u03b1-sulfosalicilic acid, 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, until the dye turned yellow. At this stage, zones with higher concentrations of ligands such as oligonucleotide can be seen as a whitish area. For the detection of protein bands, the gel was washed for 15 min in 15% (v/v) ethanol, 8% (v/v) acetic acid, and stained for 30 min with 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue in the same solution with additional 10% (v/v) methanol.

For immobilization, 2 nM oligonucleotide was injected in manual mode until the desired amount of DNA on the surface was reached. To reduce non-specific binding of protein to the surface of the SA chip, the chip was activated with 50 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide and 200 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (NHS/EDC) and deactivated five times with 1 M ethanolamine. Saturation of residual free streptavidin-binding sites was achieved with 0.4% biotin. Unless mentioned specifically, all the injections were done at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl/min in the running buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (HBS-N)).
