Our model simulates the behavior of each individual in a population according to a probabilistic model through an inverse problem; we estimate the real number of recovered and infected people using mortality records. In addition, the model is dynamic in the sense that it takes into account the policy measures introduced when we solve the inverse problem. The results obtained in Spain have particular practical relevance: the number of infected individuals can be 17 times higher than the data provided by the Spanish government on April 26 th in the worst case scenario. Assuming that the number of fatalities reflected in the statistics is correct, 8 percent of the population may be contaminated or have already been recovered from the virus in Madrid, one of the most affected regions in Spain. However, if we assume that the number of fatalities is twice as high as the official numbers, the number of infections could have reached 19.5%. In Galicia, one of the regions where the effect has been the least, the number of infections does not reach 2.5 %. Based on our findings, we can: i) estimate the risk of a new outbreak before Autumn if we lift the quarantine; ii) may know the degree of immunization of the population in each region; and iii) forecast or simulate the effect of the policies to be introduced in the future based on the number of infected or recovered individuals in the population.",

In addition, the geographical dispersion of Castilla y Le\u00f3n is more significant (see Table 1 ).

The primary rationale for these discrepancies is the application of non-observational data analysis methods for a sample composed largely of elderly patients. In this sense, after carrying out our estimates taking into account the demographic structure of Spain and using the published articles that we believe reflect the reality in a more precise way, we estimate that the rate of asymptomatic patients ranges between 75 and 85 percent.

For each day t \u2208 D, we assume that the new infected population I 1 (t) \u2212 I 1 (t\u22121), is generated by the individual interaction of the susceptible people with infected patients and the recovered cases who can still contaminate. Formally, we assume that if a person can contaminate, it does so according to a random variable X \u223c Poisson(R i (t)), being R i (t) the average number of new infections that can cause each person in the day t. It is important to remark, that it is natural to assume that the function R i (t) follows a decreasing trend over time in our setting, basically for two reasons: i) quarantine policies have been systematically introduced along with different countries and regions. ii) the number of susceptible people decreases over time, while the number of infected people can increase. This all makes it more complicated to interact with a non-infected people. Once a new infected person arrives to the model (see Figure 13 ), we assume that the transitions between the different graph states are modeled by a probability law that verifies the following conditions: i) the transition probabilities are independent of the absolute instant when such transition takes place ii) the probabilities depend only on the current state of the patient regardless of the previous path in the graph. In particular, given the States = {I 1 , I 2 , I 3 , R 1 , R 2 , M }, and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1], we have: P(I 2 |I 1 ) = \u03b1, P(I 3 |I 1 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b1, P(M |I 3 ) = \u03b2, P(R 1 |I 3 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b2, P(I 3 |I 2 ) = 1, P(R 2 |R 1 ) = 1; all other transitions take a value equal to zero in probability.

Also, we must fit some parameters of the model to characterize the behavior of the study population. For this purpose, we use a sample of the deceased patients M 1 , M 2 ,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , M s of each day in the timeframe O = {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s}. Next, we suppose that our model (M ) is dependent on a vector of parameters \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) \u2208 R p1 \u00d7 R p2 (with p 1 + p 2 = p), where \u03b8 1 is a vector of dimension p 1 , defined in beforehand, and \u03b8 2 must be estimated from the sample. Furthermore, let us assume that the initial state of the system is characterized by S = (S(0), I 1 (0), I 2 (0), I 3 (0), R 1 (0), R 2 (0), M (0)) \u2208 N 7 and T = (T 1 (0), T 2 (0), T 3 (0), T 4 (0), T 5 (0), T 6 (0)) \u2208 N m \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 N m . S has the number of elements for each compartment of the model on day 0. T also contains the amount of remaining days to complete the transition they are in for each individual in the initial state, being m a integer number that represents the maximun numbers of registred days.",
