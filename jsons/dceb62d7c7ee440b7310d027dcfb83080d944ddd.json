Selwyn and colleagues (2003) found that older adults in England and Wales were more likely to use ICT if they had access to technology in home or family settings. Also, research has indicated that older adults are most likely to use ICT in order to stay in touch with family and friends (Carpenter & Buday, 2007; Vroman, Arthanat, & Lysack, 2015) . On the other hand, the major reasons older adults reported not using ICT were their disinterest or lack of motivation (Carpenter & Buday, 2007; Selwyn et al., 2003) . Some evidence has shown that older adults\" use of ICT was negatively associated with limited mobility (Gell et al., 2015; Wright & Hill, 2009) , memory, and visual acuity (Gell et al., 2015) .",

Some findings indicate that ICT use may increase protective factors for older adults\" mental health, such as reduced loneliness and increased social contacts. For example, studies have reported that going online was negatively associated with loneliness (Cotten, Anderson, & McCullough, 2013; Sum, Mathews, Hughes, & Campbell, 2008) , and reduced the probability of a depression state (Cotten, Ford, Ford, & Hale, 2014) . Also, as one of the common communication technologies, video chat was associated with lower risk of developing depression (Teo, Markwardt, & Hinton, 2018) . In a study of Taiwanese nursing home residents, depressive symptoms were decreased after a videoconference intervention that taught them how to use the Internet and to arrange videoconferencing appointments with their distant relatives (Tsai & Tsai, 2011) . Shapira, Barak, and Gal (2007) also found an improvement in older adults\" well-being, including feelings of depression and loneliness, in their ICT intervention study. They reasoned that learning how to use and communicate through ICT led to a psychological process of personal empowerment. Additionally, Fang and colleagues (2017) 6 examined an association between ICT use and psychological well-being (PWB) among adults aged 50 and above in Hong Kong. They found that ICT use was positively associated with PWB only among those aged 75 and over, and this relationship was further facilitated through contact with family members (Fang, Chau, Wong, Fung, & Woo, 2017) .",

In White and colleagues\" (2002) intervention study, older adults in nursing homes or congregate housing who were trained to use the Internet reported less loneliness, less depression, and more confidence compared to the control group, but the changes were not statistically significant. Moreover, Billipp (2001) found that interactive computer use with the right training conditions increased selfesteem and reduced depression in older adults, but the effect of interactions between the older adults and the computer-skills trainers was not factored into the analysis. Elliot and colleagues (2014) also found that ICT use was not associated with depression in older adults. As evidenced by the mixed outcomes in the literature, research has not yet revealed a consistent relationship between specific types of ICT uses and mental health status in the older adult population.",

Using mi estimate command, we estimated model F tests (equal fraction of missing information, FMI) from five data sets (i.e., each data set included a different imputed income variable from five imputed values, and other variables remained the same), and adjusted coefficients and S.E.s for the variability between imputations in multiple regression analysis (Table 3 ) and multinomial logistic regression analysis (Table 4 ). Confidence intervals (CI) were set at 95%. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the study sample. Respondents\" age ranged from 65 to 100, with a mean of 73.7 years.",

However, married or partnered older adults appear to be taking advantage of ICT at higher rates. There are two possible explanations for this outcome: (1) married or partnered older adults may help each other learn how to use ICT and subsequently increase their motivation to use this technology; and (2) it is also possible that older married or partnered couples may have a higher level of income or access to ample resources so that they can afford an Internet service and digital devices (e.g., computer, tablet, or smartphone).",

Perrin and Duggan (2015) reported little difference by gender for Internet use across all age groups. For older adults, Gell et al. (2015) found that men were more likely to use ICT, yet other studies found no significant association between gender and ICT use (Choi & Dinitto, 2013a , 2013b . A nuanced understanding of gender differences in ICT use can be achieved by investigating the older adult\"s purpose for ICT use. For example, our findings revealed that women were more likely to use only CT, whereas men were more likely to use only IT. These findings lend support for older women\"s ICT use more so for social rather than instrumental purposes (Ihm & Hsieh, 2015) . Moreover, older ICT users utilized technology for various purposes while IT users were limited to certain activities such as banking (44.2%), shopping (32%), and health conditioninformation search (36.2%). To increase older adult IT user\"s motives for utilizing technology that go beyond a single application for activities such as banking, a health-related mobile application (app) can be introduced so they can easily access health information without needing to execute complicated and multistep web searches. Additionally, to accommodate a CT user\"s context in which more than half (53.5%) texted or emailed on \"most\" days and 29.1% on \"some\" days in the past month, health care providers could send daily or weekly health-related information via text, email, or the institution\"s official mobile application. An easy-to-use app is feasible for both patients and institution because it can protect patients\" personal information while tailoring to each patient\"s healthrelated issue and delivery preference. Efforts to increase ICT use among older adults may initially need to be adjusted to the current and potential users\" main motivations for technology use before moving to a more integrated use of CT and IT.",

The present study revealed that ICT use was negatively associated with experiencing major depressive symptoms after controlling other covariates; however, it was not associated with experiencing mild depressive symptoms. Our finding regarding major depressive symptoms is in contrast to those of other studies that analyzed NHATS data and did not find a link between ICT use and depression (Choi & Dinitto, 2013b; Elliot et al., 2014) . Choi and Dinitto (2013a) found that low-income homebound older adults who reported a diagnosis of depression used the Internet more than older adults who were not depressed. The discrepancies between these findings may be attributed to differences in samples (e.g., community-based sample vs. low-income homebound older adults), respondent eligibility criteria, or analytic strategies. However, they highlight a need for further research regarding the relationship between ICT use and depressive symptoms in older adults. A more thorough understanding of the diversity in ICT use among older adults and its association with different levels of depressive symptoms may be used to support better access to mental health care services in this population by utilizing digital technology in the current health care system.",

More research needs to test potential moderating factors that may affect the relationships between technology use and physical and mental health status. Also, the ability of older adults to use ICT in this study may be due, in part, to their higher cognitive functioning based on their self-reported health status. As noted previously, the community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries in the current study are likely to have better health status than persons with more health care needs (e.g., homebound older adults, nursing home residents), or racial and ethnic minority older adults.

These interventions can consist of didactic and experiential learning exercises that will serve to enhance their self-efficacy (Davis, 1989; Kim et al., 2016) , reduce distrust in technology (Knowles & Hanson, 2018) , and leverage peer support to improve uptake (Kim et al., 2016) . These interventions will also focus on teaching older adults various ways that they can obtain health-related information, communicate with their health care provider, and become active participants in their care (selfmanagement). To make the learning exercises as successful and useful as possible, it is also recommended that older adults play a role in their design and implementation (Knowles & Hanson, 2018) . It is noteworthy that some older adults are limited to using technologies for only IT or CT purposes. Therefore, health care providers should consider the sociodemographic and health characteristics of their patients as they begin to integrate specific technologies into the health treatment plan. Then, based on the outcome of this simple technology use, they can eventually integrate ICT in the health management and treatment of older adult patients. Ultimately, the long-term goal is for health care programs to reduce the gaps between different levels of technology use as well as disparities between non-users and users in the older population through the gradual integration of technology into the overall treatment approach.",

Nursing professionals can play a pivotal role in facilitating epidemiological screening for older adults, those who would fall in a high-risk group for infection and mortality, using digital technology. ICT-based screening and consultation with nursing professionals can help older adults access adequate health-related information, engage in social/physical distancing while seeking proper medical behaviors, and reduce the likelihood of being potentially infected by avoiding interactions with multiple individuals. Also, ICT in this context would provide a lifeline to older adults who wish to communicate with their providers, help reduce social isolation, offer information and resources in addition to what is shared in the media, and promote a sense of agency by giving older adults resources to help them manage during a public health crisis.",

Therefore, these selection criteria may have excluded the most vulnerable older adults who have limited resources, complex health conditions, or language challenges. Second, the measures of CT use in the NHATS survey did not discriminate between emailing and texting. Third, other types of technology use, such as ebooks, Twitter, and other social networking sites, were not captured because the 2011 NHATS survey did not collect this information. Also, it did not factor in the level of accessibility (e.g., Wi-Fi speed) and mode of technology (i.e., smart phones, basic phones, computers, or tablets). Unlike the CT measure, the IT use variables (e.g., grocery shopping or contacting health care providers) measured only the respondents\" purposes of Internet usage, not the frequency of such activities. Fourth, the cross-sectional research design limits inferences regarding causality or exploring a bidirectional relationship between ICT use and health and depressive symptoms among older adults.",

The current study used data from the 2011 NHATS, which is comprised of the first cohort sample and the baseline data for the 2012-2014 NHATS. In 2015, the sample was replenished by adding an aged-in group, then this second cohort sample was used the second baseline data for the following 2016-2018 NHATS. Since our main research aim is to uncover ICT use patterns by levels and purposes, we selected to use first baseline data from the 2011 NHATS. By understanding ICT use patterns among older adults in the most available earlier cohort from the NHATS, the findings will be used as a groundwork for future research studies such as a trends study by comparing 2011 and 2015 NHATS, and panel studies using the follow-ups data in 2011-2014 NHATS.",

Studies have shown the benefit of nurse-led technology-based interventions among older adults in terms of reported user satisfaction, better quality of life and health status, and reduced nursing home admission and mortality (Chau et al., 2012; Rabins et al., 2000; Tappenden, Campbell, Rawdin, Wong, & Kalita, 2012) . Limited health care resources coupled with increased demand for health care services support the use of technology as an important supplement to traditional in-person interactions. By incorporating ICT into nursing practice, patients can benefit from access to high quality health information, prevention strategies, and frequent communication with their nurse. Timely assessments and interventions, and enhanced service coordination can be of consequences (While & Dewsbury, 2011) . Further, strengthening the patient-nurse relationship through 26 ICT use has the potential to improve the health outcomes of a population that is disproportionately affected by multiple chronic conditions, and provide vital access to health care services for older adults residing in rural settings.",

Also, the EHR can be used to remind patients about preventive or followup care, as well as provide patient-specific educational resources.

Our study points to disparities in older adults\" ICT use based on sociodemographic and health characteristics. In response to these disparities, health care providers need to obtain a holistic understanding of an older adult\"s health conditions, their technology use intentions, and their protective factors for maintaining health and mental health as they relate to differences in ICT use. Thus, provisions in the HITECH Act grant the authority to tailor older adults\" technology preferences by diversifying the information delivery system. Text, email, or mobile applications can be used as a delivery medium of choice for older adults given the complexity of conducting Internet searches and the possible resistance to using advanced technology. For example, reminders for preventive or follow-up care could be linked to the patients\" mobile calendar app, so 27 they could easily access such information. Also, a simple touch of an EHR mobile application can simplify the process in accessing relevant information along with training of the app operation from the hospital may increase accessibility and intimacy to ICT.",

Among sociodemographic variables, advanced age (OR = 0.98, CI: 0.97 -0.99; OR = 0.96, CI: 0.94 -0.97), being married or partnered (OR = 0.84, CI: 0.72 -0.98; OR = 0.69, CI: 0.54 -0.88), and level of educational attainment (OR = 0.91, CI: 0.84 -0.98; OR = 0.89, CI: 0.81 -0.97) were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing mild and major depressive symptoms, respectively. Cognitive function (OR = 0.72, CI: 0.66 -0.78; OR = 0.60, CI: 0.54 -068) was also associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing mild and major depressive symptoms, whereas having more chronic diseases (OR = 1.18, CI: 1.11 -1.25; OR = 1.24, CI: 1.16 -1.33) and worse physical capacity at the lower end (OR = 1.34, CI: 1.08 -1.68; OR = 2.03, CI: 1.54 -2.68) were associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing both mild and major depressive symptoms. Attending clubs or organized activities in the past month (OR = 0.44, CI: 0.65 -0.92; OR = 0.54, CI: 0.42 -0.69) was also associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing both mild and major depressive symptoms. Some covariates were differently associated with levels of depressive symptoms. For example, size of social network (OR = 1.09, CI: 1.03 -1.17) and a high level of physical capacity (OR = 0.59, CI: 0.48 -0.73) were associated with a likelihood of experiencing mild depressive symptoms. However, being male (OR = 1.34, CI: 1.03 -1.75), a paid employee (OR = 0.65, CI: 0.47 -16 0.89), walking for exercise (OR = 0.61, CI: 0.47 -0.79), and engaging in vigorous physical activity (OR = 0.50, CI: 0.38 -0.65) were",
