They serve individuals with severe opioid use disorder, providing a vital landing place for injection drug users, as well as a conduit for HIV testing and treatment [24]. Treatment provided in Opioid Treatment Programs is different than that of office-based medication treatment as: (1) Opioid Treatment Programs are the only settings in which methadone can be dispensed to treat opioid use disorder; and (2) they have highly regulated dispensaries in which patients come for frequent (i.e., daily for many patients), observed dosing. Longstanding regulations surrounding unsupervised (\u201ctake-home\u201d) medications are determined on a federal-level [25], and may be subject to further restrictions at the treatment program. The assumption is that daily or frequent supervised dosing enhances safety by reducing risk of medication poisonings and diversion. However, these same policies necessitate large numbers of patients congregating in small spaces for extended periods of time before dispersing to their communities, presenting challenges to infection control.",

The organization grappled with the dilemma of serving 2630 patients while attempting to minimize physical contact in cramped quarters. Evergreen Treatment Services not only provides medication treatment for opioid use disorder, but also offers an array of critical psychosocial and medical services including HIV screening and referral to treatment. This setting is comprised of three sites, the largest of which (n = 1380 patients) is located in Seattle, King County, a geographic region in which numerous COVID-19 cases were first identified. This urban site serves among the most vulnerable individuals in the community, with 13 patients known to be living with HIV and up to 63% reporting homelessness. For many patients, the Opioid Treatment Program is \u201chome base\u201d serving as a consistent setting in which to interface with a medical and counseling professionals, as well as a trusted source for referral to outside services like HIV treatment. Maintaining its core services, this clinic helps people reduce drug use and other HIV risk behaviors, solidifying its role in community HIV prevention.",

            "text": "At an Opioid Treatment Program, social distancing is made difficult by the reality that most patients engage in almost daily medication dosing. Phase II planning aimed to address this issue by modifying eligibility requirements for take-home doses, increasing the amount of take-homes provided, while balancing the risks of possible medication diversion and drug poisonings (both patients and community members). Opioid Treatment Programs cannot unilaterally relax take-home policies without submitting an exception request to the State Opioid Treatment Authority, housed at the Health Care Authority and SAMHSA\u2019s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. To begin this process, Evergreen Treatment Services proposed take-home status changes for five categories of methadone patients: (1) patients endorsing COVID-19 symptoms (assessed by medical provider) or confirmed disease receive up to 2 weeks of medication; (2) patients who have earned at least one take-home dose (garnered by demonstration of treatment stability using measures including negative urine drug tests and regular medication dosing) receive 1 week\u2019s worth of medication; (3) patients over 60 or with medical co-morbidities would be eligible for 1\u20132 weeks\u2019 worth of medication; (4) patients who are deemed unsafe to manage take-homes continue daily dosing; and (5) all other patients who are not in one of the above categories are put on a staggered take-home schedule whereby half the patients present in-person Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the other half on opposite days; remaining doses provided as take-homes. These categories were outlined in a comprehensive Infection Control Response document, which was submitted to SAMHSA as a supporting document for the exception. At the same time, the Health Care Authority was working with the Governor\u2019s Office and the Washington State Congressional delegation to bring attention to the list of urgent policy exceptions that had been requested to assure programs had the flexibility they needed to safely protect staff and patients. On 3/13/2020, SAMHSA released Evergreen Treatment Services\u2019 infection response document as guidance for all Washington State Opioid Treatment Programs [26], after which the exemption was approved and implemented. On 3/16/2020 SAMHSA released adjusted rules governing Opioid Treatment Programs, allowing states to: (1) request blanket exceptions for all stable patients to receive 28-day take-home dosing and; (2) request up to 14-day take-home dosing for less stable patients, but who the Opioid Treatment Program believes can safely handle that level [27].",

            "text": "In practice, the most complicated elements of implementing infection control response have been determining which patients are \u201cunstable\u201d. Medical providers make determinations around patient stability on a case-by-case basis, some of which are clearly articulated within the documentation parameters, such as an inability to safely take safely medication daily due to a cognitive or psychiatric condition, or inability to keep medication safe due to a chaotic living situation. Yet numerous cases required lengthy and ongoing consultation among medical providers and clinical leadership. For example, individuals living with HIV are some of the most medically complicated patients at the Opioid Treatment Program. Maintaining this group in opioid treatment services is critical not only in terms of lowering the likelihood of injection drug use, but also to maintain the connection these patients have to clinic medical and other treatment staff, who can encourage adherence to ART or link these individuals to HIV treatment and services. Decisions on take-home dosing for patients with HIV were reviewed on a case-by-case basis that balanced patients\u2019 vulnerability to COVID-19 with risks posed by providing potentially unstable patients with large doses of methadone. These discussions revolved around key risk factors, heavily emphasizing drug poisoning risks (e.g., recent drug poisoning events; documented drug impairment incidents). During the COVID-19 outbreak, standard tools for safety monitoring are suspended, namely drug testing is considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d, and breathalyzing is an aerosolizing activity that increases the risk of contagion. The guiding principle for decision making is safety of the patients and public, both in terms of infectious disease risk, as well as from a medication diversion standpoint. We continue to explore medication diversion prevention; at the time of this writing, the clinic is implementing a pilot of a smartphone app which will allow video-directly observed therapy [28].",

The percentage of on-site visits given that day\u2019s census was calculated for each day of the time period. Before COVID-19, an average of 61.9% of patients were on site for dosing; this dropped to 31.1%, representing a 49.2% decrease.

            "text": "Our initial effort encapsulates lessons learned from one Opioid Treatment Program when rapid implementation of new policies takes place in the face of extenuating circumstances. Namely, despite decades of mandates requiring supervised methadone dosing visits, policies were rapidly changed during a national crisis in order to ensure uninterrupted access to methadone while balancing efforts to mitigate COVID-19 risk. Our experience highlights that organization-level decisions can be made quickly, resulting in both the reduction in the number of persons on site by almost half, as well as a slight increase in the overall census. An unexpected bright spot of COVID-19 is the opportunity to formally evaluate a set of forcibly changed standard practices that have been called out for reform [29]. The effects of providing extended take-homes is unknown, and future research will be needed to study the effects of these changes on methadone-implicated poisonings, mortality, treatment retention, and HIV-risk behaviors and outcomes. As the pandemic evolves, we may find more people in need of opioid treatment due to reductions in drug supply, economic downturn, or other unpredictable eventualities. Increases in Opioid Treatment Program censuses, as was the case for Evergreen Treatment Services in the past month, will also bring more opportunities for these programs to provide HIV screening, testing, and linkage to treatment, a vital role that this setting can serve for opioid users.",
