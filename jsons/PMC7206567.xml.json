While disaster and emergency response plans are inherently limited and not implemented in practice as intended (Clarke, 1999), stakeholder organizations\u2019 responses may be performed together with presumed structures, particularly in a setting in which government entities are predominant. For example, the Incident Command System (ICS)3 was designed to improve response work\u2019s efficiency by constructing a standard operating procedure (Moynihan, 2009). Structurally, one person serves as the incident commander who is responsible for directing all other responders (Kapucu & Garayev, 2016). ICS is a somewhat hierarchical command-and-control system with functional arrangements in five key resources and capabilities\u2014that is, command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance (Kapucu & Garayev, 2016). In an environment in which such an emergency response model is implemented, it is realistic to expect clusters and subgroups to reflect the model\u2019s structural designs and arrangements, and they may be intentionally designed to facilitate coordination, communication, and collaboration with other parts or subgroups efficiently in a large response network.",

During these responses, public organizations in different jurisdictions participate, and a sizable number of organizations from nongovernmental sectors also become involved (Celik & Corbacioglu, 2016; Comfort & Haase, 2006; Kapucu et al., 2010; Spiro, Acton, & Butts, 2013). Organizational participation by multiple government levels and sectors is often necessary because knowledge, expertise, and resources are distributed in society. Participating organizations must collaborate and coordinate their efforts. However, studies have suggested that interactions in ERNs are limited and primarily occur among similar organizations, particularly within the same jurisdiction. That is, public organizations tend to interact more frequently with other public organizations in specific geographic locations (Butts et al., 2012; Hossain & Kuti, 2010; Kapucu, 2005; Tang, Deng, Shao, & Shen, 2017). These studies indicate that organizations have been insufficiently integrated across government jurisdictions (Tang et al., 2017) or sectors (Butts et al., 2012; Hossain & Kuti, 2010), and the identification of cliques composed of similar organizations reinforces such a concern.",

Here, we use the term interorganizational relations to refer to both intergovernmental and intersectoral relations. Intergovernmental relations refer to the interaction among organizations across different government levels (local, provincial, and national), and intersectoral relations involve the interaction among organizations across different sectors (public, private, nonprofit, and civic sectors). Recent studies have suggested that both intergovernmental and intersectoral relations shape ERNs (Kapucu et al., 2010; Kapucu & Garayev, 2011; Tang et al., 2017), but few have analyzed the way the two interorganizational relations intertwine. If the relation interdependencies in the entire network are of interest to ERN researchers, as is the case in this article, focusing on cliques may not necessarily be the best approach to the question because clique analysis may continue to find sets of selected organizations that are tightly linked for various reasons.",

            "text": "The analysis of cliques is a very strict way of operationalizing cohesive subgroups from a social network perspective (Moody & Coleman, 2015), and there are two issues with using it to identify cohesive subgroups in ERNs. First, clique analysis assumes complete connections of three or more subgroup members, while real-world networks tend to have many small overlapping cliques that do not represent distinct groups (Moody & Coleman, 2015). Even if substantively meaningful cliques appear, they may not necessarily imply a lack of information flow across subgroups or other organizations\u2019 exclusion, as previous ERN studies have assumed (Comfort & Haase, 2006; Kapucu et al., 2010). Second, clique analysis assumes no internal differentiation in members\u2019 structural position within the subgroup (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). In a task-oriented network such as an ERN, organizations within a subgroup may look similar (e.g., all fire organizations). However, this does not imply that they are identical in their structural positions. When these assumptions in clique analysis do not hold, identifying cohesive subgroups as cliques is inappropriate (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). Similarly, other clique-like approaches (n-cliques and k-cores) demand an answer to the question: \u201cWhat is the n- or k-?\u201d The clique and clique-like approaches have a limited ability to define and identify cohesive subgroups in a task-oriented network because they do not clearly explain why the subgroups need to be defined and identified in such a manner. We proposed a different way of thinking about and finding subsets of organizations in ERNs: community.",

Network researchers have developed methods with which to detect communities (Fortunato, Latora, & Marchiori, 2004; Latora & Marchiori, 2001; Lim, Kim, & Lee, 2016; Newman & Girvan, 2004; Yang & Leskovec, 2014). Optimization approaches, such as the Louvain and Leiden methods, which we use in this article, sort nodes into communities by maximizing a clustering objective function (e.g., modularity). Beginning with each node in its own group, the algorithm joins groups together in pairs, choosing the pairs that maximize the increase in modularity (Moody & Coleman, 2015). This method performs an iterative process of node assignments until modularity is maximized and leads to a hierarchical nesting of nodes (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008). Recently, the Louvain algorithm was upgraded and improved as the Leiden algorithm that addresses some issues in the Louvain algorithm (Traag, Waltman, & van Eck, 2018).",

Organizations that have different information, skills, and resources may frequently interact in a disruptive situation because one type alone, such as the government or organizations in an affected area, cannot cope effectively with the event (Waugh, 2003).

Thus, the relations among organizations become dense and evolve into the community in which every member is connected. On the other hand, a community in the task network may not require all of the organizations within it to interact. For example, if a presumed structure is strongly established, organizations are more likely to interact with others within the planned structure following the chain of command and control. Even without such a structure, government organizations may coordinate their responses following the existing chain of command and control in their routine.

The scale of ERNs in large disasters and emergencies is noteworthy (Moynihan, 2009; Waugh, 2003), and over 1,000 organizations appeared in Butts et al. (2012) study as well as in this research. Their connections reflect both existing structural forms by design and by emergent needs. The computational power needed to analyze such large relational data is ever higher and the methods simpler now, which allows us to learn about the entire network.",

This observation does not speak to the quality of interactions in the centralized top-down structure, but one can also ask how effective such a structure can be in a setting where diverse organizations must share authority, responsibilities, and resources. Second, infectious diseases spread rapidly and can break out in multiple locations simultaneously. The subgroup patterns in response networks to infectious diseases can differ from those of location-bound natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. While some organizations may not be actively or directly involved in the response, communities of these organizations can be formed to prepare for potential outbreaks or provide support to the core response communities during the event.",

ERNs\u2019 effective structure has been a fundamental question and a source of continued debate (Kapucu et al., 2010; Nowell, Steelman, Velez, & Yang, 2018). The answer remains unclear, but the recent opinion leans toward a less centralized and hierarchical structure, given the complexity of making decisions in disruptive situations (Brooks, Bodeau, & Fedorowicz, 2013; Comfort, 2007; Hart, Rosenthal, & Kouzmin, 1993). Our analysis shows clearly that the community structure and structures within communities in the network were highly centralized (several mushrooms) and led by central government organizations. Given that the response to the outbreak was severely criticized for its poor communication and lack of coordination, it might be beneficial to include more flexibility and openness in the response system in future events. We suggest taking advice from the literature above conservatively because of the contextual differences in the event and setting.",

Some algorithms take deterministic group finding approaches that partition the network based on betweenness centrality edges (Girvan & Newman, 2002) or information centrality edges (Fortunato et al., 2004). Other algorithms take the optimization approaches we use in this article. In our side analyses, we tested three algorithms with the same data set: G-N, Louvain, and Leiden. The modularity scores were consistent, as reported in this article, but the number of communities in G-N and the other two algorithms differed. The deterministic group finding approach (G-N) found a substantively high number of communities. The modularity score can help make sense of the partition initially, but the approach is limited (Reichardt & Bornholdt, 2006). Thus, two questions remain: which algorithm do we choose and how do we know whether the community structure is robust (Karrer, Levina, & Newman, 2008)? In their nature, these questions do not differ from which statistical model to use given the assumptions and types of data in hand. The algorithms also require further examination and tests.",
