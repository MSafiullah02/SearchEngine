This transferability allows for adversarial attacks without the knowledge of the structure and parameters of the target model. Existing black-box attack methods focus on improving the transferability of adversarial examples across different models under the assumption that attackers can obtain the training data on which the target models are trained [3, 4, 7]. Attackers firstly train a substitute model on the same training data, and then generate adversarial examples in the white-box manner. The perturbations crafted for substitute model can thus fool target model, since different models learn similar decision boundaries on the same training set [4, 7].",

Our method is to craft data-free perturbations that can fool the target model without any knowledge about the data distribution (e.g., the number of categories, type of data, etc.). We utilize such a property that the features extracted from different models are usually similar, since most models are fine-tuned from common pre-trained model weights [8]. Therefore, we establish a mapping connection between fine-tuned model and pre-trained model. Instead of optimizing an objective that reduces the score of the predicted labels [3, 4], we propose to learn adversarial perturbations that can disturb the internal representation. Our proposed attack method views the logit outputs of pre-trained model as the extracted internal representation, and iteratively maximizes the divergence between clean images and their adversarial examples measured in this representation space. Because of the mapping connection, pre-trained model and fine-tuned model are similar in the internal representation and adversarial examples will successfully mislead target model with high probability.",

Experimental results show that on the real-world black-box setting, our method achieves significant attacking success rates. In this practical setting of black-box attack scenario, only universal adversarial perturbation methods can be applied since they are image-agnostic methods. Compared with universal adversarial perturbations (UAP) [12] and generalizable data-free universal adversarial perturbations (GD-UAP) [13], the proposed method has the following advantages. First, our method outperforms UAP and GD-UAP by 8.05% and 6.00%. Second, UAP requires a number of training samples to converge when crafting an image-agnostic perturbation and GD-UAP also need to know the distribution of training data to achieve better performance. In contrast, our method generates adversarial perturbations without knowing the data distribution. Third, the proposed method does not need training phase. The perturbation can be obtained by a single back-propagation, whereas UAP and GD-UAP need to train universal perturbation until it converges.",

These two image-agnostic universal adversarial perturbations can effectively attack under real-world black-box setting.

The horizontal axis represents categories in ImageNet, and vertical axis represents the proportion of test images in the cosmetic insurance dataset that is classified as categories in horizontal axis. For example, by evaluating test images belonging to chat record category, there are 35% images classified as category \u201ccaldron\u201d in ImageNet, which has no relationship with chat record.",

Our method does not need to utilize any training data sample, and we propose to generate perturbations that can disturb the internal representation. Finally, we demonstrate that our objective of crafting data-free adversarial perturbations is effective to fool target model without knowing training data distribution or the architecture of models.
