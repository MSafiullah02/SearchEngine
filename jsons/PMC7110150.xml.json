The results from these studies suggest that there is a single peak in infectiousness occurring approximately 7\u201310 days after symptom onset, with relatively little transmission occurring prior to 5 days post-symptom-onset. While the results of the present analysis support previous findings that an increase in infectiousness occurs approximately 1 week after symptom onset, they suggest that there may also be an early peak in transmission, with a number of contacts being infected soon after symptom onset in the index case(s).",

Previous studies found similar household member attack rates in the two countries (12, 15). However, the analysis from Singapore included both hospital- and community-based exposures. Time from symptom onset to isolation declined markedly over the course of the Singapore epidemic (2), so the association between long time-to-isolation and transmission to secondary cases would have been strongly confounded by any other control measures, including those for nonhousehold transmission, that became more effective over time. Primary-case patients who were isolated 5 or more days after symptom onset may have been the major contributors to nosocomial transmission\u2014which accounted for 76 percent of SARS infections in Singapore (16)\u2014either because such cases tended to occur earlier in the epidemic when hospitals had yet to institute a policy of isolation for SARS patients (2) or because such patients had a less severe clinical presentation and thus hospital employees adopted fewer precautions upon their admission.",

The slight increase in transmission from low-LDH index patients around day 10 is consistent with the timing of peak viremia (17). Similarly, the higher probability of transmission from elderly index patients may be due to the increased infectiousness of these persons or the increased susceptibility of their contacts. Older index patients were twice as likely to have high LDH levels (unpublished data). Furthermore, assessment of the age distribution of SARS cases revealed an excess of cases in the elderly (6, 19), suggesting that they were more susceptible to infection.

Further, we assumed that all SARS index patients faithfully reported their date of symptom onset and identified all of their contacts. Incomplete contact tracing might have been a problem early in the epidemic, and some SARS patients might have underreported their contacts because they were too sick to answer questions or because they were reluctant to do so after policies such as quarantine were instituted. However, the average number of contacts per index case did not appear to vary with time to hospitalization (table 1), suggesting that such bias would have had a minimal effect on the observed pattern of transmission. Finally, the possible tendency of family members to report to the hospital only after more than one family member had become ill might have led to a spurious association between time to hospitalization and infectiousness.
