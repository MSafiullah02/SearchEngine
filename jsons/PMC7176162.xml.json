This cleavage causes a conformational change in the spike structure, which then exposes other attachment sites on the surface glycoprotein. The virus is then attached to host receptors on enterocytes, and the entry process begins. The outer capsid shell is removed, and double-layered particles are inserted into the cytoplasm. These particles produce capped viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are then displaced from the transcribing particles into the cell cytoplasm. There, they are then translated into proteins and replicated to new genomic RNA. This viral replication process is unique and occurs in viroplasms, electron-dense structures near the cell nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum. Newly assembled particles with newly replicated dsRNA bud into the endoplasmic reticulum from the viroplasm and are equipped with outer capsid proteins. Fully developed virus particles are released from enterocytes via cell lysis or delivery of particles to the apical plasma membrane of cells.",

Since 1983, multiple candidate vaccines have been tried. Initially, vaccines based upon the use of animal rotavirus strains that are not pathogenic in humans failed to provide sufficient clinical protection. Rotashield (Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines, Philadelphia, PA), a tetravalent simian/human reassortant rotavirus vaccine, was licensed by the FDA in 1998, based upon data showing an 80\u2013100% protection against dehydrating rotavirus diarrhea. Within 9 months of its release, the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reported 15 cases of intussusception in infants who had received the vaccine. Subsequent case control and retrospective cohort studies verified a temporal association. The relative risk for intussusception within 2 weeks following the first vaccine dose exceeded 20 in both studies, prompting the vaccine\u2019s withdrawal from the market.",

RotaTeq\u2122 (Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA, 2008) is a pentavalent human\u2013bovine reassortant, with a low rate of replication in the human gastrointestinal tract and a low rate of fecal shedding. Large phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that both Rotarix\u2122 and RotaTeq\u2122 are well tolerated. They have also been demonstrated to be immunogenic and highly efficacious, preventing 74\u201387% of all cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis and greater than 85% of those associated with severe diarrhea. In Africa and Asia, where more than 85% of rotavirus associated deaths occur, RotaTeq\u2122 vaccination reduced cases of severe rotavirus diarrhea by greater than 50% during the first year of life when the disease burden and mortality is greatest. The World Health Organization\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts declared that rotavirus vaccines should be included in national immunization programs worldwide, particularly in nations with high diarrheal fatalities. Diarrhea-associated deaths in these developing countries could be reduced by 25%.",
