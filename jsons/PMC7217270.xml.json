Airway epithelial response to viral infection is release of various cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF).[5] High IL-6 levels are associated with disease severity, but ablation of IL-6 signaling, by IL-6 receptor antibodies, can lead to uncontrolled virus replication resulting in greater mortality.[6] TNF-\u03b1, on the other hand, leads to impair viral replication, enhances cytotoxic activity and cytokine production by leukocytes, and activates endothelial cells.[7] Elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 have been associated with greater morbidity during infection with highly pathogenic virus, and blocking activity of TNF-\u03b1 attenuates immune- mediated pathology.",

As a therapeutic intervention, individualizing dosing will likely be a crucial element in optimizing the potential of an antioxidant strategy.[24]",
