The tax that our immune systems have evolved to deal with is the tax of infection, of parasitism by simpler life forms. With slow-growing, complex organisms like the vertebrates, our particular concern is the excessive tax levied by pathogens that replicate and (in some cases) mutate with extraordinary rapidity.",

Some viruses can survive for time in the external environment if, say, they are located in sloughed cells protected by mucus (foot-and-mouth disease virus is a case in point), though all ultimately rely on strategies requiring further infection and replication in naive hosts that allow high levels of virus production to facilitate transmission. In the case of measles virus or poliovirus that means other humans, but we are only incidental hosts for the hantaviruses (Hantan and Korean hemorrhagic fever viruses) that are maintained in Apodemus species. Other viruses (like dengue) replicate in both mosquitoes and humans, whereas the broadly related Japanese encephalitis virus will multiply in pigs, mosquitoes, and man.",

Such viruses transmit via sporadic reactivation to lytic phase as, for example, in the cold sores caused by Herpes simplex virus, or the oropharyngeal production of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Thomas D\u00f6rner and Andreas Radbruch look at the secreted, circulating, and locally produced immunoglobulins (Igs) that have at least the potential to neutralize virus at the point of mucosal entry, the holy grail for vaccinologists. Their discussion of the balance between established memory, circulating Ig, and recall responses has particular relevance for immunization strategies. Antibody-mediated immunity can be extraordinarily long lived, reflecting the persistence of both B cell memory and plasma cells located in the bone marrow (Crotty et al., 2003).",

As a consequence, starting from the partially differentiated naive, postthymic precursor, the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response provides an extraordinarily accessible target for the analysis of immune repertoire selection (Turner et al., 2006) and the progressive acquisition of diverse molecular expression profiles that characterize fully functional effector cells (Johnson et al., 2003, Peixoto et al., 2007), TCM and TEM memory cells, and so forth. Kaech and Wherry focus particularly on the nature of these lymphocyte subsets and the factors influencing the underlying cell-fate decisions, introducing a burgeoning area of molecular and cellular analysis. As this research proceeds, it's important to bear in mind, of course, that even for T cell clones expanded from a single precursor, we are working with populations rather than direct mother-to-daughter lineages.",

Through the course of evolutionary time we would, as implied in the discussion by Steven Deeks and Bruce Walker, select a human population that lives happily with HIV. Socially, of course, we could never accept the massive dieback in the human family that this would involve. Even so, some of the most promising avenues for developing novel possibilities for HIV control lie in determining how the inherent genetic resistance mechanisms described by Deeks and Walker work at the molecular and cellular levels. As those of us who are involved in the Centre for HIV and AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) vaccine grant administered by Barton Haynes at Duke University, realize, we have to go back to analyzing the basics of virus transmission, genetic resistance, and the earliest phases of both innate and adaptive immune responsiveness if we are to develop novel conceptual and technical strategies for defeating this virus.",

It is salutary for immunologists to reflect that, with the exception of the very successful human papilloma virus vaccine developed by the immunologist Ian Frazer and colleagues (Liu et al., 1998), the enormous intellectual advances that we have made in understanding the nature of specific host responsiveness have so far had little impact on immunization. Of course, that might be in the process of changing as we incorporate new molecular strategies gained from the analysis of the innate immunity into product design, but we should be modest when we recall that we still have no effective vaccines to protect children in the developing world against infection with malaria species. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
