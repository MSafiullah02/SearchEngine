The TGA resin (substitution 0.3 mmol/g) was used as the solid-phase support, and syntheses were performed on a scale of 100 \u03bcmol. All amino acids, 4 equivalents relative to resin loading, were coupled according to the TBTU/HOBT/DIEA method: 1 equivalent of Fmoc-amino acid, 1 equivalent of TBTU, 1 equivalent of HOBT (1 M HOBT in DMF) and 2 equivalents of DIEA (2 M DIEA in DMF). The Fmoc-protecting group was removed with 30% piperidine in DMF (v/v). Peptides were fully deprotected and cleaved from the resin by hydrofluoric acid treatment (89% TFA solution containing 5.5% thioanisole, 3.3% ethandithiol and 2.2% anisole as scavengers); the crude peptides were precipitated with ice-cold ethyl ether, filtered, re-dissolved in water and lyophilised. The crude peptides were purified to homogeneity by preparative reverse-phase highpressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Waters Delta Prep 3000 chromatographic system, equipped with an UV Lambda Max Mod. 481 detector. The samples were injected on a Jupiter (Phenomenex) C18 column (21.20 mm \u00d7 25 cm, 15 \u03bcm) eluted with a H2O/0.1% TFA (A) and CH3CN/0.1% TFA (B) solvent mixture.

[19] reported that RSV infection caused two separate peaks of ERK activity both immediately following viral binding (10-30 min) and later during active viral replication (24-48 h) matched by activation of multiple PKC isoforms. Among such kinases, the PKC superfamily is responsible for diverse regulatory roles in many cellular processes and has also been implicated in virus entry. In fact, the entry of several enveloped viruses, including rhabdoviruses, alphaviruses, herpesviruses and influenza virus, requires PKC activation upon binding to host cell surface receptors [1, 28].",
