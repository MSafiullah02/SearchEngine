More than one study reported a significant decrease in acute coronary syndrome admissions during that pandemic which is still due to unknown reasons. Methods. This is a retrospective non-controlled multi-centered study of 180 patients (117 males and 63 females) with acute coronary syndrome (STEMI and NSTEMI) A total of 113 patients (61.9% males, 38.1% females) with a mean age of 72.3\u00b114.2 presented during March/April 2019 with ACS (STEMI + NSTEMI) while only 67 (70.1% males, 29.9% females ) COVID 19 negative patients with a mean age of 65.1\u00b114.5 presented during the same period (March/April) in 2020. This is a drop by 40.7% (p < 0.05) of total ACS cases during the COVID 19 pandemic. In NSTEMI patients, 36.4% presented late (>24 hours of symptoms) during the COVID 19 pandemic in comparison with 2019 (27.1%, p = 0.033). Conclusion. The COVID 19 pandemic led to a substantial drop by 40.7% (p < 0.05) of total ACS admissions in our area. This decrease in hospital admissions and late presentations can be a worrisome sign for an increase in future complications of myocardial infarctions.",

This phenomenon has been seen in multiple countries and thought to be due to multiple factors including hesitance of patients to visit the hospitals despite initial symptoms, better medication adherence, lower pollution levels, less smoking, and less physical strain. [6, 7] The spread of the virus has led to stay-at-home orders from almost all states across the country. In New York State these orders were given on March 22nd, 2020. The first positive case of COVID-19 in Broome County, located in the southern tier of New York State, was on March 17th, 2020. [8] Our retrospective study investigates the impact that COVID-19 has had on the amount of ST elevation myocardial infarctions and non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions within our area during March and April of 2020. The diagnostic criteria for STEMI in this study were new ST elevation at the J point in at least 2 contiguous leads with \u22652 mm (0.2 mV) in men or \u22651.5 mm (0.15 mV) in women in leads V2-V3 and/or of \u22651 mm (0.1 mV) in other contiguous chest leads. The presence of a new LBBB with anginal symptoms was also considered diagnostic of STEMI. NSTEMI was defined as elevated troponin levels with anginal symptoms. Ischemic ECG changes may be present but are not required for the diagnosis.",

This is a significant drop by 48.2% (p< 0.05) of total NSTEMI cases during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Most likely due to the hesitance of patients to visit hospitals despite initial symptoms, but can also be due to misdiagnosis of ACS (since patients can present with cough and shortness of breath due to pulmonary edema) in the setting of multiple COVID 19 admissions, difficult transportation due to lockdowns in multiple countries and cities, better medication adherence, lower pollution levels, less smoking, and less physical strain. [6, 7] Overall, this decrease in ACS admissions is worrisome, and it may reflect a later increase in acute and subacute myocardial infarction complications that result in increased morbidity and mortality.",
