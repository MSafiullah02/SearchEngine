But often the overall health-care infrastructure, not just the delivery of intensive care, is unavailable. This fact makes it difficult to examine the true impact of a lack of ICU beds. However, other countries, such as the United Kingdom, provide universal health coverage, and yet have approximately one-sixth the ICU beds (three per 100,000 population) compared with the United States (\u223c20 per 100,000 population).1 Studies of intensive care in Britain, described later, allow us to understand at least some of the impact of such low provision of ICU beds per capita.3, 4, 5, 6\n",

Of these, 168 were refused admission to an ICU at that time, and of these, 94 (56%) did not receive intensive care specifically because of the lack of available beds. Overall, the patients who were refused admission were noted to have a higher 90-day mortality (46%) than patients who received intensive care (37%). Sinuff et al11 systematically reviewed 10 studies and found an overall odds of death of 3.04 (95% CI, 1.49-6.17) for patients refused admission compared with those admitted to an ICU. However, many of these studies had the recurring problem of mixing together patients refused admission specifically because of a lack of beds (inappropriate refusal) with patients who were refused admission for other reasons (appropriate refusal), such as perceived futility of intensive care. These patients will naturally have high death rates and confound data interpretation.",

A study comparing medical admissions to the ICU in the United States and United Kingdom demonstrated that the mean time to arriving in the ICU after admission to the hospital was substantially longer in the United Kingdom.12 Many more patients were also admitted from the wards rather than directly from an ED. Because data suggest that early intervention may improve outcomes, particularly for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock,13, 14 these delays may be detrimental for patients. For example, in a study of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in the ED, patients who had delayed transfer to the ICU (defined as transfer to the wards and then to the ICU on day 2 or 3 of the hospital stay vs directly from the ED) had substantially increased hospital mortality (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.12-3.85).15 A similar study by Chalfin et al16 of patients who stayed in the ED for > 6 h vs those transferred to the ICU in < 6 h found that delayed admission increased the risk of hospital death and longer hospital stay.",

Although one in five Americans who die receive intensive care, only one in 20 experience intensive care in the United Kingdom.3 The percentage of deaths that involve intensive care among children and young adults is similar in both countries, but the percentages diverge for elderly patients, with very few age > 85 years receiving intensive care before death in the United Kingdom.

Although the costs associated with care should not be equated with quality, the two often must be balanced. There is some correlation between the provision of ICU beds per capita and health-care spending per capita across countries in North America and Western Europe.1 Many studies of intensive care equate decreasing ICU length of stay with cost savings, but these savings are likely only realized if decreasing ICU length of stay leads to decreases in the number of ICU beds and fewer patients cared for in those beds or, alternatively, by having few beds to begin with.18 This is due to the majority of costs in the ICU being fixed costs of care (salaries, costs of equipment, etc), which often are estimated to account for up to 80% to 85% of the total costs.19, 20 Therefore, minimizing the operating costs by having few beds generally will lower overall costs of care.",

But the study also concluded that there were decreasing marginal returns above average intensity and that those returns were further attenuated with longer follow-up.

In the United Kingdom, Pearse et al30 found that high-risk patients representing 12.5% of total surgical procedures accounted for 80% of surgical deaths and noted that only 15% of these patients were admitted to an ICU. A direct comparison of outcomes among high-risk surgical patients in a single hospital in the United States vs a single hospital in the United Kingdom found a fourfold increased risk of death in the UK cohort, even after risk adjustment.31 The hospitals compared in the two countries served very different patient populations, raising the possibility of unknown confounders. However, the higher use of intensive care in the United States may at least partially explain the differences in mortality.",

Data from US studies of intensive care demonstrate low overall severity of illness and report mechanical ventilation rates of only 10% to 30%, with many patients admitted to US ICUs purely for monitoring.12, 32 In a model developed to identify patients in the United States who may not need ICU admission, 38.5% of all ICU admissions were for monitoring purposes, and only 11.5% of these patients went on to require any form of active treatment (defined using the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System),32 suggesting that > 30% of ICU patients in the United States never require any ICU-level interventions. Another study of > 240,000 US patients in the ICU found that < 30% of the patients were mechanically ventilated and that < 25% received vasopressors.33 Data are lacking on whether admission of patients to the ICU for monitoring improves outcomes in any way. A number of observational studies of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy concluded that default admission of patients to the ICU for monitoring purposes did not improve outcomes but increased costs of care and length of hospital stay.34, 35 The concerns of iatrogenic complications,36 risk of ICU-acquired infections,37 immobilization,38 and communication gaps associated with additional ICU admission and discharge39, 40 may all be underappreciated risks of intensive care, particularly for patients at low risk of death (Fig 2).",

Such alignment does not require any rationing of care but does require more-aggressive measures by health-care workers to address end-of-life preferences early to ensure the most appropriate care.42, 43 With high availability of ICU beds, it often may be easier for clinicians to avoid the question and continue to treat. We know, for example, that it is not just variation in patient preferences that explain large regional variations in end-of-life spending across the United States.9 However, recent data suggest that use of advance directives specifying limitations in end-of-life care do reduce the likelihood of in-hospital death and increase use of hospice care in regions with high overall end-of-life spending.44\n",

In an idealized system with no cost constraints, spending on intensive care would be a separate concern. However, every health-care system faces budgetary restrictions that are associated with the delivery of care.45 In our current system with escalating health-care costs, large numbers of ICU beds represent an expensive fixed cost for hospitals and a large part of societal costs of health care, particularly in the United States.20 Recent efforts to quantify the costs of intensive care in the United States as a percentage of hospital costs estimated that intensive care represented between 17.4% and 39.0% of all hospital costs46 and that critical care now accounts for 0.66% of the US gross domestic product.26 The system may also develop a spiraling cost cycle. As the percentage of ICU beds relative to hospital beds increases, there may be substantial delays in finding a ward bed for an ICU patient. With delayed discharge comes further cost for the higher level care that is not needed.4\n",

Does this happen? England provides us with a test case of this possibility at the low end of the curve. Based on data generated during the 1990s, it became apparent that there was a significant lack of ICU beds across the country.5, 6 Beginning in 2000, the Department of Health worked to modernize critical care, with increased expenditure and a 35% increase in the number of staffed beds in general ICUs over 5 years\u2014a substantially greater rate of growth than for the underlying population.4 Of note, the majority of these new beds were level 2 beds with two-to-one nursing rather than level 3 beds with one-to-one nursing and the ability to provide a full range of organ support. The predicted mortality for patients admitted to the ICUs decreased by only 0.7% over this time period, suggesting that there was a previously unmet need for intensive care as the severity of illness remained relatively steady. But the changes in actual mortality were striking, with a steady decrease in the relative risk of both ICU and hospital mortality starting in 2003 to 2004 and continuing through 2006. Moreover, there was a significant drop in the percentage of patients who were identified as being discharged from the ICU too early. Other intensive care initiatives were implemented over a similar time period, including a ventilator bundle in many hospitals, an increase in the number of rapid response teams in hospitals to identify deteriorating patients, and the establishment of critical care networks. Therefore, changes in outcomes may not be attributable solely to changes in the availability of beds.4\n",

One older study examined ICU admission decisions during variable periods of ICU bed availability in a single center. The authors found that severity of illness of patients admitted to the ICU increased with decreasing availability of beds, and although patients were discharged sooner from the ICU under crowded conditions, there was no discernible difference in outcomes.47 However, the study authors were unable to comment on the patients who were denied ICU admission. Another study of a closure of beds in a single hospital because of a nursing shortage found a reduction in the proportion of patients admitted primarily for monitoring, with no demonstrated changes in mortality for either patients admitted to the ICU or for those cared for elsewhere in the hospital.48 These few studies suggest that there may be room at the top of the curve to decrease ICU beds and decrease costs without substantial harm in some settings.",

One option that combines local needs with a more population-based approach to care may be regionalization of care so that ICU beds and specific technology, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or high-frequency ventilation, are concentrated within regions.52, 53 Such a system makes sense from the perspective of queuing theory, which shows that the likelihood of a delay in admission occurring goes down as the total number of beds in the system increases.54 Therefore, treating ICUs not as silos but as part of a larger system of beds may decrease the lack of available beds. The creation of critical care networks and the more frequent transfer of patients between hospitals is one way in which the United Kingdom may optimize its use of fewer beds.55, 56\n",

Moreover, like the recognition that there is a family of Starling curves, there are many factors that might shift the optimal spot on the curve or the entire curve itself, such as the health of the underlying population.57 For example, data comparing the United States and United Kingdom demonstrate that middle-aged Americans have approximately twice the burden of chronic illness compared with a similar population in the United Kingdom.58 Given the association between chronic illnesses and critical illness, the overall ICU needs of a sicker population will likely be higher. Different availability of services on general wards and stepdown beds will also affect this calculation. The increasing use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation, which often can be delivered to patients outside an ICU, may create a substantial downward shift in the demand for traditional ICU beds that can accommodate patients receiving mechanical ventilation.59\n",

As mentioned earlier, queuing theory provides information regarding the required ICU needs at a local level because it accounts for the problem of fixed capacity with random demand. Although operating at 90% to 100% occupancy may appear to be most efficient in terms of use of ICU beds, this level of occupancy is likely to result in delayed or denied admission and decreased efficiency for the health-care system as a whole.54, 60 Moreover, systems that are operating on the edge of overload are ill equipped to deal with any surge in demand, such as that seen in an epidemic. This situation occurred in Toronto, Canada, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, with too few additional beds available when some ICU beds needed to be closed to contain the disease.61\n",

Delivery of high-intensity treatment is clearly life saving in many circumstances. Moreover, no clinician ever wants to be in the position of being unable to provide the appropriate bed and resources for a patient in need. But overprovision of ICU beds, like an overfilled heart, may ultimately generate harm that is less easily quantified but important to recognize. We often speak of number needed to treat but rarely emphasize the number needed to harm. As the volume of patients in the ICU goes up and the severity of illness goes down, the calculation that health-care providers do daily in their heads to assess the need for ICU admission becomes even more complex and should at least include a possible coefficient for harm. Our understanding of health-care systems, and critical care in particular, is not yet sophisticated enough to place real numbers on these curves or even to be sure which Starling curve is right. We must continue, however, to question our needs and seek to understand the individual and societal impact of the provision of intensive care.",
