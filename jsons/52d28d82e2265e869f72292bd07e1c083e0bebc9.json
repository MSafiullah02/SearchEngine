Under current clinical paradigms, both human and animal health professionals routinely diagnose and treat zoonotic infectious diseases in their patients, but tend to work in parallel with little cross-professional communication or coordination of care. For this to evolve toward a One Health model, both types of clinicians need to see how individual cases can be ''sentinel events'' indicating environmental risk for disease emergence, and develop mechanisms of rapid communication about these risks. Human and animal clinicians also need to take a more proactive and preventive approach to zoonotic diseases that includes the occupational health of animal workers in farms, laboratories, veterinary clinics, and other settings, as well as the recognition of increased risk among immunocompromised individuals in contact with animals. This requires training in One Health clinical competencies including the ability to diagnose and treat zoonotic diseases, implement preventive care interventions for individual patients, provide occupational health services for animal workers, recognize sentinel cases, report cases to public heath and clinical colleagues, and assess and help to intervene with environmental factors driving infectious disease risk in humans and animals. To provide an evidence base for such competency training, there is a need for development and testing of innovative protocols for One Health clinical collaborations.",

            "text": "One Health is a concept that involves cooperation between professionals in human, animal, and environmental health. Such professionals may work in a number of sectors, including public health services, agriculture, environmental quality, and veterinary and human medicine. To date, much of the discussion and development of the One Health concept with respect to emerging infectious diseases has revolved around the role of public health and disease control agencies. Despite endorsements from professional societies, including the American Medical Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, there has been far less articulation of the specific One Health clinical activities for veterinary and human health care providers. Current medical school curricula devote relatively little time to zoonotic diseases, and medical school courses in One Health are virtually nonexistent. In summary, One Health developments have proceeded without much involvement of the clinical professional community. In this chapter, we assert that human and animal health clinicians have a critical role to play in One Health efforts regarding emerging infectious diseases, and indeed unless clinicians begin to define a clear strategy for incorporating One Health principles into clinical practice, the development of One Health as a viable disease control paradigm will be severely hampered. This chapter will illustrate how human and animal health clinicians currently providing services to individual humans and animals are already engaged with emerging zoonotic diseases. We point out how clinician training and development of enhanced clinical protocols could allow for the application of One Health principles to such care, and how this could result in improved disease control. We also describe the important role of clinicians in the preventive care of populations, including animal herds and animal workers, and how the provision of occupational health services for animal workers provides an ideal nexus for One Health collaboration between human and animal clinicians in order to prevent and detect zoonotic disease transmission at the human-animal interface. Finally, we review the significant barriers to the creation of a cadre of One Health clinicians in both human medical and veterinary training centers, and outline strategies for overcoming such obstacles to achieve this vital goal. In their daily clinical practices, human health clinicians may diagnose and treat patients with zoonotic infectious diseases. These diseases may appear as acute disease processes, such as salmonellosis in a child with reptile contact, or they could manifest in more chronic fashion, such as a brucellosis infection in a hunter. Sometimes zoonotic diseases spring from asymptomatic reservoirs, such as deermice (Peromyscus spp) that appear not to develop clinical illness from Hantavirus infection or the Borrelia spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Yet many zoonotic pathogens cause disease in both humans and animals, and veterinarians and physicians may find themselves treating similar disease complexes in their respective patients, even using similar antibiotic regimens. Examples of this cross-species virulence include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a severe and often fatal disease in both dogs and humans caused by tickborne Rickettsia, and avian influenza, which has devastated poultry flocks in several continents as well as causing hundreds of human deaths.",

As mentioned above, this approach of treating the human disease in isolation of animal and environmental health aspects may stem from a perception that animals harboring infectious pathogens are often asymptomatic and not in need of clinical care. Indeed, a common medical recommendation is to remove an animal from a household, as when an obstetrician inappropriately advises that a pregnant woman avoid all cat contact to prevent toxoplasmosis (Kravetz and Federman 2005) .",

Kittens with flea infestations are epidemiologically linked with Bartonella infection in people (Klotz et al. 2011) . Again, as with the human health clinicians, there is a tendency to treat the animal and not directly deal with issues of possible infection occurrence in nearby humans. However, veterinarians are trained to counsel their clients about zoonotic risks, and may recommend that the client seek medical care if symptoms should develop. At the same time, it is rare for veterinarians to directly contact their medical colleagues in the community, even if they are treating members of the same household.",

There have been well documented instances of animals serving as ''sentinels'' for human disease risk. The classic example is the ''canary in the coal mine'' where coal miners brought canaries into mine shafts because they had proved to be more susceptible than the miners to the effects of hypoxia and carbon monoxide exposure, and would literally fall off of their perch when sickened by the fumes, allowing the miners time to don protective equipment (Rabinowitz and Conti 2009).",

            "text": "Another well publicized example of animal sentinel disease events was the 1999 emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States. WNV caused an acute and fatal encephalitis in crows and other birds in Bronx NY at the same time that humans in the area were reporting an increase in encephalitis cases. The unusual pathology pattern in the affected birds was what alerted an astute veterinary clinician to the fact that this was a novel virus infection event. Eventually, the human cases were also found to be due to WNV (Kahn 2006) . It would have been ideal, in these cases, for both human health and veterinary clinicians to have recognized the cross-species relevance of the cases and taken steps to notify both public health as well as each other directly. They also, ideally, would have used such case information to consider whether there were environmental changes driving the emergence of the cases and ''shared risk'' of infection across different species that warranted further investigation. In terms of RMSF, for example, the patterns of abundance of the tick vector are unevenly distributed across the landscape (CDC 2012a) and an increase in detected cases and/or case severity could signify a change in the disease ecology (Adjemian et al. 2009 ). Using sentinel cases to focus investigations for environmental and ecological disruption and drivers of emergence is therefore a key aspect of One Health in clinical practice.",

Such an instance represents a sentinel event with clinical importance both for the larger population of animal workers as well as the hogs to which the workers are exposed.

For example, ocular larval migrans from dog or cat roundworm infections are a preventable cause of childhood blindness. For this reason, puppies and kittens should be dewormed starting at 2 weeks of age, then every 2 weeks until they can receive an age-appropriate monthly intestinal deworming medication (Companion Animal Parasite Council 2012). Veterinarians can also guide appropriate pet selection to mitigate hazards to owners. Should an animal become infected with a zoonotic pathogen, timely diagnosis and treatment and proper husbandry will serve to reduce transmission to people. In these ways, veterinarians have a significant role in the public health controls of zoonoses.",

Specific recommendations for all patients include hand-washing after handling pets and pet dishes, and avoiding contact with animal feces and vomitus through proper disposal. Pregnant women should avoid handling cat feces and litter, keep cats indoors, and not feed cats uncooked meat to reduce the risk of toxoplasmosis. Additionally, people at increased risk of zoonotic infection should not feed pets raw meat diets to prevent enteric pathogens. \u2022 Keeping exotic pets carries increased risk of exotic pathogens, an example being an outbreak of monkeypox in the Midwest United States traced to imported African rodents (Reed et al. 2004 ).

At present, many if not most of these individuals receive little to no preventive health services related to their work exposures including exposure to zoonotic pathogens. At the same time, zoonotic pathogens often first emerge at the animal-worker interface, and the occupational setting represents an ideal and underutilized setting for early detection and prevention of cross-species disease transmission. For example, the worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first noted in a chef in Hong Kong who was preparing wild animal meat for consumption. Subsequent serological surveys of live animal market workers in China showed evidence of transmission between wild animals and these workers. The emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia took place in the setting of large-scale swine production in the vicinity of rain forest that was home to the wildlife reservoir of the pathogen (flying foxes-Pteropus sp.) and the first human cases were swine workers exposed to diseased pigs (Chua 2010) . One of the first recorded fatalities to highly pathogenic avian influenza was a veterinarian responding to the poultry outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza in the Netherlands, and highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has caused numerous deaths in humans working with poultry in either the commercial or backyard setting (WHO 2012). While the exact circumstances of the reassortment event leading to the worldwide pandemic of 2009 H1N1 novel influenza A infection remain unknown, it is likely that the reassortment took place in swine and then crossed to human populations through a swine worker with close contact with infected animals. Since that original event, there have been documented cases of reverse zoonotic transmission of H1N1 from infected swine workers to pigs, and this may have contributed to the recent emergence of a recombinant H3N2 strain (CDCb). The growing industrialization of agricultural animal production demands a more organized approach to infectious disease risks in concentrated animal settings, and this must include both worker health and reduction of pathogen pollution from animal waste. Occupational Health is a discipline that focuses on the recognition and prevention of hazardous exposures in the workplace setting. It applies a preventive medicine paradigm with a ''hierarchy of controls'' based on elimination of the hazard at the source and the use of engineering and other controls to reduce exposure in the environment. It also involves ongoing surveillance of workers to detect ''sentinel cases'' of occupational disease, in this case zoonotic disease transmission events between animals and animal workers, in settings ranging from bushmeat hunting to industrialized animal production. Occupational Health for animal workers therefore must involve human, animal, and environmental health in a One Health framework in order to prevent zoonotic disease transmission. It can build off proven models of risk reduction in health care workers for infectious hazards including tuberculosis and bloodborne pathogens.",

There are not established guidelines or protocols for such inter-professional communication and perceived barriers toward issues of information sharing and medical record documentation.
