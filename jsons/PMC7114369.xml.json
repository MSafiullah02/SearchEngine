            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a small, enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus, belonging to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales that also includes Coronaviridae and Roniviridae (Cavanagh, 1997, Cowley et al., 2000, Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003, Smits et al., 2003). Other members of the Arteriviridae family include lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Cavanagh, 1997). The PRRSV genome is approximately 15 kb in size and organized to code for two large non-structural polyproteins 1a and 1a/1b in the 5-terminal 12 kb region and 7 structural proteins in the 3-terminal 3 kb region; GP2 (glycoprotein 2), E (small envelope), GP3, GP4, GP5, M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins in order from the 5\u2032 end (Meulenberg et al., 1993, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Wootton et al., 2000). Based on the antigenic and genetic differences, PRRSV isolates are divided into two distinct genotypes: North American genotype and European genotype.",

GP5 and M proteins form a disulfide-linked heterodimer (Mardassi et al., 1996), which has been shown to be essential for infectivity in LDV and EAV (Faaberg et al., 1995, Snijder et al., 2003). GP2, GP3, and GP4 are minor glycoproteins and form a disulfide-linked heterotrimer, and the heterotrimerization has also been shown to be essential for infectivity in EAV (Wieringa et al., 2003a, Wieringa et al., 2003b). For PRRSV, co-expression of GP2/E, GP3, and GP4 resulted in transport of these proteins from the ER through the Golgi complex followed by their release into the culture medium, suggesting a critical role of the heteromultimeric complex for virus maturation (Wissink et al., 2005).",

The E protein is non-glycosylated and intracellular membrane-associated (Snijder et al., 1999, Wu et al., 2001), and for EAV and PRRSV, has been shown to be essential for virus replication. The E protein is highly hydrophobic but contains a cluster of basic amino acids in the hydrophilic C-terminal region. Although the E protein of North American genotype PRRSV contains two cysteine residues at positions 49 and 54, a study has shown that E is unable to form a disulfide-linked homodimers. Nevertheless, E protein of PRRSV exists as a multimer which is probably mediated by ionic interaction (Lee and Yoo, 2005). In contrast, E protein of EAV does not contain cysteine residues and seems to exist as a monomer. A recent study has shown that the PRRSV E protein is likely an ion-channel protein embedded in the viral envelope and may facilitate the uncoating of virus and release of the genome into the cytoplasm (Lee and Yoo, 2006). The E protein has also been predicted to contain a putative N-terminal N-myristoylation site (Snijder et al., 1999, Wu et al., 2001). However, this aspect has not experimentally been demonstrated, and in the present study, we explored the E protein myristoylation using the reverse genetics approach.",

            "text": "The N-terminal myristoylation refers to the linkage of myristic acid (C14:0) via an amide bond to the N-terminal glycine residue of a protein in some cellular, viral, and also a few bacterial proteins (Wilcox et al., 1987, James and Olson, 1990, Boutin, 1997, Nimchuk et al., 2000). The reaction is catalyzed by myristoyl-CoA:N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) (Wilcox et al., 1987). In general, N-myristoylation is an irreversible protein modification that occurs co-translationally following removal of the initiator methionine by a cellular methionylaminopeptidase (Towler et al., 1987, Wolven et al., 1997). N-myristoylation may also occur post-translationally as for the case of pro-apoptotic protein BID where proteolytic cleavage by caspase 8 reveals a hidden myristoylation motif (Zha et al., 2000). Myristoylation has been identified for several viral proteins including VP4 of poliovirus (Chow et al., 1987), Gag protein of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (Henderson et al., 1988), Nef protein of HIV (Harris et al., 1992), pre-S1 of hepatitis B virus (Persing et al., 1987), VP2 of SV40 (Streuli and Griffin, 1987) to name a few, and all of these proteins contain the conserved sequence motif of 1MGxxxS/T, where \u2018x\u2019 is any amino acid (Fig. 1\n). Interestingly, E proteins of all PRRSV isolates have been found to contain the conserved myristoylation sequence motif and this motif is also found in E proteins of EAV, LDV and SHFV (Fig. 1), suggesting the importance of E protein myristoylation.",

            "text": "To examine the possibility of E protein myristoylation, we first determined the effects of a myristoylation inhibitor on PRRSV replication. 2-Hydroxymyristic acid (2-hydroxymyristate, HMA; Sigma\u2013Aldrich) is a chemical known to specifically prevent myristoylation without interfering palmitoylation of an acylated protein (Galbiati et al., 1996). HMA is metabolically activated in cells to CoA-thioester, which then competitively inhibits NMT activity. At 0.1 mM concentration, HMA has been shown to reduce the growth of a variety of viruses including herpes simplex virus and arenavirus for up to three orders of magnitude (Harper et al., 1993, Perez et al., 2004). Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were grown in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT), and titrated for cytotoxicity at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM of HMA. 1.0 mM or higher concentration of HMA was found to be toxic for PAM cells, and thus 0.1 mM was chosen for subsequent studies. PAMs were infected with 5\u201310 MOI (multiplicity of infection) with a North American type PRRSV (strain P129). Four hours post-infection, the culture supernatant was replaced with a fresh medium containing 0.1 mM of HMA and the cells were further incubated for an additional 20 h. Cell culture supernatant was collected for virus titration, and viral RNA was also extracted from the supernatant for real-time RT-PCR. In the presence of HMA, titers of PRRSV were reduced by 2.5 log TCID50 and the reduction was statistically significant (P\n < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). To confirm the reduction of infectivity in the supernatant, real-time RT-PCR was conducted using RNA extracted from the culture supernatant. The level of viral RNA also decreased significantly when compared with that of the untreated cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that PRRSV is myristoylated, and since E is the only protein containing the myristoylation motif among PRRSV proteins (data not shown), the E protein is likely the myristoylated protein in PRRSV.",

PCR products were used to transform Escherichia coli and appropriate clones were screened based on the SmaI digestion pattern of the plasmid followed by sequencing for verification of the mutation. Five clones were independently obtained from two different mutagenesis experiments.

Both specific targeting and membrane affinity are achieved through harmonized effects of these factors, for example, dual acylation of a protein by myristoylation and palmitoylation often directs the protein to lipid rafts (Zacharias et al., 2002). In viruses, the myristoyl moiety not only targets to membranes or specific lipids (Hearps and Jans, 2007, Saad et al., 2006), but can also be involved in direct interactions with other proteins (Hayashi et al., 2002) or in the conformational switches that affect tertiary and quaternary structures of a protein (Liemann et al., 2002).

The PRRSV E protein also contains similar functional properties to those of SARS coronavirus E protein but differs in their structures (Lee and Yoo, 2006). For ion-channel proteins, multimerization is a common property. The PRRSV E protein contains two well-conserved cysteine residues for the North American genotype but these residues are not conserved in LDV, EAV, and SHFV, including the European genotype PRRSV. Additionally, the PRRSV E protein has been shown not to form a disulfide-linked homodimer and therefore does not undergo cysteine-linked multimerization for pore formation (Lee and Yoo, 2006). Consequently, the cysteine residues in E have been shown to be non-essential for PRRSV infectivity (Lee and Yoo, 2005). However, by cross-linking studies, the PRRSV E protein has been shown to exist as non-covalently linked homo-multimers in virus-infected cell, suggesting that the physical basis for pore formation of E to function as an ion-channel is likely a non-covalent, ionic interaction between monomeric E proteins. The PRRSV E protein is highly hydrophobic and contains a cluster of basic, positively charged amino acids in the hydrophilic C-terminal region. Thus, it is predicted that the major role of myristoylation for PRRSV E is to enhance its membrane association and protein interactions. This will facilitate the stable pore formation of E on the viral membrane and permit stable ion influx and subsequent pH alterations in the virion interior, which in turn will lead to efficient uncoating processes of the viral capsid. This premise is supported by the findings in the present study that the myristoylation knock-out mutant virus was viable but its replication was severely affected. Coronavirus E proteins resemble PRRSV E proteins in many aspects as an ion-channel protein (Wilson et al., 2004, Wilson et al., 2006). Coronavirus E proteins, however, do not contain the myristoylation motif. Similarly, toroviruses and roniviruses, other member viruses in the Nidovirales order, do not appear to contain the myristoylation motif in their homologs. Thus, it is conceivable that the E protein myristoylation is a common and unique feature to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales.",
