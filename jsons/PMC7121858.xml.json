In the lungs, the loss of function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator decreases the hydration of the airways through multiple mechanisms including creation of a hyper-absorptive state [1]. Without proper mucus hydration there is less mucociliary clearance of bacteria, leading to gross retention of pathogens [1]. Pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Achromobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Mycobacteria often become colonized in the lower airways. This leads to chronic inflammation and irreversible tissue damage of the airways. Severe bronchiectasis is the end result, sheltering niduses of pathogen-laden mucus, which become increasingly difficult to clear. At times, acute exacerbations of these chronic infections can occur, leading to the temporary worsening of already compromised lung function.",

All include some combination of the following symptoms: an increase in sputum volume or color, new or increased hemoptysis, increased cough, increased dyspnea, malaise, fatigue, temperature > 38C, anorexia/weight loss, sinus pain, change in sinus discharge, change in physical examination of the chest, decrease in pulmonary function by \u226510%, or radiographic changes in support of a pulmonary infection [1, 60, 61].

However, antibiotic choice should be individualized, and other options for therapy\ninclude trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, minocycline, clindamycin, levofloxacin, teicoplanin, and rifampin [62]. It should be noted that vancomycin does not penetrate biofilm, and vancomycin resistance also confers teicoplanin resistance [73]. Doxycycline should not typically be used in patients less than 8 years old. Linezolid has several potential side effects including serotonin syndrome, irreversible neuropathy, and severe lactic acidosis. Resistance to linezolid is increasing as it is used more frequently [73]. At our center, we often cover for MRSA\nwith clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or vancomycin, depending on the patient\u2019s history.",

Twenty-eight days of inhaled aztreonam also seems to be an effective eradication strategy for newly acquired PA [84]. Inhaled colistin and oral ciprofloxacin are first-line options in the United Kingdom for initial colonization [83]. Chronic colonization of PA is defined as three positive cultures each a month apart or more [13]. Ongoing inhaled aztreonam and tobramycin are recommended for treatment of these patients, typically administered in a 1-month on, 1-month off pattern [17]. Lastly, there is evidence that ivacaftor has some anti-PA and anti-SA activity due to its quinolone-like structure, explaining another mechanism for the drug\u2019s efficacy beyond the CFTR modulation [85].",
