            "text": "Coronavirus COVID-19 is responsible for the current ongoing worldwide epidemic 1 and it is manifesting a significantly high potential of quick global diffusion. Coronaviruses, including human COVID-19, produce upper and lower respiratory tract infections such as laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), being in such extreme cases responsible of the most of the disease-related fatalities, as we quickly learned in the last weeks, in the subgroups of patients harbouring other pre-existing comorbidities. 2 Since the Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) are opportunistic pathogens, growing evidence is supporting their capability to elide the immune system and affect extrarespiratory organs. [3] [4] [5] Two possible mechanisms for intracranial spread of viral infections have been described. The first mechanism of central nervous system (CNS) invasion is a result of a direct hematogenous attack of the pathogen, using the bloodstream as vehicle, up to the blood-brain-barrier. In the second scenario, the virus attacks the peripheral nerve fibers of the upper respiratory tract, subsequently enters the axons of such nerves and by means of a retrograde ascent, eventually affects the CNS. 6 At present (beginning of March 2020), the case count has risen until up to about 100 000 cases, with a total amount of about 3500 fatalities. 7 The further epidemic potential is considered to be still clarified and is definitely unclear the CoVid-19 potential for CNS involvement. Although it has been recognized as a notably rare condition, 8 CNS involvement was reported by several authors 9-11 as a possible consequence of viral infection as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of immunocompromised patients. Moreover, the HCoV has been associated to the development of a Multiple-Sclerosis (MS), since a T lymphocytic cell cross reaction with HCoV-229E antigens and myelin basic protein has been demonstrated. Moreover, RNA of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E was more frequently identified by means of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) investigations in MS patients rather than in healthy subjects. 12 From our experience in the management of CNS infections, we outline, in this paper, the most probable and concrete clinical landscapes in which the professionality of a neurosurgeon could be required in the attempt to support the decision-making process in the clinical course of a CoVid-19 patient.",

[17] [18] [19] [20] Regarding neuroradiology, a brain computed tomography (CT) scan can outline the presence of a mild or massive brain swelling, along with the presence of midline shift and brain herniations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides the most conclusive clues about the presence of major ongoing inflammatory/infectious intracranial processes. 21 In particular, it discloses the presence of T1-W, T2-W, FLAIR, and DWI regional hyperintense abnormalities possibly suspicious for viral encephalitis (VE). Both CT and MRI scan are effective in disclosing space occupying inflammatory foci, which are mandatory to outline and ponder before performing a LP.",
