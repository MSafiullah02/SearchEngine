Abstract Objective: Chinese pediatricians are working on the front line to fight COVID-19. They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world. Methods: By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed.",

At the beginning of the epidemic, there was insufficient understanding of the significance of anal swab nucleic acid detection. A 10-year-old boy had a history of close contact with the diagnosed patient, but he had no symptoms, and his blood routine and chest CT examination were normal. Nucleic acid samples from respiratory tract specimens were negative many times, but stool samples were positive for nucleic acids after 17 days and then turned negative after 9 days 14 . There are also reports of children who were discharged from the hospital twice after a negative nucleic acid test and then returned to the hospital because of digestive tract symptoms and positive fecal nucleic acid 15 . The author detected 73 cases of adult SARS-CoV-2-infected fecal virus RNA, and the positive rate accounted for 53.4%. After the respiratory viral nucleic acid was negative, 23.3% of the stools were still positive. Viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissue biopsy specimens of infected cases. Immunofluorescence staining of the ACE2 receptor and viral nucleocapsid protein in gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium were positive, which provided evidence for gastrointestinal infection 13 . Nucleic acid positivity in anal swabs mostly occurs after positive respiratory tract specimens, and the negative time is longer than that in respiratory tract specimens, indicating that the digestive tract clears viruses slower than the respiratory tract 12 . Is the novel coronavirus shed from the respiratory tract and swallowed into the digestive tract? It is unclear whether the respiratory and digestive tracts are also infected. The long-term discharge of SARS-CoV-2 in feces may pollute the environment and endanger public health 16 . Is there a risk of fecal-oral transmission? Should the isolation (or discharge) of the patient be terminated before the viral nucleic acid in the feces becomes negative? It is worth exploring.",

It should be combined with clinical manifestations, especially chest CT manifestations, to make a judgment; (8) the child's condition is mild, recovery is fast, the treatment effect and prognosis are good, and one case has died so far. The above characteristics are worth paying attention to: asymptomatic, light cases are more concealed, which makes early identification and early isolation difficult in children with COVID-19, and children should be avoided as a hidden source of transmission power for kindergartens, schools or families. .",
