            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are divided into multiple subtypes according to diversified viral surface antigens and two major pathotypes including high and low pathogenicity for chicken [1], [2]. Among these IAVs, all avian viruses with high pathogenicity belong to the H5/H7 subtype [3], but a novel avian-original influenza virus emerged at the spring of 2013 and unfortunately lead to severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans [4]. This novel virus has a similar phylogenetic genome to a virus isolated from chicken found in a live poultry market [4]. H7N9 virus is one of the many reassortant viruses, which are primarily derived from the H7N3, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes of IAVs [5\u22127]. Although H7N9 is pathogenically low in chickens [8], human beings are much more susceptible to transmission, particularly at live poultry markets after intimate contact with H7N9-infected chickens [4], [9]. H7N9 viruses are able to spread between mammalian hosts (ferrets) without losing virulence [10], and genetic mutations of H7N9 virus confer the risk of human-to-human transmission [11\u221213], as demonstrated in a few family clusters infected by this virus [14], [15]. There have been six seasonal epidemics since the first case emerged in 2013, and the epidemic resurgence of the virus since 2016 in mainland China, suggest that it has become more virulent [16], [17]. Therefore, defending against H7N9 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will be instrumental in curing H7N9 patients.",

There is currently no vaccine available for preventing H7N9 infections. Moreover, other extensive therapeutic interventions (such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)) have been applied to patients with severe H7N9 infectious patients [20\u221222]. However, dealing with the antiviral resistance of H7N9 and secondary infection induced multiple organ dysfunction in patients is still a serious concern, and there is an exigent demand to explore an effective strategy against H7N9 infection in humans. The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) garnered on global attention for causing infectious pneumonia in Wuhan, China [23\u221225]. The number of infected patients rose rapidly due to a lack of enough awareness, proximity of people, ease of mobility, and the human-to-human transmission ability of the virus [26\u221229]. Currently, there is no effective way to cure COVID-19. Because H7N9 and COVID-19 share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction with lung inflammatory lesions and structural damage [24], [30]. Hence, finding a breakthrough of treatment strategy for H7N9 infection in humans will be critical for treating COVID-19 especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is currently causing panic around the world.",

Our MSC laboratory was alerted after informed consent, and doctors observed the hemodynamic and respiratory parameters for 1-hour period of bedside observation to ensure the status of patients was stable prior to MSC transplantation. Then the infusion was initiated using a standard blood filter tubing set. The investigators stayed at the bedside for uninterrupted observation in case any signs of an adverse reaction. 3 patients were treated with three fusions of MSCs at the early stage of H7N9 infection, while the other 6 patients were treated with three fusions of MSCs at the late stage of H7N9 infection, and only 8 patient accepted four-infusion of MSCs at the late stage of H7N9 infection. The injection dose of MSCs is determined to be 1 million per kg body weight for each time. No MSC infusion-related acute toxicities or seriously adverse events were found in any of these patients. A multiple intravenous infusion of MSC was tolerated in these patients with moderate to severe H7N9 induced ARDS.",

However, there are some limitations to this clinical trial. First and foremost, this study had a limited number of patients a single-center study. With only 17 patients using MSC, we cannot guarantee every step is perfect at our phase with only one time of the clinical trial. Secondly, we should express that this is not a routine clinical trial owing to the H7N9 outbreak and no other better choice to treat these patients with severe ARDS. Therefore, they didn\u2019t want to have further visits, and some patients refused to attend, and even some did not complete follow up. Thus we are still concerned the long-term safety of MSC administration for treating H7N9 induced ARDS despite the lack of side effects observed in this clinical trial. Moreover, although some patients may have a potential lung infection in H7N9 patients, most of them are receiving other drugs without further examination, and we can\u2019t obtain the ideal comparison of lung functional indicators between the MSC group and the control group. Finally, the limitations of a small sample size are difficult to obtain the huge clinical data. Therefore, it is hard to conduct clinical studies in critically patients suffering with ARDS.",

Despite there are numerous promising results of MSC administration, long-term safety remains a matter of debate, especially hardly to managing the long-term follow up for all patients [51]. The other concern is that MSC not only has potential to inhibit tumor immune responses, but also can generate new blood vessels, which may promote tumor growth and metastasis [52]. Although MSC has shown great promise in the treatment of some immunological diseases (especially GVHD), the variabilities of MSC quality from different donors and tissues are widely varies, and treatment protocols, doses and injection modes are inconsistent during experimental procedures [53]. All these factors may limit the therapeutic effect of MSC in clinical application. To overcome these obstacles, careful evaluation of appropriate cell sources, more scientific data, and a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of MSCs immunosuppression are needed.",

Although our group has reported some clinical studies in H7N9 infected patients [6], [12], [15], [36], understanding the detailed mechanism is still needed to reveal the potential for treating H7N9 induced ARDS. Along with our previous work [19], [54], [55], MSC has the ability to improve lung function through anti-inflammatory effects in acute injury lung in a mouse model. Thus, the underlying mechanism is probably that MSCs reduce the secretion of inflammatory factors. Although the clinical research of MSCs are still in its infancy, we are optimistic that MSCs (including different sources) will be a promising tool for future clinical application.",
