It can be simplified to mean actions taken to mediate risks (Jaykus et al. 2006). The most important component of risk management is that the decision-making process for risk managers should be transparent and be based directly upon scientific findings of the risk assessment (CAC 1999; Wilde 2013). Undertaking a risk assessment before making a risk management decision is an excellent way of achieving this goal, and hence the assessment itself should be linked to a very clear risk management question. Understandably, risk managers have to balance multiple factors, such as overarching economic capabilities, the available technology, and the current social, political, and legal status of the issue at hand (EPA 2000). While risk management decisions are influenced by myriad factors, risk assessment is intended to be conducted based solely on science and hence independent of outside influences (Wilde 2013).",

As intimated above, risk assessment is only one factor that goes into decision-making to manage risk. The third component of risk analysis, risk communication, is the sharing of risk assessment and management information among stakeholders, the general public, and other interested or affected groups (Jaykus et al. 2006), as well as among risk assessors, managers, and communicators themselves (EPA/USDA-FSIS 2012). The diversity of audience means that risk communication messages and methods must be carefully tailored to different audiences. The process may involve the creation of visual and written materials for distribution, but is more often two-way discussions with stakeholders, where the communicator appears as a credible source (Lundgren and McMakin 2013). Risk communication for human enteric pathogens is typically a planned event performed by trained professionals (FAO/WHO 2006). Aside from providing a clear explanation of the chosen risk management actions, this communication should also explain why the hazard poses a significant health risk, what populations are most at risk, what assumptions were made in the risk assessment process, where uncertainties arose in the assessment or management process, and why some actions were chosen over others (EPA/USDA-FSIS 2012; FAO/WHO 2006).",

However, the exercise as a defined, systematic, and (frequently) quantitative entity emerged in the 1960s and 1970s in relationship to risks associated with aerospace and nuclear disasters, where their use was quite controversial. Since that time the process of risk assessment has been embraced by a number of US federal agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and Energy (NRC 2009; EPA 2000). For example, the US EPA has used the method from the time of its establishment in 1970. In 1983, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published a consensus document entitled: Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process (NAS 1983), which has since been referred to as the \u201cRed Book\u201d. This document established \u201cstandard operating procedures\u201d for risk assessment and associated reporting.",

By the mid-1990s, there was increasing interest in applying probabilistic risk assessment principles to microbiological hazards, both in the environmental and food sectors. While the risk assessment paradigm is the same regardless of the nature of the health risk, the details differ. For example, chemicals remain stable, degrade, or perhaps change composition from the time of their deposition in the environment to human exposure, while microbes can multiply, remain stable, or even grow along the food chain. Cancer health risk modeling, which involves chronic low-level exposures, is very different from modeling the acute exposures associated with most human pathogens. Hence, in the mid-1990s, microbiological risk assessment diverged from chemical risk assessment and became its own discipline. In the last 20 years, many microbiological risk assessments have been undertaken in both environmental and food sectors.",

The principal aim of MRA is to provide an objective, transparent, evidence-based assessment of the health risk of multiple exposure pathways or scenarios. The strength of MRA is illustrated in its ability to support scenario analyses, which facilitates comparison of the efficacy of different combinations of risk management interventions (Jaykus et al. 2006).",

Microbial risk assessments for viruses have some key differences from those classically performed for chemical hazards, with added considerations such as virus decay, varying susceptibility to disinfectants, host immunity and susceptibility, differences in clinical symptoms and health outcomes (including the potential for asymptomatic infections), genetic diversity and the emergence of novel viral strains, and multiple potential routes of exposure (EPA/USDA-FSIS 2012).",

At the international level, risk assessments are usually used in the development and enforcement of food safety standards, particularly those involving trade (FAO/WHO 2008; CAC 1999). For example, all member nations of the World Trade Organization must partake in risk assessments in regards to their food safety and plant and animal health under Article 5 of the current Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (\u201cSPS Agreement\u201d) (WTO 1995).

The prime directive of a risk assessment is that it should be objective, unbiased, and based in sound science (FAO/WHO 2006; NRC 2009). Ideally, in the case of foodborne pathogens, it should also take the entire food production process into account (FAO/WHO 2006), such as growing, harvesting, processing, distributing, and other actions taken before the food reaches the end consumer, also referred to as a \u201cfarm-to-fork continuum.\u201d It is not uncommon, particularly in large-scale assessments, for formal risk assessment teams to be formed. The most effective risk assessment teams are multidisciplinary, combining the expertise of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, researchers, and other specialists (FAO/WHO 2006). While risk assessments are typically portrayed as linear steps, the process should actually be seen as a series of continuous feedback loops, evolving as new information is made available. The term \u201citerative\u201d is frequently used to describe this process (Jaykus et al. 2006).",

An exposure assessment for food or waterborne pathogens is often an evaluation of the likelihood of the actual or anticipated intake of the pathogen in a population or certain subgroups (FAO/WHO 2003). The likelihood of exposure is determined by a chain of events which, for a full risk assessment, usually encompasses all of the steps from production to consumption (CAC 1999). Using enteric viruses in fresh produce as an example (Table 17.1), this might include considering the possibility of contamination in production waters; irrigation practices; transmission of viruses during growing or harvest; washing conditions (if applicable); persistence of the hazard on or in the produce through the food chain; and food storage, preparation, and consumption practices. An exposure assessment benefits from quantitative information about the virus of concern including its concentration in the environment and on/in foods, how often environmental contamination occurs, persistence (or growth) of the virus in the environment or foods, and portion sizes and frequency of food consumption. The end product of the exposure assessment for quantitative risk assessment is a mathematical model expressing the likelihood and magnitude of exposure to the hazard across the farm-to-fork continuum.\n",

The dose\u2013response curve allows for estimation of the probability of specific health impacts (e.g., infection, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, death, chronic disease) based on given exposure levels (EPA/USDA-FSIS 2012). Under ideal circumstances, dose\u2013response data are derived from human populations. Of course, availability of direct human challenge data is scant for diseases that cause severe illness (FAO/WHO 2008). Nonetheless, some human dose\u2013response information is available for enteric viruses such as norovirus (Teunis et al. 2008) and rotavirus (Ward et al. 1986). In the case of hepatitis A virus, the dose\u2013response relationship is usually extrapolated from a human challenge study with echovirus 12 (Thebault et al. 2012; Schiff et al. 1984). Even with such human exposure information, only a few data points are available and hence modeling is quite crude. In the absence of human challenge data, information from epidemiology, animal feeding studies, and even laboratory-based studies on virulence or infectivity in mammalian cell culture can be used. In an ideal world, factors such as strain-to-strain differences in infectivity and population susceptibility are included in dose\u2013response modeling, but frequently data with this level of granularity are not available.\n",

Named for a famous casino in Monaco, Monte Carlo relies on sampling random (or pseudorandom) numbers, generated like the outcomes from a roulette wheel (Zio 2013; Amar 2006), and hence is probabilistic in nature. Basically, each input or variable in the exposure or risk model is estimated as a distribution, rather than a single \u201cpoint.\u201d The appropriate distribution is determined from the data source(s) or else by assumption. Then, for each risk calculation or \u201csimulation,\u201d the input values are chosen randomly from each distribution and a single risk number is produced. This process is repeated multiple times or as multiple \u201citerations\u201d (usually 10,000) (Amar 2006). Each of these is its own miniature risk assessment so to speak, and the results of all the iterations together are graphed as a distribution of probabilities and risk.",

            "text": "Monte Carlo simulation-based models, which rely on expressing input values as distributions, are particularly appealing because they can represent variability and uncertainty. Variability refers to data heterogeneity or variation; it is an inherent propertyof the data and cannot be reduced by further measurement (Suter 2006). The term variability usually applies to a well-characterized dataset. Uncertainty is basically a \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or absence of data (NRC 2009; Zio 2013). While it can be reduced by further study or data collection, many input variables in a risk assessment are simply uncharacterized but still need to be included in the model. However, since their data are often assumed or at best approximated, they can lead to inaccuracy and bias in risk estimates. Remembering that simulated outcomes may not hold true in the real world, it is best to validate mathematical models with known disease incidence data or real-life information (FAO/WHO 2006). Epidemiological data are frequently used to do such validations. However, this can be difficult for viruses as there are no international requirements to report foodborne viral disease outbreaks and the vast majority are unrecognized or uninvestigated (FAO/WHO 2008).",

In sensitivity analysis, one input variable is toggled between its low and high value keeping all the others at median, followed by simulation. This is systematically done for each input such that there is a range of low and high risk associated with each input. Sensitivity analysis identifies which variables provide the largest range of risk estimates, and the model is hence more \u201csensitive\u201d to those inputs. In short, sensitivity analysis determines how changes in the entered parameters affect the results of a model (FAO/WHO 2006; CAC 1999; Zio 2013), which can be used to identify inputs having the greatest impact on the magnitude of differences in risk estimates. This can allow the user to make inferences about real-world events. Frequently, the most sensitive variables are those that also drive the risk, and hence these are good candidates as the focus of mitigation strategies (Barker 2014).",

Sensitivity analysis also enables the user to simulate an array of feasible scenarios and to estimate which single or combined management actions are likely to have the biggest impacts on risk (Zio 2013), or little impact at all.

The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority has documented evidence relevant to the transmission of HAV in shellfish, NoV in fresh fruits and vegetables, and HEV in pork (Bouwknegt et al. 2013), while the New Zealand Food Safety Authority sponsored a risk profile on NoV in raw molluscan shellfish (ESR 2009).",

In food microbiology, predictive modeling refers to the use of mathematical models to quantitatively predict the behavior of microbes in a given environment (P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2014). Its use usually focuses on environmental persistence and resistance/inactivation by physical, chemical, or biological means. There are a number of instances in which predictive modeling has been applied to laboratory data on virus persistence and/or inactivation, for example feline calicivirus (FCV, a human NoV surrogate) and HAV with high hydrostatic pressure (Buckow et al. 2008; Kingsley et al. 2006); depuration kinetics of HAV and murine norovirus (MNV-1; another human NoV surrogate) in shellfish (Polo et al. 2015); heat inactivation of MNV-1, FCV, and HAV in deli meat by heat (Bozkurt et al. 2015); to name a few. These can all be helpful in exposure assessment depending upon the application.",

The authors then used these data to estimate a theoretical reduction in infection risk associated with this treatment. The experimental portion yielded D10 values of 1.0\u20131.3 kGy for rotavirus and 2.3\u20132.4 kGy for poliovirus. The risk model included parameters associated with serving size, initial virus contaminant concentration (ranging from 100 to 103 PFU/g), output from the kinetic inactivation model, and dose\u2013response (Beta-Poisson for rotavirus and an exponential model for poliovirus). Reductions in infection risks varied widely (from negligible to over 104) as a function of risk assessment parameters. By way of example, treatments of 3 kGy with a starting virus population on lettuce of 10 PFU/g reduced the risk of poliovirus infection from consumption of contaminated lettuce from a baseline of >20 infections to 6 infections per 100 individuals. Under similar circumstances, rotavirus risk associated with consumption of contaminated spinach dropped from >30 infections to 5 per 100 persons. This paper provides an example in which laboratory-based work was combined with a relatively simple risk model to produce estimates of risk reduction as a function of a virus inactivation strategy.",

The authors then used these data to estimate a theoretical reduction in infection risk associated with this treatment. Mean D10 values of 4.05 and 4.83 kGy were calculated for MNV-1 and HAV, respectively. The risk model included the same parameters as used in the previous study but adjusted for the product (oysters) and the hazard (Beta-Poisson model used for both). The model predicted that if the product were contaminated at a concentration of 105 infectious units per 12 raw oyster serving size, a 5 kGy treatment would result in a 12\u201316 % reduction in infection for both viruses. At only 102 infectious units per serving, NoV infection risk reduction remained relatively stable (26 %) but a 91 % reduction in HAV infection risk was predicted. This study showed that even at high E-beam doses, the viruses of greatest public health significance could not be eliminated from oysters, and at high E-beam doses, risk reduction was minimal.",

Perhaps the first significant work, in which human challenge studies were used as the basis of dose\u2013response modeling, is that of Haas (1983). This investigator compared three commonly used dose\u2013response models with experimental data for poliovirus (three datasets) and echovirus 12 (one dataset). Specifically, the log-normal, simple exponential, and a Beta-distributed model were evaluated. The former two are deterministic models and the latter a stochastic model. For deterministic models, parameter values are determined at the outset and hence the model does not consider randomness or uncertainty. The output is hence \u201cdetermined.\u201d Stochastic models allow for randomness in one or more inputs and must be analyzed statistically. The outcome is not a single value, but a group of values.",

Atmar et al. (2014) estimated an ID50 for Norwalk virus of 3.3 reverse transcription PCR units, which corresponded to between 1320 and 2800 genome equivalent copies, but the study did not include extensive mathematical modeling. The Teunis et al. (2008) work was the first to analyze human challenge study data to produce dose\u2013response models for the prototype human NoV, the Norwalk virus. These investigators sought to determine the probability of infection in participants based on the hit theory, which considers microbial infection as a result of a chain of conditional events, i.e., (1) ingestion of one or more organisms based on an inoculum having a Poisson distribution; and (2) successful navigation of the organism(s) through all host barriers with maintenance of infectivity. A beta-distributed probability is used to model the latter. Particle aggregation was taken into account mathematically and was fit to the experimental data. Probability of illness given infection was modeled by logit transformation of infection and aggregation distributions followed by production of maximum likelihood estimates. In susceptible individuals, the ID50 was about 1000 and 18 genome copies for aggregated virus and disaggregated virus, respectively. The investigators concluded that that the average probability of infection for a single infectious particle could be as high as 0.5. Probability of illness given infection was also dose-dependent, and ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 for 103 and 108 genome copies, respectively (Fig. 17.1).",

Specifically, they used data from five oyster-associated outbreaks in which the exposed population and attack rates were characterized; the number of oysters consumed was known; and the concentration of NoV determined from oysters associated with the outbreak. They used a Beta binomial distribution to model infectivity that took into account heterogeneity of the host-pathogen relationship and non-uniform distribution of the pathogen in the food. Bayesian modeling was then done to estimate model parameters and predict probabilities. Median ID50 estimates were 1.6\u20137.1 genome copies per oyster. The median probability of infection for secretor-positive individuals (which are susceptible to NoV infection, unlike secretor-negative individuals) exposed to a single virus genome was around 0.29 (95 % CI 0.015\u20130.61) for GI human NoV and 0.4 (0.040\u20130.61) for GII. Illness probability was 0.13 (0.007\u20130.39) and 0.18 (0.017\u20130.42) for GI and GII, respectively. Statistically, there was no difference between infectivity of GI and GII human NoV.

Such heterogeneity is mediated by a number of factors, including secretor status (innate, genetically predetermined immunity) and exposure-driven immunity. The ability of exposure to one human NoV strain to protect against infection with another, but only sometimes, also complicates modeling efforts. There are likely strain-to-strain differences in innate susceptibility and disease outcomes (disease severity) but these are also poorly characterized. In most instances, the inability to consider these factors in dose\u2013response modeling means that current models tend to be more conservative (overestimate infection or disease risk) for normal, healthy individuals.

The variation in viral contamination (as a function of volume of water caught by the plants) was taken from previous studies using rotavirus for lettuce and cucumbers, and through field trials conducted by the authors on water retention for broccoli and cabbage. The timing variable was based on reported data on natural viral decay coefficients. Exposure was tied to consumption of the produce items and a Beta-binomial dose\u2013response model was used based on previous work, which was considered representative of enteric viruses in general.

(2008) and a 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 pppy was designated as the tolerable norovirus disease risk based on loss in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), adapted from WHO wastewater guidelines (WHO 2006). Wastewater quality ranging from 106 to 108 CFU E. coli/100 ml resulted in median NoV infection risk of 1 pppy. A risk close to the tolerable level occurred at 101\u2013102 CFU E. coli/100 ml. The investigators concluded that, if wastewater treatment and post-treatment together resulted in a 5\u20136 log10 reduction in E. coli, consistent with the 6-log10 reduction in rotavirus provided by the WHO (2006), it should be possible to achieve adequate NoV inactivation. This assumed that a hurdle type approach was used, one that relied on moderate inactivation during wastewater treatment and a high degree of inactivation during post-treatment, e.g., natural die-off and produce washing and/or disinfection.",

They examined two primary factors: the quantity of human enteroviruses in irrigation water and the loss of viable virus particles on lettuce over time (up to 14 days post irrigation). They integrated data from the literature concerning enterovirus concentrations in secondary-treated effluent; the rate of decay of enteric viruses on the crop and during storage; the amount of water (and hence virus) that attaches to the surface of lettuce; lettuce consumption rates; and dose\u2013response information, extrapolated from known data on rotaviruses. The levels of enterovirus in effluent were derived directly from treatment plant data. A bacteriophage provided the estimate for viral decay post-irrigation. Although initially the investigators reported risks higher than the EPA standard of 1 case per 10,000 people per year consuming finished (treated) water (EPA 1989), in a later erratum, they noted a miscalculation in the bacteriophage inactivation parameters, making the actual rate of decay more rapid. This would mean that estimates of infection would have been reduced and actually fallen below the EPA benchmark of 1 in 10,000 cases, highlighting the importance of virus decay rates in calculating risk.",

These data were then used to estimate exposure risk by mathematical modeling that included variables related to methodology (i.e., adjustments for recovery efficiency and infectivity); virus concentration reductions due to cooking; prevalence of contamination; and consumption. Choice of the best-fit dose response model was done using a combination of the microbiological data, outbreak attack rates, and previously reported enteric virus models associated with human challenge studies. When a Beta-Poisson model was applied to echovirus 12 data, the researchers were able to estimate infection risks corresponding to consumption of lightly cooked clams on a per-batch basis, which matched the corresponding epidemiological data. A correlation between the prevalence of HAV cases and positive virus detection (44 % of samples positive) in clams associated with outbreaks was demonstrated, as juxtaposed to the absence of virus detection in clams randomly tested from the same batches as the outbreak-associated clams.

The mitigation strategies were further subdivided based on parameters such as sensitivity of detection, confirmation of results, frequency of sampling, number of negative results before reopening for harvesting, and time to action. Direct HAV monitoring resulted in greater risk reduction than did the use of conventional bacterial indicators. In both contamination scenarios, twice monthly virus testing was an effective risk management strategy, avoiding about 40\u201350 % of the baseline cases. When contamination was accidental and homogeneous, waiting for three negative test results to reopen an area for harvesting was not effective in risk reduction. However, when contamination was endemic, waiting for the three negative test results was effective in preventing human cases. Any control measures that could reduce contamination by at least 2 log10 units (e.g., improving sanitation, harvesting from lower risk areas) resulted in the greatest risk reduction (87\u201388 %).

RTE foods have also been associated with a number of high-profile outbreaks (Friedman et al. 2005; Malek et al. 2009; Becker et al. 2000). An infected individual practicing poor personal hygiene and especially, engaging in bare hand contact while preparing food, is the most likely cause of this phenomenon. However, such individuals can also contaminate utensils, preparation surfaces, restroom surfaces, and play areas, etc. Since human NoV is released and likely aerosolized during projectile vomiting, this can also serve as a source of virus to contaminate foods (de Wit et al. 2007; Patterson et al. 1997).",

Using the restroom environment as a reservoir, the dynamics of NoV transmission were modeled between employees\u2019 hands, food contact surfaces, and food products. Key model inputs included degree of fecal shedding, hand hygiene behaviors, efficacy of virus removal and/or inactivation, and transferability of virus between surfaces.

Not unexpectedly, the simulations showed the highest virus levels to be on hands, followed by surfaces and gloves, implicating hands as the most important mode of transmission. Gloving and handwashing compliance were found to be the most important practices for preventing contamination of foods when an infected worker was present on-site. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the mass of feces on hands, the concentration of NoV in the stool of ill individuals, the number of bathroom visits by the employee, the level of compliance with glove use, and handwashing efficiency and compliance were the inputs having the greatest impact on risk. A novel aspect of this study was consideration of the joint effects of handwashing compliance and gloving compliance, or handwashing compliance and efficacy. Using what-if scenario analysis, the authors demonstrated that combinations of compliance, gloving, and efficacy are critical to keeping contamination levels at <10 infectious particles per serving. In short, one intervention alone would not result in elimination of significant NoV contamination in the food if an infected food handler were present on the premises. Hence, control measures should take a multi-pronged approach.",

Many of the variables were also similar to those of Mokhtari and Jaykus (2009) and their values came from the published literature. The group also performed a two-week observational study at two deli establishments to estimate number of contact events between hands, foods and surfaces during food preparation.

In a worst-case scenario in which two contamination sources (infected food handler and contaminated lettuce) were present and no intervention was used, most (96 %) of the sandwiches contained the pre-determined ID50 of >18 virus particles. Of the individual intervention measures considered, hand-washing following restroom use was the only one that had a substantial impact on transmission of virus to hands, surfaces, and foods, and the degree of impact very much depended on compliance. For example, at low and intermediate degrees of compliance with handwashing, the fraction of deli sandwiches containing >18 virus particles was 91 and 65 %, respectively. If high handwashing compliance was followed, no sandwiches exceeded the ID50. Of course, using all four measures effectively reduced NoV concentrations on sandwiches to negligible levels (<7 virus particles).",

The most compelling consensusconclusion comes from several models applied to virus infection or disease risks associated with the use of reclaimed water for irrigation of food crops (Hamilton et al. 2006; Mara et al. 2007; Mara and Sleigh 2010; Petterson et al. 2001, 2002; Barker 2014). Virtually all studies confirmed that there was minimal risk to human health from these practices, particularly when treated to achieve 4-log10 or more reduction in enteric viruses (EPA 1989). In the only production/processing risk assessment of its kind, Bouwknegt et al. (2015) demonstrated that HAV and NoV risks associated with the consumption of berries and lettuce were minimal, and when elevated, hand contact was a much more significant source of virus contamination than was irrigation water or the produce washing process. Models applied to molluscan shellfish (Thebault et al. 2012; Pint\u00f3 et al. 2009) focused on addressing questions associated with direct testing for virus contamination for harvest water classification and managing disease risk. Both studies concluded that such testing would be appropriate under certain circumstances, particularly when contamination was continuous.",

A small body of risk assessment work on foodborne viruses has, however, emerged in the last decade. Initially constrained by a paucity of data to support values and distributions for key inputs, studies on prevalence, persistence/resistance, transferability, and other environmental features of these viruses have been recently published. New human challenge studies using GII.2 and GII.4 strains have been completed (although not yet reported), which should improve hazard characterization. Standardized test methods, improved ability to discriminate virus infectivity status using molecular methods, and better surrogates are moving the field along as well. As national and international regulations begin to be promulgated, there will be an increasing incentive to perform QMRA as applied to viruses in foods.",

In addition, we now know that susceptibility to human NoV strains is, in part, genetically mediated but only a few dose\u2013response models consider this fact. Hepatitis A and rotavirus vaccines are now widely used and likely provide life-long immunity, reducing the size of the susceptible population. Again, this is not usually considered in hazard characterization. Estimates of infectivity can be created, but until a cultivable human NoV strain is found, they will remain estimates. There are many different foods, human populations, and production/processing/preparation techniques, meaning that a \u201cone size fits all\u201d model is not really feasible. Consequently, risk assessments will be diverse and will continue to be subject to inclusion of poorly characterized or incomplete data, and assumptions.
