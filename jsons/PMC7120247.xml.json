            "text": "As Cook and Norcup (2011)\nillustrate, the concept of sociability comes from the Russian social anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his book Mutual Aid, published in 1902 . Peter Kropotkin was a fascinating figure, being born into the Russian aristocracy as a prince giving up the privileges of his noble birth due to his growing awareness of the poverty that was endemic to Russian society in the nineteenth century (Cook 1990) . He joined a Cossack regiment rather than an elite one and spent time with them stationed in Siberia. Whilst there, he observed the poor levels of governance of the exile communities as well as anarchist ideas from the exiled poet Mikhailov. Despite grinding poverty and deprivation, he was impressed by the spirit of the exiles and the way in which they came together to survive and in some cases, prosper. He also observed this community spirit in animal species in this vast region. Many years later, by which time he was himself in exile from the Russian authorities and had become the \u2018leading\u2019 anarchist of his day, he drew together his observations of different societies, partly to counter the growing tendency towards Social Darwinism that was leading many thinkers at the time towards the doctrine of survival of the fittest and the eventual horrors of fascism .",

Such networks and relationships become an important community resource as social capital, for example in the process of population migration which can have an important impact on patterns of aging around the globe, either because of the loss of young people to other countries, or the more recent phenomenon of migration of older people themselves, either to their original home country or to warmer climes (see Cook and Halsall 2011 for a fuller discussion).",

In the social policy field, social capital is seen as having the potential to reduce expenditure on social problems, encourage cooperation and trust and enhance quality of life. It assists in explaining why communities with similar resources may diverge in terms of social cohesion, initiative, mutual support, and adaptability to change. Although causal links are difficult to confirm, social capital in the form of social and civic engagement and cooperation appears to bestow advantages of wellbeing and resilience on communities, as well as on individuals. Some go so far as to say that \u2018social capital is the most fundamental resource a community requires in the creation of economic, social and political wellbeing\u2019 (Winter 2000, p. 9 cited in Rowland 2009, p. 63).",

This has been witnessed in several of the chosen case studies except in India, for example, where public spending has not been cut drastically. However, within our sample cases, circumstances involving either welfare budget cuts or improving citizen participation have necessitated a bigger role by the social networks in the co-production of the services. The concept of social capital, sometimes considered an ambiguous concept, has been drawing attention of political scientists; policy makers and commentators help explain the role and importance of social networks and community groups in improving the public service provision. Robert Putnam (2000) in his classic work, \u2018Bowling Alone\u2019 identified how the American society has increasingly become disconnected from one another and the various social structures such as church, political parties have disintegrated signifying a significant social change and a decline of generalised reciprocity (Putnam 2000, p. 505). Field (2003 p. 1) argues that social capital can be summed up in two words: \u2018relationships matter.\u2019 Skidmore et al. (2006, p. 8) have noted that there are strong connections \u2018between the properties of social capital and effectiveness of governance.\u2019 Hence the promotion and practice of social capital means better governance (Putnam 1993).",

Furthermore, it has become common practise for governments to examine what went wrong and how problems can be solved. In this sense, a government tends to examine a community when that community is doing well (Campbell and Jovchelovitch 2000).

Globally, it was estimated that in 2010, 35.6 million people suffer from this disease, rising to 65.7 million by 2030 (Rogers 2013, p. 260). The cost of this to society was estimated at US$ 604 billion in 2010, with the \u2018baby-boomers\u2019 of the late 1940s/early 1950s being at particular risk. Threats such as this worry decision-makers across the planet, particularly given that, currently, the cause of this disease is unknown (Rogers 2013). However, there does seem to be remedial action that can be taken in terms of such factors as exercise, lifestyle, or \u2018resistance training\u2019 (Rogers 2013, p. 261) that can ameliorate or reduce some of the worst consequences of this dreadful disease. One aspect of our study of community action in different countries will be to discover to what extent community involvement can reduce the risk factors and improve the quality of life for dementia sufferers.",

            "text": "It is useful to briefly summarise some demographic and economic features of our sample countries to facilitate comparisons. Table 1.3 accordingly presents key recent data for the sample. In terms of gross national income per head, therefore, the USA is the wealthiest country in the sample with a gross national income per capita (GNIpc) of US$ 50,120 in 2012, closely followed by the Netherlands at US$ 48,250 and Japan with US$ 47,870 and then the UK at US$ 38,250. There is then a marked jump to South Africa, and then the other three countries, with Bangladesh by far the poorest at US$ 840 GNIpc in 2012. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong correlation between GNIpc and the number of population per physician, and to a lesser extent with the population per hospital bed, but South Africa is a strange anomaly with a very low number of people per physician and per hospital bed, far lower than what would be expected in terms of national income. Perhaps this reflects the impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis that has had such a devastating impact on the country. In terms of population, China and India are of course by far the most populous countries, but China does better in terms of a number of criteria, including population per physician and per hospital bed plus life expectancy (72.4 for men in China in 2009 compared to 63.9 for Indian men in 2011 and 76.6 for women in China in 2009 contrasting with 67.1 for Indian women in 2011). This confirms the analysis of Dummer and Cook (2008) who found that China\u2019s health record was better than India\u2019s on a number of counts. India still has a high rate of infectious and parasitic diseases, for example, whereas China is now more likely to suffer from diseases associated with developed countries, such as cancers or heart diseases for instance. Japan is the longest-lived country in terms of life expectancy, at 79.9 for men and 86.4 for women, both for 2012, but it is South Africa rather than India or Bangladesh that comes out lowest on this data with 54.9 years for men and 59.1 years for women, both in 2011. Further, as Cook and Halsall (2011) have shown, there is a marked discrepancy between rates by ethnicity with Whites outliving Blacks in South Africa by a significant margin. These are the sorts of contrasts that will be discussed further in the country chapters below.",
