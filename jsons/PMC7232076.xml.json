It spreads through the respiratory tract leading to fever, cough, and subsequently in those susceptible to have serious outcomes, it may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [6]. The pathogenesis of severe disease is considered to be due to the cytokine storm or a dysregulation of the immune response, in addition to the cytopathic effects of the virus. Both are localized mainly to the lungs due to the presence of high concentrations of virus binding receptors in pneumocytes [7].",

The rapid activation of CD4 \n+\n T cells leads to proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells which secrete proinflammatory cytokines [9]. The response consists of high concentrations of IL1B, IFN\u03b3, IP10, and MCP1 [10]. Severely ill patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission had higher concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 than did those not requiring ICU admission. Other studies report the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, interferon gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF activates monocytes to release more IL-6 leading to the formation of a cytokine storm, which triggers ARDS, multi-organ failure (MOF) and even death [9]. Furthermore, the infection also initiates an increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines such as IL4 and IL10. These suppress inflammation and this phenomenon is not seen with SARS-CoV infection [11].",

Recent studies have shown age-related changes in this pathway and associated T-cell defects that could account for the increased susceptibility of SARS-CoV infection in the elderly [12]. The mechanism involves respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) in the lungs that migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes and prime T-cells that in turn migrate to the lungs to mount an immune response. An age-related defect in T-cell function is linked to decreased migration of rDC because of increased levels of prostaglandin-D (PGD2) in ageing mice. The resulting poor T cell response is associated with severe infection [13].",

            "text": "DEC is a cheap and safe drug used for decades in the treatment of filariasis. It is known to have anti-inflammatory actions especially in the lungs, immune-modulatory effects and poorly defined anti-viral effects. The following observations and mechanisms are postulated to consider the role of DEC in treatment of COVID-19.1.DEC has a wide range of immune-related effects. The main immune modularity mechanism is through its inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to form prostaglandins including PGD2 [14]. Ageing lung is associates with high levels of PGD2, a compound produced from arachidonic acid through the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes. The effects of increased PGD2 include a defect in T-cell function. Since DEC inhibits production of PGD2, it should theoretically enhance T cell responses against respiratory viruses in older humans.2.DEC therapy has also been shown to enhance antibody production in mice immunized with tetanus toxoid and the cytokine response in animals immunized with LPS both of which facilitates the immune response against microbes [15].3.Action of DEC on lung injury has been studied using models of acute inflammation. Carrageenan induced pleurisy had increased cellularity, mild haemorrhage and congestion, apoptotic cells, inflammatory cells (mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells), pulmonary oedema, emphysema and collagen fibers, all of which are attenuated with DEC pre-treatment [16]. This is relevant because carrageenan induced pleural inflammation causes an increase in local IL-1 activity in the pleural exudate [17]. Its anti-inflammatory effects have been useful in treatment of follicular cystitis of bladder \u2013 an inflammatory condition resistant to antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents [18].4.In addition, there is some evidence to support the anti-viral activity of DEC against RNA viruses. Mice inoculated with murine leukemic virus, survived significantly longer when they were given DEC [19].\n",
