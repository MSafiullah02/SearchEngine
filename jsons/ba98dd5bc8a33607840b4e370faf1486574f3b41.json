In this Letter, we show that degree dispersion-the fact that the number of local connections in networks varies broadly-increases the probability of large, rare fluctuations in population networks generically. We perform explicit calculations for two canonical and distinct classes of rare events: network extinction and switching. When the distance to threshold is held constant, and hence stochastic effects are fairly compared among networks, we show that there is a universal, exponential increase in the rate of rare events proportional to the variance of a network's degree distribution over its mean squared.",

            "text": "Systems containing a large, yet finite, population of interacting individuals or dynamical units often experience fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of agent interactions and local dynamics. Most of the time such systems reside in the vicinity of some attractor, undergoing small random excursions around it. Yet, occasionally a rare large fluctuation, on the order of the typical system size, may occur, which can lead to a transition to an absorbing state (a state that, once entered, cannot be left) or to the vicinity of another attractor. As a result, stochasticity can turn deterministically stable attractors into metastable states [1] . Examples of such extreme, rare events, which may be of key practical importance include population extinction [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , switching in gene regulatory networks [7] [8] [9] [10] , the arrival of biomolecules at small cellular receptors [11] , and power-grid destabilization [12] [13] [14] .",

In this case, analytical treatment is possible using standard techniques [6, 9, 15] . On the other hand, it is known that in topologically heterogeneous networks, e.g., where nodes have a variable degree, the critical behavior can be dramatically affected [16] [17] [18] [19] . Unfortunately, predicting rare events in degree-heterogenous networks is notoriously difficult, due to high dimensionality and complex coupling between degrees of freedom. Though some progress has been made by applying semiclassical approximations to master equations governing stochastic dynamics in complex systems [20] [21] [22] , often the resulting Hamilton equations are difficult to solve, as they require computing unstable trajectories in high-dimensional phase spaces [23] [24] [25] [26] . Consequently, analyzing rare events in general networks has been mainly limited to near-bifurcation regimes, where dimensionality is reduced.",

Next, we assume that the network settles into a long-lived metastable state prior to extinction. This assumption is justified if N is large, and the mean time to extinction (MTE), T, is very long. This metastable state, which is described by a quasistationary distribution (QSD) about the stable fixed point, slowly decays in time at a rate which equals 1=T, while simultaneously the extinction probability grows and reaches the value of 1 at infinite time [1, 4] .

As a consequence, we have obtained an exponential increase in the rate of extinction due to network heterogeneity, which only depends on the CV of the network's degree distribution. In Fig. 1 we demonstrate that in the limit of \u03f5 \u226a 1 our analytical results (7) agree well with numerical solutions of the Hamilton equations, obtained using the iterative action minimization method [26, 33] . Given our analysis for bimodal networks, it is straightforward to generalize to arbitrary, symmetric degree distributions, first, and then to skewed distributions. Let us denote by g\u00f0k\u00de the node degree distribution. That is, if N k are the number of nodes of degree k such that P k N k \u00bc N, we have g\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc N k =N. We assume that g\u00f0k\u00de is a symmetric distribution about the mean k 0 \u2261 hki, such that g\u00f0k 0 \u00fe i\u00de \u00bc g\u00f0k 0 \u2212 i\u00de for i \u00bc 1; 2; 3; \u2026.

We again denote by n k the number of infected individuals on degree-k nodes, and by x k \u00bc \u00bd1=g\u00f0k\u00den k =N \u00bc n k =N k the fraction of such infected individuals. Writing down the master equation for P fn k g -the joint probability to find \u00f0n k min ; \u2026; n k max \u00de infected nodes of degree k, and using the above WKB formalism, P\u00f0x\u00de \u223c e \u2212NS\u00f0x\u00de , where x \u00bc \u00f0x k min ; \u2026; x k max \u00de, we arrive at a Hamiltonian equivalent to [21] .

(9), as long as such distributions are symmetric in the vicinity of their mean and their skewness is small. In fact, one can show that if these conditions are met, the errors contributed from neglected terms, outside of the symmetrical bulk, are negligible [33] . This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 where we show that theoretical expression (9) agrees well with numerics, also in the case of asymmetric gamma distributions. Moreover, in the Supplemental Material we show that our results even hold for power-law networks when the CV is not too large [33] .",

The stable fixed points emerge at a pitchfork bifurcation when \u03bb \u00bc \u03bb c \u2261 hki=hk 2 i.

In the spin model, demographic noise causes switching between x \u00c3 and \u2212x \u00c3 [38] .

As a consequence, the deterministic trajectory starting from the vicinity of the unstable point 0 and ending at the stable fixed point x \u00c3 coincides up to time reversal, with the fluctuational path from x \u00c3 to 0 [1] .

We computed the rate of increase of rare events, and showed that it depends solely on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the network's degree distribution, but is independent of the exact type of network and connectivity matrix. A key insight therein, was to compare different networks with the same distance to threshold, such that deterministic or fluctuation-free stability was held constant, while propensities for noise-induced fluctuations could be isolated. We found that the rate of extinction or switching can be dramatically increased, as long as the CV of the network's degree distribution exceeds N \u22121=2 , which is a reasonable assumption for realistic networks. Finally, we have shown that our approach is valid in processes with maintained as well as broken detailed balance, holds across a broad range of network topologies, and generalizes to different noise sources [33] . Thus, we conjecture that our results are applicable to rare events in a wider range of network processes driven by noise, which include local interactions, and where fluctuations drive a network from a metastable state to an unstable state who merge in a single fixed-point bifurcation [33] .

Left panel: MTE versus the degree dispersion for several networks; for each point, a mean time is computed from 200 stochastic realizations in a fixed network with a given degree distribution. This is repeated for 20 different network realizations with the same degree distribution and the same number of edges. The log of all such averages is then averaged. Error bars are given by the standard deviation of the latter.
