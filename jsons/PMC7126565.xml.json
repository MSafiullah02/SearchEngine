Cystatins SN, SA, and S are predominantly expressed in human submandibular gland and sublingual gland (Isemura et al., 1984, Isemura et al., 1986, Isemura et al., 1987, Isemura et al., 1991, Saitoh and Isemura, 1993); however, cystatin D is found in the parotid gland (Freije et al., 1993). Cystatin C and cystatin E/M are widely expressed ubiquitously in various human tissues (Abrahamson, 1994, Abrahamson et al., 2003, Sotiropoulou et al., 1997, Ni et al., 1997), while cystatin F (leukocystatin) is abundant in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes (Ni et al., 1998, Halfon et al., 1998). Three recently discovered inhibitors (cystatins 8, 9, and 11) are predominantly expressed in the male reproductive tract (Cornwall et al., 1999, Eriksson et al., 2002, Hamil et al., 2002).",

Cystatins in saliva have been shown to inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and infectious viruses including coronavirus, poliovirus, and herpes simplex virus, suggesting that salivary cystatins may play a role as defense factors (Blankenvoorde et al., 1996, Abrahamson et al., 2003). Furthermore, cystatins of this class have been demonstrated not only to induce interleukin-6 production by human gingival fibroblast via its surface molecules (Kato et al., 2000, Kato et al., 2002) but also interferon gamma expression in CD4 positive T cells (Kato et al., 2004). Defining levels of a target cystatin in human body fluids and detecting a specific cystatin in tissues are helpful tools for investigating the physiological roles of each cystatin. In the course of studying the roles of family 2 cystatin, we conceived of producing highly specific monoclonal antibodies that could discriminate the structural differences between human salivary cystatins S, SN, and SA. These promise to provide a clinical trail for the cystatins.",

Three days after the final immunization, the mice were bled, and the sera were separated by centrifugation. The reactivities and titers of antisera to cystatin SA1 or SA2 were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hybridomas were produced by the polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000; Sigma Chemical) fusion of SP2 murine myeloma cells with splenocytes from the immunized mice as described previously (Kato et al., 1989). To produce antibody against cystatins SA1 and/or SA2, viable hybridomas were screened by ELISA and then cloned twice by the limiting dilution method. Monoclonal antibody isotypes were determined by using a monoclonal subisotyping kit (American Qualex Company, San Clemente, CA, USA). The reactivities of the monoclonal antibodies were confirmed by an ELISA system. Large quantities of the monoclonal antibodies were produced by intraperitoneal injection of hybridoma cells into pristane-treated BALB/c mice. After 7\u201314 days, the ascites containing high concentrations of antibodies, were harvested. All of this study followed \u201cA Guideline for the Treatment of Experimental Animals in Tokyo Dental College\u201d.",

Two monoclonal antibodies were then added either separately or simultaneously, and the amount of bound antibody was quantitatively measured. Additivity of the bound activity is observed when the monoclonal antibodies bind to distinct epitopes.

The antiserum against r-cystatin SA2 (polyclonal) revealed almost the same cross-reactivity as the antiserum mentioned above. To obtain highly specific antibodies for human cystatin SA1 or its variant (SA2), we attempted to produce monoclonal antibodies using r-cystatin SA1 or r-cystatin SA2. Eventually, we were able to select two hybridomas harboring the monoclonal antibodies for r-cystatin SA1 and r-cystatin SA2, which are designated, respectively, as Cys3F11and Cys2E5 (see Table 1\n). By ELISA, the antibody Cys2E5 (IgG1 isotype) was found to show a strong reactivity with r-cystatin SA2 and a weak cross-reactivity with r-cystatin SA1 (22% cross-reactivity) and plasma cystatin C (18% cross-reactivity). The Cys3F11 (IgG1 isotype) was demonstrated to react not only with r-cystatin SA1 but also with r-cystatin SA2 (89% cross-reactivity) and plasma cystatin C (47% cross-reactivity). Neither monoclonal antibody reacted with any other cystatin tested, including r-cystatins S, SN, D, and E/M or egg white cystatin, as shown in Table 1. The epitope specificity of the two monoclonal antibodies was then analyzed by ELISA additivity test. This assay requires that the antigen be saturated with each antibody tested. Accordingly, we determined the lowest concentration of each antibody at which saturation was achieved and used concentrations to perform ELISA with single and with mixed pair of antibodies. As shown in Table 2\n, AI for Cys3F11 and Cys2E5 was 64%. This result shows that the bindings of the two monoclonal antibodies are additive, suggesting that these antibodies bind to distinct epitopes.",

Fig. 2 (lanes A and B) clearly demonstrated that immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies do not provide positive signals for non-phosphorylated cystatin S, mono-phosphorylated cystatin S, di-phosphorylated cystatin S, or cystatin SN. The immunoblot with Cys3F11 showed two positive bands for cystatins SA1 and SA2 with almost the equal intensity; however, Cys2E5 formed a strongly reacting band with cystatin SA2 and a faint band (indicated by the arrowhead) with cystatin SA1, as seen in Fig. 2. These observations emphasize that the monoclonal antibody, Cys2E5, can discriminate the structural differences between cystatins SA1 and SA2, both of which are encoded by the CST2 locus. Neither monoclonal antibody showed a positive reaction with cystatin D in the immunoblot by acidic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown).",
