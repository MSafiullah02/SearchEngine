The biosynthesis of these glycan chains takes place mostly in compartments of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway, in stepwise reactions involving specific nucleotide sugar transporters, glycosyltransferases, glycosidases and other glycan-modifying enzymes. 1, 2 Expression of some of these gene products is altered in embryogenesis, cancer, injury and inflammation, resulting in altered glycan patterns. Sialic acids (sias) are typically the outermost monosaccharide units on the glycan chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins ( Figure 1a ) and are often part of recognition sites to which pathogens attach. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] On the other hand, they also serve important intrinsic functions and are required for normal development. 10, 11 This brief review focuses on the many ways in which Sias can present themselves on cell surfaces, some examples from our own work of the resulting implications for normal biology and disease, and some immunohistological tools used to detect this diversity in situ.",

            "text": "Sias share a nine-carbon backbone and are among the most diverse sugars found on glycan chains of mammalian cell surfaces (Figure 1b) . A variety of linkages to the underlying sugar chain from the 2-position and various types of substitutions at the 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 positions combine to generate this diversity. 4, 5 Given their terminal location on glycans, it is natural that this diversity has been utilized by a wide variety of Sia-binding proteins. 11 Best known are the binding proteins of many viral and bacterial pathogens. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In addition, there are intrinsic receptors within vertebrate cells that can recognize Sias, including the selectins and the Siglecs. Details regarding these binding proteins have been reviewed elsewhere. 5, 9, [11] [12] [13] EXAMPLES OF THE PATHOBIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SIALIC ACID DIVERSITY Examples of Sialic Acid Specificity in Pathogen Binding Influenza A pathogenesis Perhaps the earliest discovered 'function' of Sias was to serve as a receptor for the influenza A and B viruses ( Figure 1c ). 14, 15 Most influenza viruses that infect and spread among wild and domesticated birds preferentially recognize Sias that are a2-3-linked to the underlying glycan chains (the most recent example being the H5N1 'bird flu' virus). Humans are resistant to infection by such viruses at least partly because we instead display a2-6-linked Sias on the epithelium of upper airways (see Figure 2a ). Thus, in order for avian influenza viruses to become human pathogens, certain specific mutations must occur in the Sia-binding pocket of the virus hemagglutinin. This is thought to occur in intermediate hosts such as the pig, which has both a2-3 and a2-6 linked Sias on its airways. 14 However, there has been at least one instance (the 1918 influenza pandemic) wherein the virus adjusted to bind both types of linkages 16, 17 and 'jumped' directly from birds into humans. Recent infections of a few humans with the bird flu have fortunately been traced not to such a change in virus-binding specificity, but likely exposure to a very large dose, which reached the lower airways and bound to a2-3-linked Sias present at that location. 15 This can also explain why these patients did not easily pass on their infections to other humans. 19 Frozen sections of rat liver were blocked for endogenous peroxidases, fixed in formalin, washed, overlaid with the CHE-FcD or Che-Fc probes, which were pre-complexed with HRP anti-human antibodies at predetermined dilutions. After incubation at 41C for 2 h, sections were washed in PBS and color developed using the AEC substrate with Mayer's hematoxylin for nuclear counterstain.

Frozen sections of a human colon carcinoma were blocked for endogenous peroxidases, fixed in formalin, washed and overlaid with a chicken anti-Neu5Gc antibody. 38 Following washes and incubation with HRP-labeled donkey anti-chicken antibody and further washes, color was developed using the AEC substrate with Mayer's hematoxylin for nuclear counterstain. The right panel shows a negative control using a nonspecific chicken IgY. (d) Detection of GD3 and de-N-acetylated GD3 in human melanomas. Left Panel: detection of GD3 using MAb R24. Right Panel: detection of de-N-acetyl-GD3 using MAb SGR37. Unfixed frozen sections of a human melanoma were blocked for endogenous peroxidases and overlaid with monoclonal antibodies R24 or SGR37. 33 Following PBS washes, incubation with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig antibodies and further washes, color was developed using the AEC substrate with Mayer's hematoxylin for nuclear counterstain.

This finding also allowed development of recombinant soluble forms of the influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase, which can be used as probes to detect the presence of 9-O-acetylated Sias in situ, after inactivation of the esterase activity ( Figure 2b) . 7, 19 Malaria In another example, invasion of red blood cells by the merozoite stage of Plasmodium falciparum is often dependent on the presence of Sia (although some Sia-independent binding mechanisms have emerged in this virulent pathogen). Different proteins on the Plasmodium merozoites govern the binding to red blood cells. We have found that the differential susceptibility of humans and chimpanzees to P. falciparum and P. reichnowii malarial parasites, respectively, might be explained by the differential preference of the parasitebinding proteins for human and nonhuman Sias. 20 Thus, the change in Sias associated with human evolution (see below) was likely characterized by a phase in which our ancestors escaped from the common malaria of apes, only to later become the target for P. falciparum, which prefers the human Sia phenotype.",

The first example correlates with the upregulation of the expression of the ST6GAL1 gene, and has been described in carcinomas of the colon, breast, cervix, choriocarcinomas, acute myeloid leukemias and some malignancies of the brain as well. 26 This may relate to the effects of a2-6-linked Sias on integrin function. 27 In the case of Sialyl-Lewis X expression, it appears that tumor cells use this selectin ligand to facilitate interactions with the selectins. Tumor emboli and microthrombi result when carcinoma selectin ligands on hematogenously borne carcinoma cells interact with selectins on platelets, innate immune cells and endothelium, serving to propagate metastases. 28, 29 The serendipitous finding that some clinically approved heparins can block many of these selectin-mediated processes at clinically acceptable levels might explain why heparins reduce the incidence of metastasis, when utilized during the 'window of therapeutic opportunity'. [28] [29] [30] Gangliosides are glycolipids carrying Sias, which are found in all tissues and cell types, but are particularly enriched in cells of neuroectodermal origin. Malignant melanomas express very high levels of the disialoganglioside GD3 as well as modified 9-O-acetylated 31,32 and 5-N-deacetylated 33 forms of this ganglioside. Antibodies against all three forms are available and can be used to study their expression and distribution in melanomas (see example in Figure 2d ). Enhanced expression of 9-O-acetyl-GD3 is also seen in basal cell carcinomas. 34 There is evidence that whereas GD3 enhances apoptosis, 9-O-acetyl-GD3 has the opposite effect. 35 There are multiple other examples of monoclonal antibodies recognizing specific gangliosides, which must be used on frozen sections, as the paraffin-embedding process results in extraction of gangliosides. 33 ",

            "text": "Plant lectins. Lectins are glycan-binding proteins, which have traditionally been powerful tools to explore glycan structures. 45 Their specificity is such that even isomeric glycans with identical sugar compositions can be distinguished. A well-known example is Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), which binds in a highly selective fashion to Sias attached to either galactose or GalNAc units, via a2-6-linkages. 46 In contrast to SNA, the family of lectins from Maackia amurensis seeds recognize a2-3-linked Sias. There is confusion in the literature regarding Maackia lectins, not only because there are more than one of differing specificity, but also because commercial sources sell them under different names. Preparations called 'MAA' are typically unspecified mixtures of two Maackia lectins, that is, one originally identified as a 'leukoagglutinin' (MAL) and a second one, a 'hemagglutinin' (MAH). [47] [48] [49] As these two lectins have differing specificity, the significance of any published results using 'MAA' preparations must be interpreted cautiously. A further complication arises because the MAL lectin is sometimes sold as 'MAL-I' and MAH as 'MAL-II'. 49 Finally, MAL can also recognize a glycan wherein the Sia is replaced with a sulfate ester at the 3-position of galactose. 50 Clearly, use of these lectins must be better controlled if interpretations are to be accurate. Also, such plant lectins are sometimes used with the assumption that they bind all forms of Sias, which is not the case. A lectin less often used that better recognizes multiple forms of Sias is the Limax flavus agglutinin. 51 Recombinant soluble microbial proteins. A variety of microbial binding proteins and toxins specifically bind certain structures containing Sias. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Thus, recombinant soluble versions of these molecules (or even intact virions bearing them) can be used to detect the relevant ligands in situ. Examples include cholera toxin, which binds selectively to GM1 ganglioside and the influenza C hemaggluttinin, which selectively recognizes 9-O-acetylated-Sia residues (see text).",

            "text": "Natural diversity in Sia presentation, structure and function. (a) Diversity in presentation. Sias are typically found at the terminal position of N-and O-linked glycans attached to the cell surface and to secreted glycoproteins, as well as on glycosphingolipids expressed at the cell surface. Ac, O-acetyl ester; Fuc, fucose; Gal, galactose; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; Glc, glucose; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Man, mannose; S, sulfate ester. Reproduced with permission from Varki. 11 (b) Structural diversity. All Sias share the common feature of having nine carbons, a carboxylic acid residue at the 1-position, and a variety of linkages to the underlying sugar chain from the 2-position. Various types of substitutions at the 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 positions combine with the linkage variation to generate the diversity of Sias found in nature. Only a portion of this diversity is represented here. Some examples of the binding specificity of probes for detection of Sia types and linkages are discussed in the Box 1. (c) Examples of pathobiological interactions involving Sias. This cartoon shows examples of the types of interactions involving recognition of Sia diversity. The molecules and cells are obviously not drawn to scale.",

(a) Differential display of a2-6-linked Sias on the ciliary border of lung bronchial epithelial cells in humans and chimpanzees. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and blocked for endogenous biotin and overlaid with biotinylated Sambucus Nigra agglutinin (SNA), followed by Tris-buffered saline washes, alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin and additional washes. Color detection used a Vector Labs blue substrate and nuclear fast red counterstain. Arrows point to the epithelial luminal edge, where staining is seen in humans, but not in chimpanzees or in other great apes.18 (b) Expression of 9-O-acetylated Sias in rat liver. Left panel: DFP-treated recombinant soluble influenza C Hemagglutinin-esterase (CHE-FcD). Right panel: non-DFP-treated version of the same probe (CHE-Fc, esterase active, negative binding control).",
