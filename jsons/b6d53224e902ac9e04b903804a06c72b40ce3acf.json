The significantly larger number of influenza hospitalized cases from 2017 to 2018 might be attributed to higher detection rate and more frequent turnover time of beds. A significantly larger number of hospitalized patients during 2017-2018 did not receive antiviral therapy within 48 h from symptom onset, and a higher number of these patients died, In addition, we found that inpatients with influenza during the 2017-2018 season were more frequently smoking than the 2011-2017 seasons, recognizing the increased risk of smoking during influenza epidemics and pandemics [20] . Our study highlights the importance of encouraging people to vaccinate against influenza, which remain a huge challenge in China-none of the inpatients in our study had received seasonal influenza vaccination prior to the epidemic. When we analyzed the characteristics of inpatients with influenza among different age groups during the 2011-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons, we found less frequent prescription of oseltamivir to inpatients aged 14-59 years and over 60 years during the 2017-2018 season, but the inpatients who were younger than 14 years had increased coverage with oseltamivir. Following the standardization of influenza treatment with oseltamivir, the clinical demand for oseltamivir increased greatly, and medical institutions, pharmacy terminals and families of drug buyers all stocked oseltamivir in the short term, resulting in insufficient supply in the short-term in China [21] . Oseltamivir is the preferred treatment for younger patients, owing to shortage of manpower in the pediatric departments and the emotions of parents, and this also contributed to the abuse of oseltamivir [22] . More data and rationale are needed to define whether the insufficient supply of oseltamivir in adults (> 14 years) may have increased risk for death during influenza outbreak in China. Stockpiling of Tamiflu\u00ae (oseltamivir) against pandemic threats has been initiated by several countries, with Britain for example pushing ahead with its plan of stockpiling Tamiflu at \u00a349 m (\u20ac60 m; $80 m) to maintain its stockpile of antivirals in case of a flu pandemic [23] .",

Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and gender showed that the hospitalized patients with influenza during the 2017-2018 season had many potential risk factors for death but age and gender were not associated with an increased risk of death among inpatients during A potential limitation of this study is that we may had overestimated the in-hospital fatality due to influenza, since inclusion criteria required an identification of specific influenza types and subtypes, and deaths were more likely to receive clinically clear diagnosis than survival cases. However, this limitation does not have an effect on the comparison of different influenza seasons. Because the number of influenza patients had increased significantly in 2017/18 season, and hospital beds are limited and stable, only more severe patients can be admitted to the hospital this season. We may had overestimated the in-hospital fatality in 2017/18 season due to the selection bias. Our study focused on infection due to types and subtypes of seasonal influenza viruses during the 2011-2018, however comparison to other respiratory infections such as the respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus should be further explored to better understand pathogenesis due to influenza viruses. Additionally, due to the collection of data from five different hospitals, inherent differences in practice and training over time may have had a bias in case selection. Finally, we did not include cases of mixed infections (the mixed infection of influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B; the mixed infection of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and cases of influenza A that were not specified classified, so data on these cases could have some impact on our results.",

ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; AMCI, acute myocardial infarction; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; MOF, multiple organ failure; ALI, acute lung injury; MOF, multiple organ failure. Patients in 2017-2018 also presented frequently with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6.9% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.05), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.9% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.05) and multiple organ failure (MOF) (3.1% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.05), and were more likely to have respiratory failure (21.5% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.01), acute lung injury (ALI) (24.9% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.01) and secondary bacterial infection (24.9% vs. 7.7%, p < 0.01), than in all previous seasons.
