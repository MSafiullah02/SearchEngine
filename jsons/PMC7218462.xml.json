AF is a common sequela of critical illness, with an estimated prevalence of almost 10% in ICU patients, and several studies report worse outcomes in patients with new-onset AF as compared with their non-AF counterparts.25,26 Sinus rhythm restoration is of high priority as it improves the patient\u2019s hemodynamics.

In some cases, it is observed that tachycardia continues despite adequate volume resuscitation.33 Our patient also displayed anemia with mild rhabdomyolysis, which was managed with judicious intravenous crystalloid hydration.",
