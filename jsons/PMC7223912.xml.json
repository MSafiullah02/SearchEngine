It is estimated that 53,000 people die each year from TBI in the United States and more than 5.3 million Americans are currently disabled for TBI [2]. Patients who have undergone TBI often suffer from profound suppression of the cellular immune system and impaired consciousness [3], and they usually require tracheal intubation and ventilator support [4], both of which increased the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).",

In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that the risk factors for VAP among patients with TBI include smoking, higher injury severity score (ISS), tracheostomy, diabetes, and so on [8\u201312]. However, these studies did not provide consistent evidence for prevention and treatment due to many reasons, such as small sample sizes, different population sources, and the use of different study designs [11, 12]. What is more, some studies indicated that VAP increased the risk of mortality [13, 14], but other studies showed that VAP was not associated with mortality [9, 15]. Identification of risk factors and outcomes associated with VAP could permit clinical staff to provide close infection surveillance and timely care for TBI patients at high risk for pneumonia. Therefore, a systematic summary is urgently needed.",

Stratified analysis based on variation in the region was applied because of its potential effect on the incidence of VAP (Fig. 2c), and the results showed that the incidence of VAP in North America (39%) and Europe (40%) was relatively higher than Asia (28%). We also performed a subgroup analysis by definition of VAP (Fig. 2d), and the results showed the incidence of VAP in Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria [28], American Thoracic Society criteria [29], Chinese Respiratory Society criteria [30] with 34%, 32%, 38%, respectively. Considering the impact of TBI severity on the incidence of VAP, we performed a subgroup analysis based on the severity of TBI (Fig. 2e), and the result showed that the incidences of VAP in severe TBI patients (defined according to the standards used in the original study, such as Glasgow coma score (GCS) \u2264 8, the presence of clinical or radiographic herniation, etc.) and all TBI patients were similar, with 35% and 39%, respectively. In addition to the overall incidence of VAP, some studies divided VAP into early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (EOVAP) and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (LOVAP). The results showed that the incidences of EOVAP (occurring in the first 3\u20137 days of mechanical ventilation) and LOVAP (occurring after 3\u20137 days of mechanical ventilation) were 26% and 16%, respectively (Fig. 2f, g).",

We found a significant relationship between VAP and the following risk factors: smoking, tracheostomy, blood transfusion on admission, barbiturate infusion, ISS, head abbreviated injury scale (AIS), as noted in Table 3. The data demonstrated that smoking increased the risk for VAP among patients with TBI (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.16\u20133.92; P < 0.05)**. Additionally patients with tracheostomy were more vulnerable to VAP (OR 9.55; 95% CI 3.24\u201328.17; P < 0.05). What is more, blood transfusion on admission also increased the risk for VAP (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.24\u20135.18; P < 0.05). Additionally, barbiturate infusion increased the risk for VAP among patients with TBI (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.68\u20137.40; P < 0.05). After data integration of three studies, pooled results showed that patients with higher ISS were more likely to be diagnosed with VAP compared to those with lower ISS (OR 4.65; 95% CI 1.96\u20137.34; P < 0.05). Moreover, patients with head AIS \u2265 3 were more vulnerable to VAP (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.66\u20135.37; P < 0.05). No significant differences were detected based on gender (male), age, diabetes, shock, prophylactic antibiotics, corticosteroids, abdomen AIS, thorax AIS, thorax trauma, spinal trauma, facial trauma, abdomen trauma; therefore, these factors were determined not to be risk factors for VAP. The forest plots of risk factors are described in Figure S1.",

First, the criteria used to diagnose VAP in the included studies were inconsistent and the analyzed studies used the following methods for VAP ascertainment: Three studies used the CDC criteria [28], two studies used the American Thoracic Society criteria [29], one study used the Chinese Respiratory Society criteria [30], nine studies were based on clinical, radiographical and microbiological criteria to provide references for doctors\u2019 diagnosis. In addition, the cutoff points used to define EOVAP and LOVAP in the included studies were inconsistent. For example, some studies defined that VAP occurring in the first 4 days after mechanical ventilation was EOVAP [9], while some studies defined that VAP occurring in the first 7 days after mechanical ventilation was EOVAP [23]. We recommend that more research about EOVAP and LOVAP be conducted in the future, so as to get more accurate knowledge about it. There are still many uncertainties in the diagnosis of VAP, which needs further research.",
