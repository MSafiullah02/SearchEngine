Emerging concepts in free radical biology are now shedding light on the pathogenesis of various diseases. Freeradical induced pathogenicity in virus infections is of great importance, because evidence suggests that NO and oxygen radicals such as superoxide are key molecules in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. Although oxygen radicals and NO have an antimicrobial effect on bacteria and protozoa, they have opposing effects in virus infections such as influenza virus pneumonia and several other neurotropic virus infections. A high output of NO from inducible NO synthase, occurring in a variety of virus infections, produces highly reactive nitrogen oxide species, such as peroxynitrite, via interaction with oxygen radicals and reactive oxygen intermediates. The production of these various reactive species confers the diverse biological functions of NO. The reactive nitrogen species cause oxidative tissue injury and mutagenesis through oxidation and nitration of various biomolecules. The unique biological properties of free radicals are further illustrated by recent evidence showing accelerated viral mutation by NO-induced oxidative stress. NO appears to affect a host's immune response, with immunopathological consequences. For example, NO is reported to suppress type 1 helper T celldependent immune responses during infections, leading to type 2 helper T cell-biased immunological host responses. NO-induced immunosuppression may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of virus infections and help expansion of quasispecies population of viral pathogens. This review describes the pathophysiological roles of free radicals in the pathogenesis of viral disease and in viral mutation as related to both nonspecific inflammatory responses and immunological host reactions modulated by NO.",

During the past decade, considerable evidence has revealed unique and diverse biological functions of NO, a gaseous nitrogen-centred inorganic free radical produced endogenously in a number of cells and tissues [8] [9] [10] . NO and reactive oxygen species, including O 2 x , hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hypochlorite anion (OCl x ), are generated by infiltrating phagocytic cells and xanthine oxidase (XO) expressed in inflamed tissues [6, 7, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . They are believed to contribute to nonspecific (innate) and immunological host defence as well [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . It is now well accepted that the chemical and biological reactivities of NO produced in environments such as inflamed tissues are greatly affected by concomitantly formed oxygen radicals, particularly O 2",

Akaike caused by inducible NO synthase (iNOS), which is usually expressed by inflammatory phagocytic cells and other types of cells (e.g. epithelial and neuronal cells) [1] [2] [3] 8, 9] . iNOS produces a much larger amount of NO (i.e. 10-100 times more) for a longer time than do the other two constitutive enzymes, neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS. It seems that iNOS is ubiquitously expressed during host responses to viral replication in vivo. iNOS expression is observed in human diseases caused by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [36, 37] . It is induced in a variety of experimental virus infections in rats and mice, including infections with neuroviruses, such as Borna disease virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and rabies virus, and pneumotropic and cardiotropic viruses, such as influenza virus, SeV and coxsackievirus [12] [13] [14] [15] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . For example, iNOS is expressed by exudate macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells in lung tissues infected with either influenza virus or SeV in mice; the high output of NO has been clearly identified and quantified by ESR spin trapping with the use of a dithiocarbamate-iron complex [13] [14] [15] [43] [44] [45] . NO-dithiocarbamate-iron adducts with a triplet hyperfine structure of g perpendicular 2.04 are generated ( Figure 1 ). The production of these adducts is completely nullified by pharmacological inhibition of NOS by the use of N v -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or by genetic disruption of iNOS [43] [44] [45] , indicating that excessive production of NO is due to localised iNOS expression in the tissues infected with virus. iNOS induction in virus infection is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-c (IFN-c) ( Figure 2 ). IFN-c is known to be associated with type 1 helper T cell (Th1) responses. In pneumonia induced by influenza virus or SeV, NO production is greatly attenuated in IFN-cdeficient mice (Akaike et al., unpublished observation). Furthermore, the iNOS-inducing potential in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in influenza virus pneumonia is attributable solely to IFN-c, as revealed by an immunoadsorption study using a specific anti-IFN-c antibody [43] . These results strongly support the suggestion that IFN-c is a major cytokine inducing iNOS and NO overproduction in the pathogenesis of virus infection.",

In addition, these suppressor cytokines may reduce NO production indirectly via induction of arginase [49] [50] [51] , which diminishes the supply of the substrate (L-arginine) for iNOS. Because IL-4 and IL-10 are induced by type 2 helper T cell (Th2) responses, iNOS expression may be regulated by a balance between Th1 and Th2 responses involved in the host immune response to the intruding virus. In fact, in our influenza model, induction of IL-4 seems to be inversely related to INF-c and iNOS induction in virus-infected lungs, suggesting downregulation by IL-4 of NO overproduction [13] . Induction of arginase 1 mRNA has been identified in virusinfected lung, and the time profile of its induction paralleled the induction of IL-4 (our unpublished observation). Therefore, iNOS expression and the resultant NO biosynthesis seem to undergo elegant regulation by a polarised Th1-Th2 balance ( Figure 2 ).",

An envelope glycoprotein of HIV, gp41, triggers iNOS expression in human astrocytes and murine cortical brain cells in culture [52, 53] . Thus, NO produced by iNOS may contribute directly to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia and cardiomyopathy as well [36, [52] [53] [54] [55] . Similarly, the human paramyxovirus respiratory syncytial virus directly upregulates iNOS in human type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cells) through a pathway independent of proinflammatory cytokines [56] . It is also interesting that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed during viral replication upregulates iNOS in human respiratory epithelial cells by triggering dsRNA-activated protein kinase coupled with nuclear factor-kB and IFN regulatory factor 1 activation [57] . There are therefore two pathways for iNOS induction in virus infections: cytokine-dependent mechanisms and direct upregulation by virus.",

This lack of antiviral activity of NO has been verified in murine pneumotropic virus infections caused by influenza virus and SeV in a series of our in vitro and in vivo studies (Akaike et al., unpublished observation) [43, 45] .

            "text": "x takes place in virus-infected inflammatory tissues, leading to the formation of ONOO x . ONOO x nitrates aromatic organic compounds such as tyrosine very effectively, so that nitration of free or protein-bound tyrosine to give 3-nitrotyrosine can serve as a footprint of ONOO x formed in vivo [17, 20, 21] . Indeed, immunohistochemical analysis with antinitrotyrosine antibody shows positive staining in macrophages and neutrophils infiltrating the alveoli and interstitial tissues, as well as in inflammatory intraalveolar exudate x and H 2 O 2 and heavy metals (particularly iron and copper). ONOO x and NO 2 mediate oxidative and nitrative stresses through oxidation and nitration of various biomolecules including protein, lipid and nucleic acid [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . NO 2 is generated via oxidation of nitrite catalysed by peroxidases such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) (plus H 2 O 2 ) from neutrophils [137] . Ceruloplasmin (CP) and copper ion catalyse oneelectron oxidation of NO to form nitrosonium cation (NO + ), which is involved in nitrosative signalling [69, 88] . The best known NOdependent pathway is mediated by cyclic guanosine 3k,5k-monophosphate (cGMP), which is produced by soluble guanylate cyclase activation by NO-heme iron binding in the vicinity of the catalytic site of the enzyme [138] Free radicals in virus infection from virus-infected lung in our experimental models [43, 45] , which provides indirect evidence of ONOO x generation during virus infection. In addition to causing various pathological events in virus infections, such as host cell apoptosis and necrosis, ONOO x may be involved in NO-induced suppressive effects on immune effector cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes, as described in detail in a later section. We also found that ONOO x activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in extracellular tissue damage and remodelling [91] . Oxidative injury in virus-infected tissues may thus be mediated by ONOO x -induced MMP activation. In fact, remarkable improvements in pathological conditions in the lung and in the survival rate of virus-infected mice were observed with L-NMMA treatment, with the use of the O 2",

These oxygen and nitrogen reactive intermediates, however, cannot discriminate between exogenous invading pathogens and the hosts themselves, so they function as mediators of nonspecific innate defence against various microbes. Autotoxicity can also occur so that host organisms discard expendable parts. To minimise such self-sacrifice during the elimination of pathogens, a host has primitive tactics, using recruited phagocytes, for physical containment of pathogens in infectious foci (Figure 4 , right panel). Most bacteria, for example, can be phagocytosed and confined to septic foci, which are typically abscesses or granulomas. Therefore, chemically reactive NO, O 2 x and ONOO x can affect bacteria rather selectively; the surrounding normal tissue remains intact. In virus infections, in contrast, free radical mediators cause nonspecific oxidative damage in virus-infected tissue and produce oxidative stress, because virus cannot be confined to limited areas by the nonspecific host defence mediated by phagocytes, NO and O 2 x (Figure 4 , left panel) [12] [13] [14] . Oxidative stress induced by free radical generation during virus infections may thus cause deleterious events in host-pathogen relationships.",

As described in earlier sections, overproduction of NO and oxygen radicals appears to be a common phenomenon in various infections. The resultant reactive molecular species such as ONOO x nonselectively affect the host's cells and tissues. Obviously, such host defence effectors are originally produced to kill the intruding pathogens, which then suffer oxidative stress because of the host. It may therefore be logical to assume that mutagenesis of various pathogens occurs during infections in biological systems as a result of host defence.",

A typical base substitution caused by ONOO x is G to T transversion, which is an indirect result of depurination of nitroguanine in DNA [22, 23] . A recent study by Wogan's group documented that a high output of NO induced mutations in an endogenous hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene of murine macrophages expressing iNOS [100] . Genetic analysis of the mutated gene induced by NO indicated that the NO-associated mutational spectrum was similar to that arising spontaneously, but small deletions and insertions were found in the NO-induced mutant gene. The same group showed that mutagenicity is enhanced with NO overproduction in vivo, as assessed by mutation of an exogenously expressed lacZ by using lacZ-containing pUR288 plasmid-transgenic mice [101] . Also important, Ohshima's group reported that p53 is inactivated by ONOO x , which may indirectly increase genetic mutation related to oxidative damage of DNA [102] . Excess production of NO by iNOS induced by inflammatory cytokines, possibly through reactive nitrogen intermediates (particularly ONOO x ), caused DNA damage and impaired DNA repair in human cholangiocarcinoma cells, as assessed by the comet assay, suggesting NO-dependent development and progression of cholangiocarcinoma [103] . It has been known for a long time that many naturally occurring mutagens and carcinogens may act as free radical generators [104] . Moreover, oxygen radicals and reactive oxygen species, as endogenous initiators of DNA damage and mutation, are involved in multiple stages of carcinogenesis [105] [106] [107] [108] .

Viruses containing RNA as their nucleic acid include a number of important pathogens causing various diseases in humans, animals and plants. RNA viruses exist as highly heterogeneous populations called quasispecies, primarily because of the error-prone nature of the replicase of the viruses. In fact, RNA viruses share a high mutation rate, ranging from 10 x5 to 10 x3 misincorporation/nucleotide site/round of copying, which is more than 10 4 -fold higher than the rate error for DNA viruses [109] [110] [111] [112] . The low fidelity of RNA replication is believed to be due to the lack of proofreading and repair functions of RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase [109, 113] . Our recent preliminary study, however, showed that RNA is chemically unstable, so that base modifications via ONOO x -induced oxidation and nitration occur more readily in viral RNA than in eukaryotic DNA (unpublished observation). Thus, the higher incidence of erroneous viral RNA replication may be partly due to RNA's greater susceptibility to oxidative damage compared with DNA.",

A previous study indicated that oxidative stress augmented the integration of duck HBV DNA into genomic DNA in cells by means of DNA damage and impairment of DNA repair [114] . Although this increased integration is related to proto-oncogene activation induced by hepatitis virus during carcinogenic processes rather than related to viral mutation, it may suggest that oxidative stress causes molecular alteration of viral DNA through mutagenic activities. Beck et al. showed that the pathogenicity of coxsackievirus B3 is strongly potentiated in vivo in mice fed a selenium-deficient diet [115] . More important, an avirulent strain of the virus is converted to a potent cardiotoxic variant during infection in selenium-depleted animals. The deficiency of selenium may result in an ineffective antioxidant system, e.g. low levels of glutathione peroxidase. The results of similar studies extended to animals deficient in vitamin E and glutathione peroxidase suggest that oxidative stress facilitates selection and generation of virulent mutants [116] . More specifically, the impaired immunological viral clearance related to oxidative stress may cause increased survival of heterogeneous mutants, resulting in the selection of highly pathogenic variants of coxsackievirus [117] . In this context, it is of great interest that NO has an immunosuppressive effect by means of modulation of the T cell immune response during virus infection, as described in the next section of this article.",

These criteria, however, cannot be used for accurate and quantitative assessment of viral mutation, because such phenotypic variants often contain multiple base alterations in different genes [118] . Identification of the escape mutant from neutralising antibody is much more reliable for the quantification of viral mutation. For example, escape of a virus from a particular neutralising monoclonal antibody occurs by a single base substitution, leading to a single codon change on the epitope. The frequency of escape mutants thus determined in cultured cells in vitro was within the same range, y10 x4.5 , for four different negative-strand RNA viruses: i.e. SeV, vesicular stomatitis virus, Newcastle disease virus and influenza A virus [119, 120] . Nevertheless, selection via antibody is not entirely established to be definitive and reproducible, because the frequencies fluctuate greatly, even within a given virus species, depending on the antibodies used for the selection [118] . This selection method has another flaw: it is not used for in vivo studies because of the natural immunological selection of the escape mutants during a host's immune response.",

There is growing awareness of the unique immunoregulatory function of NO, which appears to be mediated through cytotoxic or suppressive effects of NO on particular subsets of immune cells [3, [122] [123] [124] . Th cells, divided into two subsets (Th1 and Th2), protect hosts from intruding viral pathogens via virusspecific Th1 responses, potentiation of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, and B cell proliferation [125, 126] . It has been suggested that NO affects the polarised Th1-Th2 response, causing a Th2-biased immunoregulatory balance, via a relatively specific suppressive effect on Th1 subpopulations [122] [123] [124] . Such NO-induced immunomodulation occurs during virus infection in mice, as revealed by recent studies of HSV-1 and influenza virus infections [77, 127] , although such immunoregulatory effects of NO on the Th1-Th2 balance are commonly observed only with specific viruses, not all viruses [76, 78] . These biased Th2 responses are clearly demonstrated by using iNOS x/x mice, which show enhanced Th1 immune responses after virus infections [77, 127] . NO seems to downregulate the Th1-associated cytokine IFN-c, which is a major iNOS-inducing cytokine in virus infections as described above, and CTL responses as well, possibly through the suppression of IL-12 production [128] [129] [130] .",

            "text": "In noncytopathic virus infections CTLs, rather [125, 131] . However, some types of viruses such as influenza virus can be eradicated without the help of CTLs [132] . For influenza virus, a virus-specific Th1 response is more important for antiviral defence than are Th2 responses, because Th2 cells exacerbate pathological lung reactions in influenza pneumonia [133] . In this context, Karupiah et al. reported that NO impairs the anti-influenza virus response of the host by suppressing Th1-dependent IFN-c induction [77] . However, it has now been demonstrated that IFN-c, a Th1-dependent cytokine, is eventually inefficient in clearance of influenza virus from infectious foci [134] . Our recent experiments using iNOS x/x mice indicate that clearance of virus from lungs infected with either influenza virus or SeV is not affected by a lack of iNOS expression (Akaike et al., unpublished observation) [45] . In fact, iNOS x/x mice recuperate from viral pneumonia much better than do wild-type animals, because of reduced levels of oxidative stress in virus-infected tissues [45] . Therefore, not only NO-induced Th1 suppression but also NO-induced oxidative injury may be attributable to pathogenesis of infection with certain viruses that are resistant to the direct antiviral actions of NO. In addition, NO seems to have profound immunosuppressive and immunopathological effects, most typically in Mycobacterium avium and S. typhimurium infections [4, 135, 136] , which may be due to NO-induced cytotoxic effects on immune effector cells such as macrophages. Similar immunosuppression by NO is clearly demonstrated with vaccinia virus-infected murine macrophages, which show a loss of antiviral activity because of inhibition of IFN-a/b production by NO [80] .",

In many virus infections, iNOS expression appears to be regulated indirectly via interferon-c (IFN-c) induction, which depends on the Th1 response. The host's Th2 response, in contrast, downregulates iNOS induction. Direct iNOS induction may occur in some cases, such as with respiratory syncytial virus, HIV-1 (gp41), and viral replicative intermediate dsRNA.

Influenza infection in mice was produced by inhalation of 2rLD 50 of influenza A virus. The amount of NO generated in the lung with or without L-NMMA treatment was quantified by ESR spectroscopy (110 K) with (N-dithiocarboxy)sarcosine (DTCS)-Fe 2+ complex as a spin trap. L-NMMA (2 mg/mouse) was given i.p. to mice 2 h before ESR measurement. Data are meantSEM (n=4).

Such NO inhibition and lack of NO biosynthesis, however, significantly reduce the pathological consequences of various virus infections including viral pneumonia in mice caused by influenza virus, SeV and HSV-1; HSV-1-induced encephalitis in rats; EMCV-induced carditis and diabetes; and murine encephalitis induced by flavivirus (Murray Valley encephalitis virus; TBE-V)[43][44][45]77,[81][82][83][84][85]. It is thus conceivable that NO is not entirely an antiviral molecule, but it can be pathogenetic in various, if not all, virus infections.
