            "text": "Picornaviruses belong to an important group of animal pathogens that have evolved a specialized mechanism to promote translation initiation of their mRNAs internally [1]. This mechanism of translation initiation enables the preferential translation of their genome while avoiding the modification of translation initiation factors (eIFs) and other host factors that occur in infected cells 2, 3, 4 and induce the inactivation of host protein synthesis. The process of internal initiation of translation in eukaryotic mRNAs is dependent on a cis-acting element known as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that uses an internal codon in the mRNA to start protein synthesis. IRES elements were originally found in the genomes of picornaviruses, which are a family of positive strand RNA viruses 5, 6. IRES elements have also been found in a growing number of genetically distant viral RNAs, including flaviviruses, retroviruses, coronaviruses, dicistroviruses and plant RNA viruses, in addition to several cellular mRNAs that are translated under conditions when cap-dependent initiation is inhibited 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.",

The process of protein synthesis is initiated by the interaction of the 40S ribosomal subunit (bound to eIF3\u2013eIF2\u2013methionyl-tRNA) with the eIF4F complex (eIF4G\u2013eIF4A\u2013eIF4E), which in turn is bound to the 5\u2032 cap of the mRNA. This macromolecular complex then scans the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) to reach an AUG triplet in an appropriate context [16]. By contrast, IRES-dependent translation initiation recruits the translational machinery to an internal position in the mRNA, regardless of the presence of upstream AUG codons, stable RNA structure and protein-binding sites 1, 17.",

The 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA is covalently linked to viral protein g (VPg). All members of the different genera belonging to the picornavirus family initiate translation via an IRES element [17]. The success of the picornavirus replication cycle, and thus the effectiveness of infection, is dependent on the correct function of the IRES; the IRES region is therefore a target for antiviral drugs aiming to inactivate the IRES [18], and is a determinant of viral pathogenesis and virulence 19, 20, 21.",

In picornavirus RNAs the poly(A) tail together with the sequence of the 3\u2032 UTR, which is specific for each genus, constitute essential determinants of the virus multiplication cycle 32, 33, 34. The efficiency of viral RNA replication is enhanced by protein bridges that mediate RNA circularization by interacting with both ends of the viral RNA. In poliovirus RNAs the cloverleaf (CL) structure and the adjacent C-rich spacer interact with the host protein PCBP2 and the viral protein 3CD [35] generating a ternary complex that is essential for viral RNA replication, and that possibly regulates the switch from translation to replication [36].

Similarly, a functional link between the aphthovirus IRES and the 3\u2032 end of the viral RNA was suggested by the specific stimulation of IRES activity by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 3\u2032 UTR [39]. In agreement with data reported in other RNA viruses [40], the 3\u2032 end of the FMDV genome establishes strand-specific long range RNA\u2013RNA interactions, but in this case there are two different interactions, one with the IRES element and another with the S region at the 5\u2032 end [41] (Figure 1). Different RNA motifs seem to be involved in these interactions because a high-order structure adopted by the entire IRES and the 3\u2032 UTR was essential for RNA interaction, whereas the S region interacted with each of the stem-loops at the genome 3\u2032 end. The 3D structure of the FMDV 3\u2032 UTR is unknown; however in enteroviruses the 3\u2032 UTR is organized as two stem-loops that adopt a quasi globular organization [42].",

GNRA tetraloops are often involved in RNA folding, generating RNA tertiary contacts [61]. Sequence variability of the IRES region in FMDV field isolates shows substitutions in the GUAA sequence yielding GCAA or GCGA, always compatible with the GNRA consensus motif. Conversely, as shown by RNA probing, IRES residues involved in base pairing often show nucleotide covariation (Figure 2), strongly supporting the need for preserving IRES structure for internal initiation [54]. Site-directed nucleotide substitutions disrupting the FMDV GNRA motif led to the reorganization of the apical region of the central domain, demonstrating the significant role of this conserved motif in dictating the stability of the cruciform structure. Subsequent structural probing of GNRA mutants enabled the identification of a distant region (motif A) that became more susceptible to RNase attack [51]. Functional analysis of mutants in this region indicated a reduction in IRES activity similar to that reported for GUAG mutants. Conversely, RNA probing of the second-site substitutions showed that motif A mutants contained a reorganization that affected the mutated region and also the distant GNRA motif [62]. Based on the reciprocity of RNA structural changes this short region behaves as a receptor of the GNRA motif. Lack of genetic variability in this region in approximately one hundred FMDV sequences [63] showed a strong selective pressure for keeping the primary sequence. This feature can be explained either because of its involvement in distant contacts with other RNA motifs, or by recognition by auxiliary factors involved in translation initiation that remain to be identified.",

Along this line, RNA probing of the entire CVB3 5\u2032 NTR has shown that the previously known domains II to VII, defined by mutational and bioinformatic approaches, comprises a long-range tertiary interaction involving bases in domain II and domain V [60] that connects the 5\u2032 end (domain I, which folds in a CL structure) with the IRES element.

This observation suggested that IRES elements could share the property of having unique structural elements that mediate direct interaction with the 40S subunit. Accordingly, it has been speculated that the central domain of the aphthovirus and its structurally related cardiovirus IRES could have a fundamental role in dictating the formation of a stable tertiary structure, thereby providing the correct orientation to recruit the ribosome subunits to the initiation sites [62].",

            "text": "As mentioned previously, the IRES region constitutes a structural entity within the viral genome; this model is supported by the ability of IRES to fold in essentially the same manner, regardless of the downstream viral sequences that encompass the initiator codons, and fold as a stem-loop [66] (Figure 2). In the aphthovirus genome, two in-frame AUG triplets separated by 84 nucleotides are used as translation initiator codons of the viral polyprotein. The second functional triplet (AUG2) is used to initiate protein synthesis more frequently (80%) than AUG1 in infected cells, and also in cells transfected with chimeric RNAs 67, 68. A conserved A-rich sequence precedes AUG2 (Figure 2) and is engaged in base pair formation within a stem-loop phylogenetically conserved in FMDV field isolates. By contrast, the first functional start codon (AUG1) is located in a single-stranded region, as judged by its accessibility to chemicals and enzymes [66]. Initiation of protein synthesis from both AUGs is IRES-dependent but the mechanism operating in codon selection remains poorly understood. It has been proposed that following entry of the ribosome the initiation complex scans along this viral region until AUG2 is reached [68], or that the initiation complex is transferred to the vicinity of AUG2 [67]. Recently it was shown that translation initiation at AUG2 was barely abrogated by the presence of a modified, more stable RNA structure in the spacer sequence [66], consistent with previous observations of lack of effect of antisense molecules bound to AUG1 [67]. However, the factors required for reconstituting 48S initiation complexes at each initiation codon in vitro are different. In addition to eIF3, eIF4G and eIF4A, recognition of AUG1 is dependent on eIF1A, whereas initiation at AUG2 is dependent on eIF1 [66], suggesting that the mechanisms operating for selection of the initiation codon in FMDV depend on the sequence preceding the initiation triplet. This conclusion is in agreement with the observation that non-viral sequences adopting a stable hairpin structure placed in a spacer region between the IRES and the AUG of a reporter coding region abrogated translation initiation [69], but did not do so in the viral RNA 66, 67.",

Recent studies have taken advantage of reagents permeable to the cellular membrane that recognize RNA molecules in a structure-dependent manner to elucidate the organization of picornavirus IRES elements in living cells [52]. Notably, specific bases of the central domain in the FMDV IRES were differentially reactive towards dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in vivo than in vitro (Figure 2), demonstrating that the pattern of modification found in the cytoplasm of living cells differed from that obtained in vitro. In addition, new DMS-reactive bases specifically detected in vivo affected nucleotides involved in the formation of G:C base pairs in the secondary structure model generated in vitro. This result again suggests that the central region of the IRES adopts a different local RNA conformation in the cellular cytoplasm. Decreased attack of residues in the C-rich loop in vivo suggested a potential RNA\u2013protein interaction; this conserved motif is a candidate for interaction with PCBP [27]. Conversely, strong protection in the region upstream of the initiator codon suggested the formation of RNA\u2013protein complexes, which overlap the region described to interact with translation initiation factors in tissue culture cells 24, 71.",

The modification of RNA accessibility detected in the central domain in vivo could be because of different scenarios. The interaction with host transacting factors in the cellular cytoplasm could be responsible for this reorganization, as observed in vitro for other IRES elements [72]. Another possibility is the acquisition of a structural conformation that might facilitate a direct involvement of the apical region of the central domain with the ribosomal components. In support of this hypothesis, a tRNA-like structural motif that serves as substrate for RNase P in vitro resides in this IRES region [73]. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and both need further investigation because no 48S initiation complexes have been detected in the absence of eIFs and the corresponding IRES-dependent toe-prints are located downstream of the respective initiation codon [66] (Figure 2).",

As an example, the conservation of the pseudoknot motif \u2013 a characteristic feature of the HCV IRES \u2013 supports the possibility that the differences in RNA structure found among picornavirus IRES might have come about by horizontal transmission between different ancestors [50]. Another conserved feature of viral IRES is the presence of one or more polypyrimidine tracts 1, 48. However, a search of IRES elements on the basis of short conserved primary sequences (e.g. the polypyrimidine tract or the C-rich motifs that provide PTB or PCBP-binding sites, respectively) does not guarantee the presence of a functional element.

On the basis of the recognition by RNase P it was inferred that the HCV and pestivirus IRES contained a structural element that mimics the tRNA-like structure [75]. RNase P is a structure-dependent endonuclease involved in the processing of the tRNA precursor [76], which also recognizes RNA viruses containing tRNA-like structures at the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome as substrate [77]. The aphthovirus IRES contains a structural motif that acts as substrate for the RNase P ribozyme in vitro (Figure 2). The core structural element recognized by the ribozyme resides in the central domain of the FMDV IRES [73], overlapping with a self-folding region that contains the conserved motif GNRA, which is essential for IRES activity. As mentioned previously, the GNRA motif mediates the local RNA structure [51], presumably with the involvement of tertiary contacts. In support of the recognition of a structural element, defective FMDV IRES mutants with modified RNA structure responded differentially to ribozyme cleavage leading to an enhanced recognition that was accompanied by cleavage sites in nearby residues [73] as it also occurs in a variant RNA molecule of HCV [78]. As the viral cycle of picornaviruses and flaviviruses occurs in the cell cytoplasm, the viral RNA has no access to RNase P, which resides in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells [76].",

First, the differences in the relative position within the IRES and also within the genome of other distantly related viral RNAs 74, 77 could be the remnants of an ancestor module without function in the viral genome. Second, because overlapping information in the small genome of RNA viruses occurs often, it is also possible that this motif is involved in a new function still to be determined.

It can be envisaged that a tRNA-like motif within the picornavirus IRES could contribute to efficient recognition of the viral RNA by the translational machinery because it seems to occur in the dicistrovirus IGR 14, 80. However, to date there is no evidence of the formation of binary complexes mediated by the picornavirus IRES and 40S subunits in the absence of eIFs.

Picornavirus IRES elements seem to work as a ribonucleoprotein engine that assembles a large number of factors into a specialized, appropriately folded RNA structure that can be recognized by the ribosomal subunits. Other viral IRES elements seem to work as docking RNA structures that can gain access to specific sites in the ribosomal subunit without the help of additional factors. In between these divergent types of IRES elements, large variations in the mode of action exist that extend from picornavirus-like to the poorly understood cellular IRES elements. The idea that a universal IRES motif could consist of a structural element that mediates the interaction with the ribosomal machinery has gained support from studies using different approaches. In particular, structural and functional studies of the relatively small dicistrovirus IRES models have led to the idea that the IRES element itself mimics the initiator tRNA during internal initiation, in a process in which flexibility of the RNA molecule is crucial. Evaluating this model in the more complex, but also more efficient, picornavirus IRES elements represents a major challenge for the near future.",

(a) Upstream of the IRES element in the 5\u2032UTR of the aphthovirus genome (top), several structural elements are arranged consecutively: the S region, the poly(C) tract, the pseudoknotted region (PK), the cis-replicative element (cre). The poly(A) tail is located at the 3\u2032UTR. The grey circle at the 5\u2032 end depicts the viral protein VPg. Approximate nucleotide content of each region of the viral genome is indicated. The IRES region is enlarged from the aphthovirus genome (b). Position of IRES domains [2(H) to 5 (L)] is indicated at the bottom of the corresponding stem-loops. Interaction of specific sequences within domain 4 with initiation factor eIF4G is essential for IRES activity. eIF3, which is also required for IRES activity, shows preferential binding in domain 5. eIF4B-binding is restricted to the hairpin of domain 5 and moderately enhances IRES activity. The auxiliary protein PTB, which contributes to enhanced IRES activity, recognizes two separate polypyrimidine tracts, one in domain 2 and another in domain 5. The host factor PCBP interacts with the C-rich bulge in the central domain; its interaction is needed for entero- and rhinovirus IRES, but not for cardio- and aphthovirus IRES activity.",
