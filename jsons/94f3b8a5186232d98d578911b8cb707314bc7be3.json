Pharmacists globally are providing services amidst pandemic, including TRIAGE services, seeing patients and reducing the patients' burden on health care facilities such as hospitals and GP practices. Pharmacists are also working to providing home deliveries, as well as dealing with the increasing number of patients coming through to pharmacies with the other ailments. Pharmacy associations have issued their guidelines and in this editorial, several global examples of pharmacists' role in the COVID 19 are being discussed. Pakistan is used as a country case study in this editorial. The editorial also elaborates how pharmacists in the UK and Pakistan have teamed up together to compile 10-steps protection guidelines for the pharmacy teams in Pakistan in English and Urdu language. This 10-point guidance educates community pharmacies for safety and standard operation as the number of patients in the country continues to rise. These guidelines are endorsed by the government and private bodies. These can be adopted and adapted by any country; keeping in view their laws and regulations.",

Although, Pakistan as a fragile and indebted economy has come up to the rescue of its vulnerable people with a multi-trillion-rupee relief package, allocating 200 billion rupees for the labour class. Under the package, some 10 million people, categorized under low-income groups, will get a lump sum amount of 12,000 PKR, initially for a period of four months in the form of Ehsaas Emergency Cash Program [20] . However, this amount is lower than the daily wages they were getting before lockdown [19] . These economically pressured masses don't have much to spend on their health especially when the public hospitals have closed their OPDs for the general public. With no were to go and no money to spend, they access their nearby pharmacies which can get them medical advice without paying for consultation and they only have to pay for the medicine if it's needed.
