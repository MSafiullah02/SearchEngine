            "text": "In the late twentieth century, substantial reductions in child mortality occurred in low- and middle-income countries. The fall in child deaths during 1960\u201390 averaged 2.5% per year and the risk of dying in the first 5 years of life halved \u2013 a major achievement in child survival. In the period 1990\u20132001, the rate of mortality reduction averaged 1.1% annually, mostly after the neonatal period. Most neonatal deaths are unrecorded in formal registration systems and communities with most neonatal deaths have the least information related to mortality rates and interventions. Not surprisingly, therefore, current global burden figures of newborn and young infant deaths are largely estimates. These figures suggest that 10.6 million children under 5 years die annually and of the 130 million births, 3.8 million die in the first 4 weeks of life \u2013 the neonatal period, with three-quarters of neonatal deaths occurring in the first week after birth. The south-East Asian region accounts for the highest number of child deaths (3 million), whereas the highest mortality rates are seen in sub-Saharan Africa. Annually, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia share 41% and 34% of child deaths, respectively (Table 1\n). Surprisingly, only six countries account for half of worldwide deaths and 42 for 90% of child deaths. The predominant causes are pneumonia, diarrhea, and neonatal disorders with additional contribution from malaria and AIDS (see Table 2, Table 3\nfor details). In all, 99% of neonatal deaths occur in poor countries (estimated average neonatal mortality rate (NMR) of 33/1000 live births), while the remainder occur in 39 high-income countries (estimated NMR of 4/1000 live births).",

The major social determinants affecting the under 5 years' mortality and morbidity include poverty, malnutrition, inequity, lack of education, failure to implement the breast-feeding and complementary feeding programs, the presence of debilitating disease in addition to infections, complications of labor and low birth weight, and inadequate health-related social behaviors and practices and other social and cultural determinants of health.

The situation is further compounded by increasing antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of newer infections with viruses such as avian influenza (H5N1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Although the contribution of neonatal infections to overall child mortality has only recently been recognized, the persistent global burden of deaths due to diarrhea and pneumonia underscores the need for improved public health strategies for change. We have interventions that can make a difference (Table 17\n) to childhood infectious diseases. What is needed is their implementation at scale to populations at greatest risk. This will require not only biomedical approaches but measures to address the social determinants of disease.",
