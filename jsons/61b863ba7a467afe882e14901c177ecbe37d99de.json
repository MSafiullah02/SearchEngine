In this study, we aimed to assess the imaging characteristics and risk factors associated with adverse composite endpoints in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 24 designated hospitals in Jiangsu province, China, between 10 January and 18 February 2020. Clinical and initial CT findings at admission were extracted from medical records. Patients aged < 18 years or without available clinical or CT records were excluded. The composite endpoints were admission to ICU, acute respiratory failure occurrence, or shock during hospitalization. The volume, density, and location of lesions, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation, were quantitatively analyzed in each patient. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors among age and CT parameters associated with the composite endpoints. Results: In this study, 625 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled; among them, 179 patients without an initial CT at admission and 25 patients aged < 18 years old were excluded and 421 patients were included in analysis. The median age was 48.0 years and the male proportion was 53% (224/421). During the follow-up period, 64 (15%) patients had a composite endpoint. There was an association of older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.06; P = 0.003), larger consolidation lesions in the upper lung (Right: OR, 1.13; 95%CI: 1.03-1.25, P =0.01; Left: OR,1.15; 95%CI: 1.01-1.32; P = 0.04) with increased odds of adverse endpoints. Conclusion: There was an association of older age and larger consolidation in upper lungs on admission with higher odds of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.",

And based on a large population, the results and conclusions may be considered specific and robust to patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice. Consolidation in upper lungs on initial CT at admission were risk factors associated with adverse endpoints after adjusting for age. Firstly, more consolidation has been reported in patients died from COVID-19 [5] . Histological examinations of lung biopsy samples from patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with proteinaceous and fibrous exudates, which attributed to imaging appearance on chest CT [20, 21] . In patients with unfavorable outcome, consolidation development accelerated, which happened in all lobes, especially in the upper lungs. Secondly, in terms of distribution, the upper lung played an important role in risk evaluation for COVID-19 patients. Previous studies reported worse symptoms related to more pulmonary lesions [10, 13, 15, 23] . However, no detailed distribution information was described. Our study of 421 COVID-19 patients suggested an increased pulmonary lesion in bilateral upper lungs were independent risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes, which as far as we know, has not been reported. This finding is of significant clinical implications, not only in providing us a simpler way to identify high risk patients on CT, but also has potential to extend to chest radiographs, where upper lobe consolidations are easy to be perceived.

AI played a significant role in this study and showed potential in COVID-19 diagnosis and patient monitoring. Based on high accuracy of lung and lesion segmentation from AI system, we measured the precise volume of opacities with different components, multiple HU blocks and location respectively. This method is superior to those studies based on visual evaluation [22] [23] [24] which may vary from person to person. The accuracy of lesion extraction is critical for risk factor identification in multivariate regression in our study. Moreover, the process of segmentation by AI only takes few minutes per patient making large scale quantification analysis possible.",

Third, we assessed quantitative CT characteristics; however, we did not extract high-throughput imaging features, including histogram and texture.

The finding provided us a simpler way to identify high risk patients on CT that the elder with large consolidation in upper lungs should be paid more attention during the treatment of COVID-19. Initial CT evaluation and identification of these risk factors could be helpful toward the monitoring of COVID-19.",
