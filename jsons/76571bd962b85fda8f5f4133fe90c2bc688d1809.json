The sensitivity analysis for the endemic threshold (4) tells us how important each parameter is to disease transmission. This information is crucial not only for experimental design, but also to data assimilation and reduction of complex models [16] . Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values, since there are usually errors in collected data and presumed parameter values. It is used to discover parameters that have a high impact on the threshold R 0 and should be targeted by intervention strategies. More accurately, sensitivity indices' allows us to measure the relative change in a variable when a parameter changes. For that purpose, we use the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable with respect to a given parameter, which is defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter. If such variable is differentiable with respect to the parameter, then the sensitivity index is defined as follows.",
