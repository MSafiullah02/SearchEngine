The muscular layers grind food into smaller particles and move it forward into the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter. Of equal importance are the glandular portions of the stomach, which include parietal cells (for secretion of hydrochloric acid), chief cells (for secretion of pepsinogen), and mucus-producing cells (which also secrete bicarbonate). Normally, the gastric mucosal barrier keeps hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes within the lumen and prevents loss of plasma constituents into the stomach.2 Once the food particles are ground into small enough components, they pass through the pyloric sphincter into the beginning of the small intestine, known as the duodenum.\n",

The mucosa along the length of the small intestine is formed into villi, which are fingerlike projections into the intestinal lumen that enlarge the surface of the small intestine. Microvilli then form the \u201cbrush border\u201d to further increase the surface area available for digestion and absorption of nutrients. Enzymes within the brush border aid in digestion of larger food molecules into smaller, more readily absorbable particles. Absorption may occur via specific transport mechanisms or by pinocytosis. The epithelial cells also are involved with absorption and secretion of electrolytes and water.3 Enterocytes are connected to each other by tight junctions, limiting absorption between cells, as well as preventing backflow of nutrients from the interstitium into the intestinal lumen. The enterocytes start at the crypt (base of the villus) and migrate toward the intestinal lumen where they are shed, with a lifespan of approximately 2 to 5 days. A healthy, intact mucosal lining is important for the integrity of the intestine. Any type of inflammation that disrupts this layer can lead to significant intestinal disease.4 The gastrointestinal (GI) tract absorbs approximately 99% of the fluid presented to it; therefore any damage can cause significant alterations in acid-base and fluid balances.5, 5a\n",

With emerging and improved diagnostic techniques such as ELISA and PCR testing, newer recommendations for definitive diagnosis rely on a multimodal evaluation for some of these organisms.11 Evidence does support the role of Clostridium spp. in gastroenteritis.8, 9, 12 However, because many dogs have C. perfringens and its CPE toxin in their GI tracts without developing clinical signs, evaluation of the roles of these organisms, as well as those of Campylobacter and Helicobacter spp. in GI disease of companion animals, is ongoing.13\n",

However, the proteins lost into the intestinal tract can include large proteins such as albumin and antithrombin, both of which have important roles in homeostasis. Albumin, with a molecular weight of 69,000 daltons, contributes significantly to oncotic pressure. Loss of albumin through the GI tract can lead to a reduced colloid osmotic pressure and subsequent loss of fluid from the intravascular space. Although this is typically a gradual process, it can cause significant changes in the compartmentalization of fluids in some patients. If third spacing has occurred, it may be necessary to use colloidal fluids such as hydroxyethyl starch or human albumin, in addition to crystalloids, to prevent further intravascular fluid losses (see Chapter 58).22Albumin also has additional beneficial effects, such as its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.23\n",

Endoscopy is a noninvasive method for visualizing the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa, as well as for obtaining small (1.8- to 2.4-mm) biopsy samples. Disadvantages of this method are that the samples are small and biopsies cannot be obtained distal to the duodenum. Ileal samples can be obtained if colonoscopy is performed, but this requires patient preparation (i.e., administration of cleansing enemas), which can cause decompensation in unstable animals resulting from fluid and electrolyte shifts. Another method for obtaining samples is via exploratory laparotomy. This is an excellent method for acquiring full-thickness biopsy samples of multiple areas of the GI tract (and other organs if they are found to be abnormal). The disadvantages are that it is much more invasive, and poor wound healing may be a concern in patients with reduced albumin levels. This has been reported in human surgical patients as well as canine surgical patients.24, 25, 26 In addition, diseased gastric and intestinal walls may heal poorly. Laparoscopy is another technique that can be used to obtain excellent visualization of the abdominal cavity along with full-thickness biopsies of the GI tract (and other organs as needed). Laparoscopy is less invasive than exploratory laparotomy and may be associated with less morbidity because of smaller incisions; however, healing of gastric and intestinal biopsy sites would remain a concern in patients with low albumin levels or diseased walls.",
