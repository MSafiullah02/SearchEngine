The pathogenicity of the MUS-WL FHMNV strain was determined by experimentally infecting naive juvenile Muskellunge through intraperitoneal injection with two viral concentrations (63 and 6.3 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 / fish). Both doses resulted in 100% mortality in experimentally infected fish, which exhibited severely pale gills and petechial hemorrhaging in eyes, fins, and skin. Histopathological alterations in experimentally infected fish were observed mainly in the hematopoietic tissues in the form of focal areas of necrosis.

In the case of WRSFH fish, this is the first time that FHMNV has been isolated from Muskellunge exhibiting clinical signs and experiencing mortality. Upon experimental infection, both low and high doses of the MUS-WL FHMNV strain caused morbidity, 100% mortality, and histopathological changes in tissues of all exposed fish, thereby fulfilling River's postulate that FHMNV is pathogenic to Muskellunge. This finding underscores the importance of determining the host range of this emerging virus and the potential risk it may pose to the Muskellunge conservation and enhancement programs in multiple U.S. states and Canada. That the MUS-WL FHMNV strain was not associated with morbidity or mortality at the time of collection can be attributed to one of multiple factors such as the fish were early in the incubation phase or that older fish may be less susceptible to infection with this virus. Upon experimental infection, the virus was isolated from internal organs suggesting, as was demonstrated in the case of Fathead Minnows, the infection is also systemic in Muskellunge. Since experimental infection in this study was performed by i.p. injection, it is currently unknown how the virus is transmitted under natural conditions (e.g., cohabitation with or ingestion of infected fish). Regardless of the route of infection (natural or by injection), it is clear that FHMNV can cause significant necrotic changes in hematopoietic tissues in multiple organs such as liver, kidneys, and spleen, a matter that may affect the ability of resident white blood cells to mount potent immune responses (Bromage et al. 2004; Ma et al. 2013) . The studies of Iwanowicz and Goodwin (2002) described similar lesions in the liver, kidneys, and spleen of experimentally infected Fathead Minnows. There are currently no data available on cells or tissues targeted by the other bafiniviruses; the WBV was isolated from the White Bream Blicca bjoerkna (Order Cypriniformes) in 2001 during a wild fish disease survey and its pathogenicity has never been ascertained (Sch\u00fctze et al. 2006) .

Additionally, the finding that MUS-WR appeared as a paraphyletic taxon to the isolates obtained from Fathead Minnows (FHMNV-181 and GU002364) with a low level of node support indicates MUS-WR is more closely related to the FHMNV isolates obtained from Fathead Minnows than to the MUS-WL strain.

For example, phylogenetic analysis studies performed on 29 isolates of the human coronavirus OC43-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) demonstrated the presence of at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, most likely arising from recombination (Lau et al. 2011) . By analogy, it is currently unknown whether the MUS-WL strain has mutated from another strain of FHMNV or vice versa. It is also unknown whether MUS-WL or MUS-WR FHMNV strains are associated with Muskellunge only; however, it is unlikely that the infection in WRH Muskellunge originated from WLSFH since both FHMNV strains have some nucleotide and amino acid differences from one another. Molecular diagnostic assays that are able to identify viruses are valuable tools for cost-effective surveillance studies as well as for preliminary detection during outbreaks. Others have developed primer sets that target a seemingly conserved region of the spike glycoprotein to specifically detect FHMNV (Batts et al. 2012 ). In the current study, we developed an additional one-step RT-PCR that allows for the specific detection of FHMNV. The primers target a large portion of the helicase gene, a gene that plays a critical role in nidovirus replication, transcription, and virion morphogenesis (van Dinten et al. 2000; Seybert et al. 2005) .
