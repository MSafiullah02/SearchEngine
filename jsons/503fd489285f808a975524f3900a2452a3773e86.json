            "text": "This chapter examines the generation of Tokyo's division over time by focusing on the changes in national and municipal policies on urban planning, land use, and housing, as well as the outcomes of these long-term trajectories since the 1950s onward. By comparing with the Western urban discourse, we clarify the process of how Tokyo became divided in terms of residential conditions. The national government focused on the growth of major metropolitan areas, stimulating suburban development and homeownership in the suburbs from the 1950s to the 1980s. However, after the late 1990s, the target shifted from the suburbs to the city centers. Alongside global competition among cities, the long-term recession of the Japanese economy, and social changes, continuous investment to grow central Tokyo has increased in importance. In contrast, suburban neighborhoods are facing challenges related to an aging population and an increase in housing vacancies. Although government intervention is necessary, there are limited possibilities for the outer suburbs to revitalize and re-grow. The sharp contrast between the growth in city centers and the shrinking suburbs, and specifically the divided Tokyo, will become more obvious in the next decade.",

In addition, globalization has accelerated competition among cities, and many municipal governments have moved toward entrepreneurialism (Gonzalez 2018) . This move has been followed by real estate developers building multi-functional condominiums in city centers, targeting single women, high-income couples, urban elites, and the creative classes (Florida 2002; Kern 2010; Koizumi et al. 2011; Kubo and Yui 2011a; Scott 2019) .",

            "text": "The fact of inter-urban competition and urban entrepreneurialism has opened up the urban space of the advanced capitalist countries to all kinds of new patterns of development, even when the net effect has been the serial reproduction of science parks, gentrification, world trading centers, cultural and entertainment centers, large-scale interior shopping malls with postmodern accouterments, and the like. The emphasis on the production of a good local business climate has emphasised the importance of the locality as a site of regulation of infrastructural position, labour relations, environmental controls, and even tax policy vis-\u00e0-vis international capital. (Harvey 1989, p. 11) To succeed in the face of global and domestic competition, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government adopted a policy of entrepreneurialism (promoting the \"new patterns of development\" mentioned in the above quote) beginning in the first decade of the twenty-first century (Boland 2007; Gonzalez 2018; Jacobs 2005) . This policy shift not only increased the number of urban condominium developments (Kubo and Yui 2011a ) and encouraged population recovery (Miyazawa and Abe 2005; Yabe 2003 ) but also intensified the growth of inequality within the Tokyo metropolitan area (Hirayama 2005; Jacobs 2005) . Urban growth in central Tokyo and shrinkage in the suburbs became obvious (Kubo 2015) , and the emergence of \"hot and cold spots\" divided the city, even in central Tokyo, because entrepreneurial urban policies exacerbated the unevenness of urban development (Smith 1990; Hirayama 2005) . The neo-liberal national policies that stimulated urban renewal through the deregulation of urban planning, building standards, and the housing market (e.g., the Urban Renaissance Special Measure Law of 2002) strongly supported the re-growth of central Tokyo from the beginning of the twenty-first century onward. For instance, the deregulation of the floor-space ratio enabled super high-rise buildings in commercial and industrial areas in central Tokyo, offering bonus floor space to projects providing vacant public spaces that could serve as evacuation sites in natural disasters or other emergencies (Kubo 2014; Abe et al. 2018) . New-build gentrification, ranging from the development of vacant commercial, industrial, or reclaimed land to super high-rise buildings, has transformed central Tokyo's landscape since the beginning of the twenty-first century (Lutzeler 2008) . Additionally, many areas surrounding train stations and airports offered large tracts of vacant land that was well-suited to huge urban renewal projects. With the facilitating influence of municipal policies, these areas were targeted for new urban development in Tokyo and other large Japanese cities.",

In this chapter, we examine how urban and housing policies have affected urban spatial structures, caused a divide between the city center and the suburbs, and transformed the urban lifestyle in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Starting with a chronicle of urban policies in Japan, we review the post-war housing policies that stimulated suburban homeownership and the horizontal expansion of the Tokyo metropolitan area. Then, the recent spatial restructuring accompanying the emergence of urban governance under globalization is examined. We focus on the housing market from the beginning of the twenty-first century onward and on aviation governance. Through globalization, transit hubs such as airports have gradually become centers of urban development projects, known as transit-oriented development. Focusing on aviation governance as a case study helps to clarify the spatial restructuring that has occurred in recent decades in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The discussion is positioned within the context of the transformation of the spatial structure of the Tokyo metropolitan area in modern times.",

            "text": "Most differences between housing patterns in Japan and those in Western cities are a result of the unique family system and household ownership trends in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Japan. After the Meiji Restoration in the 1870s, which opened Japan to new influences and industrial progress, a civil law was passed establishing, that is, ie-seido (the family institution). Japan had had a long history as a feudal society in which traditional lords and families owned most of the land and houses. However, this new law passed in the late Meiji era categorized people by family unit or parentage and allowed them to select their jobs and place of residence. The law also allowed people to own real estates, such as houses and land if desired, although the family patriarch made decisions regarding the latter. Therefore, the history of land and house ownership by individuals in Japan is relatively short. Even as recently as 1941, the homeownership rate was only 22% in major Japanese cities (Ronald 2008) . Importantly, family members did not share equally in the family's property. Patriarchs held majority control and transferred their properties to their eldest sons, who traditionally continued to look after their parents in the family home. As a result, the other sons and the daughters left the original family and formed new families through marriage. This meant that the younger sons (i.e., the male heads of the new families) needed to find jobs in other areas, which led to residential mobility from rural areas to the growing, densely populated urban zones. Thus, the housing custom based on the patriarchal family institution, which was supported by the ideology that homeownership should be dominated by men, was legally codified in Japan (Ronald 2004 ). Because few women had paying jobs, they lived with their parents until marriage. A few exceptions were found in metropolitan centers such as Tokyo and Osaka. For example, in Tokyo, rental apartments for working women were built by Dojunkai, a government institution for housing development established for the purpose of urban reconstruction after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Kageyama 2004). In general, however, there were few possibilities for women to own houses or to overcome the patrimony that was dominant during this period.",

For example, even in the 1990s, more than 30% of couples who had been married for more than 10 years lived with one of the spouses' parents (Kato 2003) .

            "text": "The suburbanization of modern Japanese cities started at the beginning of the twentieth century, when Western urban planning methods such as the development of \"garden cities\" were adopted. In 1907, volunteers from the Regional Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs of Japan published a book entitled \"Den'en Toshi\" which literally translates as \"Garden City.\" As the depleted condition of land in rural areas had become a serious issue, the Japanese government developed energetic campaigns to improve rural infrastructure. Connecting the conveniences of urban areas with rural amenities as garden city developments were intended to do was considered an attractive method for improving the rural environment. Little attention was paid to the notion that these areas should be self-sufficient or to the conception that workplaces are to be located near residential areas. The main concern was how to create a good residential environment for urban and rural settlements (Suzuki 2000) . In Japan, the Garden City Movement was started in Osaka in 1910 by Kobayashi Ichizo, a powerful entrepreneur who founded the Hankyu Toho Group. The main developers were private railway companies aiming to attract potential residents along their rail lines. For example, in 1931, Kansai Tochi Inc. launched a plan to build Ohmino Den'en Toshi in Sakai City, Osaka. The plan focused on a very large area (approximately 11.65 ha) near the Kita-Noda Station of the Nankai Electric Railway Koya Line, and it clearly displayed the typical landscape of a garden city, with radiating roads extending from a central roundabout. Although the planners had visited Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City in the United Kingdom to study them, they were mostly interested in these cities' landscapes and in determining how to provide better, well-planned residential environments outside large cities. These interests were prioritized over adopting the maintenance and management systems, theory, or concepts such as providing rental housing for the working classaspects that were central to the garden city idea (Kikuchi 2004) .",

The plan was implemented in the Senzoku, O'okayama, and Tamagawa areas of Tokyo suburbs by Den'en Toshi Company Ltd. (\"Garden City Company\"), a direct predecessor of the Tokyu Railroad Company and its related businesses. It was built by Shibusawa Hideo, the son of Shibusawa Eiichi, a powerful entrepreneur in the late nineteenth century who consulted for the company. The company obtained 125-148 ha of land on which to build their envisioned utopia. The Senzoku area was first to be developed in 1922, followed by Tamagawa-dai and O'okayama beginning in 1923. Particularly in Tamagawa-dai (now called Den'en Chofu), the design of the landscape was strongly influenced by Sir Ebenezer Howard's garden city concept, comprising a concentric structure with radial roads extending from a main station. Similar developments emerged in the Nagoya metropolitan area, where municipal planners adopted the idea of \"San-rin Toshi\" (literally meaning \"Forest City\"), constructing hillside developments in the Yagoto area (Hotta 1995). These planners paid great attention to retaining the natural landscape and the inclination of the hillside when building roads and in other types of land use.",

In contrast, a large part of central Tokyo had been destroyed in the earthquake and the fire that followed because its reclaimed lowland was filled with high-density wooden apartments. In the 1930s and 1940s, undeveloped open land on the Musashino Terrace welcomed large housing developments, defense industry construction (e.g., Nakajima Aircraft Industry Ltd.'s Musashino Factory), and company housing for employees. Today, these modern suburban development areas are considered a part of the center of the Tokyo metropolitan area. Post-war suburban residential developments have expanded beyond prefectural boundaries alongside the popularization of a caroriented lifestyle. These changes have been supported by national policies aimed at stimulating suburban/urban development, for example, by constructing highways and reclaiming land for large-scale developments. This is discussed in depth in the following sections.",

For instance, a spatial plan based on the Comprehensive National Land Development Act of 1950 determined development measures in Japan. This Act was characterized by a hierarchical framework comprising national, regional, and prefectural levels of administration. In the 1950s, the most urgent issue that housing policies had to address was the housing shortage after the war. The national government established major housing policies for this purpose. For example, the Japanese Housing Finance Agency was set up in 1950 to finance homeownership by high-income families. Following this, the Japan Housing Corporation began developing housing complexes in 1955 and later developed huge housing estates in the suburbs to supply affordable housing for middle-income people. The government also built social housing for less affluent families (Japan Federation of Housing Organizations 2002; Kageyama 2004).",

The result was that Tokyo emerged as the clear winner, followed by Osaka and Nagoya. This led to the creation of the Tokaido megalopolis and turned other areas into shrinking regions (Abe et al. 2018) . One example is the change in procedures regarding social housing, which from the 1950 to the 1960s was preferred by young married couples who wanted to save money to buy their own homes in the near future. They tended to spend the years when their income was relatively low dreaming of climbing the housing ladder leading to homeownership. Later, because the income restriction became stricter over time, social housing came to accommodate mainly low-income households, single-parent families, and single older adults (Hayakawa 1997; Yui 1993 Yui , 1996 .",

Consequently, the closure of central shopping streets and the aging of shop owners accelerated the process of decline. Gradually, an empty space expanded in many Japanese cities (Shinohara 2011) . In major metropolitan areas, suburbanization led to population loss in the city centers. To deal with this problem, the national government passed the Urban Renaissance Special Measure Law in 2002, a neo-liberal spatial policy promoting deregulation in urban planning, land use, and housing supply. Through city center redevelopment, governments expected to overcome the long-term economic recession and stimulate rebuilding projects to increase the number of disaster-proof buildings (Abe et al. 2018 ). This policy strengthened the power of central Tokyo and facilitated recovery in terms of both population and economic activity in the first decade of the twentyfirst century (Koizumi et al. 2011; Miyazawa and Abe 2005; Yabe 2003 ). By the next decade, the spatial divide between the growth in the city centers and the lower levels of investment and greater aging in the suburbs became inevitable (Hirayama 2005; Kubo 2015; Kubo et al. 2017; Yui et al. 2016 Yui et al. , 2017 ; see also Chaps. 3, 4, and 6).",

Figure 2 .2 shows the rapid growth of condominium developments and the decline in the average price of condominiums in Tokyo during this period. In these years, many potential homeowners were the children of post-war baby boomers and had grown up in metropolitan suburbs. Because their parents had owned real estate in major metropolitan areas, this group of potential homeowners tended to have preferences regarding lifestyle and the family-housing 1 The neighborhood lifecycle is one of the classical urban ecology models of American cities. Neighborhoods are transformed over time through the following stages (Hoover and Vernon 1959): (1) development; (2) expansion through intervention and the transition of specific neighborhood characteristics in terms of housing and residents into surrounding areas; (3) stagnation and shrinkage of neighborhoods as a result of the deterioration of buildings and filtering-down effects, inadequate maintenance, and insufficient investment caused by a lack of access to financial resources; and (4) renewal involving demolition and/or redevelopment via either public or private investments. The ability of residents or communities to access financial resources at various points in this cycle has led to the decline and (re)growth of neighborhoods in the United States, which has also been strongly affected by federal and state policies (Metzger 2000) . relationship that differed from those of their parents. They preferred living in condominiums in the city center over moving to the suburbs to purchase a home. The growth in the number of condominiums has facilitated this new lifestyle trend. Condominiums attract single women in their 30s and 40s with significant purchasing power who previously lacked alternatives that would satisfy their need for high-quality housing (see also Chap. 4). The upsurge in the number of condominiums in central Tokyo was strongly affected by neo-liberal housing policies introduced in the 1990s, such as deregulation of urban developments, the mortgage market, and building standards, which encouraged urban development projects. Kubo (2014) has noted that this deregulation of the mortgage market strengthened the diversification of long-term housing loans by private banks and public institutions, on which most first-time homeowners depend. For example, before 2005, the Japan Housing Finance Agency (formerly the Government Housing Loan Corporation) provided long-term, low-interest housing loans called \"Flat 35,\" which had an average annual interest rate of less than 3.0%. Other private finance agencies providing long-term housing loans for middle-class homeowners followed the interest rates set by the Japan Housing Finance Agency. Beginning in 2006, the Japan Housing Finance Agency's interest rate gradually rose, but other private finance agencies continued to provide long-term housing loans at lower rates. Thus, potential homeowners were easily able to purchase a home by selecting one of these long-term, low-interest loans (Kubo 2014) .",

Since the 1960s, the Japanese government has promoted rebuilding and providing parks and wide roads for disaster prevention, and deregulating the floor-space ratio was the simplest way to achieve this. The Total Design System of 1970, for example, specified that a floor-space ratio bonus would be provided for development plans involving a certain amount of vacant land. After 1990, the Japanese government accelerated these deregulation processes, including the relaxation of floor-space ratios, enabling the construction of super high-rise buildings in central Tokyo. Currently, developers can apply for floor-space ratio bonuses if their projects include vacant public spaces that can serve as evacuation sites during emergencies. As mentioned above, the population in central Tokyo declined through the early 1990s. However, the deregulation of the floor-space ratio facilitated the construction of super high-rise residential buildings, enabling potential homeowners to purchase condominiums and increasing the popularity of living in the city center. As a result, population recovery was seen in central Tokyo from the beginning of the twenty-first century.",

The challenge of hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020 and the rise of East Asian cities in the global economy pushed the national and municipal governments in a neo-liberal and entrepreneurial direction after the first decade of the twenty-first century (Gonzalez 2017) . The municipal government initiated transit-oriented development to enable better access within Tokyo and to increase passenger traffic. Reflecting municipal policies, private transportation companies, such as the East Japan Railway Company, Tokyo Metro, and Japan Airport Terminal Co. Ltd., launched several renewal, improvement, and new development projects on their properties (see, e.g., East Japan Railway Company 2018). Regarding the domestic urban political context, here, we focus on the processes of deregulation and privatization of airport logistics and related businesses in Japan. Traditionally, after the 1980s, the national government owned and operated Japanese airports, the public sector dominated the logistics of the airport business, and the private sector managed related facilities at airports. This unique system resulted in higher landing fees, especially at Haneda Airport, and inefficiency in airport operations (The Council of the Growth Strategy of MLIT 2010). Along with the long-term economic recession in Japan since the 1990s, neo-liberal policy deregulating and privatizing public-owned services has been the key in maintaining Tokyo's competitiveness. As the population in most Japanese cities started to shrink and economic conditions worsened after the first decade of the twenty-first century (Kubo and Mashita 2019) , maintaining Tokyo's strength was expected to contribute to the recovery of the Japanese economy.",

First, during the post-war reconstruction period, the Japanese government established airport systems through public funding and government leadership to stimulate the development of the airport industry in Japan (from the 1950 to the 1970s). Second, along with the establishment of the domestic airport system through public initiatives, the government promoted aviation liberalization in the 1980s and 1990s. Finally, drastic changes occurred in aviation governance beginning at the start of the twenty-first century, compared with the situation when the airport industry was established.",

In 1966, the national government selected Narita City in Chiba Prefecture as a possible site for this airport (Narita International Airport Corporation 2019), but this was strongly protested by local farmers. Later, radical activist groups joined the protests, resulting in a series of terrorist attacks, multiple deaths (including suicides in the aftermath of these attacks), and numerous injuries during the 1960s through the early 1980s. Meanwhile, the demand for air transport continued to exceed the capacity of Haneda Airport, which was problematic. Opening a new airport became an urgent priority for the government, which took political action to obtain land through eminent domain for the construction of a new airport in 1970. This fueled even more vigorous protests. After several postponements, Narita Airport was finally opened in 1978 (NAA 2016).",

This project aims to utilize airport areas for the development of retail, business, and entertainment facilities, while also maintaining parks and recreation facilities for residents. The re-internationalization of Haneda Airport and the opening of Ibaraki Airport both occurred in 2010, enabling better access between central Tokyo and major transportation hubs (Tanaka 2010).",

This was partially because Narita Airport's popularity rapidly declined following the re-internationalization of Haneda Airport because of Narita's distance from central Tokyo (see Fig. 2 .3). The MLIT launched the \"Visit Japan\" campaign in the first decade of the twenty-first century to stimulate inbound tourism to Japan, and international airports were expected to play dual roles of both nodes and destinations for inbound tourism. In the Narita region, the increase in Asian tourists in the first decade of the twenty-first century fueled the development of urban tourism in Narita City. Hotels offered free shuttlebus services connecting the airport, hotels, the Narita train station, shopping malls, and the old temple town. Meanwhile, Narita City published tourist guides in several languages and developed an English-language website providing information for tourists, and many restaurants and local shops in the old temple town and shopping malls prepared multilingual menus or brochures to welcome international tourists (Suzuki et al. 2010) .",

Haneda, as the most important hub with the best access to central Tokyo, offers diverse urban functions both in the airport buildings and in the surrounding zones. With a similar level of urban development, Narita serves as a node connecting several tourist attractions in the region, and Ibaraki supplements the other airports' operation by addressing the need for low-cost carriers and private charter flights. Figure 2 .4 shows a comparison of the functions of these three airports, each of which plays a different role and fulfills different urban development functions. Haneda represents vertical, transit-oriented development, along with the central city revival trend in Tokyo. Narita is characterized by horizontal and network-based urban development, and Ibaraki exemplifies the traditional location of airport developments, isolated from residential areas and having less effect on nearby regions. In the age of globalization and neo-liberalization, the three airports in the Tokyo metropolitan area play complementary roles in forming a unique spatial structure in terms of urban development. The chronology and chorology of aviation governance at each airport, evident in changes in policies, urban development trends, the socioeconomic context, and human behavior, have led to these differences among the three airports.",

Figure 2 .5 provides an overview of the Tokyo's transformations in spatial structure and their driving forces over the centuries. We focus on the economy, urbanism, development, and transportation as driving forces. From the 1950s to today, Tokyo's city regions have expanded west of the Musashino Terrace. The city regions formed a conurbation along with the development of the factory system, which Scott (2019) has termed \"the first wave of capitalism.\" The government and businesspersons such as Shibusawa Eiichi established the modern railroad system, and entrepreneurs applied Western urban planning methods in Japan. Factories and housing for employees supported the expansion of city regions west of Tokyo. Suburban development then gradually expanded to the north and the east. The ecological model of the urbanization process, 3 which focuses 3 The ecological model of the urbanization process was established by the Chicago school and its followers. The most well-known variations of this approach are the concentric zone model (Burgess 1925 ), the sector model (Hoyt 1939) , and the multiple nuclei model (Harris and Ullman 1945) . Abe (2003) examined early studies in the field of Japanese urban geography by Kiuchi (1941 Kiuchi ( , 1951 and Tanabe (1971) , which attempted to apply these models to Japanese cities. Yui (1999) reviewed late twentieth century Western studies on housing and urban residential patterns (Johnston 1984; Knox and Pinch 2000; Robson 1975) and concluded that each of these Western models assumed urban residential segregation in terms of income, race, and class. Therefore, we cannot directly apply these models to Japanese cities where these forms of residential segregation do not exist, there may be less ethnic diversity, and housing market conditions and family structures differ from those that Spatial structure Urbanism / Transportation / Development",

Government intervention in urban development, transportation, and the housing market led to suburban homeownership becoming more popular. To supply this type of housing to the growing middle class, suburban development expanded beyond prefectural boundaries, reaching a 100 km commuter belt at the peak of suburbanization and integrating prefectural centers such as Mito City into the Tokyo metropolitan area (see also Chap. 3). In addition, there has been a suburban relocation of some previously urban functions such as research institutions (e.g., Tsukuba Science City) and industrial production facilities requiring proximity to transportation systems (e.g., ports, highway interchanges, or airports). A new airport was established, and the complementary roles played by Haneda and Narita airports supported Tokyo's growth. Suburban mixed-use developments such as Makuhari New City were built by the national and municipal governments within a 30 km commuter belt around central Tokyo. The suburbs within a 30-70 km commuter belt became the focus of housing estate developments targeting the middle classes in the Tokyo metropolitan area.",

A focus on urban redevelopment and the consequent population growth in the city center have fueled this trend over the past two decades. In this context, suburban neighborhoods face challenges related to aging populations and increases in vacant housing. Although government intervention is necessary, there are limited possibilities for the outer suburbs in terms of revitalization and growth.
