The phenotype\u2019s differing presentations are based on viral load timing, comorbidities, and likely genetic determinants of the response to hypoxemia.13 The L-type is the most common phenotype (> 50%).13 Those patients present with hypoxemia and hypocapnia but without dyspnea. They have normal respiratory system mechanics, hence the reported term by several emergency physicians of \u201chappy hypoxic COVID\u201d because, despite significant oxygen desaturation, the patient remains alert and able to talk. While some may keep a normal respiratory drive, others may exhibit a significantly increased respiratory drive, which could induce a patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI).14-18 Hypoxemia in the L-type phenotype is thought to result from a ventilation-perfusion mismatch and loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction leading to shunt fraction up to 50%.11 As reported in the acute respiratory system (ARDS), the severity seems to correlate with the difference between the end-tidal carbon dioxide and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), which is an indirect measure of dead-space.19 The CT and chest radiographs reveal well-aerated compartments, patchy disease and ground-glass opacities with some peripheral involvement.20",

As those clinical manifestations are different, the treatment will vary according to the predominant pattern. Notably, a transition from L-type to H-type may evolve because of progression of COVID-19 pneumonia, injurious mechanical ventilation, and/or P-SILI.14-18 Regression from an H-type to L-type or gradual normalization has also been observed with CT during recovery (Fig. 1).20,21",

Traditionally, the response to oxygen therapy is assessed with the oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/FiO2 ratio22 or alternatively, when using peripheral pulse oximetry (SpO2), the SpO2/FiO2.23 Even though these ratios are well documented, they do not take into account the underlying respiratory workload. A PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 150 mmHg is considered a severe hypoxemic state and mandates close clinical supervision and intervention. The medical community is now supporting the use of HFNC as a clinically accepted adjunct approach to treating hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients.24 The literature from HFNC technology proposes a novel index, validated as a prognostic outcome of short-term HFNC therapy. This respiratory rate and oxygenation (ROX) index is based on the traditional PaO2/FiO2 ratio, but is then coupled with the respiratory rate.23,25 For practical bedside use, PaO2 is substituted for SpO2, so the ROX index is defined as the ([SpO2/FiO2]/respiratory rate). It can be calculated using an online tool (https://qxmd.com/calculate/calculator_724/rox-index-to-predict-risk-of-intubation).",

No predictive index is perfect, and a gray zone obviously exists between 3.85 and 4.88, in which it is difficult to firmly conclude what the optimal management should be. However, monitoring the ROX index over time, with emphasis from the 12th hour onwards, suggests that if the ROX index is \u2265 4.88, then the patient has a high chance of avoiding intubation. If the ROX index is < 3.85, then the risk of HFNC failure is high. In the initial study of the ROX index23 among patients in this zone, the ROX index could be repeated one or two hours later. If the score has increased, the patient should be considered with a higher likelihood of avoiding intubation. If it has decreased, then intubation has a higher likelihood to be necessary. If the score is unchanged, then reassessment should be performed after one or two more hours. The ROX index has recently been implemented by one of the authors (N.P.) and is being considered, along with advice from other experts in mechanical ventilation, by the French Ministry of Health, who have arbitrarily decided to re-assess the ROX index every 30 min.26 They have chosen a change in the ROX index of 0.5 to monitor the rapid onset of symptoms in the average COVID-19 patient compared with the usual ARDS patient. Therefore, a reduction of the ROX index by 0.5 from baseline over 30 min is considered significant and may suggest imminent need for intubation.23,25,26 Indeed, such a strategy obviously requires a prospective evaluation.",

Such repeated ultrasound imaging would be logistically convenient at the bedside without transporting the patient to the radiology department and would not involve any radiation dosing. Nevertheless, although lung ultrasound outperforms chest radiograph,60,61 it cannot be as comprehensive as CT since any lung pathology not involving the surface of the lung (and therefore covered by some aerated lung) cannot be detected by ultrasound. Lung ultrasound can be performed with a wide range of ultrasound machines, including handheld devices.62 The advantage of the handheld devices is that they can be fully enclosed in a plastic sheath, thereby reducing the risk of equipment contamination and spread of infection between patients. The performance and interpretation of lung ultrasound is much simpler than other imaging modalities such as transthoracic echocardiography as the images are easy to acquire and there are a limited number of patterns to interpret.63,64 Education can be scaled to meet the COVID-19 crisis through online courses (e.g., https://www.iteachu.com/courses/covid-19-lung-ultrasound/) simulation, and peer-to-peer mentoring.",
