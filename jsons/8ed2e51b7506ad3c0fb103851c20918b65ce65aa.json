Distribution 25 of injuries among patients in two TCs between January 24, 2020 and February 24, 26 2020 was described. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the correlation 27 between the distribution of Injuries in TCs and the number of COVID-19-associated 28 cases. 29 Results: A total of 757 TC patients in the two hospitals were enrolled. The number of 30 traffic injuries and outdoor injuries showed a significant decrease in the early stage 31 and began to increase on February 17. The number of indoor injuries neither 32 decreased nor increased. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant 33 correlation between COVID-19-associated cases and traffic and outdoor injuries 34 Conclusion: From the perspective of the injuries in TCs, community quarantine 35 strategy was effectively implemented and significantly slowed the outbreak of 36 COVID-19 in Anhui. However, the implementation and maintenance of the strategy is 37 costly and requires the participation of the entire population.",

            "text": "2019, a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were tested 41 positive for a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China(Sohrabi et al., 2020, Zhu N. et al., 42 2020). The virus spread rapidly in the city and showed strong infectivity and 43 pathogenicity. As this novel coronavirus shared over 79% of its genome sequence 44 with the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), it 45 was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2(Lu et al., 2020). The pneumonia caused by 46 SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently identified as a novel acute respiratory infectious 47 disease and was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Following outbreaks 48 in China and Asia, COVID-19 spread widely in Europe and the Americas. On March 49 11, 2020, 40 days after COVID-19 gained the tag \"public health emergency of 50 international concern,\" The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a 51 pandemic. As of April 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected greater than one million 52 people worldwide. European countries including Italy and Spain have adopted a state 53 of emergency in response to the outbreak(Albarello et al., 2020).54 Confirmed cases in China accounted for the majority of infected patients in the early 55 stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The initial rapid increase in the number of cases 56 had a huge impact on China's medical and public health institutions(Li et al., 2020, 57 Zhu Wanbo et al., 2020). Subsequently, the government took a series of measures to 58 respond to the outbreak, including the establishment of new hospitals for infected 59 patients and square cabin hospitals to quarantine suspected patients. A strategy of et al., 2020). The strategy, led by community committees dominated 62 by public servants, aimed to screen the densely populated urban population for 63 potential and latent infections and quarantine residents with definite exposure history. 64 The community committee in China is supported by the community administrative 65 department and all community members. It is administered by a working group 66 recommended by the government and elected by members of the community. During 67 this outbreak, all community members received the committee's standardized 68 questionnaire on temperature, symptoms, and exposure history for a certain period of 69 time. As part of the extended Spring Festival holiday, most jobs, schools, and public 70 places were shut down. Going outdoors was mainly for grocery shopping and to visit 71 the hospital. Members of the community were free to leave and enter the community 72 after the committee ruled out potential infections each day; however, multiple daily 73 outings were recommended against. After daily screening of all community members, 74 the committee shared the data with the Center for Disease Control (CDC). This date 75 sharing mainly included three ways: 1) the information platform would update the 76 vital signs of suspected infected and medical observation patients in all the 77 communities, as well as the information about the recent population migration in 78 communities, especially the areas with high incidence of infection;2) information of 79 patients requiring medical quarantine who need to be transferring in the community 80 today;3) telemedicine to guide the community in epidemic prevention and medical 81 resource allocation. For members with suspected syndromes and a clear exposure and performed the nucleic acid affirmatory test for the virus. For 84 patients who required treatment for non-COVID-19 diseases, the committee contacted 85 non-designated hospitals for admission. For members in need of drugs, the committee 86 extended help via a 24-hour contactless pharmacy. Meanwhile, during the period of 87 community quarantine, community members communicated with the committee in a 88 timely manner, including on social platforms and door-to-door(Rao and Vazquez, 89 2020). The committee also provided delivery services of goods to members unwilling 90 to go outdoors. The health of committee workers was guaranteed by the CDC. This 91 strategy of community quarantine in Anhui is illustrated in Figure 1. 92 Anhui is adjacent to the Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan. With the adoption of the 93 strategy of community quarantine on January 23, 2020, there was almost no increase 94 in confirmed or suspected cases in Anhui as of February 22, and all positively tested 95 patients were discharged on March 7. Previously, we reported that there was a plunge 96 in traffic injuries based on information from a trauma center (TC) in Anhui after 97 January 23(Zhu W. et al., 2020). In this study, the relationship between the 98 distribution of patients in two TCs and the daily number of new 99 COVID-19-associated cases was studied, while attempting to evaluate the role of 100 community quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in Anhui.",

            "text": "study, a strategy for community quarantine was described for urban157 populations during the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Anhui province of China. The 158 correlation between daily injury distribution in two TCs and new 159 COVID-19-associated cases was studied. The study revealed that the number of 160 traffic injuries and outdoor injuries in TCs decreased significantly after community 161 quarantine was implemented. Moreover, the number of traffic injuries and outdoor 162 injuries during the implementation of community quarantine was correlated with daily 163 new confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19.164 Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019, most cities in China 165 have quickly experienced outbreaks owing to the accelerated population migration 166 during the Spring Festival travel rush and the early limited understanding of 167 SARS-CoV-2(Zhong et al., 2020). Four months later, the outbreak is still not under 168 control globally and the rapidly increasing number of cases has already made a huge 169 impact on medical and public health institutions. As of March 16, 2020, COVID-19 more than 170,000 people worldwide and was deemed a pandemic by the 171 WHO. Due to the presence of latent and asymptomatic infections, as well as the lack 172 of a complete understanding of the transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2, effectively 173 controlling the source of infection in the population, cutting off the transmission route, 174 and protecting vulnerable people has proved to be difficult for public health policy 175 makers(Wang et al., 2020). Although epidemiological analyses and data models 176 provide references for controlling further expansion of the outbreak, there is no 177 consensus on a unified approach. 178 Previous studies have found that despite the presence of individual cases, the 179 incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is around 14 days(Lauer et al., 2020). The urban 180 population density is conducive to the clustering effect of virus transmission. To 181 prevent people from being exposed to asymptomatic and latent infections, as well as 182 infections of unknown routes of transmission, a strategy of community quarantine was 183 developed and widely adopted in the urban populations in China. The strategy aimed 184 to screen urban populations based on committees in their communities to ensure that 185 all confirmed and suspected cases in the city are detected in a timely manner. 186 Subsequently, the CDC provided effective nucleic acid tests for the virus in all 187 suspected cases by sharing data with the committee. Members of the community 188 excluded by the committee from suspected infection were encouraged to complete a 189 period of medical observation at home to avoid potential exposure and infection. Due 190 to the continuation of the Spring Festival holiday, most offices, schools, and public 191 areas have not yet been opened, which provides a realistic background for the members deemed uninfected by the committee and CDC were 194 not restricted to going outdoors, the impact of the strategy on injuries was noted in our 195 study. The reduction in traffic and outdoor injuries in TCs reflects the effectiveness of 196 the strategy. Moreover, this pattern of injuries reduction was relevant to the change in 197 the COVID-19-associated cases in Anhui after the implementation of the strategy of 198 community quarantine. The logical explanation is that as community screening 199 continues, members of the community are encouraged to stay home and travel 200 outdoors less. Confirmed and suspected cases were found and sent to designated 201 hospitals for treatment. However, with the end of the incubation period, the number of 202 cases began to decline rapidly due to the full admission of confirmed patients and the 203 community quarantine of the entire urban population. The number of people going 204 outdoors gradually increased subsequently, resulting in an increase in traffic injuries 205 and outdoor injuries. 206 The community quarantine strategy was phased out in March as the outbreak was 207 brought under control in Anhui. Recent studies suggest that transmission control 208 measures have yielded satisfactory results in controlling the spread of the disease in 209 Wuhan, averting hundreds of thousands of cases(Tian et al., 2020). As a potential part 210 of the control measures, the community quarantine strategy provides an idea of 211 medical and basic living support for community members. Researchers, including in 212 Singapore, have suggested deployment of the strategy to response to this global public 213 health incident(Koo et al., 2020).",

            "text": "of this strategy are equally obvious. Because of the presence of 215 asymptomatic infections, community members quarantined at home cannot avoid 216 familial cluster infection(Chan et al., 2020, Pan et al., 2020). In our study, new 217 confirmed and suspected cases did not begin to decline significantly until the middle 218 of the second incubation period. Moreover, in the second incubation period, the 219 number of new medical observation cases experienced a significant recovery, which 220 may be related to the screening of delayed familial cluster infection(Lauer et al., 221 2020). It is important to note that the implementation and maintenance of this strategy 222 are expensive. Community quarantine in a province containing more than ten million 223 people requires a large number of committee members and volunteers, while no more 224 than a thousand people were eventually diagnosed. Daily disease screenings, contact 225 with the CDC, and community services are costly in terms of human effort and 226 economically. The closure of work places, schools, and public areas; the domiciliary 227 of the urban population; and the shutdown of social services have had a huge impact 228 on the functioning of the society and the social economy. In addition, the possible 229 psychological effects on quarantined members of the community need to be evaluated 230 in the long term.231 Our study has several limitations. First, although these hospitals are the two main TCs 232 in the Anhui province, they still cannot cover all patients with injuries. Admission bias 233 is unavoidable. Second, we only studied the relationship between the number of injury 234 patients and the number of COVID-19-associated cases in Anhui, which may not 235 represent the implementation of strategies in other regions. Finally, we mainly 12 described the correlation between injuries and COVID-19-associated cases to attempt 237 to evaluate the strategy of community quarantine; more rigorous multicenter statistical 238 analysis of the strategy on the impact of outbreaks and injuries are needed in the a strategy of community quarantine adopted for the outbreak of 243 COVID-19 in Anhui, where nearly 1,000 confirmed cases were cured within 40 days.244From the perspective of the differential distribution of injuries in TCs, this strategy 245 was effectively implemented and significantly slowed the outbreak of COVID-19 in246    Anhui. However, the implementation and maintenance of the strategy of community 247 quarantine is costly and requires the participation of the entire population.",
