The annual average daily population in ICE detention has risen more than seven times in the past 25 years to a peak of more than 50 000 individuals in 2019.4 Many individuals in ICE detention have never been charged with a criminal offense. Immigrants in ICE detention around the country have expressed panic over conditions that put them at exceptionally high risk of an outbreak of COVID-19 and proposed an immediate humanitarian response to mitigate the risk of infection.5 Rapid implementation of infection prevention and control measures in immigration detention is essential to the wider national public health response. Although people who are incarcerated are confined, a high degree of interaction occurs between people in facilities and the community, including people being transported between facilities, releases and new intakes that generate a population turnover, and the comings and goings of staff, visitors, vendors, and contractors. Inadequate implementation of infection prevention strategies will affect the spread of COVID-19 in the community and burden an already stretched health-care system.",

Incarceration requires large groups of people to be held together in confined and often poorly ventilated spaces. Many areas within the facility are communal, including housing, waiting rooms, eating areas, recreation spaces, and classrooms. Disinfection and decontamination practices are also complicated by the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to survive for extended periods on materials that are highly prevalent in detention settings, such as metals and other non-porous surfaces.",

These actions should include the immediate release on humanitarian parole of individuals at risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 infection. An even more robust and effective response would be to release all individuals who do not represent a threat to public safety. This does not represent amnesty, but rather the use of existing structures within the DHS and the US Department of Justice to enforce immigration laws in the community setting.",
