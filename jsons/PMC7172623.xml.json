Of these 519 hospitalized patients negative for the detection of common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, 309 were admitted for ARTIs (see definition below) and 210 without any clinical signs consistent with ARTIs were considered as controls patients hospitalized for various non-respiratory diseases and systematically sampled for prevention and control of nosocomial viral infections in pediatric wards (Fig. 1\n). Each control subject was selected during the same period month in regards of selected patients (1\u20132 patients for one control subject per month; data not shown). Informed consent was obtained from the infants' parents and the hospital's ethics committee (Institutional Review Board of the Reims University hospital) approved the present study.",

At the end of the extension step, the Step-One-Plus Real-time PCR Detection system (Applied Biosystem, Saint Aubin, France) monitored real-time PCR amplification by quantitative analysis of the fluorescence emissions. The copy number of viral RNA was determined based on a standard curve of C (t) level versus the copy number of positive-strand transcripts of the CVB3 genome transcribed from pCR21C10A cDNA clone kindly provided by N.M. Chapman (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha NE USA). Transcripts were prepared with MEGAscript High Yield Transcription Kit and purified with MEGAclear (Ambion, Life technologies, Saint-Aubin, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Taken together our findings suggested that respiratory HEV strains might be more pathogenic than HRV strains and could induce more severe clinical symptoms in hospitalized lower ARTI cases. Among HRV positive lower ARTIs cases with bronchiolitis or exacerbated asthma (n = 121), there was no statistical difference between HRV-C and other HRV subtypes for respiratory distress (P = 0.72), the need for oxygen supply (P = 0.32) and for admission in intensive care unit (P = 0.99).

Because of a large EV genetic diversity combined with the continuous discovery of new species and new serotypes, the EV molecular detection by in-house or commercially available RT-PCR assays could fail and lead to an underestimation of the etiological and clinical role of HRV and HEV strains in pediatric ARTIs.4 Moreover, genotyping by capsid proteins coding region sequencing and phylogenetic analyses are presently required to distinguish between HEV and HRV respiratory infections.4 In the present time, it remains to assess the respective pathogenicity of respiratory HEV and HRV strains in pediatric patients, to identify genotypes or species specifically involved in upper and lower human respiratory diseases and to understand the epidemiology and the molecular mechanisms responsible for emergence of EV epidemic strains.4\n",

However, viral load levels appeared to be similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients suggesting that the clinical symptoms observed were more likely due to inter-individual susceptibility factors to the EV infection rather than to EV determinants of virulence.

In our study, all successfully typed HEV strains (10/15) were HEV-D68. This recently emerging virus was isolated from respiratory specimens for the first time in 1962 in the U.S. in children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.36 However, until recently, reports of respiratory infections due to HEV-D68 were rare.37 Over the past three years, outbreaks in Japan, the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as epidemic clusters in the United Kingdom have implicated HEV-D68 as an emerging respiratory pathogen.12, 13, 14, 18 In the present study, HEV-D68 strains were responsible for a low proportion of pediatric cases hospitalized for ARTIs. Our findings provide further insights into the potential specific lower respiratory tract tropism of HEV-D68 and increase our awareness of the clinical role of these strains. Among our genotyped HRV strains, the HRV-C species appeared to be the leading cause of infection far ahead of HRV-A and B species. However in the present work, the high number of untypable HRV strains highlighted the difficulty to amplify and sequence viral capsid gene RNA sequences extracted from clinical respiratory samples.",

This suggested that the severity and duration of HRV or HEV respiratory symptoms could have been responsible for an inadequate and probabilistic prescription of antibiotics by the pediatricians. These findings highlighted the potential interest to routinely perform an RT-PCR assay allowing a rapid EV detection in NPAs samples taken from pediatric patients hospitalized for ARTIs. Moreover it could be interesting to implement the most popular commercially available multiplex respiratory virus assays like the RVP and FilmArray by adding a specific HEV molecular identification using specific probes.38 Indeed, such implemented multiplex RT-PCR assays might allow to reinforce clinical monitoring of HEV positive children and to discontinue antibiotic treatments in case of a positive EV etiological identification. The benefits would include not only economic savings but also the prevention of emergence of antibiotic resistance.",

The present work highlights the need to perform a broad HEV and HRV molecular detection in the respiratory samples of pediatric patients hospitalized for lower ARTIs, which results could improve the clinical and therapeutic management of children hospitalized in pediatric wards.",
