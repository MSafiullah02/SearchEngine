There is a need to help older adults integrate simple, safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. In France, based on individuals' initiatives, local structures have sent booklets of physical activity advice and exercises to older adults.",

Some of them are very interesting, such as FFPEVG video clips [16] , the website of the French Ministry of Sports [17] , or the United Kingdom National Health Service guide [18] aiming to encourage older adults to perform physical activity at home. Our study suggests that older adults do not want to use these online tools. Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. Among older adults, there are cultural, sociological, and economic differences that need to be considered when developing targeted messages that echo a target audience's existing views and practices, to produce more powerful persuasive effects. Behavioral segmentation can help better understand and target messages for high-risk subgroups [19] like older adults.",
