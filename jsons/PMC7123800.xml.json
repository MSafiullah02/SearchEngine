Uniserial colonies are also called \u201crunners\u201d and do not form large assemblages, whereas multiserial colonies perform lateral and distal growth and tend to persist, with the possibility of forming large assemblages. Multiserial colonies, hence, are able to form \u201cforests\u201d and behave as trees, whereas uniserial colonies are more similar to weeds. The two strategies are also used to distinguish guerrilla from phalanx species (Humphrey and Pyke 1998). Philopatric colonies (Knowlton and Jackson 1993) can produce a high number of genetically identical colonies (each termed a ramet) that, together, form a genet: an assemblage of genetically identical ramets. This tendency is conducive to the formation of animal forests.",

Small hydroids are mostly overlooked, being considered as mere epizoites. Consequently, very little information is available on the ecological traits of small hydroids and the role they play in both benthic and pelagic communities.

For the Mediterranean Sea, for example, in the list of habitats assembled by RAC-SPA (2006), there is just a single item comprising all hydroid forests (i.e., facies with large hydrozoa), whereas each type of algal forests is carefully identified with the name of the main species; the same treatment is given to the Bryozoa.

In these seasonal species, hydranth resorption or shedding occurs in response to periodic adverse environmental conditions, followed by dormancy of remaining fragments of tissue (coenosarc) enclosed in stems or hydrorhizae acting as resting stages (Bouillon et al. 2006). When environmental conditions become favorable again, the regeneration of the colonies takes place from the dormant tissue.",

The duration of dormancy/active phases can change along bathymetric or geographical ranges characteristic of each species. Deciduous forests undergo strong seasonal variations in their biomass in relation to fluctuation of an intricate mixture of abiotic/biotic factors (i.e., temperature, irradiance, salinity, sedimentation, oxygen concentration, food availability, space competition, predation). Further studies are needed to understand physiological processes triggering quiescence or renovation and to test the duration of dormancy in relation to different ranges of environmental constraints since research focused on a limited number of species (Boero 1994 for a review).",

This was studied in detail for the dominant winter species Eudendrium glomeratum Picard, 1951 (Boero et al. 1986) and later better formalized in general studies (e.g., Boero 1994; Coma et al. 2000).

A good example is supplied by the comparison of the different life strategies of (Cavolini, 1785) from different localities. At the Medes Islands (MI), E. racemosum is also constantly present (Rossi et al. 2012), whereas it is sharply seasonal in the Adriatic Sea (AS), where temperatures are significantly lower in the winter (Di Camillo et al. 2012a) (Fig. 2). The longer duration of the fertility period and the highest polyp production in the population from the AS are likely related to the conspicuous food availability of this area. The considerable food amounts ingested by the polyps from the AS (Di Camillo et al. 2012a) suggest that (i) the hydroid plays a role in energy cycling and in removing particles from the water column and that (ii) local trophic levels are a key factor regulating variations in biomass of this suspension feeder. Indeed, in the MI, the summer regression of the population of E. racemosum, as well as the low polyp production, is probably related to the summer food paucity (Coma et al. 2000; Rossi et al. 2012). Moreover, in the MI, the hydroid growth could be limited in summer due to competition with algae, as occurring at other localities of the Western Mediterranean (Boero 1984; Boero and Fresi 1986; Boero et al. 1986; Rossi et al. 2012).\n",

Habitat stability allows enduring species to develop large and sturdy colonies and to reach considerable sizes ranging from 20 cm up to 2 m: for example, Plumularia elongata Billard, 1913, Solanderia spp., or Millepora spp. at tropics; Lytocarpia myriophyllum (Linnaeus, 1758) on soft bottoms; Errina spp., and Amphisbetia operculata (Linnaeus, 1758) on hard substrates from temperate regions (Table 1, Figs. 3 and 4). Perennial hydroids can give rise to animal forests comparable to those formed by gorgonians. Those with calcified skeletons are probably slow growing, but their growth rates are poorly estimated (Lewis 2006). During their theoretically unlimited life span, perennial hydroids host several taxa of sessile and vagile organisms, represent a food source for several animals, and, in their turn, likely collect great amounts of feeding particles from the water column. These forests undoubtedly have a significant \u2013 but little explored \u2013 role in energy transfer from plankton to benthos (Gili et al. 1998; Gili and Coma 1998). Enduring hydroid forests can be indicators of habitat health conditions: for example, the presence of intact Errina gardens on hard substrates (H\u00e4ussermann and F\u00f6rsterra 2007; Salvati et al. 2010), Plumularia elongata on tropical reefs (Di Camillo et al. 2010), and Lytocarpia miriophyllum on sandbanks (Di Camillo et al. 2013; Cerrano et al. 2015) is linked to the existence of pristine or scarcely disturbed habitats.\n\n\n",

There are over 600 papers focusing on interactions between hydroids and other taxa, highlighting that hydroid forests represent a mosaic of microhabitats, exploitable by numerous and diversified organisms. The perisarc composition and the production of secondary metabolites probably affect the attractiveness of hydroid basibionts; moreover, the organic matter trapped by hydroid colonies may support detritus-feeder communities (Bavestrello et al. 2008), whereas other organisms such as amphipods can use the inorganic fraction imprisoned under the hydrorhiza to build their burrows (Genzano 2001). Even the smallest hydroids can host a dense microbiome, composed both of prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts (Fig. 6). Stabili et al. (2006) found prokaryotic communities on the perisarcal exoskeleton of Aglaophenia octodonta Heller, 1868, while \u00d6stman (2000) and Di Camillo et al. (2012b) reported bacteria on the bare epidermis of Pennaria disticha Goldfuss, 1820, and Ectopleura crocea (L. Agassiz, 1862). Schuett and Doepke (2009) recorded microbes inside the tissues of Tubularia indivisa Linnaeus, 1758. Among eukaryotes, the microbiome includes diatoms, sessile ciliata such as Vorticella and suctorians (Tazioli and Di Camillo 2013), foraminifera, and macroalgae (Bavestrello et al. 2008).\n\n",

Zooplanktonic preys, eggs, merobenthic larvae, phytoplankton, bacteria, and detritus represent the preferential food items of hydroids. The prey composition and predation rates vary in relation to hydroid species, sizes of preys and hydranths (feeding polyps), characteristics of the study areas, temporal fluctuations of environmental parameters (such as temperature, salinity, current intensity), and biotic factors (i.e., predation and competition). Captures are related to the food availability, which can vary daily or seasonally (Table 2). Predation rate is inversely correlated to digestion time (Coma et al. 1994) which, in its turn, is related to hydroid characteristics but also to environmental conditions (i.e., temperature and salinity, Kinne and Paffenh\u00f6fer 1965; Gili and Hughes 1995). Besides the size, other features of the ingested preys can condition digestion times, such as the presence of stiff exoskeletons (Orejas et al. 2013). Times required for digestion of some hydrozoans are compared in Table 3.\n\n",

As it might have been expected, specific studies (Gili et al. 1996; Miglietta et al. 2000) showed that small polyps mostly eat small food items, usually protists, whereas large polyps catch larger prey, ranging from crustaceans to other planktonic and benthic prey. Miglietta et al. (2000) distinguish active filter feeders that produce microcurrents that draw food particles toward the mouth (e.g., Aglaophenia) and passive filter feeders that extend their tentacles and wait for prey (e.g., Tubularia). The subantarctic hydroid Silicularia rosea Meyen, 1834, from the intertidal communities of King George Island ingests above all benthic diatoms resuspended by tidal current. The hydroid rhythmically expands and contracts its tentacles in order to increase the flow of particles toward the mouth (Gili et al. 1996). Some species with small hydranths such as Lytocarpia myriophyllum and Aglaophenia cupressina produce conspicuous amount of mucus probably acting as a trap of organic matter (Puce et al. 2002).",

Large polyp colonies with fixed gonophores such as the Eudendrium studied by Wasserthal and Wasserthal (1973) produce planulae that settle directly in the vicinity of the mother colony, so contributing to the persistence of the forest. Hughes (1977) observed similar patterns for Nemertesia. Furthermore, these large colonies do spend the adverse season as resting hydrorhizae and continue to occupy the substrate. Boero et al. (1986) showed that the forest-forming Eudendrium glomeratum has a mixed strategy, with new colonies deriving from planulae and old colonies that regenerate from the resting stolons. The life histories of most species, however, are unstudied, and further research is needed to substantiate these patterns. The presence of medusae, due to the high vagility of this life form, should have more opportunistic polyps, even though the medusa stage is present in most of the very specialized forms that live in strict symbiosis with other animals (Puce et al. 2008), whereas those associated with plants do not follow this rule.\n",

Analysis of records over time can provide \u201cearly warning signals of species\u201d that may encounter higher probabilities of local extinction involving several mechanisms at different spatial and temporal scales (Gravili et al. 2013, 2015). According to Puce et al. (2009) and Gravili and Boero (2014), in the Mediterraneran Sea, larger Halecium species (e.g., Halecium beanii, H. halecinum, H. labrosum) are regressing compared to smaller ones (e.g., Halecium petrosum, H. pusillum, and H. tenellum). Large-size Halecium species, in fact, can be considered as habitat modifiers that create wide marine forests maintaining and modifying habitats (Fraschetti et al. 2008; Piraino and Fanelli 1999; Piraino et al. 2002). Ocean acidification could affect hydroid producing calcified skeletons, such as stylasterids and milleporids, or the partly calcified such as the Alaskan hydractiniid Schuchertinia antonii (Miglietta 2006).",
