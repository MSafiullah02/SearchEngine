Some viruses escape from the early endosome (Funk et al., 2006), while others require the acidic environment of the late endosome (Lakadamyali et al., 2004, Wiethoff et al., 2005) or protease activity in the lysosome as facilitators for cytoplasmic entry and/or uncoating (Akache et al., 2007, Baer et al., 1999, Chandran et al., 2005). With this in mind, we used endosomotropic drugs (including bafilomycinA1, omeprazole and chloroquine) to examine the role of the endosome in phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells. Experiments with additional pharmacologic agents were also performed to determine whether lysosomal proteases or other host degradative machinery (i.e., the proteasome) might contribute to the inefficient transduction of mammalian cells by lambda phage vectors.",

The proteasome can also play an important role in virus infection. Proteasomal activity has been shown to enhance the efficiency of infection by several viruses, including both minute virus of mice (MWM) and reoviruses (Chen et al., 2008, Ros and Kempf, 2004). At the same time, other viruses such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) appear to undergo ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (Yan et al., 2002). Thus, transgene expression by AAV vectors can be significantly enhanced in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Jennings et al., 2005, Yan et al., 2004).",

Lactacystin is an irreversible inhibitor of the 20S-proteasome, while bortezomib and MG132 are reversible inhibitors of the 26S-proteasome complex.

The latter phage were generated by producing genetically gpD-deficient lambda phage particles in E. coli host cells that expressed a recombinant derivative of gpD, fused to a truncated PEST-like motif derived from seeligeriolysin O, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin of Listeria seeligeri (Ito et al., 2003, Ito et al., 2005), using previously described methods (Zanghi et al., 2005).",

We therefore conducted experiments to determine whether the presence of an intact PEST motif is in fact necessary for enhancement of phage-mediated gene transfer by the Tpell phage. To do this, we developed plasmid expression constructs that encoded the major lambda phage coat protein, gpD, fused to either wild-type \u201cTpell\u201d (\u201cTpell\u201d) or to a mutated derivative of \u201cTpell\u201d in which the two serine residues were substituted by alanines (\u201cTpell-SA\u201d), thereby eliminating the PEST element in Tpell. We then generated luciferase-encoding phage particles displaying each of these peptides on their surface, and used them to transduce 293 cells. Analysis of luciferase expression in cell lysates revealed that phage-mediated gene transfer efficiency in 293 cells was in fact enhanced by surface display of the mutated, non-functional PEST motif (\u201cTpell-SA\u201d) (Fig. 2\n). Thus, the PEST motif is not required for the enhanced cell-transduction phenotype of the Tpell phage.",

These differences are summarized in Table 1\n, and may influence the activity of the proteasomal inhibitors in different cell types (293 versus COS cells) as well as their ability to inhibit cleavage of specific proteasomal substrates (Kisselev and Goldberg, 2001). However, it is important to note that the overall trend in all of our experiments is the same.

We therefore performed a control experiment to determine whether proteasome inhibition might exert an effect on luciferase expression from a non-phage based gene transfer agent containing the same luciferase expression cassette present in the genome of our lambda phage vectors. For this experiment, 293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the human CMV major immediate-early promoter (pCMV:luc); cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of bortezomib, prior to harvest and analysis of luciferase activity in cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 4\n, bortezomib had no effect on luciferase expression in pCMV:luc transfected 293 cells. This strongly suggests that proteasome inhibitors enhance gene transfer efficiency by phage vectors not because of effects on gene expression/promoter activity, but rather through effects on the intracellular degradation or trafficking of phage particles (Ding et al., 2006, Douar et al., 2001, Khor et al., 2003, Yan et al., 2002).",

To investigate the role of endosome acidification in phage-mediated gene transfer, we conducted initial experiments using bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacular H+-ATPases. As shown in Fig. 5A, bafilomycin had no effect on phage-mediated gene transfer in either 293 or COS cells. To confirm that the concentrations of bafilomycin used were sufficient to raise endosomal pH, we performed a control experiment in which FITC-dextran-tetramethylrhodamine was added to 293 cells in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1, and endosomal pH was then assessed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment of the cells with 500 nM bafilomycin A1 was sufficient to raise endosomal pH. Thus, the lack of an effect of bafilomycin A1 on phage-mediated gene transfer efficiency cannot be attributed to a failure of this agent to inhibit endosomal acidification.",

In contrast, exposure of cells to a high concentration of chloroquine (CHQ) resulted in a strong and statistically significant increase in phage-mediated luciferase expression that was not further enhanced by co-treatment with lysosomal protease inhibitors (Fig. 8). This finding further reinforces our hypothesis that chloroquine enhances phage-mediated gene transfer principally via inhibition of lysosomal proteases. The fact that high dose chloroquine exerted a much stronger effect on phage-mediated gene transfer than inhibition of the two cathepsins (catB plus catL) is most likely a reflection of the fact that CHQ may inhibit other lysosomal proteases in addition to catB and catL.",

            "text": "Our experiments revealed that inhibition of the proteasome and of lysosomal proteases resulted in more efficient phage-mediated gene transfer. The proteasome has also been implicated in regulating infection by many mammalian viruses, both positively and negatively. In some cases, such as minute virus of mice (MWM) and reovirus, proteasomal activity has been shown to be necessary for efficient virus infection of target cells (Chen et al., 2008, Ros et al., 2002, Ros and Kempf, 2004). In other cases, proteasomal activity has been found to inhibit virus infection\u2014 as exemplified by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) (Douar et al., 2001, Jennings et al., 2005, Schwartz et al., 1998, Tang et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2006, Yan et al., 2004). The fact that proteasomal activity also restricted phage-mediated gene transfer suggests a previously unappreciated similarity in the post-entry events that regulate cellular transduction by bacteriophage vectors and mammalian viral vectors such as AAV. It remains uncertain, however, whether proteasomal inhibition promotes the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer because its interferes with proteasomally-mediated degradation of intracellular phage particles or because it alters their intracellular trafficking, perhaps shunting them from late to recycling endosomes (Ding et al., 2006, Khor et al., 2003). Further studies will be necessary to resolve this question.",

            "text": "We also conducted experiments to examine the role of lysosomal proteases in regulating mammalian cell transduction by our lambda phage vectors. Lysosomal proteases degrade exogenous proteins that have entered the cell through the endosomal pathway (Mego, 1984, Wibo and Poole, 1974), and might be expected to mediate the destruction of intracellular viruses. In fact, however, many animal viruses have successfully usurped these enzymes, and exploit them in their life cycle. Examples include AAV, coronaviruses (including the causative agent of SARS), filoviruses (such as Ebola virus), reoviruses and retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus type-1) (Akache et al., 2007, Chandran et al., 2005, Ebert et al., 2002, Golden et al., 2004, Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002, Moriuchi et al., 2000, Pager and Dutch, 2005, Qiu et al., 2006, Schornberg et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005). All of these viruses rely on lysosomal proteases to facilitate their uncoating and/or to activate viral fusion proteins (Akache et al., 2007, Chandran et al., 2005, Ebert et al., 2002, Golden et al., 2004, Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002, Moriuchi et al., 2000, Pager and Dutch, 2005, Qiu et al., 2006, Schornberg et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005). In contrast to these animal viruses, inhibition of the lysosomal proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L resulted in more efficient cellular transduction by bacteriophage lambda. This indicates that lysosomal proteases negatively regulate the transduction of mammalian cells by phage lambda, presumably because they degrade internalized phage particles that are unable to escape the endolysosomal compartment. Consistent with this, direct exposure of lambda phage capsids to purified cathepsin L resulted in a significant decrease in phage infectivity, and loss of capsid integrity (Fig. 9). It is therefore interesting to note that MG132, in addition to inhibiting the 26S proteasome complex, also inhibits cathepsins (LaLonde et al., 1998); it is possible that this may contribute to its potent effects on phage-mediated gene transfer (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The hypothesis that lysosomal proteases degrade intracellular lambda phage particles is consistent with the synergistic effect of proteasome plus lysosomal protease blockade on phage-mediated gene transfer (Fig. 8) and suggests that it may be possible to use pharmacologic methods to significantly enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene expression in mammalian cells and tissues.",

The phage-containing endosomes then either (i) undergo acidification and fusion with lysosomes, resulting in the degradation of phage particles by lysosomal proteases (C) or (ii) undergo lysis or recycling (Ding et al., 2006) (D), resulting in entry of the phage particles into the cytoplasm (E). Inhibition of lysosomal proteases results in stabilization of phage within lysosomes, allowing some phage particles to escape from this compartment and enter the cytoplasm (denoted by the dotted arrow; F). The majority of lambda phage particles within the cytosol undergo proteasomally-mediated degradation (G), but a fraction of the particles successfully uncoat and deliver their genomic payload to the nucleus, resulting in the expression of phage-encoded genes (i.e., the luciferase reporter gene in our vector constructs) (H).",
