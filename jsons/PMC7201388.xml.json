It mainly affects rural workers since they are in constant contact with the vegetation and soil, characteristic habitat of the fungus. The Amazon region is an important epidemiological site, where there is a high number of patients among the rubber tappers [1\u20134]. Lacazia loboi has a rounded form in the host (yeast), a refringent wall and homogeneous or granular cytoplasm. It is suggested that it occurs in nature in the filamentous form [5]. The lesions may present in different aspects: keloidiform, infiltrative, ulcerated or verrucous [6]. They may also be localized, multifocal or disseminated [7].",

There are individuals in which, in a short period, the lesions evolve to a more extensive and disseminated form and others that for many years persist with the localized form of the disease [9]. After infection, the incubation period is uncertain [10]. Many patients relate the appearance of lesions, especially those located in the auricle, with the arthropod bite, ticks of the Ixodidae family, which could be a type of vector [11].
