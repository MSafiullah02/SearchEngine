Multiple definitions of ARDS have been proposed since the original description by Asbaugh. In 1994, the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) expanded the definition to include an arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO 2 /FIO 2 ] of 200 mm Hg) with bilateral infiltrates on frontal chest radiograph, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension. The AECC also recognized a less severe form ARDS, referred to as acute lung injury (ALI), which used similar ARDS criteria but with milder hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FIO 2 <300 mm Hg) [2] . Although this definition of ARDS was widely adopted, criteria lacked explicit definitions for \"acute.\" Furthermore, interobserver interpretations of chest radiographs were highly variable, and ventilator settings such as PEEP and/or FIO 2 render PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios inconsistent. Spurred by issues regarding the lack of a clear definition of ARDS, experts from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), joined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), were empaneled to create an ARDS definition task force [3] . Out of these meetings emerged the 2012 Berlin definition of ARDS. This definition defines \"acute\" as the at-risk period for the development of ARDS, which was designated as within 7 days of the original insult. The experts also proposed three mutually exclusive categories of ARDS, based on the degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mmHg>PaO 2 /FIO 2 <300 mmHg), moderate (100 mmHg-PaO 2 /FIO 2 <200 mmHg), and severe (PaO 2 /FIO 2 <100 mmHg). The panel retained the requirements of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema as defining criteria for ARDS and added chest computed tomography (CT) as a potential imaging tool. Comparisons of ARDS definitions based on AECC and Berlin criteria are shown in Table 1 . An expanded definition of ARDS, proposed by Murray, classifies patients according to the severity of lung injury, associated clinical disorder(s), and the presence of nonpulmonary organ dysfunction. In this definition, lung injury severity is stratified according to the extent of abnormalities on chest radiographs, degree of hypoxemia, respiratory system compliance, and PEEP requirements, using the lung injury scoring system [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1406, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2567, "end": 2570, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2128, "end": 2135, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Definition and Pathogenesis of ALI and ARDS"}, {"text": "ALI/ARDS is marked by three sequential phases, each characterized by different clinical, histopathologic, and radiographic manifestations. In the acute exudative phase, damage to the pulmonary epithelial and endothelial surfaces triggers a cascade of events in the evolution of ALI/ARDS. The loss of integrity of the epithelial and endothelial barriers that ensues results in extravasation of a protein-rich edema fluid into the alveolar space. This form of increased permeability pulmonary edema is commonly referred to as primary or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and has as its histopathologic hallmark the accumulation of a proteinaceous fluid in the interstitium as a result of breach of the integrity of the alveolar and microvascular barriers within the lungs. Inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin, are also prominent features of the edema fluid which flood alveoli, creating large areas of ventilation-perfusion inequality or shunt formation. Widespread but patchy areas of destruction to alveolar type I epithelial cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to this type of lung injury, are a common early histologic finding. Type II pneumocytes are also injured, which results in disruption of normal epithelial ion transport activity, reduced surfactant turnover, and, consequently, reduced clearance of edema fluid from the airway. Loss of normal surfactant activity by activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils and plasma proteins also contributes to microatelectasis and shunt formation. Impaired epithelial cell ion transport further compounds efficient clearance of edema fluid from the distal airways. The precipitated plasma proteins, fibrin, and necrotic debris form hyaline membranes. Hyaline membranes along with marked hyperplasia of cytologically bizarre and pleomorphic type II pneumocytes are key components of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), the histopathologic hallmark of ARDS [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] . These physiologic changes promote decreased lung compliance and subsequent respiratory failure, characterized physiologically by severe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching and marked refractory hypoxemia. The inhomogeneous lung injury pattern is marked by perfused alveoli which are not adequately ventilated (physiologic shunt), while others are ventilated but not adequately perfused (dead space).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1943, "end": 1946, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1950, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1954, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1958, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1962, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology and Pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS"}, {"text": "Increased permeability pulmonary edema may also occur in the absence of DAD and is referred to as capillary leak syndrome.

Subsequent elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance may be significant enough to induce cor pulmonale in some patients. An extensive neutrophil-predominant alveolitis on BAL fluid and histopathologic findings of bizarre-shaped cuboidal type II alveolar cells are common findings [10] . Fever, leukocytosis, diminished systemic vascular resistance, and diffuse areas of alveolar and interstitial consolidation on chest radiographs may mimic clinical infection/sepsis during this phase, although an infectious cause is rarely found.

This leads to a cascade of events, including the production of the Toll-like receptors on lung epithelial cells and activation of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. The activated alveolar macrophages trigger additional immune responses, including cytokine production, which damage the alveolar-capillary interface and cause leakage of proteinaceous fluid into the alveoli, leading to the clinical manifestations of ARDS. Earlier studies suggested that neutrophilic inflammation was central to the development of ARDS. However, ARDS may develop in patients with profound neutropenia. Furthermore, stimulation of neutrophil production with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor does not appear to trigger or worsen ARDS in most patients. These observations imply that neutrophilic inflammation occurs as a consequence rather than a cause of ARDS and suggest that additional mechanisms of acute lung injury may be important. A role for proinflammatory cytokines in the initiation and/or amplification of the inflammatory response in ARDS is suggested by increased levels of macrophage inhibitory factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the airways of patients with lung injury. Anti-inflammatory activities of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFr), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1r), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interleukin-11 (IL-11) have been shown to modulate the development of ALI/ARDS. Alterations in the delicate balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway likely play a critical role in ALI/ARDS development and offer therapeutic strategies in the management of this disorder [4, 10, 12] . Accumulating evidence increasingly implicates platelet activation in ARDS pathogenesis and suggests that these cells are pivotal in a host of inflammatory effects that contribute to ARDS development, including increased endothelial barrier permeability and augmented neutrophil recruitment into the airways [13] . These observations have laid the groundwork for ongoing studies to investigate the role of antiplatelet therapy in ARDS [14] [15] [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1818, "end": 1821, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1825, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1829, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2143, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2270, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2275, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2276, "end": 2280, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology and Pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS"}, {"text": "The majority of patients with clinical risk factors for ARDS do not develop ARDS. Thus, genetic susceptibility is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. More than 40 candidate genes have been linked to ARDS risk, including the genes encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and LRRCI6A [17, 18] . Several molecular and immune biomarkers are being developed to identify distinct ARDS phenotypes. Although many of these biomarkers are currently in experimental stages of development, they hold promise in their potential for risk stratification of patients for ARDS and also in their ability to predict clinical outcomes [19] [20] [21] . For example, higher plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers have been demonstrated in patients with a hyperinflammatory ARDS phenotype. This subgroup of patients may have a higher prevalence of sepsis and vasopressor use and require longer periods on the ventilator than their non-hyperinflammatory counterparts [22] . Elevated levels of specific inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8, have been shown to correlate with lung injury severity and may predict unfavorable outcomes, particularly among patients in which elevated biomarkers occur early and persist throughout the course of ARDS [22, 23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 400, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 729, "end": 733, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 734, "end": 738, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 739, "end": 743, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1364, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1368, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology and Pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS"}, {"text": "Cancer patients are susceptible to a variety of overlapping ARDS risk factors including primary lung insults (pneumonia, aspiration, surgical and nonsurgical chest and/or lung trauma) and secondary sources of injury (drug toxicity, polytrauma, pancreatitis, hypertransfusion, sepsis, or septic shock that originates from extrapulmonary infections or noninfectious etiologies) ( Table 2) . For example, cancer-related primary insults, such as increased susceptibility to pneumonia or the propensity to aspirate, may be compounded by a variety of malignancy-related secondary issues, including toxicity from pneumotoxic drugs, blood/blood product transfusions, or sepsis. Major categories of risk factors that account for most of the reported cases of ALI/ARDS include infection, sepsis, chemotherapeutic agents (including molecular targeted therapies and immune-modulating agents), trauma, and aspiration of gastric contents. Radiation toxicity, tumor lysis syndrome, and leukoagglutinin reactions have also been linked to ARDS in patients with cancer. These conditions may act synergistically to increase the risk of ALI/ARDS. In a study by Pepe and colleagues, ARDS risk increased by 3.2fold among patients with three or more risk factors versus a single risk factor (85% versus 25%) [24] . Traditional widely held beliefs purported that specific lung injury triggers have no bearing on clinical expression of ARDS or disease progression, which are primarily dictated by the severity of the lung insult and efficacy of the therapeutic intervention. Recent studies have questioned the validity of support for concepts that suggest that the clinical and histopathologic features of ARDS are identical, regardless of etiology. These investigations have identified a differential effect of ARDS on lung compliance and responsiveness to positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP), with more severe reductions in compliance and decreased responsiveness to PEEP, ventilatory recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and other adjunctive therapies among patients with primary causes of ARDS versus extrapulmonary (secondary) etiologies [25, 26] . Reduced respiratory compliance and response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may correlate with a higher prevalence of lung consolidation in patients with primary ARDS as opposed to prevalent edema and alveolar collapse associated with secondary forms of the disease [27] . This distinction may be clinically important. The concept of ARDS as a heterogeneous disorder may offer more precise clinical management. However, frequent overlapping pathogenetic mechanisms and morphologic alterations often render distinctions between primary and secondary forms of ARDS imprecise, and the concept of treatment approaches based on etiology of ARDS remains controversial.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1285, "end": 1289, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2132, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2136, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2416, "end": 2420, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 378, "end": 386, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Etiology and Predisposing Factors of ARDS in the Cancer Patient"}, {"text": "Severe ARDS represents a classic example of lung failure whereby associated ventilation/perfusion abnormalities, shunts, or alterations of alveolar-capillary diffusion lead to pure hypoxia, at least in its early stages. By contrast, primary failure of alveolar ventilation, or pump failure, leads to severe hypercapnia and acidosis with only mild hypoxemia (Fig. 1 ). Impairments to any component of the ventilatory pump, including the respiratory muscles, central nervous system, and peripheral nervous systems, may lead to pump failure. Cancer and its treatment may adversely affect all components of the respiratory pump. For example, increased resistance loads due to tumors within the lung may cause intrinsic or extrinsic obstruction of the large airways, bronchospasm associated with certain chemotherapeutic agents, or concomitant COPD, and obstructive sleep apnea associated with head and neck tumors are (Table 3 ) [32] . Pneumonia is the most common and potentially lethal form of infection in patients with cancer, complicating nearly 10% of all cancer-related hospital admissions. In patients with hematologic malignancies (HM), rates of pneumonia may exceed 80% and is a leading cause of death, particularly in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and acute leukemias [33] . Studies by Azoulay and others have implicated pneumonia as the underlying trigger for ARDS in 66-80% of patients with either solid or hematological malignancies. This compares to an incidence of pneumonia-related ARDS of <60% among patients without cancer [32, 34, 35] . Opportunistic organisms, including invasive Aspergillus, pneumocystis pneumonia, and candidemia, are prominent causes of primary and secondary ARDS in cancer, accounting for up to 1/3 of cases [36] . Cancer-related and cancer treatmentrelated impairments in immune defense largely contribute to the increased vulnerability of these patients to infections and accounts for the disproportionately high incidence of ARDS in cancer. Cytopenias, treatment toxicities, and other immune derangements are frequent causes of recalcitrant pneumonias, particularly among patients with hematologic malignancies and following HSCT [37] [38] [39] . Bacterial pneumonia is the leading cause of ARDS in this setting [33] . Opportunistic fungal diseases, including invasive aspergillosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, and systemic candidemia, are increasingly common and account for a disproportionate percentage (31-36%) of pneumonia-related ARDS in immunocompromised patients compared to the 5-10% incidence in immunocompetent patients with ARDS [40, 41] . In addition, profound impairments in cell mediated and humoral immunity are risk factors for pneumonias caused by reactivation of latent viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus. These infections may lead to ARDS as a sequela of primary pneumonia or disseminated disease, particularly among the immune-suppressed HM/HSCT patients and the subgroup of HSCT patients with graft-versus-host disease. Progression of upper respiratory tract infections, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus, leading to ARDS may also occur [42, 43] . Other causes of increased vulnerability to pneumonia in the cancer setting include derangements in lung architecture caused by surgery, radiation or cancer itself, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and swallowing difficulties associated with thoracic tumors, pain, and sedating medications. Finally, repeated exposures to antibiotics and frequent encounters with the healthcare system may promote the development of pneumonias caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Once established, these infections may exact an inexorable course, with high associated mortality. Early etiological assessment and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, along with prompt initiation of critical care, are vital steps in improving outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 925, "end": 929, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1311, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1574, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1578, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1582, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1782, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2207, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2208, "end": 2212, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2217, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2289, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2615, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2616, "end": 2619, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3226, "end": 3230, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3231, "end": 3234, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 364, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 914, "end": 922, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Etiology and Predisposing Factors of ARDS in the Cancer Patient"}, {"text": "In the general patient population, ARDS is thought to complicate 6-7% of all cases of sepsis [44] .

Mortality rates in the cancer population vary broadly (6-76%), depending on the type of cancer surgery. Thoracic surgeries, in particular intrapericardial or extrapleural pneumonectomy and esophagectomy, confer the highest operative risk for lung injury (Fig. 2) . Postoperative acute lung injury in these settings is most often due to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, persistent air leak, bronchopleural fistula, and prolonged mechanical dependence. Nosocomial pneumonias with related acute respiratory failure complicate approximately 20% of thoracic and upper abdominal cancer surgeries with an associated 50% mortality rate [54, 55] . Contributions to postoperative ARDS in cancer are similar to the general population and include aspiration pneumonitis, massive transfusion, shock (septic, hemorrhagic, or anaphylactic), and excessive perioperative fluids. Thoracic surgical resections that involve pneumonectomy, extended surgical manipulation, and single lung ventilation with inherent hyperoxia and volutrauma also confer an increased risk of postoperative ARDS [56] . Few data exist regarding the prevalence of lung injury following lung resection. Most recent series suggest that around 5% of patients develop some degree of lung injury. Those that develop frank ARDS have a poor prognosis compared to those who suffer lesser degrees of damage. The pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS following intrathoracic resection remains unknown.

This likely reflects increased vulnerability to infection owing to more intense immune suppression among allogeneic recipients.

The diagnosis of TRALI requires a temporal relationship between transfusion of blood products and the development of acute lung injury and the exclusion of other competing risk factors for ARDS, such as pneumonia, sepsis, pancreatic, drug toxicity, or trauma. A growing consensus supports a \"two-hit model\" in the development of TRALI, in which an inflammatory condition, such as infection or trauma in the lungs, leads to sequestration and priming of lung neutrophils. With subsequent blood/blood product transfusion, antibodies and endotoxins in stored blood promote endothelial damage by inducing the release of oxidases and proteases from the primed neutrophils. This sequence of events results in capillary leak and acute lung injury [59, 60] . Although the precise incidence of TRALI in the general population is unknown, historical estimates suggest that TRALI develops in approximately 1 in 5000 transfused blood components, or 0.1% of transfused patients [61] .

Virtually all blood products, including fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells (PRBCs), platelets, granulocytes, cryoprecipitate, intravenous immune globulin, and allogeneic stem cells, have all been implicated in the development of this syndrome [60, 62, 63] . Specific risk factors for TRALI may be stratified according to recipient factors and blood product factors. Recipient factors include hematologic malignancy, critical illness, emergency cardiac surgery, massive transfusion, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and a high APACHE II scores [64] . General surgery, cytokine infusion, and active infection have also been linked to TRALI, although these associations have not been confirmed. Blood product factors have included transfusions of whole blood and donor gender, with increased rates associated with increased plasma or whole blood from female donors [65] [66] [67] . Numerous studies have explored the influence of RBS storage time on transfusionrelated adverse events, including TRALI and posttransfusion infections, with mixed results [68] [69] [70] . More recent studies suggest that transfusion of fresh (1-10 days old) RBCs does not confer superior transfusion outcomes to the standard practice of transfusing blood stored for up to 3 weeks [71] . Supportive measures, including initiation of supplemental oxygen and hemodynamic support, are the cornerstones of TRALI therapy. Noninvasive respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is indicated in patients with mild disease. However, approximately 70-80% of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation [61, 72, 73] . High-dose intravenous steroids have been reported to have success in individual case reports, although no prospective trials exist and existing anecdotal evidence favoring the use of steroids in the management of TRALI is limited [74] . Upon suspicion of TRALI, the transfusion should be immediately discontinued and the blood bank alerted of a possible transfusion reaction. With the recognition that alloimmunization during pregnancy renders multiparous women as high-risk donors in the development of TRALI, national and international risk-reduction strategies have been implemented over the past decade that exclude multiparous women as donors with the preferential utilization of males and nulligravida donors in whole blood and high plasma volume components transfusions [75] [76] [77] [78] . These mitigation strategies do not currently apply to platelet or red blood cell products, due to concerns that broader applications may result in donor shortages of platelets and red blood cell products. Other risk-reduction strategies, including use of solvent-detergenttreated plasma, and more stringent screening of blood and blood product donors have also been implemented.

Choriocarcinomas and tumors of mucinous origin from the breast, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys are associated with the highest rates of tumor embolization. Lymphangitic spread of tumor frequently accompanies tumor microembolization. However, either entity may exist in isolation. Hyperleukocytosis, variably defined as a WBC greater than 50 \u00c2 10 9 /L (50,000/ microL) or 100 \u00c2 10 9 /L (100,000/microL) with leukostasis, may result in leukemic sequestration and leukocyte thrombus formation within the pulmonary microvasculature. This disorder is most often seen among patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemias in blast crisis and is considered an oncologic emergency. The markedly elevated and poorly deformable blast cells are thought to plug the microcirculation, leading increased blood viscosity, leukostasis, and tissue hypoperfusion. Cytokine production by the dividing blast compound the problem by damaging the endothelial lining cells, resulting in alveolar hemorrhage [79, 80] . Patients with microvascular thrombosis typically present with an insidious dry cough, progressive dyspnea, and hypoxemia in association with echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Interstitial infiltrates suggestive of lymphangitic spread of disease may also be seen. The prognosis is conditioned by the type of malignancy (patients with acute myeloid leukemias in blast crisis tend to do worse) and evidence of end-organ damage (renal, neurologic, respiratory) [81] . Treatment of leukostasis with hyperleukocytosis includes stabilization with urgent efforts to reduce the WBC count with cytoreduction, hydroxyurea, and/or leukapheresis. Avoidance of whole blood transfusions may also help to mitigate blood hyperviscosity and symptomatic hyerleukostasis. Intravenous hydration, correction of coagulation abnormalities including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and aggressive platelet support are the mainstays of treatment. Initiation of chemotherapy for treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia has been reported to precipitate acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is thought to be caused by chemotherapyinduced pulmonary leukostasis and perivascular hemorrhage. This syndrome, known as leukemic cell lysis pneumopathy, has been reported following chemotherapy for acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Patients typically present within the initial 48 h of treatment for leukemia with severe hypoxemia associated with new or worsening pulmonary infiltration on chest radiography. Lysis of leukemic cells, with subsequent release of their enzyme contents, leading to diffuse alveolar damage and ARDS is the postulated mechanism of lung injury [82] .

Imaging findings vary with the severity of ARDS. Bilateral areas of patchy airspace consolidation within the lung periphery with normal cardiac silhouette and absence of Kerley B lines are classic findings on chest radiographs.

Thus, the evaluation and relevant testing should be performed as early as possible, starting with a thorough history and clinical examination and chest imaging.

In a recent retrospective study of the outcome of cancer patients following ICU transfer for ARF, the use of NIV was associated with marked improvements in patient survival [90] . In addition, significant reductions in both ICU and post ICU hospital mortality have been linked to the use of intermittent NIV during the early stages of hypoxemic ARF (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <250) [84, 108, 109] . The use of NIV has also been associated with significant declines in the need for conventional mechanical ventilation.

This intervention is potentially lifesaving and, at the same time, potentially deadly [5] . The ability of this therapeutic intervention to potentiate lung injury and contribute to nonpulmonary organ failure is well established [96, 111] . Increased respiratory drive and excessive pulmonary dead space are key features of ARDS. As ARDS progresses, these physiologic derangements drive minute ventilation to unsustainable levels, resulting in progressive hypercapnia. The goals of mechanical ventilationto improve oxygenation and eliminate CO 2are met through adjustments in tidal volumes, driving pressures, gas flows, and respiratory rates. Excessive adjustments in these parameters may result in ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). VILI is manifested clinically as volutrauma (excessive generalized mechanical stress and strain on the lung) and atelectrauma (injury caused by shearing forces as adjacent alveoli collapse and re-expand during mechanical ventilation). VILI tends to be heterogeneous, with injured or atelectatic areas adjacent to relatively normal aerated areas.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 268, "end": 273, "text": "[107,", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 274, "end": 278, "text": "108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 321, "end": 326, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 502, "end": 506, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 704, "end": 708, "text": "[84,", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 709, "end": 713, "text": "108,", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 714, "end": 718, "text": "109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1067, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1074, "text": "[87,", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1079, "text": "109,", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1263, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1406, "text": "[96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1411, "text": "111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Noninvasive and Invasive Ventilation"}, {"text": "Ventilator strategies in the past utilized large tidal volumes (10-15 mg/kg) and high PEEP (12 cm H2O or greater) in an effort to recruit and maintain open small airways.

The salutary effects of increased PEEP in improving oxygenation and mitigating atelectrauma are often offset by the attendant damaging consequences of high alveolar pressures and volumes. The adverse effects of these high pressure strategies are further aggravated by the inhomogeneity of lung damage in ARDS, causing some alveolar units to be under more mechanical stress than others.

Efforts to achieve these goals have been the subject of many clinical trials. More recent approaches advocate lowering airway pressures, which offers the dual benefit of minimizing over distension of the aerated areas and mitigating trauma from repeated opening and closing of the alveoli. The American Thoracic Society (ATS), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) met in 2013-2014 to analyze evidence regarding the use of ventilatory strategies established by the ARDSNET trial. Key recommendations that emerged from these meetings included lowering of targets for tidal volumes (4-8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory pressures to maintain plateau pressures of <30 mm H20. Low tidal volume strategies have been associated with a 22% relative reduction in mortality when tidal volumes are maintained at 6 mL/kg PBW compared with 12 mL/kg [96] . However, this strategy is limited by subsequent hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis as ARDS progresses. In addition, attendant low lung volumes and atelectasis contribute to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The utility of an extracorporeal carbon dioxide gas exchanger device or the veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) for removal of carbon dioxide has been studied with promising results, although this strategy remains experimental [113] [114] [115] .

This observation, coupled with concerns regarding possible adverse events from proning patients, including facial edema, of pressure necrosis with skin breakdown, transient desaturation, hemodynamic instability, dislodgement of lines and endotracheal tubes, lead to only sporadic use of this treatment modality over the years. However, findings from a patient meta-analysis of four major clinical studies as well as the PROSEVA trial clearly demonstrate a mortality benefit with prone positioning among a subgroup of patients with severe ARDS [5, [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] .

ARDS is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous condition, fueled by a variety of triggers. Specific triggers are now accepted as important contributors to unique ARDS phenotypes as well as prognosis and response to treatment. Thus, early and aggressive reversal of the inciting event is as pertinent as specialized treatment options, including ventilator strategies and other supportive measures. Furthermore, recognition of different ARDS phenotypes may assist in developing personalized ventilator strategies that consider each patient's unique physiology, thereby mitigating VILI and improving ARDS outcomes. Recent decades have witnessed pivotal advances in evidence-based ARDS treatment strategies. These advances have resulted in significant overall improvements in ARDS mortality in the general population. Survival gains have been largely attributed to optimized approaches to pneumonia and other underlying causes of ARDS, as well as increased utilization of multimodal treatment strategies that include lung-protective ventilation. ARDS prognosis among ventilated patients in the cancer setting have evolved from dismal to encouraging, although mortality rates remain high. The unique vulnerability of cancer patients to respiratory complications caused by the cancer itself, infections, toxic effects of cancer therapies, immune suppression, and cancer-and treatment-related cytopenias frequently contributes to severe lung injury that results in delays and oftentimes discontinuation of cancer therapy. Moreover, long-term morbidity and decreased quality of life among cancer survivors may be substantial. Because of the propensity for severe manifestations of ARDS at presentation, NIV may not be the best option for many cancer patients with acute lung injury. The prognosis following transition to mechanical ventilation following NIV failure remains bleak. These considerations underscore the urgent need for upfront conversations with the patient and family members, together with the oncologist and ICU team in an effort to design a realistic critical care treatment plan that avoids therapeutic intransigence while simultaneously considering the patient's wishes and life expectancy.

Other studies have demonstrated equally high mortality rates among cancer patients who failed NIV and subsequently required mechanical ventilation. NIV may be sufficient in cancer patients with mild or incipient ARDS, with mechanical ventilation reserved for patients with more advanced disease. Increasing NIV duration, steroid therapy, other organ failure (including renal failure), the need for vasopressor support, and lack of definite etiological triggers for ARDS are reported predictors of NIV failure in the cancer setting. Knowledge of determinants of increased risk for NIV failure may help to better triage patients for NIV versus early intubation and mechanical ventilation as first-line ventilator support. Patients treated with NIV should undergo close surveillance for early signs of NIV failure. Persistent hypoxemia, advanced ARDS, end-organ dysfunction, and altered mental status signal a poor NIV outcome and the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
