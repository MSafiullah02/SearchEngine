            "text": "\nI.Erythrocytes possess characteristic cell-surface glycolipid or glycoprotein antigens.A.A blood group system is a group of antigens produced by allelic genes located at a single locus and inherited independently of any other genes. Blood group systems are species specific.B.Animals commonly make antibodies against foreign blood group antigens. Naturally occurring alloantibodies may be a result of exposure to common environmental antigens that are similar or identical to foreign blood group antigens.C.The importance of any particular blood group system depends on both the frequency with which alloantibodies of the system occur and the characteristics of the alloantibody, such as titer, class, temperature-dependent activity, and ability to activate complement or agglutinate RBCs.\nII.Canine blood groups have the following characteristics:A.Current nomenclature uses the prefix dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) to describe canine blood types.1.Antibodies or typing sera for some of the originally identified canine blood groups are no longer available, and commercial typing sera currently test for six blood types in dogs (DEA 1.1, 1.2, 3, 4, 5, and 7).2.Several of these blood types can occur together on the erythrocyte and may vary in frequency with breed, geographic location, and antisera used (Table 71-1\n) (Bull, 1976; Giger et al., 1995; Hale, 1995).\nB.DEA 1 is a four-allele system.1.Dogs can be DEA 1 negative, DEA 1.1 positive or DEA 1.2 positive.2.DEA 1.3 also has been described in Australia (Symons and Bell, 1991).3.Naturally occurring antibody to DEA 1 is not present.a.Transfusion of DEA 1-positive blood into a DEA 1-negative recipient will result in anti-DEA 1 alloantibody synthesis and shortened lifespan of the transfused erythrocytes.b.Subsequent transfusions mismatched at that allele will result in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.\n\nC.DEA 3 and 5 are present in low incidence, and naturally occurring antibody to these antigens can occur (Swisher et al., 1962; Hale, 1995).D.DEA 4 is a high-incidence antigen with no naturally occurring antibody. A hemolytic transfusion reaction has been described in a DEA 4-negative dog given repeated transfusions of DEA 4-positive blood (Melzer et al., 2003).E.DEA 7 is a soluble nonerythroid antigen that is adsorbed onto the RBC surface (Bull et al., 1975), and dogs that are negative for DEA 7 may have naturally occurring anti-DEA 7 alloantibodies (Bull, 1990; Hale, 1995).F.\nCanine blood donors should be DEA 1.1 and 1.2 negative if their blood is to be used with type-unmatched recipients. Dogs that are 1.1 positive can be used with DEA 1.1-positive recipients.G.Dogs that are negative for DEA 1.1, 1.2, 3, 5, and 7 and are positive for DEA 4 are considered to be universal donors.H.Other RBC antigens may be present. The newly described Dal RBC antigen is capable of producing a hemolytic transfusion reaction in sensitized dogs (Blais et al., 2005).\nIII.The major blood group system recognized in cats is the AB system; cats can have blood types A, B, or AB.A.Types A and B are allelic at the same gene locus, and the A allele (A) is dominant over the B allele (a).B.The rare blood type AB is thought to be the result of a third allele; however, the exact mode of inheritance is unclear (Griot-Wenk et al., 1996).C.The frequencies of feline blood types vary geographically and within breeds.1.Type A is most common, with more than 95% of domestic shorthair (DSH) and domestic longhair (DLH) cats being typed as blood type A (Giger et al., 1989).2.Type B is seen in a variety of cat breeds (Table 71-2\n) and is seen with higher frequency in DSH and DLH cats on the west coast of the United States (Giger et al., 1991).\nD.Cats with type B erythrocytes have strong, naturally occurring anti-A hemagglutinins and hemolysins, consisting primarily of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and a lesser amount of IgG (Bucheler and Giger, 1993). Transfusion of type A blood into a type B recipient will result in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction following the first transfusion.E.Cats with type A erythrocytes have a low titer of naturally occurring anti-B alloantibodies, consisting of IgM hemagglutinins and IgG and IgM hemolysins (Wilkerson et al., 1991).1.A transfusion of type B RBCs into a type A cat may induce only a minor transfusion reaction in the presence of alloantibodies.2.However, rapid destruction of the donor RBCs will render the transfusion ineffective.\nF.Type AB cats have neither anti-A nor anti-B alloantibodies.G.Feline blood type A donors are essential, and ideally blood type B cats are also available.H.Neonatal isoerythrolysis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) may be seen in kittens with type A blood born to type B queens (Bucheler and Giger, 1993).I.An additional blood group antigen, the Mik RBC antigen, recently has been described. Cats that lack this antigen can form naturally occurring alloantibodies and may experience a hemolytic transfusion reaction if transfused with the Mik antigen (Weinstein et al., 2005).\n\n",

            "text": "\nI.Blood typing refers to identifying RBC blood group antigens by reacting RBCs with antibodies or other reagents in an agglutination or hemolytic assay.II.Crossmatching refers to detecting the presence of antierythrocyte antibodies occurring between the donor and the recipient.III.The rationale for blood typing and crossmatching is as follows:A.Avoid an immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction.B.Provide maximum survival of transfused cells by avoiding a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.C.Prevent sensitization of the recipient to future incompatible transfusions.D.Avoid sensitization of breeding females and subsequent hemolytic disease of neonates.\nIV.Blood typing is performed in both dogs and cats.A.Dogs1.Canine donors are ideally DEA 1.1 and 1.2 negative.2.If donors are typed as DEA 1.1 positive, blood is transfused only into recipients typed DEA 1.1 positive.3.Antisera for typing is available from Midwest Animal Blood Services (517-851-8244; Stockbridge, Mich.), but the techniques involved require laboratory skills and experience.4.Blood typing is also performed by some commercial veterinary laboratories or veterinary blood banks (send 2 to 7 mL of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA] or acid-citrate-dextrose [ACD] anticoagulated blood via overnight mail).5.Cards for the typing of DEA 1.1 are available from DMS Laboratories, Inc., 2 Darts Mill Road, Flemington, NJ 08822, (800-567-4367).6.\nGel testing for DEA 1.1 (Giger et al., 2005) is available from Diamed North America, Inc. (305-558-0161; Miami, Fla.).\nB.Cats1.Blood type A and B donors are needed, but the majority of feline recipients are blood type A.2.Blood typing can be performed by some commercial veterinary laboratories or veterinary blood banks (send 2 to 3 mL of EDTA or ACD anticoagulated blood via overnight mail).3.Cards for the typing of A and B are available from DMS Laboratories, Inc.4.Gel testing for A and B typing (Stieger et al., 2005) is available from Diamed North America, Inc.\n\nV.Crossmatching is very important.A.Crossmatching in dogs is advised, even at first transfusion, to detect the presence of antibodies to blood groups.B.Crossmatching is imperative in dogs that have been transfused previously.C.Crossmatching in dogs does not indicate that the donor and recipient are the same blood type, and thus does not prevent sensitization.D.Crossmatching does not guarantee that a transfusion reaction from white blood cell, protein, or platelet incompatibility will not occur.E.Crossmatching is crucial in cats because of the high prevalence of naturally occurring alloantibodies.F.Crossmatching is divided into two parts (Box 71-1\n).1.In the major crossmatch, the recipient's plasma is mixed with the donor's RBCs.2.In the minor crossmatch, the donor's plasma is mixed with the recipient's RBCs.\nBox 71-1Crossmatching Procedure\n1.Obtain an anticoagulated (EDTA) and nonanticoagulated specimen of blood from animal and donor.2.Centrifuge at 1000 \u00d7 g (2500 to 3500 rpm) for 10 minutes and separate serum from RBCs.3.Wash RBCs by adding 2 to 4 drops of EDTA blood to three quarters of a tube (12 \u00d7 75-mm size) of saline or phosphate-buffered saline, mixing and centrifuging for 1 minute at 1000 \u00d7 g. Decant the saline and repeat three times.4.After last wash, decant supernatant and resuspend cells with saline to give a 2% to 4% suspension (0.1 mL of RBCs in 2.4 mL saline gives a 4% suspension).5.Make the following mixtures by adding the indicated amount of the well-mixed RBC suspension and serum to 12 \u00d7 75-mm tubes and mixing gently:a.\nMajor crossmatch: 2 drops patient sera, 1 drop donor 2% to 4% RBC suspensionb.\nMinor crossmatch: 2 drops donor sera, 1 drop patient 2% to 4% RBC suspensionc.\nInclude controls: 2 drops patient sera, 1 drop patient 2% to 4% RBC suspension and 2 drops donor sera, 1 drop donor 2% to 4% RBC suspension\n6.Incubate tubes 15 to 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C.7.Centrifuge for 15 seconds (1000 \u00d7 g).8.Examine tubes for hemolysis and agglutination.a.Rotate gently to observe cells coming off the red cell \u201cbutton\u201d in the bottom of the tube.b.In a compatible reaction, there is no hemolysis and the cells should float off freely, with no macroscopic or microscopic clumping/hemagglutination (compare to the control tubes).\n9.Rouleaux formation can be falsely interpreted as agglutination. If rouleaux is suspected, a saline replacement technique can be used (replace serum with saline, mix, recentrifuge, and re-evaluate).\nG.A major crossmatch kit that uses gel tubes to detect a positive/incompatible response is commercially available (Midwest Animal Blood Services, Inc.).H.The major crossmatch is the most important for a safe transfusion.1.The minor crossmatch is of less clinical significance because donor antibodies administered intravenously are rapidly diluted within the recipient.2.Nonetheless, blood resulting in an incompatible minor crossmatch is best avoided for transfusion.\n\n\n",
