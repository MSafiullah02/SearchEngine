Although countries like India, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Nepal have reported their first confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in January, widespread examples of community spread have not been reported. In fact, contrary to such justified expectations/predictions, on March 13 2020, WHO declared that \"Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined\". Even though we are still in the midst of this novel coronavirus pandemic and the situation might drastically change in coming days, the disproportionately smaller number of cases reported from disadvantaged/low income countries remains puzzling.

            "text": "Ordinarily, a vaccine provides protection from a particular pathogen, by inducing effector mechanisms directed to that pathogen. However, certain live attenuated vaccines like the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, provide protection not only to a specific pathogen, but also against unrelated pathogens, some of which cause acute respiratory tract infections. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The underlying mechanism for the BCG vaccination-induced non-specific protection is thought to be mediated via the induction of innate immune memory, or \"trained immunity, as was first proposed by Netea and collaborators. 8 Trained-immunity inducing agents reprogramme bone marrow hematopietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors through epigenetic and metabolic changes, resulting in a more robust response in differentiated innate immune cells, following encounter with a pathogen. [8] [9] Of interest, in a randomized placebo-controlled human study, BCG vaccination was demonstrated to induce epigenetic reprograming in monocytes, conferring protection against experimental infection with an attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine strain. 10 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that countries who continue BCG immunization programs would contain the spread of this new coronavirus better than those that did not have or have ceased their national BCG vaccination programs. To check the validity of this hypothesis, we compared the number of cases and deaths per million people from 40 countries with at least 500 cases according to their BCG vaccination status ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). Case numbers per million people in countries with a national BCG vaccination programme were statistically significantly lower than those that did not have or have ceased their national BCG vaccination programs (P<0.0001). Since case numbers are dependent on SARS-CoV-2 testing capability of each country and might not be representative of the true extent of the regional epidemic, we also compared the number of deaths per million. Results showed that COVID-19 associated deaths relative to the size of the population were statistically significantly lower in countries with a national BCG vaccination programme than those that did not have or have ceased their national BCG vaccination programs (P<0.0058).",

            "text": "The most affected country with the highest death toll was Italy, which historically never had a national BCG vaccination policy for all. Consistently, Italy also reports higher mortality rates compared to other countries. If BCG vaccination has a general non-specific protective effect against spread of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, then would BCG revaccination of populations offer a viable alternative of partial protection until a specific vaccine is available? If this strategy is worthwhile, then there is the question of which BCG vaccine strain to chose. The BCG vaccine strains that are employed in the immunization programmes of different countries vary widely. BCG vaccine was first introduced in 1921 and the initial seeds were distributed to various countries. During their serial passage, BCG strains accumulated genomic alterations, including deletions, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and duplications of genomic regions, leading to the emergence of several substrains. 11 Based on their tandem duplication variants (DU-2), BCG vaccines fall into 4 groups ( Figure 2 ). The DU2-I and II group consists of geneologically \"early\" BCG vaccine strains, including, BCG Japan, BCG Russia and BCG Moreau/Brazil, whereas DU2-III-IV are considered as geneologically more distant \"late\" vaccines strains (like Pasteur, Denmark , Connaught strains). 11 The vaccine strains differ in terms of their growth characteristics, biochemistry, immunogenicity, and virulence. In contrast to early strains, the late BCG strains are defective in the production of cell wall methoxymycolic acids and possess only the alpha-and ketomycolic acids. 12 Consistent with this difference, early BCG strains persisted up to 6 months in the mesenteric lymph nodes of vaccinated children, whereas no live bacteria could be detected in late strain vacinees. 13 Similarly, methoxymycolate producing early strains were more potent immunostimulating agents than the late strains. 14 Mycolic acids can condition macrophages to produce higher levels of IFN-\u03b3, myeloperoxidase and TNF-\u03b1 upon renewed exposure to innate triggers. 15 Accordingly, mycolic acids constitute an important group of ligands capable of inducing trained immunity. In this respect, methoxymycolic acids were found to be inflammatory and to activate macrophages, whereas, keto mycolic acids promote anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated macrophages. 16 Therefore, since the persistence and immunostimulatory properties of BCG strains differ, their potential to induce trained immunity in vaccinated individuals could also hypothetically vary. representing the most modified and highly attenuated strains deficient of methoxymycolic acids when compared to the Japan and Russia strains. [19] [20] It is conceivable that the trained immunity induced by the Iran and China BCG vaccine strains are short-lived compared to those conferred by the widely utilized older strains.",
