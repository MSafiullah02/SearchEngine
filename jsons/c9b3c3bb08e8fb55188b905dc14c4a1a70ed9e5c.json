It indicates Pangolin-CoV has 10 similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, and would be helpful to trace the origin and 11 probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. 12 In the late December of 2019, an epidemic pneumonia (the W.H.O. announced it 1 recently as Corona Virus Disease (1) ) outbreak in city of Wuhan in China and 2 soon widely spreads all over the world. According to authoritative statistics, the COVID-3 19 has caused more than 40,000 laboratory-confirmed infections with more than 1000 4 deaths by 12 February 2020 and is still increasing. It was caused by a novel identified 5 coronavirus 2019-nCoV (the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 6 renamed this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 (1)). 7 Released complete genomes of 2019-nCoVs (2, 3) have helped rapid identification and 8 diagnosis of the COVID-19. Another key task is to find potential origin of 2019-nCoV(4). 9 Unsurprisingly, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV(5), the bat is still a probable origin of the 10 2019-nCoV because the 2019-nCoV shared 96% whole genome identity with a bat 11 coronavirus Bat-CoV-RaTG13 from Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province(2). 12 However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV usually pass into medium host like civets or camels 13 before leaping to humans(4). It indicates that the 2019n-Cov was probably transmitted to 14 humans by some other animals. Considering the earliest COVID-19 patient reported no 15 exposure at the seafood market (6) Center of China (7) firstly detected the existence of SARS-liked coronavirus from lung 19 samples of two dead Malayan Pangolins with a frothy liquid in lung and pulmonary fibrosis, 20 which is close on the outbreak of COVID-19. From their published results, all virus contigs 1 assembled from 2 lung samples (lung07, lung08) showed not high identities ranging from 2 80.24% to 88.93% with known SARS coronavirus. Hence, we conjectured that dead 3 Malayan pangolin may carry a new coronavirus close to 2019-nCoV. 4 To confirm our assumption, we downloaded raw RNA-seq data (SRA accession 5 number PRJNA573298) of those two lung samples from SRA and conducted consistent 6 quality control and contamination removing as described by Liu's study (7) . We found 1882 7 clean reads from lung08 sample mapped upon 2019-nCoV reference genome (GenBank 8 Accession MN908947)(3) with high genome coverage of 76.02%. We performed de novo 9 assembly of those reads and totally obtained 36 contigs with length ranging from 287bp to 10 2187bp with mean length of 700bp. Blasting against proteins from 2845 coronavirus 11 reference genomes including RaTG13, 2019-nCoVs and other known coronaviruses, we 12 found 22 contigs can be best matched to 2019-nCoVs (70.6%-100% aa identity; average: 13 95.41%) and 12 contigs matched to Bat SARS-like coronavirus (92.7%-100% aa identity; 14 average: 97.48%) (Table S1 ). These results indicate Malayan pangolin indeed carries a 15 novel coronavirus (here named as Pangolin-CoV) close to 2019-nCoV. 16 Using reference-guided scaffolding approach, we created Pangolin-CoV draft 17 genome (19,587 bp) based on the above 34 contigs. Remapping 1882 reads against the draft 18 genome resulted in 99.99% genome coverage at a mean depth of 7.71 X (range: 1X-47X) 19 ( Figure 1A) . Based on Simplot analysis, Pangolin-Cov showed highly overall genome 20 sequence identity throughout the genomes to RaTG13 (90.55%) and 2019-nCoV (91.02%) 1 ( Figure 1B) , although there is greatly high identity 96.2% between 2019-nCoV and 2 RaTG13(3). Another SARS-like coronavirus more similar to Pangolin-Cov were Bat 3 SARSr-CoV ZXC21(85.65%) and Bat SARSr-CoV ZC45 (85.01%). These results indicate 4 Pangolin-Cov may be the common origin of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. 5 The viral genome organization of Pangolin-Cov was characterized by sequence 6 alignment against 2019-nCoV (GenBank Accession MN908947) and RaTG13. The 7 Pangolin-Cov genome consists of six major open reading frames (ORFs) common to 8 coronaviruses and other four accessory genes ( Figure 1C and Table S2 ). Further analysis 9 indicates that Pangolin-Cov genes covered 2019-nCoV genes with coverage ranging from 10 45.8% to 100% (average coverage 76.9%). Pangolin-Cov genes shared high average 11 nucleotide and amino identity with both 2019-nCoV (MN908947) (93.2% nt/ 94.1% aa) 12 and RaTG13 (92.8% nt/93.5% aa) ( Figure 1C and Table S2) . Surprisingly, some of 13 Pangolin-Cov genes showed higher aa sequence identity to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13, 14 including orf1b (73.4/72.8), S-protein (97.5/95.4), orf7a (96.9/93.6), and orf10 (97.3/94.6).",

            "text": "High S-protein amino acid identity implies function similarity between Pangolin-Cov and 16 2019-nCoV. 17 To determine the evolutionary relationships among Pangolin-Cov, 2019-nCoV and 18 previously identified coronaviruses, we estimated phylogenetic trees based on the 19 nucleotide sequences of the whole genome sequence, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 20 gene (RdRp), non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b, and the main structural proteins 1 encoded by the S and M genes. In all phylogenies, Pangolin-CoV, RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV 2 were clustered into a well-supported group, here named as \"SARS-CoV-2 group\" ( Figure   3 2 and Figures S1 to S2) . This group represents a novel Beta-coronaviruses group. Within 4 this group, RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV was grouped together, and the Pangolin-CoV was 5 their lowest common ancestor. However, whether the basal position of the SARS-CoV-2 6 group is SARSr-CoV ZXC21 and/or SARSr-CoV ZC45 or not is still in debate. Such 7 debate also occurred in both Wu et al.(3) and Zhou et al. (2) studies. Possible explanation 8 is due to a past history of recombination in Beta-CoV group(3). It is noteworthy that our 9 discovered evolutionary relationships of coronaviruses shown by the whole genome, RdRp 10 gene, and S-gene were highly consistent with that discovered by complete genome 11 information in Zhou et al. study(2) . It indicates our Pangolin-CoV draft genome has enough 12 genomic information to trace true evolutionary position of Pangolin-CoV in coronaviruses. 13 The coronavirus spike (S) protein consisting of 2 subunits (S1 and S2) mediates 14 infection of receptor-expressing host cells and is a critical target for antiviral neutralizing 15 antibodies. S1 contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) about 193 amino acid fragment, 16 which is responsible for recognizing and binding with the cell surface receptor (8, 9) . Zhou 17 et al. had experimentally confirmed that 2019-nCoV is able to use human, Chinese 18 horseshoe bats, civet, and pig ACE2 as an entry receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells(2), 19 suggesting the RBD of 2019-nCoV mediates infection to human and other animals. To gain 20 a sequence-level insight into understanding pathogen potential of Pangolin-Cov, we 1 investigated the amino acid variation pattern of S1 protein from Pangolin-CoV, 2019-2 nCoV, RaTG13, and other representative SARS-CoVs. The amino acid phylogenetic tree 3 showed the S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is more closely related to that of 2019-CoV than 4 RaTG13. Within the RBD, we further found Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCOV was highly 5 conserved with only one amino acid change (500H/500Q) (Figure 3) but not belonging to 6 five key residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 (2, 9) . In contrast, RaTG13 7 has 17 amino acid residue changes and 4 of them belonged to key amino acid residue 8 (Figure 3) . These results indicate Pangolin-Cov has similar pathogen potential to 2019-9 nCoV. 10 The nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) is the most abundant protein in coronavirus.",

Aside from RaTG13, the Pangolin-8 CoV is the most closely related to 2019-nCoV. Due to original sample unavailable, we did 9 not perform further experiments to confirm our findings, including PCR validation, 10 serological detection, and even the isolation of virus particle etc. However, on 7 February, 11 researchers from the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou reported pangolin 12 would be the potential candidate host of 2019-nCoV for isolating a virus 99% similar to 13 2019-nCoV in genome (Data unpublished). Our discovered Pangolin-CoV genome showed 14 91.02% nt identity with 2019-nCoV, implying Pangolin-CoV could be different from that 15 unpublished. Whether pangolin species is a good candidate for 2019-nCoV still need to be 16 further investigated.
