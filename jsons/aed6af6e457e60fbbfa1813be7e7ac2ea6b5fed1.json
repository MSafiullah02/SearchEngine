Influenza surveillance has been conducted in Zambia since 2008; however, only 4.3% of patients enrolled in 2011-2012 were positive for influenza. Therefore, we examined non-influenza respiratory pathogens in children with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Zambia, to estimate the scope of disease burden and determine commonly-identified respiratory pathogens.",

All specimens were negative for influenza by rRT-PCR. The panel of singleplex reactions targeted seven viruses, while the multiplex assay targeted thirty-three bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Results: A set of 297 specimens were tested by singleplex rRT-PCR, and a different set of 199 were tested by multiplex rRT-PCR. Using the singleplex assay, 184/297 (61.9%) specimens were positive for one or more viruses. The most prevalent viruses were human rhinovirus (57/297; 19.2%), human adenovirus (50/297; 16.8%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (45/297; 15.2%). Using multiplex PCR, at least one virus was detected from 167/199 (83.9%) specimens, and at least one bacteria was detected from 197/199 (99.0%) specimens. Cytomegalovirus (415/199; 208.5%) and RSV (67/199; 33.7%) were the most commonly detected viruses, while Streptococcus pneumonie (109/199; 54.8%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (92/199; 46.2%) were the most commonly detected bacteria.",

Bacterial infections, especially those that cause pneumonia, are important because they substantially contribute to childhood mortality [4] [5] [6] [7] . Viruses also play a role, because primary infection with viral pathogens can pre-dispose children to secondary bacterial infection [8] [9] [10] , and a viral diagnosis can minimize the overuse of antibiotics [11] .

Viral pathogens were detected in 184/297 (62.0%) of the samples by singleplex and in 167/199 (83.9%) of the samples by multiplex assay. The higher percentage in the multiplex is likely due to CMV, which was the most commonly detected virus with the multiplex but was not a target of the singleplex assay.

These molecular methods demonstrate the need to continuously monitor and detect new emerging viruses responsible for acute respiratory illnesses. Historically, respiratory illnesses have been associated with influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus [29, 30] . However, with the development of newer, broad spectrum and sensitive molecular techniques, other viruses in patients with respiratory tract infections are being detected [30] . Our results point to the need to further explore and better understand the role of co-infections in children. We report a high proportion of dual viral/bacterial infections from the multiplex assay 167/199 (83.9%) which calls for careful consideration when associating particular pathogens with specific diseases [31] .
