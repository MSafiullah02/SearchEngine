Approximately 10% of patients hospitalized with CAP are admitted to the ICU [3]. In a multicenter study by Mongardon et al. in patients with severe pneumococcal CAP admitted to\nthe ICU, the mortality rate was 29%, with high proportions of patients in septic shock and needing mechanical ventilation\n[4]. Severe CAP is a progressive disease and patients may die despite early and\nadequate antibiotic treatment. The host local and systemic inflammatory immune response in patients with severe CAP is exacerbated\nand disproportionate and this is probably the main cause for the high mortality in this specific population, as it contributes to\nimpaired alveolar gas exchange, sepsis and end\u2010organ dysfunction [5]. In this\nspecific population of patients with severe CAP, adjuvant treatments, such as corticosteroids, may be beneficial.",
