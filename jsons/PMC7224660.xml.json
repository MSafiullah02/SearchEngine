Newly released analysis confirms deep concerns that patients with cancer undergoing active treatment, and/or with intact metastatic disease1, are among the most particularly vulnerable patients amidst this pandemic. Physicians and care teams helping patients with cancer have had to make or at least consider difficult decisions, including how to best balance the risk-safety profile of cancer treatment with emerging and rapidly evolving risks associated with COVID-19 infection and the broad range of potentials sequelae of this infection. This overarching concern is especially present for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, which represent a particularly broad set of diverse disease entities that require multi-speciality input and management. Along with the significant delays in cancer treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has also dropped down to 86-94%2.",

            "text": "Alarming data are emerging to support the hypothesis that the severity of COVID-19 increases in the elderly population and in patients with comorbidity. CRC generally affects people above 60 years of age, and COVID-19 further increases the risk for CRC patients, and patients with GI cancer in general, due to immunosuppressive treatments they receive. Our institution was one of ten cancer centers that recently published potential modifications that could be incorporated to help minimize patient safety for patients with GI cancers during this challenging time3. Other experts from areas of Europe hit most hard with COVID-19 have also published timely suggestions on management from the surgical oncology and operative risk aspect for CRC patients as well[4], [5], [6]. The presentation of center-based experiences for areas hit earliest and hardest by COVID-19 have confirmed that patients with GI cancer are at relatively high risk, especially with the high proportion of patients with metastatic/stage IV forms of cancer that usually would require ongoing treatment with palliative-intent chemotherapy. During the 2020 Virtual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) April 28, Dai et al. reported the first large cohort multi-center study on impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer, with confirmation that patients with cancer as a whole are more vulnerable to the virus. Of the total cohort of COVID-19 infected cancer patients, 19/105 (\u223c18%) had gastrointestinal cancer (type not specified) or esophagus cancer1. The percentage of COVID-19 in cancer patients specifically with GI cancers at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Paris, also presented at the AACR meeting, was 15.1%. The study from China from Dai et al. reported that the intensive care admission (ICU) admission rate for this population was 19-23%, with 30-35% having critical symptoms. Although the overall times to ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were not as short as in the lung cancer population, nonetheless these statistics should sound the alarm to reexamine how our GI cancer patients can best be treated as safely as possible during this ongoing pandemic. This point is especially crucial considering the many unknowns we face as a society in the months (and perhaps years) to come, including impact on health care of cancer patients with anticipated second and third waves of infection, and beyond.",

There are numerous practical adaptations and modifications for treating patients with GI cancer safely from a logistical point of view, expanded upon elsewhere3, that can help ease patient concerns. Transitioning patients to oral chemotherapeutic drugs in an effort to minimize in-clinic exposure to COVID-19 infection is just one specific example that can be easily implemented. However, from a broader and more strategic standpoint, now is the time to wholly reassess some strategies in this patient population, for standard-of-care but most especially for rational clinical trial design. We are and will continue to be forced to make this reassessment from every angle, including feasibility to avoid worsening already concerning extent of financial toxicity to patients, avoiding overburdening surgical staff due to a backlog of delayed surgeries, and ongoing concerns about availability of protective personal equipment (PPE), among many issues.",

Under normal circumstances such patients would routinely be scheduled for surgical resections as part of an intent-to-cure strategy for treatment; this is the case for multiple types of cancers, including early-to-mid stage forms of colorectal cancers, which have not to date met standards for the label of \u2018immunogenic\u2019 or otherwise \u2018hot\u2019 tumor targets for immunotherapy. However, the rapid expansion of the current crisis has not only forced cancellation of elective surgeries, but also made the need to assess risk/benefit ratio of proceeding with surgery during the pandemic vs. trying alternate strategies (e.g. chemotherapy prior to surgery) in order to delay surgery and thus minimize intra- and peri-operative risk of COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "Let us use the concept of neoadjuvant/upfront chemotherapy approaches, such as that used in the FOxTROT trial, as an example whose intent may be repurposed in the current setting. This trial, with results reported at the ASCO Annual Meeting in 20197, was an attempt to examine the potential utility of 6 weeks of upfront/neoadjuvant-intent FOLFOX chemotherapy treatment for patients with non-metastatic resectable colon cancer in patients with advanced T stage (T3-T4), clinical N0-N2, and M0 disease prior to surgical resection. Although there was no significant improvement in overall survival compared to upfront surgery, the report of histological regression in 59% of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy opened the door to consideration of alternative strategies and tactics, including sequence and timing of administration of standard as well as novel treatment modalities. [Note: the authors of this editorial were not involved in the design, administration, or any other aspect of this trial; we are citing the strategy as an example but not promoting its widespread use without further analysis]. While neoadjuvant chemotherapy may not be a current standard of care for resectable colon cancer, considering this approach for elderly patients, for example, and/or patients with other significant morbid conditions might confer potential benefit by postponing current risks of surgical intervention and potentially alleviate the congestion of OR schedules that many centers are facing and probably will face in the coming months. At least one group has published considerations of a similar strategy for patients with colonic (non-rectal) cancers5. Cancer-directed benefits would include potential for suppressing tumor growth while viably delaying surgery, and reducing the burden of micrometastasis, rationale that is the same for the growing adoption of this strategy for resectable pancreatic cancers8 and with rectal cancer using the \u2018total neoadjuvant therapy\u2019 (TNT) approach9\n,\n10. On the flip side, veering from the established standard of care also harbors risks, including progression of higher stage tumors that were resectable at time of diagnosis, and any neoadjuvant approach would be detrimental to any patients with near-obstructive or bleeding tumors at risk for colon perforation. Another drawback of the FOxTROT approach would be uncertain value without full lymph node sampling \u2013 the risk would be overtreating patients who ultimately were found to be \u2018downstaged\u2019 to stage I or II colon carcinoma, leaving uncertainty as to whether their cancer had already been at that stage, and negative nodal status, at the time of diagnosis. It would further be more challenging to adequately assess response to therapy, unless it were done via endoscopy to complement radiologic assessment, and biomarker assessment of carcinoembryonic antigen which may not be of much utility in half of patients who have normal baseline values at diagnosis11. The trial investigators noted that, while initial analysis was performed of the study population unselected for KRAS-status, there was an improvement of the hazard ratio when excluding patients with mismatch repair deficiency; the investigators\u2019 conclusion was that the neoadjuvant approach proposed by FOxTROT would be of most utility in patients with tumors without mismatch repair deficiency7. The trial is not yet published in its entirety, so some questions remain about the validity of this approach in larger cohorts and also among evolving changes in molecular targeted approaches for non-metastatic forms of colon cancer currently under investigation in other trials. Meanwhile, trial examining first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancers with deficient mismatch repair may provide further insight; such trials were scheduled to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and are now expected to be presented May 29-31, 2020 in the form of a virtual meeting. If positive for significant response rate, that treatment strategy (checkpoint immune inhibitor for resectable dMMR tumors might be an alternate method to consider in future trial design as well, especially for vulnerable populations in vulnerable times.",

Many cancer-related surgeries are required as part of an intent-to-treat strategy; the challenge will be balancing the urgency with timing that would still serve the patient for best possible outcome, and still preserve the safety of healthcare workers. With the hanging possibility that the current wave of COVID-19 infections may not be the last in the months and years to come, this is a question that will recur and be necessary to address for the future as well as the immediate present.

Such studies include biophysical and mathematical models of cancer cell behavior that identify patterns of tumor cell expansion, even occurring on the individual patient level13. At the convergence of mathematical oncology, cancer cell biology and immunology, there may be a meeting point that will help solve modern and urgent problems in practical cancer treatment by informing better timing of cancer treatment[14], [15], [16]. An adaptive therapy strategy and clinical trial design, based on prediction models of the evolution of cancer cell growth and response to drugs, are already being utilized for clinical trials in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer17. There is opportunity to leverage the evolution of the field of medical oncology as well to better incorporate perspectives from experts in mathematical oncology and bioengineering to likewise address this important aspect colon cancer biology into the way we design trials with therapeutic intent, with arms that reflect appropriate changes based on changes in tumors identified using serial liquid biopsies (e.g. ctDNA, pharmacogenomically profiled circulating tumor cells, etc.) and other biologic tools. The sequence and timing of treatment administration should also be closely be reexamined, as the efficacy of treatment of MSI-H tumors in this immuno-oncology era may be enhanced by staggering timing with chemotherapy. For example, our recent preclinical studies showed that resecting tumor-draining lymph nodes in early-stage tumor significantly reduces anti-tumor immune response, and that sequential treatments with chemotherapies and immunotherapies improve tumor control18. This finding will require further extensive investigation but provides preliminary basis for additional investigation. Clinical implications may include making an argument against traditional upfront resection comprising primary tumor resection as well as of regional lymph nodes, and more so in favor of upfront chemotherapy as a precursor to \u2018priming the pump\u2019 of innate immunity and thus establishing a long-term form of immune surveillance of cancer. In the current climate of potential risk of resection outweighing immediate benefit, at least for the foreseeable future, there is incidental opportunity to study this and other phenomena prospectively to confirm these findings in patients. While the COVID-19 pandemic has been thrust upon the medical oncology community in short order, we can take the time to reflect on the best way to serve our current patients and manage their treatment safely, while also reflecting carefully on how we can serve them even more effectively in the future.",
