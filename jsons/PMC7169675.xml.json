            "text": "One\u2010dimensional (1D) DNA materials, including nanotubes and nanowires, can be fabricated through the programed self\u2010assembly of DNA tiles, which have the potential to template the growth of nanowires19,49,50 and induce alignment of membrane proteins.51 Endo et al.\n52 reported a method to prepare structurally controlled DNA nanotubes that used a DNA tile system, with the assistance of a four\u2010way\u2010branched DNA connector. The connector was a DNA\u2013porphyrin conjugate, Porph\u2010(Tc)4, in which 10\u2010mer DNA strands were connected to four spacers of a tetraphenylporphyrin derivative. These connectors allowed planar DNA tiles to assemble into 2D array structures by taking advantage of the geometry of the 2.5 helical turns between two DNA tiles (Figure 2(a), left). The 2D arrays were assembled into tube structures in the presence of Porph\u2010(Tc)4, as shown by atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization (Figure 2(a), right). These fiber\u2010like structures could reach lengths of over 2 \u00b5m. A simplified approach for 1D fabrication was demonstrated in which the self\u2010assembly of DNA nanotubes resulted from one single strand of DNA,53 which resembled the self\u2010assembly of natural protein nanofilaments. In this procedure, a DX\u2010like structure was first formed from two identical, 52\u2010nt long strands with palindromic segments; regions with single\u2010stranded overhangs allowed the complexes to further assemble into 2D lattices, which were then folded into 2D sheets and eventually DNA nanotubes (Figure 2(b)). This one\u2010stranded assembly can provide a foundation for nanofabrication protocols, templated assembly of metallic nanowires, and even building tracks for nanomotors. Similarly, Kuzuya et al.\n54 prepared DNA nanotubes assembled from half\u2010tube components. Two different species were produced: a six\u2010helix bundle and an eight\u2010helix bundle. AFM analysis indicated that long half\u2010tubes readily self\u2010assembled to full tubes (Figure 2(c)). This study proved that larger tubes could be built from subcomponents that span only a portion of the circumference. Yin et al.\n55 prepared DNA tubes with monodisperse and programmable circumferences. They tailored DNA tube circumferences by specifying the complementarity relationship between modular regions in a 42\u2010base ssDNA motif. Following single\u2010step annealing, long tubes were assembled with specific monodisperse circumferences. To achieve a high level of dimensional control, DNA lattices were built using flexible ssDNA motifs that were much simpler than previous methods based on multistranded rigid tiles. By pairing specific modular domains in the motif, DNA lattices could be formed from parallel DNA helices connected by half\u2010crossovers, and from these lattices full DNA tubes could be produced with a variety of predetermined circumferences (Figure 2(d), left). Overall, the modularity and standardization of the ssDNA motif enables easy codification of lattice design, which allowed one to ignore molecular structure and interpret the lattice design in simple abstract forms. Tubes with 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 20 helices could be controllably prepared, resulting in width of open tubes that was proportional to the helix number (Figure 2(d), right).",

Recently, Aldaye et al.\n56 prepared DNA nanotubes with well\u2010defined triangular and square geometries based on a modular approach. In addition, this group was the first to construct nanotube assemblies that can exist in single\u2010 and double\u2010stranded forms with significantly different stiffness, in contrast to previously reported DNA nanotubes that were entirely double\u2010stranded. The assembly protocol began with the formation of single\u2010stranded and cyclic DNA building blocks with rigid vertices in triangular or square shapes. The blocks were longitudinally assembled by linking strands to form \u2018rungs\u2019 in a nanotube format. The rung structure dictated the final geometry of the nanotube, and the linking strands determined the stiffness and the persistence length. The nanotubes can extend over several micrometers and have a uniform periodicity along the longitudinal direction (Figure 2(e)). This method allowed for the creation of \u2018designer\u2019 multifunctional nanotubes, whose properties (geometry, stiffness, and single\u2010 or double\u2010stranded character) could be directly programed into the assembly process.",

Crosses and crossbars could be prepared by double printing of PDMS stamps (Figure 2(f)).",

Unlike the crossover junction with the same geometry, the T\u2010junction provides a right\u2010angled geometry to expand the varieties of DNA nanostructures.

This could enable the formation of smaller \u2018nanoscopic\u2019 details in DNA nanostructures.

However, one critical challenge in DNA origami is scaling up the size of DNA origami structures. Fortunately, Zhao et al.\n75 developed a new strategy that used rectangular\u2010shaped DNA tiles instead of traditional staple strands to construct larger scale 2D DNA origami: about four times the size of Rothemund's origami structure using the same length scaffold.

In the next step, the DNA polygons served as the top and bottom faces of 3D DNA prisms, both of which were connected by linking strands, and the vertical edges were additionally strengthened by rigidifying strands. This modular design and combinatorial assembly strategy enabled the fabrication of a large number of 3D DNA cages, including DNA cube and homo\u2010, hetero\u2010, and bi\u2010prisms.

This flexibility could promote curvature in the subunits that led to the formation of closed polyhedral structures, including tetrahedrons, dodecahedrons, and buckyballs (Figure 4(f)). Similarly, Zhang et al.\n66 used a symmetric five\u2010point\u2010star motif to construct icosahedra and nanocages.

Opening of the box lid could be observed by changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two fluorescent dyes placed on the DNA structure at strategic locations.

Inspired by conventional dendritic polymers, branched or dendritic structures can be designed from DNA, and these building blocks can then be assembled, via an efficient DNA enzyme (T4 ligase), into complex structures in a highly controlled fashion. Dendritic DNA nanostructures have been envisioned for a long time.88,89 Recently, our group realized the controlled assembly of dendrimer\u2010like DNA (DL\u2010DNA) from the enzymatic ligation of Y\u2010shaped DNA (Y\u2010DNA) building blocks.90 More specifically, the Y\u2010DNA was synthesized from three single oligonucleotides, each of which has partial complementary sequences to the other two oligonucleotides (Figure 5(a), left). For additional complexity, \u2018generations\u2019 of branches can be extended from an initial \u2018seed\u2019 (or \u2018core\u2019) DL\u2010DNA.

Higher generations of DL\u2010DNA can be formed in a similar manner. To confirm the generation of DL\u2010DNA species, the fourth\u2010generation DL\u2010DNA was visualized by AFM (Figure 5(a), right). In addition to high yield and purity, this approach has a number of other advantages including unidirectional and stepwise growth and nonreversible, efficient synthesis. Moreover, DL\u2010DNA can be manipulated further at the molecular length scale by DNA enzymes and the conjugation of different functional groups. Overall, these DL\u2010DNA structures could serve as templates for fabrication and synthesis of multifunctional structures.",

One of the requirements for these systems is that building block needs to be multivalent, anisotropic, and universally applicable. To address this goal, our group recently created novel, DNA\u2010based, anisotropic, branched, and crosslinkable monomers (termed \u2018ABC monomers\u2019) for the assembly of multifunctional nanoarchitectures for highly sensitive pathogen detection.34 The ABC monomers represent a modular \u2018plug\u2010and\u2010play\u2019 approach to multifunctional nanomaterials design. The creation of ABC monomers has enabled an entirely new polymerization scheme\u2014\u2018target\u2010driven polymerization\u2019\u2014where DNA\u2010based ABC monomers are polymerized only in the presence of a specific pathogen DNA target. As the polymer is much larger and thus easier to detect than the monomers by themselves, and as signals within each monomers are aggregated and thus amplified within one polymer, the target\u2010driven polymerization gives rise to an unprecedented sensitivity and specificity in molecular sensing. In more detail, the ABC monomers are formed from \u2018donor\u2019 Y\u2010DNA and \u2018acceptor\u2019 X\u2010DNA. Both donors and acceptors are linked together through ssDNA bridges (bridge sequences are complementary to regions of both Y\u2010 and X\u2010DNA). The Y\u2010DNA can be functionalized with different modules such as DNA capture probes, fluorescent dyes, quantum dots (QDs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and photocrosslinkable moieties (e.g., polyethylene glycol monoacrylate). These conjugations allow the ABC monomers to have almost unlimited diversity of anisotropy and multifunctionality (Figure 5(d)). To further demonstrate the specificity of multivalent conjugations, the ABC monomers were designed to have different predetermined ratios of fluorescent dyes within a single monomer. Through gel electrophoresis it was found that the fluorescent colors of the ABC monomers correspond specifically to the different combinations of donor Y\u2010DNAs as designed for each monomer.",

Six samples, including the controls of 27\u2010mer ssDNA with irrelevant sequences and a 6.1\u2010kb plasmid DNA, were first blotted onto a membrane; five types of nanobarcodes were then used to hybridize onto target DNA for detection (Figure 8(a), top scheme).

These ABC monomers formed dimers only in the presence of a specific pathogen DNA because the pathogen DNA served as a complementary linker DNA. On exposure to a short\u2010wavelength UV illumination, these dimers polymerized into polymer aggregates (polymeric spheres), with diameters of about 400 nm (from 1 to 2, and to 3 in Figure 8(b), top scheme).

Such a design allows the formation of covalent bonds between the linearized plasmid and the DNA network scaffold through ligation. Three mechanisms were proposed for the higher yield: first, the plasmid is linked with X\u2010DNA, which protects genes from degradation and denaturing, and subsequently leads to increased stability and prolonged expression; second, local gene concentration on P\u2010gel is higher than that in SPS; third, because the gene templates are confined, the enzymatic turnover rate increases and facilitates a higher rate of protein production. So far, this P\u2010gel system has been employed to successfully express more than several dozens of different proteins, including reporter proteins, membrane proteins, kinases, and toxic proteins with molecular weights ranging from 16 to 110 kDa. All proteins were functional with total protein yields of up to 5 mg/mL.
