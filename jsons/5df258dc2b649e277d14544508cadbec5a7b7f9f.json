The first case of COVID-19 in a LTCF was detected on 31 st March 2020. As of 27 th April 2020, 6 LTCFs in Singapore have detected COVID-19 cases. Despite accounting for <0.001% of total cases in Singapore, deaths of LTCF residents due to COVID-19 account for 14% of the total fatalities. This is similar to many developed countries where mortality rates are disproportionately high amongst NH residents.",

These included early pre-emptive management of LTCF residents with respiratory symptoms, transfer protocols between hospitals and LTCFs, increased temperature screening and social distancing and segregation of staff and residents. After the first LTCF case was detected, the Ministry of Health moved to suspend all visitors to all LTCFs for 1 month, implemented compulsory safe distancing for all residents and split-zones for LTCFs with more than 200 residents. Staff were reminded not to turn up for work if unwell. Despite these tough measures, COVID-19 still found its way into 6 nursing homes in Singapore (Figure 1 ). This spread coincides with the exponential community transmission in Singapore especially amongst work pass holders, a proportion of whom work in LTCF. This is similar to the situation in other countries where LTCF often face staff shortages that are exacerbated by the current pandemic situation. Staff management is a key pillar in any preventive strategy in LTCFs 2 . However, preventing COVID-19 transmission to LTCFs remains a challenge if community transmission is not well-controlled. This is because staff remain vulnerable to catching the virus and inadvertently spreading it to LTCF residents especially as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious even while asymptomatic 2 .",
