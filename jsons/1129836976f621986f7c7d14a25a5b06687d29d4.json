We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R 0 , the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a \"lockdown\" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the \"lockdown\" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Results: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R 0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. Conclusions: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.",

In an attempt to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies [3] . On March 23, with just over 6000 confirmed cases, the UK Government implemented strict physical distancing measures instructing individuals to stay at home and avoid leaving their house except for essential work, to take one form of exercise a day, and to buy essential items such as food and medicines. This followed the closure of sporting events, schools, restaurants, bars, gyms, and other leisure or hospitality-related businesses the previous week [4] and an increase in social distancing among the population that had been taking place for several days before the announcement [5] .",

Multiple surveys have been instigated on the uptake of different physical distancing measures during this current pandemic, but these have not explicitly measured contacts between people [6] [7] [8] . To make accurate predictions on the impact of these measures, quantitative data on relevant contact patterns is required [9] [10] [11] [12] . Many governments have adopted physical distancing measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear to what extent these measures reduce the number of contacts and therefore transmission. Only one previous survey-conducted in two Chinese cities, Wuhan and Shanghai, in February 2020-quantified the impact of these measures on individuals' contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic [13] .",

We defined isolation as completely separating from uninfected contacts, including household members, either in the home or in a health facility.

For each event type, they reported (i) whether they proceeded with their plan, or (ii) if it was cancelled or they decided not to go, and (iii) the frequency of the event type in the previous 7 days.

Furthermore, to reflect school closures during the collection of our survey, we removed school contacts from the POLYMOD data from our analysis.",

However, this projected decline in incidence will not result in an immediate decline in reported cases, as there are significant delays between infection and the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Hence, routine surveillance data are unlikely to show a decline in cases for some time.

Whilst we are unaware of any directly comparable data from the UK, our findings are certainly consistent with other reports from the UK of a dramatic reduction in social contacts, with, for example, only half of respondents in one survey reporting having left the house at all in the past 24 h [5] .",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this survey. Asking individuals to report their contacts from the day before may result in recall bias. Moreover, individuals who are adhering to physical distancing measures may have been more likely to respond to this survey, potentially resulting in selection bias and in an overestimate of the impact of these measures. The POLYMOD survey used paper-based diaries whereas CoMix utilises an online form, which may have resulted in different numbers of contacts being reported in CoMix. However, it is unlikely that the large differences observed would be due only to the reporting methodology of the surveys. Furthermore, we were not able to sample any children, so child-child contacts had to be imputed from the POLY-MOD survey. This weakens the comparability of the two studies, and future work is planned to directly measure child-child contacts which will help assess the impact of this limitation.",

            "text": "We were not able to quantify any additional effect from the interventions on transmission, such as reduction in infectiousness by increased handwashing. In addition, we were not able to calculate the net reproductive number, R, as we did not account for the proportion of the population that is no longer susceptible. These could all reduce the net reproductive number to values lower than estimated in our analysis. This approach further assumes that all age groups contribute equally to transmission, which may not be the case. Assuming flu-like transmission where children are the group most responsible for transmission, the contribution of adults to overall R 0 would be lower [9] . However, if children do not play a significant role in transmission, the significance of adult transmission will be higher. Therefore, although this survey provides evidence of overall contacts in the population reducing which will considerably lower R 0 , lack of knowledge of the relative contributions of different age groups to overall transmission reduces our ability to precisely determine the exact reduction in transmission. Our analysis assumed that direct contacts are an appropriate proxy for effective contacts, and thus, that transmissibility is equal across age groups (e.g. contact between a single infected child and susceptible adult is as likely to result in transmission as contact between a single infected adult and a susceptible adult). We further assume that the reduction in non-school contacts in children is similar to that observed in adults. Furthermore, we assume that the contact patterns prior to interventions are consistent and of similar magnitude. A recent study has found significantly lower numbers of contacts reported by teenagers compared with the POLYMOD survey [20] . Decreasing mixing among 5-17 years by 50%, whilst reducing the magnitude of reduction in R 0 , did not affect the qualitative conclusions from the analysis.",

This is consistent with a reduction in the reproduction number; however, it is difficult to correlate the magnitude of this reduction with the estimated value of R 0 . Our approach assumes that individuals within an age group behave the same, and does not account for hospitals and other institutions which will have different disease dynamics. Moreover, due to the UK testing algorithm being focused on people in hospitals and as there seems to be an increasing problem of nosocomial infection, any decline in community infection may be counterbalanced by an increase in nosocomial infections. Given that the confirmed cases are primarily hospital based, this can have a disproportionate effect on the estimated reproduction number using crude data (i.e. not split by route of transmission). Future work is planned to compare the estimates of R 0 with the growth rate of the epidemic, accounting for changes in levels of testing, reporting, delays, and transmission context. This study is planned to continue in the UK for the next 15 weeks and will be extended to other countries including Belgium and the Netherlands. Future analyses will be able to explore changes in contact patterns during different interventions and may provide early warning signs of changes in contact patterns due to interventions being lifted or decreasing adherence with restrictions.",
