It is based on amplifi cation of DNA at very low level under isothermal conditions, using a set of four specifi cally designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. This technique is found to be superior than most of the molecular techniques like PCR, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR due to its high specifi city, sensitivity, and rapidity. Major advantage of LAMP method is its cost-effectiveness as it can be done simply by using water bath or dry bath. Here, in this review information regarding almost all the effective LAMP techniques which is developed so far for diagnosis of numerous viral pathogens is presented.",

Viruses do not form fossils so the mode of their investigation/detection is only by using molecular techniques (Iyer et al. 2006 ) . Most of the viruses are harmful to animals ( http://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Introduction_to_viruses ) and cause a number of infectious diseases. Common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, infl uenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Ebola, AIDS, avian infl uenza, and SARS are various serious diseases caused by viruses (Emiliani 1993 ) . The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is known as virulence of virus. Viral diseases sometimes cause confusion with any other causative agent such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus six (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome (Thomas 2008 ). There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in human (Mandal 2013 ) . According to Shors ( 2008 ) viruses transmit by two modes, i.e., vertical (from mother to child) and horizontal (from person to person). Vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Varicella-zoster virus is another but rarest example of vertical transmission. Although this virus causes relatively mild infections in humans, it can be fatal to the fetus and newly born baby (Mandal 2013 ) . Generally living populations are affected by horizontal transmission of viral infection where viral transmission occurs via exchange of blood and by sexual activity (HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C), through mouth by exchange of saliva (Epstein-Barr virus), through contaminated food or water (norovirus), by breathing viruses in the form of aerosols (infl uenza virus) and by insect vectors such as mosquitoes (dengue) (Collier et al. 1998 ) . Currently, 21 families of viruses are known to cause disease in humans ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virus classifi cation ). So due to broad spectrum of harmful infections/diseases caused by viruses, a rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for timely therapeutic interventions (Barenfanger et al. 2000 ) .",

            "text": "Several methods such as viral antigen, genomic sequences, and/or antibodies are used for the detection of viral infection. Viral isolation and serological assays are standard methods of viral diagnosis. Both viral isolation and serological testing require substantial time to obtain accurate fi nal results. On the other hand, use of histological and biochemical methods for virus detection may sometimes fail to detect the virus antigen during the early stages of infection. Among various conventional methods, viral culture and antigenic detection (immunological detection) methods of viral detection are often costly, time-consuming, and less sensitive. Parida ( 2008 ) suggested that nucleic acid amplifi cation is one of the most valuable tools in virtually all life science fi elds, including application-oriented fi elds such as clinical medicine in which diagnosis of infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and genetic traits is based on this novel method. Several amplifi cation methods, namely, nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation (NASBA), self-sustained sequence replication (3SR), strand displacement amplifi cation (SDA), as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been invented in past days (Chan and Fox 1999 ) . Nonquantitative PCR and immunological detection methods are usually only qualitative tests with limited sensitivity and cannot distinguish infective viruses (Enteric Viruses: Rapid Detection and Identifi cation Methods. http:// www.rapidmicrobiology.com/test-methods/ Enteric-viruses.php ). PCR is one of the conventional methods which are affordable, but it has some intrinsic limitations such as the requirement of rapid thermal cycling, insuffi cient specifi city, and low-amplifi cation effi ciency (Mori et al. 2001 ) . Nested PCR and multiplex PCR have been developed to address the need for rapid identifi cation of viruses to serotype level with more accuracy (Ratcliff et al. 2007 ). Another novel technique, i.e., real-time PCR, is developed which in turn brought true quantization of target nucleic acids out of the pure research laboratory and into the diagnostic laboratory (Espy et al. 2006 ) . Mackay et al. ( 2002 ) reported quantitative PCR (QPCR) assays as most established assay for the detection of viral load and therapy monitoring. Nucleic acid-based assays or real-time quantitative assay might eventually replace virus isolation and conventional RT-PCR as the new gold standard for the rapid diagnosis of virus infection in the acute-phase samples (Ratcliff et al. 2007 ) . Besides, all these nucleic acid amplifi cation methods have several intrinsic disadvantages of requiring either a high-precision instrument for amplifi cation or a complicated method for detection of amplifi ed products. The high cost of instruments required for performing the real-time assays restricted its use to laboratories with good fi nancial resources (Parida et al. 2008 ) .",

LAMP is a powerful and novel nucleic acid amplifi cation method that amplifi es a few copies of target DNA with high specifi city, effi ciency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions, using a set of four specially designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (Notomi et al. 2000 ; Parida et al. 2008 ; Tomita et al. 2008 ) . When detecting the RNA genome of a pathogen such as an RNA virus, LAMP has been merged with reverse transcription (RT) into RT-LAMP to allow nucleic acid amplifi cation (Soliman et al. 2009 ). This technique requires only simple and cost-effective equipment amenable to use in clinical laboratories (Enomoto et al. 2005 ) . Compared to PCR and real-time PCR, the LAMP has the advantages of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity. It has been claimed that the LAMP method can detect as few as 100 copies of DNA template in blood samples, equal roughly to 5 parasites/\u03bcl (Han et al. 2007 ). This sensitivity is notably higher than any known immunochromatography-based RDTs, which are recommended by WHO as part of the global malaria control strategy (Long 2009 ). LAMP has potential applications for clinical diagnosis as well as surveillance of infectious diseases in developing countries without requiring sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel (Mori and Notomi 2009 ; Parida et al. 2008 ).",

Mumps virus was circulating throughout the world, but in the United States the acceptance of MMR combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella has reduced the number of patients suffering from mumps (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1998 ; Peltola et al. 1994 ) . Mumps patients having high vaccine coverage are prone to suffering from secondary vaccine failure (SVF) (Pugh et al. 2002 ) . Due to this critical problem, rapid detection of mumps virus by a fast diagnostic technique was necessary. Therefore, Okafuji et al. ( 2005 ) developed a fast LAMP assay for detection of mumps virus genome with a detection of 0.1 PFU along with the same sensitivity as RT-nested PCR within 60 min only. Similarly, Yoshida et al. ( 2008 ) developed RT-LAMP assay for mumps virus with a detection limit of 0.12 PFU/\u03bcl. According to a WHO report, approximately two billion people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and more than 350 million have a chronic HBV infection. Molecular diagnostic assays have provided insight into the pathogenesis and natural history of HBV infection and have facilitated detection of drug resistance (Lok et al. 2001 ; Corden et al. 2003 ) . Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for hepatocellular carcinoma (a liver disease) in approximately 350-400 million people all over the world (Dienstag 2008 ). Cai et al. ( 2008 ) detected hepatitis B virus by RtF-LAMP and determined the lower detection limit of LAMP by Probit analysis at the 95 % detection level (210 copies/ml). So, RtF-LAMP was more precise in detecting low titers of the virus which makes it more useful than real-time PCR in clinical applications. Moslemi et al. ( 2009 ) also detected hepatitis B virus by LAMP method and observed that PCR sensitivity was up to 40 particles, while the LAMP sensitivity test was verifi ed up to four particles.",

            "text": "Novel H1N1 (letters refer to haemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins on the surface of the virus; the numbers refer to slight variations in the forms of each protein) 2009 pandemic virus affected individuals worldwide and caused over 18,138 deaths since its initial outbreak in March 2009. Comparative study of sequences available into public databases suggests that since April 2009 a range of genetic variation has arisen in H1N1 viruses (Zhang et al. 2009 ). To eradicate the probability of false-negative results due to mutations in these genes, the RT-LAMP method was designed by Hiromoto et al. ( 2000 ) and Welman and Arora ( 2000 ) in order to detect the gene encoding the matrix protein, a type-specific antigen of influenza virus (highly conserved and undergoes less evolutionary change). Out of 57 pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus-positive samples identifi ed by virus isolation only one false-negative result was obtained when the clinical samples were tested with M-specifi c RT-LAMP. There are two possible explanations for the failure of the amplifi cation. It was worthy to note that, as the M segment of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is phylogenetically close to the avian-like swine lineage, one might be concerned about cross-reactivity when using the M-specifi c RT-LAMP with other avian-origin infl uenza viruses. However, unlike swine infl uenza, avian infl uenza A viruses do not commonly circulate in humans, and therefore the chances of this potential misinterpretation are low. On the other hand, learning from previous experiences during H5N1 outbreaks, any avian-origin infl uenza virus detected in a human specimen indicates a cross-species infection, which means that special precautions need to be taken. Hence, any possible lack of specifi city related to the M-based nucleic acid assay should not pose a particular problem for its routine use, and any human sample with a risk of being infected by avian infl uenza should also be tested using an H5N1-specifi c assay to obtain a defi nite diagnosis (Carr et al. 2009 ). The sensitivities of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specifi c RT-LAMP assay and a TaqMan realtime reverse transcription PCR assay performed with the SW H1 primer/probe set (WHO 2009b ) were compared by testing ten-fold serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed target RNA (from 100 to 104 copies) in quadruplicate. Both assays were equally sensitive, and the detection limit was ten copies of target RNA per reaction volume. All the positive amplifi cations by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specifi c RT-LAMP assay were achieved in less than 40 min. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specifi c RT-LAMP assay targets only the HA gene, so this RT-LAMP method has diffi culty with the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses which have HA genes that are diffi cult to amplify even by rRT-PCR. This may be a limitation of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specifi c RT-LAMP method. This limitation could be overcome by combining the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specifi c RT-LAMP assay with conventional RT-PCR for the matrix gene of infl uenza A virus (WHO 2009a ) or by designing infl uenza A virus consensus RT-LAMP assay primers and performing the two RT-LAMP assays together. Based on above facts and data, there is an urgent need for the development of an easy, accurate, and simple method for the diagnosis of this novel pandemic virus (Lee et al. 2010 ) . Lee et al. ( 2010 ) developed M-specifi c reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation for detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Based on validation by virus isolation, the specifi city and sensitivity of this M-specifi c RT-LAMP assay were 100 % and 98.25 %, respectively. A newly emerged pandemic human infl uenza virus 2009 which is a triple reassortant including segments from swine, avian, and human infl uenza viruses (Garten et al. 2009 ; Shinde et al. 2009 ; Smith et al. 2009 ) has spread throughout the world. Kubo et al. ( 2010 ) developed an HA-specifi c LAMP assay for the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus with 100 % specifi city and 97.8 % sensitivity. This method was also considered as a novel molecular method for diagnosis of pandemic infl uenza in resource-limited settings.",

It is very important to differentiate CMV retinitis from HSV and VZV retinitis early in the course of infection because the therapeutic agent to be used for treatment differs from virus to virus (Madhavan et al. 2004 ). So LAMP assay was developed for their differentiation. Reddy et al.

Besides being cumbersome, it requires paired serum samples and therefore cannot give an early diagnosis. In 2006, Toriniwa and Komiya standardized RT-LAMP for the rapid detection and quantifi cation of JEV by targeting the E gene, but still the application of this novel gene amplifi cation system for the clinical diagnosis of JE patients during epidemic situations needs to be established through evaluation with a large number of clinical samples (Toriniwa and Komiya 2006 ) .

            "text": "Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne fl avivirus and the most widely prevalent arbovirus in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America (Gubler 1997 ) . Four distinct serotypes, i.e., DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4, produce a spectrum of illness ranging from in apparent infection to moderate febrile illness and severe, fatal hemorrhagic disease. The three basic methods routinely practiced by most laboratories are virus isolation, characterization, detection of dengue virus-specifi c antibodies, and detection of genomic sequences by nucleic acid amplifi cation techniques (Guzman and Kouri 1996 ; Innis et al. 1989 ; WHO 1997 ) . Both virus isolation and PRNT assays are time-consuming and tedious and require more than a week for completion. Several investigators have reported on fully automatic real-time PCR assays for the detection of dengue virus in acute-phase serum samples (Callahan et al. 2001 ; Houng et al. 2001 ; Laue et al. 1999 ; Seah et al. 1995 ) . During the past decade, various nucleic acid amplifi cation techniques such as RT-PCR, nested PCR, Taqman real-time RT-PCR, SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR, and NASBAs have been developed for the rapid identifi cation of dengue virus to the serotype level with more accuracy (Kuno 1998 ; Lanciotti et al. 1992 ; Morita et al. 1991 ; Seah et al. 1995 ; Sudiro et al. 1997 ) . Magnitude of amplifi cation can be obtained easily by these PCR-based methods, but they require either highprecision instruments for the amplifi cation or elaborate methods for detection of the amplifi ed products. In addition, these methods are often cumbersome to adapt to routine clinical use, especially in peripheral health care settings and private clinics. Parida et al. ( 2005 ) developed RT-LAMP assay for reducing time required for the confi rmation of the detection of dengue virus. LAMP assay detects dengue virus within 30 min only (less than 1 h), whereas RT-PCR requires 3-4 h for same detection. Also it was found to be 10-to 100-fold more sensitive than RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.1-1.0 PFU of virus.",

The virus infects the dorsal root ganglia after primary infection, and its reactivation leads to shingles (zoster) in older individuals. In 1995, universal varicella immunization was started in the United States with VZV Oka (vOka strain) vaccine. Molecular analysis of the VZV genome (obtained from vesicular regions) used to discriminate the vOka strains and wild-type strains was based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the viral genomes from isolated viruses (La Russa et al. 1992 ) . But this method had limited general clinical use because the virus had to be isolated from the vesicular region. PCR methods were used to overcome this problem, PCR which can detect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations in open reading frame 38 (ORF38), ORF54, and ORF62 had been developed to distinguish the vOka and wild-type strains (Argaw et al. 2000 ; Quinlivan et al. 2005 ) . Higashimoto et al. ( 2008 ) developed LAMP method to distinguish between the varicellazoster virus (VZV) vaccine (vOka) strain and wildtype strains. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (nucleotide [nt] 105705 for VR-1 VZV LAMP and nt 106262 for VR-2 VZV LAMP) located in the open reading frame 62 gene were selected as LAMP targets. The detection limits of both LAMP methods were 100 copies per reaction, which is higher than that of the previously reported VZV LAMP method (Okamoto et al. 2004 ) , and also this method can detect viral DNA directly from swab samples without need of DNA extraction.",

So a sensitive, accessible, reliable, cost-effective, and fast diagnostic method is in demand to control PLMVd spread and the production of healthy and of high-quality propagation material. Boubourakas et al. ( 2009 ) developed an RT-LAMP protocol for the detection of PLMVd with a detection limit of 10 \u22125 . RT-LAMP products were confi rmed for the presence of corresponding sequences of the selected target by subjecting a portion of the amplifi ed products to the restriction enzyme analysis (Kubota et al. 2008 ) . Tsutsumi et al. ( 2010 ) developed RT-LAMP for the detection of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd-S). Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is a species of the genus Pospiviroid in the family Pospiviroidae that occurs in China (He et al. 1987 ) , Europe, and so on. PSTVd infects potatoes ( Solanum tuberosum ), tomatoes ( Lycopersicon esculentum ), and other Solanum spp. (Singh 1973 ) . PSTVd causes stunting, smaller and elongated tubers, and yield losses of potatoes (Pfannenstiel and Slack 1980 ) . The occurrence of PSTVd has not been recorded in Japan, except a temporary occurrence in a greenhouse in Fukushima Prefecture in 2008. As a result of investigation of its cause, it could be thought to originate from imported tomato seeds. Sensitivity for PSTVd-S was determined from extracted DNA of infected potato leaf and serially diluted up to 10 \u22124 times with sterilized water. It was possible to detect PSTVd from the extracted total nucleic acid diluted 10 \u22123 in RT-LAMP method and diluted to 10 \u22122 times in RT-PCR method. RT-LAMP method was ten times higher sensitive than RT-PCR method. Nie ( 2005 ) developed reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation of DNA for the detection of potato virus Y. Coat protein (CP) gene was selected for designing the primers in such a way that a loop could be formed and elongated during DNA amplifi cation. LAMP assay was found to be 10-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR.",

A soilborne pathogen, i.e., wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), was the causal agent responsible behind this disease, and it is transmitted by the fungus-like organism polymyxa graminis ( Inouye 1969 ) . Several common methods were used to detect WYMV, and ELISA was found as a reliable and suitable method for detecting high-throughput WYMV (Hariri et al. 1996a , b ; Geng et al. 2003 ) , but the sensitivity of ELISA might not be suffi ciently high to detect low concentrations of WYMV; plus virus-specifi c antiserum is required for ELISA assay. Zhang et al. ( 2011 ) developed RT-LAMP as a rapid detection method for wheat yellow mosaic virus. RT-LAMP could detect WYMV from total RNA diluted up to 10 \u22125 , while RT-PCR detected only up to 10 \u22123 . So, RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive than conventional reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",

They cause enteric or respiratory tract infections in a variety of animals including humans, livestock, and pets. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV. CoV-based vectors have potential in vaccine development and for gene therapy (Theil 2007 ) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) fi rst spread in Guangdong Province, China in November 2002 (Zhong et al. 2003 ) . SARS is diagnosed by two major approaches: fi rst, detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV was a sensitive and specifi c diagnostic approach, but seroconversion can be detected only around after day 10 of illness (Peiris et al. 2003a ) . In contrast, PCR-based tests have been shown to be useful for early SARS diagnosis (Berger et al. 2004 ) . Quantitative PCR approaches are a powerful tool for identifying SARS-CoV early after disease onset (Drosten et al. 2003 ; Poon et al. 2003 ; Ng et al. 2003 ; Grant et al. 2003 ) . Because of the requirement of sophisticated instrumentation and expensive reagents, these rapid molecular tests might not be the method of choice in fi eld situations. The detection limit of the assay was 10 copies/reaction, and positive signals were consistently observed in reactions containing ~50 copies of the target sequence. Quantitative PCR method was used for SARS diagnosis . Thai et al. ( 2004 ) developed a one-step, single-tube, accelerated, real-time, quantitative RT-LAMP assay for the early and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV. The sensitivity and specifi city of RT-LAMP assay for detecting viral RNA in clinical specimens with regard to RT-PCR were 100 and 87 %, respectively. The RT-LAMP assay was found to be 100-fold more sensitive than RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.01 PFU in clinical samples. In addition, by using a real-time RT-LAMP assay, the quantitation of virus concentration in the clinical sample is possible, which will indicate the early stage of the virus infection as well as potential source transmitters. However, the detection rates for SARS in the LAMP assay are similar to those with our conventional PCR-based assays . Rapid detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus by a loopmediated isothermal amplifi cation assay was developed by Poon et al. ( 2004 ) . The detection limit of the assay was 10 copies/reaction reactions containing ~50 copies of the target sequence. Viral load peaks in the second week of infection in SARS patients due to which its detection is diffi cult. LAMP assay is an inexpensive and accurate alternative method for detection of virus at the end of fi rst week of infection (Peiris et al. 2003b ) .",

Pseudorabies virus causes Aujeszky's disease in pigs and is extensively studied as a model for basic processes during lytic herpesvirus infection. Bovine herpesvirus-1 causes bovine infectious rhinotracheitis and pustular vulvovaginitis. The avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus is phylogenetically different from these two viruses. A large variety of infl uenza A viruses infect wild aquatic birds. Major economic losses in poultry production are due to highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (HPAIV) which also threatens human health. For rapid AIV detection, new assays would be designed that can be carried out with a minimum of specifi c equipment as compared to conventional methods. Although RT-LAMP was markedly more vulnerable to reduce the detection limits because of strain-specifi c sequence variation than subtype-specifi c real-time RT-PCR. Because of simplicity, LAMP proves to be a promising technology for AIV diagnosis (Notomi et al. 2000 ; Parida et al. 2008 ). Real-time RT-PCR also represents the gold standard for AIV RNA detection as it is considerably more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR (Pasick 2008 ). All RNA samples tested specifi cally positive in the realtime RT-LAMP were also assayed for sensitivity and compared with real-time RT-PCR. All AIVtargeted RT-LAMP assays developed so far have been compared with conventional RT-PCR, and sensitivity was calculated on the basis of infectivity, not taking into account the amount of RNA copies (Chen et al. 2008 ; Imai et al. 2006 Imai et al. , 2007 Jayawardena et al. 2007 ). Chen et al. ( 2010 ) diagnosed H9 avian infl uenza virus by using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation with a detection limit of ten copies per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses including H5N1, H3N2 subtype of AIV, and Newcastle disease virus. Again in 2011 , Nagatani et al. detected RNA of infl uenza virus by reverse transcription LAMP using a USBpowered portable potentiostat. Xie et al. ( 2010 ) developed an assay for rapid detection of infectious laryngotracheitis virus isolates. LAMP assay was found ten-fold more sensitive than the routine PCR assay, with a detection limit of 46 copies per reaction. Gunimaladevi et al. ( 2004 ) developed LAMP method for detection of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) in rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) with a ten-fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional nested PCR.",

Among known two types of PCV, porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) does not cause disease, but porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) causes a new emerging and multifactorial disease in swine known as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) (Bolin et al. 2001 ) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) syndrome is responsible for great losses to the pig industry. PCV2 is a non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA virus. Presence of PCR inhibitors (including organic and inorganic substances such as detergents, antibiotics, phenolic compounds, enzymes, polysaccharides, fats, proteins, and salts) in the analysis of real biological samples limits the usefulness of PCR. These inhibitors reduce the amplifi cation effi ciency (Darwich et al. 2002 ; Guo et al. 2010 ) . PCV2 was detected by reverse transcription LAMP using membrane protein M gene for primers with a detection limit ten fold greater than conventional PCR ). Chen et al. ( 2008 ) detected PCV2 by LAMP by using only four primers, while Zhao et al. ( 2011 ) detected same virus by effi cient LAMP assay using six primers including two loop primers for detection of target ORF2 gene in PCV2 (which encodes Rep protein that is involved in virus replication) with a detection limit of 10 copies, whereas the limit by conventional PCR was 1,000 copies. LAMP assay had advantages in specifi city, selectivity, and rapidity over other nucleic acid amplifi cation methods (Mori et al. 2006 ) . LAMP had been further advanced by using forward loop primers (Nagamine et al. 2002 ) . The LAMP assay developed had a detection limit of ten copies for PCV2, which was 100-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR. Rovira et al. ( 2009 ) developed reverse transcription LAMP for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus detection . The limit of detection ranged between 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22124 (50 % tissue culture infective) dose/ml. Swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is a kind of single-stranded RNA virus, which produces villous atrophy and enteritis, leading to the serious fi nancial loss to the whole pig industry. The traditional detection methods including virus isolation, virus immunodiagnostic assays, and PCR tests have shortcomings such as precise instruments requirement, demand of elaborate result analysis, high cost, and long detection time, which prevent these methods from being widely used (Reynolds and Garwes 1979 ; Rodak et al. 2005 ; Denac et al. 1997 ; Paton et al. 1997 ) . TGEV can be detected by using loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation with the detection limit of about 10 pg RNA which is ten times more sensitive than that of PCR and having no cross-reaction with other viruses ) and found that the most conserved fragment of 187 bp was found in the nucleocapsid protein gene which showed highly homology among different TGEV strains/isolates (more than 97 %) and low homology among other similar viruses (less than 52.5 %). LAMP could not only qualitatively detect the TGEV but also quantitatively analyze the virus. It was concluded that real-time fl uorescence LAMP for quantitatively detection of TGEV was established by adding 1X SYBR Green I in the LAMP reaction.",

Pham et al. ( 2005 ) developed loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation for rapid detection of Newcastle disease virus. The detection limit of both methods, i.e., PCR as well as LAMP, was 0.5 pg or 9 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ reaction determined by using a serial ten-fold dilution of the plasmids. Parida et al. ( 2004 ) developed real-time reverse transcription LAMP method for rapid detection of West Nile virus by using envelope gene of West Nile (WN) virus. Suebsing et al. ( 2011 ) developed reverse transcription LAMP method for detection of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus in Oncorhynchus keta . The limit of detection was 0.01 fg of RNA extracted from IHNV-infected CHSE-214 cells, compared with 1.0 fg for nested RT-PCR. Ren and Li ( 2011 ) developed reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplifi cation for rapid detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Six primers were designed to amplify the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PEDV. The optimal reaction condition for RT-LAMP amplifying PEDV N gene was achieved at 63 \u00b0C for 50 min. It was found that RT-LAMP assay was more sensitive than gel-based RT-PCR and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. It was capable of detecting PEDV from clinical samples and differentiating PEDV from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine rotavirus, porcine pseudorabies virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and avian infectious bronchitis virus. Taura syndrome virus (TSV) was fi rst discovered in Ecuador in 1992 (Jimenez 1992 ) . Kiatpathomchai et al. ( 2007 ) developed a rapid and sensitive detection of Taura syndrome virus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation. The detection of TSV using RT-LAMP was ten times more sensitive than the RT-PCR, but less sensitive than nested RT-PCR. Sappat et al. ( 2011 ) detected the shrimp Taura syndrome virus by loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation using a designed portable multichannel turbidimeter. When using the same TSV-RNA template sets, the results revealed the same detection limit of 10 \u22126 dilution for RT-LAMP when performed using a commercial heating block (Major Science, Taiwan) and the designed turbidimeter. When RT-LAMP reactions were carried out at 63 \u00b0C for 30 min using 2 \u03bcl of the ten-fold serially diluted RNA template extracted from TSV-infected shrimp, the turbidity measurement was able to detect 100 fg of total RNA. This detection limit was equivalent to that of RT-LAMP-AGE and nested RT-PCR. When the RNA in vitro transcript was used as the template, the detection limit by both of turbidity measurement and AGE was ten copies. A prior study indicated that the LAMP method was capable of amplifi cation starting with only six copies of template (Nagamine et al. 2002 ) . Xie et al. ( 2011 ) rapid detection of group I avian adenoviruses by a loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation. In total, 72 out of 184 cloacal swab samples from poultry were identifi ed as positive by LAMP, whereas 45 out of 184 were identifi ed as positive by conventional PCR test. Liu ( 2011 ) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation for the rapid detection of infectious bronchitis virus. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major cause of disease in domestic fowl and causes an acute, highly contagious disease of the respiratory tracts and sometimes urogential tracts (King and Cavanagh 1991 ) . The result indicated detection limit of IBV RT-LAMP was 10 copies/ tube. In addition, the reaction time of RT-LAMP method is 45 min, which is more rapid than conventional RT-PCR, and the reaction only needs a laboratory water bath. Kiatpathomchai et al. ( 2007 ) detected RT-TSV RNA in P. vannamei (collected from shrimp farms) by LAMP assay, and the sensitivity of RT-LAMP appears to be ten times more than RT-PCR. Wang et al. ( 2011 ) detected infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in one simple step by reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplifi cation (RT-LAMP) and further identifi ed the very virulent strain from non-vvIBDVs with a simply post-amplifi cation restriction enzyme analysis. A set of two inner, two outer, and two loop primers were designed on the basis of sequence analysis to target the VP5 gene and showed great specifi city with no cross-reaction to the other common avian pathogens. Detection limit was determined by both color change inspection and agarose gel electrophoresis was 28 copies viral RNA, which was almost as sensitive as a real-time RT-PCR previously developed.",

Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus endemic in Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or fl ying foxes). Although bats appear to be unaffected by the virus, HeV can spread from fruit bats to horses, causing severe disease. Human infection results from close contact with the blood, body fl uids, and tissues of infected horses. HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogens, with high fatality rate in humans and horses. Current assays for HeV detection require complex instrumentation and are generally time-consuming. Analytical sensitivity and specifi city of the HeV-LAMP assay was equal to a TaqMan assay developed previously.",

            "text": "Compared with RT-PCR and real-time PCR, LAMP has the advantages of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity. The higher sensitivity and specifi city of the LAMP reaction is attributed to continuous amplifi cation under isothermal conditions employing six primers recognizing eight distinct regions of the target. Additionally, the higher amplifi cation effi ciency of the LAMP reaction yields large amounts of by-product (pyrophosphate ion) leading to a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture. Since the increase in turbidity of the reaction mixture-according to the production of precipitate-correlates with the amount of DNA synthesized, real-time monitoring of the LAMP reaction can be achieved by real-time measurement of turbidity. The LAMP assay has emerged as a powerful gene amplifi cation tool for the rapid identifi cation of microbial infections and is being increasingly used by various investigators for the rapid detection and typing of emerging viruses, including WNV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), dengue, and JEV. Changes in CD4+, CD8+, CD4+ CD8+ and immunoglobulin M-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndromeaffected pigs and age-matched uninfected wasted and healthy pigs correlate with lesions and porcine circovirus type 2 load in lymphoid tissues.
