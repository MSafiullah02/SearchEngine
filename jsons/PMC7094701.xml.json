The medical records and influenza notification forms of patients with detectable respiratory virus were reviewed, focusing on epidemiology, clinical manifestation, outcome, laboratory findings, and diagnosis of SARI. SARI was defined as a flu-like syndrome with signs of severity (dyspnea or oxygen saturation below 95%).",

He et al.8 analyzed a hospitalized pediatric population and found a prevalence of 48%, while Walker and Ison9 found a prevalence of 14% in a hospitalized adult population. This difference between age groups was observed in this study, emphasizing the greater vulnerability of children to this infection, probably as consequence of a more intense inflammatory process triggered by primary infection or by favorable anatomical conditions of the respiratory tract in younger children.",

However, since the development of molecular techniques to detect HRV, this virus has been the focus of the most recent studies in this field. Nowadays, HRV infections have been linked with exacerbations of chronic lung diseases and fatal pneumonia in patients at the extremes of age or with pre-existing comorbidities.4, 5 The importance of one study that evaluated the characteristics of HRV infections in a tertiary hospital is based on these new concerns. Marcone et al.10 reported a higher number of HRV infections in hospitalized children in Argentina when compared with pediatric outpatients with acute respiratory infection, demonstrating a scenario that contributed to the increased concern about HRV infection in the hospital setting.",

HRV infection is closely associated with comorbidities, mainly chronic lung diseases, and is an important factor in exacerbations of these underlying lung diseases. The colder seasons were the period with higher frequency of HRV infections in Southern Brazil, and therefore must be a period to warn clinicians about young age children affected by respiratory infections, especially those with comorbidities such as chronic lung disease.
