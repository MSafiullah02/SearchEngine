In Europe, Spain is unfortunately following Italy\u2019s curve, with 49,515 cases and 3647 deaths. Both countries have surpassed China\u2019s 3287 reported COVID-19 death toll. France and Germany are also facing a difficult situation, with more than 29,155 and 43,646 confirmed cases, respectively. All European countries have COVID-19 cases, and most countries have at least one death. However, there is a clear geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases in Europe, with central and southwest Europe being the most affected.
