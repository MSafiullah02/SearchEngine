Using molecular diagnostic tools, viruses can be detected in up to 80% of ARI in developed countries [2]. In developing countries, there is little information on the epidemiology and seasonal variability of respiratory viruses. Some of the few available studies on children with ARI in Africa found similarly high viral detection rates [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Regarding epidemiological differences between viral ARI patterns, climate factors have been extensively studied for influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). For influenza viruses, higher incidence has been associated with cold and dry climate in temperate regions, compared to higher incidence in warm and humid climate in some tropical regions [8]. These conditions may not uniformly favour a higher incidence of all respiratory viruses, as for RSV, higher incidence has been associated with cold and humid conditions in temperate settings [9]. For other respiratory viruses, very limited information exists on differences between tropical and temperate regions. This is partly because methodological differences limit the comparability of data regarding detection rates, composition of circulating viruses, and seasonality of detection.",

In Ghana, nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were collected from outpatients with ARI, during February 2008 to February 2009 at the Child Welfare Clinic of the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, Ashanti region. The Agogo hospital is the referral hospital of the Asante Akim North district of the Ashanti region of Ghana and sees about 6000 patients per year. Specimens were stored in previously prepared individual aliquots of RNAlater stabilizing solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) until processing within the same day at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine. In Germany, nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were taken from inpatients with ARI at the University Paediatric Hospital, Bonn, during November 2007 to December 2008 and processed within 24 h at the Institute of Virology, Bonn University Medical Centre. The University Paediatric Hospital, Bonn sees about 3000 inpatients per year.",

Assay sensitivity and specificity were evaluated on photometrically quantified in vitro transcribed cRNA/DNA controls generated from cloned PCR amplicons containing the respective genomic target sites as described previously [19]. In Ghana, multiplex reactions were used to identify Flu A and Flu B, as well as RSV and hMPV, without the possibility of distinguishing individual viruses due to limited resources. RSV and hMPV are genetically related and constitute the Paramyxoviridae subfamily Pneumovirinae; from hereon they are referred to as pneumoviruses. Enveloped viruses under study included Flu A/B, pneumoviruses, hPiV1\u20134 and hCoVs. Non-enveloped viruses included EV, RhV and AdV.",

In Germany, the next most frequently detected viruses were RhVs (n = 63; 11.7%), AdVs (n = 48; 8.9%), hPiVs1\u20134 (n = 41; 7.6%), EVs (n = 36; 6.7%), hCoVs (n = 31; 5.8%) and Flu A/B (n = 22; 4.1%). RhVs, pneumoviruses, AdVs and EVs occurred more frequently in patients with ARI in Germany than in Ghana with PRMH of 1.6 (95% CI 1.2\u20132.2), 1.8 (95% CI 1.4\u20132.2), 2.6 (95% CI 1.7\u20133.9) and 3.0 (95% CI 1.8\u20135.0), respectively. PRs for individual viruses were comparable among age groups, except for EVs, where the strongest differences between study sites were observed in children aged 2 years (PR 9.7, 95% CI 2.7\u201335.2). In summary, no virus occurred more frequently in Ghana than in Germany at statistically significant PRs. Pneumoviruses afforded the majority of detections, whereas other viruses differed in prevalence between sites. Detection rates for all viruses and cohorts are listed in Table 1\n.",

For the well-investigated virus Flu A, cold weather and low humidity probably favour transmission and incidence (summarized in ref. [22]). Additionally, a preferential transmission of Flu A by aerosol in temperate climates has been hypothesized, in contrast to predominant transmission by contact in the tropics [23]. Because Flu A/B detection rates were similar between Germany and Ghana, climatic conditions may have favoured incidence in Germany to a similar extent to the increased contact in Ghana. Contact-mediated transmission in crowded households during the tropical rainy season may also cause a higher incidence of RSV [24]. This is in line with our observation that the detection rate of pneumoviruses in Ghana peaked only in the second of two rainy seasons, coinciding with a higher rainfall at that time compared with the first rainy season. Increased transmission of pneumoviruses probably also contributed to the high number of pneumovirus detections during the German winter. Finally, the environmental stability of non-enveloped picornaviruses did not seem to correlate with an expected importance of these viruses as causes of ARI in the tropics [22].",

In particular, the 43.2% rate in Ghana was lower than that in the few previous African studies using similar methodologies. However, strong region-specific and time-specific differences may exist in tropical ARI virus patterns. Examples for different viruses predominating in African studies include RhVs in a study from South Africa (37% of all virus detections; conducted during 2009\u201312) [6], hPiV1\u20133 and RhVs in Nigeria (35% each; 2009) [25], Flu A/B/C in Cameroon (28%; 2009) [3] and AdVs in Senegal (22%; 2012/13) [5]. Furthermore, African patient collectives may differ, for instance, based on the rate of underlying conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection [6]. HIV prevalence in Ghana is 1.5%, whereas that of other African study sites yielding higher overall virus detection rates ranges from 0.5% (Senegal) to 18.9% (South Africa) [26]. The lower virus detection rate in Ghana compared with other African studies is therefore unlikely to be the result of HIV co-infection alone.",

In Ghana, specimens were collected from outpatients, whereas in Germany, specimens were collected from inpatients. We therefore cannot exclude that German inpatients may have presented with more severe ARI compared with Ghanaian outpatients, and that this may have influenced virus spectra and detection rates. This would be consistent with the higher pneumovirus detection rate in Germany. Unfortunately, we could not compare ARI severity between our sites. However, a previous study from our groups investigating Ghanaian inpatients with ARI yielded a pneumovirus detection rate of 14% [27]. This was near-identical to the 13% pneumovirus detection rate in Ghanaian outpatients in the present study. Altogether, these data speak against a major bias from cohort composition, suggesting that the German and Ghanaian cohorts can be compared regarding their ARI epidemiological patterns. Of note, we cannot exclude that only Ghanaian parents living in close proximity to the outpatient clinic or with children experiencing more severe disease sought medical attention, hence explaining the similar pneumovirus detection rates in Ghanaian inpatients and outpatients. This hypothesis is supported by previous work from our groups showing that travel distance to medical institutions significantly affects health care utilization in rural Ghana [28].",
