In the fi eld of virology, the Y2H system has signifi cantly increased our knowledge of structure and function of viral proteins by systematically assessing intraviral protein interactions. Several comprehensive approaches to determine virus-host interactions have provided insight into viral strategies to manipulate the host for effi cient replication and to escape host-derived countermeasures. To expand our knowledge of intraviral and virus-host protein interactions, we here present a Y2H protocol that is well suited for high-throughput screening. Yeast mating followed by liquid handling in a 96-well format as well as fl uorescent readout of the reporter system provides a highly standardized and fully automated screening situation. The protocol can either be applied to screen complex host cDNA libraries or protein pairs arrayed for cross-testing. The ease of use, the cost-effectiveness as well as the robotic handling allows for extensive and multiple rounds of screening providing high coverage of protein-protein interactions. Thus, this protocol represents an improved \"deep\" screening method for high-throughput Y2H assays.",

Large-scale analysis, however, revealed that the Y2H system is comparable in specifi city to other assays detecting binary protein interactions [ 4 -6 ] . Clearly however, the screening protocol is instrumental in providing suffi cient sensitivity: (1) To ensure a \"deep\" screening situation, all proteins potentially interacting have to be exposed to each other in pairwise combinations. High-quality complex cDNA libraries enhance the screening success [ 3 ] . Alternatively, large ORF collections like the Mammalian Gene Collection ( http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/ ) have been generated based on whole genome sequencing and subsequent recombinational cloning of all genes of a particular organism. Collections of this size and complexity can be screened either in batch procedures or by cross-testing of all potential protein interactions using arrays. (2) Classically, bait and prey proteins are tagged at their amino-terminal end with the bait fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the prey fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activator. Fusion of tags to the carboxy-terminal end of a bait or a prey as well as testing of a given protein both as bait and prey fusion, allows for more refi ned screening [ 7 , 8 ] .",

Preys that are found very often while screening different baits, are probably \"sticky,\" that is to say they may interact with other proteins in a nonphysiological manner and should be excluded from the evaluation as likely-false positives [ 3 ] , while frequently identifi ed bait proteins may partially self-activate the reporter system. Next, high-confi dence data sets are subjected to computational analysis ( see Friedel, Chapter 8 of this series). Database searches are performed to generate virus-host protein interactomes which are then connected to other high-throughput screens such as RNAi screens ( see Griffi ths, Chapter 5 of this series).

While most of these methods are of limited use in high-throughput applications either because the method is rather time-consuming, costly or requires extensive optimization on the level of a single protein pair, the LUMIER assay [ 9 ] has been adapted for high-throughput analysis ( see Blasche and Koegl, Chapter 2 of this series). In brief, this assay is based on co-expression of two proteins in mammalian cells: while the bait protein is tagged by the protein A-or Flag-tag and used to immobilize the complex, the co-isolated interacting prey protein is detected via the enzymatic activity of its luciferase fusion partner. Most importantly, like the Y2H system, the LUMIER assay primarily detects binary interactions, provides high confi rmation rates and thus represents the best method of choice to validate Y2H interactions.",

Since these two strategies are rather complementary than confi rmatory, they are well suited to increase the coverage of interactomes. Individual proteins are fused to ProtA-, FLAG-, or GFP-tag to serve as baits for the isolation of protein complexes the composition of which is subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry ( see Rowles et al., Chapter 4 of this series). While functional tagging in the chromosomal context is still not feasible for higher eukaryotic proteins, the BAC technology which is available for numerous virus systems allows for genomic tagging of viral genes and thus their use in affi nity purifi cation of virus-host protein complexes. This way, PPIs of a particular viral protein can be investigated at different timepoints of viral infection and upon infection of various cell systems. Most importantly, in case of viral genes with relevance for the infection cycle, the functional integrity of the viral fusion product can easily be assessed. A powerful combination of the Y2H system and affi nity-isolation of protein complexes has recently been presented for four tumor virus families (the papilloma viruses, the polyoma viruses, the herpesviruses, and the adenoviruses) providing high stringency virus-host interactomes [ 24 ] .",

Here we present a Gal4-Y2H protocol that is well suited for high-throughput screening of intraviral as well as virus-host protein interactions. This method not only allows for simple and cost-effective screening. In particular, it can be fully automated and performed using a liquid handling robot and thus enables screening of extensive bait and prey combinations as well as multiple rounds of library screenings, thereby overcoming major drawbacks of the Y2H system. Thus, this protocol represents an improved \"deep\" screening method for high-throughput robotic Y2H assays.",

Haploid yeast strains of opposing mating type carrying either bait or prey vectors are propagated under selective conditions in synthetic minimal medium lacking Tryptophane (SD-W) or Leucine (SD-L), respectively. The mating process to gain diploid cells containing both bait and prey vector is performed in complete medium (YPDA + 20 % Polyethyenglycol) under gentle shaking. Afterwards, the yeast culture is spread on 96-well microtiter plates (MTP) and incubated under selective conditions (SD-L/W). The reporter gene activity is then examined in SD medium lacking additionally Histidine (SD-L/W/H) and supplemented with 4-Methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-D -galactopyranoside (4-MUx) and 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT ) in a fl uorescence plate reader (excitation 365 nm, emission 448 nm). The interaction of the bait protein fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain with a prey protein fused to the Gal4 activation domain leads to reconstitution of the Gal4 transcription factor and subsequently expression of HIS3 and MEL1 reporter genes. The reporter genes allow growth in a Histidine-free environment as well as the hydrolysis of 4-MUx to fl uorescent Methylumbelliferone, whose fl uorescent activity is a measure of protein-protein interaction. The optimal 3-AT concentration as a competitive inhibitor to leaky reporter gene HIS3 expression was defi ned in a previously performed prescreen.",

For this purpose, 25 \u00b5L of each bait and prey culture is added to 100 \u00b5L YPDA and the MTP is gently centrifuged (1 min, 180 \u00d7 g ) to collect the yeast cells at the bottom of the wells. Incubate over night. 4. To select for diploid yeasts, transfer 15 \u00b5L of mating plate to a fresh MTP (F-bottom) with 150 \u00b5L SD-L/W medium and incubate for 2 days. Add the positive control to the designated well at this step. 5. To monitor the reporter gene activity, the diploid yeasts are then divided onto fi ve different MTPs (F-bottom). 10 \u00b5L each 3.1 Array-Based Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening are transferred to 150 \u00b5L SD-L/W/H medium containing 50 \u00b5M 4-Methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-D -galactopyranoside (4-MUx) and increasing concentrations of 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) (typically 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 mM) as competitive inhibitor of the leaky expression of the HIS3 reporter gene. Also, 10 \u00b5L are used to inoculate 150 \u00b5L SD-L/W medium for growth control. All MTPs are incubated for 3 days. 6. The MTP with SD-L/W is controlled by eye for yeast growth. If there is no detection of growth in some wells, the corresponding wells of the SD-L/W/H MTPs cannot be analyzed. 7. The SD-L/W/H MTPs are then analyzed for reporter gene activity in a fl uorescence plate reader (excitation 365 nm, The array-based yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening allows the cross-testing of a single protein against a defi ned set of possible interaction partners. The haploid yeast strain carrying the bait vector is propagated under selective conditions in synthetic minimal medium lacking Tryptophane (SD-W), while yeast cells of opposing mating type transformed with the various prey vectors are grown arrayed in 96-well microtiter plates (MTP) in SD medium lacking Leucine (SD-L). The combination of the bait yeast strain with the multiple prey strains in complete medium (YPDA) over night leads to mating, resulting in diploid cells carrying both bait and prey vectors, which are selected by growth in SD-L/W medium. The reporter gene activity is examined in SD medium lacking additionally Histidine (SD-L/W/H) and supplemented with 4-Methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-Dgalactopyranoside (4-MUx) and 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) in a fl uorescence plate reader (excitation 365 nm, emission 448 nm). The interaction of the bait protein fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain with the prey protein fused to Gal4 activation domain leads to the reconstitution of Gal4 transcription factor and subsequently expression of HIS3 and MEL1 reporter genes. Expression of the reporter genes allows growth in a Histidine-free environment as well as the hydrolysis of 4-MUx to fl uorescent methylumbelliferone, whose fl uorescent activity is a measure of protein-protein interaction. Usually 3-AT is added in increasing concentration as competitive inhibitor of the leaky expression of the HIS3 reporter gene emission 448 nm). While the gene product of HIS3 permits growth in Histidine-free medium, the \u03b1-Galactosidase encoded by MEL1 catalyzes hydrolysis of 4-MuX to fl uorescent methylumbelliferone. 8. The resulting data is analyzed by comparing the relative fl uorescence intensity of each bait/prey-pair to the negative controls (empty vectors). For this, the relative fl uorescence units (RFU) for all 3-AT concentrations of each protein pair are plotted on a bar diagram and compared to the values produced by expression of each bait or prey with the respective empty vector ( see Note 7 ). The values of the positive control help to ease the interpretation of results. Cutoff values for positive interactions are usually defi ned individually for each bait, as RFU values tend to take a broad range in between the individual tested proteins.",

Now the mated yeasts are divided onto seven MTPs (F-bottom) with increasing 3-AT concentration (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 50 mM). First, transfer 200 \u00b5L each to an MTP without any 3-AT (0 mM plate).

Repeat this pipetting scheme until all seven plates contain cells in SD-L/W/H medium with 50 \u00b5M 4-MuX and the respective 3-AT concentration ( see Note 11 ). 10. Stack the MTPs, cover the topmost with self-adhesive foil and wrap the stack in plastic foil. Incubate for 6 days at 30 \u00b0C. 11. To monitor the mating effi ciency, divide the cfu/mL of diploids by cfu/mL of the limiting partner (the strain which yielded the fewest viable cells). Multiply with 100 to obtain the mating effi ciency in percent. The mating effi ciency should lie between 2 and 5 %. 12.
