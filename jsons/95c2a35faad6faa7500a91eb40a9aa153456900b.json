Much attention has been paid to the virus's virology, pathogenesis and spread. In contrast, little effort has been aimed at identifying influenza's social origins. In this article, I review H5N1's phylogeographic properties, including mechanisms for its evolving virulence. The novel contribution here is the attempt to integrate these with the political economies of agribusiness and global finance. Particular effort is made to explain why H5N1 emerged in southern China in 1997. It appears the region's reservoir of near-human-specific recombinants was subjected to a phase change in opportunity structure brought about by China's newly liberalized economy. Influenza, 200 nm long, seems able to integrate selection pressures imposed by human production across continental distances, an integration any analysis of the virus should assimilate in turn.",

The outbreak fizzles out, but 2 months later a 3year-old boy dies of the same strain, identified as a highly pathogenic version of influenza A (H5N1). Officials are shocked. This appears the first time such a strain has jumped the species barrier and killed a human. Shocking too, the outbreak proves persistent. In November a 6-year-old is infected, recovering. Two weeks later, a teenager and two adults are infected. Two of the three die. Fourteen additional infections rapidly follow.",

Internally, infected poultry are marked by lesions and hemorrhaging in the intestinal tract and the trachea, with blood discharge from the beak and cloaca.

The following year H5N1 again reemerged, this time with a vengeance. The Z genotype that surfaced as the dominant recombinant spread across China, into Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Korea, Japan, and Malaysia. Two additional strains would subsequently materialize. Since 2005 the Qinghai-like strain (H5N1 hemagglutinin clade 2.2) has spread across Eurasia, as far west as England, and into Africa (Salzberg et al 2007) .

There is now, in addition, greater integration of stockbreeding, aquaculture and horticulture, a burgeoning live-bird market system, and widespread proximity to poultry (Cristalli and Capua 2007; Gilbert et al in press) . Rural landscapes of many of the poorest countries are now characterized by unregulated agribusiness pressed against periurban slums (Fasina et al 2007; Guldin 1993) .

In a torrent rivaling the research conducted on the central mystery of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, thousands of reports have been published on the virus's molecular structure, genetics, virology, pathogenesis, host biology, clinical course, treatment, modes of transmission, phylogenetics, and geographic spread. That body of work, much of it riveting, appears predicated on a molecular narrative that portrays disease largely in terms of a conflict between virion and immunity, between viral evolution and humanity's capacity to produce adequate vaccines and antivirals, between nature red in glycoprotein and nurture white in lab coat (Braun 2007) . Paradigms compete and in investing in one narrative-perhaps because of its political, commercial or institutional benefits-other explanations suffer. Some of the most basic questions about bird flu's nature appear lost in the blizzard of micrographs, sequence alignments, tertiary solution structures, SIR models, antigenic cartograms, and phylogenetic dendrograms. What of the virus's greater context? Castree (2008a Castree ( , 2008b recently reviewed a new literature aimed at addressing just such context. The literature, at this point largely a loose affiliation of case studies, tracks the ways the present class of models of globalized finance and production, which structure so much of humanity's daily life, are embodied in the control and exploitation of nonhuman systems. The work traces the means by which nature is \"neoliberalized\". To Castree's examples-water management, fisheries, logging, mining, plant and animal genomics, and greenhouse gas emissions-we can add agriculture, breeding programs, and pharmaceutical excavation. This article represents another example, although it travels along something of an orthogonal direction. I review influenza as a case study of the inadvertent biotic fallout of efforts aimed at steering animal ontogeny and ecology to multinational profitability (Benton 1989) .",

In the context of a now-globalized poultry, I will next explore a fundamental question so far ill-addressed, surprisingly so given the amount of work dedicated to characterizing the virus: why did pathogenic H5N1 evolve in southern China? Moreover, why did it do so in 1997? Locating bird flu virulence in China's poultry intensification efforts is one matter. Outbreak persistence there and elsewhere, however, is another: I will also review complications in influenza epidemiology apparent beyond the factory gate. Finally, I will propose a broad albeit preliminary program of intervention that extends beyond the provisional fiddling typically operationalized during each outbreak season. Along the way I will pursue epistemological aspirations. In bridging disciplines, I aim for an evolutionary virology that integrates humanity's impact on pathogen evolution from the very start of any investigation.",

These outbreaks were typically low pathogenic, causing lesser damage to poultry. There was, however, an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 in Texas in 2002. A low pathogenic H6N2 outbreak in California, beginning in large farms outside San Diego, evolved greater virulence as it spread through California's Central Valley. Another outbreak worthy of note is that of a low pathogenic strain of H5N1 in Michigan in 2002. H5N1, then, has already invaded the United States in a less deadly form, and with different internal genes, telling us that the molecular identity of a strain is insufficient for defining the danger of any single outbreak. Low and high pathogenic strains must be distinguished otherwise. Some mechanism must transform low pathogenic strains into more virulent ones (and, we should hope, back again).",

What cannot be slowed down arrives earlier. It is likely then that, as was the case for the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, the main waves of the next human influenzas will sweep the planet earlier than the typical flu season, with swine flu (2009) as early as August this year or, if another strain, some terrible year in the near future (Cliff, Haggett and Ord 1986) .",

And in something of the other direction, there is the macabre sight of H5N1-devestated waterfowl, which typically act as the natural (and unharmed) reservoir for multiple H5 strains. Another explanation leans on a large modeling literature (reviewed by Dieckmann et al 2002; Ebert and Bull 2008) that hypothesizes a relationship between the rate of transmission and the evolution of virulence, the amount of damage a strain causes its host. Simply put, to start, there is a cap on pathogen virulence. Pathogens must avoid evolving the capacity to incur such damage to their hosts that they are unable to transmit themselves. If a pathogen kills its host before it infects the next host it destroys its own chain of transmission. But what happens when the pathogen \"knows\" that the next host is coming along much sooner? The pathogen can get away with being virulent because it can successfully infect the next susceptible in the chain before it kills its host. The faster the transmission rate, the lower the cost of virulence.",

But antibodies for H5N1 (2.5%) and H9N2 (4.9%) were also found among all tested, with a significantly greater prevalence of H9N2 antibodies (9.5%) in those occupationally exposed to birds. Wang, Fu and Zheng (2009) meanwhile detected very few cases of H5 among 2191 Guangzhou workers occupationally exposed to birds. H9, on the other hand, appeared widespread across the poultry commodity chain, especially among poultry market retailers (15.5%) and wholesalers (6.6%) and workers in large-scale poultry-breeding enterprises (5.6%). By way of explanation, H5 are targeted by vaccination campaigns, while H9 are generally not. Retailers handle different poultry species from multiple wholesalers, while wholesalers handle their own lots alone. Finally, Zhang et al (2008) followed H9N2 outbreaks over 5 years in a single broiler chicken operation in Shanghai. Virus across all outbreaks in the plant appeared related to that of the first outbreak despite vaccination efforts. The H9N2 isolates, with internal loci that arose via local reassortment with H5N1, showed evolution by antigenic drift across the study period.

At first glance one suffers a Latourian shock at how much the naked birds look like living groceries. Able to survive solely in warm climes, the chickens were developed in the interests of the producer, not the consumer. Consumers have long avoided plucking feathers, a step typically conducted at the factory. A featherless poultry will allow producers, on the other hand, to scratch off plucking from production. The bald bird offers the anatomical equivalent of the factory epidemiology agribusiness is imposing on poultry-generating artificial ecologies that could never persist in nature because of the disease costs they incur, but that allow more poultry to be processed faster. The resulting costs are shifted to the birds, of course, but also consumers, farm workers, taxpayers, local governments, and nearby wildlife.",

In the first chapter of the first volume of Capital Marx wrote that human-made objects have multiple characteristics. They have use value-a hammer can be used to beat down nails. In all human economies objects also sport an exchange value-how many other objects (say, screwdrivers) for which a hammer can be exchanged. A capitalist economy adds a third characteristic, turning objects into commodities. Surplus value is that part of the object's worth that accrues to capitalists as profit. Marx's contribution was showing that capitalists expropriate the surplus value by taking it out of the value that workers added to the commodity when they made it, usually by paying workers lower wages or increasing worker productivity, paying them the same or less for more work.",

But in these first efforts to better relate influenza's evolution to its social context we will address only the most general of Marx's points, namely that capitalists produce commodities not because commodities are useful-have use value-but because they accrue surplus value, to capitalists the most important characteristic of the object. Changing the color or style of a hammer to attract more consumers may seem negligible in effect, but for other objects changes in use value can have far-reaching, even dangerous, consequences. In this case, agribusiness has changed its commodity-living, breathing organisms-to maximize productivity. But what does it mean to change the use value of the creatures we eat? What happens when changing use value turns our poultry into plague carriers? Does out-of-season goose production, for instance, allow influenza strains to avoid seasonal extirpation, typically a natural interruption in the evolution of virulence? Are the resulting profits defensible at such a rapidly accruing cost?",

Unions are an important check on production practices that affect not only workers and consumers, but both directly and by proxy the animals involved in production. Third, vertical agribusiness acts as both poultry supplier and retailer. The CP Group, for instance, owns a number of fast food chains in a number of countries selling, what else, CP chicken.

With additional H5N1 samples from around southern China, Wang et al (2008) showed virus from the first outbreaks in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia appeared most related to isolates from Yunnan, another southern Chinese province. Indonesia's outbreaks were likely seeded by strains first isolated from Hunan Province. These are important results, showing the complexity of influenza's phylogeographic landscape. At the same time they need not absolve Guangdong. Even if some H5N1 strains emerged elsewhere in the region, Guangdong's socioeconomic centrality may have acted as an epidemiological attractant, drawing in novel poultrytrade-borne strains from around southern China before dispersing them again back out across China and beyond. Mukhtar et al (2007) meanwhile traced the origins of the genomic segments from the original 1996 outbreak in Guangdong. The internal proteins (encoding for proteins other than surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) appeared phylogenetically closest to those of H3N8 and H7N1 isolates sampled from Nanchang in nearby Jiangxi Province. The 1996 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase appeared closest to those of H5N3 and H1N1 isolates from Japan. In the months before the outbreak in Hong Kong several of the proteins were again replaced by way of reassortment, this time via strains of H9N2 and H6N1 (Guan et al 1999; Hoffmann et al 2000) . H5N1 strains in the years that followed Hong Kong emerged by still more reassortment (Li et al 2004) . The sociogeographic mechanisms by which the various segments first converged (and were repeatedly shuffled) in Guangdong remain to be better outlined. The results so far do indicate the spatial expanse over which reassortants originate may be greater than Kennedy Shortridge, or anyone else, previously imagined. But genomic origins tell us little how this particular complement led to a virus that locally evolved such virulence other than showing the genetic variation upon which the virus drew.",

Guangdong's poultry operations were by this point technically modernized for breeding, raising, slaughtering, and processing birds, and vertically integrated with feed mills and processing plants. AgFDI helped import grandparent genetic stock, support domestic breeding, and update nutrition feed milling/mixing (Rozelle, Pray and Huang 1999) .

Domestic producers in Hong Kong competed with Hong Kong-Guangdong joint ventures for export licenses (Zweig 1991) .

With so much domestic currency on hand, the coastal provinces could outcompete inland provinces for livestock and grain produced by the inland's own TVEs. The coastal provinces were able to cycle their competitive advantage by turning cheap grain into more profitable poultry or flat-out re-exporting the inland goods, accumulating still greater financial reserves. At one point rivalries became so intense that Hunan and Guangxi imposed trade barriers upon interprovincial trade. The central government's efforts to negotiate interprovincial rivalries included spreading liberalization inland (Tan and Khor 2006) . Provinces other than Guangdong and Fujian began to become entrained into market agriculture, albeit at a magnitude still outpaced by their coastal counterparts. Industrial poultry's expanding extent-by re-exporting and inland development-increases the geographic scope for H5N1's emergence and may explain the roles Yunnan and Hunan appear to have played in serving up H5N1 abroad.",

In engaging in internally imposed structural adjustment China has largely turned away from its real and ideological investment in the health and wellbeing of its population (Hart-Landsberg and Burkett 2005a). Tens of millions of state industrial workers have been laid off. Labor income as a share of Chinese GDP fell from about 50% in the 1980s to under 40% by 2000 (Li 2008) . FDI and private companies-under no obligation to offer housing, healthcare, or retirement benefits-are used to discipline Chinese workers who were long used to a living wage, basic benefits, and job protection (Hart-Landsberg and Burkett 2005b). Discipline, however, does not always take. Protests running now into the tens of thousands, some turning into riots requiring army deployment, have battered provincial governments accused of corruption, land confiscation, expropriating state assets, wage theft, and pollution. In something of an ironic twist, in defending foreign capital against its own people, China's communist leadership has taken on the role of the comprador class it first defeated in 1949 (Heartfield 2005) .",

By staking billions in public works and loans, the central government kept the country's economic engine primed in the face of slowing exports. Prophetically, 4 years previous, the government introduced fiscal austerity measures to cool off inflation and the possibility of an overheated economy. An associated regulation package was initiated to control the kind of short-term speculation that would soon strain China's regional neighbors. The central state maintains tight control over the macroeconomy, capital flows, and corporate structure even as it cedes much of the day-to-day operations to provincial authorities. Concomitantly, China's economy is more than export driven. Even as austerity leaves millions of Chinese destitute in its wake (Hart-Landsberg and Burkett 2005a), up until the past year's global contraction the domestic economy continued to grow, albeit increasingly dependent on luxury goods and real estate speculation. Finally, exports out of China were until the 1997 crisis largely destined for East and Southeast Asia. During the crisis's aftermath China redirected more of its trade to Europe, North America, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania. China, then, was able to maintain a trade surplus, retain foreign investment, and prop the yuan against the fiscal buffet from abroad.",

Satellite pictures show rice harvests matching duck densities. The more annual rice crops the more ducks (and the greater the association with H5N1 outbreaks). It seems these ducks, free to graze outdoors, exposed to migratory birds, and tolerant of a wider range of influenzas, serve as epidemiological conduits for infecting nearby poultry.

In Thailand alone there are closed-off farms, open structures with netting to block passerine birds, the aforementioned free-grazing ducks, and backyard poultry (Songserm et al 2006) . Even then, such a taxonomy implies a compartmentalization often absent in the field. On a recent trip to Lake Poyang in Jiangxi Province, China, an international team of experts discovered an astonishing farming ecology in which domesticated freerange ducks fed in fields, bathed in local estuaries, swam in the lake, and intermingled and presumably interbred with wild waterfowl. Some flocks daily commuted across dykes from their sheds to the open water and back again. The epidemiological implications are obvious. Indeed, the facility by which pathogens spread and evolve in the area is of an order that, according to local farmers, chickens cannot be raised around the lake.

For the past three decades, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have made loans to poorer countries conditioned on removing supports for domestic food markets. Small farmers cannot compete with cheaper corporate imports subsidized by the global North. Many farmers either give up for a life on periurban margins or are forced to contract out their services-their land, their labor-to livestock multinationals now free to move in (Lewontin 2007; Manning and Baines 2004) . The World Trade Organization's Trade-Related Investment Measures permit foreign companies, aiming to reduce production costs, to purchase and consolidate small producers in poorer countries (McMichael 2006) . Under informal contract, small farmers must purchase transnationalapproved supplies and are not always guaranteed their birds will be bought back by their transnational partner at fair market price or bought back at all (Delforge 2007). The new arrangements belie the superficial distinction that has been made between industrial farms exercising \"biosecurity\" on the one hand and small farmers whose flocks are exposed to the epidemiological elements. Factory farms ship day-old chicks to be raised piecework by contracted farmers. Once grown (and exposed to migratory birds), the birds are shipped back to the factory for processing. The violation of biosecurity appears built directly into the industrial model. A third complication is the historical shift in the relationship between nature and farming. Maps in Phongpaichit and Baker (1995) show since 1840 Thailand has been transformed from primary wilderness into an agricultural state, a veritable bread basket. Agriculture's new girth comes at the expense of wetlands worldwide, either out-and-out destroyed, polluted, or irrigated dry. The latter abuse serves as another basis for conflicts between agribusiness and small farmers. Socially stratified power struggles over the Chao Phraya basin have wracked Thailand for hundreds of years (Molle 2007) .",

The origins of highly pathogenic H5N1 are multifactorial, with many countries and industries and environmental sources at fault. Can we then place blame on the country, say, Indonesia or Vietnam or Nigeria, from which a human-to-human H5N1 infection might first emerge? Should we hold China accountable for repeatedly seeding outbreaks regionally and internationally? Should we broach Hong Kong's offshore farming? Or should we castigate the United States, where the industrial model of vertically integrated poultry first originated, with thousands of livestock packed in as so much food for flu? The answers are affirmative across the board. Responsibility, much as the problem itself, must be distributed about its multiple levels of social and ecological organization.",

Whether there exists the political will to change is an open question. Denial, jockeying and obfuscation are presently rampant. Chinese officials have expended much effort in denying responsibility for bird flu (Wallace 2007) or, in the epidemiological equivalent of the American practice of paying off the families of collateral damage without admitting guilt, offered small sums to affected countries. In 2007, China donated US$500,000 to Nigeria's effort to fight bird flu. Never mind that Nigeria would never have needed the aid if China had not infected it-albeit indirectly-with bird flu in the first place. The Qinghai-like strain Nigeria now hosts first originated in southern China. Meanwhile, the US and EU, criticizing a stubborn Indonesia unwilling to share H5N1 samples, have blocked Indonesian efforts to reform a system of worldwide vaccine production that rewards pharmaceutical companies and the richest populations at the expense of the poorest (Hammond 2007 (Hammond , 2008 .",

While the argument has been made that corporate food supplies the cheap protein many of the poorest need, the millions of small farmers who fed themselves (and many millions more) would never have needed such a supply if they had not been pushed off their lands in the first place. A reversal need not involve ending global trade or an anachronistic turn to the small family farm, but might include domestically protected farming at multiple scales (Brown and Getz 2008; Levins 1993 Levins , 2007 . Farm ownership, infrastructure, working conditions, and animal health are inextricably linked. Once workers have a stake in both input and output-the latter by outright ownership, profit sharing, or the food itself-production can be structured in such a way that respects human welfare, and, as a consequence, animal health. With locale-specific farming, genetic monocultures of domesticated animals which promote the evolution of virulence can be diversified back into heirloom varieties that can serve as immunological firebreaks. The economic losses influenza imposes upon global livestock can be tempered: fewer interruptions, eradication campaigns, price jolts, emergency vaccinations, and wholesale repopulations (Van Asseldonk et al 2005) . Rather than jury-rigged with each outbreak, the capacity for restricting livestock movement is built naturally into the regional farm model.",

Millions of people have moved into Guangdong over the past decade, a part of one of the greatest migration events in human history, from rural China into cities of the coastal provinces(Fan 2005). Shenzhen, one of Guangdong's Special Economic Zones for open trade, grew from a small city of 337,000 in 1979 to a metropolis of 8.5 million by 2006. As discussed earlier, concomitant changes in agricultural technology and ownership structure have put hundreds of millions more animals into production(Burch 2005;Luo, Ou and Zhou 2003;Sun et al 2007). Poultry output increased in China from 1.6 million tons in 1985 to nearly 13 million tons by 2000.As MikeDavis (2005:63)  summarizes it, by the onset of pathogenic H5N1, only the latest pathogen to emerge under such socioecological conditions, [S]everal subtypes of influenza were traveling on the path toward pandemic potential.
