There have been three pandemics of influenza in the past 100 years and the one upper most in our minds is the 1918 pandemic because of its size and high, total mortality of some 40 million people.9 Patients of all ages died, including young adults aged 20\u201340 years. This was a distinct difference from the usual pattern of mortality of seasonal influenza epidemics in which patients at the extremes of age suffer the greatest mortality. A lack of influenza immunity was an important reason for its easy spread and high mortality which has also been attributed to viral genes that facilitate high viral loads, excessive innate inflammatory response and fatal primary viral pneumonia.10, 11, 12, 13 A recent re-examination of microbiological data and lung tissue from 1918 has suggested strongly that secondary bacterial pneumonia also played a key role in the high mortality.14 In 2009, the world is experiencing a fourth pandemic of a novel influenza A/H1N1 virus. Our knowledge of this infection is increasing and important lessons learnt may impact our thinking regarding H5N1.15, 16\n",

Tell the doctor if you have had contact with sick or dead birds.\n\n",

Clade 1 H5N1 is intrinsically more sensitive than the clade 2 H5N1 to oseltamivir. The experience from seasonal influenza viruses is that sensitive viruses may mutate and develop reduced sensitivity to the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir and the adamantanes, amantadine and rimantadine.74, 75, 76, 77, 78\n",

These should include patient isolation, preferably in a negative pressure room, restriction of visitors, full respiratory and droplet protection for health staff caring for the patient i.e. gloves, goggles, respirators (e.g. N95), and gowns.
