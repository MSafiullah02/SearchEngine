For the past 50 years, in-hospital studies on the circadian rhythm of ACS have been performed, suggesting there are significant circadian rhythms of the incidence of ACS [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. No study to date, however, has examined the presentation of ACS in the prehospital setting. We examined data from the emergency medical services (EMS) system in Beijing, China. Our goal was to examine circadian, day-of-week, and age patterns of occurrence in ACS in an EMS system. Understanding of the rhythm can aid in the preventive strategy as well as the preparation and planning for ACS in EMS systems.",

Emergency medical services system physicians enter clinical data on standardized forms, including the patients' general information, chief complaint, medical history, bedside physical examination, and a preliminary diagnosis. In this study, the electronic prehospital medical records from the Beijing's EMS system spanning August 1, 2005, to July 31, 2007, were reviewed by 2 emergency attending physicians. Acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed by EMS system physicians in the prehospital setting, based on symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and the patient's prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram. Physicians reviewing the charts for purposes of this study did not seek to agree or disagree with the diagnosis so long as all the required data were present on the EMS system run sheets.",

            "text": "The reason for a morning peak has been elucidated in various studies. First, there is a morning increase in plasma catecholamine, and serum cortisol levels can increase the direct sympathetic overactivity in the morning hours, which may also enhance myocardial demand [10], [11]. Second, an increase in sympathetic tone occurring on awaking causes increases in blood pressure, heart rate, coronary tone, and myocardial contractility, which singly or together may result in a substantial augmentation of myocardial oxygen consumption [12], [13]. Finally, the increased tendency of ACS in the morning can be explained by several mechanisms including increase in platelet aggregation and activation of the clotting system due to a decrease in fibrinolytic and anti\u2013thrombin \u0428 activity [14]. A combination of all these factors may possibly explain the cardiac events occurring more frequently in the morning hours. Atherosclerotic plaques may rupture from rapid and large changes of mechanical stresses on awakening in the morning.",

Although not significant, our study shows that the incidence is higher on Friday and not on Monday in Beijing. This may be explained as follows: (1) When Friday comes, people have been exhausted by their work for 5 days. The accumulated work load during a week could be an important factor for ACS. (2) The home gathering of the Chinese people, especially city dwellers, usually occurs on the weekend. The aged people may experience more excitement than on other days in a week. These explanations need to be confirmed in future studies.",
