The disease spread rapidly across all the Chinese provinces within a few days for several reasons. First, the local government did not realize that the disease had human-to-human transmission characteristics. Second, it was the beginning of China's Spring Festival travel rush and local university students were all leaving for the holidays. On January 21st, Beijing finally announced that the virus had human-to-human transmission characteristics, which caused widespread public panic. Local governments across China then issued a first level public health alert and advised most citizens into home-quarantine to reduce the risk of transmission. By March 11, about 80,963 people in China had contracted the virus, of which 4,492 were seriously ill, and 3,162 had died.",

            "text": "Unlike individual level traumatic events, the COVID-19 outbreak has been a continuing crisis for every member of society. It is well known that stressful events such as natural disasters and man-made traumas can have a significant mental health impact and can result in conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (Kopala-Sibley et al., 2016; Plexousakis et al., 2019; Schwartz et al., 2019). However, the impact of acute, pervasive, and continuing stressors on societal and individual psychologies, such as those associated with highly infectious and fatal disease outbreaks (Leppin and Aro, 2009) is poorly understood. Further, little is known about the prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems when faced with such stressors. Studies based on the similar 2003 SARS epidemic outbreak indicated that during the epidemic, different groups of people from the general public to health care workers had varying degrees of psychological problems such as fear and worry (Loh et al., 2005; Mihashi et al., 2009), PTSD and depression (Chen et al., 2006). It was also found that a number of SARS-related stressors predicted psychological symptoms in a sample of college students (Main et al., 2011). To date, there have been no studies on the psychological effects of the new coronavirus on the general population. However, it is expected that the need for psychological intervention will gradually increase and prompt rapid and urgent research on the associated psychological effects (Duan and Zhu, 2020). Therefore, as information available from previous studies is very limited, more research is needed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

It is therefore necessary to understand the possible relationships between the COVID-19 pandemic, sleep duration and underlying mental illnesses in the college student population. Many people chose to self-isolate in their homes when the outbreak was announced. However, based on a study published from the SARS epidemic, the longer the isolation, the higher the possibility of psychological distress (Reynolds et al., 2008). Therefore, it is necessary to explore the relationship between the time spent in home-quarantine and mental illness to understanding the effect of major epidemic disease outbreaks on people's psychology. Such studies would improve knowledge on the psychological adjustment mechanisms needed to ensure the general well-being of the population. Based on previous studies, the following hypotheses are therefore proposed:",

Almost everyone in the sample had been exposed to unceasingly stressful social media information about the new coronavirus. Faced with the lack of communication clarity common in initial disease outbreak periods, these reports tended to be full of rumors and uncertainty, which possibly amplified people's psychological distress (Johal, 2009; Ma, 2008). Many people therefore believed that this unknown new virus was highly contagious (Xu et al., 2020) and had many unknown transmission routes that could cause death or disability. They also believed that if they caught it, they would not receive good treatment and would infect their families. Because they could do little to change the external situation, in addition to fear and worry, many experienced feelings of helplessness (Zheng et al., 2005), which could partly explain the prominent rate of depression in the sample. Another explanation could be that as the social isolation reduced interpersonal communication, people's feelings of loneliness increased, which resulted in depressive symptoms (Ge et al., 2017; Weiss, 1973).",

In that study, longer quarantine durations were found to be associated with increased PTSD symptom prevalence, which was inconsistent with our results. These differences may have been because the Canadian participants had different levels of contact with the diagnosed patients, which may have increased their contamination fears. The depression prevalence in this study was comparable with the 8.8% estimate found in a general population of 959 Chinese college students using the same screening scale (Zhang et al., 2013). The depression rate, however, was slightly lower than the 11.8% found in an earlier study on Chinese college students based on the BDI scale (Yu et al., 2015). Therefore, the depression rate in the college students during the pandemic was not particularly high, possibly because it had only been a month since the start of the pandemic. Because there have been limited similar studies in the past, it is difficult to directly compare the rates in this study. However, as the college students were found to have higher rates of depression than PTSD, it is recommended that university mental health professionals pay greater attention to the incidence of depression in college student groups. As it is early days in the progression of COVID 19, the longitudinal mental health changes are as yet unknown. Therefore, further studies are needed to provide insight into the psychological impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the public.",

However, the objective factor of \u2018living in the worst-hit area\u2019 had a relatively minor contribution. Fear is an adaptive response that initiates defensive behaviors to protect the self from danger, which means that PTSD can occur when fear is inappropriately regulated (Rau et al., 2005). A central PTSD problem has been found to be a reduced capacity to suppress fear even in safe conditions (Norrholm et al., 2011). However, in this study, fear was found to be an important predictor for both PTSD and depression. This was in contrast with previous studies that found that impaired fear inhibition was a biomarker for PTSD but not for depression (Jovanovic et al., 2010). One possible explanation for these results is that in some vulnerable personality types, anger and fear traits may act as moderators or mediators between fear and psychological distress (Lara and Akiskal, 2006). Given the contagious nature of the COVID 2019 and its long incubation period (14 days or more), many people may have feared that they would be unwittingly infected and would spread the disease to their family members. Therefore, psychological interventions that reduce the fear of the pandemic and instill emotional resilience in the people exposed to the pandemic could be helpful in preventing the development of PTSD or depressive symptoms. Further studies after an exposure to epidemics or traumas are needed to clarify the etiology of and relationship between fear and psychological distress.",

However, these results were in line with a previous meta-analysis that found that short sleep durations (< 6 hours) were associated with a higher risk of depression, and longer sleep durations (>9 hours) were not associated with a significant risk of depression (Sun et al., 2018). The strong association between short sleep duration and PTSD in our results, however, was in agreement with previous studies on veterans (Swinkels et al., 2013) and earthquake survivors (Fan et al., 2017). As it was assumed that sleep duration mediated mental health problems, severe exposure may deteriorate sleep duration, which may then give rise to depression or PTSD, which is consistent with previous SARs studies (Johal, 2009). Other sleep parameters or other variables may also have acted as mediators; however, this requires further study. Nonetheless, these results add to previous studies that suggest that strategies to prevent short sleep durations could substantially reduce the risk of psychological problems from pandemic exposure.",

The possible reason could be that as these students are due to complete their degrees this year, the uncertainty about the pandemic effect may have increased their worry about graduating, finding a job or enrolling in further study. This additional stress combined with the effects of the pandemic could be seen to be a dose-effect response that identifies a possible risk for developing mental health problems. Therefore, to ease their concerns, subsequent psychological interventions should focus on strengthening psychological counseling and emotional comfort for graduating students. Further, the government could formulate special measures to assist these students obtain employment and provide compensatory opportunities for further study.",
