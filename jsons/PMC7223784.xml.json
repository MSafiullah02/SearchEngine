Teenagers who smoke cigarettes are more likely to use other substances (i.e., alcohol and marijuana) and be involved in risky behaviors, such as violence, theft, and suicide [4, 5]; this behavior increases the risk of being involved in trauma [6].",

            "text": "There are over 7000 chemicals in tobacco smoke [7]. Acrolein, one of the cigarette\u2019s many carcinogens, has been demonstrated to increase lung vascular permeability by disrupting adherens junctions and actin fibers [8, 9]. Other chemicals in cigarette smoke are known to cause cellular insult, which increases the risk of bacterial pneumonia [10, 11]. Additionally, cigarette smoking causes an increase in reactive oxygen species and decreases surfactant production, both of which are underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12\u201317]. Approximately 200,000 patients in the United States develop ARDS each year, with up to 4.4% occurring in trauma patients [18, 19]. One retrospective cohort study suggested that 50% of ARDS cases were associated with cigarette smoking [20]. Similarly, a prospective study on blunt trauma patients found that cigarette smoking increased platelet aggregation and was associated with an increased risk of ARDS [21]. Additionally, there are studies that link smoking to the development of pneumonia [22, 23], and many studies show a high incidence of pneumonia in trauma patients [24\u201327]. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the rate of pneumonia and ARDS in adolescent trauma smokers. We hypothesized that adolescent smokers with traumatic injury have a higher rate of ARDS and pneumonia compared to non-smokers. In addition, we also sought to provide a descriptive analysis of adolescent smokers involved in trauma.",

Due to the observed imbalance in the sample size between the two groups, smokers were matched with non-smokers using a 1:2 propensity score model based on age, gender, hypotension on admission (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg), injury severity score (ISS), as well as injuries to the brain, spine, upper and lower extremity, lung, heart, stomach, small intestine, colorectal, pancreas, liver, spleen, and kidney. Injuries were defined by appropriate international-classification of diseases version-9 (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. We included in our analysis only those cases that were within 0.001 of the estimated logit. This technique of defining the closeness of a matched case is termed caliper matching and is a validated method of emulating randomization in observational studies [28]. Once propensity scores were calculated for each case, one smoker and two non-smoking-matched patients were identified from the sample. If a patient that smoked did not have a close match available, they were excluded from any further analysis. All p values were two sided, with a statistical significance level of < 0.05. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 24, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).",

Previous studies on adult smokers have demonstrated increased rates of ARDS secondary to lung injury when compared to non-smokers in both critically ill and trauma patients [21, 29\u201332]. In a study of 74 patients by Panzer et al., critically ill adult trauma smokers had an altered respiratory bacterial community including enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae associated with an increased incidence of ARDS [29]. There is a progressive increase in incidence of ARDS following trauma with increasing age, with a peak incidence in patients aged 60\u201369 years [33]. Our results demonstrated a low incidence (0.3%) of ARDS in the adolescent trauma population, with all cases occurring in smokers; however, this was not statistically significant in comparison to the non-smokers. Our findings are consistent with other pediatric studies, which report a low incidence of ARDS in non-trauma patients. Furthermore, the rate of ARDS has previously been shown to be low specifically in pediatric trauma patients with Roulet et al. finding an incidence of 0.5% of all pediatric trauma admissions and Killen et al. demonstrating an incidence of 1.8% of all pediatric patients admitted to an ICU [34, 35]. Lee et al. postulated the lower rate of ARDS and associated mortality in younger patients is due to greater capacity for repair, and altered cytokine burden including interleukin-1 and -8, and tissue necrosis factor alpha [36]. In addition, there is also likely a dose/duration association with smoking that may have not reached a critical threshold for these adolescents [37]. Future investigations regarding the pathophysiology that protects adolescents from developing ARDS appears warranted.",

Bagaitkar et al. demonstrated that adult patients who smoke cigarettes have a 2.6-fold increased risk of developing pneumonia [22]. However, Ferro et al.\u2019s retrospective analysis of adult trauma patients demonstrated no difference in the rate of pneumonia in smokers compared to non-smokers [38]. Our data are the first to suggest an increased incidence of pneumonia in adolescent trauma patients who smoke. One explanation for the difference in results is that unlike the study by Ferro et al., we propensity-matched smokers to similar non-smokers based on comorbidities and injuries. In addition to the morbidity associated with pneumonia, treatment costs $6042 on average for younger patients with the majority of the cost due to the hospital LOS [39, 40]. Our data corroborate this finding as adolescent smoking trauma patients were demonstrated to have a longer LOS. While there is certainly a dose\u2013response increase in respiratory complications caused by cigarette smoking, this study demonstrates an increased rate of pneumonia and hospital LOS despite only minimal cumulative exposure. Our results suggest there is no safe smoking age, and by understanding this risk, clinicians can counsel their adolescent patients on the dangers of both short- and long-term cigarette smoking.",

In fact, several studies have demonstrated a lower mortality in adult smokers following a traumatic injury [38, 42, 43]. This phenomenon is termed the \u201csmoker\u2019s paradox,\u201d and was originally described in adult patients who sustained acute myocardial infarction [44\u201346]. One proposed mechanism is that smoking increases coagulability, which may be beneficial during an acute hemorrhagic injury [47]. Another possible mechanism is that exposure to cigarette smoke causes adaptation to hypoxemia such that periods of acute ischemia associated with hemorrhagic shock from trauma have less of a deleterious effect [48]. There are currently no studies demonstrating the \u201csmoker\u2019s paradox\u201d in the adolescent population regardless of the disease process. Our data demonstrated that smoking had no effect on risk of survival in adolescent trauma patients. In fact, the only two complications that were increased in this population were pneumonia and an unplanned return to the operating room. This may suggest that the protective mechanism of cigarette smoking has not yet developed in adolescent smokers who likely have not smoked for as long as adults who exhibit the smoker\u2019s paradox. Future combined clinical and basic science research to evaluate this is needed.",

A significant limitation is that 538 patients did not fit into our propensity-matched model and thus, were excluded from the analysis. Alternatively, we could have decreased the number of controls we utilized in our propensity matching; however, this may have resulted in a biased matching system. Furthermore, there was no difference in baseline characteristics and outcomes in the total smokers compared to the smokers we utilized after propensity matching. In addition, missing pertinent data variables include the timing of pneumonia and whether it was community acquired or nosocomial, the bacterial pathogen, and means of diagnosis of pneumonia (i.e., clinical vs. culture). Urine markers indicating recent cigarette smoke exposure, as well as pulmonary functional status (i.e., baseline incentive spirometer or pulmonary function testing) are not available within the TQIP database. Also, given that smoking is a self-reported variable, it is highly likely the incidence is significantly underreported, especially in an adolescent population that may be apprehensive to disclose illegal conduct. In addition, limitations of the database include the lack of granularity regarding the smoking history including the number of cigarettes smoked daily as well as how many years of smoking previously occurred. Although the non-smoking group had not smoked within the past 12 months, the percentage of ex-smokers in this group is not available within the database. Finally, there are no data within TQIP regarding other forms of smoking such as vaping. Despite these limitations, we are the first to evaluate adolescent smokers using a large trauma database and our study is strengthened by its generalizability.",

Future research is needed to target this at-risk adolescent trauma population for smoking cessation counseling to help decrease the risk of pneumonia and reduce hospital costs.
