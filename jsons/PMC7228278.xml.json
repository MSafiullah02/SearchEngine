            "text": "Recent pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, has brought closely into our sight the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). This new coronavirus, named 2019\u2010nCoV, belonging to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, distinct from Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2010coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), was described by Zhu et al.\n1\n The first case of an unexplained new pneumonia origin was detected on 12 December 2019 and was later determined by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a non\u2010SARS nCoV. The Coronaviridae family consists of a group of large, single, and plus stranded RNA viruses isolated from multiple species, and it is known to cause the common cold and diarrheal diseases in humans.\n2\n, \n3\n In 2003, the SARS outbreak was associated with a new coronavirus, that is, SARS\u2010CoV.\n2\n, \n3\n However, a number of cases of unknown cause of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, with clinical presentations closely resembling viral pneumonia.\n4\n A total of 1975 cases of pneumonia have been confirmed in China so far (according to the state council information office in Beijing, China's capital, 26 January 2020).\n5\n, \n6\n Yet the virus has tended to spread out of China, since one case in Thailand, one case in Japan, and two cases in Korea had been sequentially reported since 15 January 2020.\n7\n Surprisingly, the transmission of animals to humans is considered the origin of epidemics, as in November, many patients reported to have visited a local fish and wild animal market in Wuhan. Apart from this, recently, evidence has been gathered for the animal to the human and interhuman transmission of the virus.\n6\n, \n8\n The situation is getting serious day by day and for further prevention and control, it is imperative that we have a better understanding of its pandemic nature. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID\u201019 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern, following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016), and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019).\n9\n Meanwhile, on 11 February 2020, the WHO announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019\u2010nCoV: coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019). Until 24 February 2020, 2019\u2010nCoV has affected more than 79 331 patients in 29 countries/regions and has become a major global health concern. On the basis of situational report\u201035 by WHO, China has confirmed 77 262 cases with 2595 deaths reported until 24 February 2020. However, the rest of the world has confirmed 2069 cases (300 new cases) with 23 deaths reported so far. Till now, China reported 415 new confirmed cases, with 150 new deaths. In comparison, there were 300 new confirmed cases reported outside of China with the number of new deaths being 6 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200224-sitrep-35-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac4218d2). With regard to the virus itself, the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy has renamed 2019\u2010nCoV as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n10\n As the outbreak of the novel SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is expanding rapidly in China and beyond, threatening to become a global pandemic, epidemiological data need to be analyzed in a way so that the exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods and visualization model will increase the situational awareness among the mass community in upcoming days. Health workers, governments, and the public, therefore, need to cooperate globally to prevent its spread.",

Here, we present an effort to visualize and analyze data between 22 January 2020 and 16 February 2020. However, a massive number of cases are reported in China compared to the rest of the world, and interestingly, the next few affected countries are the neighbors of China. Moreover, even in China, most of the cases reported are from a particular province Hubei. It is no surprise because Hubei's capital is Wuhan, where the first cases are reported. Till now, COVID\u201019 propagated almost 29 countries worldwide and 31 states or provinces in China. Outside China, as expected, there was not much death due to COVID\u201019 recorded. Only five deaths outside China are reported until 16 February 2020. There are, however, more cases of recovered than death, and in comparison, with 1770 deaths, there were recovery cases of 10 865 patients. We also provide a map representation of different countries with confirmed cases and death reported respectively till 16 February 2020 based on their longitude and latitude. We have enlisted all 29 affected countries outside China and the number of confirmed cases of different Chinese provinces for providing a vibrant depiction of this intense SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Table 3).",

Each map segment represents a region, by using visual data analytics it helps the individuals to understand the epidemiological nature of COVID\u201019. From the map representation, it is apparent that China reported the highest confirmed cases with a high number of 70 446. Likewise, China reported the highest number of death, and it was 1765 (till 16 February 2020). We also examine the time\u2010series data using V\u2010EDA to provide a strong and understandable outcome of this extreme outbreak of COVID\u201019. It is obvious that analyzing these data in real\u2010time is extremely useful in capturing an epidemic behavior of this severe disease. We believe this method of analyzing data will certainly increase the understanding of the situation and inform interventions.

Alternately, we also visualize the tree map for the number of deaths and recovered cases reported between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020. The highest number of deaths reported in Hubei province in China. The greatest number of deaths reported in Hubei was 1696 till 16 February 2020 and the next highest number found in Henan with 13 deaths reported till the mentioned date. However, 6639 successful recovered cases were reported in Hubei and 465 were in Guangdong, and 464 were in Hunan (Table 3). Moreover, a tree map representation for all the countries that have reported confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases globally (except China) also provided in this exploration. Singapore reported the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 immediately after China with a number of 75 and Japan with a confirmed case of 59 is in the next position after Singapore. In terms of deaths reported globally except China, all the five countries (France, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines) reported one death case between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 (Table 3).

And the issues resulting from the advent of a newly identified organism as it spreads through individuals and across national and international frontiers. At the advent of an outbreak, such as this, readily available data and information are equally important to begin the evaluation needed to understand the risks and start containment outbreak activities. Such information includes initial reports of countries with confirmed, death, and recovered cases ratio; also, how the countries outside china are affecting, how the province of China are struggling to handle the situation of COVID\u201019, and more importantly, ratio analysis of these real\u2010world data, as well as information obtained from specific regions of globally from past outbreaks. Information and understanding of the consequences are needed to help us to refine the risk assessment as the outbreak continues and to ensure that patients are best managed. Much of this information emerges in real\u2010time, challenges our understanding, and yet refines our responses. The analysis presented here based on EDA and V\u2010EDA with the help of the dataset provided by John Hopkins University, WHO, CDC, National Health Commission, and DXY. However, we have preprocessed and cleaned the dataset information according to our needs. For storing and analyzing the data, we have used the python\u2010based library of NumPy (https://numpy.org/) and pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org). Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org), Plotly (https://plot.ly), Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org), and Folium were also used to visualize the highlighted data in an interactive manner. All the experiment with the dataset has been made by using the support of Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org) in a Linux based local machine platform by using Python Language in the Machine Learning Research Lab at the Dhaka International University. We report here each and every single detail of different cases of COVID\u201019 between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Currently, there is an obvious urgency to understand the consequences of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viruses not only in China but also worldwide to aware of ourselves for upcoming days. Therefore, this is a minor initiative of analyzing real\u2010world time\u2010series data and visualize them in such a manner so that people around the globe have better understandings of its severe nature. We are still observing the undesirable prevalence of this SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, and to date 24 February 2020, the number of death cases reported was 2618, and among them, only 23 death cases reported outside China. This is extremely alarming not only to China but to the rest of the world as well. In this study, we have enlisted the most reported cases in China, outside China, and in different provinces in China. We also analyzed the number of affected countries with reported confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases. Apart from that, we designed map view and tree map's view with an appropriate number to analyze the epidemiological outbreak of the COVID\u201019.",

Such activities can help us to generate and disseminate detailed information to the scientific community, especially in the early stages of an outbreak, when there is a little else available, allowing for independent assessments of key parameters that influence interventions. We observe an interesting different case reported based on the different datasets of 2019\u2010nCoV, which helps us to understand that it needs more epidemiological and serological studies. We also investigated early indications that the response is being strengthened in China and worldwide on the basis of a decrease in the case of detection time and rapid management of internationally identified travel\u2010related cases. As a caveat, this is an early data analysis and visualization approach of a situation that is rapidly evolving. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt on COVID\u201019, which focuses on the V\u2010EDA based on different data sources. However, knowledge about this novel SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus remains limited among general people around the globe. Raw data released by various sources are not adequately capable to provide an informative understanding of COVID\u201019, caused of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Therefore, A user\u2010friendly data visualization model will be more effective to understand the epidemic outbreak of this severe disease. Visualization model like map view and tree map view provides an interactive interface and visualize each and every raw fact in a comprehensive manner. Hopefully, in the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor this outbreak's epidemiology data that we have used in this study and from other official sources.",
