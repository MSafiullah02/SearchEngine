Here, we discuss ten of these challenges and responses, viz ., 1) rapid construction of a big data information system for the epidemic; 2) rapid problem-oriented big data acquisition and integration; 3) convenient multi-scale dynamic mapping for epidemics; 4) comparison between spatial tracking and the spatiotemporal trajectory of big data; 5) spatiotemporal prediction of the transmission speed and scale of the epidemic; 6) spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level; 7) spatial dynamic balancing of supply and demand for medical resources; 8) assessment of the supply of materials and transportation risk; 9) rapid estimation of the population flow and distribution; and 10) monitoring the spatial spread of social sentiment and detection.",

However, the constructed information system is commonly limited by the basic functions of the commercial software. In response to the epidemic, many institutions and research groups have built a number of information systems, such as \"epidemic map displays\", \"fever clinic queries\" and \"passenger information queries\", based on existing commercial software, which has made an important contribution to epidemic prevention and control ( CAICT: China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, 2020 ). Considering that decision-making in regard to epidemic prevention and control requires rapid analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics and comprehensive consideration of multiple geographical scales, the systems development teams have 1) connected health departments and the internet to build a virtual perception network of multi-source spatiotemporal big data about the epidemic, and developed GIS for the epidemic from a daily time scale, which is a relatively static information system, into real-time dynamic GIS on hourly or even minute-by-minute timescales; 2) built a spatiotemporal cube model of big data about the epidemic, and realized the normalized modeling of multi-source heterogeneous data with different spatial references, different times, different scales and different semantics, as well as creating a unified storage system and management of mixed polymorphic data; 3) set up a computing engine for epidemic description, diagnosis, prediction and decision-making, and developed the traditional online GIS for epidemics with the \"visualizing query\" function to an integrated stage with \"visualization query analysis\"; 4) developed a multi-scale integrated spatiotemporal dynamic visualization technology to visualize the epidemic at the \"country, province, city, county, community, and individual \" scales in order to manage visualization analysis on \"one map \" of multidimensional epidemic data under a unified spatiotemporal da-tum; 5) adopted the new generation of native cloud architecture technology to develop a three-tier structure consisting of the infrastructure as the background, a platform for spatiotemporal big data management as the middle ground, and application for the epidemic as the foreground, which solved problems caused by traditional information systems, such as overfull links in development mode, complex processing and long lead time, and satisfied the demand for rapid construction of GIS for an epidemic in an emergency.

Strategies for gathering and integrating massive geographic and social-spatial information in the face of prevention and control of an epidemic emergency is the most basic problem for subsequent temporal and spatial mining and analysis. Based on the unified geographical framework, this research quickly absorbed and integrated geographical big data, including the WHO data released internationally, daily domestic health and disease control data, professional population health platform data, Tencent location request data, Baidu migration data, microblog text data, patient spatiotemporal trajectory data, international airline data, census data, education enrollment data, land cover data, remote sensing imagery and other multi-source data through statistical data collection, network data mining, API interface connection, and international and domestic data platform exchange. With the support of unified spatial registration, raster-vector transformation, statistical normalization, format transformation, etc., these data were rapidly merged and applied to the spatiotemporal analysis and visualization systems for the COVID-19 epidemic. In this process, due to the weakness of current research on the classification and security management of spatiotemporal big data, it is clear that GIS needs to be developed in the aspects of automatic correlation aggregation of data, historical data tracing, adaptive conversion of heterogeneous data, and standardized storage of multi-source data.",

Several color schemes were designed to not only reflect thematic knowledge with the use of color but also to provide more emotively intuitive information, such as a red-purple color scheme for the COVID-19 cases, a blue-black color scheme for the cases with mortality, and a yellow-green color scheme for cured cases. Daily animation maps were applied to express the spatiotemporal characteristics of the spread of the epidemic. The knowledge mapping method combined with the epidemiological and emergency response-related profes-sional knowledge were also utilized further.

A spatiotemporal diffusion model (Multi susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed-died-cumulative model, multi-SEIRDC model) centered on Wuhan was established, which takes into account factors including the effects of spatial barriers from human intervention, the impact of large-scale population migration during the Chinese New Year and the spatial heterogeneity of different epidemic areas. The multi-SEIRDC model was used to track, derive and predict the COVID-19 epidemic situation in different regions of China. Research has shown that the earliest time when COVID-19 began to spread from person to person was in late November or early December. The expected basic reproduction number was 4.08, with a range of 3.37-4.77. The day before the Wuhan lockdown, there were approximately 20,000 people infected with COVID-19 nationwide. As of March 5, the number of potentially infected people in Wuhan exceeds 100,000. Due to the serious lack of detection capacity, there may have been a large number of neglected mild and asymptomatic infections before February 13, 2020. The effective reproduction number outside Hubei fell below the threshold of 1 on February 2, and reached an inflection point and entered a steady decline. The number of new cases per day will fluctu-ate under 10 cases for approximately one month before the end of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The research indicated that until 24:00 on February 2, 2020, the severity of the epidemic in each province was highly correlated with the population who travelled there from Wuhan before the city of Wuhan was locked down, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77. A risk assessment model was constructed with the spatial distribution of the number of confirmed cases and the population migration, and three risk level areas were outlined on the regional scale and on the urban scale for the cities with high risks of epidemics, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wenzhou, Zhuhai, Changsha and Harbin. However, after the Spring Festival, the epidemic risk had a high probability of increasing due to the return flow. The three variables, viz., case number, population migration, and transportation network, were incorporated into the prediction. The results (not including those for Hubei) suggested that, after the Spring Festival Holiday, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Shanghai would have the highest levels of risk, followed by Chongqing, Changsha, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Xi'an, and Chengdu.

In this case, the key to epidemic prevention and control is knowing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the supply and demand for medical resources to optimize the allocation of materials. Based on the factors of online hospital help information, local cases and forecasts, and existing resource data, we analyzed the current dynamic situation of medical protective equipment across the country through cross-validation and sampling verification (phone inquiry and web inquiry) and attained the following: 1) the prompt identification of a shortage of medical protective equipments in 462 hospitals, including 336 in Hubei Province and the rest in Sichuan Province, Anhui Province, Guangdong Province, Jiangsu Province and Hunan Province, among others; and 2) based on the number of confirmed cases, the number of hospitals that lacked sufficient medical protective equipments and the urban population, the shortage of medical supplies was divided into four levels on a regional scale and three levels on a city scale (the result for Hubei Province is shown in Fig. 7 , and the national result is shown in Fig. 8 ) . The above achievements provided an important scientific basis for the national al- location of medical care resources for the prevention and control of the epidemic.",

We have integrated multiple datasets, such as provincial epidemic data, online consumption data and postal service data, to analyze the supply-demand situation and price changes in necessities and food, including vegetables and meat, for every province during the epidemic prevention period, as well as the changing volume and trends of postal and express delivery businesses in each region, to identify the area, type, and the transportation support capacity of the material shortage risks. Through this, we provided scientific data for the social management departments to obtain the material supply-demand dynamic information in real time. Meanwhile, by tracking the transportation of materials, we identified the highly sensitive nodes that may invoke virus transmission during the transportation process and provided advance warning and decision support for the prevention and control of the regional spread of the epidemic (the national distribution of risk index is shown in Fig. 9 ). Due to the involvement of company business information in the data, there were many difficulties in the acquisition process, which revealed that knowledge of how businesses constrain data sharing will become an important research direction. At present, JD.COM, SF Express, and other large domestic online shopping and logistics companies have begun to establish GIS-based logistics monitoring systems. In the future, with the support of Internet of Things technology, a national classified material transportation monitoring system and national data integration and analysis platform will be gradually established, which will provide more accurate and timely information on the material supply and transportation capacity during emergency policy-making for the whole society.",

Research has shown a strong relationship between the number of train journeys and the number of COVID-19 cases ( Zhao et al., 2020 ) . Before the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, more than five million people had left Wuhan to other regions in China ( News China, 2020 ). A better understanding of the destinations of those people can assist in decision-making and prevention of coronavirus spread. Therefore, in this research, by using multi-source spatiotemporal big data, including Tencent location request data, Baidu migration data, and land cover data, we have developed a dynamic estimation model of the multilevel spatial distribution of the interregional migrant population and further characterized the spatial distribution of the population migrating from Wuhan to other regions of Hubei Province. The results show that 1) during the Spring Festival, the average ratio between the increases in rural populations to the total population was 124.7% in the prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province, and at least 51.3% of the population moving from Wuhan to prefecture-level cities flowed into rural areas, and 2) the spatial distribution of migrants among cities and counties in Hubei Province exhibited a three-ringed structure. The first ring was the core area of disease, which included Wuhan and its surrounding areas, which mainly experienced population outflows. The second ring was the primary focus area, including Huanggang, Huangshi, Xiantao, Tianmen, Qianjiang, Suizhou, Xiangyang, and parts of Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Jingmen, and Xianning, where the total population and the population in rural areas increased significantly during the Spring Festival. The third ring was the secondary focus area, which included Yichang, Enshi, Shennongjia, and parts of Jingzhou and Jingmen, which were located in the western part of Hubei Province and were mainly characterized by a small population inflow (shown in Fig. 10 ) . The above results were shared with government officials, and the development of the epidemic confirmed the objectivity of this research, which strongly supported government decision-making.",

However, Fig. 11 shows that population mobility has increased since February 17 (the 24 th of the first lunar month of 2020). The return of people to work will possibly increase the spread of COVID-19. Baidu migration data were utilized here to predict the risk ( Xu et al., 2017 ) . We calculated the speed of the population mobility recovery in each city (shown in Fig. 12 a.) based on the population migration from February 17-23, 2020. The result showed that the speed of the return to normal levels of population mobility was rapid in economically developed cities in South China. The community division of the population mobility network showed that the population flows were mostly from the cities in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu to the Yangtze River Delta and from cities in Hunan, Guizhou, and Jiangxi to the Pearl River Delta. Both the departure cities and the destination cities are places with large outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the above analysis, taking strict measures on these moving populations was suggested in the case of the second surge of COVID-19 cases. ",

Therefore, this research applied massive social media data to track and evaluate the spatial spread of public sentiment ( Miller and Goodchild, 2015 ) . Considering that public behavior has the characteristics of irra-tionality, strong infectivity and conformity, we needed to build a knowledge base of epidemic sentiment association by mining the dynamic evolution process of public opinion in time and space and using the semantics from social media ( Goodchild and Glennon, 2010 ; Shi et al., 2017 ) . The Sina Weibo, which is similar to Twitter, is the social media platform on which Chinese people typically share their opinions. With the goal of modelling and visualizing the semantic and spatiotemporal evo-lution of public opinion on COVID-19, a topic extraction and classification framework for extracting topics of a COVID-19-related microblogs was designed and implemented. Based on the complex network, a user semantic behavior evolution model was introduced to measure and analyze the change in public opinion by tracking topics and sentiments that appeared in microblog users' timelines in response to COVID-19. The results indicated that from January 9 to February 10, 2020, more than 60% of posts related to science popularization of disease prevention, government announcements, and responses suggested that public sentiment was positive and stable. The posts with the topics of \"help-seeking \" were concentrated in the key epidemic area of Wuhan, and the posts related to \"donation information \" were widely distributed throughout the country (shown in Fig. 13 ). The results reflected the characteristics of China's emergency disaster relief, which was characterized by the adage \"Trouble on one side, help from all sides\".",
