In this chapter, we discuss whether, and how, these surveys can improve our understanding of the mechanisms of emergence and influence our ability to predict, detect or control emerging diseases. To address the question of which pathogens emerge, we first review what can be learnt from the history of emerging diseases. We then consider surveys that characterise emerging pathogens in terms of taxonomy, host range and transmission routes, drawing on examples from both emerging human and emerging animal diseases to illustrate general patterns in disease emergence. Finally, we present an alternative framework for analysing why different pathogens emerge, attempting to identify high-risk situations and environments that might be of practical relevance for targeting disease surveillance and control measures.",

If the average number of new hosts infected per case (which in the event that the rest of the population is entirely susceptible is the basic reproduction number, R 0 ,) falls below 1, then the pathogen will ultimately die out (Anderson and May 1991) . Pathogen persistence requires a supply of susceptible hosts, generated through birth, immigration or loss of immunity. If a pathogen with an R 0 < 1 is introduced into a na\u00efve population, there may be a small trickle of cases, but the introduction will ultimately fail. If R 0 > 1, then there remains a probability that simply by chance the outbreak may only number a handful of cases, but the probability of a major outbreak is much larger. As the epidemic spreads through the host population, the pool of remaining susceptibles will diminish (as more of the population becomes immune or infected individuals die) and the rate of spread will slow. If the population is smaller than an identifiable critical community size (Bartlett 1966; Keeling and Grenfell 1997) , the pathogen is unlikely to persist and the outbreak will fade-out. This is particularly true for infections with short infectious periods and those that either cause high mortality or generate prolonged host immunity.",

The first key transition in human societies is likely to have been the domestication of livestock 10,000-15,000 years ago, which provided multiple opportunities for disease emergence, first by facilitating cross-species (zoonotic) transmission and, second by allowing the expansion of human settlements large enough for virulent pathogens, such as measles and smallpox, to persist (Diamond 2002) . As settlements became cities, a second transition point was reached: the problems of sanitation and pest control increased, allowing huge epidemics of infections, such as the black death and cholera. Migration, trade, exploration and conquest gave rise to the third major transition during which human infections established in one area were brought to highly susceptible populations in another, often with catastrophic consequences. The Age of Discovery, starting in the fifteenth century, with an estimated 10-15 million deaths in 1520-1521, and other Amerindian and Pacific civilisations were destroyed by imported smallpox and measles. In return, treponemal infections were introduced into Europe.",

Anthropogenic factors have always been the driving force behind human epidemiological change and this situation still applies today. What makes the recent emerging and re-emerging disease trends different to those over the rest of human history is the number of diseases which are increasing and the potential scale of outbreaks (McNeill 1976 , Barrett et al. 1998 . New diseases are currently being detected at a rate of about one new disease per year, with more than 30 new pathogens identified over the past 30 years (CDC http://www.cdc.gov; WHO http://www.who.int; Woolhouse 2002) . Given that a total of only 1,415 human pathogens have been identified , it is possible that the current rate at which humans are acquiring new infections is unprecedented, although data from other major transitions are not available for comparison. Although some new pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Legionella pneumophila have turned out to be newly recognised causes of old diseases, the global impact of entirely new human diseases (such as HIV/AIDS and SARS), and the increasing incidence and spread of pre-existing infectious diseases (such as tuberculosis) cannot be denied.",

Some pathogens have their origins as zoonoses but appear to have evolved as predominantly or exclusively human infections, having adapted to human-to-human transmission after jumping from animals to humans ( R 0 in humans >1). Others require continued re-introduction from animal reservoirs (obligate zoonoses) and have never taken off in the human population as selfsustaining epidemics ( R 0 in humans < 1). Hart et al. (1999) proposed a system of classifying zoonoses based on these distinct mechanisms and the time-scale of emergence events. In the former category, human-specific infections that have their origins in an animal host were defined as either old or recent. Many of these old diseases are thought to have originated from domestic animal pathogens at the time of animal domestication (Bennet and Begon 1997; Diamond 2002) . It is suggested, for example, that measles originated from closely-related morbilliviruses of cattle (rinderpest), and smallpox from poxviruses of either camels or cattle. Examples of recent zoonoses include HIV-1 and HIV-2, which have appeared as new human diseases after jumping the species barrier from primates to humans (Gao et al. 1999; Hahn et al. 2000) and SARS, which is thought have had its origins as a zoonosis (Song et al. 2005) but has now adapted to human-to-human transmission.",

However, most of these accounts have been largely descriptive (e.g. Morse 1995; Osburn 1996 , Murphy 1998 Palmer et al. 1998; Chomel 1998; Daszak et al. 2000) and quantifying risk factors has only been possible with the construction of a database that contains all known human pathogens and thus allows the characteristics of emerging and nonemerging human pathogens to be compared . A similar database has been constructed for domestic carnivore and livestock pathogens allowing features of both human and animal emerging pathogens to be identified . The most important finding of these quantitative analyses is that emerging pathogens are not a random selection of all pathogens, but that host range and pathogen taxonomy are important risk factors for disease emergence.",

Of the 1,415 pathogens identified in the human pathogen database, 61% pathogens from 313 different genera are known to be zoonotic and therefore infect multiple hosts . Overall, 175 (12.4%) human pathogens from 96 genera were identified as the cause of emerging diseases and, of these, 133 (76%) were zoonotic . In this study, zoonoses did not include those which are known to have their origin in animal hosts, but for which infection now occurs exclusively through human-to-human transmission (e.g. HIV-1 and HIV-2). Multi-host pathogens also predominate among animal EIDs, with 90% of emerging livestock diseases and 100% of emerging domestic carnivore diseases caused by multi-host pathogens .",

This applies also to emerging pathogens of domestic animals . Conversely, parasitic helminths are underrepresented in the emerging disease category (RR < 0.25). Although quantitative baseline data are lacking for wildlife diseases (and hence RR cannot be calculated), viral pathogens have also been the cause of most recent wildlife disease outbreaks (Murray et al. 1999; Dobson and Foufopoulos 2001; Funk et al. 2001 ). Among the viruses, RNA viruses have only a slightly higher RR of emergence (RR = 2.8) than DNA viruses (RR = 2.5), but are disproportionately represented among those pathogens that have emerged as new human and animal diseases after jumping from other host species (Table 2 ) .

Several factors has been proposed to explain this observation, such as the relative difficulty of treating viral diseases, improved detection rates, short generation and higher mutation rates (Domingo and Holland 1994) . That RNA viruses are over-represented in instances of pathogens jumping into new host species is consistent with the view that mutation rates may play a role in emergence. High mutation rates in RNA viruses (Drake 1993; Domingo and Holland 1994) , and the existence of multiple variants within strains of RNA viruses, provide an enormous capacity for RNA viruses to adapt to changing host environments and to overcome barriers to spread of virus both within hosts and between species. For example, it has been suggested that the spread of rabies virus within different host tissues and between host species may only be possible as a result of the combined action of virus variants with diverse tissue tropism, with multiple strain variants compensating for the simplicity and lack of regulatory elements within the rabies virus genome (Morimoto et al. 1998 ).",

Many taxonomic groups of pathogen fit comfortably into the paradigm of adaptive radiation, but it is not clear whether the phenomenon of emergence corresponds to a process of increasing ecological generalism or simply host-switching followed by subsequent further specialism (for example, HIV). Host-switching events are indicated throughout the evolutionary record by the frequent topological discordancies in paired hostpathogen phylogenies (Jackson and Charleston 2004) , and it is reasonable to suppose that these switches corresponded to periods of pathogen emergence. But following a host switch, the outcome of opposing selective forces for further adaptation to the new host, or maintaining a broader spectrum of host species use remains unclear.",

First, these surveys all demonstrate the importance of zoonotic transmission in past and current emerging human diseases, emphasising the need to understand the infection dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in both animal and human populations and to broaden the single-species focus of human medicine to incorporate knowledge available within veterinary and wildlife disciplines. It was notable that during the construction of the human infectious disease database, a substantial number of human pathogens were identified as zoonoses from veterinary reference texts, but not from medical texts. Many emerging zoonotic diseases of the future may be infections that are currently recognised by veterinarians or wildlife biologists, and their involvement is likely to be an important element in the early detection of emerging zoonoses. For example, veterinary pathologists at the Bronx zoo played a major role in the detection and identification of West Nile Virus (McNamara 2002). A granulocytic Ehrlichia described from meadow voles on Martha's Vineyard in the 1930s (Tyzzer 1938 ) is now believed to be the agent causing human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Telford 2002) , and archived veterinary material is likely to provide an important source of data for identifying potential reservoirs of new or emerging zoonotic infections.",

The enduring uncertainties about the role of badgers as reservoirs and/or sources of bovine tuberculosis for cattle in the UK typify these difficulties (Krebs et al. 1998 ). For zoonotic diseases, integration and collaboration between disciplines is clearly important.

In the next section, we therefore explore the question of why certain pathogens emerge, attempting to identify circumstances and situations where disease emergence might be expected, so that surveillance and control measures can be targeted to high-risk settings.

Recognition of the importance of human-related impacts has dispelled some of the early complacency about infectious diseases and suggests that the EIDs are likely to increase as the human ecological footprint continues to grow. In theory, it also suggests that counter measures to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic change might be possible. However, risk factors are often cited only in terms of broad categories, such as climate change, human population increase, urbanisation or habitat destruction.

Land-use change could result in pathogen emergence by any of the following factors, which may affect reservoir dynamics or host-reservoir contact patterns: (1) demographic host release arising from reduction of competitor and/or predator species, resulting in competitive release and an increased density of the most competent host for a pathogen (Rosenblatt et al. 1999) , (2) the fence effect, whereby habitat fragmentation restricts dispersal and leads to unnaturally high densities and hence infection rates (Dobson and May 1986) , (3) reduction of species diversity leading to a relative increase in alternative, more competent hosts (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000) , (4) a reduction in the genetic diversity, which may increase opportunities for EIDs (Acevedo-Whitehouse et al. 2003; Keller et al. 2002) with knock-on effects on the equitability of higher trophic levels, (5) enrichment of nutrient status (by pollution or agricultural crop presence, or fertiliser), which may favour certain species that specialise on such resources, (6) elimination of biodiversity creating vacant niches for invasive species, which has been suggested as a factor in the emergence of non-polio enteroviruses following elimination of polio (Delpeyroux et al. 2000) and (7) the establishment of secondary contact zones, in which pathogens introduced into novel environments have the opportunity to come into contact with closely related but previously geographically isolated pathogens. This concept has been explored mainly in the context of plant EIDs and identified as the cause of emergence of diseases, such as Dutch elm disease (Ophiostome novo-ulmi) (Brasier 2001) and novel fungal diseases of alder trees (Alnus spp.) (Brasier et al. 1999) . However, pathogen recombination in secondary animal contact zones may prove to be a rich source of novel zoonotic pathogens (e.g. Waterfield et al. 2004 ).",

The risk of transmission at each of these steps is a function of the number of infections in the source population ( I ), the per capita rate of contact between populations ( C ), the number of individuals engaging in this type of contact behaviour ( N ) and the susceptibility of the host population ( S ) (Fig. 2 ) . The number of cases in the source population, I , reflects both the number of hosts and the incidence/prevalence of infection in the population, and may therefore incorporate enormous complexity (as illustrated by the multiple factors outlined in Box 1 that can affect reservoir infection dynamics). Transmission between host populations is encapsulated by the terms describing both contact and host susceptibility. This framework does not specifically consider the genetic mechanisms by which pathogens acquire or increase their ability to infect humans, but assumes that a pathogen is competent to infect humans.",

For obligate zoonoses, such as rabies, brucellosis, and West Nile virus, there is no human spreader population and all victims are essentially samplers. Mechanisms and risk factors for disease emergence in this group are therefore concerned only with the transmission step between animal host and human samplers (Fig. 2b) .

Obviously in an emerging disease context, there is a knock-on effect between our epidemiological parameters. For example, if contact between a reservoir and sampler population increases, so too does the infection level in the sampler population. We attempted to identify the root effect of the factor in question as the earliest point in the transmission pathway at which the factor operates. For example, we could consider that poor hospital hygiene, which increases transmission of Ebola virus through contact with infected bodily fluids, might influence contact between spreaders and samplers as well as increase infection rates in spreaders.

Using our selected examples, several issues come to light. For all the diseases selected here, emergence has been associated with multiple risk factors, which need to be operating simultaneously or sequentially for a disease to emerge or re-emerge. None of the major categories of risk factor, as they are generally summarised in the literature, operate at a single specific step in the epidemiological framework but have the potential for multiple impacts on infection dynamics. Thus, changes in farming practices can affect zoonotic disease emergence through changing infection rates in animal reservoirs, and/or by increasing contact between reservoirs and samplers.",

More than 1.4 million people cross international borders on flights everyday and cruise ships now have the capacity to carry 47 million passengers per year (Wilson 2003) . Although long-distance movements tend to be associated with transmission by spreaders to the general population, some types of long-distance travel, such as tourism, provide travellers with the potential to act as both samplers and spreaders, and some long-distance trade movements have been associated with increased contact between animal reservoirs (e.g. rats) and humans. Wildlife and livestock movements clearly also play an important role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, with the potential both to increase the incidence of disease in reservoir or source populations and increase reservoir-to-human contact. While limiting human contacts is often difficult, particularly with ease of travel, restricting the scale of legal and illegal movements of domestic animals (livestock and pet animals) and wildlife presents a real opportunity to minimise emergence risks.",

In practice, SARS cases were contained more effectively by simple hygienic precautions, such as wearing masks, than airport surveillance and detection strategies (e.g. thermal imagery) (Bell 2004; John et al. 2005) .

Is it better to try to detect transmission events from animal reservoirs to samplers, which may occur relatively rarely but may allow large and costly outbreaks to be prevented, or to focus surveillance on transmission events in spreader populations, which may occur more frequently, but may result in delayed control of epidemics. How important is it to understand infection dynamics in animal reservoirs, which may be costly and demanding to achieve, particularly for wildlife populations (Haydon et al. 2000) ? For prevention of Nipah virus, for example, is it better to focus efforts on surveillance of fruit-bat reservoir populations, on enhancing the capacity for disease detection in high-risk pig farms (e.g. in areas with recent conversion from mangrove to oil palm plantations), on improving case surveillance in hospitals in these areas, or some combination of these three?",

At this stage in the emergence of zoonoses, it may indeed be possible to identify sentinel (i.e. sampler) populations associated with high-risk situations (Table 4 ). For example, increased bushmeat consumption is cited as a risk factor for the emergence of several zoonoses and novel pathogens, and could be caused by an increase in the number of hunters/consumers (increased N Sa ) and/or increased contact between hunters/consumers and wildlife reservoirs (increased C R-Sa ). Improved surveillance of a sampler population of bushmeat hunters or butchers may detect host-switching and emergence events, possibly before dissemination to the general population. Similarly, farmers and market traders may be suitable sentinels for diseases affected by changes in farming practice, and may allow early detection of new outbreaks of SARS or Nipah virus. The potential value of high-risk human sentinels has been demonstrated, with detection of simian foamy viruses (retroviruses) in villagers in Cameroon that have direct contact with blood and body fluids of non-human primates (Wolfe et al. 2004 ). However, hostswitching events appear to be occurring frequently and, since most outbreaks are small and may never take off , the appropriate response to detecting new microbial agents in human populations remains very uncertain. An alternative approach would be the improvement of medical diagnostics and communication in remote communities (such as at the tropical forest interface), which might provide a more cost-effective approach to preventing large outbreaks of emerging pathogens (Shears 2000a (Shears , 2000b . Land-use changes that affect reservoir infection rates are often associated with emerging zoonoses transmitted from wildlife reservoirs (e.g. Borrelia burgdorferi , Hantaviruses, Nipah viruses). While the emergence of a specific pathogen may be hard to predict, it is certainly predictable that changes in land use carry a risk of zoonotic disease emergence. Can we identify high-risk environments in which accelerating land-use changes raise particular concerns?",

Some pathogens, such as viruses and generalists, may be better at doing this than others, but many different pathogens have emerged. While there are several features that characterise many emerging pathogens and these may be combined into a profile of an emerging disease, most emerging pathogens will not fit this profile exactly. The objective perhaps should not be to predict which pathogens emerge but to plan for the inevitability of emergence events and prepare to detect and deal with them quickly. However, planning an effective response requires an understanding of their epidemiology, and once an emergence event is detected, efforts must be directed to the rapid acquisition of this information. The response to SARS provides encouragement that a flexible, integrated global strategy can be developed. SARS also highlights our inability to predict where and when the next outbreak might occur. Increasing our knowledge about the identity or infection dynamics of animal reservoirs must be a key priority that requires contributions from many different disciplines.",
