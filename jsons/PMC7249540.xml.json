The primary aim of this survey was to obtain a clear description of measures applied in medical oncology departments to prevent COVID-19 infection, as well as timing of preventive measures application and the number of people affected by COVID-19 among healthcare staff and patients. As a study population, we directed the survey to the Chiefs of all the medical oncology departments in the region (n = 12), which was completed on behalf of their departments and staff. The survey was distributed by e-mail one-time and all the Chiefs responded by e-mail within three working days to the initial query. We administered questionnaires to 12 oncological centers of the Emilia Romagna region.",

We found only some divergences about the use of masks with higher grade of protection, the temporal interval and the execution of diagnostic swabs or serological test in patients without specific symptoms. The similarities may reflect the fast publication of joint statements from Italian Oncology Associations (AIOM -COMU - CIPOMO) [11] which provided clear instruction about the optimal management of oncological patients during COVID-19 emergency. In addition, the Federation of Italian Cooperative Oncology Groups, which brings together the 17 Italian cancer cooperative groups that have developed cancer research in Italy, in collaboration with the Italian Data Manager Group, in accordance with the communications of the Italian Medicines Agency [12], the guidelines of the EMA [13] and the recommendations of the Italian Ministry of Health [14], developed indications on the management of interventional clinical studies with drugs during the current emergency for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, in order to make the behavior of the clinical trial centers homogeneous, appropriate and safe [15]). Other possible explanations of some observed differences in the time of adoption of protective measures can be related to differences in the time and grade of infection spread throughout the region (ranging from 1.6 to 10.6 prevalent cases x 1000 inhabitants in the whole population), with some counties more rapidly involved than other, and to the related time of minimization procedures adopted at a general population level, based on government indications.",
