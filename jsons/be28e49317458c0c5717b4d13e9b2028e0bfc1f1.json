Indeed, high frequency of infection has been observed in patients with rheumatic diseases. Despite immunosuppressive agents and impaired immune function had been associated with increased risk of infection [1, 2] , it must be remembered that uncontrolled disease activity is among the most sensitive and specific independent predictors.",
