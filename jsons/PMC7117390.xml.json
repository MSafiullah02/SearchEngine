            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses found in a wide range of animals, including mammals and birds. CoVs exhibit marked tropism for epithelial cells in the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts, and are responsible for a diverse spectrum of enteric, hepatic, neurological, and respiratory illnesses of differing severities. CoVs, classified in the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, are now recognized as emerging viruses with a propensity to cross into new host species (Leopardi et al., 2018). CoVs are subdivided into four genera on the basis of genotypic and serological characterization: alpha and beta coronaviruses, which are found mainly in mammals; gamma coronaviruses, detected in birds and marine mammals; and delta coronaviruses found mainly in birds and swine (de Groot, 2012). The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the CoV genome encodes proteins involved in viral RNA synthesis. Most of these proteins are characteristically encoded by the partially-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, and are translated as the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are then processed by virus-encoded proteinases into 15 or 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) (Ziebuhr, 2005). The remaining 3\u2032 one-third of the genome encodes virus structural proteins, including the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The CoV S protein can be divided into an amino-proximal half (S1 subunit or domain) containing the receptor-binding domain, and a carboxyl-proximal half (S2 subunit or domain) containing elements involved in membrane fusion (Lewis et al., 2015). The S protein is an important target for T cell responses and is the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies, which are elicited by epitopes located mostly in the molecule\u2019s S1 domain (Reguera et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2011). The S1 and S2 domains in some CoVs, e.g. avian CoVs (AvCoVs), are cleaved by a cellular furin-like enzyme (de Haan et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Most viruses in the genus Gammacoronavirus are isolated from birds, including Galliformes (chicken, turkey, quail, guinea fowl, pheasant, and peafowl) (Brown et al., 2016; Cavanagh et al., 2002; Guy, 2008; Liu et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2007; Torres et al., 2017), Anseriformes (duck, goose, teal, swan, and pintail) (Liu et al., 2005; Papineau et al., 2019), Columbiformes (pigeon) (Jonassen et al., 2005), Pelecaniformes (spoonbill and heron), Suliformes (cormorant), Charadriiformes (red knot, oystercatcher, and black-headed gull), and Passeriformes (bulbul) (Chu et al., 2011), although they have also been identified in the beluga whale (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008) and in bottlenose dolphins (Woo et al., 2014). Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) are among the most economically important avian coronaviruses (AvCoVs). IBV was the first recognized CoV in the United States in 1931 (Schalk and Hawn, 1931). IBV is traditionally considered to be a host-specific pathogen in chickens, responsible for respiratory, renal, and genital diseases, with heavy economic consequences worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007). In contrast to alpha and beta coronaviruses, which only occur as one or two different serotypes, IBV has many different serotypes, genotypes, lineages, and variants (Valastro et al., 2016). Furthermore, new IBV genotypes/lineages and variants are continuing to emerge due to its high rate of evolution. This is expressed as an accelerated rate at which viable point mutations, nucleotide insertions, or deletions accumulate in the genome, especially in the S1 gene, associated with a lack of proofreading viral polymerase in IBVs (Cavanagh, 2007), as well as the high rate of virus replication. In addition, evidence suggests that some IBV strains may have arisen by genetic recombination (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Kusters et al., 1989, 1990), or by a combination of mutation and recombination (Jia et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017). TCoV, initially found in the 1970s, is associated with the enteric disease known as transmissible enteritis, coronaviral enteritis of turkeys, or bluecomb (Guy, 2008). TCoV infection was also recently found to be associated with a syndrome comprising several intestinal disorders, usually occurring in turkeys within the first 3 weeks of life and referred to as poult enteritis complex (Barnes et al., 2000). TCoV emergence was proposed to be the result of recombination events involving IBVs and an unidenti\ufb01ed CoV, which donated an S gene encoding a protein of low amino acid identity to those of IBVs (Hughes, 2011; Jackwood et al., 2010). These recombinations resulted in a host shift from chickens to turkeys, and in a change in tissue tropism of the virus from the upper respiratory tract to the intestine.",

Affected birds exhibited reduced egg production among breeding hens, accompanied by loss of shell pigmentation and some abnormal shell quality, with later outbreaks of respiratory signs among affected pheasants. However, there was no evidence of kidney damage in the affected birds. Antibodies against IBV were detected by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test in 80% of tested pheasants and a CoV was isolated that proved to be identical to the agent responsible for infectious bronchitis (IB) in chickens. Two later outbreaks of nephritis occurred in the UK in 1983 and 1984, resulting in the deaths of 450 out of 1000 8-week-old pheasants and 15 out of 160 adult pheasants, respectively, from which CoVs were isolated using 8\u20139-day-old embryonating eggs (Lister et al., 1985). However, intranasal instillation of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with the virus failed to produce any clinical signs of disease. A similar outbreak of nephritis in 1994 resulting in the deaths of over 1000 breeding pheasants out of a total stock of approximately 7000 birds in the UK was considered to be linked to avian IBV (Gough et al., 1996). Sneezing and reduced egg production and hatchability were also reported, but the egg quality was unaffected. Pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV)-associated nephritis and respiratory disease were also subsequently reported in the UK (Pennycott, 2000; Cavanagh et al., 2002). Partial genomic sequence analysis showed that the gene sequences of the pheasant viruses differed from those of IBV to a similar extent as the sequence of one serotype of IBV differs from another (Cavanagh et al., 2002). The above results showed that the CoVs involved in these pheasant infections were closely related to avian IBV; however, the clinical signs and mortality associated with CoV infections in pheasants and the isolated viruses differed from each other and from IBVs. Further studies using molecular techniques are therefore required to determine the complete genomic sequences of CoVs from different outbreaks in pheasants, to compare and fully elucidate their origins and antigenic relationships with strains of IBV.",

LDL/091022 and LJL/140734 were selected because they were genetically related to isolates I0623/17 and I0710/17 based on the phylogenetic trees using both S1 gene/fragment and complete genome sequences. The H120 vaccine was used because it was commonly employed in chicken flocks in China, and was also used for vaccination of some commercial pheasant flocks in China; the H120 vaccine was not used in the affected pheasant flocks in this study. Relatedness values according to the Archetti and Horsfall method (1950) range from 0 for viruses that are antigenically unrelated to 100% for isolates that are identical. This method for assessing the antigenic relatedness of IBV means that viruses of the same serotype may have relatedness values ranging from 50%\u2013100%, whereas viruses of a different serotype typically have relatedness values ranging from 0%\u201320% (Archetti and Horsfall, 1950).",

The diseased birds showed early respiratory signs, suggesting that they may have been caused by respiratory pathogens, possibly including NDV, AIV subtypes H5 and H9, IBV, or PhCoVs. The embryopathic effects and morphologies of the isolated viruses and the sequence characteristics of the amplified gene fragments suggested that both agents were AvCoVs most similar to IBV. This was confirmed by serological ELISA evidence using IBV as the antigen and VN test using the isolate I0631/17. Since the original description of PhCoV in 1980 (Spackman and Cameron, 1983), the disease caused by PhCoV has become widespread in the UK (Lister et al., 1985; Pennycott, 2000; Cavanagh et al., 2002). Some viruses isolated from pheasants with respiratory disease, reduced egg production, renal problems, and high mortality were believed to be IBV (Spackman &Cameron, 1983; Gough et al., 1996; Lister et al., 1985; Pennycott, 2000), due to similarities with IBV in domestic fowl (Cook et al., 2012). The mortality associated with the outbreaks at pheasant farms in China were comparable to or even higher than those of the outbreak at a large game farm in the UK in 1994, which resulted in the deaths of over 1000 breeding pheasants out of a total stock of approximately 7000 birds (Gough et al., 1996). The clinical signs and gross lesions in dead birds were also similar between the two outbreaks, with upper respiratory signs at the beginning of the outbreaks, and the birds dying rapidly after appearance of the signs of illness. Pale, swollen kidneys and ureters distended with urates were also found in both cases. Some viruses have been successfully isolated and propagated in embryonating domestic fowl eggs (Lister et al., 1985; Gough et al., 1996), as with the two PhCoVs isolated in this study.",

The phylogenetic analyses were based on the S1 gene sequences of our PhCoVs and 213 reference AvCoV strains. The nucleotide and putative amino acid compositions of the S1 gene also showed approximately 10% differences between the two current PhCoVs isolates and other AvCoV strains, compared with 13% of nucleotides and 14% of amino acids in the S1 subdomain between IBV lineages, and 30% of nucleotides and 31% (occasionally even 40% or more) of amino acids in the S1 subdomain between IBV serotypes (Valastro et al., 2016). Our PhCoVs thus differed from IBV to a similar extent as one lineage of IBV differed from another. We also found interesting branching of the phylogenetic tree based on the complete genomic sequences of our two PhCoVs and IBVs of different lineages/genotypes. Pairwise comparisons of the complete genomic sequences revealed that our PhCoVs differed by >10%, similar to many IBV lineages and serotypes, further supporting the similarity of the genetic relationship between our two PhCoVs and IBV strains was similar to that between IBV lineages and genotypes. In addition, the robust IBV-specific serum IgG titers in chickens inoculated with PhCoV isolates showed that PhCoV infection stimulated a humoral response in chickens (Raj and Jones, 1997; Aston et al., 2018). However, PhCoVs were antigenically dissimilar to IBVs in the VN tests, suggesting that the antigenic relationship between our two PhCoVs and the IBV strains was similar to those between different IBV genotypes (Gao et al., 2016). Viruses antigenically distinct from the investigated IBVs have also been isolated from pheasants in the UK on several occasions (Lister et al., 1985; Cavanagh et al., 2002).",

            "text": "CoVs typically have a restricted host range and only infect their natural host. As an AvCoV, IBV is considered to be a highly contagious virus that only infects chickens (Gallus gallus) (Cavanagh, 2007); however, IBV has also been reported in other avian species including guinea fowl, partridge, peafowl, and teal, without producing any clinical detectable disease (Cavanagh, 2007; Liu et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2007). Pheasants (P. colchicus) differ from chickens (G. gallus), though both belong to the family Phasianidae, order Galliformes. Although the PhCoVs in this study were very similar to the IBVs, there were some obvious differences. The IBV RNA genome is characterized by the organization 5\u2032-UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-UTR-3\u2032, while the genomes of the PhCoV isolates were organized in a novel 5\u2032-UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-6-N-3\u2032UTR order, which differed from those of IBV and other AvCoVs. Novel genomic organizations have also been found in other IBVs (Liu et al., 2008a,b; Mardani et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2016) and experiments with engineered mutants suggested that the native order was not functionally essential (Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006). Notably, the current study found differences in the pathogenicity and replication capacity of the PhCoV isolates between chickens and pheasants. Intranasal instillation of 10 3-week-old SPF chickens with 0.2 ml of infectious allantoic fluid containing 103.2 EID50 of PhCoV previously failed to produce any clinical signs of disease (Lister et al., 1985). However, all birds had HI, but precipitating antibodies to IBV M41 strain. In this study, inoculation of chickens via the ocular and nasal routes with 0.1 ml of 105.0 EID50 of the PhCoV isolates I0623/17 and I0710/17 at 1, 30, and 45 days of age, respectively, also failed to produce any clinical signs of disease, while pheasants inoculated with I0710/17 showed obvious clinical signs and 30% mortality, similar to chickens infected with IBV strains (Liu and Kong, 2004). The clinical signs were similar to those in the affected commercial pheasants from which the viruses were isolated, and to those in chickens infected with IBV strains (Cavanagh, 2007). Furthermore, not all the inoculated chickens had ELISA-detected antibodies, compared with seroconversion of all pheasants inoculated with the PhCoV isolate. Strikingly, the viruses could be re-isolated from the tracheas of chickens inoculated with PhCoV isolates I0623/17 and I0710/17, but were absent or present at very low titers in other chicken tissues investigated in this study. In contrast, the PhCoV isolate I0710/17 could be re-isolated from, and had significantly higher viral titers in all pheasant tissues investigated in this study, especially the kidneys. These results were in line with the IHC results, which showed that viral antigen-positive epithelial cells were intensely labeled in the kidneys of pheasants challenged with I0710/17. These results were also consistent with those for viral replication and shedding, which indicated prolonged virus replication and higher number of birds shedding virus in the respiratory and digestive tracts of pheasants compared with chickens inoculated with PhCoVs. These findings support the different biological characteristics of PhCoVs compared with IBVs (Liu et al., 2008a,b).",

This hypothesis was confirmed, at least in part, by the analyses of S1 fragments from PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks and selected IBV strains. Instead of being clustered together and showing a close genetic relationship, the PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks in different years clustered in different groups, with each group showing a relatively close relationship with the IBVs circulating in the regions from which the respective PhCoVs were isolated. We speculated that the IBV strains may have been introduced into and adapted themselves in pheasants, and subsequently evolved independently to different extents resulting in different virulences in pheasants. For example, a previous report on the isolation of a PhCoV reported that the only notable clinical features were respiratory signs, reduced egg production, and shell-quality problems (Spackman and Cameron, 1983). However, the PhCoVs in the current and other studies showed a high affinity to the kidney (Gough et al., 1996; Lister et al., 1985; Pennycott, 2000) and were highly pathogenic in pheasants. The hypothesis that different introductions of the viruses from chickens to pheasants and the independent evolution of the resulting PhCoVs may account for the inconsistent phenotypes of the PhCoVs.",

This is suspected to have resulted in a host shift from chickens to turkeys, as well as switching the tissue tropism of the virus from the upper respiratory to the intestinal tract. In this study, we detected genome-wide differences, including point mutations, deletions, and insertions, in the ORFs and deduced protein sequences of our PhCoVs, compared with IBVs. The accumulation of substitutions in multiple genes in the PhCoV genome resulted in a host shift from chickens to pheasants, but did not lead to a change in tissue tropism (nephropathogenicity). In addition, we found no recombination events in the genomes of our PhCoVs compared with the IBV strains selected in this study. In contrast, different phylogenetic topologies were observed when the S1 fragments and 3\u2032UTRs of some of the PhCoVs isolated in UK were compared, suggesting that possible recombination events might have occurred. The different evolutionary patterns between our PhCoVs and those isolated in the UK might suggest that PhCoVs isolated in different outbreaks derived differently and have evolved independently.",

Genomic organization of PhCoV isolate I0623/17 (I0710/17) compared with AvCoVs TCoV MG10, IBV Beaudette, guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV) Fr2011, and Canada goose coronavirus (CGCoV) Cambridge_Bay_2017 (A). The names of the main virion genes are given. Genomes of five AvCoVs are drawn to different scales. Alignment of sequences encoding the ORF5 and flanking sequences of PhCoVs I0623/17, I0710/17 and IBV strains LDL/091022and 1148-A (B). A single mutation at the first site of the start codon corresponding to the IBV 5b (ATG\u2192ATT) resulted in absence of 5b in the PhCoV genome. A 90-nt insertion was found in the 5a\u2013ORF6 junction region in the PhCoVs. Analysis was also performed using SimPlot software version 3.5.1 to identify potential recombination breakpoints in the genomes of PhCoV isolates I0623/17 and I0710/17 (C). We used a 1000-bp window with a 50-bp step. Isolate I0710/17 was used as the query strain, and 39 selected IBV strains and one duck CoV were used as reference strains. The names of the main virion genes are given at the top of the SimPlot.",

The strains LDL/091022 and LJL/140734 (star) were used in the following VN tests. The complete genomic sequences of our two isolates I0623/17 and I0710/17 were also phylogenetically compared with those of 85 AvCoV reference strains, including 84 IBV strains and one duck CoV strain (B). The 40 sequences used for SimPlot analysis are shown in bold. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene fragments of PhCoV isolates I0623/17 and I0710/17 (black circle), nine PhCoV strains isolated in the UK (triangle), and 11 selected IBV strains (C).
