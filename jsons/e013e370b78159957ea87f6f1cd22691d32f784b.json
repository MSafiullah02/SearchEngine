They have also been proposed for the treatment of several viral infections, due to their anti-viral effects in cell cultures and animal models, and, currently, for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2) infection that is spreading all over the world. Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease. Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Given the role of iron in several human viral infections, we also propose a different insight into a number of CQ and HCQ pharmacological effects, suggesting a potential involvement of iron homeostasis in Sars-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 clinical course.",

These effects are particularly important in people suffering for underlying airway diseases, like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who undergo a respiratory viral infection, since these pathways are already turned on and aberrantly activated [22] . CQ has been shown to hinder viral infections through the inhibition of p38 MAPK activation [23, 24] .

The first published experimental evidence of the potential efficacy of CQ/HCQ in this disease comes from in vitro experiments. Wang and colleagues [8] results suggested that CQ could be more efficacious than HCQ. The authors also confirmed that CQ acts at both entry and post-entry stages and this double action was also observed for HCQ. In order to shed light on potential mechanisms of action of the drugs, the authors studied the cellular localization of viral particles and found virions partly in early endosomes (EEs) and more in late endosome-lysosomes (LELs) in control conditions. When cells were treated with CQ and HCQ, more viral particles were observed in EEs, suggesting that the drugs block endocytotic vesicle maturation at intermediate stages and probably stall the virus transport from EEs to LELs, a crucial step for the release of viral genome. The authors also observed that both CQ and HCQ treatments resulted in abnormally enlarged EEs, but while HCQ increased LEL size and number, CQ treatment induced no changes in number and size of LELs but the vesicle structure was disrupted, suggesting partially distinct mechanisms of action of the two drugs. The anti-Sars-Cov-2 in vitro action of CQ and HCQ was confirmed in the same cellular model by [10] . These authors found EC 50 values of 23.90 and 5.47 for CQ and 6.14 and 0.72 mM at 24 and 48h for CQ and HCQ respectively, that, in contrast with the previous report, was a better performance for HCQ. They also confirmed that the drugs have anti-viral activity also when administered prior to viral infection, with EC 50 values of >100, and 18.01 for CQ and 6.25 and 5.85 mM for HCQ respectively at 24 and 48h.",

            "text": "CQ/HCQ may impair the correct maturation and recognition of viral antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that require endosomal acidification for antigen processing. By phagocytosis and macropynocytosis, dendritic cells (DCs) capture pathogens, process and present their antigens to activate T cells. Through their antigen-specific B cell receptor and CME and clathrin-independent endocytosis, B cells recognize specific antigens and present their peptides to specific T cells. Through phagocytosis, CME, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, macrophages internalize pathogens, process their proteins and present antigens to T cells. T cells, through their antigen specific receptors, interact with APCs, recognizing antigenic peptides immobilized on their surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I (for CD8 + T cytotoxic cells) and MHC class II (for CD4 + T helper cells) molecules. MHC class I molecules are loaded with those antigens mainly derived from proteasome degradation of cytosolic proteins (like viral proteins) in the ER, but also from phagocytosed/endocytosed material, processed through endosomes and lysosomes. MHC class II molecules bind antigens obtained by endosomal and lysosomal processing and, as MHC class I, require the low pH of these organelles to activate protease and other enzymes and form the complexed antigen [27, 28] . CQ downregulates PICALM affecting CME and possibly antigen-processing [15] . CQ/HCQ also alkalinize vesicles of the endosome-lysosome-autophagy pathway, possibly further interfering with antigen presentation by APCs, both acting on antigen degradation and MHC molecules processing. The inhibition of antigen presentation may reduce T cell activation and differentiation and in turn decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLRs are involved in innate immunity against bacteria and viruses. TLR7 and TLR9 are located in the ER and move to endosomes and lysosomes where they recognize bacterial and viral nucleic acids. By this binding, their activation results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine like interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), type I interferons (IFN1s), interferon-\uf067 (IFN-\uf067) and cytokines promoting the stimulation of Th1 cells and disrupting the Th1/Th2 balance. The activation of TLR7 and TLR9 by their ligands requires the low pH of endosomes and lysosomes and an active autophagic pathway, then CQ/HCQ, through vesicle alkalinization, may inhibit this interaction and TLR signaling, in turn inhibiting the inflammatory response [31] . Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc endopeptidases that regulate inflammation and tissue repair at several levels. MMPs regulate pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production by proteolytic processing and may in turn be induced by cytokines and chemokines. CQ has been shown to downregulate MMP-9 expression through the inhibition of TLR9 signaling [32] .",

As mentioned above, CQ/HCQ could inhibit phospholipase A2 and decrease arachidonic acid, prostaglandin and tromboxane release [33, 77] . When administered within 48h before surgery, HCQ induces the increase of fibrinogen causing a decrease of plasmatic and blood viscosity [78] .

Several cells other than hepatocytes have been demonstrated to produce and release HAMP that can act as autocrine and paracrine molecule, modulating local iron homeostasis [95, 96] . Not only cells of the immune system like lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages (including alveolar macrophages) but also airway epithelial cells have been demonstrated to produce HAMP during infection and inflammation and potentially contribute to lung injury [97] [98] [99] . HAMP is also a peptide involved in innate antimicrobial immunity and an acute phase protein [100] . Further acute phase iron-related proteins like transferrin (Tf), lactoferrin (LF), ferritin (FT), haptoglobin (HP) and hemopexin (HPX) are modulated by viral infections, further underlining the crucial role of iron in anti-viral host defense. The role of iron metabolism has been thoroughly investigated in several human viral infections. For extensive reviews on this topic and for details on systemic and cellular iron metabolism, please refer to [2] [3] [4] 101] . CQ/HCQ have been shown to modulate iron metabolism, impairing its homeostasis at different levels [43, 102] , and to decrease inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1\uf062 and TNF-\uf061. Here we summarize the more striking evidences on CQ/HCQ action on cellular iron trafficking and their impact on cellular and systemic iron metabolism. We further propose alternative modes of action for these drugs, currently used in the treatment of COVID-19, that might also work through the interference with local and/or systemic iron metabolism, restricting this essential element in infected cells and/or immune cells involved in virus clearance and/or acting on virus cell cycle (Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "Direct infection of innate and adaptive immune cells has been described in some coronavirus infections [118, 119] , then iron starvation could also possibly inhibit these infections. Resident macrophages can polarize under the stimuli of cytokines in classically activated pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1), induced by interferon-\uf067 (IFN-\uf067) and TNF-\uf061 or, under interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 13 (IL-13) stimuli, alternatively activated macrophages (M2), involved in pathogen clearance, tissue repair and inflammation reduction. While M2 macrophages have low iron levels, M1 macrophages are characterized by iron retention, secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, produce high amounts of radicals to kill pathogens and produce HAMP that acts in an autocrine manner to minimize iron exit. Increased iron deposition in macrophages has been shown to induce M1 polarization and the persistence of a pro-inflammatory state due to an incomplete switch to M2 state [121] . Iron retention in macrophages could then favor intracellular virus life cycle in the case of their infection and further promote the process of inflammation, while iron starvation could result in the opposite effects. Further, iron excess in macrophages favors secondary infections with other J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f microbes. Chronic administration of CQ has been shown to decrease iron content in a rat model. Legssyer and colleagues [1232, 123] showed that CQ decreased iron content in the liver of control, iron-loaded and iron-deficient rats, in the spleen of control and iron-loaded animals and, importantly, in alveolar macrophages of iron-loaded rats. They also interestingly observed that CQ treatment of primary cultures of alveolar macrophages obtained from all three groups of rats and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significatively reduced the oxidative response, measured by NO 2 release, suggesting that CQ might prevent infections, particularly those associated with diseases characterized by iron overload, through limiting iron availability not only in infected cells but also in macrophages, in turn reducing inflammation. However, heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) reduce the CQ effect of iron removal in porphyria cutanea tarda [124] . Also in murine models, CQ has been shown to decrease macrophage activation syndrome (hemophagocytic syndrome) induced by pristane, by reducing macrophage infiltration, phagocytic functions, cytokine production and reducing FT, lactate dehydrogenase and triglyceride levels [125] . Although immune cells need iron for their proliferation and activation, excess iron has also been reported to impair antigen processing and presentation by APCs, suppress CD4 + cells and alter CD4 + /CD8 + lymphocyte ratio, increase circulating immunoglobulin-producing B cells, reduce natural killer (NK) cell lysing efficiency and perturb complement activation [126] , while iron deficiency has an immunosuppressive effect on T cells [127] . Then, CQ/HCQ treatment, through their action on iron homeostasis, could possibly have also a broad role in the modulation of the adaptive response to Sars-Cov-2.",

            "text": "A third important point to highlight derives from the inhibitory action of CQ/HCQ on IL-1\uf062, TNF-\uf061 and IL-6 release. First, TNF-\u03b1 acts on iron homeostasis, reducing intestinal iron absorption and blocking iron recycling from macrophages, then inducing iron retention in these cells and their polarization to M1 proinflammatory phenotype [102] . Conversely, CQ inhibits TNF-\uf061 acting also through the induction of cellular iron starvation [40] . Then, the inhibition of the cytokine by CQ/HCQ, also through their effect on iron homeostasis, could alleviate inflammation, restoring a balanced systemic iron homeostasis and rescuing erythropoiesis. Secondly, IL-1\uf062, TNF-\uf061 and IL-6 as stated above, induce the systemic and local release of HAMP. Iron is essential for life, but excess iron is toxic, due to its redox potential that can hamper oxidative stress damaging crucial cellular components. Iron availability is then tightly regulated both at the cellular and systemic levels [2-4, 95, 101] . The main systemic regulator is HAMP. This hormone peptide is produced mainly in the liver and is regulated by circulating and tissue iron levels through the bone J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f morphogenetic/small mother against decapentaplegic (BMP/SMAD) pathway in such a way that iron load induces while iron deficiency inhibits its expression, mainly acting on intestinal iron absorption and iron retention/release by macrophages and hepatocytes. HAMP expression is also downregulated by hypoxia and erythropoietin (EPO) through erythroferrone (ERFE) to allow iron mobilization for erythropoiesis, while it is upregulated by inflammation. IL-6 is the main signal that induce HAMP during inflammation, through the JAK/STAT3 pathway in association with the BMP/SMAD pathway, but also IL-1\uf062 and TNF-\uf061\uf020 have a direct role on HAMP regulation [95, 128, 129] . As stated above, CQ/HCQ not only interfere with cellular iron inducing its starvation in alveolar macrophages [122, 123] , then possibly resulting in a switch to M2 antiinflammatory state, but also inhibit IL-6, IL-1\uf062 and TNF-\uf061 release, possibly reducing local HAMP release by macrophages. This reduction can result in further decreased iron retention in these cells allowing direction towards inflammation resolution. Further, cytokine decrease could result in systemic HAMP decrease that, through increased intestinal iron absorption, may ameliorate anemia of infection. Interestingly EPO treatment has recently been found to attenuate COVID-19 severe symptoms [130] while, through in silico modeling, Sars-Cov-2 has been found to possibly bind heme dissociating iron from porphyrin [131] .",

Through several signaling pathways, TNF-\uf061 controls vasodilation, infiltration and adhesion of leukocytes at the site of inflammation, complement and coagulation cascade activation, respiratory burst in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and it is also a pyrogenic cytokine. TNF-\uf061 up-regulation has also been observed in coronavirus infections other than Sars-Cov-2[48, 49]  and seems to play a keyrole in lung injury [50]. IL-1\uf062 is expressed in a tightly regulated way by myeloid cells and released by the inflammasome. This cytokine promotes neutrophil recruitment and Th17 differentiation [51]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking IL-1\uf062 pathway has been proposed to treat COVID-19 [52]. IL-6 plays a crucial role in COVID-19, particularly in the related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm that can lead to death [34]. Preliminary clinical data with mAbs blocking IL-6 have demonstrated a certain degree of efficacy in severe COVID-19 patients [53] and in some single cases [54,55], but these pilot results needs further clinical data and well-planned clinical trial on the efficacy of this treatment, especially considering timing of treatment since, as suggested by Mc Gonagle and colleagues [34], this aspect could be crucial for the following proper tissue repair. IL-6 is produced in response to tissue damage and infections by several cell types, including B and T cells, monocytes, DCs, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The cytokine activates the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) signal transduction pathway that pleiotropically controls multiple downstream associated genes, having however both pro-and anti-inflammatory effects. IL-6 promotes Th2 cell response and inhibits Th1 polarization, induces cytolytic activity of CD8 + T cells, regulates acute phase protein production in the liver, promotes hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation, organizes migration and phagocytic activities of macrophages and accumulation of neutrophils at sites of infection or trauma, increases immunoglobulin G (IgG) production by B cells, suppresses some viral infection, orchestrates tissue remodeling and repair. On the other hand, cytotoxic activities of CD8 + T cells may also be negatively regulated by IL-6. IL-6 can induce Th17 cell differentiation that both acts in pathogen defense and viral persistence, while inhibiting T reg cell functions. Excessive IL-6 production may increase inflammation and exacerbate tissue injury. Some microorganisms can up-regulate IL-6 as an immune evasion strategy [56].",

Efficacy was evaluated by quantification of viral copies in the cell supernatant by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis for virus nucleoprotein (NP). The authors found that CQ blocked infection at both entry and post-entry steps (drug added 2h before viral treatment, western blot performed after 14h). The same researchers [9] later compared HCQ and CQ efficacies in the same cell model and found that cytotoxicity was not significantly different between the two drugs. Measuring anti-viral efficacy at different MOIs (0.01, 0.02, 0.2, 0.8) by RT-PCR they observed lower E 50 values for CQ at all MOIs (2.71, 3.81, 7.14, 7.36 for CQ and 4.51, 4.06, 17.31, 12.96 for HCQ), confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis for NP.
