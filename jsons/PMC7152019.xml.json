They have the largest RNA genomes of all known viruses. Feline coronaviruses (FCoV), like canine enteric coronavirus, belong to the Group 1a coronaviruses (see Box 17-1). In fact, even canine enteric coronavirus has the potential to infect cats and cause diseases similar to those caused by FCoV.2 Among FCoVs, there are two different serotypes, type I and type II, which use different receptors for cellular entry in vitro3., 4. but cause the same clinical manifestations. Type I strains predominate worldwide.5., 6., 7. Type II strains, which are thought to have evolved from genetic recombination between canine enteric coronavirus and FCoV, are more readily grown in culture and so have been more extensively studied; they possess a spike protein that resembles that of canine enteric coronavirus.",

            "text": "FCoVs cause enteric disease in cats as well as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a serious systemic pyogranulomatous to granulomatous disease that progresses over a period of weeks to months and, once it occurs, is ultimately always fatal. FIP is a major cause of death in young and young adult cats, especially cats from multicat environments such as purebred catteries and shelters. Wild cats, especially cheetahs, are also susceptible.8 The vast majority of domestic cats that develop FIP are 3 months to 3 years of age, with at least 50% of affected cats aged 12 months or younger (Figure 20-1\n). However, FIP can occur at any age, and there is a secondary peak of incidence in geriatric cats (>10 years of age), possibly as a result of suboptimal immune function. Males and sexually intact cats have been predisposed in some studies,9., 10., 11. and a disease peak may exist in the fall and winter.12 Although the disease occurs in all breeds, purebred cats are more susceptible; Abyssinians, Australian mist, Bengals, birmans, Burmese, British shorthairs, Himalayans, ragdolls, rexes, and possibly Scottish folds may be predisposed.9., 10., 11., 12., 13., 14. Breed predispositions may vary geographically and temporally depending on the preferences of breeders in a region, and specific lines may be more predisposed than the breeds themselves.6 The molecular basis of genetic susceptibility to FIP is currently unclear. Siblings of cats that die of FIP may be at increased risk for FIP.15\n",

            "text": "In multiple-cat household situations, cats are repeatedly infected, shed virus, and recover, but some cats remain persistently infected and chronically shed FCoV in the absence of clinical signs (Figure 20-2\n). More than half, and as many as 100% of cats in environments with more than six cats, become infected with FCoVs.6 The seroprevalence is lower in cats from single-cat households and among feral cats.16 However, even though the prevalence of infection in multicat households is high, fewer than 10% of cats from large, multicat households ultimately develop FIP. Thus, although the incidence of infection is high, the incidence of disease in single- or two-cat households is only around 1 in 5000; in catteries it is around 5% to 10%.17., 18. Provided they are unrelated by birth, cats in households with a history of FIP are not more likely to develop FIP than cats in households without FIP.19 Thus, FIP is usually a sporadic disease that does not spread from one cat to another. However, every few years, epidemics of disease can occur in catteries or shelters, with mortality rates that exceed 10%.12 Because it is an enveloped virus, FCoV is readily inactivated by disinfectants and generally survives less than a day or two at room temperature. However, the possibility of prolonged survival (up to 7 weeks) in the environment under certain conditions has been suggested.15., 20. In this situation, fomites might play an important role in transmission.",

            "text": "The epidemiology and pathogenesis of FIP has both fascinated and confused veterinary virologists worldwide for decades. The most widely accepted theory (the \u201cinternal mutation hypothesis\u201d) is that cats are initially infected with a low-pathogenicity coronavirus after oronasal exposure, which results either in no signs, or mild enteric disease. This low-pathogenicity virus has been referred to as feline enteric coronavirus in some publications in order to distinguish it from virulent FIP virus. The use of this name has been controversial, because although the virus is primarily confined to the gastrointestinal tract (and especially colonic epithelial cells), FCoV RNA can also be found in blood and tissue macrophages of cats that do not have FIP.21., 22. In some infected cats, the low-pathogenicity virus is believed to mutate to a virulent strain that can multiply within macrophages without hindrance by the immune system and incite a systemic pyogranulomatous vasculitis. The mutation may occur shortly after initial infection, or years later, which may explain why some indoor cats from single-cat households develop FIP several years after they are acquired. Virulent strains may not be able to replicate effectively within the gut,23 which may be the reason why cat-to-cat transmission of FIP does not occur, yet the disease can be transmitted effectively by inoculating na\u00efve cats with effusion from a cat with FIP. Factors that contribute to immunosuppression, such as concurrent viral infection, stress due to overcrowding, surgery, or transport, and especially genetic factors may allow viral replication and mutation to proceed unchecked. Simultaneous immune compromise of a large number of cats, such as in a shelter situation, may explain epidemics of FIP. Other risk factors for FIP include regular introduction of new cats to a cattery and the proportion of cats in a cattery that shed coronavirus chronically.12 There is no distinct mutation that allows avirulent FCoV strains to be differentiated from virulent strains, and therefore no diagnostic test exists that distinguishes FIP from benign FCoV strains. However, mutations in the spike protein gene,24., 25. membrane protein gene,26 and the nonstructural 3c and 7b genes23., 27., 28., 29. may play a role. In particular, the 3c gene appears to be disrupted in many (but not all) virulent FCoV strains.",

Replication of virulent FCoV strains within macrophages results in two forms of disease, which reflect the immune response mounted by the host. FIP is an immune complex disease. Noneffusive (\u201cdry\u201d) FIP occurs in cats that mount a partial CMI response and is characterized by pyogranulomatous to granulomatous inflammation within a variety of organs, but especially the mesenteric lymph nodes, kidneys, liver, lungs, brain, and eye. Solitary or multifocal granulomas of the intestinal wall also occasionally develop, especially in the region of the ileocecal junction (Figure 20-3\n).15\nEffusive (\u201cwet\u201d) FIP occurs in cats that are unable to mount an immune response and is characterized by accumulation of high protein exudates in the thorax and/or abdomen, which typically contain low numbers of cells. Production of vascular endothelial growth factor by infected monocytes may be lead to increased vascular permeability and contribute to cavitary effusion.35 Many cats have a mixture of both forms of the disease, and noneffusive disease may progress to effusive disease. Infection itself results in immune dysregulation, with a profound, virus-induced depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells; production of TNF-\u03b1, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by infected macrophages; impaired IFN-\u03b3 production; and hypergammaglobulinemia.36., 37., 38. The mechanism of T-cell depletion is not clear, as the virus does not infect lymphocytes, only monocytes and macrophages. Infection of antigen-presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells, has been hypothesized to lead to T-cell apoptosis. Progressive immune system failure may be associated with a conversion to predominantly effusive disease manifestations. Despite the profound T-cell deficiency that accompanies FIP, opportunistic infections are rarely reported. Nevertheless, concurrent infections with retroviruses and Toxoplasma gondii and opportunistic bacterial infections can occur;6 the author is aware of one cat that was co-infected with Sporothrix schenckii.\n",

The most common signs are lethargy and inappetence, as well as a fluctuating fever that does not respond to antibacterial drug treatment. Nevertheless, many cats are bright, appetent, and in good body condition early in the course of illness. Some cats have increased thirst and urination, possibly secondary to pyrexia. Ultimately, weight loss develops, but owners of cats that develop abdominal distention may mistake the distention for weight gain or pregnancy. Stunted growth may occur in affected kittens. Pleural effusion may be associated with tachypnea and respiratory distress. Testicular enlargement may occur in cats with serositis that involves the tunica vaginalis. FIP is responsible for approximately 10% of pericardial effusions in cats, the third most common cause of pericardial effusion after cardiomyopathy and neoplasia.39 Rarely, pericardial effusion results in cardiac tamponade. Pyogranulomatous or granulomatous inflammation may lead to mesenteric lymphadenomegaly, irregular renomegaly, intestinal masses, hepatomegaly, icterus, pneumonia, uveitis, chorioretinitis, and, rarely, nodular skin lesions. Neurologic signs, which can include focal or generalized seizures, occur in at least 10% of cats with FIP and result primarily from meningoencephalitis, meningomyelitis, ependymitis, choroiditis, and obstructive hydrocephalus. Obstructive hydrocephalus occurs secondary to choroiditis and ependymitis (Figure 20-4\n). In one study, FIP was responsible for almost half of all neurologic disease in 97 cats due to infectious or inflammatory causes.40 Occasionally profound anemia occurs secondary to immune-mediated hemolysis13., 14. or possibly microangiopathic damage, whereby erythrocytes are lysed as they travel through inflamed blood vessels. Immune-mediated glomerulonephritis has also been reported, and FIP should always be considered in cats with protein-losing nephropathy, which is otherwise rare in cats.41 Uncommonly, lameness occurs as a result of synovitis.6\n",

For example, some laboratories use related coronaviruses as a source of antigen for the test, rather than FCoV.15 Use of a reliable laboratory that reports quantitative titers (to the endpoint dilution, as well as down to 1:100) is critical. Even when performed correctly, a positive FCoV antibody titer is not diagnostic for FIP, because cats that have been exposed to avirulent FCoV strains or even other related coronaviruses are also seropositive. Therefore, serology is a \u201ccoronavirus antibody test\u201d and not an \u201cFIP test.\u201d It has been suggested that more cats have been killed as a result of misinterpretation of FCoV antibody tests than by the disease itself.20 Certainly a diagnosis of FIP should never be made based on the presence of nonspecific clinical or laboratory abnormalities such as fever or leukocytosis and a positive coronavirus antibody test. Occasionally (up to 10% of the time), cats with advanced disease are seronegative, because of failure of antibody production with severe immunosuppression, or the complexing of antibody by the large quantities of virus present. In one study, titers of 1:1600 or higher were highly suggestive (94% chance) of FIP in the presence of compatible clinical signs.44 In addition, strong positive titers (e.g., \u2265 1:6400) in cats with consistent signs and laboratory abnormalities support a diagnosis of FIP if a cat resides in a household that contains only one or two cats, because cats often become seronegative within a few months once they are removed from households that contain large numbers of cats.",

The goal of treatment is to prolong life span and improve quality of life through reduction of inflammation and supportive care. The most effective treatment known is prednisolone, administration of which results in temporary remissions in some cats (Table 20-6\n). Other immunosuppressive drugs, such as chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide, have been used in addition to prednisolone, but whether these drugs improve outcome is unknown, and they have the potential to be toxic. A variety of immunomodulators and antiviral drugs have been tried, such as ribavirin and oral and parenteral human recombinant IFN-\u03b1, but none have convincingly shown benefit in vivo. Prolonged remissions were reported in several cats treated with a combination of glucocorticoids and feline IFN-\u03c9,56 but a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial reported no effect of feline IFN-\u03c9.57 Other drugs used to treat cats with FIP include the immunomodulatory drugs pentoxifylline and Polyprenyl Immunostimulant (see Chapter 7)58; ozagrel hydrochloride, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor59; and the antiviral drug nelfinavir.14., 60. Controlled clinical trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of these treatments. Because FIP is an immune-mediated disease, nonspecific immune stimulation has the potential to cause harm. The use of small interfering RNA molecules, which bind viral RNA and prevent viral replication, has recently shown promising results in vitro.61 Cyclosporin inhibits FIPV replication in vitro;62 studies are required to determine if cyclosporin treatment benefits infected cats or whether harm results from immunosuppression.",

Currently, an intranasal, temperature-sensitive mutant serotype II FIP virus vaccine is available on the market, but its use has been controversial.

It is licensed for administration from 16 weeks of age, by which time most kittens have already been exposed to FCoV.

Methods to control FIP in cattery situations, such as identification and removal of chronic shedders with serial fecal RT-PCR assays and removal of kittens from the queen followed by isolation at 5 to 6 weeks of age (before maternal antibody has declined), have limitations and are difficult to achieve properly in large catteries.20 For example, cats that do not shed FCoV may still be infected with avirulent FCoV strains, and shedding may recommence at a later date.22 Isolation of kittens may be useful if reexposure is prevented until after they are 16 weeks of age, when their immune system is more mature.6 In shelter situations, FIP may be reduced when overcrowding and prolonged stays are minimized, especially during kitten season.6 If possible, owners that adopt cats from shelter environments should be provided with a handout that provides basic information on the disease (and other major infectious diseases of shelter cats such as retrovirus infections, bartonellosis, and feline upper respiratory tract disease) and the ubiquitous nature of infection.",

            "text": "There is no evidence that humans can become infected with FCoV. The closest human coronavirus relative is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Other coronaviruses cause FIP-like disease in nonfelids such as ferrets and mice. If a coronavirus emerged that could cause similar clinical manifestations and outcomes in humans as FIPV can in cats, it would represent a major threat to humans and would be the subject of intense research.CASE EXAMPLESignalment\u201cRicky\u201d, a 9-month-old male castrated domestic shorthair from Sacramento, CAHistoryRicky was brought to a local veterinary clinic because of increased thirst and urination. A serum chemistry panel showed hyperglobulinemia (7.7 mg/dL), and urinalysis showed a specific gravity (SGr) of 1.025 with an inactive sediment; aerobic bacterial urine culture was negative. Three days later, Ricky became inappetent and was returned to the local veterinary clinic. Laboratory abnormalities included mature neutrophilia (11,904 cells/\u00b5L), lymphocytosis (5104 cells/\u00b5L), eosinophilia (1536 cells/\u00b5L), hyperglobulinemia (6.9 mg/dL), and hypoalbuminemia (2.4 mg/dL). A feline coronavirus antibody titer was 1:400. Serology for Toxoplasma gondii was negative. Plain thoracic radiographs showed a mild interstitial pattern. Abdominal ultrasound showed mesenteric lymphadenomegaly, and an aspirate of the lymph nodes showed lymphoid reactivity. Treatment with cyproheptadine was initiated, and Ricky\u2019s appetite recovered, after which treatment was discontinued. For the 3 weeks that followed, the cat had been appetent and energetic, but occasional soft feces had been noticed in the litter box. The owners were concerned about the possibility of FIP.Ricky was obtained at 3 months of age from a rescue group, who rescued him as an 8-week-old stray kitten. As a kitten he had multiple upper respiratory tract infections, but since adoption he had been healthy and shared a household with one other cat. He was an indoor cat that was sometimes walked briefly outdoors. He was fed commercial dry and wet cat food.Physical ExaminationBody Weight4.2 kgGeneralBright, alert and responsive, hydrated.

These changes were consistent with the acute-phase inflammatory response.Imaging FindingsAbdominal ultrasound: The spleen was moderately enlarged. There was diffuse mesenteric lymphadenopathy (see Figure 20-8, B).Mesenteric Lymph Node Aspirate CytologyIntact nucleated cells were composed of a heterogenous population of lymphocytes, predominated by small, mature lymphocytes. Lower numbers of intermediate and large reactive lymphocytes, moderate numbers of mildly degenerate neutrophils, and scattered plasma cells and histiocytes were noted. Immunocytochemistry using two different monoclonal antibodies against FCoV was negative, but macrophages were low in number.Microbiologic TestingFeLV antigen and FIV antibody serology: negativeSerology (IFA) and blood culture for Bartonella clarridgeiae and Bartonella henselae: negativeSerology (IFA) for vector-borne diseases: negative for antibodies to Ehrlichia canis, Neorickettsia risticii, Anaplasma spp., and Rickettsia spp.PCR for FCoV (whole blood): negativePCR panel for other bloodborne pathogens (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Bartonella spp., E. canis, N. risticii, Mycoplasma haemofelis): negativeAerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture of mesenteric lymph node aspirate: negativeSerology for FCoV: positive at 1:102,400DiagnosisA tentative diagnosis of FIP was made on the basis of Ricky\u2019s background, the marked polyclonal gammopathy, and the strongly positive coronavirus titer.Treatment and OutcomeBiopsy of the enlarged mesenteric node was offered, but the owners declined. Ricky was treated with prednisolone (5 mg PO q12h for 7 days, followed by 5 mg PO q24h thereafter), chlorambucil (2 mg PO every 3 days), and pentoxifylline (50 mg PO q8h). Six weeks later, the cat was well and CBC variables within reference ranges. Serum total protein concentration was 8.5 g/dL, with a globulin concentration of 4.5 g/dL. Abdominal ultrasound examination showed persistent but mild mesenteric lymphadenomegaly (0.5 to 0.75 cm in diameter). A feline coronavirus titer was 1:25,600. Treatment with feline interferon-\u03c9 was commenced (4.5 million units SC once weekly). Ricky was seen again 3 months later, at which time he continued to be playful and appetent, with a stable body weight of 4.5 kg. A CBC showed mild anemia (HCT 29%), a neutrophil count of 4439 cells/\u00b5L, and lymphopenia (468 cells/\u00b5L). A chemistry panel and abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Chlorambucil and interferon-\u03c9 were discontinued. The next time the cat was reexamined was 12 months after the onset of illness, at which time he continued to be apparently healthy. CBC findings were unchanged, and the serum globulin concentration was 4.7 g/dL. The prednisolone dose was decreased to 5 mg q48h and pentoxifylline treatment was discontinued. One month later, albumin and globulin concentrations were 3.3 and 5.1 g/dL, respectively, and the prednisolone dose was reduced to 2.5 mg q48h. At the next 1-month recheck, a CBC was unremarkable but globulin was 5.7 g/dL. Abdominal ultrasound showed mildly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and the serum coronavirus antibody titer was 1:409,600. The prednisolone dose was increased to 5 mg PO q24h; 1 month later, the serum globulin concentration was 4.9 g/dL. One and a half years after the onset of illness, Ricky was still apparently healthy according to the owner, but a midabdominal mass was palpated on physical examination, and the serum globulin concentration had increased again (5.6 g/dL). Abdominal ultrasound showed several moderately enlarged and hypoechoic lymph nodes in the ileocolic region, the largest of which was 0.9 cm in diameter. The surrounding mesentery was focally hyperechoic. There was also focal hyperechoic retroperitoneal tissue surrounding the right kidney with scant retroperitoneal fluid. Attempts to obtain aspirates from the lymph nodes were unsuccessful. The prednisolone dose was increased to 5mg PO q12h, and treatment with chlorambucil and pentoxifylline was reinstituted.One week later, Ricky developed lethargy and inappetence. A CBC showed macrocytic anemia (HCT 24.3%, MCV 57.2 fL) and lymphopenia (782 cells/\u00b5L). A serum chemistry panel showed only hyperglobulinemia (5.8 g/dL). FeLV and FIV serology was repeated and was again negative, and the coronavirus antibody titer was 1:25,600. Treatment with cyproheptadine was initiated and the chlorambucil and pentoxifylline discontinued. However, inappetence continued, and persistent pyrexia (103.4\u00b0 to 104\u00b0F), hematochezia, and tachypnea developed over the next few days. The hematocrit dropped to 16.5%, and hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia were identified. Ricky was hospitalized and treated with 1 unit of packed RBC, IV crystalloids, and parenteral antimicrobial drugs. Thoracic radiographs showed a severe, diffuse, patchy alveolar and nodular interstitial pattern with thickening of the bronchial walls and mild pleural effusion (see Figure 20-7). A tracheobronchial lavage showed marked mixed, predominantly pyogranulomatous inflammation with moderate epithelial hyperplasia and some degenerate neutrophils (see Figure 20-9). Immunocytochemistry with an anti-FCoV antibody was strongly positive in macrophages. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures of the wash specimen were negative. The cat subsequently seizured and was euthanized.Necropsy FindingsNecropsy showed moderate to severe, multifocal to coalescing pyogranulomatous capsulitis and serositis that involved the spleen, liver, kidney, intestines, diaphragm, thoracic and abdominal walls, and pericardium. There was also multifocal pyogranulomatous splenitis, hepatitis, nephritis, meningoencephalitis, and pneumonia with necrosis. Straw-colored effusion was present in the abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity, and pleural space. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for FCoV antigen (see Figure 20-11).CommentsThe course of disease and survival time (587 days) in this cat was unusually prolonged for FIP, and on many occasions the diagnosis was questioned. However, the persistently increased FCoV antibody titer in a cat that lived with only one other cat raised suspicion for the disease. Chronic, smoldering FIP may be more common than recognized.6 The initial clinical signs in this cat were mild and may have been overlooked by some owners. Although the cat appeared to respond to prednisolone treatment, it was not known whether the other medications used had any effect. Ultimately, disease progressed, and a diagnosis of FIP was confirmed with immunocytochemistry on the tracheobronchial lavage specimen. Although effusion developed, the amount was too low to permit collection of the fluid for analysis. The initial negative PCR and immunocytochemistry results may have reflected the presence of low quantities of virus.\n",
