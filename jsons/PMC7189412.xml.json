They can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta and gamma, out of which alpha and beta coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to infect humans (de Wilde et al., 2018). They are circulated among humans, other mammals, and birds and can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurologic diseases (Weiss & Leibowitz, 2011; Zhu et al., 2020). Even though the majority of human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of two betacoronaviruses (\u03b2CoV), namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has caused more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV (World Health Organization, 2019). In late December 2019, several local health facilities reported groups of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, and they were found to be epidemiologically connected with the Huanan wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (Huang et al., 2020). Next-generation sequencing analysis from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from the patients indicated a novel human-infecting coronavirus (Huang et al., 2020), officially named Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (World Health Organization, 2020a). Also, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has officially named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (World Health Organization, 2020a).",

            "text": "As of 29 March 2020, there have been more than 652,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across 177 countries/regions, with 30,300 fatalities. China, Italy and Spain have been the most affected countries with combined fatalities of more than 19,100 patients (Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020). On 11 March, the WHO has officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020c). Earlier, on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (World Health Organization, 2020e). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO, the global death rate has been 3.4% (World Health Organization, 2020b), but it varies significantly with the age of the patients (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). In order to control the menace caused by SARS-CoV-2, we suggest two of its indispensable druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase and 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase (Benkert et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2003). 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) is a cysteine protease present in the Coronavirus replicase polyprotein. This protease plays a central role in viral replication and transcription functions through extensive proteolysis of two replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Yang et al., 2003). It cleaves at least 11 inter-domain sites on the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins to generate individual functional proteins, including an RNA-directed RNA polymerase, a helicase, an exoribonuclease, an endoribonuclease and a 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase. Also, it is excised from polyproteins by its proteolytic activity and forms a homodimer with one active site per subunit (Yang et al., 2003). All of these features of 3CLpro makes it a principal drug target for SARS-CoV-2.",

Most viral mRNAs possess a 5\u2032-terminal cap structure (m7GpppN) which is essential for efficient splicing, nuclear export, translation and stability (Chen et al., 2011). This structure undergoes methylation catalysed by 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase at the ribose 2\u2032-O position of the first and second nucleotide of the mRNA(Chen et al., 2011; Lugari et al., 2010). Nsp 16 encodes the 2\u2032-OMTase which provides the viral mRNA with the ability to camouflage and obscure itself from the host cell, thus preventing recognition and activation of the host immune response which is essential for successful viral infection (Menachery et al., 2014). This protein can, therefore, act as another potential drug target for the SARS-CoV-2.",

Homology modelling of these proteins was performed using SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018) with the user template option. Template structures were selected from Protein BLAST (Camacho et al., 2009) against Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000) based on query coverage, percentage of sequence identity and crystal structure resolution. Energy minimisation of modelled proteins was achieved using YASARA (Krieger et al., 2009) and GalaxyWEB (Ko et al., 2012) web servers. Model evaluation was performed before and after minimisation using Structure Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) v5.0 meta server (UCLA MBI), which includes ERRAT (Colovos & Yeates, 1993), Verify-3D (Luthy et al., 1992) and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) programmes.",

One hundred twenty-three entries belonging to the category of antiviral drugs were downloaded from DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2018) and were subsequently converted into a single structure data file (SDF) library (see supplementary data, Table 3). AutoDockVina (Trott & Olson, 2009) docking wizard inbuilt in PyRx was utilised for all of the docking calculations. In PyRx, blind docking with the exhaustiveness 32 option was used to carry out the virtual screening and docking of antiviral drugs against 3CLpro (Grid Box: center_x = 75.98, center_y = \u221215.53, center_z = 18.01, size_x = 70.46, size_y = 90.53, size_z = 61.34) and 2\u2032-OMTase (Grid Box: center_x = 64.12, center_y = 70.35, center_z = 71.46, size_x = 67.11, size_y = 66.13, size_z = 68.36). Once we got the results obtained from virtual screening, we selected two drug molecules for each protein based on the estimated binding free energy (\u0394G), estimated inhibition constant (Ki), their orientation at the catalytic site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were further subjected to MD simulations for understanding the structural stability of protein-drug complexes at the long-interval.",

MD simulation was performed using GROMACS 2019 (Abraham et al.) with GROMOS96 43a1 force field parameters (Chiu et al., 2009). The topology of the drug molecules was created using PRODRG webserver (Schuttelkopf & van Aalten, 2004). The simulation of all of the proteins and protein-drug complexes were run for a period of 100 ns. To make the system electrostatically neutral, counter ions were added to the protein-drug complexes. The complexes were solvated within 10 \u00c5 SPC/E water cube (Berendsen et al., 1987). The protein-drug complexes were minimised in multiple steps using steepest descent method, where minimisation of the whole system, water cube and non-heavy atoms of the complexes were accomplished. The entire systems were then progressively heated up to 300 K on a time scale of 100 ps. The equilibration steps were performed in two different phases, one with constant pressure and temperature (NPT) and the other with steady volume and temperature (NVT). Various structural parameters, like Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on essential dynamics (ED) approach, Inter-molecular Hydrogen Bonding (H-bonding) and Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) were calcualted as a function of time to explore the structural behaviour of the proteins and protein-drug complexes.",

            "text": "Homology modelling is one of the standard in silico procedures, which allows predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein molecule based on experimentally solved homologous structures known as structural templates (Bordoli et al., 2009). Sequence identity and Query coverage are two crucial parameters to identify the suitable structural templates for homology modelling technique. Moreover, the 3D structure of the target protein is essential to explore its function (Micheletti, 2013). The 3D models of 3CLpro and 2\u2032-OMTase were predicted using SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018). For the best results, we used the user-defined template option present in SWISS-MODEL. Protein BLAST (Camacho et al., 2009) results were taken into account for the selection of suitable template structures. The X-ray crystal structure of 3CLpro from Human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) solved at 1.9 \u00c5 (PDB ID: 1UJ1) resolution was selected as the template for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. For 2\u2032-OMTase, we used a 2 \u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of nsp10/nsp16 complex (PDB ID: 3R24) of SARS-CoV. The template (PDB ID: 1UJ1) was selected because it has 96.08% sequence identity and 100% query coverage towards SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Also, the template (PDB ID: 3R24) has a sequence identity of 93.29% and query coverage of 100% against SARS-CoV-2. In SWISS-MODEl, Global Model Quality Estimation (GMQE) (Waterhouse et al., 2018) score of 0.99 out of 1 and QMEAN (Benkert et al., 2011) score of 0.09 was achieved for 3CLpro, whereas for 2\u2032-OMTase, GMQE score was 0.97 out of 1, and QMEAN score was \u22122.57. These quality estimations depict the reliability of the modelled protein structure, target\u2013template alignment and the template search method. It is also worth noting that 3CLpro makes a homodimeric structure, but since only one protomer is active in each dimer, we only modelled the single protomer, and further used it for in silico interaction or molecular docking and MD simulation studies (Chen et al., 2006).",

Also, the virtual screening tools employ scoring functions to predict the strength of the protein-ligand interactions, generating a score for each docked pose. Subsequently, the docked poses are ranked based on the score provided by the scoring function to identify the pose that most closely resembles the actual binding mode of the ligand (Gimeno et al., 2019). PyRx was used for the virtual screening of antiviral drugs against 3CLpro and 2\u2032-OMTase proteins. One hundred twenty-three compounds belonging to the category of antiviral drugs were downloaded from DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2018) and were subsequently converted into a single SDF library. This in-house SDF library was used to screen both the proteins. Two drugs were selected against each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (\u0394G), binding site orientation and the protein residues with which they were found to be interacting with drug molecules. In the case of 3CLpro (see Table 1), we chose two molecules, namely Paritaprevir (DB09297) and Raltegravir (DB06817). Similarly, for 2\u2032-OMTase (see Table 2), the best two drugs were found to be Dolutegravir (DB08930) and Bictegravir (DB11799).",

The core MTase domain is found to comprise residues 30\u2013209 of nsp16 as found in SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 2011). 2\u2032-OMTase catalyses the transfer of SAM methyl group by relying on a conserved K-D-K-E tetrad within the substrate-binding pocket for activity (Menachery et al., 2014). The surface provided by K-D-K-E (Lys-46, Asp-130, Lys-170 and Glu-203) motif present at the bottom of the central groove might bind the first adenine nucleotide conserved as the acceptor of methyl group during methylation (Chen et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The current study aimed to screen pre-existing antiviral drugs and come up with potential antidotes against SARS-CoV-2. The advantages of drug repurposing (also known as drug repositioning, drug reprofiling and drug retasking) include: the risk of the drug failing the safety and toxicity tests is much reduced, reduced costs during clinical trials and finally, significantly reduced time scale required for drug development (Pushpakom et al., 2019). Developing novel drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will demand a lot of time, which we cannot afford at present. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading at a rapid rate; therefore, it is rational to look for pre-existing drugs and formulations, which can control this highly contagious virus. The precautionary steps taken by governments all over the world include social distancing, quarantines and lockdowns, which themselves have adverse psychological and economic repercussions (Madhav et al., 2017). The WHO also recognises the vast potential of drug repurposing approach, and on 18 March 2020, they announced \u2018SOLIDARITY\u2019 (World Health Organization, 2020d) global mega trial of the four most promising COVID-19 treatments. In the present study, we have identified two drugs against 3CLpro (Raltegravir and Paritaprevir) and two drugs against 2\u2032-OMTase (Bictegravir and Dolutegravir), which are supposed to act as potential inhibitors against COVID-19. The proposed drug candidates obtained from this computational study could be efficacious in developing a much-needed threauptics against SARS-CoV-2, and it will further strengthen the concept of drug repurposing. However, being not able to replicate the physiological conditions entirely is one of the main drawbacks of computational biology (Gimeno et al., 2019; Marklund & Benesch, 2019) and therefore, further in vivo/in vitro validations are required to confirm the findings of this study. Raltegravir (Markowitz et al., 2007), Bictegravir (Sax et al., 2017) and Dolutegravir (Cahn et al., 2013; Walmsley et al., 2013) belong to the family of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI). They are already being used in antiretroviral therapy (ART) against the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) infections. The final drug, Paritaprevir(Feld et al., 2016; Sulkowski et al., 2015), is being used to treat chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections. It suppresses viral replication by inhibiting the non-structural 3/4 A protease of HCV (Carrion et al., 2014). Finally, the findings of this study might help develop antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, expediting medical countermeasure advancement and should serve to persuade researchers and physicians to strengthen their efforts on discovering novel uses for existing medications.",
