An example of this is the acquired, or adaptive, immune system (AIS), which is composed of both humoral and cell-mediated components. Here we report the step-by-step construction of a prototype mimic of the AIS that we call an adaptive immune response simulator (AIRS). DNA and enzymes are used as simple artificial analogues of the components of the AIS to create a system that responds to specific molecular stimuli in vitro. We show that this network of reactions can function in a manner that is superficially similar to the most basic responses of the vertebrate AIS, including reaction sequences that mimic both humoral and cellular responses. As such, AIRS provides guidelines for the design and engineering of artificial reaction networks and molecular devices.",

            "text": "A ll organisms, including plants, have developed mechanisms of defence against pathogenic and other challenges, and thus solve a key biological problem: survival. A stunning example of this in humans is the development of learned, or adaptive, immunity, which is composed of both humoral and cellmediated components. Adaptive immunity involves the production of antibodies and immunological memory, but also cell-mediated responses, including the key steps of antigen presentation, antigen binding, co-stimulation and destruction of the foreign body (phagocytosis). More broadly, specialized cells, tissues and organs combine together as a network to recognize, respond and remember specific antigens or pathogens. Functionally, each step in the sequence of humoral and cellular immune response involves the activation and deployment of B and T lymphocytes via highly complex signalling pathways. A fully implemented artificial adaptive immune system (AIS) has not been well studied, possibly as a result of the difficulty in controlling programmability and transferring the high-level biological codes into simple artificial modules and physical implementations. In addition, the formation of robust molecular structures and the precise control of their temporal dynamics may pose other difficulties. However, in the present work, we hypothesize the feasibility of designing a network of reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate AIS, using DNA and enzymes as simplified artificial analogues to mimic the activation and deployment of an adaptive immune response at its most fundamental level.",

As a carrier of genetic information with well-regulated and predictable structures, DNA offers an excellent platform for the design of reaction networks with arbitrary topologies and high programmability 2, 3 . Building on the richness of DNA computing 4, 5 and DNA-enzyme manipulation 6, 7 , synthetic DNA-based systems have been used to explore the possibilities of mimicking both simple and complex systems. For example, small-scale in vitro circuits that encode elementary functions, such as cascades 8 , bistable memory 9,10 or oscillations 11 , have been engineered successfully. In addition, larger networks, including those that mimic neural networks 12 or predator-prey ecosystems 13, 14 , confirm the value of DNA chemistry for implementing the type of system proposed in this study.",

To address both questions, in a stepwise manner we report the construction of a chemical reaction network, AIRS, that couples DNA-enzyme cascade interactions, as described above, with DNA-strand-displacement cascades in which a new product can be activated by the presence of specific initiators 15, 16 , and thus allows many such reactions to be linked into a cascade and even to form a complex network, in particular one such as adaptive immunity in which biological events follow each other sequentially in a rolling fashion.",

Once a foreign target has crossed the threshold of immune tolerance, the humoral and cellular components of the vertebrate immune system are called to action. A key function is antigen presentation, which provides the mechanism for recognition and response. B cells secrete antibodies, which bind to and tag an antigen, whereas T cells perform the job of attacking target cells. Both T and B cells also have roles in forming memory cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , we divided this series of events into three steps (recognition and tolerance, immune response, and killing and memory) under the control of four functional DNA components, including the DNA duplexes AM (antigen-presenting cell (APC) mimicry), BM (B-cell mimicry), PG (primer generator, which generates primers for the analogue antibody) and single-stranded circular DNA CT (circular template, which controls the sequence of the analogue 2* 3* 4* 5* ",

To accomplish this, three infectious states were assumed: original pathogen strand P 0 and the displacement reaction products (with AM and BM) P 1 and P 2 . Together, these all contain an infectious pathogen domain (P). Then, to form the antibody-antigen complex in the system, the P domain in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 hybridizes with a large amount of P* and forms stable duplex regions PP*. However, although the vertebrate host immune system uses phagocytosis as a key strategy in removing pathogens, we designed a purely biomechanical method to mimic the activation of the humoral immune response, that is the binding between the generated P* and the P domain from the pathogen, followed by a restriction enzyme-based step that mimics cell-mediated killing by specifically cutting the 'antibody-antigen' duplex. More specifically, this latter step is accomplished when the hybridization of the P domain with P* creates an active recognition site for the restriction enzyme SspI, which is extracted from an E. coli strain that carries the cloned and modified (Y98F) sspi gene from the restriction site of Sphaerotilus species. In this way, the P domain in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 can be specifically cut into two fragments with the nucleotide numbers 56 and 15 (ref. 19 ), thus losing infectivity.",

These memory cells will trigger a much faster immune response on subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. Therefore, to create a mechanism to mimic the memory function of B cells, we turned to ssDNA TM, which is produced by the displacement reaction between P 0 and AM and remains in the system from the first exposure to P 0 . We also describe its catalysis of P 0 and BM displacement to release primer quickly, and thus trigger a faster RCA reaction that creates antibody for the next exposure to the same pathogen sequence. This reaction is defined as entropy driven because it is one that spontaneously evolves towards thermodynamic equilibrium ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ) 18 . Without TM, the displacement rate between P 0 and BM would be slowed by the effective blocking of active domains on BM. However, in the presence of TM, BM can hybridize with TM through its 4 nt toehold (domain 5*) and then release the ssDNA primer initiator (PI) and the side product W 1 , which results in a new toehold binding region (domain 3*) for the hybridization between P 0 and BM, which is driven forwards thermodynamically by the entropic gain of the liberated molecules. Thus, the effect of memory is produced by speeding up the reaction rate between P 0 and BM using the catalytic effect of the remaining TM produced by the initial recognition. Thus, by leaving TM as a 'catalytic fuel' in the system, a memory effect for a specific pathogen input is achieved.",

To examine the precision of the threshold function of AM, we used a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method to study the hybridization order of P 0 with AM and BM. A fluorophore (fluorescein (FAM)) and quencher (DABCYL (DAB)) pair was coupled in the PG duplex to indicate the released amount of primer for the RCA reaction. Fluorescence restoration only occurs if the threshold level of AM is exceeded, after which the reaction proceeds to step 2, immune response, based on strand-displacement reactions that can release the quencher-labelled primer strand. Therefore, in the presence of 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM fluorophore/quencher-labelled PG, different concentrations of P 0 (from 0 to 150 nM) were introduced to the system with fluorescence monitoring at 517 nm. As shown in Fig. 2b , the fluorescence restoration exhibited a sharp upturn at the P 0 concentration of 80 nM, but little increase below 80 nM, which indicates that the reaction between P 0 and BM had begun at the depletion point of AM. In other words, the threshold value of AM to P 0 is adjustable by changing the concentration of AM. In this case, the depletion point, or threshold level, of AM was reached at 80 nM, indicating that the reaction between P 0 and BM could initiate step 2, which, in humans, is the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes. To confirm this result further, the fluorescence kinetics of the above system was monitored. Initially, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM PG were mixed in the buffer, and a small amount of P 0 (30 nM) was added. As a result of the excess amount of AM and its reaction priority to P 0 by the requirements of step 1, slow fluorescence restoration kinetics occurred. However, when more P 0 (30 nM each time) was added continuously to the system, a sharp increase (after 90 nM in total) was seen in the fluorescence kinetics, which indicates that the reaction could proceed to step 2. Different threshold values were tested by changing the concentrations of AM and BM (Supplementary Fig. 1) . Gel electrophoresis was also used to indicate the order of reactions ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). As the same recognition domain (2-3-4) is shared, similar experimental results were also observed by substituting P 0 for another pathogen sequence, P 0 -SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomic DNA) (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). All the assays confirmed the effective threshold function of AM relative to the reaction between BM and P 0 , and thus provided a macroscopic mimicry of the 'recognition and tolerance' state of AIS.",

Therefore, to prove the catalytic effect of TM, we continued to use our FRET-based reporting model, as described above. Accordingly, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labelled PG were incubated in buffer. Afterwards, 150 nM P 0 were added to the system. We used an excess amount of P 0 to AM to overcome the threshold value. TM is generated in step 1 as a result of the reaction between P 0 and AM. Thus, P 0 , when it exceeds the threshold (as set by controlling the concentration of AM), in turn results in a catalytic reaction between excess P 0 and TM by entropy that can quickly restore the fluorescence of the system. As a comparison, the same concentration of P 0 was added directly to a solution with 100 nM BM and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labelled PG, but no AM. As shown in Fig. 2d , measurements of the fluorescence kinetics of the catalysed reaction exhibited an over 500-fold acceleration in contrast to that without catalysis 18, 20 . Thus, as explained above, the released TM could serve as specific memory mimicry, which results in a stronger and faster immune response for the next exposure to the same pathogen. Afterwards, we also confirmed that the quantity of P* generated from enzymatic amplification for hybridization with domain P in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 could be determined by the amount of primer, thus making the enzymatic reaction controllable by upstream reactions in steps 1 and 2 (see the Supplementary  Information ). In addition, the restriction-enzyme-based digestion of the generated antigen-antibody complex was studied and is shown in the Supplementary Information.",

After confirming the proper function of each step, we further tested the performance of the entire system with the same pathogen strand input from the B. anthracis genome (P 0 ). To confirm the tolerance of AIRS, a small amount of P 0 (100 nM) was then added to the system, and fluorescence was monitored in real time. Next, we designed a DNA molecular beacon (MB-R) to report the amount of RCA product fluorescently by using the pathogen B. anthracis genomic sequence P as its loop. MB-R could be opened by the RCA products, that is P*, and thereby exhibit fluorescence restoration that represents different amounts of P*. Figure 3a shows that the fluorescence kinetics is similar to that without P 0 , which confirms that the system is not activated to produce P* when the amount of pathogen is below the level of immune tolerance (that is, a threshold of 200 nM). However, when another 150 nM P 0 was added to the system to mimic a second exposure to the same pathogen, the fluorescence restoration showed a much faster kinetics behaviour, which indicates the production of a large amount of P* and a successful triggering of the immune response. In addition, the faster response during the second exposure also confirms the memory effect of this system for a specific pathogen. If P 0 -SARS is used as a pathogen input and a molecular beacon encoded with P 0 -SARS (MB-R-SARS) is used as the reporter, similar fluorescence-response trends are seen, as shown in Fig. 3b , which indicates that AIRS potentially works for a second pathogen input. We also used a different fluorescence-reporting system to indicate the amount of generated P*, which is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10 . Using a fluorescence reporter in independent experiments, AIRS was demonstrated to operate equally well with two different pathogen inputs. Therefore, we next studied if it could also work when two different inputs were presented simultaneously. To make this determination, P 0 and P 0 -SARS were introduced together to a solution that contained all the components (300 nM AM, 300 nM BM, 300 nM PG, 50 nM CT-P 0 , 50 nM CT-P-SARS, 0.5 U \u03bcl -1 Phi29 and 250 \u03bcM dNTP). As in the experiment above, two different molecular beacons with the same fluorophore and quencher (MB-R and MB-R-SARS) were also added to the mixture to report the amounts of both RCA products fluorescently, that is P* and P*-SARS. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 14 , as long as both pathogen inputs are below the level of immune tolerance (threshold of 300 nM), AIRS is not activated and fluorescence remains unchanged compared with the background signal. However, when the concentrations increase to a level higher than the threshold for either one, or both, pathogens, fluorescence is restored, which indicates that both pathogen inputs can generate corresponding antibody mimicry when they are mixed together. This confirms that AIRS has the capacity to respond simultaneously to two different pathogen inputs.",

Interestingly, if P 0 is substituted by a double-nucleotide polymorphism input (P 0 -mis), antibody mimicry P* can still be generated with an excess concentration of P 0 -mis. However, the hybridization between P 0 -mis and P* cannot be digested by the SspI restriction enzyme, which demonstrates that the AIRS system is sensitive to the recognition of nucleotide polymorphism of the pathogen input ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). AIRS has been designed with two layers of selectivity, which makes it possible for the system to differentiate P 0 from a double-nucleotide polymorphism input, P 0 -mis.",

            "text": "To explain, the relatively weaker binding ability between P 0 -mis and P* when compared to that between P 0 and P* makes the P 0 -mis-P* duplex less stable. Additionally, a P 0 -mis-P* mismatch duplex cannot form an effective recognition binding site with the restriction enzyme SspI (AAT-ATT), and thereby reduce the enzyme's digestion rate, which, in turn, results in much less cleavage product from the input P 0 -mis ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). In contrast, because the hybridization of P 0 -SARS with P* creates a recognition binding site identical to that of the restriction enzyme SspI, similar gel electrophoresis results were found (Fig. 4c) , which again confirms that AIRS can work for different pathogen inputs. Finally, as noted above, the specificity of the system mainly depends on the restriction enzyme and sequence of CT (see the Supplementary Information). When we challenged the system by introducing FAM-labelled P 0 -SARS as the pathogenic input, but CT for B. anthracis as the amplification template, no obvious fluorescent band of high molecular weight appeared with either small or large amounts of P 0 -SARS under the FITC channel because of the lack of hybridization between P 0 -SARS and P* specifically generated for B. anthracis ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ).",

Accordingly, the designed artificial AIRS was, de novo, demonstrated to mimic superficially three basic steps of the host immune response, namely recognition and tolerance, immune response, and killing and memory, but without the presence any living component to achieve functionality. Moreover, even though the designed system is entirely synthetic, biocompatibility was shown by its ability to use only biological molecules (DNA and enzyme). Consequently, as the cellular state can be controlled by DNA or RNA, it could be possible to encode cellular functions to the system output (that is, the DNA and/or RNA strand) 5,21-26 , which makes it possible to scale up this prototype to increasingly intelligent molecular nanocontrollers and nano-operators. However, to achieve this, our current construction design will need to be improved and integrated with other chemistries.",
