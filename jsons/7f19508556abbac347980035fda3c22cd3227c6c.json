Initial CT, obtained 14 days after the onset of the symptoms (Fig. 1A) , demonstrated multifocal groundglass opacities with or without superimposed reticulation and mild fibrotic change at bilateral lungs, including peripheral subpleural regions of both lobes; however, the majority of the lesions had resolved in the followed-up CT after 4 weeks (Fig. 1B) , including the previously thought fibrotic changes suggesting reversibility rather than scaring. 4 The CT finding fits into the time frame of the absorptive stage as described by Pan et al. The pathophysiology of this emerging has been proposed to be similar to that of the SARS virus because of its highly homologous genome. 3 Patients with such either disease may develop ARDS, and subsequently pulmonary fibrosis. Because our patient never developed ARDS during her hospital stay, we believe that the earlier thought to be fibrotic changes found in CT may be due to injury to the alveolar epithelial cells because of an inflammatory process, but was not severe enough to cause scarring. Despite the findings on the initial CT, our patient made an almost full recovery without antifibrotic agents and antiviral agents.",
