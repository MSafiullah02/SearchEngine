These progenitor cells can represent an intermediate stage between stem cells and fully differentiated ones. Unlike stem cells they cannot usually self-renew, and they typically differentiate into more mature cells soon after they are produced [2] .",

As mentioned previously, hematopoietic stem cells are continuously replicating and differentiating due to the high turnover rate of blood cells. Stem cells in the lungs, liver, hair follicles, and gastrointestinal tract also do this to replace cells within them having short life cycles [5] On the other hand, stem cells in organs and tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscles, pancreas, and nervous system are predominantly dormant. They form new, mature cells of only a specific type, and at a very slow pace that may increase due to an acute need such as damage to those mature cells. In some cases their rate of turnover is so slow that, in the case of the heart and nervous tissue, it was thought until recently that those organs had no ability to create new mature cells following birth. This is in contrast to early (e.g. embryonic) stages when stem cells divide and proliferate rapidly to ultimately produce all the differentiated cells that develop during the active growth process [21] .",

The hope is that at least some of these other methods will be safer regarding the risk of developing cancer. Methods that do not result in integration of new genetic material into the cell's DNA are considered safer than ones that do. However, it is still possible that they too might produce enough genetic and epigenetic changes to make the resulting iPSCs more susceptible to creating tumors rather than healthy differentiated cells. Moreover, most non-integrating methods are significantly less efficient at producing iP-SCs than the original ones using retroviruses, although newer techniques may improve this [53] . In fact, recent reports indicate that a non-viral technique that modifies a single genetic factor could produce iPSCs with nearly 100 % efficiency [73, 74] .",

However, the latter can also potentially increase the odds of developing serious infections and cancer by itself.

This usually works best when the donors and recipient are close family members, who typically share more of the same antigens with each other than with non-related individuals. The degree of antigen \"matching\" is related to how close the family relationship is, with that in monozygotic 3 A particular individual's red blood cells may have both the A and B antigens (type AB); only the A antigen, with antibodies against the B antigen in the bloodstream (type A); only the B antigen, with antibodies against the A antigen in the bloodstream (type B); or neither the A nor the B antigen, and antibodies against both the A and B antigens in the bloodstream (type O). An immune response that destroys red blood cells will occur if a person receives a blood type containing an antigen he or she does not have. Thus, an individual with type AB blood can receive any other type of blood; type A can only receive type A or O; type B can only receive type B or O; and type O can only receive type O. There should also be compatibility regarding another red blood cell antigen, the \"Rh factor.\" Thus, a person with \"O+\" blood is type O and has the Rh factor, while one who is \"O-\" is type O but lacks the Rh factor and can have antibodies against it. Thus, an O + individual can safely receive blood from an O + or O-donor, while someone with O-blood can only receive it from another O-individual. twins obviously being the closest. Depending on which antigens were inherited from each parent, siblings may or may not be close matches, a particular parent may share some but not all antigens with a child, and overall similarities decrease as relatives become more distant.",

In the latter works the mismatch between supply and demand for organs is \"solved\" by either punishing individuals found guilty (with reduced regard for whether they are actually innocent instead) of what would now be considered trivial \"crimes\" with the death penalty, or by simply stealing them from victims (\"organlegging\"). However, the key practical problem with a society in which everyone (or at least the majority of the population) is at significant risk of being an involuntary donor/victim or recipient is that the net benefit/risk may be comparable for everyone, reducing if not eliminating the value of implementing of such an organ procurement system. 5 Also, simply following current standard medical procedures for organ tracking (e.g. it is not standard operating procedure to purchase organs via online auctions or other poorly documented sources) and ethical guidelines should curb (but unfortunately, given enough individuals lacking such ethical principles, certainly not entirely eliminate) widespread use of the organlegging technique. 6 Besides informed consent for the procedure, organ transplantation for \"vital\" organs such as the heart requires that the patient be \"brain dead.\" This can be defined as the \"complete and irreversible cessation of all brain and brainstem function [100] \". Using this as the \"standard\" for death replaces earlier concepts that death occurred when the heart stopped beating and breathing ceased. Current medical treatments include cardiac defibrillators, pacemakers, and medications that can restore what would otherwise be a fatal arrhythmia. These and other methods such as mechanical ventilators can support a person's cardiopulmonary system well enough to keep the rest of the body's remaining organs functioning even when brain death has occurred. An all too common scenario is that of a young adult who has suffered severe head trauma or another cause of isolated brain/brainstem injury that left the rest of the body reasonably intact and functional. 7 A variety of guidelines have been developed to make the diagnosis of brain death [101] . Key points include ascertaining that no reversible reasons for loss of brain activity are present (e.g. medications or hypothermia-see Chap. 7), the presence of multiple specific findings on a neurological examination (including but not limited to criteria for coma and absence of many types of reflexes), and performance of tests designed to assess brain activity and/or blood flow. The challenge is to ensure that the best possible criteria for evaluating and confirming brain death, with complete and irreversible loss of brain and brainstem function, are used and applied properly. In particular, brain death must be distinguished from other diagnoses such as a persistent vegetative state (a condition associated with severe brain damage and reduced consciousness) that have at least the potential to improve. Given the critical ethical principle of not removing vital organs from an individual who is not truly brain dead, it is essential that current standards for that diagnosis continue to be discussed and refined as needed based on further reviews and findings. 8 Another method to increase the supply of donor organs is to use ones from animals-\"xenotransplantation.\" As noted previously, some early attempts at organ transplantation involved taking them from goats, pigs, etc. Many organs in pigs are similar to size to those of humans, and they can be obtained in great abundance. In fact, specially treated heart valves derived from pigs or from the pericardium (the thin sac of tissue enclosing the heart) of bovines are used to create certain kinds of artificial heart valves for humans.",

In short, this method to procure organs for transplantation is, besides being grossly unethical, tremendously complex and costly for the proposed \"return on investment.\" Fortunately considerably \"simpler\" methods are being investigated for creating new organs (and certain tissues) for transplantation. 3D printing techniques may be applied to create an inorganic structure in an appropriate shape (scaffold), such as to replace part of a bone in a person's body [102] . Osteoblasts and other bone cells could then be introduced to the scaffold where they could proliferate and help form part of a new bone. After implantation of this bone-like structure into a person's body, that individual's own cells could also be stimulated by its presence to promote further growth and healing. Similar concepts underlie methods used to create other artificial structures such as outer ears (auricles) [103, 104] .",

The first \"heterotopic\"heart transplant was done in 1974 by Dr. Christian Barnard, who performed the first \"orthotopic\" operation to replace one human heart with another in 1967. In a heterotopic operation a person's original, damaged heart is left in place and a new, donor heart is implanted into the right side of the chest. This procedure can involve connecting the new heart to the old one in such a way that it either assists only the left side of the original heart or both the right and left sided sets of chambers (see Chap. 1).",

These can include significantly increased pressures in the pulmonary (lung) blood vessels; if the available donor heart is considered marginal for being able to take over a person's entire circulation; or if it is not an ideal match to the recipient regarding HLA or other antigen typing and thus has an increased risk of rejection. An obvious advantage is that, if the donor heart is rejected, the patient still has the original heart present. A disadvantage is that the second heart can develop its own problems such as potentially serious arrhythmias and blood clots forming inside it. However, in selected patients it can be a lifesaving treatment [111] .",

The pace at which particular issues will be addressed-what types of stem cells will prove most useful and safe for tissue/organ repair or replacement, dealing with the complex immunological problems with transplantation, growing whole new organs-is uncertain. It is also unclear what the theoretical and practical limits of various avenues of research might be, such as whether the risks of using stem cells might (at least in some circumstances) outweigh their benefits or if complex organs such as the heart (much less the brain!) can actually be created at a level of function and safety as well as in numbers suitable for extensive clinical use. Science fiction, unfettered by many real-world considerations of the scientific difficulties involved, can use ideas involving regenerative medicine and organ transplantation in many ways and settings. However, extending them too far for story purposes can reduce the work's realism regarding other considerations, as mentioned previously regarding Parts: The Clonus Horror. If such techniques do become feasible, all of their ramifications-including how practical they are to perform, how much they cost, how long it takes to perform them, what resources are needed to use them, etc.-should be taken into account if only implicitly.",

While such methods can certainly help an individual (e.g. one requiring a heart transplant) live longer than would otherwise be possible, they might have at most little impact on extending maximal lifespan beyond the known (at least so far) upper limit of about 122 years. As noted in Chap. 9, aging is a process that involves the whole body and is in a fundamental sense different from \"disease.\" While it certainly may act as a stopgap measure to prolong life, replacing a liver or kidney will do nothing to restore an elderly individual's immune system, clear that person's cells of accumulated DNA mutation and damage, prevent degeneration of the brain, etc. Other methods will have to be developed (if they can be) to address such issues. The net result is that many, many \"medical miracles\" will likely need to be developed (once again, if they actually can) in many, many different and distinct areas (genetic engineering, nanotechnology, use of stems cells and organ transplantation, etc.) to create a biologically youthful 200-year old human with intact cerebral function.",

How the synthetic skin would allow something as simple but essential as sweating is not addressed. Likewise, burns sufficient to \"require\" replacing a person's entire skin would also presumably involve at least some fourth-degree burns to underlying tissues, including the most vulnerable ones such as those of the penis and scrotum. Likewise the eyelids would offer little protection to the eyes in that situation, but there is no description of the latter being \"boiled.\"",
