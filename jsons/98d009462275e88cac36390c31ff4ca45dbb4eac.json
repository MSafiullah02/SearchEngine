Diastolic blood pressure augmentation increases the intrinsic windkessel effect leading to storage of extra potential energy in the aorta and conversion to kinetic energy following the elastic recoil of the vessel [3] . This event has the potential to increase coronary blood flow. Rapid deflation of the balloon in early systole leads to afterload reduction or, to be more precise, to reduction of impedance to ventricular ejection and cardiac work [4] , [5] . This is in accordance with a previous analytical model [5] .

The first abdominal tract behavior is reproduced by RLC elements (RABT1, LABT1 and CABT1) when the IABP is disabled.
