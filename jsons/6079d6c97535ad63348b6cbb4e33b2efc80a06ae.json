Of 51 the immunoassays currently available, choice of SARS-CoV-2 target antigens include 52 the spike protein (S) or the nucelocapsid (N) (2). IgA antibodies can show higher 53 sensitivity, while IgG antibodies typically have longer duration, better specificity, and are 54 better suited for serosurveillance studies (3contains microplate strips with 8 break-off reagent wells coated with recombinant 62 structural protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the first reaction step, diluted patient samples are 63 incubated in the wells. In the case of positive samples, specific antibodies will bind to the 64 antigens. To detect the bound antibodies, a second incubation is carried out using an 65 enzyme-labelled antihuman IgA or IgG (enzyme conjugate) catalyzing a color reaction. 66 Results are evaluated semi-quantitatively by calculation of a ratio of the extinction of the 67 control or patient sample over the extinction of the calibrator. This ratio is interpreted of Chicago Medicine uses 2 different RT-PCR assays allowed by the 76 FDA under Emergency Use Authorization. The Roche cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay 77 relies on amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 specific ORF1 gene as well as a portion of 78 the E-gene conserved across the sarbecoviruses, serum and plasma samples submitted to the University of Chicago 90 Medicine Clinical Laboratories for routine testing were recovered for this evaluation. 91 Percent agreement was determined and the hybrid Wilson/Brown method was used to 92 calculate 95% confidence intervals of proportions (95% CI). All statistical analyses -seven samples were tested from patients thought to be negative for exposure to 97 SARS-CoV-2. Forty-one of the samples were from ambulatory patients at the University of Chicago with negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. The remaining 16 samples 99 were collected in early 2019, prior to the current pandemic, and stored atthat was positive for IgG was also positive for IgA. Chart review revealed 110 an episode 4 weeks prior of a fever of 103.5\u00b0F and diarrhea, without cough. This 111 clinical picture that could be consistent with COVID-19 disease. This positive 112 serological result and negative PCR could represent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with 113 clearance of the virus. 114 Samples from sixty-seven unique specimens from 49 patients with PCR-positive SARS-115 CoV-2 were tested. Of these samples, 55 tested positive and 12 tested negative for IgA 116 (82.1% agreement, 95% CI: 71.3-89.4) while 40 tested positive and 27 tested negative 117 for IgG (59.7% agreement, 95% CI: 47.7-70.6). Six borderline positives for IgA and 2 118 borderline positives for IgG were included in the positive results. 119 120 These 67 samples from PCR positive patients were collected 0 to 45 days after PCR 121 testing. The 12 IgA-negative samples and the 27 IgG-negative samples were collected 122 within 7 days of PCR testing. Since antibody development occurs after viremia and 123 requires time to reach a detectable concentration, it is likely that these samples were 124 collected too early in the course of disease to expect antibody production. 125 126 The 67 serological samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients were stratified by 127 the number of days following the positive PCR result. For samples collected \u22653 days 128 after positive PCR, 29 of 30 (96.7%, 95% CI: 83.3-99.8) were positive for IgA (see chart 129 1); all 21 samples collected after one week were IgA positive. For samples collected \u22654 130 days after positive PCR, 28 of 28 (100%, 95% CI: 87.9-100) were positive for IgG (",
