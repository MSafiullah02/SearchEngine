There are clear areas for improvement\u2014for example, activity inference can be unreliable and drains battery life, and Google Flu is still poor at detecting atypical flu trends, as the most severe often are [5].

For example, during an 8-week Internet-mediated physical activity program at the University of Michigan, participants were more likely to meet weekly physical activity goals if they joined a competitive team than if they participated as individuals [15]. In other studies, sharing physical activity levels, such as step counts, has helped to motivate people to be more active through social support and social pressure. In addition to providing users with individual feedback, the mobile phone application, Houston, facilitated the sharing of step counts and physical activity-related messages among a small group of friends [16]. Participants in the study\u2019s sharing condition were more likely to achieve their daily goals than participants without this feature. The Fish\u2019n\u2019Steps study found that sharing with strangers is not always motivating and is sometimes awkward [17]. Nevertheless, interacting with strangers can have benefits. In a 16-week Internet-mediated walking program, subjects with access to a discussion board had a 13% higher retention rate compared to a group without this feature; however, daily step count was not affected [18,19].",

In some cases, these data can also be used to identify adverse events or poor quality health care (perceived or actual) [20]. These accounts provide both useful information that other patients can use to make decisions, but also provide people with a sense that they are not alone. This can be particularly important in rural areas or for individuals with rare conditions, when there are no physically proximate peers [9]. Peer support can also be enhanced by focusing on connecting a group of people from the same geographic area [21,22] or who share the same health provider [23,24]. When peers share context and constraints, they can offer advice and narratives relevant to the specific health concern and that are more likely to fit into each other\u2019s lives.",

When a protracted illness or other major health event strikes a patient or their family, friends and extended family often want to pitch in to help with day-to-day tasks. Websites such as CaringBridge and CareCalendar can help patients and families solicit and coordinate that help. Many popular fitness applications, including Daily Mile, RunKeeper, Nike+, Adidas miCoach, FitBit, and LoseIt, also connect users to their existing social networks, including friends and family, on sites such as Twitter and Facebook.

They know the individual and can give advice that is relevant to their context, and they may be in a better position to understand what sort of support or pressure an individual would benefit from hearing [8]. For health goals related to one\u2019s identity and impression management (eg, feeling and being perceived as fit), the opportunity to communicate that identity to friends, family, and even former acquaintances can be an important motivator [9]. Through ongoing relationships in other aspects of life, they can offer accountability and social pressure\u2014even, or especially, when someone stops participating in a health intervention [9].",

This particular lens has previously been used to examine issues such as electronic voting, how the public perceives risks associated with information technologies, systems and practices to support decision-making, how construction workers adopt and use mobile communication tools, and how people make decisions about managing privacy and communicating identity using information technology. Using Ackerman\u2019s proposed ways of moving forward on such challenges, we review current work to improve how people can manage their privacy when sharing to support health. We then briefly highlight additional key challenges of the sociotechnical gap in in social media for health. We identify consistent themes across these challenges and suggest ways forward.",

These norms describe both the information that is appropriate for that space and in what ways that information or may or not be reshared, remembered, or further disseminated. Thus, it addresses what an individual discloses, what information is collected about them without their disclosure, and how that information may be used. Privacy violations, then, occur when information is shared or collected that is not appropriate for the given context, or when it is stored or shared (or not stored or shared) in a way that people would not expect for that context. Adams and Sasse propose a model of privacy violations [34] that is largely congruent with Nissenbaum\u2019s definition. In their model, individuals have assumptions about information\u2019s sensitivity, how it will be used, and who will receive it.

First, we must acknowledge that perfect privacy and sharing is not going to happen. It is the classic example of a sociotechnical gap. Our technological systems cannot fully support users\u2019 desires [6]. Finer-grained privacy and sharing controls make for greater configuration challenges; even users confident that they understand controls can make sharing errors in such systems [10]. On the other hand, automated- (or administrator-) configured sharing raises the risk for the technology to introduce mistakes. As Nissenbaum notes, privacy is one of the \u201cenduring social issues associated with information technologies\u201d [33]. With health information, the sharing and privacy needs may be more complex, and the stakes higher, compared to many other types of information. Privacy challenges will endure when trying to use social media to support health goals.",

Such approaches are alive and well among HCI and CSCW researchers working on social media for health (eg, [8,67,68]). This is heartening. These approaches can surface and make salient the relevant norms of a space or of the stakeholders as part of the design process. They enable the design of systems that are more responsive to the people and organizations they affect, and with greater awareness of the trade-offs inherent in any system.

Many study participants were excited, hoping that this would help them get valuable support and accountability from their social networks.

Here, a barrier is the gap between individuals\u2019 mental models of how the Facebook feed works (all friends see all of your posts) and how it actually works (some friends may see each post). This misunderstanding can cause them to perceive a lack of comments or likes as being ignored by friends in a time of need rather than a result of their posts just not being seen.

This transition from antonym to a distinct state of health may have occurred in large part as a result of the Peckham experiment in 20th century England [81].

From these two seeds, \u201cactive lifestyle \u2026 enjoyment with neighbors\u201d and \u201crisk factors\u201d, the current pervasive wellness movement was born [83]. While the Peckham group focused on families and the healthy development of children, the wellness movement has been more directed to the individual, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle choices that can lead either to illness or good health. In the 1970s, wellness took on many aspects of a quasi-religious movement. For some, it was sufficient to practice a seemingly evidence-based regimen of hygiene, non-smoking, exercise, low animal fat diet, and moderate or no alcohol intake. For others, wellness required adherence to spiritual exercises and/or to strict dietary regimens. We now know that while individual choices do influence health, environmental determinants including social connectedness and satisfying family life are of at least equal importance. More recently, we have come to recognize not only that living in close connection with nature is health-enhancing, but also that many aspects of our current \u201cbuilt environment\u201d have strong adverse effects on our health [84,85].",

While some exposure to alternative definitions of wellness, through online social interactions, may be beneficial, large differences in definitions of health may make it hard to reach target populations. Overly strong social rewards (eg, status) or sanctions (eg, stigmatization) may be coercive. Designing a technology-mediated social space that will always offer the optimal support and accountability for appropriate health and wellness goals is unreasonable, though designers of health systems should be sensitive to this issue.",

Though Fit4Life includes some technologies that do not yet exist, the overall system and capabilities are not large leaps beyond products currently on the market.
