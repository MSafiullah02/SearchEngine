            "text": "Dengue fever is an important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. This has been a recurrent phenomenon throughout the tropics in the past decade. During 2002, more than 30 Latin American countries reported over a million dengue fever (DF)\n1 cases with large number of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Annually, there are an estimated 100 million dengue virus infections worldwide [1]. Increasingly cases of the more severe and potentially lethal DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are reported with children bearing much of the disease burden. Dengue virus is endemic in at least 100 countries worldwide and causes more human cases than any other mosquito-borne virus. The mortality rate of DHF in most countries is 5%, primarily among children and young adults. In several Asian countries, this virus is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children. Hence, there is an urgent need for diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic reagents to manage DHF.",

All non-structural proteins are intracellular proteins with the exception of dengue NS1 protein, which exists as secreted as well as a membrane-associated protein. Both forms are demonstrated to be immunogenic [2], [3], [4]. It was also reported that NS1 is one of 7 NS proteins produced during viral replication. It possesses not only group specific but also type specific determinants and has been recognized as an important antigen in dengue infection [2], [4], [5]. A high circulating level of NS1 was demonstrated in the acute phase of dengue by antigen capture ELISAs [2], [6]. The precise function of dengue NS1 protein remains unclear. However, antigen detection of non-structural dengue antigens may be of benefit for an early stage rapid diagnosis of infection due to its long half life in the blood.",

Renaturing conditions, protein concentrations in the refolding buffer as well as suitable buffer compositions are important to simulate correct folding, formation of the proper disulfide bond and proper association of different domains. It has been reported that the presence of arginine in refolding buffer played an important role in solubilization, inhibiting the aggregation of refolding intermediates and thus increases the yield of the refolded protein [14]. It has also been clearly demonstrated in the literature that addition of GSH/GSSG into the refolding buffer facilitates disulfide bond formation and thus enhances renaturation of the protein [15]. The refolding step was done for 3 days by dialysis and any aggregate formed during refolding was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was collected as refolded rNS1 for further use. Thus the in vitro refolding proved to be successful in recovering soluble protein expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. The purification steps and yield of rNS1 protein from 1 L of E. coli culture are summarized in Table 2\n. The purity of the refolded rNS1 protein was evident from the SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 4B) and Western blot (Fig. 4C) with a single band of approximate molecular weight of 46 kDa.

Bacterial expression is perhaps the most commonly employed expression system for the production of non-glycosylated recombinant proteins. The organism is relatively simple to manipulate and the small scale analysis of many different parameters can be optimized in a short period of time. This allows the rapid identification and optimization of several growth and induction conditions for medium scale production. Many eukaryotic genes cannot be expressed efficiently in the E. coli host due to the difference in codon preference as well as toxicity of foreign protein and mRNA instability for the expression of protein encoded by the gene. It is also a very well known fact that heterologously expressed eukaryotic proteins are not post-translationally modified when it is expressed in E. coli. It is also difficult to express as soluble protein or facilitate the secretion of expressed protein into the culture medium. In addition, proteins expressed in large amounts tend to precipitate, forming inclusion bodies [10], [30], [31] and present an advantage with respect to higher yield and especially the purification of expressed protein.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated in the literature that genes can be codon optimized to the host translational system with the significantly higher expression level than native genes [7]. Based on this knowledge, we have obtained the codon optimized NS1 gene from GENEART Inc. for expression in E. coli. In the present study, we have cloned and purified the dengue NS1 protein in E. coli for the development of monoclonal antibody and subsequently bispecific antibodies for early diagnostic applications. NS1 gene was cloned under the control of the pBAD promoter for high-level expression of recombinant protein as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytoplasm. The final yield of purified inclusion bodies was estimated by Bradford protein assay [11] to be approximately 230\u2013250 mg/L of initial bacterial culture which is 10- to 25-fold higher compared to previous reports using the native NS1 gene sequence. We have expressed several viral antigens in E. coli exploiting codon optimized genes and the NS1 expression is the most robust yield we have achieved (Table 3\n). The bacterial cell lysis by French Press and washing steps with detergent were used successfully to purify inclusion bodies from soluble protein. SDS\u2013PAGE analysis clearly demonstrated that lysis by French Press and several washings with lysis buffer increased the purity of the inclusion bodies since the bulk of the E. coli soluble proteins were separated. The purity of inclusion bodies was also judged by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blot (data not shown). The purification method exploits the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) under denaturing conditions. The effectively adsorbed His-tagged protein could be purified to homogeneity [10]. IMAC purification under denaturing conditions yielded significant amount of pure rNS1 protein with a single band as judged by SDS\u2013PAGE and with a typical yield of 60\u201380% of starting denatured inclusion bodies (Table 2). Most recombinant proteins are expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and different refolding methods have been reported to renature proteins from inclusion bodies [10], [32]. The IMAC eluted rNS1 protein was refolded in TA buffer in the presence of a redox pair (GSH/GSSG) with three different protein concentrations (Table 4\n). There are 12 cysteines conserved among flaviviruses that form disulfide bond (S\u2013S) which suggesting their role in structure and function of the protein. The crystal structure of NS1 protein is yet not known but Wallis et al. has predicted 6 disulfide bonds present in the dengue NS1 protein [33]. Therefore the addition of GSH/GSSG into the refolding buffer which maintained the oxidizing environment enhances S\u2013S bond formation and hence increases the solubility of the recombinant protein [15], [34]. The protein concentration plays a crucial role in refolding conditions and it was observed that when the concentration was above 100 \u03bcg/ml, aggregation was evident. The purity of the refolded protein was judged by SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 4B) and Western blot (Fig. 4C) data indicated that anti-His6 MAb reacted with a single band of \u223c46 kDa, suggesting that we had successfully purified rNS1. The identity of purified rNS1 protein was confirmed by in vitro gel digestion, mass spectrometry, and NCBI non-redundant database searching. The refolded rNS1 antigen is being used to immunize mice to develop monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antibodies from mouse serum were strongly reacting with recombinant antigen (Fig. 5\nA) in Western blot (Fig. 5B). The rNS1 protein will be useful to select a pair of monoclonal antibodies with non-overlapping different specificities for antigen capture ELISA and point of care rapid assays [35]. In addition, the rNS1 antigen based ELISA could be the basis of developing a sensitive serum diagnostic to monitor dengue outbreaks by detecting the early human anti-dengue antibodies.",
