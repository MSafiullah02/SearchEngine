            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) persistent infections are considered the primary cause of ano-genital cancer, where greater than 99% of cervical cancer and more than 60% of anal cancer contain HPV DNA [1, 2]. Throughout the past years, several studies have suggested the link between HPV infection and other epithelial cancers, including cutaneous and oropharyngeal cancers. Oropharyngeal cancers are often referred to as \u201chead and neck cancer\u201d (HNC), and mainly include squamous-cell carcinoma which occurs in the oral cavity, base of tongue, tonsils, adenoids pharynx and larynx. Recent studies on HPV infection in oral exfoliated cells have shown that there is a 13-fold higher risk for oropharyngeal cancer in the presence of virus [3\u20135]. The highest prevalence (up to 50%) for these HPV associated cancers has been found in the tonsillar cancers sub-set [6\u20138]. Since HPV16 presented a global prevalence in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of 40.6 and 14.9% respectively [9], IARC categorized this genotype as a risk factor with for the pathogenesis of both cancers [10]. Additionally, other HPV types have also been linked with these cancers, including HPV18, 31, and 33 [11] including \u03b2 and \u0263 types [4]. Furthermore, while \u03b1-HPV detection seems to be rare in oral cavity in comparison to anal or cervical districts [12], many novel \u03b2 and \u03b3 types have been isolated in oral cavity [13] suggesting a wide tropism range of these genera [14]. At the same time, different studies on HPV prevalence provided contradicting result for \u03b2 and \u0263 types not only in oropharyngeal site, but also in cervical and anal anatomical sites [14\u201319].",

These primers, both targeting highly conserved region within L1 ORF, are considered broad range PV primers and allow the detection of the great majority of already known and officially recognized HPV types. MY09/11 had been used in \u03b1 HPV detection in cervical sites, where they showed good sensitivity in alpha HPV types amplification [21], while FAP primers officially recognized HPV from \u03b1-PV, \u03b2-PV, and \u0263-PV genera, and might detect potentially new types [22\u201325]. This property is particularly relevant, since \u0263 and \u03b2 papillomaviruses have been already identified in several anatomic sites [14, 26]. Granted that that HPV prevalence is significantly higher among HIV infected people and at multiple anatomic sites [26\u201329] we included both HIV positive and HIV negative people in our study in order to also verify whether \u03b2 and \u0263 HPV positivity is influenced by host immune status.",

            "text": "In HNC, particularly oropharyngeal cancer, the true prevalence and involvement of HPV in the carcinogenetic process is still unknown. In fact, many studies report low prevalence of HPV obtained with systems used for the determination of HPV in cervical cancer screening (specific for \u03b1 types), while other authors found higher prevalence when they used a platform able to detect HPV types belonging to genera other than \u03b1 genus [4] both in oral cavity and in oral cancer [4, 39]. Agalliu recently found a correlation between the infection of some \u03b2, \u0263 HPV types and OSCC [4]. Furthermore, a recent meta- analysis provided additional evidence of the involvement of \u03b2 HPV types in the development of SCC in immunocompetent individuals [40]. Additionally, several mechanistic studies have consistently showed that E6 and E7 from several \u03b2 HPV types are able to target cellular proteins, such as p53 and pRb, and to deregulate fundamental events involved in cellular transformation [41]. Thus \u03b2 and \u0263 HPV types detection could be included in a HPV screening test for oral cancer prevention, while a correct and suitable detection of HPV infection is becoming a priority. Currently, there are few studies that compare the HPV prevalence obtained using the protocols, which are normally for cervical cancer screening with those obtained using methods that are able to detect HPV types belonging to genera other than \u03b1 or new ones. In this study, in order to assess the impact of PCR system in HPV prevalence determination, we carried out the detection of HPV with MY09/11 primer set, used in several genotyping molecular assays (for example Linear Array HPV genotyping Test, Roche Molecular system, CA USA; CLART HPV2 clinical arrays, Genomica, Madrid, Spain,) and FAP primers able to detect \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 HPV types in several specimens. In oropharyngeal swabs samples, MY09/11 primer set was able to detect 39.4% (13/33) of HPV positive samples, while FAP set of primers detected the presence of HPV in 20/33 samples (60.6%). Beta HPV was the main genus detected with a prevalence of 69.7% in HPV positive samples. This prevalence was in agreement with Bottalico et al. that used FAP primer and MY09/11 for detecting HPV in oral swabs [14]. HPV5 was the most frequent \u03b21 type and HPV145 the main type among \u03b22 species as described by Bottalico [14]. HPV38, which was reported as the main \u03b22 type in Forslund study [42], was absent in our samples. HR, namely HPV16, was observed only in one specimen from an HIV positive subject, whereas HR HPV were frequently observed in Bottalico study group [14]. The low frequency of HR could be imputed to immune status of the patients. Our patients were under HAART therapy and most of them had a CD4 T cell count > 200 /\u03bcl. No severe compromise of the immune-system could have limited a persistence of HR in this anatomical site. Unfortunately, no information was given in the Bottalico paper on patient CD4 T cell count, and this fact did not allow a correct comparison of these results. According to previous data reported by Forslund et al. [42], no difference in HPV prevalence was observed among men and women suggesting that host specific factors could contribute to HPV persistence and neoplasia development. Gamma genus represented 21.8% of HPV positive samples. To note, 6/7 \u03b3 strains were untyped. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2 samples (Q1766 and Q1644) belonged to \u03b37 species, while Q656 to \u03b3 12 species and Q337 to \u03b39 species. Interestingly, the oral untyped genotypes fell in different genera and cluster with the anal untyped strains, suggesting a specific tropism of these gamma types for oral mucosa. Gamma 12 and 7 were the most representative \u03b3 species described by Bottalico in oral rinse and Agalliu in HNC, suggesting their potential involvement in OSCC development.",

            "text": "Unlike Forslund and Hampras [42, 43], we did not identified any \u03b23, \u03b24, \u03b25 HPV types. This may be due to the types of biological samples that were used or to differences in the efficiency of extraction methods that were applied, which could have influenced the outcome of PCR [44]. Finally, differences in results might also be explained by the geographical distribution of HPV types. In general, differences in HPV \u03b2 and \u03b3 types and their prevalence were observed by the Luminex platform. According to HIM study [43], among \u03b21 genotypes, HPV12 and HPV5 were the prevalent genotypes. While, among \u03b22 strains, HPV38 was the most represented,and it was never detected in our samples. Interestingly HR HPV38 was also the main \u03b22 type observed also in Moscicki study, whereas HPV21 represented the main \u03b21 type [45]. A different pattern of \u03b2 types could be related to a different cellular input as described in a previous study [46], where several \u03b2 HPV types showed essentially increasing prevalence with increasing DNA input. Beta HPV types 8, 14, 20, 21, 23, 38, and 92 showed increased prevalence only in higher DNA input groups [46]. This may impose compromises in comparisons between studies; for example, our HPV38 negative result could be explained by an insufficient DNA input in the PCR assay. Further research is needed to establish whether there is an influence between cell number input and HPV \u03b2 detection in oropharyngeal anatomical site and which cut-off would be suggested to avoid false negative results. Possible type-specific differences in sensitivity to cellular input have to be evaluated in wider studies. If they are confirmed, they may be explained by the different sensitivities in detection systems and/or in the different viral load spectra. We detected 9 \u03b1 strains in anal site FAP primers that had not been typed by Genomica, and 2 \u03b22 types, HPV9 and HPV37, that had not been reported among oropharyngeal swabs. \u0392eta types frequency was sensibly lower to that found by Luminex system reported by Torres et al. [17] which found 65.6% of \u03b2 types in anal swabs from HIV positive MSM and 59.1% among HIV negative MSM. In this study, HPV12 and HPV 107 were the prevalent types among \u03b21 species, while HPV38 and HPV120 were the most frequently observed \u03b22 types. Among \u03b3 genus, the \u03b310 species was the most prevalent in both MSM HIV positive and -negative groups, while we observed only \u03b3 untyped strains. Don\u00e0 reported higher prevalence of \u03b2 (27.6%) and \u03b3 types (29.3%) in a group of MSM similar to ours using the Luminex system [16]. Some hypothesis could put forth to explain these data: i) The Luminex system could be much more sensitive than the FAP system, or ii) that cross-reactivity could occur in \u03b2 and \u03b3 types detection when \u03b1 multiple infections are present. In literature, cross-reactivity was also observed among \u03b1 genotypes. Preisler observed cross-reactivity both in LR and HR genotypes using HC2, COBAS, and APTIMA assays, despite what manufacturer claims: about 25% of HPVDNA results in primary screening accounting for cross-reactivity, regardless of the assay [47]. To obtain improved analytical and clinical performance, cross-reactivity studies should be focused, since this aspect could influence the effectiveness in a future head neck HPV cancer screening.",

Different sensitivity and specificity of HPV detection methods were also a problem in the determination of \u03b1 HPV types, as described in a systematic review where approximately 30\u201360% of all positive results showed discordance [50].
