Co-infection was frequently found in HBoV-positive patients. Thus, whether HBoV is responsible for the respiratory disease is still arguable. Objectives: A comprehensive study was carried out to integrate clinical and virological prevalence in HBoV-positive outpatient children, and to determine genetic and serologic characteristics of HBoV in Shanghai, China. Study design: Nasal/throat swabs and sera were obtained over a 2-year period from 817 children with respiratory tract infection to examine the presence of HBoV and its co-infection. The seroepidemiology of HBoV was studied by ELISA and Western blot against the capsid protein VP2-based fragment. Persistence of HBoV was also analyzed in 12 pairs of return-visit cases. Results: HBoV was identified in 96 samples (11.8%). The co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 51%. IgM was detected in 55.7% of HBoV RT-PCR-positive patients, and in 72.7% of those who had high viral genome load. In addition, persistent viral DNA positivity was detected in 10 of 12 HBoV-positive cases tested, an average of 14 days later, and one child was still HBoV-positive after 31 days. Conclusion: HBoV was found frequently in children with respiratory tract symptoms associated with other respiratory viruses, and persisted in the respiratory tract and in serum and urine.

The high ratio of these two co-infecting viruses may reflect their prevalence in children visiting the Pediatrics Department of Shanghai Nanxiang Hospital with ARI (Wang and Deubel, unpublished data). In addition, the percentage of HBoV-positive patients with co-infecting viruses was 47.6%, suggesting a correlation between the presence of HBoV and that of other respiratory viruses (p < 0.0001). Patients with lower copies of HBoV were more frequently associated with co-infection, as previously reported. 32, 33 Conversely, data published in a recent paper 25 reported a higher co-infection rate in patients with high HBoV load. It was probably Previous studies reported that the majority of epitopes recognized by antibodies in HBoV-infected patients were located in the VP2 protein. 20 In this study, we divided VP2 into 4 fragments (P1-P4) and tested their antigenic reactivity by Western blot. Sixteen of 20 sera contained IgG/IgM antibodies that reacted with VP2 and its P3 fragment, and four did not show reactivity with VP2 and any of the four fragments. Strong immunoreactivity with IgG and IgM was observed for fragment P3, consistent with results with the whole VP2 protein. However, preparation of large amounts of purified P3 antigen in E. coli is easier and cheaper than that of VP2, which requires a more tedious preparation in the baculovirus system. Therefore, the purified P3 fragment of VP2 represents an alternative antigen for IgG detection in ELISA to test for acute or recent infection. It remains to be determined, however, whether this polypeptide is still recognized by long lasting antibodies to prevent false negative result for past HBoV infection. 20, 24, 33 The number of IgG-positive cases increased with the age of the children, suggesting that infection of HBoV likely occurred during childhood. The data validate other studies that showed a high number of IgGpositive serum samples in adults. 23, 24 Since some previous studies reported the absence or only few cases of anti-HBoV IgM in virusnegative samples from children, and rare positive results in healthy adults, 24, 25 only sera of patients confirmed with HBoV infection were tested by Western blot for IgM. Anti-HBoV IgM antibodies were likely detected more often in patients viremic for HBoV or with high copies of HBoV in nasal and throat swabs, as previously observed. 20, 24, 25 In 11 patients with viremia, high copy number in swabs, and infected only by HBoV, 10 (90.9%) were IgM-positive, which is consistent with previous studies. 20, 25 Patients infected singly with HBoV had comparatively more anti-HBoV IgM and IgG than multi-infection ones (p = 0.0119) ( Table 4 ). In contrast, in 57 patients with low viral load in swab samples, the amount of IgG or IgM remained at a low level (data not shown).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 637, "end": 640, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 641, "end": 643, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 917, "end": 919, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1812, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1816, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1817, "end": 1819, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2062, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2065, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2235, "end": 2238, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2241, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2496, "end": 2499, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2500, "end": 2503, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2506, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2666, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2667, "end": 2669, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2791, "end": 2798, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Persistent HBoV shedding was reported in a few patients with symptoms lasting for several weeks, 9, 25 and in immunocompromised children. 4, 27, 34, 35 In this study, 12 patients were called for a second visit within an interval of 8-31 days (Table 5) . No fever or symptoms of the respiratory tract were noted in these patients. Low copies of HBoV were still found in nasal and throat swabs, serum, and urine, indicating that infection of HBoV may last for a long period of time at a low level, and in the presence of anti-HBoV antibodies (Table 5 ). This situation was also observed in parvovirus B19 infection with systemic and long-term persistent infection, high IgG reactivity and activated CD8+ T cell responses. 36 All ten patients with persistent PCR positivity of HBoV were found to be free of respiratory disease, but three were diagnosed with a secondary infection with ADV or HRV, suggesting that the persistence of HBoV was of less clinical significance, but may have played a role in promoting co-infection. Altogether, our study suggests that acute infection of HBoV causes systemic infection, induces immune responses, and may play a crucial role in respiratory disease of children, and is often associated with co-infection.
