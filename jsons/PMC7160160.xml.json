Hospitals in Italy during this pandemic seem overwhelmed, leaving physicians with little guidance on how to triage patients and allocate therapeutic resources.1 Based on current rates of critical care admission in China and Italy, in a worst-case scenario, Canada would have a deficit of thousands of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the peak of a national epidemic\u2014a problem that will disproportionately affect older adults. This highlights the necessity of sound geriatric principles in the emergency department (ED) that incorporate the essential concept of frailty. We propose that a structured, evidence-based assessment of frailty, and not just noting the person's age, will help guide ED care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Although they explicitly recognize that age should not be the only consideration, these recommendations seem to propagate the misguided notion that being elderly and being frail are synonymous. We speculate that the decision was based on an observation that patients presenting with comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and immunocompromising conditions, have higher COVID-19 mortality.2 However, the correlation between polymorbidity and age is far from perfect, due to the heterogeneity of aging.3",

The proposed method of triage published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom takes a slightly different approach. Instead of making decisions based on chronological age, the NICE COVID-19 Rapid Guideline: Critical Care proposes screening based on frailty for decisions regarding level of care.5 Frailty is characterized by widespread physiological declines across many systems that can leave a person more susceptible to health stressors, such as infection.6 Frail individuals are also more likely to present with a variety of comorbidities that each contribute to poor outcomes. While frailty is often associated with older age, purely age-based criteria are frequently inaccurate, as younger people can also present with frailty, and many older people are healthy and robust.7 Assessing frailty is already an unconscious part of an emergency physician's assessment of patients, but can be done in a more structured and evidence-based way.",

Strategies for identifying frailty are often based on a balance between efficacy and feasibility in a specific setting. The COVID-19 guideline presented by NICE proposes the use of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS).8 The CFS, developed by Canadian geriatrician Kenneth Rockwood, is a simple one-page \u201cfrailty cheat sheet,\u201d which provides nine pictograms and brief descriptions to place patients on a scale from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill). Patient placement on this scale is based on evaluation by an experienced clinician using a summary assessment of health and recent function to estimate their level of frailty or robustness. This tool has been validated and successfully used in multiple settings, including those where more extensive testing is not feasible.9 It is a rapid and ED-friendly method already used in every National Health Service (NHS) ED in the United Kingdom, and seems practical to use in the context of COVID-19 patients presenting to an overwhelmed hospital (Figure 1).\n",

This is simplified for contexts such as the ED by the validated Clinical Frailty Scale. (2) Consider the risk-benefit for this patient. Avoid basing treatment on evidence from studies of patients who are not like this patient. (3) Discuss goals of care.

Faced with this difficulty, Canadian physicians may consider using frailty assessments as a means of improving care in this pandemic scenario. Research should prioritize studying outcomes of older patients and frail patients with COVID-19 to better characterize these populations and inform decision-making. In these uncertain times, we need to realize that it is likely not age, but rather frailty, that best contributes to outcome prediction. After all, the more encouraging interpretation of the mortality statistics in Italy for COVID-19 patients over 80 years of age is that over 80% are surviving.10",
