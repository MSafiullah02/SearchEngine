One of the major problems of modern chemotherapy is the disappointing efficacy when using available drugs against resistant bacterial strains. Natural antibiotics, i.e., antibiotics produced by various microorganisms, have been and continue to be an important source of new highly active antimicrobial and antitumour agents. One of the most relevant approaches to the design of new drugs relies on targeted chemical transformations of natural antibiotics.1",

However, in comparison with other drugs, the development of new antibiotics is not carried out sufficiently. The design of anti-infective drugs and the creation of marketable products are still a challenge.2 Since the development of medicines for the treatment of chronic diseases is much more profitable and because of high requirements for safety, large cap pharmaceutical companies (big pharma) shut down their antibiotic research projects. Currently, small- and medium-sized enterprises are developing a majority of new drugs through investments, venture capital, etc. Because of high demands for new anti-infective drugs and extremely high cost of these works, cross-country collaborations are needed for research in this field. Only a few new compounds were approved for therapeutic use in human medicine or have completed phase-III clinical trials.3 The problems are compounded by the fact that the increasing percentage of the population, particularly in developed countries and Russia, suffer from infections that were not earlier dangerous, i.e., from opportunistic infections. This is due to a significant decrease in the immune status of the population caused by natural or man-made factors.",

Many antibiotics have made a great contribution to understanding of mechanisms of development of resistance in bacterial and tumour cells. Due to high innate or acquired drug resistance of cancer cells, chemotherapy of malignant tumours is often ineffective. The international research community has focused its attention on the search for new, more effective and less toxic antitumour agents. One of the most rational approaches to the targeted therapy is based on the search for inhibitors of important tumour cell targets among natural products, primarily antibiotics.4 Even the repurposing of known antitumour antibiotics is considered in order to address the problem of antibiotic resistance of anti-infective agents.5",

Chemical transformations of natural antibiotics imply a change of particular functional groups of the starting molecules with preservation of structural elements responsible for biological activity. The structure determines the possibility of chemical transformation of the antibiotic and reaction conditions. For example, many antibiotics contain nitrogenous and(or) nitrogen-free sugars, which are easily eliminated in acidic or alkaline media. Many antibiotics are sensitive to oxidants, are poorly soluble in organic media or, on the contrary, in aqueous solutions, etc. On the other hand, in the case of similar structures of certain moieties [e.g., the presence of NH2, CO2H, OH, C(O), etc. groups)], methods developed for one class of antibiotics can be applied to antibiotics of another class. The goal of synthetic chemists is to transform natural products with preservation of the sites responsible for biological activity. Besides, targeted modification can be performed to gain better understanding of the mechanisms of action, in particular in order to investigate the interaction between the antibiotic and the target.",

The 15N- or F-containing antibiotic that was added to the medium inhibits bacterial growth by forming a stable complex with 13C-labelled peptidoglycan moieties (see Fig. 2, hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines).19, 20 The study of the complex with compound 10 provides an estimate of the distance from [15N]-amide of the asparagine moiety of eremomycin to D-[13C(1)]Ala4-D-[13C(1)]Ala5 of the terminal group of the peptidoglycan (\u223c4.5 \u00c5, see Fig. 2, an empty arrow). The distance between the C-terminal [15N]-amide of eremomycin (10) and L-[13C(3)]Ala1 of the peptidoglycan stem is 3.5 \u00c5 (see Fig. 2, a solid arrow).20 Consequently, higher activity of eremomycin amide 10 (compared to antibiotics 1 or 3) against resistant VISA staphylococci can be attributed to the fact that this compound interacts with the peptidoglycan not only via a classical model (i.e., with the D-Ala-D-Ala target) but also with the L-[13C(3)]Ala group of its stem. Besides, there is an additional binding site of derivative 11 to the target, which can also account for its high antibacterial activity against VRE and VISA.21",

The mechanism of their action is related to the interaction with the decoding site (A site) of the 16S subunit of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), which leads to disturbance of translation, i.e., protein biosynthesis. According to the literature data, a number of semi-synthetic derivatives of a new generation were synthesized based on aminoglycosides.33 Various heterodimeric aminoglycoside conjugates with other antibiotics were reported, and some of them are used in medicine.28, 29 The synthesis of hybrid kanamycin A conjugates with glycopeptides 1 and 3 was described for the first time in our publication.34",

This can be due to the fact that the imine bonds in the 3\u2032-N-L-lysyldoxorubicin \u2013 DAVANAT conjugate (148) are more stable than those in conjugate 146. It should be noted that 3\u2032-N-L-lysyldoxorubicin is not released in in vitro assays.
