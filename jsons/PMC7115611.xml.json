            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first emerged 12 years ago as a highly contagious infectious disease, caused by a then novel human coronavirus, termed SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1]. The virus spread to 25 countries in a short period of three months, affecting a total of 8098 people globally including 774 deaths, a fatality rate of 10% [2]. SARS-CoV is believed to have originated from bats [3], [4], [5] and transmitted to human through intermediate animals such as civet cats [6]. Although no SARS cases have been reported since 2004, the re-emergence of SARS-CoV is of public health concern due to the continual persistence of SARS-CoVs and SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) in bat reservoirs. The SARS-CoV is classified in the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and genus betacoronavirus (lineage B). It is an enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded RNA virus of a genome size of 29.7 kb, encoding 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), 4 structural proteins (spike [S], membrane [M], nucleocapsid [N], envelope [E]) and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9) proteins [7].",

In humans, decreased T cell numbers (lymphopenia) correlated with severe disease, indicating the critical role of T cell-mediated immune response in disease development [11], [12]. While SARS-specific antibody level in SARS-recovered individuals is undetectable at 6 years post-infection, SARS-specific memory T cells persisted up to 6 years following recovery [13]. The long-term persistence of memory T cell immunity could be important in protection against SARS-CoV re-infection. In this study, the presence of SARS-specific T cells was screened in three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post-infection. The characterization of CD8+ T cell responses against the structural M and N proteins was carried out, including the determination of HLA restriction and the minimal T cell epitope. In addition, cross-reactivity of SARS-specific CD8+ T cells against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was investigated.",

Three are CD4+ T cell responses, of which two recognized the S protein (S104 and S109) and one recognized the N protein (N21). In addition, CD8+ memory T cell response specific for the SARS-CoV M protein (M29) was detected.

Memory T cell responses specific against SARS-CoV structural proteins were also found (Table 1). As with that observed in SARS subject 1, N21 CD4+ response and M29 CD8+ response were found in SARS subjects 2 and 3, respectively. SARS subject 3 also possessed a CD4+ T cell response targeting S217. As summarized in Table 1, subject 1 had more SARS-specific memory T cells at higher frequencies compared to the other two subjects. It was noted that subject 1 had more severe disease presentation (Supplementary Table 2), which could be related to the more robust T cell responses detected. However, the number of subjects recruited in this study is too small to draw a conclusion to this correlation. The knowledge that SARS-CoV structural proteins are highly immunogenic in eliciting protective and immunodominant T cell responses is well-established [16], [17], [18]. The CD4+ T cell epitopes identified here, which are specific against S104 (S protein residues 516\u2013530), S109 (S protein residues 541\u2013555), S217 (S protein residues 1081\u20131095) and N21 (N protein residues 101\u2013115), have been previously reported from a cohort of SARS-recovered patients at 1 year post-infection, suggesting the immunoprevalence and dominance of these responses in convalescent SARS patients [16]. Here, the identification of T cell responses against SARS-CoV structural S, N and M proteins at 9 and 11 years post-infection suggests the long-term persistence of these responses.",

In our previous study performed at 6 years post-SARS, several SARS-specific T cell epitopes within the N protein were reported [13]. In SARS subject 1 at 6 years post-infection, a HLA-B*1525-restricted memory CD8+ T cell response targeting the N53 peptide, corresponding to residues 261\u2013275 of N protein, was detected. To determine the minimal epitope of the N53 CD8+ T cell response, truncated peptides were tested for induction of CD8+ T cell response using PBMCs from SARS subject 1 previously collected at 6 years post-infection. Truncated peptides consisted of 8- to 10-mers within the 10 overlapping residues between N53 and N54 peptides, as the N54 peptide is also capable of inducing the response (data not shown). It was found that 10-mer peptide, N53266\u2013275, corresponding to residues 266\u2013275 of the N protein, was most efficient in inducing N53T cell response of 12.7% (Table 3\n). Deletion of N-terminal threonine (T) residue and C-terminal phenylalanine (F) residue from N53266\u2013275 led to decrease in percentages of IFN\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells to 10.9% and 8.0%, respectively. This indicates that residues 266\u2013275 are the minimal epitope of the N53 CD8+ T cell response. In previous study using bioinformatics NetMHCpan algorithm, the predicted minimal epitope for the N53 response was determined to be 9 amino acids at position 267\u2013275 [25], which is within the 10-mer region identified in current study.

Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus which causes serious and sometimes fatal lower respiratory tract infections and extrapulmonary manifestations [28], [29]. Contrary to SARS-CoV which is a lineage B betacoronavirus, MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C [30]. To investigate if SARS-specific M29 and N53 CD8+ T cells can cross-react with M and N peptides of MERS-CoV, sequence alignments were done to identify corresponding M29 and N53 minimal epitopes of MERS-CoV (Fig. 4A and B). When M29- and N53-restimulated T cells were stimulated with MERS-CoV M29 minimal epitope peptide (HLKMAGMHF) and N53 minimal epitope peptide (TKSFNMVQAF), no CD8+IFN\u03b3+ responses were observed (Fig. 4C), indicating the inability of these SARS-specific T cells to be activated by MERS-CoV peptides. Therefore, T cell immunity against SARS-CoV is highly specific and M29 and N53 CD8+ T cell responses are unlikely to provide cross-protection against MERS-CoV infection. This is expected as MERS-CoV is distantly related to SARS-CoV and is more closely related to other bat coronaviruses [30]. Nonetheless, sequence alignments revealed that the M29 and N53 minimal epitopes are fully conserved between human and zoonotic strains (Fig. 4A and B), including civet SARS-CoV SZ3, bat SL-CoVs Rp3 and Rf1, and the bat SARS-CoV Rs3367 which is capable of utilizing both human and bat ACE2 receptors for cell entry [5]. Hence, it is likely that the SARS-specific M29 and N53 CD8+ T cells can confer cross-protection against infections of these zoonotic SARS-CoV and SL-CoV strains.",

In this study, it was demonstrated that SARS-specific memory T cells persist in three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post-SARS in the absence of antigen. All memory T cells detected were specific against SARS-CoV structural S, N and M proteins. Two immunodominant CD8+ T cell responses specific against M (M29) and N (N53) proteins were further characterized by defining the minimal epitope and HLA restriction. These CD8+ T cell responses continued to persist in a SARS-recovered subject up to 11 years post-infection. The persistence of T cell responses suggests that SARS-recovered patients could be protected from re-infection.",

It was also noted that the availability of three convalescent individuals is a significant constraint of this study. In future studies, the conclusions drawn here could be substantiated by including more SARS-recovered subjects.",
