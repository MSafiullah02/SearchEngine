With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) initial focus on bioterrorism preparedness at the state and local level in 1999 and the subsequent anthrax outbreak of 2001, the public health system and medical care community in the United States have wrestled with developing new and more accurate methods for earlier detection of threats to the health of the public. Earlier detection, both intuitively and as illustrated through predictive mathematical models, is believed to save lives, prevent morbidity and preserve resources (Kaufman et al, 1997). Biosurveillance systems use health-related data that generally precede diagnoses and that signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response (Buehler et al., 2004).",

Electronic emergency department (ED) records are a major source of data for biosurveillance systems because these data are timely, population-based and widely available in electronic form (Lober et al., 2002; Teich et al., 2002). There are more than 115 million ED visits annually in the United States, and EDs represent the only universally accessible source of outpatient healthcare that is available 24 h a day, 7 days a week (Nawar et al., 2007). EDs see patients from all age groups and socioeconomic classes. Patients may present with early, nonspecific symptoms or with advanced disease. The accessibility of EDs provides a likely healthcare setting for many of the patients involved in a disease outbreak of public health significance. In recent years, EDs have steadily adopted electronic medical records technology (Hirshon, 2000), which has facilitated the replacement of drop-in manual surveillance using ED data with ongoing, real-time surveillance. ED data have been shown to detect outbreaks 1\u20132 weeks earlier than traditional\npublic health reporting channels (Heffernan et al., 2004; Lober et al, 2002; Tsui et al., 2001; Wagner et al, 2004).",

The most widely used ED data element is the chief complaint because it is recorded electronically by most EDs and may precede entry of a diagnosis or transcription of physician notes by days or weeks (Travers et al., 2003, 2006). The triage note increases the amount of data available, which makes it more likely that biosurveillance algorithms will detect disease outbreaks. Triage notes are becoming more available in electronic form, and one study found that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of outbreak detection (Ising et al., 2006).",

Many EDs still document patient symptoms manually; even when the data are electronic, they are often entered in free text form instead of using standardized terms. Timeliness is also a concern; while some ED data elements are entered into electronic systems at the start of the ED visit, other elements are added hours, days or even weeks later. Even though there is no formal standard or best practices dictating how soon data should be available after an ED visit or other health system encounter for early detection, most surveillance systems aim for near real-time data, available within hours.",

NC DETECT has since grown to incorporate ED visit data from 98% of 24/7 acute care hospital EDs in the state of North Carolina and has developed and implemented many innovative surveillance tools, including the Emergency Medicine Text Processor (EMT-P) for ED chief complaint data and research-based syndrome definitions. NC DETECT now provides twice-daily ED data feeds to CDC\u2019s BioSense and has over 200 registered users at the state, regional and local levels across North Carolina. This chapter will review the use of ED data for biosurveillance, including appropriate case studies from NC DETECT.",

            "text": "ED data have been collected for decades for a variety of public health surveillance needs and have been incorporated into electronic systems designed to analyze data related to trauma, injury and substance abuse, among others. Public health officials have used event-based or drop-in biosurveillance systems that include ED data during major events, including the Olympic Games, political conventions, heat waves, after major hurricanes, and after the identification of known widespread outbreaks (Weiss et al., 1988; Davis et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1993; Rydman et al., 1999). Many of these systems have required users to do manual abstractions from medical charts or to enter data into stand-alone systems for specific symptoms of interest. For example, the EMERGEncy ID NET program, established in the late 1990s, created a network of select EDs to manually collect data to study syndromes related to emerging infections of interest to the CDC, using paper forms and standardized computer screens (Talan et al., 1998).\nSecondary data, data that are generated as part of normal patient treatment and billing, are generally extracted from hospital information system(s) through automated programs either in real-time (at the time of record generation) or near real-time (hourly, every 12 h, daily). Surveillance systems that use secondary data are intended to be less burdensome to ED staff and less costly than systems requiring manual abstraction (Rodewald et al., 1992). This methodology of ED data collection has become standard practice for biosurveillance systems using ED data, including NC DETECT, RODS, ESSENCE and EARS, among others (Hutwagner et al., 2003; Ising et al., 2006; Lombardo, 2003; Wagner et al, 2004). While there are several different approaches to automated extraction programs, most rely either on delimited text batch files or HL7 messages.",

Syndrome definitions then classify records into syndromic categories based on which symptoms are identified. To date, no best practices exist to guide syndrome definition development and evaluation (Sosin & DeThomasis, 2004). Which syndromes are monitored and which symptoms are associated with each syndrome varies according to the system under consideration. Furthermore, syndrome structure may vary depending upon which data elements, in addition to chief complaint, are available and their timeliness. Syndrome structure refers to how many symptoms are required, within which data fields they must be found, and which Boolean operators are employed to determine whether a certain record matches a particular syndrome.",

At this meeting, representatives from eleven syndromic surveillance systems throughout the country, including NC DETECT, met to discuss which syndromes they monitor and which chief complaint-based clinical conditions they include in each syndrome. Clinical conditions are medical concepts which may be represented by multiple possible data inputs to the system. For example, the concept of \u201cdyspnea\u201d may be represented by signs and symptoms of dyspnea as recorded in an ED chief complaint or triage note field (e.g., \u201cShortness of Breath\u201d (SOB)), a clinical observation such as an abnormal vital sign (e.g., low oxygen saturations or increased respiratory rate), clinical findings (e.g., abnormal breath sounds on pulmonary exam), abnormal lab findings (e.g., abnormal ABG or positive culture results), imaging studies (e.g., infiltrate on chest x-ray), or certain ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (e.g., 486, pneumonia). The meeting participants reached consensus on best practices for which clinical conditions to associate with each of six different syndromes (sensitive and specific versions of respiratory and gastrointestinal syndrome, constitutional syndrome and influenza-like illness syndrome). Through online collaboration and periodic conference calls, the group continues the process of defining specific chief complaint search terms/keywords which best represent these clinical conditions.",

All EDs generate electronic ICD-9-CM diagnoses as they are required for billing purposes (NCIPC, 1997; Travers et al., 2003). There is, however, some evidence that diagnosis data are not always available in a timely manner. In contrast to chief complaint data, which are generally entered into ED information systems by clinicians in real-time, ICD-9-CM diagnoses are often entered into the system by coders well after the ED visit. Sources of ICD-9-CM data may vary, which may influence the quality of the data. Traditionally, diagnoses have been assigned to ED visits by trained coders who are employed by the hospital and/or physician professional group. The primary purpose of the coding is billing, as opposed to secondary uses such as surveillance. Recently, emergency department information systems (EDIS) have come on the market that allow for diagnosis entry by clinicians. These systems typically include drop-down boxes with text that corresponds to ICD-9-CM codes; clinicians can then select a \u201cclinical impression\u201d at the end of the ED visit and the corresponding ICD-9-CM code becomes part of the EDIS data available for surveillance.",

In a follow up study, researchers prospectively measured the time of availability of electronic ICD-9-CM codes in NC DETECT for all ED visits on 12/1/05 (Travers et al., 2006). The study confirmed that\nfewer than half of the EDs sent diagnoses within 1 week of the visit, and that it took 3 weeks to get at least one diagnosis for two-thirds of the visits. Seven (12%) of the hospitals had diagnoses for less than two-thirds of their ED visits at the 12 week mark. Diagnosis data are universally available from NC EDs, and studies have shown that ICD-9-CM data alone or in combination with chief complaint data are more valid than chief complaint data alone for syndromic surveillance (Beitel et al., 2004; Fleischauer et al., 2004; Reis & Mandl, 2004).

These syndromes were selected because they encompass both potential bioterrorism-related and community acquired disease processes. They include botulism-like illness (botulism), fever-rash (anthrax, bubonic plague, smallpox, tularemia, varicella), gastrointestinal (gastrointestinal anthrax, food/water-borne gastrointestinal illness, viral gastroenteritis), influenza-like-illness (epidemic influenza, pandemic influenza), meningoencephalitis (meningitis, encephalitis) and respiratory (respiratory anthrax, pneumonic plague, tularemia, influenza, SARS). Clinical case definitions are converted to syndrome definitions by expressing them in SQL, in most cases requiring both a syndrome specific and a constitutional keyword in either the chief complaint or triage note field. For example, a record containing the syndrome specific term \u201ccough\u201d and the constitutional term \u201cfever\u201d would match the respiratory syndrome. Documentation of a fever by vital sign measurement in the ED is also accepted in lieu of a constitutional keyword. The SQL code is written to identify common synonyms, acronyms, abbreviation, truncations, misspellings and negation in the free text data. The NC DETECT syndrome definitions have been modified over several years in an iterative fashion according to the knowledge and experience of the NC DETECT Syndrome Definition Workgroup. This workgroup meets monthly and includes public health\nepidemiologists who are regular users of NC DETECT for biosurveillance at the state and local levels, as well as clinicians and technical staff at NC DETECT. The continued improvement of the syndrome definitions for the purposes of syndromic surveillance requires more than this local effort, however.

In addition to timeliness, collecting ED data for influenza surveillance allows jurisdictions to assess impact on populations rather than samples, test case definition revisions on historical data, stratify ED visits by disposition type (admitted vs. discharged) and incorporate age stratification into analyses. The use of age groups in influenza surveillance has been shown to provide timely and representative information about the age-specific epidemiology of circulating influenza viruses (Olsen et al., 2007). Several states and large metropolitan areas, along with North Carolina, transmit aggregate ED-based ILI counts by age group to an ISDS-sponsored proof-of-concept project called the Distributed Surveillance Taskforce for Real-time Influenza Burden Tracking (DiSTRIBuTE). Although the ILI case definitions are locally defined, the visualizaions that DiSTRIBuTE provides show striking similarities in ILI trends across the country (http://www.syndromic.org/projects/DiSTRIBuTE.htm).",

            "text": "While syndromic surveillance systems have clearly shown benefit for public health situational awareness and influenza surveillance, early event detection has been more of a challenge. Symptom-based detection systems are often overly sensitive, resulting in many false positives that can drain limited resources (Baer et al., 2007; Heffernan et al., 2004). Hospital and public health users who incorporate syndromic surveillance into their daily work flows, however, are able to accommodate these false positives more efficiently and still derive benefit from monitoring ED data for potential events. Investigating aberrations based on ED data that do not result in detecting an outbreak can still be important to confirm that nothing out of the ordinary is occurring. A recent investigation of gastrointestinal signals in Pitt County, North Carolina, for example, resulted in more active surveillance by the health department (checking non-ED data sources for similar trends) and the hospital (increased stool testing), as well as a health department press release promoting advice for preventing foodborne illnesses. Although a true outbreak or signal causative agent was not detected, this work results in improved coordination and communication among the hospital, healthcare providers and health department, which will make collaboration more efficient in any future large scale response efforts.",

The ED data stream of NC DETECT has undergone two such evaluations. In 2007, it was evaluated by the North Carolina Center for Public Health Preparedness at the charge of the NC DPH. The evaluation was designed to determine the usefulness of the ED data and the ease with which it is used for both realtime and non-real-time public health surveillance activities. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders to learn about the specifics of the ED data, data flow, and the aberration detection algorithms. In addition, local, regional and state public health authorities, as well as hospital-based public health\nepidemiologists (PHEs), were asked to complete a Web-based survey about their experience using the ED data via NC DETECT. Key findings included:\nED data permit public health authorities to identify human health events as a result of bioterrorism, natural or accidental disaster, or infectious disease outbreak, but the rapidity of detection is contingent on the extent of the event and affected individuals, the ability of chief complaint data to be successfully transmitted to NC DETECT in a timely manner, and the frequency and timing of aberration detection and investigation by public health authorities;The NC statute mandating provision of ED visit data for public health surveillance and the availability of UNC DEM staff to provide technical and analytical expertise have been instrumental in assuring that timely, quality data are available for public health surveillance;ED data are useful to public health authorities;The system showed a low positive predictive value (PPV), indicating that users must examine a large number of false positives in order to identify a potentially true threat to public health.\n",
