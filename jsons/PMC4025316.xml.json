A research team from their previous work did elucidate that a group 2 CoV was found in a bat Pipistrellus pipistrellus, in Europe. Four verspertilionid bat species were found to excrete group 1 CoVs, viz. Myotis daubentonii, Myotis dasycneme, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and Nyctalus noctula[10]. They have also affirmed that the European Pipistrellus bat-derived CoVs that are closely related to MERS-CoV. Another study by Drexler et al. did confirm that novel clade 2c betacoronaviruses in Nycteris bats were phylogenetically related to the novel hCoV EMC/2012[11]. Knowledge of the close relatedness of PML/2011 and MERS-CoV, which contrasts with the more distant relatedness of CoVs in bats from the Americas and Asia, enables speculations of an African origin for bat reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV ancestors. Corona viruses were very much amplified in bat maternity colonies in temperate climates[12]. Fecal samples were collected on tarps laid out at bat roosting sites in and around Bisha, Unaizah, and Riyadh also suggested that bats can probably transmit the virus. Technically, no CoV virus has not been directly isolated from any bats. However, there is a need for high research activities to be included in countries where there is high prevalence of this virus.",
