In the same way, we found that 8% of the pandemic influenza cases were hospital-acquired. Hospitalacquired influenza infection in SOTR, even in the early postoperative period, and the adverse outcomes in cases occurring within the first 3 months after the transplant, prompt some considerations. First, early influenza diagnosis and treatment should be considered in the presence of influenzalike symptoms, especially in cases of pneumonia, in pandemic or seasonal influenza periods, even in the immediate posttransplant period. Secondly, these patients should be considered a high-risk population, and therefore measures to avoid in-hospital transmission should be rigorous, with implementation of infection control measures, such as isolation of infected patients, and avoidance of contact with symptomatic caregivers. In this sense, it is necessary to increase the rate of vaccination among SOTR and close contacts to confer indirect protection for those who are non-responders to vaccine.",

Risk factors for non-viral co-infection in patients with pandemic influenza A have not been previously described. In this study, two associated factors at influenza diagnosis have been identified: diabetes mellitus and septic shock. On the other hand, non-viral co-infections were not diagnosed in mild cases without pneumonia. These findings may suggest that nonsevere cases could be managed without antibacterial therapy, reducing the number of patients exposed to antibiotics, in our case two-thirds of the patients.",

However, they offer information regarding this illness in transplant patients with severe disease needing hospital admission. Second, as susceptibility to oseltamivir was not performed, we could not conclude whether fatal cases were related to oseltamivir resistance. Third, the possibility of graft rejection was only histologically evaluated if it was clinically evident, which could lead to misdiagnoses of mild allograft rejections.",

An effort should be made to increase vaccination among SOTR and caregivers.",
