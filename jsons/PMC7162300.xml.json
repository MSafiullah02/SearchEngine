            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) was first identified in 1969 in California, when it was isolated from the feces of an infant suffering from encephalitis (Schmidt et al., 1974). Subsequently, EV71 was reported as the agent involved in severe neurological diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis, monoplegia and acute flaccid paralysis. The virus is also associated with non\u2010neurological diseases like hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina and pulmonary oedema. Among young children, EV71 is a notable cause of central nervous system (CNS) disease that usually results in rapid clinical deterioration and death, the molecular pathogenesis of which is still elusive (Kehle et al., 2003). In Singapore, the major EV71 outbreak in 2000 involved 6402 cases with four deaths (Singh et al., 2002a), and prompted the closure of pre\u2010school centres for about 2 weeks. In 2001, there were 5187 cases of HFMD with EV71 as the predominant agent, with 75% of afflicted children below the age of four.",

            "text": "Belonging to the Picornaviridae, which comprises a large complex family of small non\u2010enveloped, positive\u2010strand RNA viruses with a genome size of about 7\u20139 kb, EV71 is known to induce an apoptotic response via its viral proteins such as 2A (Kuo et al., 2002) and 3C (Li et al., 2002). This is also observed in the related and widely studied poliovirus (Barco et al., 2000; Goldstaub et al., 2000; Calandria et al., 2004), which belongs to the same genus as EV71. Apoptosis is a complex mechanism that involves a network of cross\u2010talk and multiple specifically controlled pathways. The process may be triggered by the interactions of the pro\u2010apoptotic stimuli with various sensors such as the receptor\u2010mediated pathway through caspase 8, mitochondrial\u2010related pathway through caspase 9 (Desagher and Martinou, 2000) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\u2010triggered pathway through caspase 12 (Nakagawa et al., 2000). Apoptosis in viral infection is the host response to lyse prematurely in order to curtail the reproductive cycle of the virus (Clem and Miller, 1993). In addition, the significance of apoptosis is to enable macrophages to phagocytose dead cells in order to prevent dysregulated inflammatory reactions, and to initiate specific immune responses in the infected host (Sun and Shi, 2001). However, the immune response can also result in apoptosis of uninfected cells, which causes enhanced immunosuppression or specific organ toxicity (Ahr et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Besides apoptosis, the other host response is the development of canonical cytopathic effect (CPE) following productive poliovirus infection, which often leads to inflammation. Thus, the interplay of the two cell death processes highlights both apoptotic and antiapoptotic effects of poliovirus (Agol et al., 2000; Belov et al., 2003; Romanova et al., 2005). It is postulated that in early infection during which the poliovirus RNA genome is translated, sufficient quantities of pro\u2010apoptotic proteins are synthesized to trigger an early apoptotic response. However, with the onset of viral replication, the apoptotic response is interrupted by the apoptosis\u2010suppressing effect of the virus, which dominates the entire period of productive infection. Only at the later stages of infection such as after the development of CPE, can some signs of apoptosis be obvious (Carthy et al., 1998). Although many RNA viruses do not encode antiapoptotic genes and the mechanism of this apoptosis\u2010suppressing effect is still unclear, enterovirus 2B protein which exhibits membrane permeabilizing activity (Agirre et al., 2002), may have a significant role. Campanella et al. (2004) also demonstrated that coxsackievirus 2B protein is able to suppress apoptotic host responses by manipulating intracellular calcium ion homeostasis.",

            "text": "In addition to the variability in apoptotic response, enteroviral infection instigates multiple cascades of host responses, especially mechanisms pertaining to its neuropathogenesis. These responses are also evident in infections with other viruses, e.g. dengue virus (Warke et al., 2003; Liew and Chow, 2004), herpes simplex virus (Kramer et al., 2003), JC virus (Radhakrishnan et al., 2003) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Leong et al., 2005). Understanding the molecular basis of the host response to microbial infection particularly antiapoptotic responses, is essential for identifying targets to prevent disease and tissue damage resulting from the inflammatory response. In our study of EV71 infection of rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, DNA microarray and two\u2010dimensional (2\u2010D) proteomic analyses were employed to probe into these molecular changes. The expression of the p53 tumour suppressor gene and its alternative splice variant in EV71\u2010infected cells was also investigated.",

The four models included uninfected control, mock\u2010infection control with UV\u2010inactivated EV71 reference strain MS/7423/87, EV71 strain MS/7423/87 infection, and EV71 strain 5865/Sin/000009 infection. The cell growth kinetics did not differ much at 8 h p.i. However, at 20 h p.i., a decrease in viable cell population was apparent in both EV71\u2010infected models (Fig. 1). Visible CPE was also observed in the infected cell culture, indicative of a full\u2010blown infection. It was speculated that in poliovirus\u2010infected cells, such CPE formation may be attributed to expression of the putative apoptosis\u2010preventing effect (Agol et al., 2000). Viable cell counts for the uninfected and mock\u2010infected controls were comparable without any potential \u2018spillover\u2019 effect from the inoculum itself, which may contain interleukins or interferons derived from the virus\u2010infected cell culture. There was also no visible effect in the cells subjected to the UV\u2010inactivated EV71. Thus, any evident changes that occurred in the infected cells were caused by the live virus itself.",

With the statistical program, we initially conducted a low\u2010intensity filtering based on the sum of medians of the foreground intensities of both channels that were less than 200. We selected this criterion as it allowed us to effectively disregard the low intensity spots while retaining 3736 spots of sufficient quality to be analysed. The filtered data were normalized by LOWESS analysis (Yang et al., 2002). Finally, we defined a Z\u2010score threshold to be greater than 1.96 based on the duplicated set, which permitted us to identify 191 genes that were differentially expressed at the 95% confidence level. Of these, 39 transcripts exhibited an increase while 152 demonstrated a decrease in expression level greater than twofold based on Acuity analysis (Table S1).

However, one\u2010dimensional separation and Western blot analysis of GAPDH in the same samples displayed equal intensities (data not shown). Each spot was expressed as relative volume with respect to all detected spots (% vol), and as absolute volume of the ID spot. The fold change was calculated as the percentage vol of infected divided by percentage vol of uninfected samples. Six distinct differentially expressed protein spots with greater than twofold changes in expression were identified (Fig. 5).

Only protein scores greater than 76 were considered as significant (P < 0.05). The analyses also correlated with the estimated molecular masses and isoelectric points of the corresponding spots, thereby further strengthening the validity of the results.

Interestingly, PSMA2 was also identified in the microarray as a downregulated transcript albeit at a different magnitude of fold change, thus lending further support to the microarray data.

RD cells are continuous, stable and can be cultivated in\u2010house without decreasing sensitivity even as the passage number increases. Notably, RD cells are derived from muscle tissue, and may offer some insights into the neuromuscular diseases caused by EV71, thus further warranting their use. Signs of late apoptotic responses detectable after the phase of active virus growth and the development of CPE (Romanova et al., 2005) in RD cells allowed us to probe into the apoptosis\u2010evading mechanism during productive infection. Pelletier et al. (1998) stated that the multiplicity of infection (moi) also plays an important role in the outcome of infection. A lower moi can leave the infected cell sufficient time to produce certain factors necessary for its survival. Thus, this prompted us to use an moi of 0.1 to investigate such a phenomenon. From the immunofluorescence staining of cells infected at an moi of 0.1, we observed huge aggregates of virions inside the infected cells as early as 8 h p.i. even though there was no visible CPE, which may imply a possible apoptosis\u2010evading mechanism to allow virus multiplication.",

Such host translational shutoff is frequently observed, as evidenced by infections with influenza virus type A (Garfinkel and Katze, 1992), herpes simplex virus (Everly et al., 2002), and poliovirus (Kuyumcu\u2010Martinez et al., 2004). The poliovirus protease 2A\u2010mediated cleavage of eIF4G, which is part of the host cap\u2010dependent translation initiation complex, causes a rapid shutoff of cap\u2010dependent translation (Krausslich et al., 1987), thereby shifting the host cell machinery from cellular to viral processes. The downregulation of eIF4A2 which is also part of the host translation initiation complex (Sudo et al., 1995), may contribute to host translational shutoff.",

Poliovirus infection is usually accompanied by rearrangement of the intermediate filament framework (Weed et al., 1985).

In EV71\u2010infected cells, the downregulation of TNNT1, which maps to the myotonic dystrophy region of human chromosome 19 (Novelli et al., 1992), may be implicated in the chronic inflammatory muscle disease or fibromyalgia of infected patients (Douche\u2010Aourik et al., 2003). Expression of the TPT1 microtubule\u2010stabilizing protein was also downregulated, which may promote an increase in microtubule dynamics (Yarm, 2002) observed in enterovirus infection. The guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity of TPT1 may also prevent eEF1A activation into eEF1A\u2010GTP before it is recruited by other components of the translational machinery to form a complex with a de novo\u2010aminoacylated tRNA (Cans et al., 2003). Thus, decreasing TPT1 expression in infected cells may be a means to decrease the efficiency of host protein synthesis, to stifle cell proliferation, which allows the host's resources to be channelled to virus replication. In addition, ODC1 enzyme which is involved in the cell cycle and possesses growth\u2010promoting activity (Moshier et al., 1990; Nemoto et al., 2002) exhibited reduced expression in infected cells that may serve to limit cell proliferation in support of virus replication.",

Its disruption will lead to an increase in hydrogen peroxide which can cause oxidative damage, and a decrease in cholesterol synthesis that may affect the integrity of cellular membranes. Furthermore, the synthesis of lipids for myelin production may also be compromised, and be potentially linked with the neurodegenerative disorders observed in certain EV71\u2010infected patients. On the other hand, the decrease in DNM1L will also limit its activity in the scission of the outer mitochondrial membrane, thus preventing caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis (Breckenridge et al., 2003). This notion is further supported by the downregulation of FKBP1A that modulates the activity of type 1 TGF\u2010\u03b2 receptor (Wang et al., 1994) as well as ryanodine receptor.

However, LDL is considered as an undesirable cholesterol, and APOB results in platelet activation (Relou et al., 2002). An increase in both processes may enhance the risk of atherosclerosis and eventually myocardial infarction (Qureshi et al., 2002). Indeed, enteroviruses have been detected in some patients with atherosclerosis (Kwon et al., 2004).

However, Chen et al. (2004) showed that the action of CLU is dependent on its two different isoforms, one nuclear, and the other secreted and cytoplasmic. Notably, overexpression of CLU is also observed in neurodegenerative diseases (Duguid et al., 1989), which is relevant to the CNS disease model of enterovirus infection.

CFL1 is a member of the CFL/actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) family, which regulates actin dynamics by increasing the rate of actin depolymerization and facilitating actin filament turnover (Chen et al., 2000). In neutrophils and neutrophil\u2010like cells, the dephosphorylation of CFL1 and its translocation to F\u2010actin\u2010rich regions, correlate with the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (Nagaishi et al., 1999). This is congruent with the downregulation of DNM1L, which leads to an increase in hydrogen peroxide level. In cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the rapid dephosphorylation of ADF and CFL1, which coassemble with actin to form rods that span the diameter of the neurite and disrupt the normal cytoskeleton (Minamide et al., 2000). Such persistent rods cause degeneration of the distal neurite without killing the neuron. These findings suggest a common pathway that can lead to loss of synapses, which mirrors the neurodegenerating disorder seen in some EV71\u2010infected patients. Dephosphorylated CFL1 binds to actin and translocates into mitochondria, and actin cytoskeletal changes may enhance mitochondrial translocation of pro\u2010apoptogenic proteins resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis (Chua et al., 2003). Thus, enhanced CFL1 level in EV71 infection and its dephosphorylation may lead to destruction of neuronal processes and the initiation of apoptosis in the late phase of infection, similar to poliovirus infection (Agol et al., 2000). It will be interesting to investigate the effect of silencing CFL1 on neuronal plasticity during EV71 infection, and whether the neuropathologic fate can be attenuated.",

The presence of this p53 isoform with a truncated C\u2010terminus is therefore expected to modify the activity of the wild\u2010type p53, and exert a role in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection.

This complex network is host\u2010specific as well as virus\u2010specific. The consequences of such modulation can contribute to the outcome of infection and to disease pathogenesis. For example, CPE (but not apoptosis) is the contributory factor for an inflammatory reaction, and the occurrence of inflammation will determine the clinical manifestation of the disease.

This strategy increased the mass of each protein that could be loaded onto the gel in order to bring the low abundance proteins into the dynamic range of detection, and also produced less crowded individual protein maps thus simplifying analysis and interpretation. The fractions were dialysed overnight against 30 mM Tris pH 8.5 and 7 M urea in mini\u2010dialysis tubes (Amersham). The dialysed samples were concentrated using the 2\u2010D clean up kit (Amersham). The proteins were then dissolved in rehydration buffer comprising 2% CHAPS, 2 M thiourea, 8 M urea and 0.5% IPG buffer. An equal amount of each protein fraction (\u223c250 \u00b5g) was loaded onto each 24\u2010cm Immobiline DryStrip with pH range 4\u20137 or 6\u20139 (Amersham). The strips were later focused on the Ettan IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Prior to second dimension separation, each IPG strip was equilibrated with 10 ml of SDS equilibration buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 6 M urea and 0.002% bromophenol blue. The SDS\u2010PAGE separation process was performed at 18\u00b0C, and then stained with the silver stain plus kit (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
