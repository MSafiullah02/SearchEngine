We speculate that the decision was based on an observation that patients presenting with comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and immunocompromising conditions, have higher COVID-19 mortality. 2 However, the correlation between polymorbidity and age is far from perfect, due to the heterogeneity of aging. 3 As this pandemic develops, emergency physicians must be familiar with a more global approach to the assessment of patients' physiologic resilience and chance of benefit with intensive care. This approach may seem more philosophical than practical in this crisis, but it can be an efficient tool to guide equitable resource allocation. This may put us closer to \"getting it right\" with medical care that makes a difference and maximizes benefit. 4 Faced with fewer ICU beds per capita, physicians in the United Kingdom (UK) have been challenged with the same difficult resource allocation decisions as Italy. The proposed method of triage published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom takes a slightly different approach. Instead of making decisions based on chronological age, the NICE COVID-19 Rapid Guideline:",

While frailty is often associated with older age, purely age-based criteria are frequently inaccurate, as younger people can also present with frailty, and many older people are healthy and robust. 7 Assessing frailty is already an unconscious part of an emergency physician's assessment of patients, but can be done in a more structured and evidence-based way.",

Strategies for identifying frailty are often based on a balance between efficacy and feasibility in a specific setting. The COVID-19 guideline presented by NICE proposes the use of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). 8 The CFS, developed by Canadian geriatrician Kenneth Rockwood, is a simple one-page \"frailty cheat sheet,\" which provides nine pictograms and brief descriptions to place patients on a scale from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill). Patient placement on this scale is based on evaluation by an experienced clinician using a summary assessment of health and recent function to estimate their level of frailty or robustness. This tool has been validated and successfully used in multiple settings, including those where more extensive testing is not feasible. 9 It is a rapid and ED-friendly method already used in every National Health Service (NHS) ED in the United Kingdom, and seems practical to use in the context of COVID-19 patients presenting to an overwhelmed hospital (Figure 1 ).",

These are hard decisions, which sometimes have been deferred to \"others\" (internists, intensivists, palliative care) but may soon be an ED decision as the demand on limited health care resources increases. Considering the Canadian context lacks the UK's NHS \"4-hour standard\" for admission decision, it can be assumed that many of the clinical decision points described in the NICE pathway may occur while under the care of emergency physicians.",

Research should prioritize studying outcomes of older patients and frail patients with COVID-19 to better characterize these populations and inform decision-making. In these uncertain times, we need to realize that it is likely not age, but rather frailty, that best contributes to outcome prediction. After all, the more encouraging interpretation of the",

Avoid basing treatment on evidence from studies of patients who are not like this patient. (3) Discuss goals of care.
