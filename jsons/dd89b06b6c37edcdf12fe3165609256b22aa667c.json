Fit testing is a crucial component of healthcare worker safety and should be conducted at least annually for each type of respirator that a user wears. During the COVID-19 pandemic, fit testing was ramped up at many centers to expand the healthcare workforce capable of safely providing care to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The NIOSH standard requires 95% of particles challenging the mask, roughly sized between 10 and 300 nm, be prevented from passing through. the hospital.

FFRs were mounted across a small duct through which NaCl aerosols flowed. Sizeresolved measurements of aerosol electrical mobility diameter and condensation mediated particle counts upstream and downstream of the FFR were used to determine aerosol penetration, the complement of mask filtration efficiency. Our protocol deviates in several ways from the NIOSH standard, which requires pre-conditioning masks for 24 hours and challenging masks until they reach a particle loading of 200 mg.

Due to the need to scale treatment for up to 3,000 N95 respirators per day, we explored the possibility of using the dry cycle of industrial instrument washers available at UMHS for decontamination. The dry cycle essentially simulates an oven with forced air convection. The temperature range of these washers is 82 -93 o C with a 30-minute cycle time. When the temperature is set to 82 o C for 30 minutes, there are approximately 10 minutes of warm up in the 30-minute cycle, resulting in 20 minutes at 82 o C (Supplement eFigure 2). Humidity in the washer was varied to achieve three levels of relative humidity (RH = dry, low, or moderate) and was measured in one of two ways. A Fisherbrand Certified Traceable Digital Hygrometer/Thermometer (Basic Model 11-661-7A) was used to measure RH under baseline conditions (dry, operating the instrument washer without modification), and with moisture added (low RH, seven 43 cm x 66 cm surgical towels receiving 700 mL deionized water). As it was difficult to increase the RH greater than 8-10% (Supplement eFigure 2), we used a method that allows for temperature monitoring and humidity control coupled with mask isolation, as developed by Anderegg et al (11) . This method achieves moderate RH using Ziploc medium square (rigid) polypropylene sealed containers. Multiple individual containers were placed in the oven, including two containers that contained temperature and humidity sensors (SEK-SCC30-DB-Sensor) to log the environmental conditions over the course of a cycle (Supplement eFigure 3). These sensors were mounted through the lids of the containers with a wired connection that extended out the gasketed washer door to a data acquisition computer (SEK-Sensorbridge). For our experiments, we added ~300 \u00b5L deionized water to a 7.5 x 7.5 cm 2 paper towel before placing the sealing lids on the containers. For moderate RH heat experiments, containers with sensors and a mask represented the conditions within all sealed Ziploc containers in the instrument washer, and were present along-side containers containing skeleton masks to which experimental coupons were attached (described below).",

            "text": "Biological Indicators. We used a total of four model viruses (Table 1) , three bacteria, and one fungus to study N95 respirator decontamination methods. The viruses included +ssRNA bacteriophage MS2 and dsRNA bacteriophage Phi6 for several reasons, including: they are common human virus indicators in the literature (14, 15) ; they can be produced at high concentrations that allow for large experimental dynamic ranges; they have rapid turn-around times for culture-based enumeration (12-18 hours), and; they do not require BLS2 or BSL3 facilities. We also employed a recombinant Influenza H3N2 strain because, like SARS-CoV-2, it is an enveloped ssRNA virus that is transmitted via large respiratory droplets, and perhaps small particle aerosols (16) . It has surface proteins that are required for infectivity, and influenza viruses were used in previous studies on FFR decontamination (3, 17) . The recombinant H3N2 viruses used in this study make firefly luciferase in infected cells, which provides a rapid read-out for infectivity after only 16-18 hours. We also conducted select experiments with the mouse coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV). This virus is in the same genus as SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore expected to behave similarly to it outside of the host. The reason we conducted limited experiments with this virus was due to the limited dynamic range of the assay (1-2 log10), and because results took approximately 48 hours to obtain after the completion of experiments. For bacterial inactivation experiments, we used Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), and Geobacillus stereothermophilus (ATCC 12980) in different combinations across treatment experiments. E. coli was selected to represent a typical Gram-negative hospital pathogen. S. aureus is Gram positive and was selected because of its importance as an invasive hospital pathogen that spreads clonally from patient to patient in the hospital, often via the hands of healthcare workers. G. stearothermophilus is a thermophilic spore former used to represent infectious agents such as Clostridium difficile. Finally, Aspergillus niger (a patient isolate) was used to evaluate selected decontamination treatments for fungus inactivation. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Respirator performance is reported in terms of filtration efficiency and pressure drop measured across the mask at the test flow rate.

We originally tested a Sterrad HPGP system and observed strong virus inactivation (Supplement eFigure 8). Phi6 and influenza virus inactivation exceeded the assay dynamic range following treatment, corresponding to >7.9 and >3.8 log10 inactivation, respectively. MS2 was inactivated by an average of 5.6 log10. Unfortunately, this system was not scalable to the level necessary for UMHS and mask integrity decreased after just 3 treatments (Table 2) . We therefore tested the Bioquell VHP decontamination system under two different conditions (Condition 1-short exposure, and Condition 2-the FDA EUA-approved protocol with long exposure) with all four viruses, including MHV. For Condition 1, we observed >2 log10 inactivation for all four viruses (Figure 2 ). For Condition 2, MS2 and Phi6 were inactivated at >2 log10, and MHV showed >1.1 log10 inactivation. The results with the VHP treatment highlight that the composition of the deposited virus solution impacts virus inactivation (discussed below).",

This effect was more pronounced for Phi6 inactivation than MS2 inactivation. The average inactivation of Phi6 deposited in PBS was 3.6 log10, and only 0.45 log10 for Phi6 deposited in DMEM solution. These observations were based on duplicate sample results; additional experiments need to be conducted to characterize the statistical differences between applications with PBS and DMEM. Experiments with moderate RH heat treatment alone with viruses deposited in both PBS and DMEM were inconclusive because in all samples, regardless of the application medium, the viruses were fully inactivated to the assay detection limits (Supplement eFigure 7). Follow up experiments with low RH (10%) and 82 o C heat alone conducted in controlled lab experiments emphasize the large impact that media has on heat inactivation (Supplement eFigure 10).

In our sequential UV-PX and heat treatments, most of the observed virus inactivation was achieved by the heat with moderate relative humidity alone, and less than 2 log10 was achieved for any virus with the UV-PX treatment alone. Previous work assessing influenza virus removal through moist (85% RH) heat treatment at 65 \uf0b0C for 30 minutes with viruses applied in a mucin medium demonstrated inactivation to greater than 3 log10 (17) .

Although both Geobacillus and E. coli showed complete inactivation, S. aureus inactivation was not complete and colonies were always detected on the decontamination coupons. Notably, there is no standard for S. aureus inactivation with VHP treatment systems, even though it is known to be catalase-positive and it known to be resistant to VHP treatment (22, 23) . Our results suggest that S. aureus persistence under VHP may extend to soft fomite surfaces, such as the FFR material evaluated in this study.

Through this study, we learned that experimental protocols can significantly influence results; specifically, our results demonstrate the impact that virus application medium has on the effectiveness of N95 FFR decontamination. This has practical implications. The FDA EUA recommends treatments achieve >3 log10 removal of viruses, but does not give guidance on the application media used to deposit viruses on the masks. The outcomes of this study suggest that >3 log10 for a specific virus could depend on the deposition solution. With VHP, for example, the MS2 removal in DMEM was greater than 3 log10 under two different treatment conditions, but the MS2 removal in PBS was less than 2 log10 under the same conditions. Viruses propagated in tissue cultures are often deposited in the media used for their propagation (e.g., DMEM), which may result in elevated inactivation for heat and VHP. For example, a recently reported non-peer reviewed study (24) conducted with SARS-CoV-2 suggests that 3 log10 removal is possible at 70 o C dry heat after 60 minutes; however, the application medium was not defined. If the SARS-CoV-2 was deposited in culture medium and our observed pattern holds, then the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation observed may not be achieved for the virus applied in other media. In contrast to what we observed with heat and VHP, the UV experiments showed that virus deposition in DMEM resulted in less inactivation. This may be due to shielding from constituents present in the complex DMEM solution as compared to PBS (Supplement eTables 4 and 5). Ongoing research should better define the impact of the deposition media constituents on evaluation of decontamination processes, and identify appropriate media conditions that generate conservative estimates of inactivation relative to what occurs in humanderived virus carrier fluids.",

We could demonstrate at most 1-2 log10 inactivation, although we are currently working to increase the dynamic range of the MHV assays to 3 log10. The influenza virus experiments had a larger dynamic range, up to 3 to 4 log10. The bacteriophage surrogates add additional value to our experiments as they had much higher dynamic ranges, usually >7 log10 inactivation and experiments could be carried out quickly and without BSL2 facilities. The combination of four viruses used in this study provides a richer dataset compared to most studies. Influenza virus and MHV are similar in structure to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore provide critical information on how SARS-CoV-2 might behave in the decontamination processes. The two bacteriophages allowed us to quickly develop experimental protocols, probe the impacts of solution composition, and understand the extent of virus inactivation beyond 1-4 log10 and for viruses with a range of structures. We are confident that decontamination processes that effectively remove these four viruses will effectively remove SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, compared to studies that analyze one type of virus in a single medium, these results with a diverse set of viruses in two different media are valuable for evaluation of other viruses of interest in healthcare settings and for potential future pandemic scenarios.",

Our results suggest that either moist heat (82 o C + 62-66% RH) or VHP can address the hospital's needs; however, each approach has notable limitations. Moist heat was very effective at eradicating all tested viruses and S. aureus, but did not eliminate spore-forming bacteria. Nevertheless, it remains a viable option for decontamination, when coupled with strategic infection control practices (e.g. no reprocessing FFRs that used while caring for C. difficile patients). However, a humidified oven is required to reliably achieve the necessary relative humidity to enhance pathogen inactivation. Hydrogen peroxide was effective at inactivating viruses (particularly influenza) beyond 2 log10 and often 3 log10. However, a notable limitation was our inability to eradicate S. auerus. While persistence of S. aureus on a reprocessed N95 might impose only limited risk to the wearer, it can serve as a hospital reservoir for this pathogen and facilitate spread to patients.

Better information is needed to understand the characteristics of the carrier matrix that carries the SARS-CoV-2 in a range of environments, and this information needs to be translated into experimental protocols. In addition, while the focus with regards to pathogen eradication needs to be on SARS CoV-2, other pathogens that spread in the hospital and cause significant morbidity should also be considered.
