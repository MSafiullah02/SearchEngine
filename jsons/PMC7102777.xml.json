The importance of immediate collection of reliable epidemiological information, appropriate analysis, and rapid dissemination to relevant stakeholders during an outbreak, is well-recognised in terms of the public health response and containment of the outbreak [2], [3]. Information on the causative agent, likely routes of transmission and prediction of how the outbreak might spread, diagnostic criteria, and possible treatments are all relevant. Such information allows public health experts in both national and international agencies and in research settings to formulate and implement prevention policies and strategies based on updated evidence. Dissemination of public health information can be achieved by a number of methods such as online, specialised peer reviewed papers or, for example, on the World Health Organization (WHO) website [4]. However, the primary method for communicating research findings is through the medium of journal articles [5].",

It was first observed in a 60-year old man with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure, who died in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 2012 [8]. The first human cluster of eleven cases was confirmed retrospectively in a public hospital in Jordan in April 2012 [9]. To date, WHO has been notified of 1800 laboratory-confirmed cases from 27 countries, and of 640 deaths [10]. Most outbreaks have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, in particular in Saudi Arabia, with occasional spread to other countries, including an outbreak in Korea in 2015 [6]. There have been numerous outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, for example 25 cases in Al-Hasa between April 1st and May 23rd 2013 [11], 255 patients in Jeddah between January 1st and May 16th, 2014 [12], [13], 45 patients between March 29th and May 21st, 2014 in King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, between March and April 2014 [14], [15], and 130 MERS cases at King Abulaziz Medical City in Riyadh in June\u2013August 2015 [16].",

A similar analysis of two outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) showed that most articles were published after the outbreaks had ended, even though they had direct public health relevance during the outbreaks [5]. Our analysis included the epidemiology categories and research domains in which journal articles on the four MERS-CoV outbreaks were published; the methodological characteristics of studies in terms of type, design, case definition, and setting; the timeline of publication of studies in relation to the time of the outbreak; and the scientific impact of MER-CoV articles, in terms of level of citations compared to simultaneously published control articles.",

These dates were (1) April 1st and May 23rd 2013 for the Al-Hasa outbreak, (2) January 1st and May 16th, 2014 for the Jeddah outbreak, (3) March 29th and May 21st, 2014 for the Riyadh 2014 outbreak and (4) June\u2013September 28th 2015 for the Riyadh 2015 outbreak [11], [12], [13], [16]. The literature search was carried out in September 2016. Separate searches were carried out for each outbreak.

Submission and acceptance dates were derived from the journals or MEDLINE records, while publication date was taken as when the article was first became available in full text format; when both a print and an online publication dates were available, the publication date was taken as the earlier of the two. If only a publication month was available, the date was assumed to be the 15th of the month. Number of citations for an article on a particular outbreak was based on the Web of Science (Thomas Reuters) record on 7th September 2016 (https://apps.webofknowledge.com/). The impact factor of the journal in which each retained article was published was noted from the Journal of Citation Reports database for 2015 (Thomas Reuters). The impact factors for articles published within one year of the relevant outbreak were compared to the impact factors for articles published thereafter. To provide a control sample of articles, the submission-to-acceptance and acceptance-to-publication sequences and the citation number within six months and thereafter was also recorded for two articles within the same journal issue as each MERS-CoV article being analysed. This would allow us to determine if the MERS-CoV articles were cited more frequently than articles on other subjects published in the same journal issues. In each case, we selected control articles that either immediately preceded or immediately followed the relevant MERS-CoV article. The selection depended on the pagination in the particular journal issue. For example, if the MERS-CoV article was the first article in an issue, we chose the two following articles (of the same type) as the controls, but if it was the last article we picked the two preceding articles (of the same type) as controls. If the MERS-CoV article was somewhere in the middle, we picked the article immediately before and the article immediately after as controls.",

For the Web of Science searches, there were 399 articles for Al-Hasa, 302 for Jeddah and 299 for Riyadh. There was substantial overlap with the MEDLINE results. Fig. 1\nshows a flow diagram for selection of the final 68 unique articles after exclusion criteria were applied and articles were combined from MEDLINE and Web of Science searches [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79].

The final result, when these sixteen articles were distributed, was that the Al-Hasa outbreak featured in 32 articles, either alone or in combination with other outbreaks, the Jeddah outbreak in 28 articles, the Riyadh 2014 outbreak in 25 articles and the Riyadh 2015 outbreak in nine articles (Table 1, Table 2).",

The articles focused for example on prevention and control guidelines, including travel advice for Hajj pilgrims. In the same period, the Bulletin of the World Health Organization included six MERS-CoV articles, including Public Health Round-ups, and article on pilgrims returning from Hajj, and an article on steps that should be taken regarding surveillance, awareness raising and diagnostic testing capacity, but none specific to any of the outbreaks in this review.

The majority of recruitment occurred in hospitals/primary healthcare centres (76.5%), the community (7.4%), laboratory (5.9%) or college (1.5%), with 8.8% not specified/applicable. In most cases, data was used that was initially collected for other purposes, in particular hospital, medical or exposure records (58.8%; including three where biological specimens were also collected and one where interviews were also performed) or secondary data re-analysis from other studies (5.9%), while the remainder was from biological specimen collection (16.2%), questionnaires (8.8%), sequence data (5.9%; including two where biological specimens were also collected), or was not specified (4.4%). In most studies, MERS-CoV was confirmed by means of PCR (75%), as recommended by the CDC and WHO, sometimes in combination with clinical signs and once with western blotting (Supplementary Appendix 1). Presence of anti-MERS-CoV protein antibodies was included in three studies (4.4%). Nine studies (13.2%) included awareness, emotional responses or guidelines arising from an outbreak, and in five studies it was not specified (7.4%) (Supplementary Appendix 1).

However, there are developments in the medical and scientific publishing industry that may help in expediting the process of article publication in future emerging infectious diseases. It is important to minimise the delay between generating and publishing research, by streamlining peer-review process, and targeting specific research audiences. It is also important to offer fast-track and rapid publication options, particularly to advanced online publication. Publication costs and fees can be a barrier to researchers, particularly in developing countries. For epidemiology research, standardization of protocols and questionnaires, and greater accessibility of real-time online information systems, would be of assistance to researchers for rapid collection, analysis and dissemination of research. The need for better data management was identified as an issue in the recent Ebola outbreak [82]. An example of this need is in terms of improved data harmonization and access to application tools. Standardization of protocols would assist in timely production of epidemiological studies. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has published a comprehensive handbook on methods and applications in monitoring of data quality and evaluation of surveillance systems [83], [84].",

However, human-to-human transmission occur usually in healthcare -associated outbreaks such as those included in the current review, and other outbreaks from other countries in the Middle East, and the Republic of Korea [11], [12], [13], [14], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. The healthcare associated outbreaks were linked to poor compliance with infection prevention and control procedures [53], [64], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91]. Effectiveness of consistent promotion and application of basic and advanced infection control procedures in reduction of cases has been demonstrated in hospital-associated MERS-CoV outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Korea [53], [85], [91]. However, MERS-CoV has a high morbidity and case-fatality rate, particularly among ICU and/or critically ill patients, those with comorbid illness, older patients and those with a high viral load [11], [12], [15], [92], [93], [94]. The potential for viral mutations, for example in the viral spike (S) protein, which mediates viral entry into host cells, or in viral proteases such as Mpro, could increase viral affinity for human host cells and expand host cell range [50], [94], [95], [96]. Thus, surveillance, contact tracing and research into possible animal hosts and transmission pathways to humans need to be prioritized [37]. This is vital to fill in gaps in knowledge and understanding of MERS-CoV. Such gaps include exposure to infected dromedary camels, direction of transmission between humans and camels, the role of a third link in the chain of cross-species transmission, such as bats, and the reasons behind limited human-to-human transmission [97]. There is no specific therapy for MERS-CoV, despite promising results in animal studies for few antiviral synthetic peptides and candidate vaccines. GLS-5300, a DNA-plasmid vaccine encoding MERS-CoV S protein (Inovio, GeneOne Life Science Inc. and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) is the first potential MERS-CoV vaccine to enter human testing [98], however it is intended for prophylactic use, rather than in outbreak situations. In terms of diagnosis, MERS-CoV was confirmed by PCR. This is expected, as real-time PCR is the major method for detection of MERS-CoV [99]. Antibody-based methods are not widely used as yet, although there is some interest in developing and implementing such methods in routine testing, especially to test for possible previous infection or if symptoms arose more than fourteen days previously as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [99], [100].",
