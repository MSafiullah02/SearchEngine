To date, over 30 AEFI case definitions have been developed by voluntary Brighton working groups, endorsed by normative bodies such as the Council of International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) [6] , the U.S., Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [7] , and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [8] and are freely available for public use at www.brightoncollaboration.org. These Brighton AEFI case definitions are increasingly being used and recognized as \"common currency\", allowing greater ease in comparing vaccine safety studies.

A need for a forum to discuss concerns, and how best to communicate the risks and benefits of the new approach to general public was identified and WHO was requested to take a lead on it. 8) Assessing vectored vaccine effects on innate immunity and on the possible induction of an immuno-suppressive window or alternatively immune activation. 9) Defining the length of time for monitoring AEFIs after receipt of vectored vaccines. 10) Developing guidelines for archiving samples of vectored vaccine samples to enable potential future testing to assess inadvertent contamination by adventitious agents. While vaccine safety issues are frequently most prominent in the post-licensure setting when administered to larger and heterogeneous populations, they should be viewed as a continuum with a product life cycle that begins pre-licensure [12] [13] [14] . Consistent with this, each Brighton Collaboration case definition is designed for use in pre-and post-licensure setting, and are associated with guidelines for collection, analysis and presentation of vaccine safety data in pre-and post-licensure clinical studies [15] , including a template protocol [16] .",

Some veterinary viral vector vaccines have been licensed [24] but there is as yet limited clinical experience of the efficacy and safety of such vectors in humans. A 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) informal consultation on the characterization and quality aspects of vaccines based on live viral vectors [27] and the EMA's guideline on quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of live recombinant viral vectored vaccines [28] identified several issues of critical importance which warrant further investigation.

This tool aimed at flagging issues that may either be showstoppers or need to be carefully addressed, helping to prioritize vector development activities. The template gathers information on the characteristics of the wild type virus from which the vector was derived; it also aids in the ascertainment of known effects of the proposed vaccine vector in animals and humans, manufacturing details, toxicology and potency, pre-clinical studies, and human use with an overall adverse effect and risk assessment.

We recognize that while desirable, the information needed to complete the entire template, especially from peer reviewed scientific publications or systematic reviews, may currently be unavailable for a new candidate vector vaccine. Nevertheless, the existence of such gaps in current knowledge should not deter researchers from initiating completion of the template to the best of their ability; any gaps may provide a constructive signal for prioritizing areas of future research. We also recognize that some researchers and sponsors may wish to delay sharing some information for proprietary or intellectual property reasons. Hopefully, such a stance will evolve as the development of a viral vector vaccine candidate \"matures\" from evaluation in human trials and the need for information sharing and transparency grows to maximize public acceptance. Furthermore, it is likely that the pace of accumulation of new scientific knowledge during vaccine development may be more rapid than changes in clinical diagnosis relevant to AEFI case definitions. Therefore, the Brighton Collaboration V3SWG hopes to maintain these templates in a dynamic \"wiki\" style (i.e., online collaborative editing) with the help of each vector vaccine research \"community.\" We seek your assistance to identify and encourage researchers of new viral vector vaccine candidates to complete a template and join in the subsequent vector-specific wiki community in this exciting new era of vaccine development during this as well as in future decades [36] .",
