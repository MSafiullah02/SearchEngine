Human-to-human spread has been documented (Assiri et al., 2013b).

However, since these antibodies react with a single epitope on the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and since coronaviruses are prone to mutate, this approach has raised concerns about possible antibody escape (Corti et al., 2015, Sabir et al., 2016).",

Passive immunotherapy with sera from these animals significantly reduced virus loads and accelerated virus clearance from the lungs of MERS-CoV infected mice (Zhao et al., 2015). This provides proof of concept that immune animal sera are potentially useful in the treatment of patients with MERS (Hayden et al., 2014). Passive immunotherapy with animal sera or antibodies has been successfully used to prevent rabies and to neutralize snake venom (Both et al., 2012, Gutierrez et al., 2014). Convalescent plasma used to treat patients with SARS has been found safe and has demonstrated some efficacy in a study with a small number of patients (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015). However, neutralizing antibody titers in MERS patients are generally low and the limited number of MERS survivors makes this approach impractical (Drosten et al., 2013).",

RBD contains the major neutralizing epitopes of the S protein, as shown by the observation that absorption of SARS patient convalescent sera with SARS-CoV RBD removes the majority of neutralizing antibodies (He et al., 2005). Independent research groups have also shown more directly that the MERS-CoV RBD sequence contains the major antigenic determinants for inducing neutralizing antibodies, and that neutralizing epitopes within MERS-CoV S1 are also localized primarily in the RBD region (Du et al., 2013, Mou et al., 2013). Here, we have demonstrated that anti-RBD antibodies function as major components of neutralizing antibodies. We found that RBD-specific IgG neutralized MERS-CoV infection with half maximal inhibitory concentration of 15.74 \u03bcg/mL, and 2.612 \u00d7 103 \u03bcg/mL for flowthroughs (Fig. 2\n), suggesting that the RBD of S protein act as an important neutralization determinant of MERS-CoV.

We did not observe any difference in body weight loss and pathologic changes on the exterior surface of the lungs in treated and untreated mice after infeciton, since in this model, mice only develope mild lung disease. Rapid virus replication and inflammatory cell infiltration in the infected lungs are the major parameters to measure (Zhao et al., 2014). Since the half-life of F(ab\u2019)2\nin vivo is relatively short and MERS-CoV is cleared within 6 days in this model (Zhao et al., 2014), we did not inject F(ab\u2019)2 antibodies before day \u22121 or after day 1 p.i.",

            "text": "To date, there are several anti-MERS-CoV antibodies developed from different origins. Each antibody contains its own advantages and disadvantages. For monoclonal antibodies, mouse-derived monoclonal antibody needs to be humanized before human use (Li et al., 2015); a human neutralizing antibody derived from a convalescent MERS patient can be produced in large amount from CHO cells (Corti et al., 2015). However, the single clone antibody raises the concern of viral escape mutant when applied to human. Administration of transchromosomic bovine human immunoglobulins (Luke et al., 2016) or dromedary immune serum (Zhao et al., 2015) resulted in rapidly viral clearance in infected mouse lungs. The disadvantage of these antibodies is that these animals are not readily available. Compared to the antibodies described above, the administration of equine IgG-derived F(ab\u2019)2 fragment proved to be a versatile and feasible method (Lu et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2007). It provides a useful platform to produce therapeutics against emerging infectious diseases.",

Therefore, horses immunized with MERS-CoV VLPs can serve as a useful initial source for developing protective F(ab\u2019)2 fragments, for the purpose of preparedness and to serve as a strategic reserve for a potential MERS epidemic and other emergent pathogens.",
