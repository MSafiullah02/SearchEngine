Biscardi et al.7 have demonstrated that the recurrence rate of asthma is higher in atopic children aged 2-15 years whose first attack was accompanied by M. pneumoniae infection, compared with those without. This observation suggests that M. pneumoniae infection is related to asthma attacks. Further studies analyzing the expression of various cytokines are needed to understand the relationship between M. pneumoniae infection and asthma.",

VEGF is secreted from endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells as well as inflammatory cells upon inflammatory reactions. It induces angiogenesis, permeability changes, and edema formation in the airway wall; all of these play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of asthma. Hypersecretion of VEGF in the airways induces T cell sensitization to inhalant allergens and stimulates the synthesis of co-stimulatory molecules in lung-resident dendritic cells.8 A previous study has indicated that serum VEGF levels are significantly higher in M. pneumoniae infected-patients with wheezing than in those without wheezing.9",

Eosinophils accumulate in the lungs of transgenic mice that overexpress IL-5.10,11 Moreover, IL-5 plays a role in the development of asthma. Choi et al.12 have demonstrated that serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 are significantly higher in atopic patients with wheezing than in those without or in control subjects. IL-13, which plays a role in airway remodeling, induces tissue fibrosis through transforming growth factor-\u03b2 activation.13 In addition, IL-13 has been shown to induce myofibroblast hyperplasia, airway obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness.9 In in vitro experiments, Thavagnanam et al.14 showed that IL-13 enhances goblet cell hyperplasia and decreases the number of bronchial epithelial cells detected in samples taken from children, suggesting an IL-13-mediated mechanism for the development of asthma. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 is released by Th1 cells and suppresses Th2 cells, thus maintaining the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells. Stirling and Chung15 have advocated that serum IFN-\u03b3 levels are decreased in atopic patients and that there is a significant relationship between the decrease in IFN-\u03b3 and the severity of asthma. Lack et al.16 reported that IL-5 levels and the number of eosinophils are both decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after intrathecal administration of IFN-\u03b3. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 increases airway responsiveness and promotes the synthesis of various cytokines such as regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor, which in turn initiate chronic airway inflammation.15",

Our findings, which included atopic children with and without wheezing, are consistent with those of previous studies that included children with wheezing.9,12 It has been suggested that compared with allergy, M. pneumoniae can more frequently aggravate or initiate asthma symptoms, and that M. pneumoniae pneumonia and asthma are significantly correlated in terms of clinical symptoms.17,18 It has also been shown that allergic reactions are induced or aggravated by IgE-related hypersensitivity and Th2 immune reactions.19-21\nM. pneumoniae induces upper airway infections such as acute pharyngitis and laryngitis more frequently than lower airway infections.22 Clyde23 reported that 20% of patients with M. pneumoniae infection were asymptomatic, and that less than 5% of all patients with M. pneumoniae infection had lower airway infections such as pneumonia. Based on these results, it is conceivable that M. pneumoniae infection may stimulate or aggravate allergic reactions.",

VEGF, an endothelial cell-specific mitogenic peptide, serves as a vascular permeability factor and plays a crucial role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It also induces extravasation of protein-rich plasma from the airway, increases vascular permeability, and causes airway inflammation through edema formation.24,25 Increased VEGF levels with M. pneumoniae infection suggest that M. pneumoniae stimulates allergic inflammation, as well as airway vascular angiogenesis and edema formation, consequently aggravating airway inflammation. In previous studies, the levels of IL-13, IL-4, and TNF-\u03b1 were increased with M. pneumoniae infection, suggesting that this infection can aggravate asthma symptoms.26,27 However, in our study, there were no significant differences in serum IL-13 and TNF-\u03b1 levels between admission phase and symptomatic recovery phase in any of the four study groups. This apparent discrepancy may be attributable to differences between the two study cohorts.",
