Emerging data suggest that it is associated with relatively higher mortality among elderly, with rates varying from 3.6 % to 14.8 % for the elderly population. This fact has also being highlighted in the media and in general elderly are advised to take more precautions. All this is leading to a scare among the elderly, about the eminent death. Many elderly are dependent on others for their day to day activities and the requird social distancing has made them feel more isolated, especially those who are not very technology driven. The global recommendation for the older population is isolation from society, staying at home for \"a very long time\" (BBC, 2020). Social isolation is a \"serious public health concern\" and is known to be increase the risk of adverse mental health outcomes (Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana, 2015) . Available data suggest that social disconnectedness puts the older people at a greater risk of depression and anxiety (Santini et al., 2020; Kavoor, 2020; Rajkumar, 2020) .",

Case-1 72 years old man, was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder since 20 years; hypertension and diabetes mellitus since last 5 years and was maintaining well on Escitalopram 15 mg/day, Telmisartan 40 mg/ day and Metformin 500 mg BD. He presented to emergency with symptom of 3 weeks duration, characterized by extreme anxiety, restless, fidgety, sleep disturbances and worries that every family member including he will die due to COVID-19 infection. These symptoms increased further after the lockdown. Symptoms would worsen on following the news channels, especially seeing the images of hospitals and pictures of sick people; and reading news about COVID-19. Started remaining preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19, distanced himself from others, would pressurize family members to buy masks and started hoarding them. He would consider himself vulnerable for infection and resultant death. Despite being reassured by family members that they are taking precautions and he is safe, he would not feel reassured. He would not allow any family member to go out of the house with the fear that he/she might get infected, bring infection to home, and he will get infected by the same, and ultimately die. Over the period of next 2 weeks developed syndromal depression, which led to emergency visit. His mental status examination revealed that he had excessive worry of getting infected with COVID-19, spreading the infection to others and hence would be blamed by the society, had ideas of worthlessness, catastrophe, and helplessness. Additionally he had sadness of mood. His routine investigations and physical examination did not reveal any abnormality. Tab. Escitalopram was increased to 20 mg/day along with prescription of Tab clonazepam 0.25 mg thrice a day. Supportive psychotherapy sessions were started and he is being followed up. Over the period of next 1 week he started showing improvement in symptoms.",

Exploration of history revealed that she has been living alone and was maintaining well without any antidepressants. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19 infection, she started following the news of COVID-19, and started remaining worried about contracting COVID-19 infection. As she was living alone, started remaining worried that there is no one to take care of her, if she develops COVID. In view of apprehension of developing COVID-19 infection, initially, her selfcare increased, she started washing clothes repeatedly, bathing frequently and frequently changing bed sheets. She would do so, as she would feel that these are contaminated and she would get infected with COVID-19 infection. Gradually, over the next 3 weeks, her anxiety related to COVID-19 infection increased, and she developed depressive symptoms in the form of sadness of mood, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disturbances, decreased appetite, self absorbed behavior, poor interaction, fearfulness, and delusion of persecution. She was brought to emergency in view of depressive and psychotic symptoms. She was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe depression with psychotic symptoms. She was started on Tab escitalopram 10 mg/day and Tab olanzapine 5 mg/day and is being followed up regularly.",
