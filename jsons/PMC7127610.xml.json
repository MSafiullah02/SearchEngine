However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was newly identified in 2002 to 2003, causing 10\u201350% mortality in infected individuals, affecting 27 countries, and exhibiting atypical pneumonia.1, 2 A novel coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first isolated and reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The symptoms of MERS-CoV include acute pneumonia and severe renal failure in humans after infection.3 This disease continued to emerge and spread to approximately 30 countries4 and in May 2015, an outbreak of MERS occurred in the Korea via a traveler from the Middle East. Until the patient was diagnosed as infected with MERS-CoV, 29 secondary infections occurred by visiting different clinics, resulting in 186 confirmed cases.5\n",

These reports prompted us towards the development of safer escin derivatives with anti-CoV activities. Previous studies on structure\u2013activity relationship with escins suggested that acylation at C-21 and C-22 was necessary for the cytotoxic effects.16, 17, 18, 19, 20 The cytotoxicity can be enhanced with methylation at C-24 and a free hydroxyl at C-16 at oleanane-type structure and altered by the site of glycosides.14, 21 Thus, alkaline and acid hydrolysis of escins was applied to detach acyl moieties at C-21 and C-22, and provide varieties of sugar moieties at C-3.",

The IR spectrum showed absorption due to hydroxyl (3375 cm\u22121), olefinic bond (1658 cm\u22121), and glycosidic linkage (1023 cm\u22121). The 1H and 13C NMR data of 2 proposed the structure as an olean-12-ene triterpenoid glucopyranosiduronic acid, exhibiting signals for seven tertiary methyl groups [\u03b4\nH 0.85 (CH3-25), 0.90 (CH3-26), 1.00 (CH3-24), 1.30 (CH3-23), 1.32 (CH3-29), 1.38 (CH3-30) and 1.88 (CH3-27)], an olefinic proton at \u03b4\nH 5.39 (br s) with two olefinic carbon signals at \u03b4\nC 123.0 (C-12) and 144.0 (C-13), and one \u03b2-d-glucopyranosiduronic acid moiety [one anomeric proton at \u03b4\nH 5.03 (H-1\u2032), along with five carbon signals at \u03b4\nC 107.2 (C-1\u2032), 78.2 (C-3\u2032), 77.7 (C-5\u2032), 75.5 (C-2\u2032) and 73.5 (C-4\u2032)] (Table 1\n).

These results indicated the attachment of \u03b2-d-glucopyranosiduronic acid to C-3 (\u03b4\nC 89.0).

The fraction after a two-step hydrolysis inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. The n-BuOH fractions above 5 \u03bcg/mL, which are expected to contain many escins, exhibited poor cell viability because of strong cytotoxic effects, even if it could show better PEDV inhibitory effects than the fraction from a two-step hydrolysis. Based on these data, the ten purified oleanane triterpenoids (1\u201310) were evaluated for their PEDV inhibitory effects with the same methods (Fig. S24). As compounds 8\u201310 showed strong cytotoxic effects on Vero cells at 20 \u03bcM, their PEDV inhibitory activities were evaluated at a concentration of 2 \u03bcM. Compounds 1\u20137 were tested at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM to compare their inhibitory effects on PEDV replication, providing less cytotoxicity in relatively high concentrations. Compound 4 showed the strongest inhibitory activity among the ten compounds 1\u201310. Additionally, Compounds 4\u20136 exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of PEDV replication at concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 \u03bcM, indicating improved cell viability from the two-step hydrolysis (Fig. S25). Based on cytotoxicity and CPE assays, structure-activity relationships (SARs) were studied. Isolated compounds 1\u201310 after the two-step hydrolysis suggested the presence of three important groups: (1) acylation at C-21, C-22 or C-28 (1\u20137 and 8\u201310), (2) methylation at C-24 (1\u20133 and 4\u20136), (3) existence of glycosidic linkages [(1\u20133) and (4 and 5\u20137)]. Group 1 (1\u20137 and 8\u201310) indicated that deacylation at C-21 could improve the cell viability (Figs.3A and S22). The PEDV inhibitory effects of group 2 (1\u20133 and 4\u20136) demonstrated that methylation at C-24 could reduce antiviral activity. Group 3 [(1\u20133) and (4 and 5\u20137)] showed that the absence of glycosidic linkage also improved the antiviral effects (Fig. S24).",

S22\u201324), the five compounds 1 and 4\u20137 were selected for further evaluation. The inhibitory effects of compounds 1 and 4\u20137 on nucleocapsid protein synthesis at 20 \u03bcM were measured using Western blot (Fig.4\nA).32 The five compounds showed moderate inhibitory effects on nucleocapsid protein synthesis, and compound 4 significantly inhibited nucleocapsid protein synthesis. Thus, compound 4 was further analyzed for its effects in nucleocapsid and spike protein synthesis with Western blot at concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 \u03bcM, and it was found to inhibit PEDV replication in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4B).",

Fig.5\nA shows the RNA expression levels of two kinds of proteins with compounds 4, 6 and positive control. When the inhibitory effect of compound 4 was analyzed in detail at the concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 \u03bcM, compound 4 inhibited the RNA expression of nucleocapsid and spike proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5B). On the basis of inhibition of PEDV RNA expression, compound 4 was further studied for its inhibitory effects on PEDV replication, by performing an immunocytochemistry assay (Fig.5C).34 We observed green fluorescence in virus-infected cells but no signals in mock-treated cells. This result revealed that compound 4 had noticeable inhibitory effects on PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 \u03bcM.",

As shown in Fig.5D, the hydroxyl group of C22 and C16 of 4 formed hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Glu166. Additionally, the methyl group of C23 and the B ring of 4 showed hydrophobic interactions with Cys145 and Leu27 through their side chains. The CDOCKER interaction energy was calculated to be \u221238.63 kcal/mol. The 3CLpro binding energy value of compound 4 was unstable and weaker than that of the reference ligand 0EM. However, clear key amino acid interactions of compound 4 with 3CLpro, proposed the mode of action as inhibition of 3CL protease and explained inhibitory possibility of the SARS-CoV of escin derivatives.",
