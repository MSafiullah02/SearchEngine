Over the last few years various strategies for developing single-use fabrics have evolved, using spunbonded-meltblown-spunbonded (SMS), spunlace hydroentangled, triplex or bicomponent fibrous webs, with or without chemical finishes to resist liquid penetration. Disposable SMS fabric can be formed by sandwiching an inner thermoplastic meltblown microfibrous web between two outer nonwoven webs of substantially continuous thermoplastic spunbonded filament, where the spunbond layer provides strength and dimensional stability while the meltblown layer provides the barrier property. The microfibrous nonwoven meltblown layers provide a barrier impervious to pathogens in the composite nonwoven fabric. However, various surgical procedures entail an extent of splashing, liquid strike-through, aerosol generation, or applied pressure, and can be of long duration. Care should therefore be taken in selecting single- or multiple-use gowns during specific procedures.",

SMS nonwovens showed better efficiency in preventing the transmission of S. aureus and E. coli in a saline solution, as compared to woven fabrics. Lankester et al. (2002) studied the extent of bacterial penetration through disposable gowns made of spun-bonded polyester and wood pulp, as compared to reusable woven polyester gowns; the results clearly showed a comparatively inferior barrier property for reusable woven polyester fabrics. Taken together, as a very generalized conclusion (McCullough and Schoenberger 1991), polypropylene-based gowns (for example, 97\u2013100% polypropylene, SMS laminates) provided the greatest protection against blood strike-through and microbial penetration. Gowns composed of a single layer of nonwoven fabric provided the next highest level of effectiveness. Reusable gowns composed of 100% woven cotton provided a minimal level of protection.",

            "text": "Mammalian embryos and some amphibians can spontaneously regenerate their tissues after severe injury. Adult mammals typically recover from such injuries by a \u2018repair\u2019 process, eventually developing scars. At the price of wound closure, severe wound contraction and scar tissue formation often cause serious clinical complications and life-long disfigurement for the survivor. During healing of skin wounds, a group of contractile cells (myofibroblasts) migrate in the wound bed. These cells express cytoplasmic bundles of microfilaments (stress fibres), using which they apply contractile forces to shrink the injured site. Eventually the wound site is filled by an irregular dense collagen fibrous matrix (Tomasek et al. 2002). When a nonwoven matrix is implanted within the wound bed, those contractile cells migrate randomly, following the randomly oriented fibrous architecture of the nonwoven matrix. This can result in disorientation of major axes of contractile cells and the disruption of organized cell contraction at the edges of the wound. Thus, randomization of individual force vectors of contractile cells will reduce rapid contraction of wound edges (Fig. 9.1\n). A significant reduction in the number of contractile cells has also been reported when the wound is treated with a nonwoven scaffold during dermis regeneration (Murphy et al. 1990). Despite detailed understanding of wound healing mechanisms, scar- less healing in adult humans still remains a utopian concept, but extensive research is ongoing to develop bioresponsive fibrous material, such as collagen-glycosaminoglycan bicomponent fibrous web, which will be able to inhibit scar formation and cause controlled contraction (Yannas 2013).",

Sodium hyaluronate salt is water-soluble, so sodium hyaluronate is esterified in order to impart water insolubility. Esterified hyaluronic acid fibres show easy processability and enhanced residence time in vivo. Esterified hyaluronic acid-based nonwovens (e.g., Hyaff-11, Fidia Advanced Biopolymers, Italy) have been extensively used for knee-joint cartilage tissue engineering (Moretti et al. 2005) and nose reconstruction (Farhadi et al. 2006). Statistically, chondrocytes produced a significantly higher amount of glycosaminoglycan and collagen in the nonwoven scaffold (Fig. 9.2\n) as compared to porogen-leached poly ethelene glycol terephthalate/poly butylene terephthalate (PEGT/PBT) scaffolds (Miot et al. 2006). Nonwoven porous polymer tubes fabricated from nonwoven meshes of polyglycolic acid fibres have been seeded with rat hepatocytes and the constructs successfully implanted in small intestinal submucosa (Kim and Mooney 1998).",

Such nonwoven scaffolds release calcium and silicate ions, and have potential for bone regeneration (Wakita et al. 2011). However, most nonwoven scaffolds reported so far have poor compressive strength and are hence unsuitable for bone tissue engineering. For the purpose of bone regeneration, attempts have been made to develop fibre-reinforced polymer foam. The reinforcing effect of fibres within a matrix becomes effective when fibres are uniformly distributed throughout the matrix, the degree of fibre-polymer contact is maximized and fibre\u2013fibre contact is kept at a minimum. Generally, this type of scaffold is made using a solvent-casting technique. Mandal et al. (2012) attempted to develop a silk-fibre-reinforced scaffold to simulate the compressive modulus of bone. Interfacial bonding between the silk fibre and the silk matrix resulted in an compressive modulus of 10 MPa in hydrated conditions. Such matrix stiffness and surface roughness support osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to prepare bone-like tissue (Mandal et al. 2012).",

This plasma is then returned to the patient\u2019s body. In such systems, oxygenated plasma flows through the fibre capillary, but hepatocytes are attached in extracapillary spaces. As a result, the oxygen supply to the hepatocytes is inadequate because the oxygen-binding ability of plasma is less than one-tenth of that of whole blood. This limited oxygen supply leads to insufficient function of hepatocytes.",
