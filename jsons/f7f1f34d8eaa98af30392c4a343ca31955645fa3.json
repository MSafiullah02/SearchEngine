            "text": "Coronaviruses are prone to emergence into new host species most recently evidenced by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2. We used reverse genetics to remodel the S and mACE2 binding interface resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry.

In addition, molecular modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and receptor interface revealed a loss of interaction between Q498 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and Q42 of mACE2 (Fig 1B-C) , which may diminish binding efficiency. Thus, we predicted the substitution of residue Q498, and adjacent P499, with those from WIV1 and SARS-CoV-1 would restore the interaction with Q42 of mACE2, while preserving interaction with hACE2 ( Fig. 1D-E) . Using reverse genetics, we engineered Q498T/P499Y into the SARS-CoV-2 S gene and recovered the recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA). Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated to similar levels as the parental WT virus in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1F ) and unlike WT virus, SARS-CoV-2 MA could infect cells expressing mACE2 (Fig. 1G ).",

Under identical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate in mice. Histological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 MA infected mice revealed inflammation of small conducting airways on 2dpi, associated with high levels of viral antigen staining (Fig. S3A ). Viral replication was limited to conducting airways and absent in interstitium, and is absent on 4dpi, concordant with clearance of viral titer (Fig. 2B, Fig. S3B ). Similar to that observed in humans, SARS-CoV-2 MA replication was also observed in the upper airway although the magnitude was less than that seen in the lung (Fig. 2C ). The loss of pulmonary function as measured by WBP is commonly observed in murine models of emerging CoV pathogenesis 6, 7 and is an important clinically relevant measure of disease. Using WBP, we evaluated several complementary metrics of pulmonary obstruction and bronchoconstriction including PenH and Rpef. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 MA young infected mice showed a small but significant change in PenH (Fig. 2D ) and a significant decrease in Rpef (Fig. 2E ) on 2dpi indicative of a decrease in lung function. Thus, like often seen in young adult humans, infection of young adult mice with SARS-CoV-2 MA resulted in efficient virus replication in the upper and lower airways, limited replication in the parenchyma and was associated with mild to moderate disease.",

Coupling predictive molecular modeling and reverse genetics 21 Although the SARS-CoV-2 MA RBD mutations may attenuate the function of select human monoclonal antibodies or vaccines in mice, this phenotype was not observed with mouse adapted strains of SARS-CoV-1 [29] [30] [31] . In any event, we demonstrate that our previously described hACE2 transgenic mouse model supports efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis in vivo, as well 5 . Consequently, this model offers an alternative replication and disease model that uses wildtype SARS-CoV-2, appropriate for evaluating therapeutic antibodies that bind the RBD and other countermeasures. In comparison to SARS-CoV-1 infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a mild bronchiolitis in young mice characterized by efficient virus growth, minimal weight loss and about 40% mortality, the latter phenotype associated with viral invasion of the CNS. In hACE2 transgenic mice, neuroinvasion is a common pathologic outcome following SARS-CoV infection and a major driver of mortality 5, 32 . Together, these data describe critical new animal models, demonstrate countermeasure potential and provide key recombinant viruses for further mouse adaptation, leading to 2 nd generation mouse models of human disease.",

Our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of IFN lambda-1a treatment in human COVID-19 infections. Zoonotic coronaviruses readily traffic into new host species, as evidenced by the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. COVID-19 infections have caused millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. As there are currently no approved vaccines and only one antiviral approved for emergency use for SARS-CoV-2 1 , small animal model systems are vital to better understand COVID-19 disease mechanisms and to evaluate medical counter measures (MCMs) for improved global health.

Pegylated interferon lambda-1 (peg-IFN-l1) is Phase 3-ready for hepatitis delta virus infection and has been proposed to treat COVID-19 patients 18 . We first sought to determine if peg-IFN-l1 would initiate an antiviral response capable of inhibiting productive infection of primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures by SARS-CoV-2. Pretreatment of HAE with peg-IFN-l1 provided a potent dose dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus production (Fig 4D). To determine if this in vitro antiviral effect would translate to in vivo efficacy, we performed prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy studies in BALB/c mice. We subcutaneously administered 2\u00b5g peg-IFN-l1 18hr prior or 12hr after infection with 10 5 PFU SARS-CoV-2 MA. Both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of peg-IFN-l1 significantly diminished SARS-CoV-2 MA replication in the lung(Fig. 4E). Peg-IFN-l1",

            "text": ", we altered the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) allowing viral entry via mACE2. Unlike parental wild-type (WT) virus, the resultant recombinant virus, SARS-CoV-2 MA, used mACE2 for infection in vitro. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both 10-week old young adult and 1-year aged BALB/c mice but disease was more severe in aged mice, reproducing the age-related increase in pathogenesis observed in humans. It is remarkable that improved lethal mouse models of SARS-CoV-1 also selected for mutations in key RBD interaction models in in vivo 22,23 . Importantly, we show the utility of the SARS-CoV-2 MA model for screening MCMs through vaccine challenge studies and the evaluation of a novel clinical candidate, pegylated interferon lambda-1. Peg-IFN-l1 is a Phase 3-ready drug in clinical development for hepatitis delta virus infection with a well-established safety and tolerability profile. It has been given to over 3000 patients in the context of 19 clinical trials as a weekly subcutaneous injection, often for 24-48 weeks to treat patients with chronic viral hepatitis 24,25 . For SARS-CoV-2, peg-IFN-l1 is a promising therapeutic for the treatment of COVID-19 infections 26 , blocks porcine coronavirus replication in gut cells in vitro 27 , and SARS-CoV-1 replication in human airway cells 28 . Our data, which demonstrates reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human cells and in mice, support further evaluation in primates and in humans. In fact, multiple investigator sponsored studies are underway to evaluate peg-IFN-l1 for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV infection (NCT04331899, NCT04343976, NCT04344600, NCT04354259). Thus, we provide a new SARS-CoV-2 animal model that captures multiple aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, providing a high-throughput in vivo system to evaluate MCMs and helping fill a critical unmet need for improved human health. In addition, since this model uses standard immune competent laboratory mice, the ease of use, cost and utility is likely greater than that of the current hACE2 transgenic models. While this model provides a critically necessary tool in COVID-19 countermeasure research, it also provides an important first step in SARS-CoV-2 serial adaptation in mice 23 , potentially selecting for variants that develop more severe pathogenic manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and other disease outcomes seen in human populations. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 MA strain can be used to evaluate the role of host innate immune genes and other antiviral defense genes in viral pathogenesis using transgenic and knockout mice.",

Neutralizing antibody levels were assessed via neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 WT expressing nanoluciferase (nLUC) in place of ORF7a. Briefly, the ORF7a gene of SARS-CoV-2 was removed from the molecular clone and nLUC inserted downstream of the ORF7a transcription regulatory sequence. Recombinant viruses encoding nLUC (SARS-CoV-2 nLUC) were recovered, titered and serial dilutions of sera were incubated with virus for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, then added to monolayers of Vero E6 cells. 48hrs post infection, viral infection was quantified using nLUC activity via Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated from full dilution curves. Mice were challenged 4 weeks post boost with 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU) intranasally under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Body weight was monitored daily.
