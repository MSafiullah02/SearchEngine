Case presentation A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. Discussion Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test. Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.",

He underwent plastic surgery in 2016 for reparation of a sacral pressure ulcer. In 2019 he was hospitalized three times for severe urinary tract infections, all sustained by gram negative bacteria.

Moreover, as some patients who are COVID-19 positive do not have symptoms one needs to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in all individuals with SCI and fever, regardless of their symptoms.",
