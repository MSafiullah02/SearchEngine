            "text": "Tremendous advances have been made in the medical care of newborn foals over the past 50 years, thanks to the pioneering efforts of many individuals and research groups and the increasing sophistication of veterinary medicine as a whole. Although the field of human neonatology has provided critically important guidance regarding the physiology and pathophysiology of the neonatal foal, and will continue to do so, fundamental insights have been achieved into the unique characteristics of this special population. The foundations of equine neonatology were built on the earliest descriptions of specific conditions in foals by clinician researchers, such as septicemia, joint ill, and hemolytic icterus,1, 2, 3, 4 as well as the \u201cdummy foal\u201d syndrome and the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) associated with primary surfactant deficiency.5, 6 Significant strides were also being made in the understanding of the physiology of the equine fetus and neonate, in large part because of the efforts of a group of researchers working in the UK.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 As the knowledge base grew dramatically,24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 there was increasing interest in providing improved care for the equine neonate, in large part because of the substantial investments of time, energy, and equity involved in the lengthy process of conception, gestation, parturition, and juvenile development. Owners were very interested in optimizing foal survival, and this interest, along with the increasing capability for providing effective critical care for foals, led to the development of neonatal intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide in the 1980s. Since that time there has been a steady increase in our understanding and ability to successfully treat and manage the critically ill foal. The result has been a dramatic improvement not only in the likelihood of survival but also the ability of surviving foals to mature into sound, healthy individuals that are able to perform their intended function.30 Our knowledge base in equine neonatology continues to grow, and the goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of the current knowledge in this field as well as to provide some insights derived from human medicine.",

Physical abnormalities, such as abdominal wall muscular tears or prepubic tendon rupture, represent serious risks to both the dam and the fetus. Uterine torsion represents a life-threatening situation for the mare and the fetus, and if correction is successful the fetus must be regarded at high risk for the duration of the pregnancy.",

Conditions such as endometriosis or twinning can reduce the available surface area for placental attachment, resulting in impaired transfer of nutrients and waste products between the fetus and the dam and potentially causing intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Placental dysfunction can result from abnormalities such as placental detachment, placentitis, placental edema, hydrops, and vascular inflammation or injury.31 Exposure of the mare to any possible infectious causes of abortion or maternal ingestion of endophyte-infested fescue also can represent serious risk factors to the fetus.32, 33 Although there are often no outward signs of placental abnormalities, the development of excessive abdominal distention, vulvar discharge, or premature udder development may suggest their presence. A number of fetal factors can complicate pregnancy as well, including fetal malformations (congenital or developmental), fetal malpositioning, twinning, exposure to infectious agents, and neonatal isoerythrolysis.",

A complete blood count and serum chemistry profile may be helpful in that regard.

            "text": "Ultrasound examination will provide the opportunity to thoroughly evaluate the placenta to assess placental attachment, placental thickness, and the echogenicity of the fetal fluids.34, 35, 36 The transabdominal approach allows for prolonged periods of examination and allows for a thorough assessment of the uterus, placenta, and fetus.37 After 4 months\u2019 gestation both transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonographic examinations should be performed to ensure thorough assessment. After 6 months of gestation transrectal ultrasonography can also be used to regularly monitor variables such as fetal heart rate, eye diameter, and fetal activity.38 Although transrectal ultrasound examination does not allow visualization of all fetal structures, it is very useful during late gestation, because the caudal uterine body is the most common site for ascending placentitis to develop.35 Measurement of the combined thickness of the uterus and placenta (CTUP) is a useful indicator of placental abnormalities, but this assessment should only be performed in areas of the placenta not in contact with the fetus. Although the CTUP can be measured transabdominally, this approach is more challenging because of the variations in the location measured as well as the potential for fetal contact compressing the placenta.39 It is preferred to measure the CTUP transrectally at a site near the cervicoplacental junction, at which a branch of the uterine can be visualized between the uterus and the bladder, using the average of several measurements.36 Normal measurements of the CTUP have been reported to be 0.6 cm at 7 months\u2019 gestation, less than 0.8 cm at 9 months, less than 1.0 cm at 10 months, and up to 1.0 to 1.2 cm at the end of gestation.36, 40 It is important to remember that even though an increased CTUP may suggest placental abnormalities it does not represent a definitive finding. There are reports of increased CTUP measurements that were not associated with placental pathology, and conversely ascending placentitis is not always associated with an increase in CTUP. 35, 36, 41 Although there may also be breed and parity influences on CTUP measurements, the 1.2-cm upper limit represents a reasonable cutoff for most Light Horse and Warmblood breeds.42 Placental detachment may be associated with accumulation of exudate between the placental and uterine surfaces, which is typically hyperechoic in ultrasonographic appearance.",

Fetal viability can be assessed using fetal heart rate and rhythm, as well as fetal activity patterns and fetal responses to stimulation. Fetal heart rates change throughout gestation, trending from a high of 135 \u00b1 6 beats per minute at 91 to 120 days\u2019 gestation to 67 \u00b1 12 beats per minute at 330 to 360 days\u2019 gestation.43 Transient alterations in fetal heart rate may be observed but do not likely indicate fetal distress unless they persist. Persistent tachycardia or bradycardia may be an indication of impending fetal death.44, 45 Fetal heart rate should increase during periods of fetal activity and return to normal ranges thereafter. Fetal electrocardiography can be used for monitoring fetal heart rate and rhythm as well and was widely used several decades ago but has fallen out of favor because of the ready availability, ease of use, and diagnostic yield associated with ultrasonographic fetal assessment. A recent report described the use of telemetric electrocardiography equipment for monitoring fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability, and this tool may hold some promise for fetal assessment in the future.46 A biophysical profile based on ultrasonographic fetal assessment has been developed for use in late gestation, and this includes fetal heart rate, fetal activity, fetal aortic diameter, CTUP, uteroplacental contact, and maximal allantoic fluid depth.43, 45, 47\n",

Because of the very late maturation of the equine fetus in the last 1 to 2 weeks of gestation, combined with the difficulty of determining fetal readiness for birth, it is rarely advisable to induce delivery. It is far better in most situations to attempt to support the fetus in utero as best as possible while awaiting natural delivery.48 If there are complications that threaten the survival of the dam, then cesarean section or induction of parturition may be indicated, although the survival of the foal should be considered highly unlikely. The other situation in which intervention may be indicated is if the fetus is thought to be near term and the mare suffers from a condition such as severe colic that is endangering fetal survival, although the prognosis for foal survival again remains poor.",

Ideally these mares will be housed in a facility that is able to provide 24-hour monitoring and that has a team available to deal with any eventualities appropriately and in a timely manner. All necessary equipment needs to be organized and readily available. Thorough discussions with owners and agents need to occur before any crises so that all involved know the priorities regarding what procedures are authorized and whether the mare\u2019s life or the foal\u2019s life is the focus of the teams\u2019 efforts.",

At birth the lungs must expand and clear themselves of fluid for gas exchange to occur, and this process must be coordinated with a shift in blood flow into the pulmonary circulation. If all elements of this transition do not occur within a few minutes, the foal will not be able to survive in the external environment.

This process begins in the period starting approximately 5 days before birth, when the fetal cortisol concentration rapidly begins to rise.17 This increase prepares the body for many of the processes that may have little or no role in utero but are critical for survival after birth, such as respiration, renal sodium conservation, and glucose metabolism.62 Serum cortisol concentrations continue to rise in the first few hours after birth before decreasing to normal basal values by approximately 1 day of age in healthy foals.63 Very premature foals (<320 days\u2019 gestation) have low cortisol concentrations at birth, and these do not increase appropriately in the first 2 hours of life.64 In addition to changes in the HPA axis there are also increases in circulating catecholamines, insulin, and glucagon, as well as thyroid hormones (T3, T4) associated with the immediate postpartum period.62\n",

Once the lungs begin to inflate the action of surfactant contributes to further clearance of airway fluid and the maintenance of alveolar stability and lung inflation. Before birth the fetal circulation functionally bypasses the pulmonary circulation by shunting through the ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale. Once the foal begins to breathe the resistance in the pulmonary vasculature dramatically decreases, allowing blood from the pulmonary artery to enter the pulmonary vasculature rather than passing through the ductus arteriosus into the aorta. As the pressure in the left side of the heart increases, the foramen ovale closes, preventing the shunting of blood from the right atrium to the left atrium. Complete closure of the ductus arteriosus may take several days, and it is not unusual to hear a \u201cmachinery\u201d-type murmur associated with patency of the ductus arteriosus in foals during the first 1 to 3 days of life.

Following these initial breaths most foals will continue to exhibit elevated respiratory rates of 50 to 75 breaths per minute for the first 20 to 30 minutes of life.

This is particularly challenging because nutrient intake transitions from a continuous mode, in which the dam ensures a continuous, regulated supply of glucose at all times, to intermittent energy intake based on milk ingestion. The pancreas must assume responsibility for the maintenance of normoglycemia through the differential production of glucagon and insulin. These dramatic alterations in energy metabolism may not always occur smoothly, and unfortunately the foal possesses limited energy reserves in the form of glycogen and fat. The result is that hypoglycemia occurs over the first 1 to 2 hours of life even in the normal neonatal foal, and the sick foal is at risk of profound hypoglycemia if deprived of energy intake for even a few hours. The metabolic response of the foal is to increase production of glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol and suppress insulin production, increasing circulating blood glucose concentrations. Glycogenolysis provides a ready source of glucose, but hepatic glycogen stores are minimal in the foal, so gluconeogenesis rapidly becomes the primary route of endogenous glucose production. Premature or dysmature foals often have impaired glucose regulation and are susceptible to pathologic hypoglycemia in the absence of appropriate dietary or parenteral supplementation.",

Colonization occurs through environmental exposure and is likely facilitated by the coprophagic behavior routinely exhibited by foals. Colostral immunoglobulins and oligosaccharides may play a role in regulating the composition of the gastrointestinal flora by affecting the ability of certain bacteria to attach to the mucosal surface and by opsonizing certain bacteria, facilitating the mucosal immune response to these organisms.79 By 2 to 4 weeks of age the microbial population has become similar in composition and complexity to that of the foal\u2019s dam, which indicates a transition to an adult pattern in readiness for the dietary transition from a milk-based diet to a roughage-based diet.80, 81\n",

This challenge is increased by the presence of an initially wet hair coat, which enhances thermal losses to the environment as well as a large surface area to body mass ratio and minimal stores of fat. The healthy foal has a high resting metabolic rate compared with the adult, and in the immediate neonatal period the metabolic rate will be increased at two to three times the basal rate, in association with high concentrations of T3, T4, and cortisol.82 This high metabolic rate allows for substantial endogenous heat production to achieve and maintain normothermia. This metabolic heat production requires substantial inputs of energy in the form of fats and carbohydrates derived from colostrum and milk, reinforcing the critical need for early successful nursing in foals. Another important mechanism that foals rely on for heat production in the immediate neonatal period is shivering thermogenesis. This appears to be particularly important, because foals do not appear to use nonshivering thermogenesis because of minimal or nonexistent stores of brown fat.83 Foals also use behavioral approaches to thermoregulation, ranging from maintenance of sternal recumbency to minimize heat losses to vigorous activity when attempting to stand and once ambulatory, which generates substantial additional heat.",

Following initiation of resuscitation efforts cardiac and respiratory function should be reassessed at 2- to 3-minute intervals unless the foal shows obvious signs of response (Box 20.1). Monitoring via electrocardiography can be challenging, because electrical activity does not necessarily represent effective cardiac contractility, which is a phenomenon termed pulseless electrical activity. Respiratory efforts are much more readily observed and their effectiveness subjectively evaluated. One technique that can greatly facilitate monitoring during resuscitation is the monitoring of end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), if capnography is available. The sensor is placed on the endotracheal tube and real-time monitoring is readily performed. Normal resting EtCO2 in a healthy spontaneously breathing patient is approximately 40 mm Hg (35\u201345 mm Hg), whereas the CO2 in room air is 0.3 mm Hg. During resuscitation a reasonable target for EtCO2 is 10 mm Hg, because this indicates that an adequate degree of perfusion and ventilation is being achieved. If resuscitation is successful then a rapid increase in EtCO2 toward the normal range will be observed, indicating that both perfusion and ventilation are improving. A decrease in EtCO2 during resuscitation indicates inadequate ventilation and perfusion, requiring reevaluation of how resuscitation is being performed. If no response is detected after 10 to 15 minutes of resuscitation it is extremely unlikely that the patient will respond with further efforts.",

These manifestations of disease are the same as those previously used to define sepsis, but the appreciation that many different stimuli can induce this response has resulted in sepsis being redefined as SIRS because of infection (Table 20.1\n).128, 129 The changes associated with SIRS can lead to shock, which is characterized by severe hypotension not responsive to IV fluid therapy (Box 20.2\n). Shock can result in hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction such that homeostasis cannot be maintained without intervention. This process is termed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).125 MODS represents a progressive syndrome with initial dysfunction seen in the cardiovascular system, followed by involvement of the respiratory, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, cardiac, and neurologic systems. These processes result in the development of refractory hypotension, lactic acidosis, and oliguria and may progress to death. SIRS criteria were proposed 15 years ago for the neonatal foal population and are based on human criteria using information regarding normal values in foals.124, 130 SIRS criteria have been used in a number of studies of clinically ill foals since that time and have been correlated with increases in both lactate concentration and mortality.130, 131 A recent report has proposed a revised set of SIRS criteria that are age dependent and based on insight from revised human pediatric SIRS criteria and that incorporate the changes in normal values that occur with increasing age in foals (Table 20.2\n).132\nBOX 20.2Pathophysiology of Shock in the Neonatal Foal\n\nAdapted from McKenzie HC, Furr MO.

It serves a vital role because it enhances the movement of phagocytic cells and defensive molecules, such as immunoglobulin and complement, from the bloodstream to the site of infection or injury. The first step in this process is the recognition of tissue injury or microbial invasion. Trauma or microbial invasion results in tissue injury, and injured cells then release or produce damage-associated molecular patterns, and these mediators can initiate a nonspecific inflammatory response.133 Alternatively, specific bacterial cell components, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), may be recognized by immune cells that produce inflammatory mediators, leading to the initiation of an inflammatory response and subsequent amplification of that response.133, 134 Some of the PAMPs that can be recognized by the immune system include lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin), exotoxins from gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acids, enterotoxins, or superantigenic exotoxins from gram-positive bacteria.124, 135 The development of an inflammatory response is dependent on the production, primarily by the activated mononuclear phagocyte, of numerous inflammatory mediators, including proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1,] interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6), proinflammatory enzymes (inducible nitric oxide synthase, phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2]) and adhesion molecules (selectins and intercellular adhesion molecules).136 The transcription of many of the genes encoding for these mediators, or the enzymes that produce them, is dependent on the transcription activator nuclear factor-\u03baB, and this molecule may be a potential target for intervention in SIRS.137, 138, 139\n",

            "text": "It is important to understand that although bacterial infection may be responsible for the initiation of an inflammatory response, the inflammatory process itself results solely from the production of endogenous mediators. The initial changes seen in an inflammatory response are primarily the result of local vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability caused by the effects of vasoactive mediators released by the injured or infected cell. On their arrival at the site of tissue injury, neutrophils and macrophages phagocytose foreign material and injured or dead tissue cells and attempt to destroy the phagocytosed material. In addition, macrophages release a number of factors that augment the immune response, including the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18. These proinflammatory cytokines increase the production of secondary inflammatory mediators, including phospholipid derivatives (prostaglandins, thromboxane A2, and leukotrienes), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), further increasing the activity of the inflammatory response. The systemic manifestations of inflammation/infection (fever, lethargy, malaise, loss of appetite, and cachexia) are primarily caused by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1. The cytokines IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 initiate the acute phase response in which the liver increases production of acute-phase proteins (fibrinogen, serum amyloid A, plasminogen, complement, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, etc.).140 These substances are important in many phases of the response to inflammatory stimuli, including complement activation, coagulation, fibrinolysis, transport of substances within the bloodstream, inhibition of neutrophil proteases, and modulation of the inflammatory response.141 The acute phase response is critical in inflammation, healing, and adaptation to noxious stimuli. Also included in the acute phase response is a counterregulatory antiinflammatory component that normally functions to minimize and resolve the inflammatory response to localized stimuli. This counterregulatory response consists of antiinflammatory mediators that inhibit macrophage activation (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, adrenal corticosteroids, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and prostaglandin-E2), antagonists to the receptors for proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 receptor antagonists), and soluble receptors of proinflammatory cytokines (soluble IL-1 receptor type II and soluble TNF receptors).142 The balance between these proinflammatory and antiinflammatory components is very important in determining the characteristics of the inflammatory response, because excessive activity of the antiinflammatory component may result in immunosuppression during or after a severe inflammatory response, which has been termed the compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome.125\n",

SIRS, the excessive, malignant form of the inflammatory and acute-phase responses, is characterized by the systemic activity of numerous proinflammatory mediators. These mediators all represent components of the normal inflammatory response to a localized stimulus, but the systemic activity of these proinflammatory mediators may result in an excessive, and often detrimental, response. One of the first effects seen in SIRS is widespread endothelial activation, resulting in the increased production of vasoactive mediators and alteration of vascular homeostasis. Inflammatory cytokines are responsible for activation of the endothelium, and the activated cells produce inflammatory cytokines, as well as increased amounts of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and endothelin-1.143 Activated endothelial cells retract from one another, increasing the size of the intercellular pores and allowing for increased vascular permeability, and increase their production of tissue factor and von Willebrand factor, resulting in localized thrombosis and platelet adherence.144\n",

These effects can progress to the syndrome of hyperdynamic shock, with increases in heart rate and cardiac output developing as compensatory mechanisms to maintain tissue perfusion.146 This compensatory response is impaired by the reduction in left ventricular preload resulting from decreased peripheral vascular resistance, combined with decreased cardiac contractility.147 Changes occurring in the microvasculature further contribute to the impairment of tissue perfusion. Arteriolar vasoconstriction develops because of the impairment of the normal autoregulatory systems caused by inflammatory cytokines and endothelin-1, combined with the increased production of vasoconstrictive substances. Adherence of neutrophils to the endothelium and endothelial cell swelling further reduces blood flow. Accumulation of fibrin and aggregation of platelets and red blood cells secondary to activation of the clotting system results in occlusion of the vasculature, resulting in tissue hypoperfusion. Arteriovenous shunting occurs in some tissues, whereas increased vascular permeability results in leakage of intravascular fluid into the interstitial space, further contributing to hypotension and hypovolemia and contributing to the development of tissue edema.

The development of MODS is likely the result of cardiovascular dysfunction leading to tissue hypoperfusion combined with changes in cellular metabolism that result in impairment of oxygen delivery and uptake.158 Tissue hypoxia is manifested by increased oxygen extraction ratios and metabolic acidosis caused by increased lactate production. Pulmonary dysfunction is manifested by refractory hypoxemia, potentially caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability, microthrombi formation, pulmonary epithelial injury, pulmonary edema, and impairment of surfactant production.159 Renal dysfunction is manifested by the development of azotemia and oliguria, and this acute renal failure is likely caused by alterations in the distribution of intrarenal blood flow arising from microvascular alterations with or without systemic hypotension.158 Gastrointestinal dysfunction is primarily manifested by the presence of ileus but may also result in loss of the normal barrier function of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Impairment of the mucosal barrier may further contribute to the pathogenesis of MODS caused by bacterial translocation or endotoxin absorption.160 Hepatic dysfunction is manifested by the development of hyperbilirubinemia and in some cases increased serum activities of hepatic enzymes (sorbitol dehydrogenase [SDH] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]).158 Hepatic dysfunction may result from hypoperfusion but may be heightened by the production of inflammatory mediators by the hepatic Kupffer cells secondary to the actions of systemic mediators or stimuli derived from the gastrointestinal tract.161 Dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) is frequently present and may manifest as depression, which can progress to septic encephalopathy with extensive neuronal injury.162 The development of consumptive coagulopathy (DIC) could also be considered a component of MODS, rather than merely a pathophysiologic process contributing to the development of organ failure.",

Septic neonatal foals have been demonstrated to exhibit lower white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and higher band neutrophil and monocyte counts compared with healthy age-matched control foals.152 Azotemia is commonly encountered in this population but may reflect placental insufficiency (spurious hypercreatininemia) rather than neonatal sepsis or renal insufficiency.114, 166 Azotemia typically resolves rapidly with standard treatment unless underlying renal disease or uroperitoneum is present.166 Blood glucose abnormalities are common in septic foals, with hypoglycemia being the most common.131 This is likely caused by decreased milk intake combined with limited endogenous energy stores but may also be associated with SIRS. Arterial blood gas evaluation is extremely useful and often reveals the presence of acidosis, which may be metabolic, respiratory, or mixed in nature. Hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia may also be identified, typically in more severely affected patients. The measurement of blood lactate concentration is increasingly performed because of the availability of handheld lactate meters, and hyperlactatemia is a common finding.167, 168, 169 Blood lactate concentrations are consistently higher in normal neonatal foals than normal adult horses for the first 24 to 72 hours of life, with normal foals exhibiting values of up to 5.0 mmol/L in the first 24 hours,20, 64 with a recent report finding values as high as 10.2 mmol/L immediately after birth.167 In that study lactate concentrations steadily decreased over the first 3 days of life, but the median concentration at 72 hours remained slightly increased relative to normal adult concentrations, at 1.7 mmol/L. Serial measurement of blood lactate may be useful in assessing the foal\u2019s response to therapy, because the failure to normalize lactate over time has been associated with a poor prognosis for survival.170\n",

            "text": "The most definitive test for antemortem identification of the septicemic equine neonate remains blood culture, which should be performed at presentation in any equine neonate with a clinical suspicion of sepsis, ideally before the administration of antimicrobial therapy. This test has been reported to have fairly poor sensitivity, with false negative results obtained in up to 37% of cases of fatal septicemia.171 It is likely that the false negative rate would be much higher in less severely ill foals that recover with antimicrobial therapy. For this reason, it has been recommended that multiple samples be collected to maximize the sensitivity of blood culture, but the majority of isolates have been reported to be present in the first culture sample, and the need for immediate antimicrobial therapy usually results in only one sample being obtained. Although it is recommended that blood culture sampling should occur before the initiation of antimicrobial therapy, there is evidence in human patients that a delay in the initiation of antimicrobial therapy of more than 3 hours from the onset of clinical signs is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and current recommendations suggest a delay of no more than 1 hour.172, 173, 174, 175 In the referral setting most foals will have been exhibiting signs of sepsis for longer than that period of time, so early blood culture collection and initiation of antimicrobial therapy is critical. For this reason when a case is being referred from the field it is advisable to initiate antimicrobial therapy on the farm before referral if transport to the referral center is likely to require more than 30 minutes. Although this may decrease the likelihood of obtaining a positive blood culture, the benefit of early treatment likely outweighs the loss of diagnostic information. It is also important to obtain bacterial cultures from suspected areas of infection during the course of treatment because the blood culture may be falsely negative or nosocomial infection may have developed during the course of treatment. The appropriate samples are dependent on the system affected but could include transtracheal aspirate, blood, urine, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and umbilical remnants following surgical resection.",

The identification of the septic neonate remains problematic, however, because neonates presenting with clinical abnormalities consistent with sepsis (SIRS) may be negative on blood culture with no evidence of a focal site of infection. Attempts to identify equine neonates with septicemia have included the development of a sepsis scoring system combining historical information, objective data, and subjective measures to derive a numerical representation of the patient\u2019s condition.24, 117 Using a cutoff of \u226512 the sensitivity and specificity of the modified version of this scoring system were reported to be 93% and 86%, respectively. Unfortunately the specificity and sensitivity may not always be this high; a subsequent study found that the modified sepsis score yielded sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 76%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84%, and an NPV of 55%.186 The authors of that report suggested that it might be that this scoring system must be adapted to each ICU in which it is applied to achieve reasonably high levels of sensitivity and specificity. In another study the modified sepsis scoring system failed to predict sepsis in 49% of bacteremic foals.178 A more recent study investing the application of the modified sepsis scoring system in a large population of 1065 foals proposed a revised cutoff value of >7, resulting in a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 41.8%, compared with the original cutoff of \u226512, which had a sensitivity of 56.4% and specificity of 73.4%.187\n",

An initial antimicrobial regimen should provide broad-spectrum coverage including organisms commonly identified in the practice population or region. While a detailed discussion of antimicrobial therapy can be found in the antimicrobial section of this chapter, a reasonable initial approach is the use of penicillin or ampicillin in combination with an aminoglycoside, typically amikacin. If there are concerns regarding renal insufficiency then the aminoglycoside can be replaced by a third-generation cephalosporin. Monotherapy with a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin may be a reasonable alternative to combination therapy, particularly in the severely dehydrated patient, but may not provide full coverage for gram-positive pathogens.",

Fluid therapy is indicated in the resuscitation and stabilization of clinically ill foals and can initially take the form of intermittent 20-mL/kg boluses given over 10 to 30 minutes. This typically needs to be accompanied by appropriate maintenance fluid therapy (see later section Fluid Therapy in the Foal). The presence of fluid-refractory hypotension may require the use of inotropic and vasopressor therapies (see later section Inotrope and Vasopressor Therapy). Respiratory support is beneficial, and in most cases it consists of intranasal insufflation of humidified oxygen at 5 to 10 L/min using a nasal cannula. Respiratory stimulants (caffeine and doxapram) may be beneficial in foals with decreased respiratory drive. If these interventions are not adequate then mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Additional therapies may include the administration of hyperimmune plasma, either for supplementation of immunoglobulins, colloidal support, or the treatment of SIRS. Antiinflammatory therapies are sometimes used, primarily consisting of nonsteroidals, but these sometimes including corticosteroid therapy if critical illness\u2013associated corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) is suspected (see later sections Antiinflammatory and Analgesic Therapy and Endocrine Disorders). Care should be taken regarding the use of antiinflammatory therapies in critically ill foals, however, because of the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or renal injury. Gastroprotectant therapy using proton pump inhibitors is generally not used in the first few days of life because of concerns regarding increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections, but sucralfate may be a reasonable option to those drugs (see later section Gastrointestinal Disorders). The use of low-molecular-weight heparin and/or the administration of fresh or fresh frozen plasma have been suggested to address coagulopathies in the critically ill foal.190, 195\n",

Foals should be kept warm and dry, which can be difficult in the recumbent patient because of frequent urination and defecation. The placement of a urinary catheter should be considered in these patients, even though it may present a risk regarding urinary tract infections, because it greatly facilitates their nursing care, decreases the risk of decubital ulceration, and provides a means of monitoring urine output. Recumbent foals should be kept in a sternal position as much as possible to minimize the development of atelectasis in the dependent lung, and they should be turned at no longer than 2-hour intervals. Feeding septic foals can be a challenge if gastrointestinal function is abnormal, and parenteral nutrition may be needed (see the later section Nutritional Support for the Foal). Blood glucose levels should be monitored frequently, especially in foals receiving parenteral nutritional support. The development of persistent hyperglycemia may require the institution of insulin therapy. If at all possible, foals should be weighed daily; this can be another means of monitoring for fluid retention.",

Given the broad range of prognostic indicators that one can use to assess the odds for survival of a critically ill foal, it can be challenging to provide an accurate and timely prognosis for the owner of such a patient. Experienced clinicians are able to provide accurate predictions for survival, but given that there will always be variations in clinician experience level and performance there has been substantial interest in developing a scoring system that could be used prospectively to enhance prognostic accuracy. In 1992 Hoffman et al. performed a study of predictive variables for survival in hospitalized neonatal foals.111 In that study they retrospectively identified two predictive variables, anion gap and the venous partial pressure of oxygen (Pvo\n2), and when these were applied prospectively in a population of 48 foals their model showed a PPV for survival of 62% and an NPV of 100%. In 1997 Furr et al. performed a similar study, developing a predictive equation for outcome in a population of 99 hospitalized neonatal foals.112 They identified several variables associated with nonsurvival, but their model ultimately retained a different set of predictive variables, which were heart rate, rectal temperature, and neutrophil count. This model yielded a PPV of 78% and an NPV of 78% in the retrospective population. When applied prospectively to two populations of hospitalized foals the model performed differently in the two populations, with a PPV of 93% and an NPV of 72% in one population as opposed to a PPV of 83% and an NPV of 44% in the other. This was likely caused by fundamental differences in the types of cases referred and the timing of presentation to the two different hospitals.",

This model yielded a PPV of 95% and an NPV of 65% in the retrospective population. When applied prospectively the model demonstrated a PPV of 90% and an NPV of 46%. Rohrbach et al. also reported the accuracy of clinician prediction of outcome, which was 83% in the retrospective population, as opposed to 81% accuracy for the mathematical model; however, the predictions were not well correlated. Interestingly, by combining the clinician\u2019s initial prediction with the model output they were able to improve the accuracy of the survival estimate by 12%.196 Another multicenter study was performed by Dembek et al., in which they developed a survival scoring system for critically ill foals.115 Their final model retained six variables, which were cold extremities, prematurity, \u22652 infection/inflammation sites, IgG concentration, glucose concentration, and WBC count. These variables were assigned scores depending on their respective values, and totaling of the individual scores yields the final survival score (Table 20.4\n). A score of 0 was associated with a 3% probability of survival, whereas the maximum score of 7 was associated with a 97% probability of survival (Table 20.5\n). They validated their foal survival score (FSS) prospectively using score cutoffs of \u22654 for foals predicted to survive and <4 for foals predicted to die, which resulted in values for a PPV of 91% and an NPV of 86%. Foals with an FSS of 4 to 5 were 24.2 more likely to survive than foals with a score <4, and foals with a score of 6 to 7 were 91 times more likely to survive.115 Most recently, Gigu\u00e8re et al. reported a retrospective study examining factors associated with survival in a population of 1065 hospitalized foals over 26 years at one academic referral hospital.116 The variables retained in their model included positive blood culture, neutropenia, hypothermia, bicarbonate, Pco\n2, presence of infectious orthopedic disorders, and sepsis score. The reported sensitivity of their model was 97%, and the specificity was 75%. Of particular interest was the increase in the odds of survival for foals born in the 1990s, which were 2.2 times greater compared with those born in the1980s, whereas foals born in the 2000s had a 3.4 times greater odds of survival compared with those born in the 1980s.116\n",

This term has recently come into use in the equine literature as well.65, 185, 197, 204 HIE is a specific type of NE typically associated with adverse peripartum events that result in episodes of cerebral hypoxia and ischemia. A wide variety of terms have been used synonymously with HIE in reference to affected foals, including neonatal maladjustment syndrome, perinatal asphyxia syndrome, dummy foal, wanderer, and barker foal.185, 205 The clinical presentation associated with HIE in foals can range quite dramatically from mild behavioral abnormalities to severe neurologic abnormalities including central blindness, seizures, coma, and death.206 Unfortunately these clinical signs are not specific for HIE, and diagnosis is typically made based on elimination of other potential etiologies. Indeed, the confusion associated with the nomenclature reflects the clinical challenges associated with determining the etiology of neurologic dysfunction in the neonatal foal, because it has long been recognized that many foals presenting with the clinical signs typically associated with HIE have no documented evidence of asphyxiation or a hypoxic-ischemic event.65, 207 The fact that many affected foals recover rapidly and demonstrate no neurologic sequelae, in contrast to the situation in human infants, further reinforces this dilemma.65 There is evidence that elevations in neurosteroid concentrations may be associated with NE in some cases, particularly those with no discernible history of a hypoxic insult.65, 67, 68, 205, 208, 209 A novel \u201csqueeze\u201d technique has been reported primarily as an aid in foal restraint and, although only anecdotal, in time this technique may have some benefit in moderating excessive inhibitory neurosteroid concentrations and improving foal consciousness.199\n",

The gastrointestinal tract and renal system appear most susceptible, but the cardiovascular system, pulmonary system, and liver and endocrine systems may all be involved.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of hypoxic injury is complex and may vary to some extent in different body systems, but the focus will be on the nervous system here. The initial insult of tissue hypoxia initiates a cascade of deleterious events. First, there is a shift toward anaerobic metabolism that leads to depletion of high-energy phosphate (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) reserves, accumulation of lactate, and a failure of cellular homeostasis.204 Decreased activity of transcellular pumps that depend on ATP leads to intracellular accumulation of sodium, calcium, and water.214 Membrane depolarization leads to release of the potent excitatory amino acid glutamate, which accumulates in the extracellular space. Glutamate then acts on the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, opening NMDA channels, potentiating calcium influx into the neurons, and contributing to neuronal injury.215 This cascade of events results in the development and perpetuation of excitotoxicity, which ultimately leads to neuronal cell death and brain injury.204, 214 Hypoxia and subsequent reperfusion also initiate the increased production of ROS and NO, ultimately resulting in the process known as reperfusion injury and leading to further tissue damage via cell death and activation of apoptotic cascades.204, 214 Tissue injury initiates an inflammatory response, leading to increased local blood flow and vascular permeability, which may result in the development of edema. Inflammatory cell infiltration leads to further tissue injury and upregulation of ROS production.185, 216 Increased concentrations of neurosteroids have been documented in affected foals, but their role in the pathophysiology of HIE is unclear because they may actually have a neuroprotective effect.65, 66, 68 In situations where the degree or duration of hypoxia is not overwhelming, a biphasic pattern of injury may be observed in which the initial acute phase of injury is stabilized, followed by an ongoing latent phase of injury that results in more severe clinical deterioration several hours later.214\n",

Unfortunately there is no definitive test for HIE, so diagnosis is typically made based on historical information, clinical presentation, and the elimination of other potential causes. Additional diagnostics that are used in human infants include electroencephalography (EEG) as well as imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).204 An EEG is difficult to accomplish in the unsedated foal, and interpretation can be confounded by patient movement or sedation, rendering this modality of limited use in foals. Brainstem auditory evoked response testing is widely used in human neonatal ICUs to aid in the assessment of CNS function and the diagnosis of HIE, and this technique has been described and validated in foals.217, 218 A recent report described the MRI findings associated with a presumptive case of NE in a foal, and the increasing availability of MRI in equine referral centers may render this modality of utility in the future.219 There has been tremendous interest in identifying biomarkers of HIE in human infants, and two potential biomarkers of HIE have been investigated in foals.206, 220 A recent study measured the plasma concentration of the phosphorylated axonal forms of neurofilament H (pNF-H) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1) and found that the diagnostic performance of UCHL1 was significantly higher than that of pNF-H, with the sensitivity and specificity of UCHL1 for diagnosis of neonatal HIE reported as 70% and 94%, respectively.206 This test is not available for clinical use at this time, however.",

Seizures are defined as abnormal, stereotyped, and paroxysmal alterations in neurologic function and may include behavioral changes, motor dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, and loss of consciousness.226 Seizure activity indicates neurologic dysfunction of the forebrain associated with abnormal electrical activity. Neonates appear to be at increased risk of seizure activity because of the relative excitability of the developing brain combined with the high risk of brain injury in the neonatal period.227 Diagnosis of seizure activity is primarily based on clinical signs but can be challenging because of the subtle signs in some cases, the potential confounding effects of other conditions altering patient behavior, neurologic function, or level of consciousness. Subtle signs may include abnormal eye movements, tremors, excessive stretching, excessive extensor tone, hyperesthesia, and apneustic breathing, whereas overt signs of seizures typically include rapid nystagmus, paddling, hyperextension, and excessive movements of the mouth.198 Unexplained physical trauma may represent evidence of unobserved seizure activity. Confirmation of seizure activity is achieved by EEG examination, but this can be challenging in foals. Specific treatment may not be required in individuals with very subtle or rare signs of seizure activity but is clearly indicated in patients with repeated, generalized seizure activity. Foals that exhibit seizure activity within the first 24 hours of hospitalization have been shown to have poorer outcomes than foals that do not exhibit seizure activity.205\n",

The use of corticosteroids as adjunct therapy in human patients has been associated with a reduction in neurologic sequelae but did not alter mortality.236, 237 The prognosis for survival in foals with appropriate treatment is fair to poor, depending on the severity of the presenting signs.228\n",

Severely affected foals may be found dead, but more commonly there is a sudden development of weakness, trembling, and dysphagia in a previously healthy foal.238 Progressive deterioration is typically observed, even with appropriate treatment, and respiratory paralysis is the cause of death in most cases. Diagnosis is typically presumptive based on the history and clinical presentation because confirmation requires demonstration of spores and/or toxin in the feces of affected animals, which can be difficult. A mouse bioassay has been validated for the diagnosis of botulism in horses and foals.240 This assay is highly specific in foals, with specificity and PPV reported as 100%, but it exhibits low sensitivity (53%) and NPV (52%).240 Treatment is based on the administration of antitoxin and the provision of supportive care. Foals that become recumbent will likely die unless they receive ventilatory support in the form of mechanical ventilation, which may be required for as long as 2 weeks.238 With early and appropriate care the prognosis for survival in cases of types B and C botulism is reported to be good.238 Type A botulism has been associated with more severe clinical signs and a higher case fatality rate, but a recent report described the successful treatment of a foal affected by type A botulism.241\n",

Although rare because of the widespread use of tetanus toxoid vaccines, recent cases have been reported in foals.242, 243 This syndrome usually affects foals over 7 days of age and is associated with the development of an anaerobic site of infection, reportedly most often within the umbilical remnants.244 Tetanospasmin acts to prevent the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by spinal interneurons, leading to disinhibition of spinal motor neurons, resulting in excessive motor activity and spastic paralysis.245 The primary clinical signs are rigidity, excessive autonomic activity, and episodic muscle spasms, which lead to trismus, facial spasm, third-eyelid protrusion, and dysphagia. Progression leads to recumbency, and death is usually caused by respiratory failure. Treatment of tetanus depends on the administration of tetanus antitoxin, supportive care, control of muscle spasms, and source control.242, 246 Control of muscle spasms is often accomplished using benzodiazepines, either administered as needed or by continuous rate infusion (CRI). Magnesium sulfate represents an affordable and viable option to benzodiazepines in humans and may be a reasonable option in foals as well.197 Source control may involve surgical excision or drainage of the site of infection in combination with antimicrobial therapy. Penicillin has been the standard treatment, but metronidazole may also be used. The prognosis for survival is good in cases that do not progress to recumbency, but it is guarded to poor once recumbency occurs, although recent success has been reported.242, 243\n",

These rapid changes in sodium concentration cause dramatic fluid shifts in the tissues of the CNS, with hyponatremia potentially being associated with the development of cerebral edema, whereas hypernatremia may cause an osmotic demyelination syndrome.250 Hyponatremia is more common than hypernatremia, and neurologic signs are most typically associated with sodium concentrations less than 120 mEq/L.249, 251 The neurologic manifestations of hyponatremia may include an abnormal stance or gait, depression, blindness, or seizures.252, 253 Treatment of these disorders involves correction of the underlying whole body sodium/water imbalances, because hyponatremia represents a free-water excess and hypernatremia a free-water deficit.254 Hyponatremia should be addressed by administering fluids that are relatively hypertonic compared with the plasma osmolality, and although the literature suggests that initial correction should be rapid followed by slower correction, a more conservative approach may be appropriate in foals.249 Hypernatremia should be addressed using fluids that are relatively hypotonic but should be gradual (<0.5 mEq/L/h).249\n",

Specific treatment may not be required in individuals with very subtle or rare signs of seizure activity, but it is clearly indicated in patients with repeated, generalized seizure activity. Benzodiazepines (diazepam and midazolam) represent the first-choice therapy for control of acute seizures in foals because of their rapid onset of action and minimal depressive effects (Table 20.7\n).30, 198 Bolus IV doses are used for the control of single seizure episodes, but CRI of midazolam can be used to control persistent seizures. Other options for the control of persistent seizures include phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and potassium bromide. Phenobarbital can cause substantial CNS depression when first administered but is generally well tolerated, even with prolonged use. Serum phenobarbital levels should be monitored when used long term to ensure that concentrations remain within the therapeutic range, which has been reported to be 5 to 30 \u03bcg/mL in foals.280 Pentobarbital should only be used in cases with status epilepticus that cannot be controlled with other medications and is associated with substantial risk caused by profound respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Phenytoin has unpredictable kinetics and is not widely used but has been suggested for anticonvulsant use in foals. Potassium bromide may be useful for long-term maintenance in foals with epilepsy because it has fewer side effects than phenobarbital and is well tolerated. Reported effective plasma concentrations of bromide in other species are 70 to 240 mg/dL, but this has not been validated in foals.281\n",

Although this has been appreciated in human and veterinary medicine for many years, it is only in the past decade that a consensus approach to this situation has been developed in veterinary medicine.291 The terms acute lung injury (ALI) and acute RDS (ARDS) were originally developed in human medicine to refer to a syndrome of respiratory failure associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, decreased pulmonary compliance, and ventilation/perfusion mismatching.292, 293 These syndromes are associated with an exaggerated and self-perpetuating inflammatory response, which results in severe tissue damage within the lungs. Protein-rich edema fluid accumulates within the alveoli and interstitium, resulting in impairment of gas exchange leading to hypoxemia.294 ALI and ARDS are not primary disease syndromes and always occur secondary to other disease processes. Risk factors for ALI and ARDS in human patients include processes resulting in both direct pulmonary injury (pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, smoke inhalation, pulmonary contusion, and drowning) and indirect pulmonary injury (nonpulmonary sepsis, pancreatitis, multiple transfusions, and major trauma).294\n",

Management of critically ill foals without this information is extremely difficult, because it is important in initial evaluation, formulation of an appropriate treatment plan, monitoring the response to treatment, and prognostication. Foals are most readily sampled in lateral recumbency using the lateral metatarsal artery and the brachial or transverse facial artery. Sampling should be performed quickly after placing the foal in lateral recumbency, and the patient should be returned to a sternal or standing position as soon as possible, because positioning in lateral recumbency has a substantial negative impact on arterial oxygenation (10\u201314 mm Hg). Diagnostically this impact can be addressed by using appropriate reference ranges derived from foals sampled in lateral recumbency (Table 20.9\n). The other major element that has to be factored in to interpretation of arterial blood gas data in neonatal foals is the changes in pulmonary function that occur over the course of the first several days of life, because newborn foals have a small degree of shunt fraction that renders them relatively hypoxemic and less responsive to oxygen supplementation than adults. This phenomenon is also addressed in Table 20.9.",

            "text": "The most common arterial blood gas abnormalities identified in neonatal foals are hypoxemia with normocapnia or hypocapnia and hypoxemia with hypercapnia. Hypoxemia can result from several mechanisms: hypoventilation, ventilation/perfusion mismatching, impaired diffusion, intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary (cardiac) shunts, and decreased concentration of oxygen in the inspired air (high altitude or inappropriate ventilator setting). Weak, recumbent neonatal foals will frequently suffer from hypoventilation, whereas the presence of intrapulmonary inflammation or surfactant deficiency will cause substantial ventilation/perfusion mismatching with intrapulmonary shunting of blood. Severe inflammation or pulmonary edema can cause diffusion impairment, whereas extrapulmonary shunts are most commonly associated with persistent fetal circulation or cardiac anomalies. Foals suffering from pneumonia typically show profound hypoxemia initially, but the development of hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis indicates substantial worsening of pulmonary function and is associated with a poorer prognosis for survival.111, 295\n",

            "text": "Treatment of NERDS is challenging, because the primary interventions used in human infants are not readily available in equine medicine (exogenous surfactant) or are only available in tertiary care referral centers (mechanical ventilation). Given the benefits of surfactant therapy in human respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) patients,297 this intervention is of great interest in affected foals, but the author\u2019s personal experience and the limited references to this therapy in the literature suggest that the effect of this therapy has a short duration and needs to be repeated frequently, making it difficult to justify the significant expense, if surfactant is even available.298, 299 Interestingly, one of the primary changes in the management of human neonates with RDS has been driven by the recognition that mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation, although life-saving in many cases, is also associated with the potential for serious acute complications and long-term pulmonary dysfunction.300 The acute complications may include trauma to the upper respiratory tract associated with intubation, increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections, pulmonary barotrauma and volutrauma, air leak syndromes (pneumothorax), and hemodynamic complications caused by impaired venous return, whereas the primary long-term complication is bronchopulmonary dysplasia.301 Because of these concerns noninvasive forms of respiratory support are widely used in human infants with RDS, which include all forms of respiratory support not delivered with an endotracheal tube.302 The simplest and most readily implemented form of noninvasive respiratory support in foals is the intranasal administration of humidified oxygen via intranasal cannula. Although a single cannula is most often used, this may not provide sufficient oxygen flow rates, in which case a second cannula can be placed in the opposite nostril, and combined flow rates of up to 20 L/minute can be readily delivered.303 A potential downside to bilateral cannula placement is that this may cause some degree of upper respiratory obstruction in small foals, potentially impairing exhalation and CO2 elimination, although this effect was not detected when this technique was investigated in healthy foals.303 If nasal cannulation is not possible or is not achieving adequate flow rates, then an intratracheal catheter can be used for oxygen insufflation, but this rarely represents anything more than a short-term solution.304\n",

In the most severely affected cases mechanical ventilation will represent the only viable means of respiratory support, and this technique is discussed in detail later in this section. However, noninvasive respiratory support strategies that provide continuous positive distending pressure, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), are widely used in human neonates with RDS and have been shown to reduce respiratory failure and mortality.305 There are a few older reports of noninvasive ventilatory support techniques for foals that used mechanical ventilators and either nasal prongs or face masks.306, 307 A recent report described the adaptation of a commercial human CPAP device and face mask to provide CPAP to foals.308 The authors reported that although both CPAP and nonpressurized oxygen supplementation with a face mask normalized pretreatment hypoxemia, oxygen extraction and CO2 elimination were highest with CPAP at a lower respiratory rate than nonpressurized oxygen administration. Both treatments were associated with the development of modest hypercarbia, but this was not associated with adverse effects.

Diagnosis of these syndromes is fundamentally similar to that of VetALI and VetARDS with the exception of the use of an age-specific scale of Pao\n2/Fio\n2 ratios based on blood gas values obtained from foals breathing room air and positioned in lateral recumbency, as is typically encountered in clinical practice. It is important to remember that EqNALI/EqNARDS is not a primary diagnosis, and affected foals may be suffering from a broad range of disease processes. There certainly may be overlap with NERDS, but bacterial sepsis and bacterial pneumonia will be the most common disease processes in foals of this age.

A paradoxic breathing pattern may be present, in which the thorax and abdomen move opposite from one another, rather than synchronously, during inspiration and expiration. Auscultation may reveal widespread abnormal sounds, with prominent wheezes and crackles, or lung sounds may be very quiet to absent with only large airway sounds detectable. Fever and injected mucous membranes are common as well. Care should be taken to auscult the heart thoroughly, which may be difficult in the presence of diffuse abnormal respiratory sounds, to rule out a cardiac cause of pulmonary edema. Clinicopathologic evaluation is important both for assessment of pulmonary function and identification of the primary underlying disease process. Arterial blood gas analysis is extremely helpful and should be performed before initiation of intranasal oxygen insufflation, if clinically appropriate. Complete blood count, fibrinogen concentration, and SAA concentration are all helpful in characterizing the severity of systemic inflammation, and very high WBC counts, fibrinogen, or SAA concentrations, although not definitive, may be suggestive of Rhodococcus equi infection.318, 319\n",

A transtracheal aspirate should be performed unless the patient is too unstable to undergo the procedure; this sample can provide important cytologic evidence regarding the type and severity of pulmonary inflammation and the presence of extracellular and intracellular bacteria and should also be submitted for bacterial culture and sensitivity. Neutrophilic inflammation is typically present, and the detection of intracellular gram-positive coccobacilli within pulmonary macrophages is strong evidence of the presence of R. equi.\n318 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of tracheal aspirates may be helpful in confirming rhodococcal involvement.323 Treatment of ALI/ARDS-affected foals should focus on addressing the hypoxemia, treating the primary underlying disease process, controlling the excessive inflammatory response, and providing supportive care. Intranasal oxygen insufflation, as described previously, should be initiated as soon as possible in foals suffering from respiratory distress and represents the primary means of respiratory support in these older foals. Antimicrobial therapy should target the most likely bacterial pathogens based on the overall assessment. In younger foals in which sepsis may be playing a primary role, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is recommended. In older foals empiric treatment should address the possible involvement of R. equi. Aggressive systemic antiinflammatory therapy using potent corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone sodium succinate, has been shown to be the most important intervention in effecting survival of affected foals.311, 312, 324 Corticosteroid therapy should be gradually tapered as the clinical condition improves, rather than rapidly withdrawn. Prolonged therapy has been shown to be beneficial in human ARDS patients.310 Bronchodilator therapy has been used in affected foals because of the severity of respiratory distress, but bronchoconstriction is not a prominent feature of ARDS, and bronchodilator administration may actually worsen the ventilation/perfusion mismatching and result in clinical deterioration or even death.293 If used, bronchodilator therapy should only be administered after nasal insufflation of oxygen has been instituted, and the clinician should be prepared to address sudden changes in clinical status. The use of the inhalational route for the administration of corticosteroids and bronchodilators in patients suffering from severe pulmonary dysfunction with substantial ventilation/perfusion mismatching is often unrewarding because of poor pulmonary penetration and delivery, so the systemic route is recommended. The prognosis for survival in affected foals is poor to guarded, with early and aggressive corticosteroid and antimicrobial therapy offering the best chance of survival.324\n",

PPHN should be suspected in any neonatal foal exhibiting progressive or refractory hypercapnic hypoxemia. Care should be taken to rule out the presence of congenital cardiac anomalies that may be causing extrapulmonary shunting of blood and other causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure, such as sepsis or infectious pneumonia. PPHN should be suspected in cases of hypoxemia that do not show a significant increase in Pao\n2 following the institution of intranasal oxygen therapy. Definitive diagnosis can be challenging, but ultrasonography can be very helpful in ruling out congenital cardiac anomalies and detecting primary pulmonary disease.",

The successful use of iNO therapy in foals has been reported,327 but unfortunately it is impractical in most settings because it requires mechanical ventilation along with specialized equipment for introducing the NO gas into the ventilator circuit.328 Sildenafil (Viagra, Pfizer Inc., New York), a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, has been used in humans and is reported to be effective.326, 329 There are anecdotal reports of the use of sildenafil in foals with PPHN, at a dosage rate of 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg PO, up to every 4 hours, starting at the lower end of the dosage range to avoid systemic hypotension.330 Although supported by only one case report in humans, the use of pentoxifylline, a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, as an adjunctive therapy may be worthy of consideration in foals because of availability, low cost, and an accepted safety profile.331, 332\n",

            "text": "There are a number of congenital upper respiratory tract disorders in foals, although none is common. These can include wry nose, choanal atresia, cleft palate, nasopharyngeal cysts, and subepiglottic cysts.333 Wry nose involves lateral and rotational deviations in the structure of the nose; in moderate to severe cases it will cause significant upper airway obstruction.334 Surgical repair is possible, but this must be regarded as a salvage procedure, because the prognosis for athletic function is poor.334 Choanal atresia is rare in foals but involves unilateral or bilateral soft tissue narrowing or complete obstruction of the caudal aspect of the nasal passages.335 Foals born with bilateral complete obstruction will die without rapid intervention to establish an airway because of the obligate nasal breathing nature of equines.333 Foals with unilateral choanal atresia often remain undiagnosed until later in life.336 Diagnosis is most often made using endoscopy, but CT examinations have been useful in some cases.336 Surgical correction is feasible, but the prognosis for performance remains guarded because of the persistent airway narrowing in many cases. Cleft palate deformities are rare and are reported in only 0.1% to 0.8% of foals.337 Most affected foals will show clinical signs of dysphagia when nursing, including coughing or nasal milk drainage, but this is inconsistent.338 Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication. The primary site of involvement is the soft palate, and the defect can range from a small, focal site to essentially the absence of the entire soft palate. Diagnosis is most readily made endoscopically, although surgical correction is theoretically possible; the approach is difficult and the outcome uncertain, especially with large defects.337 There is one recent report of successful transoral endoscopically assisted repair in a foal.339 Subepiglottic cysts are also rare in foals, but when present they can interfere with epiglottal placement, resulting in persistent palate displacement and severe dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia.333, 340 Diagnosis is primarily by endoscopic examination, although visualization may be difficult if the cyst is positioned below the palate. Radiographs or CT may be helpful in detecting these lesions. Treatment is by cyst removal, either via laryngotomy or by nasal or oral endoscopic approaches.333\n",

Meconium staining can occur before, during, or immediately after parturition, and meconium passage in utero is thought to primarily occur in response to fetal hypoxia leading to fetal stress. Fetal hypoxia also may result in fetal gasping, facilitating introduction of meconium into the respiratory tract while in utero. Meconium aspiration may also occur in association with the first few breaths after birth. The presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid does not guarantee that MAS will occur, however, because only 2% to 9% of human infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid develop MAS.341 When meconium contamination of the lower respiratory tract occurs there are a number of pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to pulmonary dysfunction, including mechanical airway obstruction, regional air trapping, surfactant inactivation, surfactant displacement, chemical pneumonitis and alveolitis, and persistent pulmonary hypertension.327, 341\n",

If more severe contamination is suspected then nasotracheal intubation followed by aseptic suctioning is suggested, although care must be taken to avoid contamination of the lower respiratory tract or overly zealous suction. Intranasal oxygen supplementation is recommended in affected foals, but mechanical ventilation will be required in more severely affected cases and is associated with a worsened prognosis. Mechanical ventilation is challenging in these cases because of the degree of pulmonary inflammation and airway compromise as well as the severity of ventilation/perfusion mismatching and strategies to minimize barotrauma, such as CPAP ventilation and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), which may be helpful.342, 343 Surfactant administration and lung lavage with dilute surfactant appear to be effective in human neonates with MAS but are not routinely used in foals.344 Antiinflammatory therapy may be beneficial because of the substantial pulmonary inflammation associated with MAS. Pentoxifylline has shown some promise in animal models, appears safe in foals, and is easily administered.345, 346 Corticosteroids, either inhaled or systemically administered, are commonly used in human infants with MAS.347, 348 Although meconium aspiration is not associated with primary bacterial pneumonia, affected foals are at risk of secondary bacterial infection, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is recommended.",

            "text": "Neonatal foals may aspirate milk into the lower respiratory tract secondary to a number of conditions, although this is most common secondary to generalized weakness, a poor suckle reflex, or dysphagia related to prematurity or NE.349 This risk may be exacerbated by attempts at bottle feeding foals affected with these problems. Other potential causes of aspiration include physical abnormalities such as subepiglottic cysts, cleft palate, megaesophagus, esophageal stenosis, esophageal compression by vascular anomalies, or persistent dorsal displacement of the soft palate.342, 349, 350 Functional abnormalities of the pharynx, larynx, and esophagus resulting in aspiration have been associated with pharyngeal dysfunction of unknown etiology, botulism, and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.342, 349, 351 Incorrect placement of nasoesophageal feeding tubes has also been associated with direct instillation of milk into the lungs, leading to aspiration pneumonia. Detection of milk aspiration can be difficult because some affected foals may not cough or show nasal milk regurgitation. Diagnosis is based on historic information that may reveal episodes of nasal milk regurgitation, physical examination findings demonstrating abnormal lower respiratory sounds, and clinicopathologic evidence of systemic inflammation (inflammatory leukogram and hyperfibrinogenemia or increased SAA) and pulmonary dysfunction (arterial hypoxemia).342 Endoscopic examination of the upper respiratory tract may reveal structural abnormalities of the pharynx, larynx, or esophagus suggestive of aspiration, or pharyngeal dysfunction may be observed. Thoracic radiographs typically reveal an alveolar pattern with or without air bronchograms in the caudoventral lung, but this may be localized to the perihilar region.321 It is important to pursue the identification and correction of the cause of aspiration, if possible, to prevent further aspiration. Placement of a nasoesophageal feeding tube will allow for the safe delivery of milk pending correction of the underlying disorder. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is indicated to address the bacterial pneumonia accompanying milk aspiration, and successful treatment may require several weeks of treatment.",

            "text": "Rib fractures are a fairly common problem, having been reported in 3% to 5% of the general population of neonatal foals and as many as 30% of foals presenting to a neonatal ICU.353 Fractured ribs can cause a number of traumatic insults to the thoracic viscera, including pulmonary contusions and lacerations of the lungs, major arteries, heart, or diaphragm. Pneumothorax, hemothorax, and diaphragmatic herniation may all occur as a result of these traumatic insults, and myocardial injury is typically fatal. Rib fractures can be single, but are often multiple, most often affecting adjacent ribs on one side of the chest. The most common site of injury is at the costochondral junction or immediately dorsal to it.354 Flail chest, or paradoxic thoracic wall motion, may occur when multiple ribs are fractured, and the affected region will move inward during inspiration and outward during expiration, counter to the movements of the intact portions of the thoracic wall. Rib fractures are commonly found on physical examination by palpation of the fracture itself or by the detection of crepitus at the site of the fracture. Auscultation may reveal grinding or \u201cclicking\u201d sounds in the area of the fracture as well. Confirmation of the diagnosis is best accomplished ultrasonographically because this modality is much more sensitive than radiography for this purpose.355 Ultrasonography may also be used to document the presence of air, blood, or abdominal viscera within the thoracic cavity, although radiography may be helpful in this evaluation. Treatment depends on the structures involved and the severity of the complications observed. Most minimally displaced rib fractures, particularly those involving the costochondral junction, can be managed conservatively with stall rest and avoidance of pressure on the affected area when the foal is handled. Mild to moderate pneumothorax may not require intervention, but if substantial air is presented within the pleural cavity it will cause respiratory distress and should be evacuated. Placement of an indwelling thoracic catheter will facilitate ongoing drainage. If multiple ribs are fractured, and particularly if sharp bony projections are exposed and threatening internal injury, then surgical repair may be indicated.356 Hemothorax can be life-threatening because of pulmonary compression and/or severe blood loss anemia, and treatment should focus on addressing the primary cause of hemorrhage and patient stabilization and support.357\n",

            "text": "Viral pneumonia is uncommon in neonatal foals but has been associated with EHV-1, EHV-4, equine influenza virus (EIV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and equine adenovirus (EAdV). EHV-1 infections in neonatal foals are severe and typically fatal, despite aggressive treatment. One of the challenges associated with these cases is the difficulty of ascertaining EHV-1 involvement, because the presenting signs are very similar to neonatal sepsis. Foals may be delivered somewhat early and with little or no warning of impending parturition, and the placenta is usually grossly normal.328 Farm outbreaks have been reported.184, 358, 359 Clinical signs are of cardiovascular and respiratory insufficiency, and the mucous membranes are severely congested and icteric. Clinicopathologic abnormalities include severe leukopenia with neutropenia, toxic neutrophil morphology, and lymphopenia. The combination of severe leukopenia and icterus may be suggestive of EHV-1 infection.183 Bone marrow examination will reveal depletion of the myeloid cell lines. Many affected foals will display dilation of the retinal vasculature with reddish discoloration of the optic disk. Diagnostic confirmation is most readily accomplished by PCR testing of nasal secretions or whole blood. Treatment of affected foals with acyclovir has been attempted, and this appeared to have some efficacy in less severely affected foals.184 Given the superior bioavailability of valacyclovir in adult horses, this drug may represent a more suitable choice for use in EHV-1\u2013infected foals.328, 360 EHV-4 appears to be a rare cause of neonatal disease and is more commonly associated with abortion or stillbirth, but it has been associated with neonatal mortality caused by multisystemic disease.361, 362\n",

The bacteria associated with neonatal pneumonia are typically the same as those involved in neonatal sepsis, and gram-negative bacteria are the organisms most commonly involved. Gram-positive infections appear to be increasing in prevalence, however, and mixed infections occur as well.404 The most common isolate is E. coli, with Klebsiella spp., Actinobacillus spp., Pasteurella spp. Salmonella spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. also occurring with some frequency.25, 171, 176, 178, 180, 181 Successful treatment depends on early and effective support of respiratory function with correction of hypoxemia, control of systemic and pulmonary inflammation, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately antimicrobial selection is almost always empiric initially, but collection of blood culture samples before initiation of antimicrobial therapy is encouraged to provide confirmation of bacterial involvement and to guide future antimicrobial therapy on the basis of antimicrobial sensitivity patterns. Transtracheal aspirates are not commonly performed in neonatal foals because they can be technically challenging and may worsen the foal\u2019s respiratory distress. They can be very useful diagnostically, especially when the respiratory infection is secondary to aspiration.404 Because of the possibility of polymicrobial and mixed infections, broad-spectrum therapy is recommended initially. This often consists of a \u03b2-lactam (penicillin) in combination with an aminoglycoside, but a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftiofur, may represent a better choice because of its superior pulmonary penetration.328\n",

This age group of foals may be at risk for the development of respiratory infections caused by decaying levels of maternal immunoglobulins in conjunction with delayed endogenous immunoglobulin production and possibly impaired immunologic responses to pathogen exposure. Additional risk factors in older foals include the stresses of weaning and sales preparation and transport, as well as confinement in crowded or dusty conditions that result in heavy exposure to potential respiratory pathogens. Secondary infection with gram-negative organisms is not uncommon, and foals in which this occurs may exhibit a poor response to treatment or deteriorate clinically in the face of treatment. Viral infections such as EHV-1, EHV-4, and EIA may cause pulmonary inflammation and injury, whereas other viral infections such as EHV-2 may directly impair pulmonary immune responses, facilitating the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia.",

This organism was first isolated from foals with pyogranulomatous pneumonia in Sweden in 1923 and was originally named Corynebacterium equi.\n406 Although it has been known as R. equi for several decades, the taxonomic nomenclature for this organism is a matter of ongoing debate, and the alternative names Prescottella equi and Prescottia equi have been recently proposed.407, 408 The conventional terminology R. equi will be used here. R. equi is considered to be a ubiquitous bacterium with a worldwide distribution,409 although a recent study suggests that it may not be present in Iceland.410 All isolates capable of causing disease in foals carry a plasmid encoding a virulence-associated protein (VapA). Although VapA is required for virulence, it alone is not sufficient, and other plasmid-encoded genes also influence virulence.349 Rhodococcal pneumonia is occasionally seen as a sporadic disease but is more common on endemic farms, on which there is often substantial variation in the incidence of disease on an annual basis.411 On endemic farms as many as one third of the foals are affected with clinical disease, and up to 50% of affected foals may die.412 The most likely route of infection in foals is by inhalation, and increased airborne concentrations of virulent R. equi are positively associated with the development of pneumonia.413, 414 High stocking densities of mares and foals have also been associated with an increased incidence of rhodococcal pneumonia.415, 416 Higher concentrations of R. equi have been detected in stalls and barns, as opposed to pastures and paddocks,417, 418 and this could lend support to the suggestion that dusty conditions are associated with an increased incidence of rhodococcal infection.419\n",

Dyspnea can be severe, with nostril flaring and prominent abdominal expiratory effort. Although relatively rare, some foals may present with a subacute, severe form of respiratory disease, consistent with ARDS, and severely affected foals may be found dead.429 Auscultation typically reveals diffuse crackles and wheezes, with prominent large airway sounds (rattles) caused by the accumulation of exudate in the cranial thoracic region. Rebreathing examination is typically not necessary because of the prominence of the abnormal lung sounds, and it is contraindicated in animals in respiratory distress. It is important to perform a thorough examination in affected foals, because extrapulmonary disorders are common.432 The most common of these are diarrhea, ulcerative enterotyphlocolitis, presumed immunomediated synovitis, intraabdominal lymphadenitis, or abscessation and uveitis.432 Arterial blood gas analysis is extremely helpful in assessing the degree of pulmonary dysfunction and should be performed before initiation of intranasal oxygen insufflation if clinically appropriate. Complete blood count, fibrinogen concentration, and SAA concentration are all helpful in characterizing the severity of systemic inflammation, and very high WBC counts, fibrinogen, or SAA concentrations, although not definitive, may be suggestive of R. equi infection.318, 319 Serial monitoring of these values can be helpful in assessing the response to treatment and in determining the duration of therapy.",

            "text": "Thoracic imaging is extremely helpful in staging the degree of pulmonary inflammation and supporting the diagnosis of rhodococcal involvement, and serial imaging studies can be very helpful in monitoring the progression of disease and response to treatment. Thoracic ultrasonography is readily performed and is very effective for the detection of peripheral pulmonary consolidation or abscesses, but it is unable to detect axial lesions unless peripheral lesions are present.349 Despite these limitations ultrasonography is the most widely used imaging technique in evaluating foals suspected to have rhodococcal pneumonia because of the combination of ready availability, ease of performance, and diagnostic utility. Abdominal ultrasonography should also be performed in foals with suspected rhodococcal pneumonia because of the frequency of abdominal extrapulmonary disorders. Thoracic radiographs provide more detailed information regarding the severity and extent of pulmonary disease, however, and should be considered in more severely affected cases, particularly given that reasonable image quality can be obtained with stall-side digital radiographic equipment.321 The radiographic abnormalities observed in affected foals may include a diffuse interstitial or alveolar pattern, tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy, intrapulmonary abscesses, and pleural effusion. A scoring system has been developed to assess the severity of alveolar pattern, interstitial pattern, tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and the number of nodular opacities and cavitary lesions in affected foals.433 Foals with higher median scores (\u226515) were less likely to survive (odds ratio [OR] 6.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35\u201328.2) than foals with a lower score, with only the severity of the alveolar pattern and number of cavitary lesions being associated with decreased survival. Care should be taken to avoid overinterpretation of imaging studies, especially thoracic ultrasonography, because many of the lesions detected may resolve without therapeutic intervention. A recent study on an endemic farm found that 80% of foals developed ultrasonographic evidence of pulmonary consolidation or abscess formation, but only 21% developed clinically apparent R. equi pneumonia.434 As a result of this concern a thoracic ultrasonographic scoring system has been used in several prospective studies of rhodococcal pneumonia therapies in an effort to more effectively identify foals that require treatment.431, 435, 436, 437, 438 This scoring system defines a pulmonary abscess as a focal hypoechoic area with a diameter of \u22651.0 cm, and the number of abscesses identified is recorded along with the diameter of each abscess. The diameter of each individual abscess is totaled to generate a total abscess score in centimeters, with foals that have a total score less than 8 cm or 10 cm typically not receiving treatment.",

            "text": "In foals suffering from respiratory dysfunction or respiratory distress there may be some utility in using bronchodilators to increase the airway diameter, decreasing the work of breathing and improving ventilation. The clinical utility of this approach is limited, however, because bronchoconstriction does not appear to play a prominent role in ARDS.457 The other factor limiting the utility of bronchodilator therapy is the risk that the resulting increase in ventilation may actually worsen the degree of ventilation/perfusion mismatching caused by increased ventilation of areas of the lung that are poorly perfused. To determine whether bronchodilator therapy may be beneficial, one can perform a bronchodilator response test under close clinical monitoring. Because of the risk of worsening hypoxemia, it is best if the foal is already receiving oxygen by nasal insufflation, but at the very least oxygen should be readily available in case of clinical deterioration. Administer a single dose of a short-acting bronchodilator, preferably by inhalation rather than systemically, and then monitor the response using clinical assessment and ideally with repeated arterial blood gas analysis.324 If the patient responds favorably, with decreased respiratory effort and improved arterial oxygenation, then it may be reasonable to continue bronchodilator therapy. Regarding the choice of bronchodilator, the methylxanthines (aminophylline and theophylline), although readily available, are not recommended because of their systemic effects and narrow therapeutic index.458 Generally, the use of the aerosol route is preferred; this targeted application allows for the use of smaller dosages, reducing the risk of systemic toxicity. \u03b22-Adrenergic agonists (albuterol and clenbuterol) are easily administered and may have additional benefits including enhancement of mucociliary clearance. Albuterol is inexpensive and the metered dose inhaler (MDI) formulation is most often used (Table 20.10\n). This drug has a fairly short duration of action of 1 to 2 hours. The anticholinergic bronchodilator ipratropium bromide (Atrovent, Boehringer Ingelheim) has a longer duration of action than albuterol (6\u20138 hours) and can be used alone or in combination with a \u03b22-agonist (Combivent, Boehringer Ingelheim). Ipratropium is only available as an aerosol preparation, either as an MDI or a solution for nebulization.",

Anecdotally, the two most widely used inhaled antimicrobials in horses are ceftiofur and gentamicin458 (Table 20.10). A variety of devices have been used to aerosolize these drugs, including jet and ultrasonic nebulizers, but the recently developed vibrating mesh nebulizers yield the most uniform and appropriately sized aerosols with a wide variety of drugs. The availability of a vibrating mesh nebulizer that is integrated into a face mask device specifically designed for horses (Flexineb, Nortev, Galway, Ireland) has greatly facilitated the ability to routinely deliver aerosolized medications in the clinical or field setting.",

Patients requiring mechanical ventilation typically are suffering from arterial hypercapnia and/or arterial hypoxemia. Treatment of hypercapnia, defined as a Paco\n2 of greater than 60 mm Hg, is fundamentally to increase the patient\u2019s alveolar ventilation by increasing the rate and/or depth of breathing. For initial therapy some clinicians will use respiratory stimulants to increase the patient\u2019s ventilatory efforts and try to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation, but if respiratory stimulant therapy is unsuccessful at resolving the hypercapnia, or if the hypercapnia is more severe (Paco\n2 > 70 mm Hg) one should consider instituting mechanical ventilation. Early intervention is preferable, because there is no benefit to the patient from prolonged hypercapnia and the duration of the requirement for mechanical ventilation is usually shorter with early intervention.",

Mechanical ventilation allows for much higher Fio\n2 than can be achieved with insufflation, up to 100%, dramatically increasing alveolar oxygen tension. Mechanical ventilation is also useful in terms of increasing minute ventilation through controlled respiratory rate and volume and in recruitment of alveoli for participation in gas exchange. An additional benefit is the decrease in the effort required for respiration, which can be dramatically increased in the face of pulmonary disease, which allows for a substantial decrease in the patient\u2019s energy and oxygen needs.

The first of these is the patient lacking normal respiratory drive, such as the obtunded or comatose neonatal foal, or the patient with impaired ventilatory effort, such as a patient with botulism. These types of patients are fairly easy to ventilate because the lungs are not diseased and pulmonary function is relatively normal. The prognosis for survival of these foals is excellent if mechanical ventilation is instituted early.469, 470 A fundamentally different situation is present in the patient with severe pulmonary disease resulting in respiratory failure, such as a foal with severe sepsis, ARDS, meconium aspiration, or severe pneumonia. In these patients the presence of pulmonary disease results in profound alterations in pulmonary function, primarily in the form of increased pulmonary resistance and decreased dynamic compliance, making these patients much more challenging to ventilate. The prognosis for survival in this population of foals is much more guarded. The decision to initiate mechanical ventilation can be an agonizing one because of concerns regarding prognosis, client cost, potential complications, and the intimidation factor associated with managing the ventilator. Unfortunately this can result in delays in the initiation of therapy that dramatically decrease the likelihood of a successful outcome. The development of some familiarity with the process of mechanical ventilation on the part of the neonatal intensive care team often results in a willingness to use mechanical ventilation earlier. Training sessions that provide familiarity with ventilator setup and initial settings are extremely useful, and so is a pictorial guide to setting up a circuit and attaching it to the patient.",

Invasive PPV relies on intubation for the establishment of an airway for gas exchange and aids in preventing the aspiration of upper respiratory secretions or refluxed stomach contents. Intubation is best achieved in the conscious patient by the nasal route, and this is easiest to do with the head fully extended. Nasotracheal tubes in the range of 7 to 10 mm outside diameter will accommodate most horse foals, and these tubes should be cuffed. The largest tube that can be passed through the upper respiratory tract without trauma should be used. Care should be taken to ensure that the tip of the tube is located in the cervical portion of the trachea, because it is possible to insert the tube too deeply, resulting in placement within a mainstem bronchus and ventilation of only one lung. After final positioning of the tube the cuff should be inflated with only enough pressure to maintain a seal during PPV, because excessive cuff pressure can cause tracheal injury and necrosis. The tube should be anchored to the patient\u2019s head to prevent inadvertent removal resulting from patient movement, and this can be done by tying a section of umbilical tape to the hub of the tube and anchoring the ends of the tape to an elastic tape bandage placed around the muzzle or to a soft cotton halter around the patient\u2019s head. Endotracheal tubes should be changed at least every 12 to 24 hours, because respiratory secretions and exudate will accumulate within the lumen of the tube, impeding gas flow and potentially causing obstruction of the tube. The presence of large amounts of pulmonary exudate may require even more frequent changing of the tube.",

Unfortunately the gases tend to cool as they pass through the tubing from the ventilator to the patient, resulting in substantial condensation (rain out) within the circuit that must be periodically drained. This effect is accentuated if the hospital environmental temperature is low. Alternatively a passive humidifier can be used, which consists of a heat\u2013moisture exchange (HME) filter device placed in between the ventilator circuit and the patient.469 These devices are effective with small foals but may not be adequate for foals over 70 kg and may need to be supplemented with a cold active humidifier in the ventilator circuit.469 The primary limitation to HME filters is that they tend to clog with airway discharge, which can result in obstruction and failure of mechanical ventilation.470, 471 For these reasons the author typically uses HME filters only for short periods of time, such as when first initiating mechanical ventilation, and relies on active humidification for the duration of ventilation.",

Although there are several different ventilator modes to select from, on most ventilators there are some basic settings that are fairly universal including Fio\n2, tidal volume, peak flow, and breath rate. Fio\n2 should be set to the minimum level required to maintain an adequate Pao\n2 but no lower than atmospheric O2 (0.21% or 21%). The tidal volume is the volume of gas delivered with each machine-controlled breath, and this should be set such that the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) does not exceed 25 to 35 cm H2O to avoid trauma to the pulmonary tissues. Peak flow is the maximal gas flow rate delivered by the ventilator during the inspiratory phase of ventilation. Excessive peak flow rates will result in overly rapid inflation of the lungs and high peak airway pressures. Low peak flow rates will result in an overly long inspiratory phase, resulting in a loss of synchrony with the ventilator, especially at high respiratory rates. Reasonable initial settings for these parameters are an Fio\n2 of 0.5 (0.3\u20131.0), a tidal volume of 5 mL/kg (up to 8 mL/kg), a peak flow of 70 L/min (60\u201380 L/min) and a breath rate of 20 to 30 breaths/min.469 These values may require adjustment once ventilation is instituted, and the response to ventilation should be closely monitored. Additional variables that may be controlled with the ventilator are positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which should be set at 3 to 5 cm H2O, trigger sensitivity (\u22122 cm H2O), pressure support (8\u201310 cm H2O), and inspiration:expiration ratio (I:E ratio = 1:2).",

SIMV is a modification of assist-control ventilation that still delivers a set minimum rate of mandatory breaths, which are rigidly controlled; however, the ventilator attempts to synchronize these breaths with the patient\u2019s inspiratory efforts if possible. The primary advantage of this mode is that it is well tolerated by the patient because of the synchronization of mandatory breaths with patient effort. In addition, SIMV ensures a minimum breath rate in patients with variable respiratory efforts or that are exhibiting periods of apnea. The limitation of SIMV is that the spontaneous breaths are not supported by the ventilator and require a large degree of patient inspiratory effort. Pressure support ventilation (PSV) allows the patient complete control over all aspects of the ventilatory cycle except for the pressure limit. In this mode each patient breath is supported by a preset assist pressure, which is stopped when the flow rate decreases below a set fraction of peak flow at end inspiration. This allows the patient to determine the size of the breath and the inspiratory flow rate, substantially decreasing the work of breathing. The risk of PSV is that there is no mandatory minimal breath rate guaranteed by the ventilator. The limitations of SIMV and PSV can be overcome by using SIMV with pressure support. SIMV provides a guaranteed minimal breath rate, and the PS provides pressure support of the patient-initiated breaths to overcome the inherent resistance of the ventilator circuit and endotracheal tube. CPAP is used to provide for a positive airway pressure throughout the ventilatory cycle. The pressure provided is typically the clinician-selected PEEP level. CPAP is often combined with PS to aid in overcoming the resistance of the circuit and decreasing the work of breathing.",

Over time the presence of PEEP will keep open the alveoli that are \u201crecruited\u201d during the inspiratory cycle, and this allows for gradual improvement in the functional capacity of the lungs. This can result in substantial increases in Pao\n2 and may allow for a decrease in the Fio\n2.472 By preventing cyclical alveolar collapse and reopening PEEP, the amount of shear stress-induced pulmonary injury may also decreased.472 The use of PEEP is not always benign, however, because it can cause compression of the intrathoracic venous system and impair cardiac return with detrimental effects on cardiac output. When first initiating mechanical ventilation it is reasonable to use PEEP in most patients, especially at moderate settings, because the benefits appear to outweigh the potential negative effects.",

Appropriate monitoring is critical to effective mechanical ventilation, and this cannot be overemphasized. The two most important aspects of monitoring are the assessment of pulmonary mechanics and pulmonary function. When considering the assessment of pulmonary mechanics one is really analyzing the interaction of the mechanical ventilator and the patient, and the three most important parameters are the driving pressure, the tidal volume, and the tidal airflow. The primary parameters of ventilator function and ventilator/patient interaction are the PIP and tidal volume (VT). These parameters are interrelated, because increasing pressures will be associated with increasing tidal volume in normal lungs within normal physiologic limits. In ventilated patients, especially those with substantial pulmonary disease, one will often find that this relationship is abnormal, with normal pressures resulting in inadequate tidal volumes, or excessively high pressures being required to achieve a desired VT. Continuous monitoring of PIP is extremely important, because sudden decreases may indicate a circuit leak, ventilator failure, inadequate gas supply, or a leak in the endotracheal tube cuff.469 Increases in PIP may indicate obstruction of the endotracheal tube caused by kinking or accumulation of exudate, bronchospasm, or pneumothorax.469\n",

Assessment of pulmonary oxygenation relies primarily on the measured Pao\n2, because the Fio\n2 is known. In the patient with normal pulmonary function there should be a linear increase in Pao\n2 with increasing Fio\n2, but this relationship breaks down in the presence of pulmonary disease caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatching. The presence of intrapulmonary shunts, resulting from the perfusion of poorly ventilated regions of the lungs, will cause the Pao\n2 to be lower than expected. A reasonable target for Pao\n2 is 80 to 100 mm Hg or slightly higher, because values above 150 mm Hg are not beneficial and are an indication to decrease the Fio\n2. The goal is to use the Fio\n2 closest to room air (0.21) that achieves the desired Pao\n2, and Fio\n2 values above 50% are associated with oxygen toxicity to the respiratory mucosa. Additional information can be derived from knowledge of the exhaled EtCO2 concentration, which is measured using capnography. The EtCO2 is representative of the Paco\n2 in patients with normal pulmonary function, usually with a value 2 to 5 mm Hg less than the Paco\n2.469 Decreases in EtCO2 indicate decreased pulmonary perfusion secondary to decreases in cardiac output or increases in pulmonary vascular resistance.469\n",

The provision of PPV, especially in the form of excess PEEP, has the potential to substantially decrease venous return, leading to impaired cardiac output. This is a serious concern, especially in the critical patient where cardiac output is often already impaired. The presence of an endotracheal tube has a number of potential adverse effects. First, the tube causes an increase in airway resistance because of its long narrow lumen and increases the work of breathing associated with spontaneous respirations. Second, the presence of the endotracheal tube results in a bypass of the normal protective functions of the upper respiratory tract and can allow access to the respiratory tract for pathogenic organisms. Infections arising by this route are termed VAP, and the likelihood of VAP developing is increased with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. The presence of inflammation secondary to the process of mechanical ventilation itself will also increase the likelihood of VAP, as will impairment of the patient\u2019s immune function associated with systemic illness. The organisms involved in VAP are often nosocomial in nature, which can be associated with a pattern of increased resistance to antimicrobials, complicating treatment of the condition.

PEEP is somewhat protective in that it appears to slow the development of pulmonary edema unless it too is excessive, at which point it contributes to overinflation and causes further harm.476 Atelectotrauma is caused by the repeated opening and closing of lung units during tidal ventilation and essentially represents a syndrome of low-volume injury resulting in the initiation of an inflammatory response.474 By appreciating that the lungs are susceptible to both high- and low-volume injury it is apparent that optimal mechanical ventilation is achieved within a fairly narrow range of tidal volumes and that this range may vary dramatically from patient to patient.",

By minimizing the degree of support, one can accelerate the patient\u2019s recovery of strength and stamina in the muscles of respiration (or minimize its loss) while also increasing the clinician\u2019s ability to identify when the patient no longer requires ventilatory support. Gradually decreasing the level of pressure support provided and increasing the trigger sensitivity level can accomplish progressive challenge of the patient\u2019s ability to ventilate on its own. Ultimately, however, the determination of readiness to be removed from the ventilator is a subjective one, and the question can only be answered by an extubation challenge. This is preferable to simply removing the patient from the ventilator while leaving the endotracheal tube in place, because the tube causes significant resistance to airflow and increases the patient\u2019s work of breathing. Intranasal oxygen insufflation should be provided immediately following tube removal in most cases, unless the patient has been maintaining normal oxygenation at an Fio\n2 of 0.21 while on the ventilator. Care must also be taken so that one is fully prepared to immediately reintubate the patient if the challenge is not successful and mechanical ventilation must be reinstituted. The primary endpoints of the challenge are respiratory rate, respiratory effort, and arterial blood gas evaluation, and some patients may fail within minutes while others fail over several hours. Several challenges may be required over a period of hours to days before one is certain that the patient is able be maintained without ventilatory support.",

The inability to perform a rectal examination beyond digital palpation can be a frustrating limitation, however. Just as in adults the initial goals of colic evaluation are stabilization of the patient and differentiation of cases requiring surgical versus medical management. Although most cases of colic in foals can be successfully managed medically, there are cases in which prompt surgical intervention will be required, and small intestinal strangulating obstruction is the most common.479 The presence of diarrhea is usually an indication that medical management will be sufficient, but this may be present in association with a surgical problem. Unrelenting pain that is poorly controlled with analgesics is a strong indication of a surgical problem, just as in adults. Severe intestinal distention on ultrasonographic examination, particularly caused by fluid or mixed fluid and gas rather than gas alone, may also suggest the presence of a surgical lesion.",

Colostrum feeding may be helpful in the expulsion of meconium because of the laxative effects of colostrum, but the lack of colostrum intake in a recent study had no effect on meconium release compared with foals fed milk replacer.482 If the meconium is not passed by 12 hours of age it will likely cause intestinal obstruction, typically at the level of the small colon or the pelvic inlet.481, 483 Progressive intestinal and abdominal distention will develop over the next several hours secondary to gas accumulation orad to the obstruction. Identification of the mass of meconium may be possible on manual palpation of the abdomen, but ultrasonography is a more sensitive and specific means of identifying meconium obstructions. In some cases retrograde contrast radiography may be helpful in confirming the presence and level of the obstruction and in ruling out other causes of obstruction such as congenital defects. Administration of an enema can be useful both as a therapeutic intervention and a diagnostic test and is indicated in all cases of suspected meconium impaction. Sodium phosphate enemas are widely used because of their ready availability in a premixed human preparation that is easily administered. Care must be taken to avoid hyperphosphatemia caused by excessive administration, however, and for this reason this type of enema should be administered no more than twice in the first 24 hours of life. Soapy water enemas given by gravity flow have also been frequently used, but because of the likelihood of rectal irritation and limited efficacy they should not be used repeatedly.",

Commercially prepared acetylcysteine enemas for foals are also available (http://www.scahealth.com/e-z-pass-foal-enema-kit.html). The foal is placed in lateral recumbency and restrained and sedated, if necessary. A 30-Fr Foley catheter with a 30-mL balloon is placed 2.5 to 5 cm into the rectum, and the balloon is filled, taking care not to overinflate. The acetylcysteine solution is infused using gravity flow to a volume of 100 to 200 mL and left within the rectum for 30 to 45 minutes.481 Because this type of enema does not seem to be highly irritating, this procedure can be repeated as many as three times, usually at 12- to 24-hour intervals. Additional treatments that are helpful in managing affected foals include IV fluid therapy to address any deficits and ongoing maintenance needs, as well as analgesic therapy. Butorphanol administration may be sufficient to control discomfort in many foals, but individuals with more pain may require flunixin administration to control their pain while medical management is pursued. Cases refractory to medical management may require surgical correction of the meconium impaction, but this is uncommon since the introduction of acetylcysteine enemas.481\n",

The most common congenital defects are atresia of the colon, rectum, or anus. Affected foals typically present within the first 2 to 48 hours of life and exhibit signs of acute, progressive colic and abdominal distention.338 In addition to signs of colic (tachycardia, tachypnea, recumbency, rolling, and anorexia), tenesmus may be noted. No fecal material will have been passed, and there will be no meconium staining noted in enema fluids that have been administered. Atresia ani is readily diagnosed on visual examination and digital palpation, whereas rectal and colonic lesions are more challenging to identify.491 Ultrasonography may be useful in demonstrating distention orad to the site of the lesion but rarely is able to characterize the lesion. Retrograde contrast radiography can be helpful in further characterizing the lesion and differentiating atresia from meconium impaction. Colonoscopy may aid in diagnosing lesions in the terminal colon and rectum. This procedure can be performed under standing sedation, and the use of n-butyl scopolamine bromide (Buscopan, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica Inc., St. Joseph, MO) has been shown to aid visualization.492 Ultimately surgical exploration may be the only way a definitive diagnosis of atresia coli can be made. Surgical correction of atresia ani is straightforward and typically successful, although anal sphincter function may not be normal.491 Atresia ani may be accompanied by penile malformations (hypospadias) that will also require surgical correction.493 Surgical resection and anastomosis has been attempted in some cases of atresia coli in which the lesion was accessible, but outcomes have been poor.491 This is likely caused by additional underlying neurologic and motility disorders and means that this condition should be considered typically fatal.",

Rotavirus infects the epithelial tips of the villi of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, but it does not affect the crypt epithelium.523 The virus replicates within the villous epithelium and is released following cell lysis, which results in destruction of the infected cell and desquamation of the villous tips. This leads to a loss of the normal absorptive capacity of the villi, but the secretory crypt epithelium is unharmed, resulting in malabsorption that likely contributes to the development of diarrhea. Villous injury also results in the decreased production of disaccharidases, particularly lactase, which may impair the digestion of lactose and contribute to the development of diarrhea by osmotic mechanisms. Other factors contributing to the development of rotaviral diarrhea may be the activity of viral enterotoxins, inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransport, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, and activation of the enteric nervous system.523\n",

            "text": "Clinically rotaviral diarrhea often occurs in large, comingled groups of mares and foals, and affected foals are typically from 5 to 35 days of age.535 Foals initially exhibit anorexia and depression, which quickly progresses to acute, profuse watery diarrhea. Affected foals may become rapidly dehydrated and frequently develop electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic acidosis. Although the morbidity associated with rotavirus infections is high, which is caused by the highly contagious nature of the virus, the prognosis for survival is good. Treatment is generally supportive and symptomatic, but IV fluid therapy is often needed to effectively address the fluid and electrolyte deficits. Balanced electrolyte replacement solutions are most effective given the frequent involvement of hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Severely affected foals may also benefit from a brief period of enteral rest (1\u20132 days), which necessitates the provision of parenteral nutrition until feeding can be reintroduced. Supplementation with lactase enzymes (Lactaid, McNeil Nutritionals, LLC, Ft. Washington, PA) at 9000 U (one tablet) PO every 3 to 8 hours may be helpful in improving milk digestion in foals that remain on the mare, or when nursing is reintroduced.503 The diagnosis of rotaviral diarrhea is by detection of viral particles using electron microscopy, virus isolation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunochromatography tests, and real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Of these the immunochromatography tests and RT-PCR are the most rapid and simplest to perform and provide high sensitivity and specificity.523, 536 Control of rotaviral diarrheal outbreaks can be challenging, especially in crowded environments because of the highly contagious nature of the virus, its persistence in the environment, and the resistance to disinfectants.523 Prevention can be facilitated by the use of maternal vaccination, which has been associated with a reduction in the frequency and severity of rotaviral diarrhea on endemic farms, and a conditionally licensed commercial vaccine is available for provisional use (equine rotavirus vaccine, Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI).",

Discerning the relationship between these organisms and clinical disease has been challenging because either or both organisms can be identified in normal animals as well as diseased animals, but both organisms are isolated significantly more frequently from foals with enterocolitis than from healthy foals.506, 509, 522, 537, 538, 539, 540\nC. difficile\u2013associated diarrhea (CDAD) is commonly associated with a history of antimicrobial therapy and likely represents the primary agent of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea (AAD) in foals.541 Spontaneous cases of CDAD can occur without exposure to antimicrobials, however, both sporadically and in outbreaks.509, 537, 542, 543 Additional risk factors that may predispose foals to CDAD include hospitalization, stress, dietary alterations or starvation, transportation, nasogastric intubation, and surgical or medical treatment.544 Clinically CDAD can be quite variable both in terms of the clinical signs and the severity of the disease. The primary clinical sign of CDAD is diarrhea, which may be watery or bloody, typically accompanied by signs of systemic inflammation and hypovolemia (hyperemic mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time, pyrexia, tachycardia, and tachypnea) and occasionally by abdominal distention and colic.545 Unfortunately these signs are nonspecific, and although CDAD may be suspected on the basis of history and clinical presentation, diagnostic testing is required for confirmation of the diagnosis. Because normal animals may carry the organism and these often represent nonpathogenic strains, culture is not useful for diagnosis of CDAD. Virulence of C. difficile depends on the elaboration of toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), and there is evidence to suggest that both toxins are important in the development of clinical disease.546, 547 An additional toxin, termed C. difficile\ntransferase (CDT), appears to play a role in virulence as well; CDT-producing strains have been associated with increased mortality in human patients.547 Confirmation of a diagnosis of CDAD is based on the detection of TcdA and/or TcdB in the feces of the affected individual, and this is most often performed using a commercial ELISA (C. difficile Tox A/B II, Techlab, Inc., Blacksburg, VA) or RT-PCR.524, 541\n",

Clinical signs are similar to CDAD, but because of enterotoxemia affected foals may show more pronounced signs of systemic inflammation and shock. Hemorrhagic diarrhea has been reported in some cases but may be transient in nature. Diagnosis of C. perfringens enterocolitis can be challenging, because the organism may be present in the feces of healthy foals. A positive fecal culture in combination with appropriate signalment and clinical presentation may be supportive, however, because healthy foals will generally shed very low numbers of the organism. Fecal Gram stain may also be supportive if it demonstrates large numbers of large gram-positive rods or spores. Commercial assays are available for detection of fecal enterotoxin, but they lack sensitivity.",

Broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage is indicated, even in situations in which AAD is suspected, because of the risk of bacteremia secondary to bowel wall inflammation and injury. Metronidazole therapy represents the primary specific therapy for clostridial infections, but metronidazole-resistant strains of C. difficile have been reported.550 A recent pharmacokinetic study suggests that the metronidazole dosing regimens used in foals should be revised to 10 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for newborn foals and 15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for the 10- to 12-day-old foal.551 After that age the current recommendation of 15 mg/kg orally every 8 hours remains unchanged. Additional therapies that may be of some benefit in CDAD include enterally administered adsorbents, such as di-tri-octahedral smectite.552 Probiotic therapy is of interest because of the positive results reported in human patients, but the limited studies do not support the efficacy of probiotics in foal diarrhea at this time.553, 554\n",

This disease causes dramatic structural changes in the mucosal epithelium of the small intestine caused by proliferation of the crypt epithelial cells. These alterations lead to a protein-losing enteropathy that can result in variable degrees of hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, ventral edema, lethargy, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and colic.561, 562 Diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy is by a combination of clinical signs (ventral edema), clinicopathologic abnormalities (hypoalbuminemia), abdominal ultrasonographic examination, immunoperoxidase monolayer assay serology, and fecal PCR testing for Lawsonia DNA.563 Treatment is best accomplished using lipophilic antimicrobials administered for 3 weeks, such as tetracyclines (oxytetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline), macrolides (azithromycin and clarithromycin), or chloramphenicol.564 Rifampin has been used in combination with macrolides but does not appear necessary to achieve a positive clinical response. Regarding prevention, unfortunately passively acquired antibodies have been demonstrated to have no effect on the occurrence of subclinical or clinical EPE.565 Promising results regarding prevention have been seen with the intrarectal administration of a commercial avirulent porcine vaccine against L. intracellularis, which has been demonstrated to result in complete protection against EPE and reduces fecal shedding.566 The prognosis for survival with appropriate treatment is good, but affected animals often exhibit a decrease in growth rate and as a result may be at a slight disadvantage relative to their peers for several months.560 Recent reports have detailed a more severe form of EPE that is associated with fatal outcomes, but these cases appear to be unusual.567, 568\n",

Despite this fact there has been substantial concern related to the risk of intestinal perforation secondary to the progression of clinically silent gastric ulcers, because this condition is fatal when it occurs.582 For this reason prophylactic antiulcer therapy has often been administered to clinically ill foals or those receiving nonsteroidal therapies. The efficacy of these prophylactic approaches has not been confirmed in clinically ill foals, however, and the response of sick foals to acid-suppressive therapy is less consistent than in healthy foals.583 Indeed, two large retrospective studies reported that the prevalence of gastric ulceration on postmortem examination of hospitalized foals was not related to whether or not prophylactic treatments were administered.578, 584 Unfortunately prophylactic acid suppression may be associated with some risks, and human studies have documented an increased risk of pneumonia and CDAD in non-ICU hospitalized patients treated with acid-suppressive drugs.585, 586 Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more potent inhibitors of acid suppression than histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and for this reason PPIs appear to be associated with a greater risk of these complications.587, 588 In human ICU patients there does not appear to be an increased risk of pneumonia or differences in overall mortality associated with acid suppression, but the use of PPIs is associated with an increased risk of CDAD.586 A recent multicenter study found that the use of acid-suppressive therapy in hospitalized foals was associated with an increased risk of undifferentiated diarrhea but not of CDAD.589 Together these concerns suggest that such use should be avoided and that treatment be limited to those foals with documented disease requiring treatment.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of gastric ulceration in the foal is likely complex and multifactorial and may differ between the squamous and glandular mucosal regions of the stomach. Within the stomach there is a constant interplay between protective factors and aggressive factors. The protective factors maintain a healthy gastric mucosa by promotion of mucosal blood flow, mucus and bicarbonate production, prostaglandin E2 production, promotion of epithelial growth factors, epithelial cell restitution, gastric afferent innervation, and gastroduodenal motility. The aggressive factors, which include gastric acid, bile salts, pepsin, and numerous enzymes, act to induce and potentiate gastric epithelial injury. As gastric acid production is highly variable in neonatal foals and the intragastric environment is often alkaline,583 it seems likely that ulceration results most commonly from suppression of the protective factors rather than from excess acid production. Perinatal hypoxia, systemic illness, or the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications may lead to gastric mucosal hypoxia or ischemia, impairing the local protective factors and predisposing the patient to mucosal ulceration. Ulceration may occur in the squamous mucosa, the glandular mucosa, or both, and may extend to involve the duodenum and/or the esophagus. The clinical syndromes associated with ulceration include subclinical, clinically significant ulceration, perforating ulceration, and gastroduodenal ulcer syndrome (GDUS). This scheme should perhaps be expanded to include gastroesophageal ulceration, although this is most commonly associated with reflux esophagitis secondary to GDUS-induced delayed gastric emptying. The classification of ulceration as subclinical or clinical may be challenging and cannot be based solely on the number and severity of lesions identified on gastroscopic evaluation. Instead, it must involve consideration of the history and clinical signs associated with those findings. The diagnosis of perforation may also be difficult and cannot be based on gastroscopic assessment alone because of the sometimes benign surface appearance of these lesions. For this reason abdominal ultrasonography and abdominocentesis are important in confirming the presence of perforation. The diagnosis of GDUS is based on gastroscopic evaluation combined with the presence of one or more of the signs of gastric ulceration listed previously, although signs of gastric-outflow obstruction, such as ptyalism and bruxism, are typically more common with this diagnosis.",

When gastric distention is present a nasogastric tube should be passed to extract the fluid and facilitate gastroscopic evaluation. Gastroscopic abnormalities commonly observed with GDUS include esophagitis, gastric squamous and glandular ulceration, pyloric ulceration, and pyloric stricture. Examination of the duodenum is usually not possible because of the presence of pyloric stricture. Treatment of affected foals is challenging and requires intensive management. Frequent gastric decompression is required, and parenteral nutrition is typically necessary because of the inability of the foal to eat. Supportive care including IV fluids, antimicrobials, and analgesics is also indicated. Acid-suppressive therapy is required, and this is usually accompanied by gastroprotectants and prokinetics. Although medical management may be helpful in resolving delayed gastric emptying, many affected foals will have severe fibrosis and constriction of the pylorus and duodenum, necessitating surgical correction. The goal of surgical correction is to bypass the pylorus and proximal duodenum, which typically involves gastrojejunostomy. Surgery is challenging, and success likely depends on early intervention, surgical expertise, and appropriate postoperative care.590 Reported surgical outcomes have improved over time, with the most recent report demonstrating 100% survival to hospital discharge and 50% long-term survival.591\n",

The acid-suppressive effects of the H2RAs are variable and less dramatic than those seen with PPIs, but these drugs may suppress acid production sufficiently to facilitate ulcer healing.592 Because of the more consistent and pronounced acid-suppressive effects of the PPI omeprazole, this drug has become the mainstay of gastric ulcer therapy in horses.593 Dosing for foals can be challenging, because there is no labeled form specifically designed for use in foals, but the product marketed for use in adults can be measured out on a volume basis and administered orally at a body weight\u2013appropriate dosage to foals. An IV formulation of omeprazole is not readily available for administration to foals that cannot take medications orally, but the IV pharmacokinetics of the PPI pantoprazole have been determined in foals.594 Other treatments include mucosal adherents, such as sucralfate, and oral antacids, such as aluminum hydroxide and magnesium. Sucralfate dissociates in the acidic environment of the stomach to sucrose octasulfate and aluminum hydroxide. Sucrose octasulfate binds to the ulcerated mucosa and decreases tissue exposure to hydrochloric acid and may also interfere with the activity of peptic enzymes.595 Sucralfate appears safe and is well tolerated and likely represents a safer approach for ulcer prevention in hospitalized neonatal foals compared with the use of a PPI. The prostaglandin E1 analog misoprostol has been used in an effort to enhance ulcer healing by increasing epithelial mucous secretion, bicarbonate secretion, and mucosal blood flow.596 Misoprostol may also enhance epithelial repair via closure of tight junctions following epithelial restitution of denuded regions of the mucosa.597\n",

The proposed etiology is that the fetus has a very full bladder, which ruptures under the intense pressures occurring during transit through the birth canal. Obstruction of urine outflow via the urachus during delivery may contribute to high intravesicular pressures. This theory is supported by anecdotal reports of bladder distention identified on fetal ultrasonographic examination in foals that subsequently developed bladder rupture after birth. There may be some sex predilection for bladder rupture, with colts being overrepresented in cases presenting shortly after birth, but in cases developing later there does not seem to be a difference between the sexes.612 Not all cases of uroperitoneum are associated with primary bladder rupture, however, because ureteral tears and urachal rupture can also result in uroperitoneum. Although ureteral tears initially result in urine accumulation in the retroperitoneal space, this typically progresses to uroperitoneum after several days. Urachal rupture may be associated with infection and necrosis of the umbilical remnant, and for this reason these foals may present slightly later than foals with bladder rupture.",

Some foals with uroperitoneum will present with ventral edema, although this is most dramatic in foals with umbilical trauma and associated subcutaneous urine leakage. Foals with retroperitoneal urine accumulation may present with stranguria before the development of uroperitoneum, and foals with urethral defects most often demonstrate substantial subcutaneous edema in the perineal region.

Azotemia is typically accompanied by hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and metabolic acidosis. Hyperkalemia is caused by the reabsorption of substantial amounts of potassium, whereas hyponatremia and hypochloremia are caused by reabsorption of water from the urine within the abdomen. These changes are likely more pronounced because of the milk-based diet of foals; milk contains relatively high concentrations of potassium (25 mEq/L) and is relatively low in sodium (12 mEq/L).616 Hyperkalemia is potentially life-threatening because of the possibility of fatal bradyarrhythmias. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed in all foals with uroperitoneum or hyperkalemia of any cause. Typical ECG findings in hyperkalemia will progress from peaked T waves and a shortened QT interval to lengthening PR interval and loss of P waves, followed by widening of the QRS complex, and potentially leading to cardiac arrest and death.617 Other potential cardiac sequelae associated with hyperkalemia include third-degree atrioventricular block, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular premature contractions. This classic pattern of electrolyte abnormalities is not typically observed, however, in hospitalized foals that develop uroperitoneum while being treated with IV fluid therapy with balanced electrolyte solutions.612, 613\n",

Not only can one confirm the presence of free fluid within the peritoneal space, but one can also assess the degree of fluid accumulation and investigate possible sites of urine leakage. The free fluid within the abdomen is typically hypoechoic to mildly hyperechoic, and numerous loops of small intestine or other intraabdominal structures may be suspended in the free fluid contained within the abdomen. The dorsal bladder wall is the most common site of bladder rupture, and this area should be thoroughly investigated because in some cases the free margins of the defect can be readily observed. It is important to remember that there may be more than one site of urine leakage, however, either from the bladder itself or potentially involving the urachus, ureters, or urethra. Although ultrasound examination is typically less useful when evaluating ureteral or urethral defects, it is important to perform a complete examination of the urinary tract to detect any defects in the kidneys or ureters that might be missed if only the bladder and urachus are examined. Contrast radiography may be required to identify sites of leakage other than the bladder or urachus.",

Creatinine diffuses poorly across the semipermeable peritoneal membrane, so the creatinine concentration in the peritoneal fluid will be at least twofold higher than the creatinine concentration in the serum. Abdominocentesis is both a diagnostically important technique and a therapeutic technique, because it allows for the drainage of accumulated urine from the peritoneal cavity. Removal of this fluid will aid in controlling hyperkalemia, and it will minimize further potassium absorption from the peritoneal cavity. Drainage will also decrease the pressure being exerted on the diaphragm and thoracic cavity, aiding in the resolution of any tachypnea, dyspnea, or respiratory distress. Abdominocentesis should be performed with a teat cannula or stainless bitch catheter or with an indwelling type of catheter such as a Foley or mushroom-tip peritoneal catheter. This approach minimizes the risk of trauma to the abdominal viscera and allows for safe manipulation and maintenance of the catheter while the abdomen is being drained. Care should be taken to administer appropriate fluid therapy before and during the drainage of the abdomen to avoid hypovolemia resulting from the removal of this third-space fluid. Drainage should be continued until surgical repair is performed, because premature discontinuation will simply allow for reaccumulation of urine within the abdomen.",

Correction of hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances before surgery is important in minimizing the risk of anesthetic complications. The most critical of these disturbances is hyperkalemia because of the risk of cardiac disturbances. Hyperkalemia is addressed by the administration of IV fluids that do not contain potassium, and isotonic (0.9%) or hypotonic (0.45%) saline solutions are most commonly used. Dextrose is typically added to the fluids at a rate of 5%, and this will aid in lowering serum potassium concentrations by encouraging movement of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment, but in severe cases the administration of exogenous insulin (0.1 U/kg) may be necessary to substantially reduce serum potassium concentrations. Sodium bicarbonate therapy may aid in lowering serum potassium concentrations and may be helpful in addressing the concurrent hyponatremic metabolic acidosis.617 Administration of calcium gluconate may also be helpful in decreasing the negative effects of hyperkalemia.617 Recent reports have suggested that the frequency of anesthetic complications during surgical correction of uroperitoneum is less common than previously reported, perhaps because of less severe electrolyte disturbances, better preoperative stabilization, or the use of safer inhalant anesthetics (primarily isoflurane).612\n",

Although this may occur immediately following cord separation, it is more typically seen several days after birth and is most often associated with umbilical infections. Systemic illness and the associated stress of handling involved in the management of sick foals may also predispose the patient to the resumption of patency. Patent urachus may present simply as moistness of the external umbilical remnant or may be associated with a streaming flow of urine. Urine scald of the abdominal wall and the medial aspect of the hindlimbs may occur secondarily. It is important that an ultrasound examination be performed in these cases to determine whether there are internal abnormalities, such as umbilical remnant infections, associated with a patent urachus. Conservative management consisting of topical cleansing of the external umbilicus and close monitoring for the development of infection is often sufficient, although complete resolution may take days to weeks in some cases. If any infectious component is suspected then appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated. Chemical cautery using silver nitrate sticks is often used and may accelerate closure of the urachal remnant, especially in early, mild cases. Excessive use of silver nitrate may result in local tissue necrosis, however, and may precipitate the development of infection. If conservative management fails then surgical excision of the umbilical remnants is indicated, but this is rarely a problem that needs to be addressed urgently, especially in a foal suffering from systemic illness or other disease processes.",

            "text": "Umbilical remnant infections are also common and can take several forms. Affected foals may appear clinically normal or they may exhibit signs of systemic inflammation (fever, leukocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia, and elevated SAA). Infection of the external umbilical structures will result in local abscess formation, which presents as swelling, inflammation, and often discharge from the area of the external umbilicus, but it can become more locally invasive, involving the body wall. External umbilical abscesses can often be treated with the establishment of drainage combined with appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy. Internal umbilical remnant infections can occur in all three of the distinct umbilical structures: the urachus (infection of the urachus is called urachitis), the umbilical arteries (infection of the umbilical arteries is called omphaloarteritis), and the umbilical vein (infection of the umbilical vein is called omphalophlebitis). It has traditionally been thought that umbilical remnant infections occurred secondary to external contamination of the umbilicus, with ascending migration of bacteria. This is likely true in some cases, and for this reason it is important to practice appropriate routine cleaning and disinfection of the external remnant. Excessive cleansing or treatment with caustic agents may actually increase the risk of ascending infection, so moderation is key. It is very possible that bacteremia occurs secondary to umbilical infections, resulting in seeding of other sites. Infection of remote structures, especially synovial structures and growth plates, has been frequently associated with the presence of umbilical remnant infections. Although the umbilical structures may represent the primary site of infection, it is also possible that some umbilical remnant infections actually develop secondary to systemic illness and bacteremia, rather than secondary to external contamination.",

Internally the paired umbilical arteries are found ventral and lateral to the urachus and bladder, and they course caudally and deep toward their origins from the iliac arteries. They are thick-walled structures and should have a diameter of less than 13 mm.621 Although the arteries may still be observed to pulsate in very young foals, they should contract down and be immobile by 24 hours of age. The lumen may be filled with clotted blood in some cases. The urachus extends from the apex of the bladder outward to the umbilical stump, and the lumen is typically collapsed and difficult to appreciate. A transverse view of the urachus and umbilical arteries taken at the apex of the bladder should normally measure less than 25 mm in total diameter.621 The umbilical vein courses cranially from the site of the external umbilicus to the liver and is located along the midline very close to the abdominal wall. The vein is a thin-walled structure and may contain anechoic fluid within its lumen. The vein should measure less than 5 to 10 mm in diameter.621 Infection involving these structures will typically manifest as filling of the lumen with material of variable echogenicity, thickening of the wall, and an increase in the overall size of the structure.622, 623 Thorough assessment is important, because multiple structures may be involved in the infectious process.",

In cases suffering from a combination of umbilical remnant infection and infections in other sites the clinician may feel a sense of urgency to surgically remove the umbilical remnants, but the stress of general anesthesia and abdominal surgery may be counterproductive. Stabilization of the patient and the institution of antimicrobial therapy before surgery may be beneficial in these cases. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is indicated, preferably using oral medications because of the need for prolonged therapy in most cases. The presence of gas within the internal structures on ultrasonographic examination or a fetid order represents an indication for the addition of metronidazole to the treatment regimen. In cases refractory to medical therapy, surgical excision of the affected internal umbilical remnants is indicated. Thorough ultrasonographic examination preoperatively is helpful in developing the surgical plan and may reveal areas of infection deep in the umbilical arteries or vein that may not be able to be surgically removed. Continued medical management may be indicated in such a situation, but marsupialization of the umbilical vein or arteries can be performed to allow for external drainage and possible lavage of the infected structures.624, 625, 626\n",

The most common of these etiologies is systemic disease, which has previously been termed vasomotor nephropathy, although the actual pathophysiology involved in these cases is not well understood.627 It appears likely that there is a complex interaction among systemic cardiovascular responses, local vasomotor tone, systemic and local inflammatory mediators, microvascular dysfunction, and local renal tissue responses that result in decreased renal function. This decrease in renal function may represent a self-protective response by the kidneys in which decreased energy and oxygen demands within the kidney may help to improve tissue survival and recovery.628 The most common toxic causes of renal injury in foals are iatrogenic in nature\u2014namely, aminoglycoside antimicrobials and oxytetracycline (administered as a treatment for tendon contracture).629 Nonsteroidal-associated renal injury is relatively uncommon in foals and is likely because these drugs are not commonly used in foals at this time, although this may change with increasing use of COX-2\u2013specific NSAIDs in foals. Other causes of toxin-induced renal injury are hemoglobin released because of NI and myoglobin released because of myopathies, most commonly white muscle disease.

Because of the substantial renal reserve, it is likely that substantial injury has occurred by the time changes in these markers are detected clinically. BUN is so insensitive that it is of limited use in evaluation of acute kidney injury in foals, but one should be concerned when substantial simultaneous increases in BUN and serum creatinine are observed. Serum creatinine, despite its poor sensitivity, remains the best biomarker for renal function in foals. Although there is tremendous interest in identifying more sensitive biomarkers of renal function, none has yet been characterized in foals. Interpretation of serum creatinine concentrations in neonatal foals is complicated by spurious hypercreatininemia, which can be caused by placental insufficiency or neonatal hypoxia.166 Although foals presenting with spurious hypercreatininemia had similar elevations of serum creatinine concentration compared with foals presenting with acute renal failure, serum creatinine concentrations in foals with spurious hypercreatininemia typically decrease by 50% within 24 hours of initiation of treatment and normalize by 72 hours.166 The most effective way of improving the sensitivity of serum creatinine is to become more critical about evaluation of changes in the serum concentration. Even though the values may remain within the published normal range, an elevation of as little as 0.3 mg/dL above baseline may be indicative of decreased renal function. Because serum creatinine may be elevated from prerenal causes at presentation, it is important to evaluate the serum creatinine concentration frequently to assess the response to therapy and detect upward trends as early as possible.",

Urine specific gravity is normally hyposthenuric (<1.010) in foals that are well hydrated and should increase appropriately (>1.012) in foals that are dehydrated. Isosthenuria (specific gravity of 1.010) may indicate a loss of renal function, but serial determination may be required to confirm the inability of the kidneys to dilute or concentrate the urine with changes in hydration status. Proteinuria is normally present in the first 24 hours of life but should then be absent unless there is renal injury. If the urine is alkaline, then mild spurious proteinuria (1+) may be observed on dipstick examination. Sick foals often will have acidic urine, making this less of an issue of interpretation than in adults. Examination for enzymuria has been advocated as an early indicator of renal injury in foals, primarily regarding urine \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT). This is assessed using the GGT-to-creatinine ratio (urine GGT/urine creatinine \u00d7 100), which corrects for dilutional effects. Elevations of the urine GGT:creatinine ratio above 25 are suggestive of proximal tubular injury, but this test does not have good specificity. Unfortunately elevations of the GGT:creatinine ratio are to be expected in foals receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy, and the magnitude of the increase is not well correlated with the degree of renal injury.634\n",

All efforts should be made to remove exposure to the potential initiating cause of acute kidney injury, if possible. Fluid therapy is typically indicated, both to correct any existing dehydration or hypovolemia and to induce diuresis. Carefully monitoring of urine output is indicated to be sure that the patient is not oliguric or anuric, and placement of a urinary catheter and urine collection system is extremely helpful in this regard. This may be difficult to achieve in the ambulatory patient but is readily accomplished in recumbent foals. Urine output in a normal 4-day-old foal is approximately 6 mL/kg per hour, but this value should increase in response to fluid therapy.632 Monitoring of \u201cins\u201d versus \u201couts\u201d should be routinely performed, with the goal of at least two thirds of fluid intake being excreted. If this is not achieved, then fluid overload is likely to develop. If urine output is inadequate after restoration of normovolemia and correction of systemic hypotension, then diuretic therapy is indicated. Furosemide appears safe and is well tolerated. In addition to its loop diuretic effects, furosemide may actually lessen renal metabolic demands by suppression of tubuloglomerular feedback. Recommended dosing of furosemide ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV q 8\u201312 h to 1 to 2 mg/kg every 30 to 120 minutes over 6 hours.185, 635 CRIs have also been used in foals based on dosing regimens developed for adult horses, starting with a loading dose of 0.12 mg/kg IV, followed by 0.12 mg/kg per hour CRI.636 If furosemide is ineffective, then osmotic diuretics can be used. DMSO is commonly administered to foals suspected of suffering from NE, and in addition to its free radical scavenging effects it does have some osmotic diuretic effects. Mannitol can be used as a more potent osmotic diuretic, at a dosage of 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg IV as a 20% solution over 20 minutes.185 If medical therapy is not effective, then renal replacement therapy (dialysis) can be considered. Hemodialysis is the gold standard therapy and has been performed in foals, but it is rarely available for equine patients because of the expense and lack of access to the appropriate equipment.629 Although typically less effective than hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and thoracic dialysis have been performed in foals and are much more feasible in most clinical settings.635\n",

            "text": "Activation of the HPA axis leads to increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. CRH is the primary stimulus for the production and secretion of ACTH by the anterior pituitary, whereas AVP acts synergistically with CRH to increase ACTH secretion. ACTH is secreted into the systemic circulation and interacts with the cells of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal glands, which subsequently produce cortisol. Cortisol is not stored in the adrenal glands; it is released into the systemic circulation immediately after it is produced. Only the unbound, or \u201cfree,\u201d cortisol is biologically active, and in the normal adult state the vast majority of the cortisol in circulation is bound to cortisol binding globulin (CBG), with much smaller amounts bound to albumin.637 Foals have been shown to have a much greater free cortisol fraction (58 \u00b1 8 at birth to 33 \u00b1 6 at 7 days of age) than adult horses (7 \u00b1 3) or human infants (32% at birth to 19% by 3 months of age).638 Increases in the free cortisol fraction can be associated with localized or systemic inflammation, because bound cortisol can be released from CBG by the neutrophil elastase.639 The concentration of active cortisol is also regulated at the tissue level by the action of two isoforms of the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD). 11\u03b2-HSD1 primarily generates active cortisol from inactive cortisone, whereas 11\u03b2-HSD2 primarily converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone.640 Unbound cortisol reaches the tissues by diffusion and enters the cell, in which it binds to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The cortisol\u2013GR complex then translocates to the nucleus in which it is able to exert both genomic (regulation of gene transcription) and nongenomic (protein\u2013protein) effects.309 In critical illness cortisol is important in supporting cardiovascular function, regulating immune responses, and increasing the availability of glucose as an energy source.",

These include the determination of neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios, basal serum cortisol concentrations, basal serum ACTH concentrations, ACTH/cortisol ratios, and ACTH stimulation tests that measure the ability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol (delta cortisol). There are a number of challenges associated with HPA axis assessment, however.641 The first is that the activation and response of the HPA axis are highly dynamic, with rapid changes in a short period of time and substantial variation even on an hour-to-hour basis. The second challenge is that measurement of total serum cortisol concentrations does not reflect the biologically active free portion, and determination of the active, free cortisol fraction is technically challenging, time-consuming, and not readily available in the clinical setting. The third is that the concentration of cortisol in the circulation provides no information related to the concentration of cortisol at the tissue or intracellular levels, in which it is active. The fourth challenge is that ACTH stimulation testing, either high or low dose, may not represent an accurate assessment of HPA axis function in critical illness. Finally, there may be substantial variation among cortisol assays, rendering it extremely difficult to compare the results of studies using different assays114 and calling into question the use of specific values of serum cortisol as indicators of HPA axis function or dysfunction.",

These findings are indicative of a decreased response to ACTH at the level of the adrenal gland, and this is supported by the fact that these premature foals also show impaired responses to ACTH stimulation testing.64, 91, 92 The neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio was noted by Rossdale et al. to be an easily determined surrogate marker for basal cortisol concentration in foals, with a ratio of <1.0 suggestive of impaired HPA axis function in premature foals, whereas a ratio of >2.0 was associated with adequate HPA function in term foals.92 Normal term foals also show some evidence of incomplete HPA axis development, however, because they exhibit impaired responses to endogenous ACTH and both low- and high-dose ACTH stimulation tests, compared with adult horses.64, 642 Following birth the serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations peak in the first hour of life and then gradually decline over 6 to 12 hours to levels lower than normally seen in adult horses.638, 643\n",

This renewal of interest was primarily the result of extensive work done in humans regarding the role of the HPA axis in critical illness.644 The concept of relative adrenocortical insufficiency (RAI) was developed and defined as an inadequate cortisol response for the degree of illness.645 RAI is considered to be a transient, reversible condition and has been associated with exaggerated proinflammatory responses in conditions such as sepsis, ARDS, and severe trauma. Potential mechanisms of RAI include suppression of the HPA axis at the level of the hypothalamus, the pituitary, or the adrenal gland.646 RAI has been associated in a number of studies with an increase in the risk of death in critically ill human patients.647 Subsequent studies using corticosteroid supplementation demonstrated a trend toward decreased mortality and improved vasopressor responsiveness, which further supported the concept of RAI in critical illness.648, 649, 650 The diagnosis of RAI remained challenging, however, because of the wide range of diagnostic criteria used in different studies. The most widely accepted criteria was a random total serum cortisol of <10 mg/dL or a delta cortisol of <9 mg/dL following ACTH stimulation.651\n",

            "text": "Several studies have been performed in clinically ill foals to determine whether RAI occurs in the septic foal. The first report of transient adrenal insufficiency in a septic foal was published in 1998, and the foal in that report had a low basal serum cortisol concentration and an inadequate response to high-dose ACTH stimulation testing.654 Gold et al. reported that septic foals had higher mean cortisol and ACTH concentrations than normal foals, and the septic foals also had higher ACTH/cortisol ratios than normal foals.655 Castagnetti et al. reported that nonsurviving septic foals had higher ACTH and ACTH/cortisol ratios at admission than healthy foals or surviving septic foals.656 Interestingly, Wong et al. reported no difference in baseline cortisol or ACTH concentrations or ACTH/cortisol ratios between normal and clinically ill foals.96 A small number of foals in that study did exhibit low baseline cortisol and ACTH concentrations or inadequate responses to ACTH stimulation suggestive of RAI, however. Hurcombe et al. reported that ACTH, cortisol, and AVP concentrations were increased in septic foals, compared with sick, nonseptic foals and normal foals.121 They also found that ACTH, cortisol, and AVP concentrations were higher in sick, nonseptic foals than in healthy foals. Some septic foals in that study exhibited low or normal serum cortisol concentrations despite an increased ACTH concentration, which was considered to be suggestive of RAI.657 Hart et al. examined a population of hospitalized foals and an age-matched population of healthy foals.97 They found that 46% of hospitalized foals had an inappropriately low baseline cortisol concentration, and 52% had an inadequate response to high-dose ACTH stimulation. A significant correlation was observed between an inadequate response to high-dose ACTH stimulation and both shock and MODS in hospitalized foals as well as a correlation with decreased survival in a subset of septic foals. Armengou et al. reported that nonsurviving septic foals have higher cortisol concentrations and ACTH/cortisol ratios than surviving foals.114 Although there are no reports examining the role of peripheral tissue corticosteroid resistance in the development of CIRCI in foals, a recent study performed in adult horses with SIRS found that decreased GR binding affinity was associated with nonsurvival and a trend toward an increased ACTH:cortisol ratio.658 Investigation of the role of peripheral tissue corticosteroid resistance in foals may be warranted.",

The use of baseline cortisol concentrations and ACTH stimulation testing is no longer recommended in human critical care patients.659, 660, 661 Similarly, there is currently no consensus regarding the appropriate diagnostic features of this condition in foals.662 Because of these difficulties and the increasing appreciation that it is not possible to determine the actual activity of cortisol at the tissue level, a new term was developed in human medicine: CIRCI. CIRCI is inadequate cellular corticosteroid activity for the severity of the patient\u2019s illness.309 The current recommendations in human medicine regarding the diagnosis of CIRCI are based on clinical criteria rather than diagnostic testing. Patients with hypotension refractory to fluid replacement and vasopressor therapy should be suspected of suffering from CIRCI, and they should be treated with hydrocortisone. The positive response to hydrocortisone therapy is potentially supportive of a diagnosis of CIRCI.309, 660\n",

            "text": "There is very little information available regarding the treatment of foals that may be suffering from CIRCI. The results of multiple studies in human patients have demonstrated that low-dose corticosteroid therapy in septic shock is associated with improved hemodynamics and a decreased requirement for vasopressor therapy, but it is not clear that there is a survival benefit associated with this intervention.663 Based on the experience in human medicine, it appears reasonable to reserve corticosteroid therapy for those foals in which CIRCI is suspected and that demonstrate fluid-refractory, vasopressor-resistant hypotension.190, 662, 664, 665 The potential role of corticosteroid replacement therapy may be supported by the recent study regarding factors associated with nonsurvival in foals with NE. This study reported that persistent hypotension requiring vasopressor and/or inotrope therapy was significantly associated with nonsurvival.666 Recommendations for corticosteroid therapy in foals are by necessity based primarily on the recommendations derived from human medicine, because no specific therapeutic protocols have been investigated in the foal.667 Current human recommendations are for the use of physiologic dosages of hydrocortisone. This approach most closely mimics normal corticosteroid dynamics rather than using high supraphysiologic dosages or long-acting drugs like prednisolone or dexamethasone.315 A 3.5-day course of tapering dosages of hydrocortisone (1.3 mg/kg/day divided q 4 h IV) in healthy 2- to 6-day-old foals was reported to potentially have beneficial antiinflammatory effects without any apparent adverse effect on innate immunity.313 The daily endogenous production of cortisol and the pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone have been studied in neonatal foals, and it was determined that an appropriate dosage of hydrocortisone for foals suspected to have CIRCI might be in the range of 1 to 3 mg/kg per day.314 This is slightly lower than the 2- to 4-mg/kg-per-day dosage (divided into two to four IV boluses per day) currently recommended in human medicine,309 and it has since been suggested that a reasonable hydrocortisone dosage for foals may be 1 to 4 mg/kg per day divided into four to six IV boluses per day.315 The appropriate duration of therapy is unknown in foals, but in humans it has been shown that early withdrawal of hydrocortisone therapy is deleterious, and prolonged treatment (7\u201310 days) with subsequent tapering of dosages is recommended.646, 668\n",

TRH then stimulates the thyrotropes of the anterior pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) into the systemic circulation. TSH regulates the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. The thyroid hormones are stored within the thyroid gland as the precursor thyroglobulin, which is cleaved to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) under the influence of TSH. T3 and T4 then enter the systemic circulation. In the circulation the thyroid hormones are bound to thyroid binding globulin and other proteins, including albumin. T4 has minimal activity and essentially serves as a prohormone. It is converted to T3, the primary active form of thyroid hormone, at the tissue level. Only the unbound, free thyroid hormones can be transported into the cell, in which they bind to thyroid hormone receptors in the nucleus and subsequently influence gene transcription. The effects of thyroid hormones are extensive but primarily involve increasing metabolic rate, enhancing cardiovascular function, and thermogenesis.643\n",

This approach is complicated by the age-related changes in these hormone concentrations that occur in newborn foals, as well as the myriad of influences of other nonthyroidal factors. The measurement of circulating concentrations is also poorly reflective of the activity of these hormones at the tissue level. Stimulation testing is difficult because of the lack of ready availability of TRH or TSH and is not practical in the clinical setting. In newborn foals thyroid hormone concentrations are substantially higher at birth than in adult horses.669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674 These elevated concentrations gradually decrease to adult levels over several months\u2019 time. Only a few studies have measured TSH in neonatal foals, and they found that the concentrations were not elevated; instead, they were similar to the levels seen in adult horses.674, 675 This suggests that the HPT axis is different in foals, perhaps because of increased activity of TSH or increased receptor sensitivity to TSH. This alteration in the HPT axis may account for the rapid growth of foals in the first few months of life and their high neonatal thermogenic capacity.669, 674\n",

A syndrome of congenital hypothyroidism and dysmaturity syndrome was first described in neonatal foals in Western Canada in 1981.676, 677 This syndrome is associated with thyroid hyperplasia (goiter), increased gestational length, dysmaturity, and numerous musculoskeletal abnormalities, including flexural limb deformities, rupture of the common digital extensor tendon, incomplete ossification of the cuboidal bones, mandibular prognathism, and incomplete closure of the abdominal wall.676, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684 This syndrome is also suspected to be associated with abortion in some cases.685 Thyroid hormone levels in affected foals may be low or normal, but the response to TSH stimulation is consistently decreased.686, 687 Although the etiology is unknown, this syndrome is suspected to be associated with exposure to some causative agent, and epidemiologic investigations have suggested increased dietary nitrate intake or exposure to mustard plants could be involved.643, 678, 682 Other potential risk factors could include inadequate iodine or selenium intake.682, 688 The prognosis for survival in affected foals is poor, and those that do survive are likely to suffer a variety of orthopedic abnormalities that render them unsound.680 Congenital hypothyroidism has also been reported in foals whose dams suffered dietary iodine deficiency or excess, and affected foals typically exhibit prominent goiter.689, 690, 691 In utero exposure of foals to endophyte (A. coenophialum)-infected fescue has been associated with clinical signs of hypothyroidism after birth and with decreased circulating concentrations of T3.32, 692\n",

This is also the case for the systems regulating energy metabolism in foals.700 These systems are very complex, involving neuroendocrine (cortisol, vasopressin, and thyroid hormone), somatotropic (growth hormone [GH] and insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1]), sympathoadrenal (epinephrine and norepinephrine), and pancreatic (insulin and glucagon) responses, as well as signals derived from fat stores (leptin and adiponectin) and the gastrointestinal tract (ghrelin).701 The somatotropic axis is stimulated by hypothalamic release of growth hormone-releasing hormone and inhibited by the release of somatostatin.702 The somatotropic cells of the anterior pituitary respond to these signals by increasing or decreasing the release of GH. The effects of GH are primarily mediated by IGF-1, which is produced by the liver and has similar effects on insulin when regulating blood glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and stimulating the uptake, utilization, and storage of glucose.703 The secretion of GH is stimulated by ghrelin and under negative feedback control of IGF-1 and leptin.",

The pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon are critical mediators of blood glucose concentrations, with insulin being produced by \u03b2 cells in response to hyperglycemia and glucagon produced by \u03b1 cells in response to hypoglycemia. Insulin has a multitude of effects, primarily focused on lowering blood glucose concentrations, and these include increasing glucose uptake in insulin-dependent tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue, increasing glycogen synthesis, increasing fat synthesis, and decreasing gluconeogenesis and lipolysis. Glucagon acts in opposition to insulin, primarily functioning to increase blood glucose concentrations by increasing glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, as well as by increasing lipolysis. The adipokine leptin is involved in the control of appetite, with increases seen following ingestion of a meal and with increasing total body fat, whereas adiponectin is negatively correlated with total body fat and has some activities similar to glucagon. Ghrelin mainly acts to increase feed intake and to stimulate GH secretion.",

The treatment of hypoglycemia in sick foals is of critical importance when it is documented and should be addressed by the immediate provision of nutritional support, either enterally and/or parenterally, as is appropriate to the individual case (see the later section Nutritional Support for the Foal).",

Tight regulation of blood glucose concentrations (between 80 and 110 mg/dL) was initially advocated in human medicine,714 but this approach has been shown to be deleterious because of frequent hypoglycemia resulting from insulin administration. A more permissive approach is now recommended, in which blood glucose concentrations are maintained between 145 to 180 mg/dL.715 This approach attempts to avoid the requirement for aggressive insulin therapy, minimizing hypoglycemic episodes, while also recognizing that stress hyperglycemia is a normal physiologic response that is important for maximizing energy delivery to noninsulin-dependent tissues, such as the brain, intestine, red blood cells, and kidney.716, 717 The primary goal should be the avoidance of severe hypoglycemia that exceeds the renal threshold, which in foals is likely to be above 180 mg/dL.718 Insulin therapy may be required to accomplish this goal, and various regimens have been described, including intermittent bolus administration or continuous rate IV infusions30, 643, 718, 719, 720 (see the later section Nutritional Support for the Foal). The institution of insulin therapy is not to be taken lightly, because it requires frequent monitoring of blood glucose concentrations and rapid intervention to avoid hypoglycemia until a stable blood glucose level is achieved, which may take several hours of fine-tuning.720\n",

Although our understanding of the role of these factors in equine neonatal critical illness is still developing, these studies give valuable insight into the complexities involved and provide some indication of the potential benefits of assaying these variables. Barsnick et al. reported that septic foals had higher glucagon and TG concentrations than healthy foals but found no difference in leptin concentrations between groups.709 Lower leptin concentrations were associated with mortality in that study, however. In a later study Barsnick et al. found that septic foals had higher ghrelin, GH, and TG concentrations and lower IGF-1 and glucose concentrations compared with healthy foals, and these findings are likely related to inanition and a negative energy balance.721 Sick, nonseptic foals in that study had higher GH and TG and lower IGF-1 concentrations than were observed in healthy foals. The GH:IGF-1 ratio was higher in septic and sick, nonseptic foals than healthy foals and was highest in nonsurvivors. This finding was indicative of somatotropic axis resistance in clinically ill foals.721 Panzani et al. reported that IGF-1 concentrations did not differ between healthy and sick foals but increased over time in all groups, whereas NEFA concentrations were higher in sick foals at some time points.672 Armengou et al. also reported that NEFA concentrations were higher in sick foals than in healthy foals but found no differences in TG concentrations between groups.114 Although direct intervention in the somatotropic axis does not appear to be indicated, 722 these findings support the importance of correcting the negative energy balance that exists in many critically ill foals.",

A number of types of rapid screening tests are available for estimating foal IgG concentrations, including glutaraldehyde coagulation, zinc sulfate turbidity, turbidimetric immunoassay, latex agglutination, and enzyme immunoassay tests, as well as serum globulin or TP concentrations.727, 728, 729, 730, 731, 732, 733, 734, 735 The ultimate decision regarding which test to use is based on the consideration of each test\u2019s accuracy, time requirement, cost, and ease of implementation.733 Several studies have indicated that serum globulin concentrations can be used to estimate the IgG concentration, but it appears that the cutoff points must be established in each individual clinical laboratory because of the variations in testing methodology.733, 736, 737 The enzyme immunoassay test is widely used because of its acceptable diagnostic performance as a screening test (high sensitivity), combined with simple performance and rapid results.733 The interpretation of the results of IgG testing has been the subject of tremendous interest over the past 40 years and can be a point of confusion because of the different diagnostic criteria and different test methodologies used over time. A recent report supported the traditional cutoff value of >800 mg/dL as indicative of adequate transfer of passive immunity (ATPI) and found that in a large population of hospitalized foals values <800 mg/dL were proportionally associated with mortality.165 This study also reported a regression equation that could be used to estimate serum IgG concentration from serum TP, albumin, and globulin concentrations with good diagnostic performance (IgG = \u2212241.4 \u00d7 [albumin] + 462 \u00d7 [globulin] + 222.8 \u00d7 [TP] \u2212 370.3).165 This estimation may be helpful in situations where specific testing for serum IgG concentration is not readily available.",

If the foal is known or suspected to have ingested inadequate amounts of colostrum, then early enteral administration of maternal or banked colostrum may be effective; however, such treatment should not be assumed to result in ATPI, and monitoring of serum IgG is still indicated.738 A clinically normal foal examined in the home farm environment may not require treatment if the IgG value is between 400 and 800 mg/dL (partial FTPI), whereas a value of less than 400 mg/dL (complete FTPI) represents grounds for treatment. If the foal shows any signs of clinical illness or is being examined in a hospital environment, then any IgG value of less than 800 mg/dL is an indication for treatment. Treatment consists of providing IgG supplementation, which most often is accomplished by IV administration of equine plasma, because test results are typically not available until after the time period in which enteral supplementation would likely be effective. The dosage for IV plasma administration is based on the severity of the foal\u2019s deficit, but it is not precise because of the tremendous variability in IgG content in commercial equine plasma.724 In clinical practice the administration of 1 L of plasma can reasonably be expected to provide an approximately 200-mg/dL increase in serum IgG.739 Unless plasma with a higher IgG concentration is used, it can be difficult to administer enough plasma to completely normalize serum IgG in severely affected foals because of the risk of volume overload as well as the expense of treatment, so the maximum initial dosage of plasma is typically 2 L.740 It is important to monitor the effect of treatment by repeated measurement of serum IgG to ensure that further treatment is not required, especially in severely affected clinically ill foals that may have ongoing catabolism of IgG associated with their systemic illness.740\n",

It is an immunogenetic disorder in which the foal\u2019s red blood cells are destroyed by preformed maternal anti\u2013red blood cell antibodies ingested in the colostrum. These maternal antibodies are produced in response to exposure of the mare to \u201cforeign\u201d red blood cell antigens by several possible routes, including placental pathology allowing exposure to fetal red blood cells during gestation, exposure to foal red blood cells during parturition, or blood transfusions administered to the mare.741 Blood group incompatibilities between the mare and the foal are caused by the foal inheriting a blood group antigen from the sire that the mare does not possess. These incompatibilities are likely commonly caused by the multitude of equine blood group antigens, with an estimated incidence of 14%, yet the reported incidence of NI is only 1% in Thoroughbreds and 2% in Standardbreds.122, 742, 743 This is because the majority of blood group antigens are not strongly immunogenic under these conditions of exposure. Some blood group factors are strongly immunogenic, and factor Aa in the A system and factor Qa in the Q system have historically been the factors associated with the majority of cases of NI.742 More recent reports have documented the involvement of other alloantigens, perhaps as a result of an enhanced ability to detect these other factors or because of differences in the breed composition of the local horse population.119, 744 The incidence of NI in mules is much higher than in horses, with estimates as high as 10% because of the presence in these foals of a donkey-specific red blood cell antigen (\u201cdonkey factor\u201d) that horses lack.745, 746\n",

Affected foals will initially have pale mucous membranes but subsequently develop icterus, although in peracute cases foals may die before exhibiting icterus.741 As the disease progresses foals will become dyspneic, and seizure-like activity may occur, potentially caused by kernicterus in cases with severe hyperbilirubinemia. Pigmenturia may be present, which is caused by severe hemolysis. Affected foals are anemic, although the magnitude of the anemia may be masked by concurrent hemoconcentration at presentation.119 Although most foals will present with hematocrits between 10% and 20%, the anemia can be severe, with hematocrits as low as 5% reported.119, 741 Thrombocytopenia may be present as well, and this finding appears to be more common in mule foals.741, 747 Venous blood gas analysis reveals decreased venous oxygen concentration and saturation caused by increased oxygen extraction at the tissue level. There is metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acidosis, which is caused by anaerobic tissue metabolism, resulting in increased lactate production. Hyperbilirubinemia, primarily caused by increased indirect bilirubin concentrations, is a consistent feature, although increased direct bilirubin concentration is seen in some affected animals, potentially caused by hepatic injury secondary to hypoxia or iron toxicity associated with bilirubin accumulation.119, 122 Increased SDH concentrations have also been associated with severe anemia (hematocrit <11%) in foals with NI, further supporting that hepatocellular injury occurs in severely affected foals.119 Hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria can be pronounced, and pigment nephropathy resulting in acute renal failure can occur in severely affected cases.",

This can be done using agglutination or lytic tests, with lytic tests regarded as more reliable.743 The hemolytic crossmatch of mare serum with foal red blood cells using exogenous complement is considered the test of choice. Identification of the specific red blood cell factors involved can also be accomplished by testing panels of red cells that represent all the known blood groups.741 Despite their limitations, agglutination tests are commonly used because they are more readily performed and provide more rapid results. A crossmatch of mare serum with foal red blood cells without the addition of exogenous complement has agglutination rather than hemolysis as the endpoint and is less sensitive than the hemolytic crossmatch. The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test can be used to demonstrate the presence of antibodies on the surface of the foal\u2019s red blood cells, but this test can lack sensitivity. The most readily performed test is the jaundiced foal agglutination (JFA) test, which is simple and provides rapid results. The JFA test is performed using red blood cells from the foal and colostrum from the mare, with agglutination as the endpoint. Unfortunately the JFA test can lack both sensitivity and specificity and is most useful in prevention of NI rather than diagnosis of an affected foal.",

Moderately affected foals primarily require supportive care, exercise restriction, and close monitoring. Stress should be avoided in handling the foal. If the foal presents at less than 24 hours of age then it should be withheld from nursing until the risk of further antibody ingestion has passed. This time interval can be difficult to assess accurately, but it should not exceed 24 hours because of waning maternal antibody content in the milk and decreased gastrointestinal absorption in the foal. Serial monitoring of the JFA test can be used, if desired, to assess the decline of maternal alloantibodies in the milk and confirm that the introduction of nursing should be safe.748 The foal will need to be provided with nutritional support during this time period, which is most readily performed using an indwelling feeding tube. IgG supplementation with colostrum from another mare or with frozen plasma will be necessary to ensure adequate passive transfer. Despite some concerns in the literature, withholding colostrum does not appear to have any deleterious effects on gastrointestinal development in foals.749 IV fluid therapy is helpful in supporting cardiovascular function and tissue perfusion as well as ensuring diuresis, minimizing the potential nephrotoxic effects of hemoglobin. Fluid therapy should be administered conservatively, however, to avoid hemodilution, particularly in more severely affected foals. Plasma exchange has been successfully used to treat foals affected with severe hyperbilirubinemia secondary to NI.258\n",

The decision to treat in these cases may be supported by findings of persistent or progressive tachycardia and tachypnea and demonstration of decreased mixed venous oxygen tension.750, 751 Treatment in these foals is directed at the restoration of the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and improving tissue oxygen delivery. Intranasal oxygen insufflation is readily performed but may be of limited benefit because oxygen saturation is typically not adversely affected. The only other way to improve oxygen delivery is by transfusion of red blood cells that will not be damaged by the maternal alloantibodies. The transfused red blood cells will likely only persist in the foal\u2019s circulation for a few days, but the goal of the transfusion is to provide support while the foal produces sufficient red blood cells to support itself. In the ideal situation a known Aa and Qa negative \u201cuniversal\u201d donor could be used, but these are very difficult to identify and not commonly available. In most cases the mare represents the most logical donor, and once her red blood cells have been washed to remove the alloantibodies present in her serum they can be transfused to the foal. The most effective way to wash the maternal red blood cells is by centrifugation, but this is often not readily available. Serial gravity sedimentations of anticoagulated maternal red blood cells using sterile isotonic saline to remove and discard the supernatant is readily performed and reasonably effective, but it does require a substantial period of time (several hours) during which the foal\u2019s clinical status may deteriorate. There are reports of the administration of polymerized bovine hemoglobin (Oxyglobin, Biopure Corporation, Cambridge, MA) as an alternative form of bolstering oxygen transport capacity. This is appealing because the product is shelf-stable and requires no delay in administration.119, 750, 752 These reports provide some conflicting evidence regarding the potential safety of this approach because the administration of bovine hemoglobin was associated with poor outcomes in some instances. It is unclear if this is the result of the product administered or a result of case selection, in which the most severely affected foals were likely selected to receive this therapy.752 When blood transfusions are used the volume of blood to be administered to the foal should be kept to a minimum; administration of greater than 4 L of blood is associated with the development of hepatic failure (OR 19.5).122 Reinforcing this concern is the finding that the administration of each additional unit of blood was shown to increase the odds of nonsurvival 8.4 times.122\n",

When performed in this manner the JFA test is reasonably diagnostic, and a negative result supports allowing the foal to nurse.748, 754 In the absence of JFA test results, any foal born to a mare that has had a previous foal affected by NI should be considered at high risk, and the foal should be muzzled at birth and not allowed to nurse for the first 24 hours of life.

Diagnosis of these conditions is based on the demonstration of persistent thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in the absence of other disease processes that might cause these abnormalities, such as bacterial sepsis. Foals affected by NAIT may appear clinically normal or they may exhibit petechial hemorrhages or prolonged bleeding from venipuncture sites. Foals with NAN are typically clinically normal, but they are predisposed to secondary bacterial infections that may lead them to exhibit clinical signs of local or systemic inflammation. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis requires the demonstration of antibodies bound to the patient\u2019s platelets (NAIT) or neutrophils (NAN). Direct fluorescent antibody tests, ELISA, immunoradiometric tests, and flow cytometry have been used to confirm the diagnosis.747, 755, 756, 757, 758, 759, 762\n",

This syndrome has been associated with an incompletely penetrant autosomal dominant mutation in the GYS1 gene, which encodes the skeletal muscle glycogen synthase enzyme.814 This mutation has been identified in more than 30 horse breeds, although at highly variable frequencies, with Quarter Horses and Belgians having the highest reported prevalences.814, 815, 816, 817, 818, 819 PSSM is rarely reported in foals because it remains subclinical, especially if foals are stall confined.820 The only indication of the presence of the syndrome may be increased serum CK activity, unless the foals undergo a period of exertional activity or are affected by concurrent disease. Typically the disease is not recognized until affected individuals are mature enough to be put into training or work.820 The clinical signs may range from muscle soreness and gait abnormalities in Warmbloods to progressive weakness and muscle atrophy in draft breeds, whereas Quarter Horses may suffer from acute exertional rhabdomyolysis.815, 821 Diagnosis in adults depends on muscle biopsy, but this may not be diagnostically useful in foals, and genetic testing is preferred.822 Daily pasture exercise and appropriate feeding of a balanced, low-starch, fat-supplemented diet to both the foal and its dam will likely be beneficial in management of affected foals.822\n",

Although they often respond positively when assisted to nurse or bottle-feed, intermittent hypoglycemia and seizures may develop unless they nurse regularly.823 Other clinical signs can include fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia, and because of this very nonspecific spectrum of clinical signs it can be difficult to differentiate these foals from those suffering from neonatal sepsis.824 Respiratory failure and sudden death can occur, even with only mild to moderate exercise.823 Clinicopathologic evaluation may reveal leukopenia; intermittent hypoglycemia; and persistent elevations of CK, AST, and GGT activities.822 Despite supportive care the condition is ultimately fatal, with most foals succumbing by 6 to 8 weeks and no reports of survival beyond 18 weeks of age.822, 823 A genetic test is available for diagnosis of this disease.801\n",

            "text": "Nutritional myodegeneration (NMD) is a noninflammatory, degenerative disease primarily seen in foals less than 30 days of age. It affects skeletal as well as cardiac muscle and is associated with low serum selenium and vitamin E concentrations.825, 826, 827, 828, 829 The primary deficiency of vitamin E and selenium appears to be in the mare, and for this reason NMD is most commonly seen in areas with selenium-deficient soils, forages, and grains.830 These areas include the northeastern, northwestern, mid-Atlantic, and Great Lakes regions of the United States. The clinical presentation of NMD can be acute or subacute. The subacute form is associated with muscular weakness, whereas the acute form is associated with rapidly progressive weakness leading to recumbency and death within a few days.831 Dysphagia is a common finding in the subacute form and is related to involvement of the muscles involved in prehension, mastication, and swallowing. It may contribute to the development of FTPI and aspiration pneumonia.828 Severely affected foals typically have involvement of the myocardium and the respiratory musculature, contributing to cardiovascular and respiratory failure and leading to death.822 Diagnosis of NMD is based on clinical signs in combination with increased muscle enzyme activities (CK and AST), decreased blood selenium, decreased glutathione peroxidase activity, and response to vitamin E and selenium treatment.828, 830 Profound electrolyte abnormalities may be present, including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypocalcemia, with hyperkalemia potentially contributing to cardiac arrest in severely affected foals. Myoglobinuria may be present, and pigment nephropathy can lead to the development of acute renal failure. Muscle biopsies may be supportive of NMD, but a more definitive antemortem diagnosis requires assessment of vitamin E and selenium concentration or glutathione peroxidase activity.828 Postmortem examination consistently reveals bilaterally symmetric myodegeneration with a dry appearance and pale discoloration of affected muscles. Treatment requires supportive care, IV fluid therapy for correction of hypovolemia, electrolyte derangements, metabolic acidosis, and diuresis. Dysphagic foals will require nutritional support, either by indwelling nasogastric feeding tube or parenterally. Vitamin E and selenium supplementation is essential in the treatment of affected foals (Table 20.13\n). The injectable form of selenium also contains vitamin E but at an insufficient concentration, requiring that foals also receive injectable or oral vitamin E. Although the initial prognosis is guarded, foals that regain the ability to stand have a more favorable prognosis.823 Prevention of NMD can be aided by ensuring that mares have adequate dietary vitamin E and selenium intake and by prophylactic parenteral administration of vitamin E and selenium to newborn foals in endemic areas.",

            "text": "The most common isolates encountered will vary somewhat based on the specific site of infection and the predisposing factors associated with the infection. However, when looking at retrospective studies of isolates from bacteremic neonatal foals some patterns become apparent. Over the past 30 years the most common bacteria isolated from blood cultures of infected foals have been gram-negative organisms.25, 123, 171 Gram-positive organisms isolated from infected foals represented less than 20% of isolates and were typically present in mixed infections with gram-negative organisms.25, 123 Although some of the variance in the patterns of bacteria isolated from foals may result from regional differences, it does appear that more recently an increase in the percentage of gram-positive isolates has occurred.177 Several studies have reported increased numbers of gram-positive isolates ranging from 30% to 43% of the total isolates.180, 181 This temporal change in patterns of isolates highlights the need to consider the likely pathogens present in the formulation of the initial empiric antimicrobial plan. Based on the most recent reports, E. coli remains the most common isolate followed by Enterococcus spp., Actinobacillus spp., \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococci, Staphylococcus spp., and Enterobacter spp.180, 834 Unfortunately there have also been temporal changes in the patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility observed in the bacteria isolated from bacteremic foals. Although there may be some debate as to the driving force behind these changing patterns of antimicrobial sensitivity, there is no doubt that the phenomenon is real. Some earlier reports mentioned the presence of a few isolates that were resistant to multiple antimicrobials,120, 177 but recent reports have demonstrated substantial numbers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms (up to 38% of isolates).180, 182 Definitions vary somewhat among references, but generally speaking, MDR organisms display resistance to three or more of the core antimicrobials in a sensitivity panel. Recent studies in human medicine have characterized the most common and problematic of the MDR organisms as the ESKAPE group, which includes Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.835 This group of pathogens is responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections in human hospitals, and all routinely \u201cescape\u201d most currently used antimicrobial drugs.836 The increasing prevalence of MDR organisms will require that antimicrobials are used judiciously and appropriately to limit the further spread of these organisms. The risk associated with these organisms also reinforces the need to perform appropriate culture sampling (blood, synovial fluid, CSF, body cavity effusions, etc.) to be sure of the pathogens involved and tailor antimicrobial therapy appropriately.",

Penicillin G exhibits good synergy with aminoglycoside antimicrobials, making it a useful drug in a combination therapy approach. Procaine penicillin is administered intramuscularly, whereas the aqueous solutions of sodium or potassium penicillin are administered intravenously (Table 20.14\n). Procaine penicillin G is readily available and inexpensive, but the requirement for repeated intramuscular injections makes it less desirable for use in neonatal foals because of their minimal muscle mass. Potassium or sodium penicillins are substantially more expensive than procaine penicillin on a daily cost basis but are commonly used in hospitalized foals with ready venous access. There are reports of administering potassium or sodium penicillin as an IV CRI, which can provide favorable pharmacokinetics with these time-dependent compounds.833 Toxicity is low for the penicillins and is primarily associated with adverse reactions to the inadvertent IV or intraarterial injection of the intramuscular preparation, procaine penicillin G, which likely represents adverse reactions to procaine rather than penicillin, although anaphylactic reactions have been reported.837\n",

First-generation drugs exhibit a primarily gram-positive spectrum, whereas subsequent generations have an increasing gram-negative spectrum and corresponding decreases in the gram-positive spectrum. Fourth-generation drugs are considered to be truly broad spectrum. The primary cephalosporin administered to horses is ceftiofur, which is a third-generation drug.842 It exhibits a fairly broad spectrum with an emphasis toward gram-negative coverage. Because of this spectrum of activity ceftiofur has often been used as the sole therapy in the initial treatment of foals. The relative safety of ceftiofur in foals has fostered this approach, because it allows the clinician to avoid using combined therapy including aminoglycosides. Unfortunately some recent studies have documented frequent resistance to ceftiofur in organisms isolated from foals, and there does appear to be a trend toward increasing resistance over time, especially among gram-negative enteric bacteria.180, 834 The use of ceftiofur sodium as a CRI has also been investigated and appears to yield suitable pharmacokinetics.843 Ceftiofur is also available in a sustained-release form, which contains CCFA. Subcutaneous administration of CCFA yields appropriate pharmacokinetics for highly susceptible bacteria in foals.844 Self-limiting diarrhea was reported in 66% of the foals treated with CCFA, but this does not appear to be a clinical problem associated with this drug. Repeated subcutaneous dosing of CCFA (13.2 mg/kg) at 48-hour intervals for four doses has been reported to maintain appropriate therapeutic concentrations in foals.845 Other cephalosporins may have utility in foals, such as cefquinome, ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime. Cefquinome is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that is labeled in Europe for the treatment of foal septicemia caused by E. coli, but it is not available in the United States at this time.846 Cefquinome is dosed at 1 mg/kg IV or intramuscularly every 12 hours, for very susceptible pathogens, but a higher dose of 4.5 mg/kg IV every 12 hours is indicated when dealing with pathogens with higher MIC values.847 Cefpodoxime proxetil is a third-generation drug that is administered orally, but unfortunately the expense of this drug renders it of limited utility in most cases.833 Cefepime is a fourth-generation drug that can be useful in the management of MDR infections.848\n",

The primary reasons for this are that the aminoglycosides are bactericidal, exhibit primarily a gram-negative spectrum, and demonstrate good synergy with \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials.634 The bacterial penetration of aminoglycosides is in part an oxygen-dependent transport process and partially accomplished by passive diffusion. This dependence on oxygen-driven transport renders anaerobes resistant to the aminoglycosides. The role of passive diffusion leads to a dependence on high tissue concentrations of the drug to achieve high intracellular concentrations. Routes of administration and/or dosage schedules associated with high peak concentrations at the site of infection, such as extended-interval dosing, are associated with improved clinical responses.849 Prolonged treatment intervals decrease the risk of nephrotoxicity while still demonstrating clinical efficacy caused by the prolongation of bacterial killing, even after the aminoglycoside concentration drops below the MIC for the targeted organism. This phenomenon is termed the postantibiotic effect. The use of extended interval dosing also has been demonstrated to lessen the development of both acquired and adaptive antimicrobial resistance, which are caused by the high peak concentrations achieved and the period of time during which the drug is below the MIC.634\n",

A recent study examining the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin in foals indicated that gentamicin should be dosed at 12 mg/kg IV every 36 hours in foals less than 2 weeks of age, whereas a lower dose of 6.6 mg/kg IV every 24 hours was estimated to be adequate in foals 2 weeks of age or older.850 Because of the unpredictability of aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics in sick foals, it is recommended that therapeutic drug monitoring be performed to ensure that both an adequate peak serum concentration is achieved as well as appropriate trough concentrations. Peak serum concentrations are typically monitored at 30 minutes after administration of the IV dose, and trough concentrations are monitored immediately before the subsequent dose. This approach is effective but may lack sensitivity in detecting impaired clearance of the drug. In addition, because of the timing of the sample collection the results of the assay will not be available until after the administration of the next dose, which may delay adjustment of the dosage or interval, if indicated. An alternative approach is to obtain serum samples at 30 minutes and 8 hours after drug administration, which can allow for estimation of drug clearance in a more timely manner, allowing for more rapid adjustment of the therapeutic protocol.634\n",

Because the tetracyclines are primarily eliminated via the urinary tract, there is the risk for toxicity in animals with renal insufficiency. Very large dosages of oxytetracycline are administered to foals suffering from tendon contracture, and repeated or injudicious administration has been associated with nephrotoxicity.629 Rapid IV injection of oxytetracycline has been associated with collapse in horses, perhaps caused by chelation of calcium in the blood. For this reason oxytetracycline is administered at 6 to 8 mg/kg slowly IV twice daily, usually diluted in 0.5 to 1 L of normal saline and administered over 30 minutes. Doxycycline is no longer widely used because of decreased availability and increased expense. Minocycline has come into widespread use in horses because of superior pharmacokinetics compared with doxycycline and a much more reasonable cost of treatment.

Rifampin therapy is typically administered in conjunction with the macrolides in the treatment of rhodococcal pneumonia because of its potential synergistic effects. The combination of clarithromycin-rifampin has been shown to be more effective than erythromycin-rifampin or azithromycin-rifampin in the treatment of rhodococcal pneumonia.441 Despite decades of clinical experience supporting the efficacy of the combination of macrolides and rifampin, there is recent evidence that coadministration of rifampin with macrolides substantially inhibits macrolide absorption.444, 445 Current recommendations support the continued use of macrolide-rifampin combinations in the treatment of rhodococcal pneumonia in foals.349 There has been recent interest in the use of the macrolide gamithromycin in foals because this drug exhibits favorable pharmacokinetics in foals following once-weekly intramuscular injections. It also has been shown to be noninferior to the combination of azithromycin and rifampin in the treatment of rhodococcal pneumonia in foals.435, 443\n",

The half-life of chloramphenicol is short, and it is a time-dependent drug, requiring frequent dosing (6-hour intervals).853 Human health concerns regarding possible chloramphenicol-associated nondose-dependent fatal aplastic anemia made it illegal to use this drug in food animals over the past 50 to 60 years. As a result of the minimal use of the drug there are low levels of resistance to chloramphenicol in many types of bacteria, which has created a potentially important role for chloramphenicol in the treatment of MDR organisms. Intriguingly, the usage of chloramphenicol has been proposed for human patients infected with MDR organisms, despite the risk of aplastic anemia.854 Regardless, the potential risk of aplastic anemia to humans handling chloramphenicol necessitates thorough client education when dispensing this drug (avoid contact with aerosolized drug or direct contact with mucous membranes). Animal toxicity appears to be rare and is associated with reversible or irreversible bone marrow suppression. Florfenicol is closely related to chloramphenicol but has not been associated with aplastic anemia in humans and is labeled for use in food animals. Administration of florfenicol to adult horses has been associated with acute colitis and is contraindicated, but this has not been reported in foals. There are anecdotal reports of successful clinical use of florfenicol in foals at 24- to 48-hour dosing intervals; however, a recent pharmacokinetic study suggested that a shorter treatment interval of 10 hours may be appropriate.833, 855\n",

            "text": "The first challenge in patient evaluation is the accurate assessment of hydration status. The typical parameters used in assessing clinical hydration during a physical examination are mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, jugular refill time, pulse quality, the temperature of the extremities, mental status, and urine production. Fundamentally these represent indicators of perfusion, rather than hydration, which is an important distinction given that there are situations, such as cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock, in which a well-hydrated patient can present with extremely poor perfusion. The term dehydration actually refers to situations in which there is a total body deficit of pure water. The clinical signs most commonly used for the assessment of dehydration are increased skin turgor, tacky mucous membranes, and sunken eyes. Unfortunately skin turgor is difficult to assess in foals, and a recent study in adult horses indicated that it was also not a reliable estimator of clinical hydration status in that population.858 Further insight into hydration status can be gained by the measurement of urine specific gravity, which in the properly hydrated foal should be in the range of 1.010 to 1.001. Values greater than 1.010 indicate that the foal is retaining water and is likely not adequately hydrated. Urine output is another useful parameter, but it can be hard to gauge in foals that are not continuously monitored. The normal foal should urinate at least once every 2 hours. More accurate assessment of urine output is only possible in foals that have a urinary catheter in place, allowing for urine collection and measurement. Urine output should be greater than approximately two thirds of the total fluid intake including all IV infusions and any enteral fluids or feeding. Hypotension, considered a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 60 mm Hg, may be an indication of hypovolemia but can also result from decreased cardiac output or excessive venous capacitance. If the hypotensive patient does not respond to volume replacement then additional therapy in the form of vasopressors and/or inotropes is indicated (see the later section Inotrope and Vasopressor Therapy).",

Neonatal foals have substantially higher total body water (TBW) content than adult horses, at 75% and 67%, respectively.859 TBW is present in two primary compartments, the intracellular fluid (ICF) and ECF, with the ECF subdivided into the interstitial fluid and the plasma volume. In neonatal foals the ECF and ICF each represent approximately half of the TBW, and the plasma volume represents approximately one fourth of the ECF.859 TBW is primarily determined by the total body sodium content, which is closely related to the sodium concentration within the ECF compartment and regulated by the ingestion or elimination of sodium.860 Decreases in the plasma sodium concentration (hyponatremia) are indicative of a relative excess of free water and/or decreases in total body sodium content. The kidneys will respond by eliminating water while retaining sodium, restoring normal sodium concentration and TBW content. Increases in the plasma sodium concentration represent a loss of free water and will stimulate thirst, leading to water ingestion and correction of the TBW deficit.",

Oxygen-carrying solutions contain either red blood cells or other substances capable of delivering oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.

Sodium overload can result in hypernatremia, which has been associated with increased mortality and severity of illness in human patients.861 In addition to the substantial sodium content of the isotonic electrolyte solutions, there is typically a substantial chloride content as well. This is most pronounced with isotonic saline (0.9%), which contains 154 mEq/L of both sodium and chloride (Table 20.15\n). Although the sodium content is only slightly supraphysiologic, the chloride content is dramatically greater than that present normally in the plasma. In some patients renal elimination of chloride is impaired and is not adequate to deal with this high chloride load.862 Excessive chloride administration is associated with the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, inflammation, hypotension, and adverse renal outcomes in human patients.861 More physiologic fluids, such as lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (LRS), Plasma-Lyte A, and Normosol-R, contain lower concentrations of chloride more closely mimicking normal serum concentrations.

There are concerns that the administration of hypotonic fluids could cause red blood cell lysis, and for this reason maintenance fluids often have dextrose added to bring the tonicity of the solution into a more appropriate physiologic range. Following administration the dextrose is metabolized and has no impact on fluid shifts within the body. The use of 5% dextrose in water (D5W) represents an alternative to hypotonic crystalloid fluids for maintenance therapy in foals; this solution will not contribute any sodium load because there are no electrolytes. This is problematic because there is an ongoing need for electrolytes caused by renal, gastrointestinal, and insensible losses. For this reason D5W should not be used alone and is typically combined with isotonic polyionic crystalloid solutions to provide for replacement of any electrolyte deficits as well as ongoing losses.",

This allows them to exert colloid oncotic pressure within the circulation, resulting in fluid shifts from the interstitium into the vasculature and expanding circulating blood volume. Colloids will also aid in retaining fluids that have been administered within the vasculature for a longer period of time than would be possible with crystalloids alone. The most commonly used colloid solution is fresh frozen equine plasma, which contains albumin as the primary colloid. Albumin, while the most physiologic colloid, also has a relatively small size and will diffuse into the interstitial fluid space in which it will then exert a colloidal effect, potentially exacerbating the development of edema. Blood is another natural colloid. In addition to the colloidal effect of the albumin that it contains, blood has the benefit of providing red blood cells to improve oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue oxygen delivery. Another solution with oxygen-carrying capacity is ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin. This product has colloidal effects, but they are not the primary reason that this product would be used. Polymerized hemoglobin has been used with apparent clinical efficacy in foals and horses at doses of 2 to 5 mL/kg.750, 752 This product is not currently available in the United States, but it is available in Europe (Oxyglobin, Dechra Veterinary Products, Shrewsbury, UK).",

There are concerns that synthetic colloids, especially hetastarch, may interfere with coagulation, especially in patients with severe systemic inflammation that may already be suffering from subclinical coagulative dysfunction. New-generation hetastarch preparations have lower molecular weight and lower degrees of molar substitution and may have improved safety profiles.864 Of even greater concern is the recent evidence from human medicine that resuscitation with hetastarch solutions may be associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury and mortality.865 Although there are no studies addressing these concerns, in veterinary patients it is recommended that hetastarch solutions should only be used in patients with a demonstrated need for colloid therapy, and potentially in combination with equine plasma, rather than as the primary resuscitation fluid or the sole colloid.

The most physiologic route is the enteral route, but it can be easy to overlook the utility of this route, especially in hospitalized patients. Generally, if the gut is working it should be used for at least whatever component of the fluid therapy is appropriate. Enteral administration will be limited in both the volume that can be delivered and the rate at which the fluid will be absorbed, rendering it of limited utility in the critically ill patient, but it may be very useful in delivering maintenance fluid therapy. Enteral therapy may also be less expensive and more practical in the field setting when treating the less severely compromised patient. IV administration will achieve the most rapid results because it allows for the rapid administration of large amounts of fluids and is the most commonly used route of administration in critically ill patients. IV access is associated with some risks, primarily catheter-associated complications such as thrombophlebitis and air embolus aspiration.

IV access can be challenging to establish in the sick neonatal foal, especially in a field setting. Although over-the-stylet catheters are commonly used, they can be difficult to place in hypotensive foals and are susceptible to kinking or displacement caused by foal movement and frequent handling. These catheters are best used for short-term fluid administration in normotensive foals. The most commonly used over-the-stylet catheters are made of Teflon, which can be more irritating to the vein than other materials, but polyurethane over-the-stylet catheters also are available (MILA International, Inc., Erlanger, KY; Arrow, Teleflex Inc., Wayne, PA). Over-the-wire catheters, although slightly more complex regarding placement, are easier to use in hypotensive patients and are easier to maintain for longer periods of time. These catheters are typically made of polyurethane, which is less thrombogenic than Teflon. Silicone over-the-wire catheters are the least thrombogenic and are rarely used in foals. Over-the-wire catheters are also available in longer lengths (20 cm) than over-the-stylet catheters (13 cm), which is helpful in critically ill foals because they can be placed almost as deep as a central venous line, potentially decreasing the risk of vascular irritation associated with delivery of hypertonic solutions or irritating medications. Multiple-lumen over-the-wire catheters are available that can be helpful in critically ill patients because they allow for parenteral nutrition or medications to be delivered through a separate catheter lumen than the one used for IV fluid administration. The downside to these multilumen catheters is primarily their large outer diameter, which can make them more challenging to place and may increase the risk of catheter site or vascular complications.",

Leaving the nasogastric tube in place is also problematic because of local irritation within the pharynx and interference with voluntary drinking and eating. If repeated enteral administration is anticipated, then serious consideration should be given to the placement of an indwelling enteral feeding tube (14 Fr \u00d7 125 cm, MILA International, Inc., Erlanger, KY). The small outer diameter of these tubes allows for ongoing voluntary intake of feed or water. Having one of these tubes in place makes it very simple to administer multiple small boluses of enteral fluids or milk with minimal patient stress.

            "text": "The clinician must also determine the volume of fluids to be administered and the duration of fluid therapy. The factors that must be considered in determining the amount of fluids to administer are the volume needed for maintenance of normal bodily function, the magnitude of the existing fluid deficit, and the ongoing losses potentially associated with the disease process (diarrhea, reflux) as well as any insensible losses (sweat). When designing the fluid therapy plan it is important to consider the maintenance fluid plan as separate from the replacement fluid plan, which includes both replacement of existing deficits and ongoing losses. The types of fluids used for these purposes are typically different, and inadvertent use of maintenance fluids for replacement, or vice versa, can be deleterious to the patient. The calculation of maintenance fluid requirements in the foal can be approached in two ways. The traditional approach is based on the accepted value of 3 to 5 mL/kg per hour (75\u2013120 mL/kg/day) as the maintenance fluid requirement. The primary problem with this approach is that it represents a very broad range of fluid rates and may result in fluid overload if not closely monitored. A second approach to the determination of maintenance fluid requirements has been proposed, based on the Holliday\u2013Segar formula, which provides a \u201cdrier,\u201d more conservative rate of fluid administration. The calculation is as follows: for the first 10 kg of body weight, 100 mL/kg per day of fluids are administered, then 50 mL/kg per day for each kilogram from 11 to 20 kg body weight, and then 25 mL/kg per day for each kilogram of body weight >20 kg.190, 866 In a 50-kg foal this calculation yields a maintenance rate of 2250 mL/day, or 94 mL/h, which equates to 1.9 mL/kg per hour.866 When formulating the fluid plan do not forget to incorporate other fluid sources that may be administered to the foal, which includes any enteral feedings, as well as fluids given as drug infusions or parenteral nutrition. It is easy to overlook these additional sources, yet they may constitute a significant proportion of the daily fluid intake.",

If isotonic replacement solutions are administered for maintenance purposes, then hypernatremia and hyperchloremia are likely complications.863 Those solutions also contain inadequate amounts of potassium for maintenance. The use of hypotonic crystalloid maintenance solutions is, therefore, more appropriate. The recommended daily rate of sodium supplementation in foals is less than 3 mEq/kg, unless they have increased renal sodium losses.866 Administration of a maintenance solution such as Plasma-Lyte 56 at 1.9 mL/kg per hour will provide approximately 2 mEq/kg per day of sodium. It is important to remember that the foal will likely be receiving other sources of sodium in the form of drug infusions and catheter flushes and in solutions such as parenteral nutrition, plasma, or synthetic colloids. Regarding potassium, the daily maintenance requirements are quite substantial in foals that are not nursing because milk contains high levels of potassium. Supplementation of potassium at 1 to 3 mEq/kg per day is a reasonable starting point. Hypotonic maintenance solutions, such as Plasma-Lyte 56, contain substantially more potassium than replacement solutions (13 mEq/L vs. 5 mEq/L, respectively), but this is still insufficient for the neonatal foal, and supplementation will be required. The addition of potassium chloride at 20 to 40 mEq/L to a hypotonic maintenance solution is a reasonable starting point for supplementation. Care should be taken not to administer a fluid with that amount of potassium supplementation at a high rate, however, because administration of potassium at a rate greater than 0.5 mEq/kg per hour may result in cardiac complications caused by hyperkalemia.\n",

This approach yields estimates of dehydration ranging from 5% to >10%, and these values can be used when calculating the estimated fluid deficit. For example, a 50-kg foal with a clinical estimate of 5% dehydration will require 2.5 L of fluids (50 kg \u00d7 0.05 = 2.5 kg of fluid) to replace their deficit. Clinicopathologic testing can aid in refining the estimate of the fluid deficit, with variables such as packed cell volume, total plasma protein concentration, urine specific gravity, BUN concentration, serum creatinine concentration, and serum lactate concentration all potentially providing useful insight (Table 20.17\n). The packed cell volume will be increased with hypovolemia but may show less marked elevations with dehydration. Total protein concentration will typically increase with hypovolemia and dehydration as well, but this marker may lack sensitivity in patients with hypoalbuminemia and/or hypoglobulinemia. Urine specific gravity is a fairly sensitive marker of dehydration and is very clinically useful. BUN and creatinine concentrations are indicators of hypovolemia and decreased perfusion rather than dehydration. Both BUN and creatinine are relatively insensitive markers of decreased perfusion, especially BUN, and only begin to increase with substantial decreases in GFR. Serum lactate concentration may be a more sensitive marker of perfusion but can also be elevated in response to impaired tissue oxygen utilization or decreased hepatic lactate clearance. Measurement of central venous pressure (CVP) can be very useful in assessing the foal\u2019s fluid status. This technique is somewhat technically challenging but is feasible with limited equipment. If the foal has been catheterized with an over-the-wire 20-cm catheter, then the placement of the catheter tip will be fairly central, and this catheter can be used for the determination of an approximate CVP. With the foal in lateral recumbency all ingoing fluid therapy is stopped while the measurement is taken. A water manometer or electronic pressure transducer can be used, and the zero position on the manometer should be set at approximately the height of the base of the heart. The manometer is primed with sterile heparinized saline and then opened to the IV catheter. Slight fluctuations of pressure should be observed with respirations, and the measurement taken is the approximate mean of this range.",

Rather than simply dividing up the calculated fluid deficit and administering it over a set period of time (i.e., 2.5 L over 12 hours), it is more useful to administer boluses of replacement fluids at 20 mL/kg (e.g., 1 L to a 50-kg foal) over 10 to 30 minutes and then reassess the patient\u2019s status and determine whether further boluses are required.

Excessive administration of bolus fluid therapy has been associated with worsened outcomes in human patients.867, 868 If greater than 60 to 80 mL/kg of fluid replacement is required and the patient remains hypotensive, then they should be considered nonresponsive to fluid therapy, and the initiation of inotrope and/or vasopressor therapy should be seriously considered (see the next section Inotrope and Vasopressor Therapy).

In many clinical situations the foal does not have a urinary catheter in place, so assessment of renal losses is entirely empiric based on frequency of urination and perceived volume. The assessment of gastrointestinal losses is similar in nature, whereas the losses caused by sweating are extremely difficult to estimate. The fluids used for replacement of losses should be isotonic balanced replacement solutions, because the fluids lost by these routes will be accompanied by electrolyte losses as well. If foals appear to be urinating and defecating normally and are not obviously sweating, then additional replacement fluids are not indicated. In those foals with increased losses associated with these systems one can add intermittent boluses of 10 to 20 mL/kg of replacement-type fluids to address the estimated loss. Monitoring of ongoing fluid therapy is very important and requires frequent assessment to ensure that the goals for fluid therapy in the individual patient are being achieved and to avoid the development of adverse outcomes such as fluid overload.

Although many foals suffering from hypotension will respond well to IV fluid administration, a subset of these cases will be nonresponsive to fluids and will require additional blood pressure support. Treatment with inotropes and vasopressors may be indicated in these cases to increase cardiac contractility and afterload, respectively. Administration of these agents requires that the foal be in a hospital environment with close monitoring of hemodynamic function and the availability of electronic infusion pumps that can provide accurate CRIs. Blood pressure monitoring is absolutely essential, and this can be accomplished by direct (arterial catheter) or indirect (oscillometric tail cuff) means. In most situations the indirect approach will be used because the placement and maintenance of arterial catheters in foals can be extremely challenging.

Indirect techniques are not ideal because they can be affected by tail cuff size and placement and can be inaccurate, but they provide acceptable accuracy for clinical use, particularly in the monitoring of trends in MAP over time.870, 871\n",

In human patients, exceeding the critical lower level for MAP, which is regarded as 60 to 65 mm Hg, is vital to maintain cerebral, coronary, and renal blood flow.872 A major goal in the management of critically ill foals, therefore, is to maintain the MAP above 60 mm Hg, although this level does not necessarily indicate adequate tissue perfusion.130, 873, 874 There is no apparent advantage to achieving higher MAP, and doing so may actually be deleterious because of altered distribution of blood flow resulting in decreased perfusion of some tissues.718, 872 It is critical to use other indicators of tissue perfusion, including heart rate, mentation, central venous oxygen tension, urine output, acid-base status, and trends in blood lactate concentration, because it has been suggested that neonatal foals may have a different physiologic response to hypotension than adult horses.873 When implementing inotrope or vasopressor therapy it is advised to start at the lowest end of the dosage range (Table 20.18\n) and to monitor the response to therapy before increasing the dosage because it is impossible to predict the response of an individual patient. The short half-life of these agents means that the response to therapy can be assessed quickly, often in as little as 10 to 15 minutes, reinforcing the need for continual patient reevaluation.",

Concurrent stimulation of \u03b22-receptors may also produce peripheral and splanchnic vasodilation. This vasodilatory effect may be unproductive because it can result in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and MAP, which means that dobutamine may not be the ideal choice as a single agent in the treatment of fluid-refractory hypotension.876 For this reason dobutamine is normally used in combination with a vasopressor in human patients.877 The positive benefit of the vasodilatory effect of dobutamine is that it may improve splanchnic perfusion when used concurrently with vasopressors.876 By increasing myocardial contractility dobutamine also increases myocardial oxygen demand, which can be problematic in the patient with already impaired oxygen delivery. The other concern with dobutamine is that because of its stimulation of \u03b21-receptors it can cause tachycardia and arrhythmias, especially at higher doses.877\n",

Eighteen foals were treated with vasopressin, whereas 16 foals received norepinephrine. Six of the foals in the vasopressin group had failed to respond to norepinephrine therapy, which was withdrawn before initiation of vasopressin therapy. The severity of illness was pronounced and similar between groups, with a mean lactate of 10.5 \u00b1 4.4 mmol/L in the vasopressin group and 9.6 \u00b1 4.6 mmol/L in the norepinephrine group. The two groups also had similar sepsis scores at admission, with a mean of 15.9 \u00b1 6.1 in the vasopressin group and 16.1 \u00b1 4.5 in the norepinephrine group. Vasopressin administration was associated with a significant increase in MAP and in urine output as well as a significant decrease in heart rate, whereas norepinephrine administration was associated with a significant increase in MAP. The overall survival rate in this study was only 38%, likely reflecting the severe systemic disease present in this population of foals evidenced by their admission sepsis scores and lactate concentrations, and was consistent with a previous report from the same institution, in which the survival rate for foals presenting with lactate concentrations greater than 6 mmol/L was reported to be only 40%.126 The authors of this report also describe increased use of vasopressin as a first-line therapy for foals with refractory hypotension.889\n",

Most often these compounds are used to regulate fever and local inflammation, reducing patient discomfort, but there are situations in which they are required for the control of systemic inflammation as well. The primary class of antiinflammatories used in foals is NSAIDs, which consists of drugs inhibiting arachidonic acid synthesis via COX inhibition. These drugs typically exhibit antipyretic, antiinflammatory, and analgesic effects.894 There are also several drugs in the NSAID group that have effects on pathways other than arachidonic acid metabolism. The second class of antiinflammatory drugs is the corticosteroids (steroidal antiinflammatory drugs [SAIDs]). These drugs have potent dose-dependent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, but typically have little antipyretic or analgesic activity.665 In situations where the primary goal is analgesia one can use NSAIDs, but opioid drugs provide analgesia without the concerns regarding gastrointestinal and renal toxicity associated with many NSAIDs. Although not commonly used in very young foals, alternative analgesics such as ketamine and lidocaine may be beneficial in managing older foals with severe, refractory pain.",

Nonspecific COX inhibition can be associated with side effects including gastrointestinal ulceration and renal injury.895 Phenylbutazone has been associated experimentally and clinically with toxicity in foals895, 896 and appears to have a narrow therapeutic index in this population. In addition, it can be difficult to administer appropriate dosages of phenylbutazone to foals because of their small size and the composition of the forms of phenylbutazone that are available. For all of these reasons phenylbutazone is rarely used in foals. Flunixin meglumine, however, when given parenterally at appropriate dosages, has been demonstrated to be safe in foals, even when administered for several weeks,897, 898 and this is supported by clinical experience. Flunixin meglumine is primarily used in foals with severe systemic inflammation, severe discomfort, or persistent fevers. It is important to note that the metabolism and elimination of NSAIDs can be impaired in neonatal foals, potentially requiring increases in dosing or prolongation of the dosing interval.899, 900, 901 For these reasons it is recommended that the nonspecific COX inhibitors be used with caution in the clinically ill neonatal foal, particularly in foals with severe systemic inflammation, hypovolemia, or the potential for gastric ulceration.",

For short-term analgesia the \u03b12-adrenergic agonists, such as xylazine and detomidine, are commonly used because they are very effective in controlling severe pain. The limitations of the \u03b12 drugs are profound sedation and decreases in gastrointestinal motility.920 Alternatively, one could consider the use of an opioid agonist or agonist/antagonist. Butorphanol, an opioid agonist/antagonist, is the most commonly used drug because it is readily available and safe to administer. The limitations of butorphanol are primarily that it causes substantial sedation and only lasts for a short period of time when given as a bolus. Administering butorphanol as a CRI allows for a much more stable analgesic effect and may lessen the sedative effects. Opioid agonists, such as tramadol and fentanyl, are rarely used in foals but could have utility in managing chronic, severe musculoskeletal pain.921, 922 Lidocaine is a local anesthetic, but when administered systemically as a CRI it can provide effective analgesia, especially for visceral pain. It is not associated with sedative effects but can cause neurologic signs if given at an excessive rate. In a recent study lidocaine administration to foals achieved lower systemic concentrations than in adult horses but appeared to be safe and clinically effective.923 Ketamine is a dissociative agent most commonly used for induction and/or maintenance of general anesthesia, but it has been reported to have analgesic effects when administered at lower doses as a CRI.920\n",

This situation can be addressed by the use of a lipid-containing parenteral nutrition solution, but if this is ineffective then the only alternative is administration of exogenous insulin. The administration of insulin to the neonatal foal is not to be undertaken lightly because this therapy places additional demands on both the clinician and nursing staff to ensure that profound hypoglycemia does not occur. Intermittent dosing of subcutaneous insulin may offer some advantages in terms of simplicity of administration, expense, and moderation of effects, but this route of administration does not allow for changes in dosage over the short term. One recommended dosage for subcutaneous insulin in foals is 0.1 to 0.5 IU of regular insulin every 12 hours.950 A retrospective report of foal parenteral nutrition described subcutaneous insulin dosage rates 0.02 to 0.1 IU/kg given every 6 to 24 hours.949 This approach is not recommended because the risks of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are greater than with CRIs, and it can be much more challenging to achieve homeostasis in terms of blood glucose concentrations when using intermittent bolus insulin therapy.",

Because of the gradual saturation of the cellular insulin receptors, the maximal effect of CRI insulin is not typically seen until roughly 90 minutes after initiation of the infusion. The response to the alteration of the rate of infusion occurs over a similar time frame, so one should take care to avoid altering the rate of infusion of parenteral nutrition solutions too soon after changing the rate of insulin infusion. An initial insulin infusion rate of 0.07 IU/kg per hour of regular insulin has been reported to be well tolerated and may represent a reasonable starting point in foals intolerant of parenteral nutrition.720, 951 This dosage was derived from a retrospective study of foals treated with parenteral nutrition, which reported initial insulin doses ranging from 0.014 to 0.2 IU/kg per hour, with a mean of 0.065 IU/kg per hour.719 Interestingly, in that study the final insulin dose ranges remained very similar, from 0.015 to 0.2 IU/kg per hour, with a mean of 0.07 IU/kg per hour. Some advocate starting at lower dosages in foals, such as 0.01 IU/kg per hour.952 This conservative approach is very safe, with less risk of hypoglycemia than the higher dosage rate, but may require a longer period of time before the dose is titrated to a high enough level to control hyperglycemia. Even lower dosage rates of insulin have been reported, with a recent retrospective report describing insulin infusions at dosages of 0.0016 to 0.018 IU/kg per hour.949\n",

When \u201cfine-tuning\u201d insulin therapy it is best to avoid simultaneous alterations in both the insulin infusion rate and the parenteral nutrition infusion rate, because this can lead to a \u201croller-coaster ride\u201d in which the blood glucose concentration rises and falls wildly because of the delay in the body\u2019s response to these changes720 (Box 20.6\n). Blood glucose monitoring should be performed at least hourly for the first 2 to 3 hours after initiation of the insulin CRI, and if hyperglycemia (blood glucose >150 mg/dL) is persistent beyond the first 2 hours of insulin therapy, then the insulin infusion rate may be increased by 50%, followed by hourly blood glucose monitoring for a further 2 to 3 hours. This procedure for increasing the insulin infusion rate may be repeated if hyperglycemia persists. Conversely, if hypoglycemia (blood glucose <60 mg/dL) is noted then a bolus of 0.25 to 0.5 mL/kg of 50% dextrose solution should be administered intravenously over 3 to 5 minutes. The blood glucose level should then be reassessed every 30 minutes for at least 90 minutes ensure that hypoglycemia does not recur. If hypoglycemia does recur, then a second bolus of dextrose is administered and the insulin infusion rate is decreased by 50%. Close monitoring will then be required for a further 60 to 90 minutes to ensure that hypoglycemia does not recur and that hyperglycemia does not develop. Further changes to the insulin infusion rate are not usually necessary once a steady state has been achieved in which the blood glucose level is stable and the desired rate of parenteral nutrition administration has been achieved. Patient reassessment is indicated if one finds that the foal has become even more insulin resistant (requiring additional insulin administration to avoid hyperglycemia) as there may be an overall deterioration in the patient\u2019s condition accompanied by increasing systemic inflammation. When insulin therapy is to be discontinued the insulin administration rate should be gradually titrated downward in parallel with the parenteral nutrition rate, but there can be a substantial lag between changes in the insulin infusion rate and the patient\u2019s response to this change. Some time should be allowed to account for this lag. It is critical that foals being weaned from insulin infusions receive some form of enteral nutrition during this time period. It may be wise to wean them from parenteral nutrition and insulin over longer periods of time (24\u201336 hours) than would be required for a foal receiving parenteral nutrition alone to prevent glucose derangements.\nBOX 20.6Protocol for the Monitoring and Regulation of Insulin When Administered as a Continuous Rate Infusion to Foals\n\n",
