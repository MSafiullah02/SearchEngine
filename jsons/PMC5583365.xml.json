In severe infection cases, EV71 can damage the central nervous system (CNS), leading to viral meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis and pulmonary edema with high fatality2. EV71 was first identified in California in 19693. In the past three decades, EV71 epidemics have been observed in China, Australia, the United States, Germany, Malaysia, etc.4\u20138, causing serious threats to global public health. In 1998, a severe outbreak of EV71 in Taiwan caused approximately 129,000 cases including 405 severe cases and 78 deaths8. From March 2008 - June 2009, more than 600,000 HFMD cases and 126 deaths were reported in China9. Although an inactivated vaccine was developed recently, its efficacy and safety require further testing10. Unfortunately, no approved direct-acting antiviral drug is available for EV71 infection to date. Development of antiviral agents represents an urgent unmet need for EV71 control.",

The genomic RNA encodes a large and single precursor polyprotein11. The precursor is then processed into three polyproteins: P1, P2, and P312. P1 is further cleaved into four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4). P2 and P3 are proteolytically cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins (2 A, 2B, 2 C, 3 A, 3B, 3 C, and 3D) during viral infection and replication13. Among the viral proteins, 3 C protease (3Cpro) is essential for precursor and polyproteins processing, RNA binding, and viral replication14, 15. Thus, 3Cpro is generally considered to be an appealing target for anti-EV71 drug development. Sensitive and effective screening to identify the chemical compounds or unpurified natural products that inhibit 3Cpro activity is a key technology for EV71 treatment.",

            "text": "Luciferase (Luc) refers to a class of oxidative enzymes that catalyze specific luciferin substrates to produce bioluminescence. Several luciferases require no post-translational processing for enzymatic activity and show a linear relationship between concentration and their resulting bioluminescence16, 17. These properties render them excellent genetic reporters. Luc-fused proteins can be easily quantified by measuring their catalyzed bioluminescence with a luminometer, providing the detection sensitivity up to femtogram level18. Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) is a naturally secreted luciferase from the deep sea copepod Gaussia Princeps\n19. Deletion of the N-terminal secretion signal peptide of GLuc made it intracellularly retained but did not affect its catalytic activity20. In 2013, scientists found that the fusion of mouse pro\u2013interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 on the N-terminal of GLuc lacking its secretion signal peptide can inhibit its catalytic activity because pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 possesses a strong propensity to form protein aggregates, and based on this, they developed a biosensor pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2-GLuc (iGLuc) that can report the proteolytic activity of caspase-1 in the course of inflammasome activation in a highly sensitive manner21.",

As shown in Fig. 1, a canonical enterovirus 3Cpro cleavage site EALFQ\u2193GPPK was inserted between mouse pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 and GLuc lacking its secretion signal peptide to generate the biosensor pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2-enterovirus 3Cpro cleavage site-GLuc (i-3CS-GLuc). Within this biosensor, the GLuc enzyme is normally inactive because of the protein aggregation caused by pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2. We demonstrated that the 3Cpro of EV71 and some other enteroviruses could recognize and process the EALFQ\u2193GPPK site within i-3CS-GLuc, thus activating the GLuc enzyme and allowing the monitoring of cytosolic cleavage events and protease activity with high sensitivity and specificity.

As shown in Fig. 2C, with or without EV71 3Cpro, the negative control iGLuc generated similar bioluminescence of (3.06 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 105 and (3.20 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 105 (N = 3) in HEK293T cells. In contrast, when we co-expressed EV71 3Cpro with our biosensors, which led to the cleavage of fusion proteins, bioluminescence increased significantly. For i-3CS-GLuc1, the signal increased from (2.82 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 105 to (7.04 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 105 (N = 3) in the presence of EV71 3Cpro. For i-3CS-GLuc2, a more significant increase of GLuc signal from (2.92 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 105 to (25.71 \u00b1 0.34) \u00d7 105 (N = 3) was measured. These results indicate that EV71 3Cpro-mediated cleavage relieved the suppression of GLuc catalytic activity by pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 in both biosensors. Thus, both biosensors can monitor the activity of EV71 3Cpro. However, the i-3CS-GLuc2 construct showed a higher sensitivity and signal to background ratio (SBR). Because no identified conformation analysis result was available for full length mouse pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 or GLuc, the conformation of i-3CS-GLuc constructs were predicted by I-TASSER server mainly based on homology to mature human IL-1\u03b2 using default parameter22\u201324. As shown in the top predicted models (Fig. S2), the 3Cpro cleavage site in i-3CS-GLuc2 is exposed on the surface, whereas the 3Cpro cleavage site in i-3CS-Gluc1 is partially surrounded by other domains of i-3CS-Gluc1, which may prevent the access of 3Cpro. Since the threading templates used for prediction has only 33% coverage of the full length of i-3CS-GLuc proteins, the quality of predicted models is low (C-score = \u22123.32 and \u22123.72, typically C-score is in the range of [\u22125, 2], a higher C-core implicates higher confidence of prediction). However, these predicted models indicated that the 3Cpro cleavage site is more accessible in i-3CS-GLuc2 than in i-3CS-GLuc1, which may lead to greater cleavage and explain the increased sensitivity of i-3CS-GLuc2. Thus, i-3CS-GLuc2 was used for the subsequent experiments.",

In 2013, scientists found that Rupintrivir also functions as a high-affinity inhibitor of EV71 3Cpro \n27. Thus, we used Rupintrivir to determine whether our biosensor could be used to measure the inhibition of EV71 3Cpro. To test whether Rupintrivir is toxic to human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cells, the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed. Rupintrivir at concentrations from 25 nM to 2 \u03bcM showed no obvious toxicity to HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A). In the absence of Rupintrivir, EV71 3 Cpro cleaved and activated the biosensor i-3CS-GLuc2 to increase the GLuc signal from (4.07 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 105 to (44.40 \u00b1 4.49) \u00d7 105 (N = 3), with a SBR of 10.92 (Fig. 3C). However, upon treatment with 1 \u03bcM of Rupintrivir, EV71 3Cpro only led to a slight increase in signal from (4.42 \u00b1 0.58) \u00d7 105 to (5.16 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 105 (N = 3), with an SBR of 1.17. This result was highly consistent with Western blotting results (Fig. 3B), indicating that i-3CS-GLuc2 can accurately and sensitively monitor the inhibition event of EV71 3Cpro activity by Rupintrivir.\n",

First, the cytotoxicity of GW5074 on HEK293T cells was tested using CCK-8 assays. Treatment with GW5074 up to 20 \u03bcM showed no significant influence on cell viability (Fig. S3). To assess the anti-EV71 effects of GW5074, HEK293T-i-3CS-GLuc2 cells were infected with the EV71 BrCr-TR strain at an MOI of 4 and treated with different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcM) of GW5074. As shown in Fig. S4, obvious CPEs were observed at 24 h post infection without GW5074 treatment, whereas the CPEs in the cells treated with GW5074 were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. To assess the anti-EV71 effect of GW5074 using the i-3CS-GLuc2 biosensor, GLuc bioluminescence was measured 24 hours after infection. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment with GW5074 significantly decreased the resulting bioluminescence in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, WB assays showed that GW5074 treatment decreased EV71 VP1 expression (Fig. 5B) and RT-qPCR assay showed that GW5074 treatment decreased the EV71 VP1 mRNA level (Fig. 5C). The viral TCID50 was also decreased by GW5074 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D).

Briefly, peptides bearing protease cleavage sites and FRET donor-receptor pairs were used as substrates for in vitro purified proteases to analysis their activity. FRET signals were activated when cleavage of peptides separated the fluorescent donor from the acceptor. This strategy has been applied to multiple viral proteases for inhibitor screening, including NS2B-NS3 of West Nile Virus32 and 3C or 3C-like protease of Picornaviruses, Noroviruses, and Coronaviruses33. However, in vitro assays are often unable to reliably reflect the actual cleavage events that occur in complex milieus such as living cells and animals. In this study, both the biosensor and the reporter cell line allowed the monitoring of viral protease activity in living cells instead of in vitro. Numerous reports have demonstrated that the GLuc reporter can be used in small animal models as a marker to monitor different in vivo biological events such as tumor growth and proliferation, viral infection and replication as well as cell circulation34\u201336.
