For depletion of neutrophils, purified rat anti-Ly6G monoclonal antibody 1A842 was administered intraperitoneally (at a dose of 200 \u03bcg per mouse) 1 day before infection and every 48 hours thereafter. Animals were divided into five groups, ie, uninfected allantoic fluid\u2013inoculated control (Con), clodronate-liposome\u2013treated (CL), infected (INF), clodronate-liposome-treated and infected (CL-I), and 1A8-treated and infected (1A8-I). Two separate sets of mice (each consisting of five animals) were tested, one set for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and virus titer analyses, and the other for histopathology. The group of animals treated with 1A8 alone did not show any pathological changes in their lungs, and were thus excluded from further study. Within the infected groups, each animal was challenged with a sublethal dose of 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of PR8 virus through intranasal inoculation. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection and body weight loss. In separate experiments involving lethal virus challenge, each animal was infected with 500 PFU of virus.",

We observed a mortality of 40% in macrophage-depleted animals by 10 dpi, whereas none of the animals in the other infected groups died. Elevated numbers of total leukocytes including macrophages and neutrophils were noted following influenza virus infection (Figure 1B). As expected, macrophage-depleted animals showed decreased macrophages, but interestingly the total cell counts were higher than the other groups, with extensive neutrophil accumulation at 5 dpi. In comparison, anti-Ly6G\u2013treated and infected animals portrayed less neutrophil infiltration at 5 dpi. BALF total cell counts in all groups were significantly decreased by 10 dpi. Most strikingly, macrophage depletion enhanced viral replication, with higher peak viral titers at 5 dpi compared to neutrophil-depleted animals, thus indicating that macrophages are more critical in viral clearance from infected lungs. The virus titers declined by 10 dpi in all groups (Figure 1C).",

Here, we evaluated histopathological changes in infected animals depleted of either macrophages or neutrophils to investigate the possible link of specific cellular infiltrations with ALI. Most notably, macrophage-depleted, infected mice displayed excessive recruitment of neutrophils on 5 dpi (Figure 2, C and D), and developed pathological complications of DAD with accumulation of edema fluid, protein exudates, erythrocytes within alveolar air spaces, and thickened interstitium by 10 dpi (Figure 2I). In contrast, the neutrophil-depleted (Figure 2, E, F, and H) and infected groups (Figure 2, B and G) showed no signs of ARDS, although bronchitis and peribronchial inflammation were prominent at 5 dpi. Alveolitis with denuded epithelium and disintegrated interstitium were also more prominent in macrophage-depleted animals. Hemorrhage was rarely observed on day 5 dpi, whereas the presence of erythrocytes was more prominent on 7 dpi in macrophage-depleted mice (data not shown). By 10 dpi, all macrophage-depleted animals showed severe hemorrhage with accumulation of erythrocytes within air spaces compared to their nondepleted counterparts. Interestingly, in both infected groups, the cellular infiltrations declined by 10 dpi despite their distinct pathological manifestations. Clodronate-treated, anti-Ly6G\u2013treated, or uninfected control animals showed no apparent pathological changes, except that clodronate-treated uninfected mice displayed minimal neutrophil infiltration on 5 dpi (Figure 2A) that resolved by 10 dpi. Table 1 summarizes the semiquantitative data of the histopathological analyses. In concurrence with the latter, blood gas analysis on 10 dpi revealed decreased partial pressure of arterial oxygen (pAO2) and saturation of arterial oxygen (sAO2) in macrophage-depleted animals compared to their infected neutrophil-depleted and nondepleted counterparts. On the other hand, increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (pACO2) in macrophage-depleted animals suggested severe hypoxemia (Table 2). Secondary bacterial pneumonia following primary influenza virus infection constitutes an important complication and cause of death. To exclude the possibility that ALI and ARDS were due to secondary bacterial infections, we plated the BALF samples onto nutrient and blood agar. The resultant bacterial counts were very low (ranging from 0 to 275 colony-forming units/mL) for the control, infected, and macrophage-depleted groups, thus excluding secondary bacterial pneumonia associated with ALI or ARDS.",

Extensive induction of NETS was found in infected lungs, predominantly within the alveoli, evident by histopathology and immunofluorescence analysis (Figure 5, A to E). NETs were largely lodged in areas of tissue consolidation, and DNA fibers were entangled with the alveolar epithelium and small blood vessels in areas with hemorrhagic lesions, indicating that NETs may contribute to thin alveolar\u2013capillary damage. Occasionally, NETs appeared as extended nuclei attached to the endothelium of large blood vessels, or to the bronchiolar epithelial lining causing occlusions in small airways (Figure 5, C and E).

Influenza virus infection also enhanced levels of epithelial cell\u2013derived neutrophil attractant-78 (ENA-78 or CXCL-5) in LA-4 cells (4.1-fold greater than the uninfected control, P < 0.05). To understand the mechanism of NETs induction during epithelial\u2013neutrophil interaction, the coculture was incubated in the presence of anti-MPO antibody, DPI (NADPH oxidase inhibitor), DETC (SOD inhibitor), or anti\u2013ENA-78 antibody. As shown in Figure 6H, significant reduction in NETs release was observed in the presence of anti-MPO and SOD inhibitor, but not with DPI or anti\u2013ENA-78. The opposite effects of DETC and DPI on NETs formation may be attributed to the different modes of action of the inhibitors at the concentrations tested. The SOD-related conversion of superoxide to H2O2 is blocked by DETC,46 whereas DPI inhibits NADPH oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, and xanthine oxidase.47 Furthermore, exposure of H2O2 alone significantly induced NETs formation. These results suggest that superoxide-generated H2O2 may contribute to NETs induction in influenza pneumonia. These studies also indicate that NETs formation is an active mechanism which could participate in ALI. A possible hypothesis is that influenza virus infection of epithelial cells induces superoxide and H2O2 generation, which in turn stimulate MPO present on the surface of neutrophils, thus inducing NETs and mediating tissue injury.",

Second, our data provide the first evidence demonstrating NETs induction in influenza virus pneumonitis in vivo with their prominent appearance within alveoli and airways, and in lesions of tissue injury. Thirdly, co-incubation of neutrophils with influenza virus\u2013primed alveolar epithelial cells induced release of NETs, which was abrogated by inhibitors of redox enzymes (including MPO and SOD), thus implicating redox enzymes in NETs formation.",

These results are congruent with previous studies demonstrating relatively high mortalities in macrophage-depleted mice compared to neutrophil-depleted mice challenged with 1918 reconstituted virus.21 Furthermore, our studies revealed that macrophage depletion led to intense neutrophilic infiltration into alveoli and airways as observed at 5 dpi, and eventually these mice portrayed clinical signs of ARDS and histological features of DAD, with alveolar spaces filled with proteinaceous exudates and erythrocytes by 10 dpi. Severe hypoxemia in macrophage-depleted infected animals was evident by decreased pAO2 and sAO2 levels, compared to their nondepleted or neutrophil-depleted counterparts. Neutrophil-depleted or nondepleted infected mice had milder lung injury with more prominent bronchopneumonia. Progressive pathological complications of ALI were observed in macrophage-depleted animals at 7 and 8 dpi (data not shown) with prominent clinical signs of respiratory distress. A previous study showed that neutrophil depletion was associated with increased lethality in H3N2 infection, with mainly bronchitis and systemic viral spread.28 In contrast, our mouse model displayed severe alveolitis and pulmonary edema. Compared to nondepleted or neutrophil-depleted mice, high viral titers were observed in macrophage-depleted mice despite the intense influx of neutrophils, implying that macrophages are more important in viral clearance. These findings concur with previous studies on influenza infections in pigs and mice. No significant bacterial infection was noticed in any group, suggesting that damage was not attributable to secondary bacterial pneumonia.",

Moreover, elevated levels of T1-\u03b1 and thrombomodulin (membrane proteins of alveolar type I pneumocytes and endothelium, respectively) in BALF of infected macrophage-depleted animals reflected damage of the pulmonary microvascular bed. Alveolar type I cells and endothelium constitute the microvascular bed that forms the physical barrier that prevents fluid flux into the air spaces. Previously, we demonstrated enhanced apoptotic death of infected alveolar epithelial cells during blockade of macrophage recruitment into the lungs.43 Our results indicate that excessive neutrophil recruitment, activation, and release of toxic enzymes can exacerbate the damage of alveolar epithelium by virus infection, leading to vascular leakage, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia, thus finally developing into ARDS.",

NETs formation is also linked with tissue injury in sepsis and small vessel vasculitis.30,35 The DNA entangled with the endothelium of small blood vessels appear with capillary damage both in vivo and in vitro.35 Here, we provide novel data to validate the induction of NETs following lethal influenza virus challenge of mice. Bundles of DNA fibers appeared prominently in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles within areas of tissue consolidation. Only a subpopulation of neutrophils produced NETs, since we also detected unstimulated neutrophils with disintegrated nuclei that were undergoing apoptosis or necrosis. The existence of DNA fibers closely entangled to the alveolar epithelium suggests that these structures may contribute to damage of the alveolar\u2013capillary barrier. Occasionally, NETs were found attached to the endothelium of large blood vessels or occluding some of the airways. Similar observations were made in small vessel vasculitis and sepsis, wherein extensive NETs accumulate inside the glomerular capsule or cause occlusion of sinusoids, and NETs were prominent in patient tissue biopsies with intense neutrophil infiltration. Immunostaining revealed the presence of histone, MMP-9, and MPO colocalized with DNA chromatin fibers. NETs formation in macrophage-depleted infected mice was more obvious, thus suggesting that NETs induction may participate in pathological events, and spur progression toward ARDS. In contrast, lungs of nondepleted or neutrophil-depleted infected animals only showed scattered NETs formation.",

Neutrophils isolated from influenza virus\u2013infected mice indeed stimulated NETs release when incubated with murine alveolar epithelial cells primed with influenza virus, thus suggesting that interactions of these cells are critical for NETs generation. NETs formation is a distinct mode of cell death induced by reactive oxygen intermediates, NADPH oxidase, and cytokines such as IL-8.37,49 Influenza virus infection of alveolar epithelial cells led to increased superoxide activity and elevated CXCL-5, a chemokine known to stimulate neutrophils and induce chemotaxis. To investigate the mechanism of NETs, we used inhibitors or antibodies against CXCL-5 and redox enzymes (including MPO, SOD, NADPH oxidase). We found that inhibition of MPO and SOD, but not of NADPH oxidase, reduced NETs generation. Concurrently, we observed extensive NETs induction when neutrophils were incubated in the presence of H2O2, a product of SOD activity. This finding was observed previously, ie, H2O2-generating enzyme can cause significant NETs induction.36 Taken together, these experiments describe a novel mechanism of NETs induction via H2O2 production by infected target cells. The generation of H2O2 may in turn activate MPO present on the neutrophil surface, and further investigations are warranted to understand how these interactions culminate in NETs induction.",

Although NETs were first identified to participate in bacterial killing, certain bacteria possess a defense strategy by producing endonucleases that can degrade the NETs.36,38 To test the functional significance of NETs in influenza, we performed endothelial injury and bactericidal activity studies. We found that NETs mediated damage of endothelial cells as evident by the cell death assay as well as by thrombomodulin release into the culture supernatant. Furthermore, incubation of neutrophils with different bacteria demonstrated that NETs inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae to a certain degree, but not of S. pneumoniae or S. aureus when incubated with an inhibitor of phagocytic activity.
