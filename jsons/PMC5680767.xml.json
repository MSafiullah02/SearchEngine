The Muscovy duck parvoviral disease, also named \u201cthree-week\u201d disease, mainly occurs in three-week-old Muscovy ducklings; the disease is characterized by locomotor dysfunction, stunting, abnormal feather development, and death. The mortality rate of the disease ranges from 10% to 80% depending on age [2\u20135]. Derzsy\u2019s disease is also named \u201cgosling plague\u201d in China and has been primarily described by Fang in 1961; it mainly breaks out in one-month-old goslings with the mortality rate reaching as high as 90% [6\u20138].",

The viral genomes are approximately 5.1-kb single-stranded DNA with equal polarities encapsidated in the viral capsids [10]. Their genomes are flanked by identical inverted terminal repeats (ITR), which consist of 456 nucleotides for MDPV, and 442 nucleotides for GPV [11, 12]. The outside portion of ITR can fold on itself to form a palindromic hairpin structure. The inside portion of ITR, also designated as the D sequence, reversely complements with the D\u2032 sequence in the 3\u2032 ITR, allowing the entire genomic molecule to form a larger range of palindromic structure [13]. ITR contains a terminal resolving site (TRS), Rep protein binding site (RBS), and other transcription factor binding sites, which are required for genome replication, transcription, packaging, and rescue from cloning vector [10, 14, 15].",

The left ORF encodes the viral non-structural protein Rep, whereas the right ORF encodes the structural protein. After alternative splicing of mRNA, the larger Rep1 protein and several smaller Rep proteins are produced [16, 17]. The Rep proteins can bind to the ITR and are involved in genome replication and modulation of downstream P41 promoter [18, 19]. By alternative splicing of mRNA, usage of initiation codon, and protease cleavage, the right ORF produces three structural proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3), which assemble the viral capsid at a ratio of 1:1:8 [20].",

Strain ZW was isolated from a deceased Muscovy duckling, which died from a disease outbreak in 2006 in Zhejiang province, China. In the course of retrospective investigation of the MDPV isolates collected from 1999 to 2006, the genome of ZW was found to possess a different restriction endonuclease digestion pattern from other MDPV isolates. In this study, the entire genome of ZW was sequenced and compared with other classical strains of MDPV and GPV.

            "text": "The VP3 gene consists of 1605 nucleotides encoding for 534 amino acids, which overlaps with the carboxyl terminus of the VP1 and VP2 proteins. As the major structural protein, the VP3 protein harbors most of the antigenic epitopes distributed on the surface of the viral capsid [10]. In this study, the VP3 gene of strain ZW incorporated approximately 1.1-kb foreign nucleotide sequence from GPV, which ultimately shaped the distinctive antigenicity of strain ZW, different from the classical strains of MDPV and GPV. In addition to the recombination events, several amino acid point mutations were also found to occur in the VP1 protein of strain ZW, all of which are specific for strain ZW and are different from those of the classical MDPV or GPV strains. Point mutations at amino acid positions 450, 485, 493, 548, and 585 were in the recombination region of the VP3 protein, whereas point mutations at positions 79 and 712 were outside of the recombination region. Therefore, the recombination and point mutations contributed to rapid evolution and increased fitness, respectively, and collectively promoted the emergence of the recombinant MDPV strain ZW.",

ITR not only functions as an origin of genome replication, but also contains several transcription factor binding sites, including E-box, ATF/CREB, and MLTF [10, 24]. These transcription factor binding sites are densely distributed in the 200-bp stem of the palindromic structure of ITR. Although these deleted nucleotides were at the base-pairing positions and did not influence the hairpin structure formation for the remaining nucleotides, the nucleotide deletions shortened the spacing distance between adjacent transcription factors. Whether the nucleotide deletions that occurred in ITR have potential influence on the transcription efficiency and contribute to virulence of strain ZW remain to be further investigated.",

Continuous molecular epidemiological investigation should be deployed to assess the incidence of strain ZW-like recombinant viral infection in the field. In view of the widespread usage of live vaccines in the Muscovy duck flocks, direct genome cloning and sequencing against the MDPV isolates is a more reliable method than PCR amplification for acquiring accurate sequence data for recombination analysis. However, whether the traditional bi-combined vaccine currently in use can still provide robust protection for Muscovy ducklings against infection from emerging recombinant MDPV in China remains to be evaluated and clarified.",

The attenuated vaccine strain SYG61v acted as the only minor parent, thereby contributing to the recombination event that occurred in the P9 promoter region.
