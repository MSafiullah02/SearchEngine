Assuming the time-independent connectivity correlations, we analyze the dynamics of spreading on linearly growing scale-free (SF) networks, and derive the extinction condition related to the rates of network growth, infection, and immunization of viruses. The behavior is consistent with the previous results for SF networks by a mean-field approximation without connectivity correlations. In particular, it is suggested that the growing must be stopped to prevent the spreading of infection. This insight helps to understand the spreading phenomena on communication or social networks.",

The needs become larger for understanding the mechanism of epidemic spreading and for finding effective strategies of the prevention against huge damage in economy or life by computer viruses via e-mails [10] [21], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [12] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [13] , and so on. For the purposes, the study of infection disease on network models is useful. In particular, we should remark that many real networks, whose node and link are corresponding to individual (computer or person) and the (communicational, pathological, or sexual) contact between them, have scale-free (SF) structures based on natural rules of network growth with new nodes and preferential attachment for linking as rich-get-richer phenomenon [2] [4] , in which the degree distribution exhibits a power-law as P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , 2 < \u03b3 < 3, for the probability of k connections in address-books of e-mails [8] [9] or sexual partners [12] .",

Indeed, the important properties of SF networks are the robust and vulnerable connectivities against random and targeted attacks, respectively [1] . The property is applicable for the targeted immunization for hubs [7] [19] to prevent the spreading of infection.

            "text": "In striking contrast with the usual models for epidemic spreading [3] , it has been shown [17] that a susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) model on heterogeneous SF networks has no epidemic threshold at a large network size nearly infinity; infection can be proliferated, whatever small infection rate they have. This result is closely related to the bond percolation problem. The epidemic threshold in a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model coincides with the threshold for the bond percolation problem on networks [15] . On the other hand, in a closed system of the conventional susceptible-hidden-infectedrecovered (SHIR) or SIR model, the number of infection is initially increased and saturated, finally converged to zero as the extinction. The pattern may be different in an open system, in fact, oscillations have been described by a deterministic Kermack-McKendrik model [20] . However a constant population (equal rates of the birth and the death) or territorial competition has been mainly discussed in the model, the growth of computer network or world-wide human contacts is obviously more rapid, and the communications of mailing or the transportations are not competitive. Even in a new report for modeling the SARS epidemic [13] , the mechanism of widely rapid spreading is not clear enough, though further treatments for the heterogeneity in transmission through superspreaders has been pointed out and the effectiveness of quarantine has been discussed. The strategic quarantine in both the model and experiences in Hong Kon is potentially related to prevent the typically observed recoverable prevalence [10] [21] in an open system as growing with new individuals. Fig. 1 shows an example of typically observed pattern in the prevalence of computer viruses.",

When no growing a k = 0 (as a closed system) is applied to the above results, the condition (6) for damping oscillation is not satisfied, while the extinction condition (8) is satisfied. In other words, it is suggested that a growing network causes the recoverable prevalence of infection. By replacing a k = Ak \u2212\u03bd with the Krapivsky-Render's n k [11] and using their n kk = (k\u22121)(5k+2) k 2 (k+1) 2 (2k+1)(2k\u22121) , k \u2265 2, we can check that n kk < 1+2\u03b40 4kb is satisfied for any 0 < b, \u03b4 0 < 1. The reason why viruses tend to be extinct in their GN model by even random immunization is that the infected parts are disconnected by recovered nodes on the tree structure, while our model generally has other bypass links than the links of tree in the difference of the degree distributions a k t and their n k t for small k, therefore infection can be spreading.",
