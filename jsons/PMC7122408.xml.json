Although still quite young by many standards, since the 1950s, this field of marine natural products has undergone exponential growth and proven to be a productive source for structurally diverse secondary metabolites. Due to long evolutionary processes favoring the accumulation of strongly bioactive compounds, sponges (Porifera) and their associated microorganisms have become the largest contributors of marine natural products. Seemingly primitive and morphologically defenseless organisms like sponges developed ingenious survival strategies which rely heavily on the accumulation of defensive products protecting them from a multitude of stress factors that involve overgrowth by fouling organisms, attacking by predators, and invasion by pathogenic microorganisms. Sponges are classified in four major classes: Calcarea, Demospongiae, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha. Among them, three genera, namely, Haliclona, Petrosia, and Discodemia have been identified to be the richest source of biologically active compounds. The chemical diversity of sponge products is high with compounds classified as alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides, polyketides, steroids, and macrolides, which integrate a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial.",

SAR studies, using in vitro cytotoxicity and cell proliferation assays against stomach (AGS), colon (HT29), and human brain (SH-SY5Y) cancer cell lines, and a noncancerous control cell line, demonstrated that franklinolides A was the dominant cytotoxic agent (GI50 range from 0.1 to 0.3 \u03bcM). SAR analysis defined the relative importance of key structural features: (1) a very significant 30- to >300-fold decrease in cytotoxicity following hydrolysis of franklinolides A to bitungolide A [145] (the de-3-O-methyl-2-phosphoglyceric acid derivative of franklinolides A); (2) 2- to 7-fold decrease on isomerization of franklinolides A to the 12E,14E isomer franklinolides B; and (3) a 30- to 50-fold decrease on isomerization of franklinolides A to the 12E,14Z isomer franklinolides C.",

In vitro assays and preliminary SAR studies (in 2010) showed that among the compounds 1\u20138, halenaquinone appeared as the most PLA2 inhibitor of the series with an IC50 of 3.7 \u03bcM. Incorporating a dioxothiazine unit in compounds 2 and 3 led to a 30- to 40-fold decrease in potency when compared with the most active pentacyclic polyketide 1, and among pentacyclic polyketide compounds, the presence of a secondary alcohol at C-3 rather than a ketone abolished PLA2 inhibition (4 and 5). These results highlighted that the C-3 oxidation state and the presence of quinone ring E were important for the anti-PLA2 activity [27, 146]. Similar conclusions were reported regarding the SAR of protein tyrosine kinase inhibition exhibited by halenaquinone (1) [147]. Farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitory experiments showed that the presence of dioxothiazine substitution (IC50 1 1.57 \u03bcM vs. 2 1.48 \u03bcM and 3 3.75 \u03bcM) led to little variation in human (FH) FTase inhibitory activity. Interestingly tetrahydrohalenaquinones A (4) and B (5) did not show such activity. Furthermore, quinol sulfates 6 (IC50 16.11 \u03bcM) and 7 (IC50 6.71 \u03bcM) exhibited modest activity suggesting that the presence of a quinone moiety was essential for FTases inhibitory activity. Sub-micromolar inhibition of farnesyltransferase enzyme of orhalquinone 8 (IC50 0.40 \u03bcM), highlighting this scaffold as a significant modification for enhancing activity [146]. Antiplasmodial activities against FcB1 and 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum strains revealed that compound 2, 3, and 8 were the most active of the series with values of IC50 1.08, 3.89, and 9.22, respectively.",

Plakortides M (363) and N (364) were isolated from the sponge P. halichondroides, collected in Puerto Rico, in 2003, which exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against a number of cancer cell lines in the NCI human cancer screening program but with less selectivity [156]. Peroxyketal polyketides peroxyplakoric A3 (365) and B3 (366) esters isolated from Plakortis sp., collected at Zamami Island, Okinawa Prefecture, in 1993, showed IC50 = 50 ng/mL against P. falciparum with a selective toxicity index (about 200) [157]. SAR studies played crucial roles in both \u201cwestern\u201d alkyl side chain and the conformational behavior of the dioxane ring of these compounds according to the interaction with the Fe(II)-heme [158, 159].",

(order Poecilosclerida), Trachycladus sp. (order Axinellida), and Theonella sp. and Discodermia sp. (order Lithistida) [44\u20137 {Clardy, J.; He, H. U. S. Patent 1995, 5,476,953}] [160\u2013171]. It is remarkable to note that the first compound of this class of toxic polyketides, pederin, was isolated in 1953 from the beetle Paederus fuscipes [161]. The presence of pederin class of polyketides in such taxonomically distinct organisms indicated the possible microbial origin of these compounds. Pederins exhibited multiple interesting pharmacological activities. Pederin (368), the chemical defense agent of the blister beetle, and mycalamides A (369) and B (370) were reported to disrupt protein synthesis [161, 162, 164]. Furthermore, mycalamides A and B together with mycalamides C (371) and D (372) showed potent activity against the P388 murine leukemia cell line, giving IC50 values of 3.0, 0.7, 95.0, and 35.0 ng/mL, respectively [164, 168]. Theopederins A\u2013L (373\u2013384) were markedly cytotoxic against P388 murine leukemia cells with the activity of nM level [165, 167, 171]. 13-Des-O-methyl-onnamide A (385), dihydroonnamide A (386), onnamide B (387), l7-oxoonnamide B (388), onnamide C (389), onnamide D (390), and onnamide A (391) were highly cytotoxic against the P388 cell line with IC50 values of 0.15, 0.04, 0.13, 0.10.0.07, 0.02, and 0.01 \u03bcg/mL, respectively [166]. Onnamide F (392) was active against fungi Saccharomyces cerevisae with a value of LD99 1.4 \u03bcg/mL. No activity was observed against Bacillus subtilis or Eschericha coli, indicating a selective toxicity for eukaryotes [170]. Icadamides A (393) and B (394) were reported to show in vitro cytotoxicity against HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cell line with IC50 value of 63 nM and 0.17 nM, respectively. Among pederin type of compounds, only icadamide B (395) was studied for in vivo antitumor activity and exhibited activity against intraperitoneally and subcutaneously implanted tumors such as P388 mouse leukemia, M109 mouse lung tumors, and asbestos-induced pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. Icadamide C displayed potent cytotoxic activity against a small panel of five human solid tumor cell lines (A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, XF-498, and HCT-15) with ED50 values of less than 0.1 \u03bcg/mL [160].",

The vast majority of polyketides made in nature are assembled from acetate and propionate building blocks, whereas these spiculoic acids and zyggomphic acids incorporated the intact of butyrate units. Furthermore, the location of the olefin functionality formed by reduction of the \u03b2 ketone and dehydration after condensation of the phenylacetic acid starter unit with the first butyrate is unusual. Normally, the dehydration step in polyketide biosynthesis would yield an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester. In the biosyntheses of these polyketides, dehydration occurs in the opposite direction, leading to conjugation between the olefin and the phenyl ring [184].

Eight antitumor compounds including norhalichondrins A\u2013C (425\u2013427), homohalichondrins A\u2013C (428\u2013430), and halichondrins B (431) and C (432) were found from Halichondria okadai Kadota (Miura Peninsula, Tokyo) in 1986, among which halichondrin B exhibited remarkable in vivo antitumor activity [188]. In 1987, halichondramide (433), dihydrohalichondramide (434), and isohalichondramide (435) were isolated from the Pacific sponge Halichondria sp. (Kwajelein Island), among which halichondramide showed significant activity against Candida albicuns at 0.01 \u03bcg/disk in the standard disk assay [189], and dihydrohalichondramide and isohalichondramide had antifungal activity and inhibited cell division in the fertilized sea urchin egg assay [190]. In 1989, mycalolides A\u2013C (436\u2013438) were isolated from a sponge Mycale sp. (Kii Peninsula, Japan) and demonstrated antifungal activities against many pathogenic fungi and cytotoxic against B-16 melanoma cells with IC50s of 0.5\u20131.0 ng/mL [191]. The chemical investigation of Okinawan marine sponge Jaspis sp. in 1993 yielded jaspisamides A\u2013C (439\u2013441) which exhibited cytotoxicities against L1210 murine leukemia cells in vitro, with IC50 values of <0.001, <0.001, and < 0.001 \u03bcg/mL, and against human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells in vitro with IC50 values of 0.015, 0.006, and 0.013 \u03bcg/mL, respectively [192].

Swinholide A (444) was first isolated from a Red Sea sponge Theonella swinhoei (Gulf of Eilat, Israel, in 1985), demonstrating in vitro antifungal activity [193]. It was re-isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Theonella swinhoei in 1989 and exhibited potent cytotoxic activity (IC50 0.04 \u03bcg/mL) for KB cell [194]. Its absolute configuration was elucidated by means of the X-ray diffraction method and chemical derivations in 1990 [195]. Then, in 1990, swinholide B (445), swinholide C (446), and isoswinholide A (447) were also found from the Okinawan marine sponge Theonella swinhoei, among which, swinholide B and swinholide C exhibited potent cytotoxicity almost equivalent to that of swinholide A toward KB cell lines (IC50 0.041 and 0.052 \u03bcg/mL, respectively), while isoswinholide A showed weaker cytotoxicity (IC50 1.1 \u03bcg/mL) [196].",

A highly potent polyether macrolide antimitotic agent designated halistatin 1 (452) was isolated from Phakellia carteti (Grand Comore Island, Republic of Comoros), which showed strong cytotoxicity to L1210 murine leukemia cells with IC50 values of 0.5 nM. In the further mechanism study, it was shown to cause accumulation of cells arrested in mitosis, inhibited tubulin polymerization, and inhibits binding of radiolabeled vinblastine and GTP to tubulin [199]. Cinachyrolide A (453) was isolated from Cinachyra sp. which was highly cytotoxic against L1210 murine leukemia cells with an IC50 of <0.6 ng/mL [200]. In 1994, superstolides A (454) and B (455) were obtained from the deepwater marine sponge Neosiphonia superstes (New Caledonia) and demonstrated highly cytotoxic against human bronchopulmonary non-small-cell lung carcinoma NSCLC-N6-L 16 cells (IC50 0.04 and 0.039 \u03bcg/mL), murine leukemia P388 cells (IC50 both of 0.003 \u03bcg/mL), and human nasopharyngeal carcinoma KB cells (IC50 0.02 and 0.005 \u03bcg/mL) [201, 202]. Reidispongiolides A (456) and B (457) were isolated from Rekiivpmgia werulea n.gen. n.sp. (South of New Caledonia), which exhibited potent cytotoxicity against various human carcinoma cells with IC50 values of 0.01\u20130.16 \u03bcg/mL [203]. Lasonolide A (458) was isolated from Forcepia sp. (British Virgin Islands), as a potent cytotoxin against the A549 human lung carcinoma and P388 murine leukemia cell lines with IC50 values of 40 and 2 ng/mL, respectively. Further, it inhibited cell adhesion in the EL-4.IL-2 cell line with an IC50 of 19 ng/mL [204]. Isohomohalichondrin B (459) was found in New Zealand sponge Lissodendoryx sp. and showed significant cytotoxic activity against the P388 cell lines and selective cytotoxicity in the NCI\u2019S primary screen [205].",

In 1996, theonezolide A (462), a novel polyketide macrolide, isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Theonella sp. (Okinawa, Japan), caused a marked platelet shape change at low concentrations (0.2\u20130.6 \u03bcM) [207]. Leucascandrolide A (463), a doubly O-bridged 18-membered macrolide of a new type, i.e., possessing little C1-branching vs. extensive 1,3-dioxygenation and a peculiar side chain, was isolated from a calcareous sponge of a new genus, Leucuscundra caveoluta from the Coral Sea. It showed strong cytotoxic activity in vitro on KB cells and less marked action on P388 cells, as well as very strong inhibition of Candida albicans [208]. Compared with leucascandrolide A, leucascandrolide B (464) was found from the same sponge sample which showed only marginal cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines, with an IC50 of 5 \u03bcg/mL on KB cells and > 10 \u03bcg/mL on P388 murine leukemia cells and no activity on Candida albicans [209]. A marine sponge Fasciospongia rimosa (Okinawa, Japan) yielded zampanolide (465) which showed potent cytotoxicity (IC50 1\u20135 ng/mL) against P388, A549, HT29, and MEL28 cell lines [210]. In 1997, study of a deepwater sponge Lissodendoryx sp. (Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand) yielded neonorhalichondrin B (466), neohomohalichondrin B (467), 55-methoxyisohomohalichondrin B (468), 53-methoxyneoisohomohalichondrin B (469), and 53-epi-53-methoxyneoisohomohalichondrin B (470), and further antitumor assay demonstrated that they were highly cytotoxic against P388 cells with IC50 values of 0.4, 0.8, 10, and 0.1 ng/mL except 53-epi-53-methoxyneoisohomohalichondrin B, respectively [211]. Two novels, highly potent, cytotoxic macrolides and salicylihalamides A (471) and B (472), were isolated from the sponge Haliclona sp. (Rottnest Island, Australia). COMPARE pattern-recognition analyses of the NCI 60-cell mean-graph screening profiles of salicylihalamide A did not reveal any significant correlations to the profiles of known antitumor compounds in the NCI\u2019s \u201cstandard agent database,\u201d thus supporting the conclusion that the salicylihalamides represent a potentially important new class for antitumor lead optimization and in vivo investigations [212]. In 1998, thiomycalolides A (473) and B (474) were obtained from Mycale sp. (Kii Peninsula, Japan), which exhibited highly cytotoxic against P388 murine leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 18 ng/mL each [213].",

In 2000, antiproliferative bioassay-guided fractionation of an aqueous extract of the marine sponge Chondropsis sp. (Wollongong, Australia) provided chondropsins A (480) and B (481). Testing of chondropsin A in the NCI 60-cell screen revealed a mean-graph profile that did not correlate significantly with the profile of any compound class represented in the NCI standard agents database [215]. In 2001, 73-deoxychondropsin A (482) and chondropsin C (483) were isolated from two different collections of marine sponges belonging to the genus Ircinia (Ircinia ramose, Australia; Ircinia sp., Philippines) and exhibited IC50\u2019s of approximately 0.8 and 0.2 ng/mL toward the LOX and MOLT-4 cell lines, respectively [216]. Chondropsin D (484) exhibited IC50\u2019s of approximately 10 and 250 ng/mL toward the LOX and MOLT-4 cell lines, respectively [217]. In 2000, peloruside A (485) was found to be cytotoxic to P388 murine leukemia cells at approximately 10 ng/mL (18 nM) which was found in sponge Mycale sp. [218]. In 2010, peloruside B (486), a natural congener of peloruside A, was isolated from the New Zealand marine sponge Mycale hentscheli. Peloruside B was found to promote microtubule polymerization and arrest cells in the G2/M phase of mitosis similar to paclitaxel, and its bioactivity was comparable to that of peloruside A [219].",

Studies showed that different components affect the targeted disease by different mechanisms. Natural chemical products that can act as inhibitors of transcription factors may be effective against both malignant neoplasms and viral diseases. Most bioactive metabolites from sponges proved to be inhibitors of certain enzymes, which often mediate or produce mediators of intracellular or intercellular messengers involved in the pathogenesis of a disease [313].

Cytarabine is mainly used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), where it is the backbone of induction chemotherapy [315]. Cytosine arabinoside interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, which damages DNA when the cell cycle holds in the S phase (synthesis of DNA). The cells requiring DNA replication for mitosis are therefore most affected [315]. Cytosine arabinoside was also considered as inhibitor of both DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide reductases needed for DNA synthesis. As an antiviral agent, cytarabine was often used to inhibit deoxycytidine utilization. Due to the rapid deamination in the body into the inactive uracil derivative, cytarabine therefore is often given by continuous intravenous infusion [316].\n",

Docking analysis confirmed DNMT inhibition data in vitro and revealed binding of Iso-3 within the DNA binding site of DNMT1 [320]. Subsequent increased expression of tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) could be correlated to decreased methylation of CpG sites within the essential Sp1 regulatory region of its promoter. Iso-3 induced growth arrest of cancer cells in G0/G1 with increasing p21 and p27 expression and reducing cyclin E1, PCNA and c-myc levels. Fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the reduced proliferation was accompanied by morphological changes as autophagy. Furthermore, Iso-3 strongly synergized with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in RAJI [combination index (CI) = 0.22] and U937 cells (CI = 0.21) and increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis via a mechanism involving reduction of survivin expression but not of Bcl-2 family proteins nor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) [321]. Treatment of Iso-3 decreased FLIPL expression and triggered activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with increased GRP78 expression, which eventually induced TRAIL receptor death receptor (DR)5 surface expression. Importantly, as a potential candidate for further anticancer drug development, Iso-3 reduced the viability, colony, and in vivo tumor forming potential without affecting the viability of PBMCs from healthy donors or zebrafish development [321].\n",

In 2009, LaBarbera et al. illustrated that naamidine A triggers biomarkers of apoptosis like externalization of phosphatidylserine, cleavage and activation of caspases-3, \u22128, and \u2212 9, and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential indicating that the cell death caused by naamidine A in epidermoid carcinoma cells (A-431) is a consequence of apoptosis instead of cytotoxicity. It is also reported that naamidine A inhibits the growth of tumor xenograft by activating caspase-3 manifesting apoptosis activity in vivo. Besides, naamidine A-caused apoptosis does not depend on functional p53 and is independent of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 [326].\n",

It was published that PM060184 presents the highest known affinities among tubulin-binding agents and that it targets tubulin dimers at a new binding site. PM060184 has a potent antitumor activity in a panel of different tumor xenograft models. Moreover, PM060184 is able to overcome P-gp-mediated resistance in vivo, an effect that could be related to its high binding affinity for tubulin. PM060184 is an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that reduces microtubule dynamicity in cells by 59% [333]. PM060184 suppresses microtubule shortening and growing at a similar extent. This action affects cells in interphase and mitosis. In the first case, the compound induced a disorganization and fragmentation of the microtubule network and the inhibition of cell migration. In the second case, it induced the appearance of multipolar mitosis and lagging chromosomes at the metaphase plate. These effects correlated with a nonclassical apoptosis pathway, which caused prometaphase arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis or appearance of cells in a multinucleated interphase-like state. Taken together, PM060184 represents a new tubulin-binding agent with promising potential as an anticancer agent [334].\n",

This non-taxane molecule is a structurally simplified synthetic analogue of halichondrin B derived from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai [335]. Different from other tubulin-targeted agents like taxanes, epothilones, and vinca alkaloid, which affect both growth and shortening of microtubules, eribulin only affects growth by binding to the microtubules and suppressing microtubule polymerization without affecting shortening, thereby sequestering tubulin into nonfunctional aggregates [336, 337]. The prohibited formation of mitotic spindles leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as a result of prolonged mitotic blockage. Eribulin remains to be active in taxane-resistant cell lines with \u03b2-tubulin mutations and those which overexpress P-gp according to in vitro studies. It\u2019s reported to be manageably safe in a 21-day-cycle administration, neutropenia being the main dose limit among all toxicities, with an MTD of 1.4 mg/m2 in phase I studies, but seems to be both effective and safe in several phase II studies. Therefore, it has been applied to patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease [335\u2013337].\n",

Hemiasterlin, a potent cytotoxic tripeptide, was originally isolated from marine sponges [344]. E7974 acts via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism. E7974 inhibits polymerization of purified tubulin in vitro with IC50 values similar to those of vinblastine. In cultured human cancer cells, E7974 induces G2/M arrest and marked disruption of mitotic spindle formation. Consistent with this observation, E7974 induces caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, typical biochemical markers of apoptosis. Only a short cellular exposure to E7974 is sufficient to induce maximum mitotic arrest, suggesting that E7974\u2019s antitumor effects in vivo may persist even after blood levels of the drug decrease after drug administration. Investigation of interactions of E7974 with purified tubulin using two synthetic tritiated photoaffinity analogues of E7974 indicated that E7974 seems to share a unique, predominantly \u03b1-tubulin-targeted mechanism with other hemiasterlin-based compounds, suggesting the hemiasterlins evolved to mainly target \u03b1-tubulin, not \u03b2-tubulin subunits unlike many tubulin-targeted natural products [345].\n",

Ascididemin was isolated in 1988 from the tunicate Didemnum sp. and showed remarkable in vitro cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cells including multi-drug resistant cells lines [350, 351]. Similar to other planar pyridoacridine derivatives, ascididemin interacts with DNA and recognizes triplex and quadruplex structures especially G-quadruplexes. Different mechanisms of action for this alkaloid have been proposed including topoisomerase I and II toxins. However, experiments with cell lines resistant to these toxins indicated that topo I and II are not potential targets for ascididemin (ASC) in the cell but may be by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to cleave DNA. Own work contributes to its action on the apoptotic signaling in Jurkat leukemia cells. Interestingly, ACS induces a mitochondrial pathway that requires the activation of caspase-2 upstream of mitochondria. Caspase-2 activation was not blocked by the overexpression of Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xL and was responsible for caspase-9 activation. As a possible link between caspase-2 and mitochondrial activation, Bid was found to be cleaved by ASC as a specific caspase-2 inhibitor inhibits the ASC-induced cleavage of Bid [351]. In addition, JNK was activated by ASC upstream of mitochondria via reactive oxygen species. Caspase-2 activation provides a possible link between the DNA damaging activity and the induction of apoptosis. To this end, ASC might be a valuable chemical tool to induce DNA damage and apoptotic signaling events.\n",

In different human cancer cell lines, both compounds inhibited colony formation, caused cell cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 \u03bcM. Although variolins induced an increase in the levels of p53 with an increase in p21, their cytotoxicities did not appear to be dependent on p53 status as their potency was comparable in cells with wild-type p53 or in sublines with inactivated p53. Both VAR-B and dVAR-B prevent the cells from entering S phase, blocking cells in G1 and cause an accumulation of cells in G2. The apoptosis induced by VAR-B and dVAR-B occurred very rapidly in some cell lines (e.g., Jurkat leukemia cells) and was already evident 4 h after the beginning of treatment. Although intercalation of dVAR-B in DNA has been demonstrated, neither VAR-B nor dVAR-B produces detectable breaks in DNA, which are consistent with the in vitro biochemical assays that also demonstrated that dVAR-B is not topoisomerase I or II poison. Instead, each of these variolins appears to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the lM range. CDK1-cyclin B, CDK2-cyclin A, and CDK2/cyclin E complexes were inhibited in a range of concentrations lower than those required to inhibit the activity of CDK4/cyclin D or CDK7/cyclin H complexes. Variolins are a new class of CDK inhibitors that activate apoptosis in a p53-independent fashion, and thus they may be effective against tumors with p53 mutations or deletions [352].\n",

Spongistatin 1 (Fig. 15.20) showed interesting apoptotic features in various tumor cells. In leukemic cell lines, it triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Spongistatin 1 caused degradation of the anti-apoptotic XIAP, which suggested it might be a promising drug for the treatment of chemoresistance due to overexpression of XIAP. Moreover spongistatin 1 induces apoptosis more efficiently in human primary leukemic cells of children suffering from acute leukemia at low nanomolar concentrations than clinically applied conventional drugs used in micromolar concentrations. In addition normal healthy peripheral blood cells were significantly less affected by spongistatin 1 [353]. Besides leukemic cells, spongistatin 1 showed promising apoptotic potential in mammary cancer cells including the treatment-resistant cell line MCF-7 lacking caspase-3. Regarding the apoptotic signaling pathways of spongistatin 1, two interesting features can be reported. First, spongistatin 1-induced cell death involves the pro-apoptotic proteins AIF and endonuclease G. Both proteins translocate from mitochondria to the nucleus and contribute to spongistatin 1-mediated apoptosis as shown via gene silencing. Second, spongistatin 1 acts as a tubulin-depolymerizing agent and is able to free the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim from its sequestration both by the microtubular complex and by the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Silencing of Bim by siRNA leads to a diminished translocation of AIF and endonuclease G to the nucleus and subsequently reduces rate of apoptosis. By using spongistatin 1 as a chemical tool, Bim has been suggested to be an important factor upstream of mitochondria by executing a central role in the caspase-independent apoptotic signaling pathway induced by spongistatin 1. These different apoptotic features indicate that the apoptosis signaling is cell line-specific. Finally, spongistatin 1 affects highly invasive pancreatic tumor cells by not only inhibiting their invasion and migration but also by inducing anoikis in these cells. Bcl-2 seems to be a major target for spongistatin 1 in these processes. Besides tumor cells, spongistatin inhibits angiogenic activity of endothelial cells via inhibition of PKC-a [354].\n",
