The AAV serotypes chosen were AAV1, for its ability to efficiently transduce the muscle [33]; AAV8, for its broad tropism [34]; and AAVrh32.33, a recently isolated variant that demonstrated a superior capacity to induce cellular immune responses to the transgene product [22, 35]. For both intramuscular and intradermal injection routes, anti-NiV G Ab were detected 4\u20136 weeks after the priming injection (Figure 1A and 1B); levels peaked between 8 and 12 weeks but then did not significantly change until 16 weeks after priming, except for AAV1 and AAV8 injected intramuscularly and intradermally, respectively. In general, humoral responses generated after intradermal injection were significantly lower than those observed after intramuscular injection, and only minor differences were observed among the 3 AAV serotypes. In contrast, AAV8 injected by the intramuscular route was superior to the 2 other serotypes in terms of kinetics and Ab level (Figure 1A). Both IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes were detected for each AAV serotype independently of the injection route (Figure 1C and 1D). However, AAV8 injection via the intramuscular route induced a dominant IgG2a response. Production of NAb against NiV followed the same kinetics, with the strongest and most rapid response obtained after injection of AAV8-NiV.G by the intramuscular route (data not shown).\n",

Because generation of transgene-specific immunity may result in elimination of AAV-transduced cells, we analyzed the persistence of an AAV8-NiV.G vector over time and compared it to an AAV8 vector encoding GFP that was reported to persistently express the transgene over time [35]. The measurement of AAV-GFP DNA copies in the injected muscles indicated that, after an initial drop 2\u20136 weeks after injection, the number of AAV-GFP copies remained stable for at least 16 weeks (Figure 2A). As expected, follow-up evaluation of AAV-NiV.G DNA indicated increased elimination of vector DNA 6 weeks after injection, compared with AAV-GFP samples. However, interestingly, AAV-NiV.G DNA levels remained stable thereafter, and quantification of NiV G RNA 16 weeks after injection indicated that the transgene was still expressed at a significant level (Figure 2B). These results confirmed that AAV vector DNA was still present and continued to express the transgene 16 weeks after injection.\n",

Animals were injected with the AAV8 NiV.G vector via the intramuscular route. The follow up of the anti-NiV G IgG response indicated a different kinetics than that observed in mice (Figure 3A), with an earlier onset of Ab production at 2 weeks, which peaked 4\u20136 weeks after injection, progressively declined until week 10, but remained stable thereafter. Moreover, as observed in mice, a dominant IgG2 response was induced (data not shown). The NAb levels before the challenge followed the same kinetics as the IgG levels. However the NAb levels remained stable until at least 12 weeks after injection, further suggesting the persistent induction of high-affinity NAb (Figure 3B).\n",

All control animals, which were injected with AAV8-GFP, developed clinical signs of infection on day 5 after challenge. In contrast, 100% of vaccinated animals survived until the end of the experiment, without appearance of clinical signs (Figure 3C). The level of anti-NiV NAb was analyzed using a different neutralization assay that was adapted to the BSL4 laboratory and based on the inhibition of the cytopathic effect induced by wild-type NiV on Vero cells (see Materials and Methods). Previous comparison of the 2 neutralization assays indicated a strong correlation between these methods even if the anti-NiV NAb titers calculated using wild-type NiV were, on average, 10\u201320-fold inferior to those observed using NiV VLPs (Supplementary Figure 2). This explains why prechallenge NAb levels were nearly undetectable by the wild-type NiV assay in 3 of 6 vaccinated animals (Table 1) despite detection of NAb by the NiV VLP assay (Figure 3B). The analysis of postchallenge sera indicated that 5 of 6 vaccinated animals did not develop a detectable anamnestic response (Table 1). As expected, NiV RNA was found in the lung, the spleen, and, at a lower level, the brain of control animals. In contrast, it was undetectable in the organs from all vaccinated animals, including animal NiV.G-5 (Figure 4A and Table 1). Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the absence of detectable NiV antigens in the organs of vaccinated animals (Supplementary Figure 3).\n",

In contrast, the NiV G protein is generally considered unable to induce cross-protective immunity against HeV [17, 32]. To evaluate this, animals vaccinated with AAV8-NiV.G were challenged with HeV. Follow up of the animals indicated that 3 of 6 survived the challenge (Figure 3D). As expected, none of the vaccinated animals had detectable anti-HeV cross-neutralizing NAb before challenge (Table 2). After challenge, only 1 of the 3 surviving animals (animal NiV.G-9) developed anti-HeV NAb. However, HeV RNA was not detected in the organs of any of the animals surviving the challenge (Table 2 and Figure 4B). Similarly, HeV antigens were not detected by immunohistochemistry analysis (Supplementary Figure S3). Together, these results strongly suggest that a single injection of the AAV8-NiV.G vector induced sterilizing immunity against NiV infection, as well as cross-protective immunity sufficient to protect 50% of the animals against a lethal challenge with HeV.",

            "text": "The first part of our study was focused on the characterization of the AAV-induced humoral response. We found that the AAV8 vector injected intramuscularly was the most efficient for producing anti-NiV G Ab (Figure 1A and 1C). In both intramuscular and intradermal routes, the kinetics of anti-NiV G Ab was characterized by delayed detection 4\u20136 weeks after injection and by a peak production 8\u201312 weeks after injection. This unusual lag phase was previously documented in other studies [23, 24] and likely reflects the time required for the conversion of the single-stranded AAV vector genome into a double-stranded DNA form able to express the transgene [47]. The use of double-stranded AAV vectors, which can circumvent this rate-limiting step and accelerate the synthesis of the antigen, may improve the kinetics of Ab production. Another major characteristic of AAV-induced humoral response in mice was its detection at a high level for an extended period (Figure 1). Many groups have similarly documented a persistent AAV-induced humoral response [21, 45, 46]. Analysis of vector persistence and expression in transduced tissues suggested that the persistent Ab level may be due to continued expression of the transgene (Figure 2). In contrast, the decline in IgG levels 5 weeks after injection in hamsters could be due to reduced vector persistence in this animal species (Figure 3A). Future studies comparing a range of AAV doses in hamsters and mice will indicate whether these differences are linked to the host species or to the vector dose. Finally, we observed that a boost injection with an alternative AAV serotype in mice did not significantly enhance the Ab level (Figure 1E and 1F). In contrast, several studies have documented the possibility of boosting the AAV-induced humoral response by using an adenoviral vector [22\u201324]. It is possible that a booster effect could be observed only if boosting is performed at a later time, when the humoral response induced by the priming injection has declined. Additional studies should also be performed to determine whether these observations can be transposed to other animal species.",

All vaccinated animals were protected against a lethal challenge with NiV (Figure 3C). The absence of NiV antigens (Supplementary Figure 3) and RNA (Figure 4A and Table 1) in the tissues, as well as the moderate anamnestic response observed in only 1 of 6 animals (Table 1), strongly suggested that this mode of vaccination induced sterilizing immunity. So far, only few vaccination studies reported the ability to induce sterilizing immunity. In particular, variable results were obtained using a soluble HeV G protein, suggesting that only high, repeated doses of the antigen, coupled with adjuvants, may completely prevent virus replication [12\u201315]. The induction of sterilizing immunity after a single AAV injection may reflect a unique contribution made by this vaccine approach, which certainly deserves future investigations.",

            "text": "NiV and HeV G proteins are 83% homologous [48, 49]. This level of homology suggests that a cross-neutralizing response can be induced. Accordingly, Ab against the HeV G protein have been reported to cross-neutralize NiV [37, 38, 50]. In contrast, the NiV G protein is considered unable to induce an efficient cross-protective response in vivo. This notion is mostly supported by in vitro neutralization assays showing that anti-NiV G Ab do not efficiently neutralize HeV. However, the potential cross-protective effect of anti-NiV G responses against HeV has not been evaluated so far. In this study, we observed that 50% of the animals vaccinated with AAV-NiV.G survived after a challenge with HeV (Figure 3D). This interesting result suggests that a low level of cross-neutralizing Ab against HeV not detectable by the neutralization assay (Table 2) may be induced after vaccination. Alternatively, it is possible that protection is conferred by the cell-mediated immune response. Even though cellular responses against henipavirus glycoproteins have not been characterized so far, cellular and particularly CD8+ T-cell responses may be induced and play a role in protecting the animals. Accordingly, induction of an adaptive T-helper 1 immune response against NiV G was suggested to occur following injection of canarypox virus vectors encoding NiV G in pigs [17]. Interestingly, intramuscular injection of AAV8-NiV.G induced a dominant IgG2a response in mice and hamsters that was not observed with other AAV serotypes nor via the intradermal route (Figure 1C and 1D). This result suggests that this capsid serotype may induce an anti-NiV G T-helper 1\u2013oriented immune response. A challenge performed at earlier time points or adoptive transfer of T cells should indicate the extent to which cellular responses against NiV G can protect against viral infection. These studies should include the AAVrh32.33 serotype, which was selected for its ability to induce a qualitatively and quantitatively superior cellular response [22].",
