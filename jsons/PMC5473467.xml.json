            "text": "Infections that cause diarrhoea are responsible for nearly 800,000 deaths every year, mostly among young children in resource-poor settings1. Recently, the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium was found to be one of the leading causes of infectious diarrhoea in children2,3, and infection with this parasite is strongly associated with mortality, growth stunting, and developmental deficits4. The major human pathogens causing cryptosporidiosis, C. hominis and C. parvum, infect the epithelial cells of the intestine and, through a mechanism that is not fully understood, trigger severe watery diarrhoeal symptoms. These are particularly long-lasting and often life-threatening in malnourished and immunocompromised children4. Nitazoxanide, the only approved drug for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, has limited efficacy in these most vulnerable patient populations5,6. Cryptosporidiosis is also a well-recognized opportunistic infection in adults with AIDS and transplant recipients4. Infection occurs through ingestion of the spore-like oocyst stage, which shows remarkable resistance to water chlorination. Therefore, even in countries that apply advanced water treatment, infection is common, and Cryptosporidium is the cause of 50% of disease outbreaks linked to recreational water use in the USA. The search for cryptosporidiosis therapeutics has been hindered by the many technical challenges faced when working with this notoriously intractable parasite7. Here we establish a drug-discovery screening process for cryptosporidiosis that combines phenotypic in vitro assays with novel animal models that take advantage of transgenic parasites8.",

Notably, many anti-malarials (spiroindolones9, cyclomarins10, and imidazolopiperazines11) lacked activity against Cryptosporidium; however, 154 compounds showed >60% growth inhibition at 5 \u03bcM. Secondary screening using a novel cytopathic effect (CPE)-based C. parvum assay confirmed several scaffolds, with imidazopyrazines12,13 and pyrazolopyridines14 showing sub-micromolar cellular activity (Fig. 1a\u2013d and Table 1; structures provided in Extended Data Fig. 1). We evaluated about 200 pyrazolopyridine analogues and found correlation between activity against C. parvum and Plasmodium falciparum (r2 = 0.702; Fig. 1d), suggesting that the mechanism of action of pyrazolopyridines is conserved between these two parasites. No such correlation was observed with toxicity against HepG2 (r2 = 0.071) (Extended Data Fig. 2). C. hominis is responsible for most clinical infections15. We thus evaluated a subset of pyrazolopyridine analogues against C. hominis, and found potency comparable to that against C. parvum (r2 = 0.872; Fig. 1e and Table 1).",

Further genetic and structural insights are needed to unambiguously establish PI4(K) as the target. However, we note that the Plasmodium PI(4)K inhibitors diaryl-aminopyridine (MMV390048)17 and quinoxaline (BQR695)12, which are inactive against C. parvum and C. hominis, do not inhibit CpPI(4)K enzymatic activity (Fig. 1f). Finally, mechanistic studies revealed an increased Km for ATP in the presence of KDU731 (Fig. 1h), suggesting ATP-competitive inhibition similar to that previously observed for the Plasmodium enzyme12. Additional structure\u2013activity relationship analysis of pyrazolopyridines against Cryptosporidium is found in the Supplementary Information.

In a battery of safety pharmacology assays, the compound does not show intrinsic risks for cardiotoxicity, mutagenicity, clastogenicity, or phototoxicity, and it does not bind significantly to a panel of human anti-targets (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). KDU731 safety was further evaluated in a 2-week toxicology study in rats using a solid dispersion formulation to maximize systemic exposure (~25-fold). In this study, no significant histopathological changes and only minor changes in clinical chemistry and haematology were observed (slight elevation of cholesterol and phosphate ions and increase in red blood cells, see Supplementary Information). Importantly, no haematopoietic toxicity related to potential inhibition of PI3K or PI4K lipid kinases was observed, suggesting that the in vitro selectivity of KDU731 translated to lack of host toxicity in vivo (Extended Data Table 1). Children with cryptosporidiosis in resource-limited settings frequently suffer comorbidities including HIV, tuberculosis, and other infections; anti-cryptosporidial drugs will thus probably be used along with other medications, and the risk of drug\u2013drug interactions needs to be minimized. Consistent with the requirement, KDU731 did not inhibit any of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and did not induce human pregnane X receptor (Extended Data Table 1).",

Next, we inoculated 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-knockout mice with 10,000 oocysts and monitored infection by following parasite-derived luciferase activity in the faeces (Fig. 2a). Infected mice were treated orally with KDU731 in suspension formulation and parasite load was measured in the pooled faeces by Nluc and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay with a high degree of correlation (Spearman coefficient = 0.786; two-tailed P = 0.048). The Nluc assay has a small sample requirement (20 mg) and thus could be conducted on individual mice as well as pooled faeces (unpaired t-test comparing means of individual and pooled readings showed no significant difference, two-tailed P = 0.3862). Importantly, KDU731 greatly reduced oocyst shedding regardless of assay method (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4b, c; non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, pooled Nluc two-tailed P < 0.001; faecal qPCR two-tailed P = 0.0042).

At the end of the treatment period, three mice per group were killed and intestines were processed for histology. We did not observe parasites in the intestines of treated animals, whereas those that received vehicle showed substantial infection (Fig. 2d).",

Additionally, treatment in neonatal calves, which closely matches the pathophysiological and pharmacological challenges faced in the treatment of young malnourished children, led to a significant decrease in parasite shedding and rapid resolution of diarrhoea and dehydration. Our lead candidate, KDU731, displays good anti-cryptosporidial activity and meets a broad range of safety and pharmacology criteria required for a much-needed novel cryptosporidiosis therapeutic intervention.

Pharmacokinetic studies in monkeys (n = 3) were performed in rhesus macaques as described16. Neonatal calf pharmacokinetic studies were performed as part of the efficacy study on day 1 and day 7 of treatment. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the respective institutional animal care and use committees. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was determined on the basis of the minimum number of animals required for good data distribution and statistics. Blinding was not possible in these experiments but animals were selected randomly for each group. KDU731 was formulated in suspension formulation for per os dosing and solution formulation for intravenous dosing as described in Extended Data Table 3. For rat toxicology studies, KDU731 was formulated in solid dispersion. KDU731 (20%) and the required excipients (37.5% Soluplus, 37.5% Eudragit E PO, and 5% SLS) were dissolved in ethanol/dichloromethane (v/v = 1:1) at a total solid concentration of 10 g l\u22121 by sonication and heating to 50 \u00b0C.

The amorphous nature was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis and powder was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Solid dispersion powder suspension was prepared freshly in 0.5% HPMC in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.7) at 10 mg ml\u22121 of KDU731 (equivalent to solid dispersion powder 50 mg ml\u22121) and rats were dosed within 1 h of preparation. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic studies were collected between 0 and 24 h post-dose. Compound plasma concentrations were determined by LC/MS. Plasma samples from pharmacokinetic studies were extracted with acetonitrile:methanol:acetic acid (90:9.8:0.2) containing warfarin as an internal standard, using an 8.8:1 extractant to plasma ratio. Analyte quantitation was performed by LC/MS/MS. Liquid chromatography was performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system, with an Agilent Zorbax Phenyl (3.5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7 75 mm) column at an oven temperature of 45 \u00b0C, coupled with a API4000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems).

Assuming a type I error risk of 5% and a type II error risk of 80%, seven calves were needed in the treatment group, plus two positive controls. In the event of calf death or removal from the study, an additional four calves were added to the control group (n = 6). Sample size was calculated using Epi Info. Fifteen Friesian\u2013Holstein bull calves were enrolled in November 2015 and February 2016. At birth, all calves enrolled in November were randomized to treatment with KDU731 (n = 7), positive infection control (n = 2), and negative infection control (n = 1). The five calves enrolled in February were positive controls. The perineum of the dam was cleaned with povidone\u2013iodine scrub, and calves were delivered onto single-use plastic sheets to prevent exposure to environmental pathogens. Calves with abnormal physical examination findings and those weighing less than 29.5 kg at birth were excluded. Enrolled calves received 4 l \u2265 50 g IgG/l commercial colostrum replacer (Land O\u2019Lakes) and a 3 ml subcutaneous injection of vitamin E and selenium (Merck Animal Health).

Calves were induced to suckle and then KDU731 was given orally via an oral dosing syringe. Calves were treated every 12 h for 7 days at a dose of 5 mg per kg birthweight at least 2 h after feeding. Pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted on day 1 and day 7 of treatment. Blood was drawn before and at multiple time-points after administration. A faecal sample was collected 1 h and 12 h after administration. On days 2\u20136 of treatment, blood was collected before KDU731 administration. On day 3 of life, a faecal sample was tested for E. coli K99, and on day 7 for Salmonella, rotavirus, and corona virus. Of the seven treatment calves, two (N101 and N107) were randomly selected to be euthanized 24 h after administration of the final KDU731 treatment. A positive control calf (N104) was also euthanized at the same time. Euthanasia was by captive bolt and induction of bilateral pneumothorax to avoid confounding histological findings. Calves were submitted for necropsy to the Washington State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Samples of the liver, spleen, kidney, and small intestine were collected for histological analysis. The remaining calves continued in the study until the cessation of faecal oocyst shedding as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Merifluor, Meridian Diagnostics). Upon cessation of faecal oocyst shedding (two consecutive negative faecal samples over 48 h), calves were euthanized and submitted to the Washington State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for necropsy.",
