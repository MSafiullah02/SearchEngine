The output of this amplification technique includes multiple different sizes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structures which are identified by a banding pattern on gel electrophoresis plots. Although this is a specific amplification technique, the complexity of the primer design and amplification still lead to the issue of obtaining false-positive results, especially when a positive reading is determined solely by whether there is any banding pattern in the gel electrophoresis plot. Here, we first performed extensive LAMP experiments and evaluated the DNA structures using microchip electrophoresis. We then developed a mathematical model derived from the various components that make up an entire LAMP structure to predict the full LAMP structure size in base pairs. This model can be implemented by users to make predictions for specific, DNA size dependent, banding patterns on their gel electrophoresis plots. Each prediction is specific to the target sequence and primers used and therefore reduces incorrect diagnosis errors through identifying true-positive and false-positive results. This model was accurately tested with multiple primer sets in house and was also translatable to different DNA and RNA types in previously published literature.

There are a variety of DNA amplification techniques used to increase the quantity of target DNA fragments for diagnostics. One commonly used method of DNA amplification is PCR. This technique works by using three different temperatures to amplify the DNA [1] . Due to the restrictions that the temperature cycling needed to run PCR places on equipment and experimental setup, there has been an emphasis on developing DNA amplification techniques that can be performed at one temperature, or isothermally. Isothermal techniques to note are loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification, and nucleic acid sequence-based displacement by the forward inner primer (FIP) primer hybridizing F2 to the primer binding site at F2c (Step 2) [5] . The inner primers are made up of two parts, one with the sense (5 to 3 ) and one with the antisense (3 to 5 ) strand complementary to the template DNA [5] . Strand displacing DNA polymerase separates the dsDNA and creates a new copy of the template DNA starting from the inner primer [5] . Hybridization of the forward outer primer (F3) to its respective primer binding site (F3c) then creates another new copy of the template while displacing the ssDNA created from the inner primer (Step 3) [5] . Nucleotides are added to the F3 3 end which releases the single strand of DNA including the FIP primer and the F1 and F1c sites are bound together using hydrogen bonds, creating a self-hybridizing, single-stranded loop (Step 4) . This is then used as a template to repeat this process on the opposite end of the DNA structure with new, corresponding backward inner and outer primers, culminating in the production of a dumbbell structure (Steps 5-7) [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 879, "end": 882, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1039, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1172, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1381, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1611, "text": "(Step 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1837, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Next, LAMP cycling begins with extension from the 3 end of the dumbbell structure, creating the first 'stem and loop' structure (Step 8). A new FIP primer binds to the F2c primer binding site (Step 9) and a new strand of DNA makes a copy of the stem and loop structure which creates a new loop between B1c and B1 primer binding sites (Step 10). Lastly, nucleotides are added to the 3 end of DNA structure again which releases the newly created strand of DNA which will fold into a dumbbell structure and new stem and loop LAMP structure is also created which has an additional target sequence from the previous structure (Step 11). The newly created stem and loop DNA structure is used as another template for LAMP cycling using one inner primer at a time, either FIP or BIP [5] . The overall result of LAMP can make 10 9 copies of the target DNA when starting from a few copies within an hour [5] . This efficient amplification is a major advantage of LAMP, as well as its ability to produce these DNA copies all under isothermal conditions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 775, "end": 778, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 894, "end": 897, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Currently, LAMP has been widely used for infectious disease diagnostic applications where the researcher's main objective is to correctly identify positive and negative LAMP reactions to identify a specific disease [6] [7] [8] . A positive LAMP reaction indicates that the target DNA sequence, representing a disease or other diagnosis such as human influenza viruses H1 or H3 [9] , has been amplified, and therefore identified in that sample. A negative LAMP reaction indicates that the sample does not contain that target sequence since it has not been identified and amplified in the reaction, therefore leading to a negative reaction and a negative diagnosis. Here, the focus is on better understanding the DNA structures that are created through this amplification technique since, unlike PCR, DNA copies created through LAMP are dissimilar in size. This investigation is done using mathematical modeling to predict the size of different DNA Mathematical modeling for LAMP has been used once previously to quantify the LAMP amplification process [10] . This model uses the concentration versus time curves of LAMP experiments to determine the time-to-positive (T p ) of LAMP samples which is considered equivalent to the threshold cycling time in PCR reactions [10] . Here, an alternative approach to better understand the amplification process is provided. This new mathematical model makes it possible to instead predict the banding pattern associated with positive LAMP samples during gel electrophoresis. A major benefit of this model is that it creates a user-friendly prediction method for positive LAMP samples which allows for false-positive reactions to be more easily identified and increases researchers' understanding on different DNA products in the reaction. The developed mathematical model fills a gap in the research on LAMP as a simple, easy to use tool that quickly recognizes false-positive LAMP reactions. Since the stem and loop structures created through LAMP are complex in nature, creating this simple tool can be relatively difficult [11] . In conventional PCR, researchers can predict the output DNA sizes of their amplified product in a true-positive reaction based on the location of the forward and reverse primers on the template DNA. The complexity of the LAMP process has not allowed for that same predictive method. However, this mathematical model is a new tool that now allows researchers to make those same predictions for the sizes of the different amplified products produced through a true-positive LAMP reaction based on the target and primer sizes. Similar to recognizing true-positive reactions on gel electrophoresis plots for PCR, this model allows researchers to quickly recognize true-positive and false-positive amplification for LAMP because they will know what the correct banding pattern should be. Thus, if the gel electrophoresis plot shows an alternative banding pattern, the researchers can identify the sample as a false-positive which can help to reduce the likelihood of an incorrect diagnosis. Current methods to reduce the chance of false-positive LAMP reactions include optimizing LAMP reactions using multiple runs and techniques to find true positive results [12, 13] or using more intricate methods such as molecular beacons that only fluoresce when bound to target DNA or restriction enzyme digestions [5, 9, 14] . Overall, this mathematical model helps to create a predictive method for researchers to implement into their LAMP experimental design that is of no extra cost to them, uses information already gathered during LAMP primer designing, and reduces the likelihood of false-positive diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 218, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 219, "end": 222, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 223, "end": 226, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 377, "end": 380, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1270, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2069, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3227, "end": 3231, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3232, "end": 3235, "text": "13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3372, "end": 3375, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3376, "end": 3378, "text": "9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3379, "end": 3382, "text": "14]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The LAMP analysis conducted in this study used M13mp18 (GenBank Accession #: X02513) as the template DNA.

Additionally, with a starting concentration of 400 ng, the average structure size also fell outside of the range of the Bioanalyzer sensitivity at 438 bp where the predicted size is 464 bp which may also be explained by the same principles used for the Stem and Loop \u00d73 structure. Overall, it is hypothesized that concentration does not affect the validity of this model since each of these concentrations had a similar result with Stem and Loop \u00d73, although a starting concentration of 400 ng did produce an additional structure size outside of the sensitivity of the Bioanalyzer. One way to test how these specific structures fell outside of the respective predicted ranges would be to increase the experiment time to confirm all structure elongation has occurred.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 141, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 192, "end": 199, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "Effect of varying starting DNA concentrations"}, {"text": "The original LAMP primer design did not include loop primers so that the LAMP amplification could be kept as simple as possible for the predictive model development.

The same predicted sizes from Table 4 were also used in this testing analysis. The result of adding the loop primers showed that 100% of the LAMP structures still fell within the range of the Bioanalyzer sensitivity, results are presented in Table 5 . The only significant difference when using the loop primer mix was that each of these reactions also showed a peak on the electropherograms around 75 bp which is hypothesized to be caused by a primer dimer formation, caused by primers binding to themselves and amplifying. One reason why a primer dimer may be found when using the loop primer mix is because there is now a larger concentration of LAMP primers starting in the reaction, therefore it is possible that some may bind to each other, rather than existing LAMP structures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 484, "end": 491, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 525, "end": 532, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 737, "end": 744, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Effect of including loop primers in the LAMP primer mix"}, {"text": "To further confirm the validity of this mathematical model, a new set of LAMP primers were designed and tested (FIP-2, BIP-2, F3-2, B3-2, Table 1 ) while keeping all other testing conditions the same as the optimized LAMP primers testing.

Additionally, there was a gel electrophoresis plot to compare the mathematically derived predictions to so that there could be an evaluation regarding whether the model worked or not. A benefit of using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 for this study is that exact base pair values were exported for every peak, for every LAMP sample. In other literature on LAMP, most studies are not analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, but with standard gel electrophoresis, therefore experimental values are written as an approximation if not otherwise specified by the author of that study.

The simple 2-state model means that the nucleic acid sequence is either folded in the configuration shown, or entirely single stranded [16] . According to Zuker, to test the 2-state model, the sequences can be refolded, using MFold, near the respec-tive predicted T m values, and if the new T m is 'significantly' larger than the original, this would imply that the molecule can be refolded into another geometry at a larger T m [16] . To test whether these structures could be refolded into another geometry, the stem and loop and stem and loop \u00d72 sequences were rerun using MFold under the same conditions other than a new temperature setting at 95\u00b0C. The T m values of the stem and loop and stem and loop \u00d72 structures during the first test were 95.2 and 97.8\u00b0C, respectively. These temperatures were near to the final heating temperature used experimentally, 95\u00b0C, so this temperature was selected for the new testing.
