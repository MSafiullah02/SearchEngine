Previous research only suggested obesity in general, based on the individual body mass index (BMI), as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, without making a distinction between subcutaneous and visceral fat. However, next to overall obesity, body fat distribution is an important risk factor for cardio-metabolic outcomes (1, 2) . Especially visceral fat accumulation is often associated with metabolic syndrome, conferring an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes with a subsequently enhanced morbidity (1, 2) . Furthermore, while BMI is currently the most frequently used indicator for assessing overweight/obesity in adults with a high specificity, it has an inherent low sensitivity to identify excess fat mass and cannot distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous fat (3) . Here, computed tomography (CT) with non-invasive post-processing applications allows for differentiation between and quantification of visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue and thus for a reliable assessment of body fat distribution (4) . Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat of patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection based on routinely acquired low dose chest CTs and to correlate these results with the rate of hospitalization in ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation as severe clinical courses.",

For CAP, the collimation used was 80 x 0.5 mm, for GEL, it was 64 x 0.625 mm. Pitch factors were 1.388 (CAP) and 1.375 (GEL). Non-enhanced scans were performed in deep inspiration with caudocranial spiral acquisition and supine positioning of the patient. We reconstructed 0.5 mm (CAP) and 0.625 mm (GEL) axial slices in soft tissue and lung kernel reconstruction (CAP: Fc01 and Fc85, GEL: \"standard\" and \"lung\"), using iterative reconstruction technology (CAP: AIDR3D level \"moderate\", GEL: ASIR 50%).",

Hence, CT-based quantification of visceral adipose tissue might be used as a simple tool for risk assessment in SARS-CoV-2 patients from routinely acquired chest CTs.",
