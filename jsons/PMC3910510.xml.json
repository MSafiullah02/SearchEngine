            "text": "Most facilitated transport of proteins through the NPC requires soluble transport receptors and a transport signal. Proteins targeted into or out of the nucleus interact with transport receptors via a short amino acid motif, named nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES), respectively 1. Soluble transport receptors termed karyopherins (also known as importins, exportins, transportins and snurportin) are multidomain transport factors that bind to cargo through its cargo\u2010binding domain. Karyopherin \u03b1 (Kap\u03b1) recognizes so\u2010called classical NLS motifs, whereas karyopherin \u03b2 (Kap\u03b2) interacts with non\u2010classical NLS sequences such as the PY\u2010NLS motif, which is found in structurally disordered regions of proteins and contains invariant proline and tyrosine residues in the Kap\u03b2 recognition sequence 1, 12. Karyopherins also contain an NPC\u2010binding domain(s) and an N\u2010terminal\u2010binding domain for the small GTPase Ran, which interacts with the karyopherin to regulate the association and dissociation of the transport receptor\u2013cargo complex. Ran acts a molecular switch and alternates between GDP\u2010 and GTP\u2010bound states. In its GTP form, interaction of Ran with import complexes results in their dissociation. On the other hand, formation of export complexes requires Ran in its GTP\u2010bound state 1. Conversion between the GDP\u2010 and GTP\u2010bound forms of Ran is regulated by the cytoplasmic GTPase\u2010activating protein (RanGAP) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RanGEF), which is located at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC 1, 5, 13. Thus, RanGDP is found in the cytoplasm, whereas RanGTP is primarily nuclear. The asymmetric distribution of these regulatory factors creates a Ran gradient across the nuclear envelope that is fundamental for the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport. During import, karyopherins facilitate the transport of cargo across the NPC. Once in the nucleus, RanGTP stimulates the dissociation of the karyopherin\u2013cargo complex. For export, karyopherin\u2013cargo complex formation is stimulated by RanGTP and results in the translocation of the complex through the NPC. In the cytoplasm, hydrolysis of RanGTP to its GDP state results in the dissociation of the karyopherin\u2013cargo complex 1. Here, we discuss how viruses disrupt these protein transport pathways to manipulate cellular processes and inhibit host antiviral mechanisms to facilitate viral replication (Figure 1).",

Infection of mammalian cells with PV and HRV results in the cytoplasmic mislocalization of cellular proteins bearing a classical NLS, which requires the Kap\u03b1/Kap\u03b21 import pathway 14, 15. In addition, cytoplasmic relocalization of M9 NLS\u2010containing host proteins, which requires the Kap\u03b22/transportin1 nuclear import pathway, was also observed during PV and HRV infection 14, 15. These and other studies revealed that infection with PV and HRV resulted in the proteolytic degradation of several nucleoporins, including Nup62, Nup98 and Nup153, and possibly other factors, by the viral\u2010expressed 2A protease (2Apro) 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. In fact, inhibiting the PV 2Apro suppressed the relocalization of cellular proteins, demonstrating that this effect is 2Apro\u2010dependent 17. An in\u2010depth analysis of different rhinovirus species revealed that 2Apro targeted Nup62, Nup98 and Nup153 for proteolysis, albeit the rate and sites of cleavage were different 20. Moreover, the HRV 3C protease (3Cpro) and its precursor form, 3CD, also target nucleoporins such as Nup153, Nup214 and Nup358 for degradation, leading to disruption of NPC permeability and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and mislocalization of nuclear proteins 21. Thus, both PV and HRV target nucleoporins to alter the composition of the NPC and trafficking of proteins into and out of the nucleus, which may function as a mechanism to inhibit host antiviral defense pathways by disrupting the translocation of important cellular proteins involved in immunity.",

Truncation mutants of the VP24 protein revealed that amino acids 26\u201350 are important for its ability to block IFN\u2010\u03b2 expression 26. Mechanistically, VP24 specifically binds to the PY\u2010STAT1 nuclear transport receptor Kap\u03b11 and disrupts the formation of the Kap\u03b1\u2010PY\u2010STAT1 transport complex, preventing PY\u2010STAT1 nuclear translocation 27.

The EMCV leader (L) protein, a non\u2010enzymatic viral component, disrupts nuclear transport of proteins by binding and suppressing the activity of Ran\u2010GTPase, thus altering the Ran gradient that is essential for the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport 33, 34. In addition, EMCV infection results in Nup62, Nup153 and Nup214 hyperphosphorylation in an L protein\u2010dependent manner, which may alter the integrity of and/or transport receptor\u2013cargo complex binding to the NPC 34. The hyperphosphorylation of Nups and disruption of the RanGTP gradient represent an alternative mechanism by which EMCV effectively interferes with nucleocytoplasmic trafficking compared to the proteolytic activity associated with other picornaviruses discussed above 34. Similarly, infection with mengovirus, a positive\u2010stranded RNA picornavirus, results in the hyperphosphorylation of Nup62 in an L protein\u2010dependent manner, which may also alter host nuclear import and export pathways 35. Moreover, EMCV infection results in increased NPC permeability and enhanced relocalization of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm of infected cells 36. These effects on nucleocytoplasmic transport were shown to require the zinc finger motif and phosphorylation of the threonine 47 (Thr47) residue of the EMCV leader protein 36.

The steps of mRNA processing and export are closely linked, as some proteins that interact with mRNAs remain bound throughout both processes, whereas others are exchanged for factors specific for each step 93. NS1 inhibits pre\u2010mRNA splicing by binding to the U6 snRNA component of the spliceosome and/or through interactions with the putative splicing protein NS1\u2010BP 94, 95. NS1 further disrupts host mRNA processing by binding to the 30\u2010kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) and the poly(A)\u2010binding protein II (PABII), which are involved in binding the polyadenylation signal and in the elongation of the poly(A) chain of mRNAs, respectively 96, 97. The interaction of NS1 with these proteins inhibits 3\u2032\u2010end processing of host mRNAs and contributes to inhibition of host gene expression. However, production of viral transcripts is unaffected by NS1\u2010mediated disruption of mRNA processing because poly(A) tail synthesis on viral mRNAs is carried out by the viral polymerase complex 98, 99. Additionally, NS1 may facilitate splicing of the viral M1 mRNA segment by interacting with the host mRNA\u2010binding proteins, NS1\u2010BP (NS1\u2010binding protein) and hnRNP K 100. This permits efficient processing of viral mRNA transcripts before nuclear export occurs. In addition to disrupting host mRNA processing, IAV further disrupts expression of host antiviral genes via NS1 interactions with the host mRNA export machinery. NS1 interacts with the mRNA export factors NXF1\u2010NXT1, which form a complex with Rae1 and E1B\u2010AP5, preventing nuclear export of poly(A) RNA 101. Altogether, these studies show that NS1 of IAV employs several mechanisms to inhibit the connected and highly regulated processes of mRNA processing and export. Interestingly, mRNAs encoding antiviral factors are retained in the nucleus owing to NS1\u2010mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export 102, indicating that disruption of these pathways likely represents a viral strategy to promote viral replication and avoid the host immune response.",

            "text": "Certain RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm also inhibit host mRNA nuclear export. Vesiculoviruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), are negative\u2010stranded RNA viruses that prevent proper mRNA export through the action of the VSV matrix (M) protein 45, 69, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, resulting in inhibition of host gene expression. This effect decreases competition of VSV mRNAs with host mRNAs for use of the translational machinery. Similar to IAV infection, blockage of mRNA export by VSV also prevents expression of mRNAs that encode antiviral factors 102. The M protein contains NLSs that allow its import into the nucleus, where it exerts its inhibitory function on mRNA export 104, 107. Once inside the nucleus, M protein interacts with the mRNA export factor Rae1, which is in complex with Nup98 69, 105. This prevents export of bulk poly(A) mRNAs during VSV infection. It has been reported that the interaction of M protein with Rae1 and Nup98 inhibits host transcription 108. However, high levels of polyadenylated RNA are retained inside the nucleus in the presence of M protein indicating complete mRNA synthesis, as shown by various methods including nucleocytoplasmic fractionation followed by microarray analysis and real\u2010time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 102, oligo\u2010dT in situ hybridization 45, 69, 105, 106 and mRNA nuclear export assays in Xenopus oocytes 103, 104, 105, 106. These results indicate that M protein utilizes post\u2010transcriptional mechanisms to inhibit gene expression. Transcriptional studies are necessary to investigate whether M protein regulates expression of certain subsets, rather than the general population, of mRNAs. This is possible, as Nup98 has been shown to regulate transcription of subsets of genes 109, 110.",

Another possibility is that Rae1\u2013Nup98 may facilitate export of bulk NXF1\u2010mediated mRNA export.

Genome\u2010wide studies that identify mRNAs that are directly targeted by the Rae1\u2013Nup98 complex at early stages of infection as well as additional biochemical studies on the interaction of M protein with the mRNA export machinery will further reveal the mechanism of action of VSV M protein.",

Two adenoviral protein products, E1B\u201055K and Ad E4 open reading frame 6 (E4orf6), have been shown to mediate the degradation of cellular proteins that may have a deleterious effect on viral propagation 117. The interaction of E1B\u201055K and E4orf6 with host proteins results in the formation of a complex with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that may contribute to inhibition of host mRNA export and promotion of late viral mRNA export from the nucleus 118, 119. In one model, it was proposed that the E1B\u201055K and E4orf6 ubiquitin ligase activity promotes the degradation of an as of yet unidentified cellular protein involved in host mRNA export 118. Another possibility is that E1B\u201055K disrupts NXF1\u2010mediated host mRNA export by binding to E1B\u2010AP5, a member of the RNP family that interacts with NXF1 63.

These findings attest to the importance of these pathways in proviral and antiviral mechanisms. As such, nuclear import and export pathways are enticing targets for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Recently, screens for small\u2010molecule inhibitors of the NS1 protein of IAV revealed both unique virus/host interactions and potentially useful antiviral strategies 130, 131. In one study, a high\u2010throughput screen was performed to identify small molecules that could antagonize NS1\u2010mediated inhibition of host gene expression. One of the compounds identified interfered with infection of several viruses by inducing the expression of REDD1 (also known as DDIT4), an inhibitor of the mTORC1 pathway that is required for IAV infection 130, 132. Overexpression of REDD1 resisted IAV infection while REDD1 knockout cells were more permissive to viral replication, demonstrating a role for REDD1 as a host defense factor. Interestingly, a second compound identified in the same screen uncovered a new link between pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways and mRNA nuclear export. This compound, a quinoline carboxylic acid, directly inhibited the host enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which is required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis but not for synthesis of pyrimidines via the salvage pathway. Thus, pyrimidine synthesis is not totally shut down and cytotoxicity does not occur upon compound treatment. The inhibition of DHODH led to an increase in NXF1 expression and subsequent relief of mRNA export block mediated by both IAV NS1 and VSV M proteins 102. The compound inhibited viral replication owing to the reduction of pyrimidine pools that viruses need to execute robust viral transcription and the release of host mRNA export block, which resulted in expression of antiviral factors 102, 133. Simultaneously, host cells maintained homeostasis by utilizing the salvage pathway or pyrimidines derived from the partially inhibited de novo biosynthesis pathway 102, 133.",
