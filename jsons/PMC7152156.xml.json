A high aspect ratio, high surface area, rich surface chemistry, neutral electrostatic potential, extremely high drug cargo ability, and excellent material properties, such as ultimate electrical and thermal conductivities and mechanical strength, make them an attractive tool for biomedical applications (Lu et al., 2009). They are regarded as a third allotropic form of carbon with a typical length-to-diameter ratio of up to 28,000,000:1. Individual CNTs differ from each other in the number of carbon atoms, such as C20, C30, C36, C70, and C78, and each of these individual members is called \u201cgraphene.\u201d These hollow cylindrical tubes are thus arranged in a specific pattern to form hexagonal structural units. This is primarily responsible for a high tensile strength of 150 Gpa which in turn leads to higher C\u2013C bond stiffness of the network (Awasthi et al., 2005).\n",

Their discovery went unnoticed as the article was published in Russian with a low circulation. Subsequently, Bacon in 1956, while investigating the properties of carbon fibers in parma, observed CNTs in his samples. He later presented his observations in 1960 wherein he described these carbon nanowhiskers as scroll-like structures (Bacon, 1960). In the 1970s, CNTs were produced and imaged during the production of carbon fibers by pyrolysis of benzene and ferrocene at 1000 \u00b0C. These were referred to as single-walled nanotubes (Obelin and Endo, 1976). Following this discovery, a group of Soviet scientists published the chemical and structural properties of CNTs produced by thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide. Howard G Tennent was granted a US patent in 1987 for Hyperion Catalysis in the production of \u201ccylindrical discrete carbon fibrils\u201d with a constant diameter between 3.5 and 70 nm (Tennent, 1987).",

He described them as allotropes of carbon with a hollow cylindrical-tube-shaped structure (Iijima, 1991). Two years later Iijima and coworkers, and Bethune and coworkers, independently observed single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs; Bethune et al., 1993, Iijima and Ichihashi, 1993).

            "text": "CNTs can be broadly classified into two types based on their wall structure, that is, SWCNTs and MWCNTs (Foldvari and Bagonluri, 2008). In SWCNTs, a single graphene sheet is folded to form a cylindrical closed structure, whereas in case of MWCNTs, around 3\u20135 sheets of single-walled nanotubes are rolled upon each other to form a multilayered structure. In addition, the SWCNTs may further be categorized based on the differences in the arrangements of their carbon atoms. The armchair arrangement is typically characterized by the chairs perpendicular to the tube axis, whereas a V-shape perpendicular to the tube axis is characteristic of the zigzag arrangement. The unique electrical, conductive properties and metallic characteristics are primarily determined by their degree of chirality. This forms the basis of designing a variety of nanoelectronic and diagnostic instruments (Tessonnier and Su, 2011). Beside structural differences, the CNTs also differ from each other dimensionally. A coaxial structure, containing two concentric graphene cylinders with higher thermal and chemical stability than single-walled nanotubes has been explored recently. These are termed double-walled CNTs. Apart from this, several variants in CNT shapes have been seen including carbon nanohorns (CNHs), nanobuds, and nanotorus, which have enormous applications in drug delivery due to the suitability of their characteristic modified structure. Figure 15.1\ndiagrammatically depicts the various types of CNTs employed in drug delivery.",

Forces that govern such adsorption are the hydrophobic and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions between the chains of the adsorbed molecules and the surfaces of CNTs. In the case of lipophilic drug moieties, the hydrophobic forces are the main driving forces for the loading of such drugs into or onto CNTs. The presence of charge on the nanotube surface due to chemical treatment can enable the adsorption of the charged molecules through ionic interactions (Liu et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2002). Noncovalent functionalization of CNTs is particularly attractive as it offers the possibility of attaching chemical modifications without affecting the electronic network of the tubes. Such functionalization can be achieved simply by exposing the CNTs to vapors containing functionalization species that noncovalently bond to the nanotube surface. Using this functionalization process, surfactants, polymers, and biomolecules like DNA, siRNA, proteins, and peptides can be successfully loaded onto the surfaces of CNTs (Figure 15.5\n).\n",

In order to achieve such functionalization, CNTs can be oxidized using strong acids, resulting in the reduction of their length while generating carboxylic groups, thus increasing their dispersibility in aqueous solutions. Alternatively, addition reactions of hydrophilic groups to the CNTs external walls and tips can also make them soluble in water. To achieve such a type of functionalization with therapeutic molecules like methotrexate, chemical reactions like 1,3-cycloaddition can be employed. Complete control over such chemo- or region-selective additions, however, is somewhat tricky to achieve, as it involves particular groups such as cyclic compounds, halogens, arynes, or carbenes. Moreover, such reactions often require extreme conditions for covalent bonding. Further, characterization of such functionalized nanotubes to determine the precise functionalization location and mode of addition are also very difficult. It may broadly be classified as end-defect functionalization or side-wall functionalization. End-defect functionalization involves oxidation at the \u201cend\u201d tips, whereas covalent binding of surfactants, proteins, and peptides on the surface of CNTs is referred to as side-wall functionalization.

Monoclonal antibody-functionalized SWCNTs have been employed for tumor targeting and for diagnostic imaging. An important prerequisite is the compatibility of the CNTs with the targeting antibodies as well as nanotubes. Also, the antigenicity of antibodies must remain unaltered after their attachment to the nanotubes and subsequently to their desired site of action. In addition, this approach can be employed for the delivery of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. One of the functionalization techniques, that is, PEGylation, has recently gained immense importance owing to its enhanced biocompatibility, solubility, and reduced toxicity (Bottini et al., 2011). In addition, monoclonal antibodies on SWCNTs functionalized with PEG have the distinct ability to target the CD20 cell surface receptor on B-cells selectively.

The biggest challenge, therefore, is to treat malignant cells without their \u201cspillover\u201d to neighboring cells. Conventional chemotherapy has the disadvantage of nonspecificity and in more than 99% of cases normal cells are destroyed along with the cancerous tissues. CNTs, in this regard, have been investigated for in vivo distribution and highly effective tumor targeting for cancer therapy in mice. Investigations are being done on the biodistribution of radio-labeled SWCNTs in mice by in vivo positron emission tomography, ex vivo biodistribution, and Raman spectroscopy. It has been found that SWCNTs that are functionalized with phospholipids bearing polyethylene glycol (PEG) are surprisingly stable in vivo. CNTs loaded with chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to achieve relatively higher uptake by cancerous tissue without affecting collateral tissues. Consequently, nanotubes may also be beneficial in dosage reduction by localizing dose distribution at the tumor site. This can further be fortified by functionalizing the drug-containing CNTs with an antibody molecule and targeting it to the antigen of cancer cells. Recently, CNTs have been reported to exhibit their own cancer-curing properties as well when exposed to an infrared light source (Zhou et al., 2009). Such heated tubes, especially MWCNTs, when placed at a tumor site, specifically destroy malignant cells and seem to act as a tumoricidal agent.",

Attempts have been made for treating gene defects by transporting grafted genes with the help of nanotubes (Pan et al., 2009). Ammonium-functionalized CNTs have been demonstrated to enhance gene therapy in comparison with DNA alone (Prato et al., 2008). Research has also indicated that siRNA and SWCNT complex can be easily taken up by splenic immune-recognizing cells such as CD11c+ cells, CD11b+ cells, and Gr-1+CD11b+ cells to induce the immune response for the particular gene. It has also been observed that when single-stranded DNA is bound to SWCNTs, DNA probes are protected from enzymatic cleavage and interference from nucleic-acid-binding proteins. Studies have shown that an SWCNT-modified DNA probe can target a specific mRNA inside living cells, thus causing increased self-delivery capability and intracellular biostability, compared with free DNA probes. In contrast to the traditional methods available for gene delivery, CNTs provide distinct advantages like enhanced capability to penetrate into the cells owing to their needle-like shape, hydrophobic surface, and their electrical properties. In addition, their capacity to achieve controlled release, influence on transitions of DNA/siRNA, and ability to monitor the therapeutic effects provides this conjugate with great potential for applications in the field of genetic engineering (Cheung et al., 2010).",

Recently, functionalized CNTs have shown promising outcomes in the treatment of these diseases owing to their ability to easily conjugate drugs like amphotericin B (Vinoth et al., 2015), dapsone, etc. (Mehra et al., 2015). Conjugation of AmB to these f-CNTs has been shown to have reduced toxicity and enhanced antimycotic efficiency. In addition, their targeted deliveries to macrophage cells have also been indicated by researchers. Furthermore, CNTs themselves might possess antimicrobial activity as bacteria, such as Escherichia coli may be absorbed onto the surface of the CNTs. The CNT might induce oxidation of the intercellular oxidant glutathione, resulting in increased oxidative stress on the bacterial cells and thus eventual cell death.",

Early systemic exposure of MWCNTs causes temporary organ injury, particularly to lungs and heart, attributable largely to their delayed clearance from the body due to strong agglomeration. Persistent accumulation of agglomerated MWCNTs in the lungs initiates inflammatory events (Takagi et al., 2008). Similarly, SWCNTs have been found to affect the CNS due to a high degree of accumulation in the spinal cord or dorsal root ganglia. Furthermore, SWCNTs significantly decrease the DNA content when the cells were exposed to disperse SWCNT bundles due to their accumulation in the nuclear material. Also, exposure to SWCNTs has resulted in ultrastructural and morphological changes in cultured skin cells (Yacobi et al., 2007). Comparative evaluation of toxicity studies has revealed that MWCNTs are more toxic as compared to SWCNTs, and induce massive loss of cell viability through programmed cell death. This toxicity of MWCNTs is primarily due to oxidative stress, cellular toxicity due to formation of free radicals, accumulation of peroxidative products, antioxidant depletion, and loss of cell viability as depicted in Figure 15.9\n. CNTs also exhibit primary genotoxicity due to the direct interaction of particles with cells, or secondary genotoxicity due to the generation of an excess of ROS. MWCNTs have genotoxicity effects due to DNA damage through ROS, leading to increased mutation frequencies (Sargent et al., 2010).",

France is in the process of publishing a series of technical guidance documents related to nanotechnologies including CNTs as FR1, FR2, and FR3. Similarly, the UK Government has committed toward EHS research, primarily with new studies on safety issues of specific nanomaterials, in particular nanosilver and CNTs with the Unites States as UK2, UK3, UK4, and OECD1. Of late, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of United States has issued certain regulations for CNTs and other nanomaterials.
