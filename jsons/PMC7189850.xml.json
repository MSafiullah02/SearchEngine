            "text": "A variety of display technologies, such as Phage or mRNA display, are used for selection of the new binders against wide range of antigens [[1], [2], [3]]. In Phage display, a DNA library encoding millions of variants of a specific antibody is cloned in fusion to a phage coat protein such that each phage expresses a slightly different specific binder on its surface. The DNA encoding each binder is then contained within each phage, allowing a direct linkage between the DNA sequence and functionality of the binding protein to the target antigen. The selection relies on an affinity enrichment process known as Biopanning [3,4]. The Biopanning process includes three parts: binding of phage to the target antigen, washing out the non-binding phages, and then elution of binding phage. The target antigens used for Biopanning are typically highly purified recombinant proteins that are immobilized on either beads or solid supports such as ELISA multi-well plates. Solid-support immobilization methods require less target protein and facilitate the selection multiple targets simultaneously. However, in both methods, the quality and yield of the recombinant protein have an essential role in the generation of antibodies [5]. For every new Biopanning selection process \u223c1 mg of purified recombinant protein is required (typically 1\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml for each well of a microtiter plate). In many laboratory applications, the purification of new target antigen proteins can present a serious bottleneck to developing new binders, since each new target can require an entirely new expression and purification method to be developed.",

            "text": "To circumvent purification steps, several methods have been established. Lim et al. have developed a methods denoted as Yin-Yang panning [6]. This method was developed for affinity selection of a specific protein in crude lysate without purification. This procedure was done by saturation of non-binder antibodies in non-expressed bacterial lysate, with blocking agents in ELISA wells, followed by selection of specific binders from expressed lysates in wells. This method was used for development of MERS-CoV nucleoprotein specific antibody. Although this method is very cost effective, it must be optimized for every target protein. Fierle et al. have used bacterial superglue for specific capture of antigen from crude lysate [7]. This method is based on covalent peptide-protein interaction of SpyTag (SpyT) and SpyCatcher (SpyC) from Streptococcus pyogenes [8]. In practice, the SpyTag is chemically synthesized and conjugated onto beads, while the corresponding SpyCatcher protein is expressed as a fusion partner with several cancer antigens expressed in a recombinant eukaryotic host system. The SpyCatcher fusion protein was specifically captured onto the bead-based solid phase and then used specific-antibody selection. This interaction is efficient and highly specific. However, it is relatively expensive due to chemical synthesis and conjugation of SpyTag.",

It reversibly aggregates and becomes insoluble in the presence of low concentrations of calcium (25 mM) and remains insoluble until the calcium is removed by EDTA or other strong chelating agent. At this calcium concentration most bacterial proteins remain soluble, making it possible to isolate RTX-fusion proteins from whole lysates by simple centrifugation. By washing the RTX fusion pellet several times, it is possible to achieve pure a protein. Addition of metal chelators such as EDTA/EGTA in equivalent concentration reverts the RTX tag to soluble form. The RTX-based purification is illustrated in Fig. 1\n. Addition of a solubility enhancer (in this work Trx) enhanced the production yield. For pET32-RTX-SpyC002, \u223c6.5 mg of pure protein was purified from 200 ml of shake-flask culture, where the pellet was washed 5 times. It was noted that after the third round of washing the purity of the protein didn't change, indicating that 3 wash cycles are suitable for protein purification (Fig. 2\nA).

            "text": "Spy peptide-protein interaction depends on two factors; SpyT:SpyC ratio and their concentrations in the reaction. In general, a 1.5 to 3-fold excess ratio is recommended for one partner, with a 2h reaction time and 10 \u03bcM concentration of the limiting protein at room temperature. This time can be increased to 16h for crowded surfaces [13]. To achieve the maximum reaction in short time, the ratio and temperature were increased to a 3.5-fold molar excess and 30 \u00b0C respectively. Although higher temperature such as 37 \u00b0C accelerates the reaction, it may not suitable for some proteins due to stability concerns. The remaining factor was binding partner concentration. The Coated SpyC proteins were divided into two groups. In one group the concentration of the SpyC was constant at 100 \u03bcg/ml (1.5 \u03bcM). In another group, The SpyC was \u00bd serially diluted from 100 \u03bcg/ml (1.5 \u03bcM) to 0.78 \u03bcg/ml (\u223c10 nM) and then coated onto ELISA wells to determine threshold of reaction at low concentration [14]. For coating, PBS buffer was used with simple dilution, without need of protein dialysis. Due to the sensitivity of the RTX to calcium, skimmed milk was not used as blocking agent. As the Spy peptide-protein interaction occurs in a pH range from 4 to 8 [13], SpyT fusion proteins were diluted in PBS-T buffer and \u00bd serially diluted from 500 to 3.9 \u03bcg/ml.",

            "text": "To assess the maximum possible signal at different concentrations of reacted SpyT002- GFP fusion protein to the coated SpyC, the purified Trx-RTX-GFP test protein was \u00bd serially diluted from 100 to 0.78 \u03bcg/ml (from A-H) and was used as positive control. The signal of the positive control was approximately 3 (OD 450 nm) in all concentrations. At a constant concentration of SpyC (100 \u03bcg/ml), the signal of SpyT at concentrations ranging from 500 to 15 \u03bcg/ml was similar to the positive control. The signal decreased significantly at 7.8 \u03bcg/ml (86 nM) and 3.9 \u03bcg/ml (43 nM) of SpyT concentration. The SpyT lysate signal was somewhat lower due to impurity, but followed pure protein pattern (Fig. 4\nA). In serially diluted SpyC, the signal was maximum at 200 nM concentration of SpyC (Fig. 4B). At lower concentrations the signal decreased to about 40% of positive control at 12 nM. According to the result of the SpyT purified and lysate samples, for 100 \u03bcg/ml concentration of SpyC, the minimum concentration of SpyT that is required for a high reaction rate in 2h at 30 \u00b0C is \u223c173 nM of SpyT protein (in this work \u223c15 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig. 4C). However, it is possible to use lower concentrations, but with a slower reaction rate. Serial dilution of SpyC results showed that the minimum concentration of SpyC required for a high reaction rate is between 100 and 200 nM (\u223c6.25\u201312.5 \u03bcg/ml) and in this case at least \u223c350\u2013700 nM of SpyT (in this work \u223c31\u201362.5 \u03bcg/ml) is required (Fig. 4D). These results match the original Spy002 article, which reports that the reaction rate in 100 nm SpyC is \u223c70% [9].",

Since the development of this method in 2012, its applications are expanding along with its potential [22]. In this work we have combined a non-chromatographic method with the spy catcher002 protein to generate a potentially cost-effective universal capture method for immobilization of SpyT-fusion recombinant proteins from unpurified feeds. The RTX-mediated protein purification takes 1\u20132 h, without any specific equipment. As mentioned above, we produced \u223c6 mg of purified fusion protein in one example, which is theoretically suitable for the generation of hundreds of ELISA wells. Conversely, the sample size is also small, which subsequently decreases the required culture volume. In addition, this system is sensitive to small amounts of recombinant protein, which is ideal for low-expressing recombinant proteins or in mammalian transient expression systems. However, low concentrations of recombinant protein (100 nM for both partners) may show different results due to reaction rate dependence of Spy variant 002 on protein concentration. Recently, variant 003 of this method has been developed[23]. Increased sensitivity of this method to even sub-nanomolar concentrations may be possible by applying Spy003. As both ELISA and Spy tag-protein are compatible with urea, it is possible to use this method with urea to dissolve inclusion bodies and continue process steps with immobilized protein. This method is also helpful for the study of SpyT fusion vaccines and for studies of immunization or in labon chip methods.",
