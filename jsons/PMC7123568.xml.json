Phylogenetic classification of streptococci is based on 16S rRNA sequences [1], and it forms the backbone of the overall classification system of streptococci. Phenotypic properties are also important, especially for clinical microbiologists. The type of hemolysis on blood agar, reaction with Lancefield grouping antisera, resistance to optochin, and bile solubility remain important for grouping of clinical Streptococcus isolates and therefore treatment options [2]. In the following chapter, two phenotypic classification groups, viridans group streptococci (VGS) and beta-hemolytic streptococci, will be discussed.",

High-level beta-lactam resistance in VGS is a real threat to the treatment of infective endocarditis and empirical treatment of sepsis in neutropenic patients.

            "text": "Viridans group streptococci form a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of species belonging to the genus Streptococcus [1]. However, they have some common phenotypic properties. VGS are a group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci with a chaining morphology upon microscopic examination. They can be grouped as alpha- or nonhemolytic. They can be differentiated from S. pneumoniae by their resistance to optochin and lack of bile solubility, though the distinction between the two groups remains difficult due to similar sequence homology [2, 4]. They are leucine aminopeptidase positive, pyrrolidonylaryl amidase negative, and can be differentiated from Enterococcus species by their inability to grow in medium containing 6.5 % sodium chloride [2]. Nutritionally variant streptococci were once included in VGS but based on molecular data been removed to a new genus Abiotrophia [5]. VGS belong to the normal microbiota of the oral cavities and upper respiratory tracts of humans and animals. They can also be isolated from the female genital tract and all regions of the gastrointestinal tract [2, 5]. Although historically VGS are poorly classified, there are many species within the group. The six major groups include S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and S. bovis group. The S. anginosus group has been the source of much controversy and ambiguity regarding taxonomy and classification. This group of organisms can be alpha-, beta-, or nonhemolytic, and it is the isolates lacking beta-hemolysis that are generally considered to be a part of VGS. Due to the diverse nature of VGS, the rates and patterns of antimicrobial resistance vary greatly. Differences in species identification and patient population contribute to this variability [4].",

The active-site serine reacts with the beta-lactam ring and generates a covalently linked enzyme-beta-lactam intermediate. This acyl enzyme intermediate is not able to catalyze cross-linking of the peptidoglycan subunits [23]. In streptococci there are low and high molecular weight PBPs [25, 26]. Both of these enzymes are important for the cell-wall synthesis, but only the high molecular weight PBPs are important for the bacterial killing activity of the beta-lactam antibiotics [24]. In VGS there are two kinds of high molecular weight PBPs, PBP1 (PBP1a and PBP1b), and PBP2 (PBP2a, PBP2b, PBP2x) [25].

Decreased affinity can be achieved by amino acid substitutions in the transpeptidase domain of the PBPs [24, 27]. A single point mutation can result in an increase in the penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value. Normally more than one mutation is needed for intermediate level beta-lactam resistance. Highly resistant strains have accumulated several mutations in the PBPs, altering the PBPs significantly so the beta-lactams can no longer bind to the PBP. Accumulation of several mutations in the PBPs may also result in lethal mutations if cell-wall integrity is compromised. Based on the data obtained in S. pneumoniae, these highly resistant strains may also have mutations beyond those found in PBPs [24]. Streptococci have overcome this problem by horizontal transfer of functional mutated PBP coding genes or gene fragments. Transformation and subsequent homologous recombination has produced beta-lactam-resistant VGS with mosaic PBP genes. In these mosaic PBP genes, there are gene regions obtained from resistant strains dispersed through the wild-type PBP genes [28].",

Erythromycin resistance is quite common among clinical VGS isolates. In Europe, the MIC50 and MIC90 for erythromycin for VGS is \u22640.25 mg/L and >2 mg/L. Resistance levels continue to remain high with 36.2 % of isolates resistant to erythromycin [29] (Table 50.1). In the United States, macrolide MIC values and resistance rates continue to rise. Approximately 50 % of VGS isolates in the LEADER study were resistant to erythromycin with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.5 mg/L and 16 mg/L, respectively [30]. The most common erythromycin resistance mechanism is mediated by mef(A) genes azithromycin [36, 37]. Roughly 70\u201380 % of the erythromycin-resistant VGS strains are carrying mef(A) gene and about 16\u201320 % are carrying erm(B) gene [36\u201338]. However, the situation may vary. There is one report from France, where erm(B) was reported to be much more common than mef(A) among blood isolates of VGS [35]. The continuous surveillance of invasive VGS isolates is warranted and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases [39].",

Resistance levels are similar among both blood and the normal microbiota isolates. The reason for lower resistance levels is that the efflux mechanism mediated by mef(A) resistance gene does not confer resistance to clindamycin [40]. An autopsy report of a patient with a S. mitis strain found that the pattern of resistance in this isolate resembled an induced macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance (MLSB) phenotype as a result of short-term use of clindamycin. This mechanism induces resistance to both clindamycin and minocycline [41].",

In some studies, resistant strains have not been isolated, whereas other studies show reduced susceptibility in as much as 70 % of strains and resistance in 28 % [44, 45]. VGS strains with quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC values of 16 mg/L have also been described [44]. Resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin is linked to the streptogramin A (dalfopristin) resistance. Therefore in order to be resistant to the antibiotic combination, a strain must be resistant to streptogramin A. Streptogramin A resistance is mediated by vga(A), vga(B), lsa, and various vat genes. Thus far, these genes have been found in clinical Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains, but the presence of the genes in VGS has not been reported [46]. Although not studied in detail [44, 47], it is possible that the resistance is mediated by ribosomal mutation as in S. aureus [48].",

Topoisomerase IV is the primary target for fluoroquinolones in VGS [50]. Mutations at the topoisomerase IV genes confer low-level resistance (MIC 4 mg/L).

The inducible and constitutive forms of MLSb resistance have been found in beta-hemolytic streptococci since the early 1970s [98\u2013100]. The erm(B) methylase gene was the only erm gene class found in streptococci [101\u2013103] until 1998, when the sequence of erm(TR) in S. pyogenes was published [104]. Its nucleotide sequence is 82.5 % identical to staphylococcal erm(A) and 58 % identical to erm(B) and, therefore, erm(TR) belongs to erm(A) methylase gene class [105]. The inducible or constitutive production of the methylase is dependent on the sequence of the regulatory region situated upstream from the structural methylase gene. Resistance is associated to structural changes in the regulatory sequence. Exposing S. pyogenes harboring the inducible erm gene to clindamycin results in highly resistant mutants of S. pyogenes [106].",

Thirty-four percent of the studied isolates represented the new M-phenotype [80]. Subsequently, the active efflux mechanism causing this phenotype and the encoding mef(A) and mef(E) (macrolide efflux) genes were characterized in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae [33, 107]. Isolates with this mechanism have been found among beta-hemolytic streptococci in different parts of the world. Countries where strains of GAS carrying mef(A) have been observed now account for the majority of macrolide-resistant isolates. These countries include Spain [108, 109], Germany [110], Greece [111], Finland [112], Taiwan [113], the United States [114], Chile [115], and Argentina [116].

            "text": "Resistance gene erm(B) has been shown to be either plasmid or chromosome associated in streptococci [105]. In earlier studies conjugative plasmids with erythromycin resistance determinants were found from group A, B, C, and G streptococci and were shown to transfer by conjugation between streptococcal species [130]. Transfer was also seen by transduction among VGS [131, 132]. However, most antibiotic resistance genes in streptococci are currently thought to be chromosomal in origin. Beta-hemolytic streptococci belonging to groups A, B, C, and G have been shown to transfer their chromosomal macrolide resistance determinants by conjugation [126, 133\u2013135]. A composite chromosomal conjugative element, Tn3701, encoding resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline has been described in GAS [136]. Within this element the resistance genes are carried by a Tn916-like transposon. The presence of Tn916-Tn1545-like conjugative transposons carrying erm(B) and tet(M) has been verified, and an association of chromosomal erm(A) with tet(O) has been noted among GAS [137, 138]. An unusual chimeric genetic element containing DNA identical to Tn1207.1, a transposable element carrying mef(A) in macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, has also been found in different GAS strains. The mechanism of horizontal transfer in these strains was suggested to be transduction [139]. Furthermore, analysis of the genetic environments of the mef(A) and erm(B) genes by Southern blot experiments have indicated a remarkable heterogeneity of genetic elements carrying these genes, particularly erm(B). This suggests that different mobile elements can be recruited into the chromosomes of the circulating GAS population and that genetic rearrangement may also occur after a strain has acquired the resistance determinant [138]. Macrolide resistance mechanisms differ among streptococcal Lancefield groups and geographical area. New gene sequences demonstrating resistance continue to evolve.",

            "text": "A large variety of clones of GAS are drug resistant [113, 138, 140, 141]. Increased resistance rates may be caused by clonal spread of resistant strains and by horizontal transfer of resistance determinants among the circulating microbial population. Macrolide-resistant GAS of the same clone have been found from different countries and even different continents [140]. Same clones have been found among susceptible isolates as well, but in general the heterogeneity of GAS clones seems to be lower among resistant than susceptible isolates [138, 140, 141]. Single clones of GAS with a macrolide-resistant determinant may become predominant or cause outbreaks both regionally and nationwide [128, 142\u2013144]. For example, in 1994, 82 % of erythromycin-resistant GAS isolates collected in Finland expressed the M-phenotype. Although multiple clones were found among these isolates, increased regional resistance rates were clearly associated to T4M4 serotype with mef(A) [112, 134]. In the United States, isolates carrying mef(A) of an emm6 (M6 serotype) clone caused an epidemic among schoolchildren in 2001. In April\u2013May of 2002, this serotype was not found in the same region when the resistance rate was high. Thirty-five percent of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, with an emm75 (M75 serotype) clone predominating [114, 143]. Cresti et al. found that a steady increase of erythromycin-resistant GAS from 9 % in 1992 to 53 % in 1997 in an area in central Italy was caused by an increase of the proportion of strains carrying inducible and constitutive erm(B) and erm(TR) determinants. These strains were of multiclonal origin. Correlation of the erythromycin-resistant GAS clones to the heterogeneity of genetic elements carrying the erm(B) indicated identical genetic environments of erm(B) in clonally unrelated strains, but on the other hand also considerable diversity of these genetic elements both among clonally unrelated and within clonally identical strains [138]. The increase of resistance includes a complex genetic interaction within circulating streptococcal population and may be between streptococci and other species [145]. Macrolide consumption, differing immunities, and other host factors of populations may also contribute to this interplay and spread of resistance determinants and resistant clones [146\u2013148].",

Although less virulent than other microorganisms, VGS continues to be the predominant cause of community-acquired IE. VGS and Streptococcus bovis account for 40\u201360 % of native-valve endocarditis in the community.

There have been changes in the etiology of bacteremia in febrile neutropenic patients, and infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among this population. Gram-negative pathogens was historically the primary cause; however, up to 70 % of bacteremia cases in neutropenic patients are now associated with Gram-positive bacteria [170\u2013173]. Bacteremia is identified in 10\u201327 % of febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies, and 18\u201329 % of the bacteremia is caused by viridans streptococci. Possible reasons for this shift are use of prophylactic antibiotics, increased use of intravenous catheters, and aggressive chemotherapies resulting in prolonged neutropenia and mucositis [171, 172, 174, 175]. VGS are an important cause of bacteremia among neutropenic patients. One study assessed 528 episodes of bloodstream infections, 15 % of which were associated with neutropenia. Thirty-five percent of the blood stream infections were caused by Gram-positive pathogens, with VGS being the most frequent causative pathogen at 22 % [176]. The proportion of VGS as a cause of bacteremia ranges between 3 % and 30 % [56, 172, 173, 177\u2013179]. S. mitis followed by S. oralis or S. sanguis are the most commonly isolated species [173, 179\u2013182]. Bacteremia caused by VGS strains often originate from the oral mucosa [183, 184]. Predisposing factors for VGS infections are severe and prolonged neutropenia, prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, mucositis, and treatment of chemotherapy-induced gastritis with antacids or histamine type 2 antagonists [174, 182]. VGS infections can be rather asymptomatic, fever being the most common symptom [174, 181, 185\u2013187]. Eighteen to 39 % of the patients with VGS infections develop serious complications, including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or both.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2019s (IDSA) most recent update in recommendations in treatment of patients with fever and neutropenia discuss risk assessment. Once fever is detected, risk and severity infection should be assessed in order to help guide type, venue, and duration of empirical treatment. Updated European guidelines review the importance of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenia to minimize the collateral damage associated with antibiotic overuse and the further selection of drug-resistant pathogens. The guidelines suggest that infection control procedures and new antibiotic regimens based on local epidemiology, risk factors, escalation and de-escalation approaches, duration of empiric therapy, nonconventional therapies against MDR, and other bacterial management issues are vital to optimize antibiotic choice. For the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on IDSA-based recommendations.",

For these patients, hospitalization and intravenous empirical treatment may be necessary. Preferred agents include an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, carbapenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam, although initiation of monotherapy with an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent, such as cefepime, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or piperacillin-tazobactam, may be used. Ceftazidime monotherapy has also been shown to be effective and continues to be used at some cancer centers. However, many experts avoid ceftazidime monotherapy because of rising resistance rates among Gram-negative bacteria and its limited activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococci, compared with newer alternatives [169]. Glycopeptides should be avoided first-line because of limited Gram-negative coverage, and empirical addition of vancomycin did not give extra benefit when compared to piperacillin-tazobactam therapy [190]. Regardless, the addition of this agent could benefit those with suspected catheter-related infection, skin or soft tissue infection, pneumonia, or hemodynamic instability [169].",

Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis should be considered for high-risk patients [191]. In multiple institutions, the use of quinolone prophylaxis in high-risk neutropenic patients is considered standard of care but the rapid development of resistance on therapy is a concern. Garnica et al. analyzed outcomes associated with quinolone prophylaxis and observed fewer episodes of febrile neutropenia and bacteremia, shorter duration of antibiotic therapy and hospitalization, as well as increased use of carbapenems and higher rates of quinolone resistance [192]. Although IDSA, among other treatment guidelines, recommend beta-lactam therapy as drug of choice, it is uncertain whether these practice guidelines can be applied to both adults and children due to potential differences in complication frequencies and antibiotic susceptibilities.",

Among the 202 episodes of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in adults and children, there were 20.8 % of cases with severe complications including 6.9 % identified deaths. Approximately 13 % of these episodes were attributable to bacteremia caused by VGS. Susceptibility testing results demonstrated that 80 % of the 199 isolates were susceptible to cefepime, and there was no association with patient age and pathogen susceptibility. This data suggests that it may not be necessary to adjust treatment guidelines between adults and children. In pediatric cancer patients, VGS strains are predominantly S. mitis and S. oralis. S. mitis is the most frequent VGS species causing bacteremia and is also most likely to be penicillin resistant [188].",

Studies have shown penicillin resistance is greater than 50 % and imipenem resistance is up to 25 % of Streptococcus from bone marrow transplant recipients [171]. As a result, some institutions may include vancomycin in the initial empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia. Studies have shown increased mortality in patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia when vancomycin was not included in the initial empiric regimen [173]. More recently, Shelburne et al. developed a clinical prediction model for beta-lactam resistance in VGS causing bloodstream infection. The study validates use of Gram-positive spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, for empiric therapy of febrile neutropenia. Several assumptions were made including the definition of penicillin non-susceptibility, an MIC value \u22652 mg/L, increased risk of shock syndrome, and mortality. It was also assumed that vancomycin administered at onset of fever in neutropenic patients with VGS bacteremia will improve outcomes. Beta-lactam use in the prior 30 days, beta-lactam prophylaxis, and inpatient status at onset of febrile neutropenia correlated with a predicted MIC value \u22652 mg/L and non-susceptibility. It was determined in this one study that glycopeptides can be safely deferred until documentation of a resistant Gram-positive bacterial infection is made, despite IDSA guidelines stricter criteria [193].",

Secretions become thick and plug passageways in the lungs and sinuses. Bacteria can adhere to this thick mucus and result in sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Although CF has no cure, antibiotics are a staple in the treatment and prevention of lung infections. Evidence suggests S. anginosus, among other VGS organisms, may be important pathogens in this population. Recent studies have compared resistance patterns in CF and non-CF patient populations and have shown that both penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant VGS isolates in fibrotic patients have reached 38.4 % and 87.9 %, respectively. Among CF isolates, resistance rates are increasing as patients are living longer and continuously face antibiotic exposure. Moreover, as the physiology of the lung is affected in these patients, so is drug penetration into their lungs. This may result in suboptimal drug concentrations at the site of infection, leading to increased selection of resistance [194].",

[196\u2013198]. The use of a macrolides for the treatment of macrolide-resistant GAS pharyngitis is also associated with a significantly lower clinical cure rate compared to that achieved with amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or cefaclor [198]. Again, emphasizing the importance of culture and susceptibility results in treatment selection. A recent study has also shown erm and emm 90 to be important resistance genes in invasive GAS [199]. Few resistant strains exist and the knowledge of resistance and resistance mechanisms is important. For example, use of clindamycin against an erythromycin-resistant isolate requires knowledge of the result of both the susceptibility testing and the determination of the macrolide resistance phenotype for a given isolate, because clindamycin should not be used to treat isolates with the MLSb-phenotype [106].",

Per guidelines, all pregnant women in the United States are screened and are prophylactically treated. For those at risk, intrapartum penicillin therapy is recommended, with ampicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and vancomycin as acceptable alternative treatments, with penicillin G being the drug of choice [205]. Previously considered a genitourinary pathogen, it has emerged as a non-nosocomial opportunistic pathogen causing serious clinical complications including bloodstream infection, endocarditis, and CNS infections. Sunkara et al. evaluated the epidemiology of GBS in nonpregnant adults. It was found that GBS is associated with younger age, higher incidence of beta-lactam allergy, and independently linked to immunosuppression. GBS are susceptible to commonly used antimicrobials including penicillins and cephalosporins and therefore are not associated with a delay in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Resistance rates in second-line treatment options, including macrolides and clindamycin, continue to rise and should be closely monitored [206].",

Beta-lactam resistance is primarily mediated by point mutations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and presents clinical challenges due to its role in treatment of infective endocarditis and neutropenic fever. Common macrolide resistance genes include erm and mef. Resistance with this class of antibiotics may be responsible for a variety of infections including pharyngitis and neonatal sepsis. Both resistance genes and mechanisms continue to evolve, and new sequences have been discovered in recent years. Antibiotic overuse, inappropriate antibiotic use, and delayed antibiotic administration are contributing factors to the rise in antibiotic resistance. Clinical studies and drug development continue to provide guidance and new treatment options; however, use of local antibiograms, implementation of infection control procedures, and antimicrobial stewardship are critical in treating patients with invasive streptococcal infections including VGS and beta-hemolytic streptococci.",
