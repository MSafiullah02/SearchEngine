Broadly, tissue regeneration is achieved by proliferation of common differentiated cells and/or by deployment of specialized stem/progenitor cells, which has been applied in some studies [6\u201310]. After lung damage, adult lung tissue has a remarkable capacity for regeneration, owing to a few facultative stem/progenitor cell populations that become activated in response to tissue damage [11, 12]. The distal airway stem/progenitor cells (DASCs) expressing basal cell-restricted transcription factor p63 and keratin-5 (KRT5) have been shown to have potent regenerative capacity after lung injury [13\u201316]. Influenza-induced lung injury activated DASCs to proliferate and migrate widely to occupy heavily injured areas, whereupon they differentiate toward mature epithelium and the regeneration of injured tissue depending on the extent of injury [14]. The feasibility for large-scale in vitro expansion and remarkable lung engraftment after transplantation make DASC an ideal candidate for cell therapy [15, 17].",

The results showed that mDASCs could incorporate, proliferate, and differentiate into type I pneumocytes. In addition, mDASCs could inhibit pulmonary fibrogenesis by attenuating the deposition of collagen and the expression of \u03b1-SMA in lungs. Furthermore, mDASCs improved the pulmonary function and reduced the animal\u2019s mortality in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice. The results indicated that DASCs may be an ideal candidate for the cell therapy of pulmonary fibrosis.",

These stem cells are typically quiescent in normal conditions and proliferate during injury repair [19\u201321]. Endogenous adult lung stem cells are important for epithelial cell homeostasis and injury repair which have attracted significant interest. Numerous studies of human and animal lung have identified subsets of lung epithelial cells that could respond to lung injury with self-renewal and differentiation capacity, including basal cells, club cells, and AECII cells of the alveoli [12, 22, 23]. Moreover, advanced lineage tracing techniques have suggested that most types of lung epithelial cells can proliferate and expand after injury to promote lung repair [24\u201328]. Several studies demonstrated that P63+/KRT5+ mDASCs underwent rapid proliferation and migration to damaged alveolar regions in response to influenza-induced ARDS. These migrated cells assembled and expressed typical alveoli-associated markers which suggested that mDASCs played a role as an intermediate in the reconstitution of the alveolar-capillary network eradicated by viral infection [13\u201315].",

Our findings showed that bleomycin induced a significant acute lung injury in 7 days and then caused obvious fibrosis in day 21. Therefore, these findings were consistent with the previous studies.

However, Zuo et al. reported that mDASCs expressed type I and type II pneumocyte markers 40 days after virus infection [15], and Vaughan et al. also found that ~ 1/3 of the Krt5+ cells resolved into type II pneumocytes 50 days after bleomycin injury [14]. The difference of differentiation time of transplanted mDASCs in animals between our experiment and theirs maybe the main cause. Together, these findings demonstrated that the mDASCs could incorporate, proliferate, and differentiate into type I pneumocyte cells which indicated the participation of regeneration and reparation following lung injury.",

We therefore explored the underlying mechanism of the protective effect of mDASCs against pulmonary fibrosis caused by bleomycin. Hydroxyproline is a precursor of collagen, a key amino acid of collagen synthesis in the fibrotic lesions of mice. Compared to the control group, the injury group exhibited an obvious enhancement of hydroxyproline levels in lung tissues over time, consistent with previous studies [34, 35]. However, the treatment with mDASCs significantly decreased the hydroxyproline content in lung tissues. The development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was also related to the accumulation of \u03b1-SMA, which is a marker of myofibroblasts [36]. After bleomycin instillation, acute lung inflammation developed (day 7), and at this stage, we observed no change of \u03b1-SMA expression compared with the control group, but the expression of \u03b1-SMA increased on days 14 and 21, which were significantly alleviated by treatment with mDASCs.",
