We found significant differences in hospital and ICU organization, resource allocation, and use of patient management protocols. The highest nursing/patient ratio was in Oceania (100% 1:1). Dedicated Advanced Practiced Providers are mostly present in North America (73.7%) and are uncommon in Oceania (7.7%) and the Middle East (0%). The presence of dedicated respiratory therapist is common in North America (85%), Middle East (85%), and Latin America (84%) but less common in Europe (26%) and Oceania (7.7%). The presence of dedicated pharmacist is highest in North America (89%) and Oceania (85%) and least common in Latin America (38%).

It is also dedicated to the advancement of such care [2] . The development of neurocritical care evolved from the recognition that primary brain injuries are affected by systemic alterations, e.g., hypoxia or fever and ongoing events in the brain (the so-called secondary injuries), when not recognized and treated promptly. The field has evolved from a primary focus on the post-operative care of neurosurgical patients to the broader resuscitation of patients with severe brain insults, patients with medical conditions that affect the brain, e.g., cardiac arrest and disorders of the spinal cord or peripheral nerves, e.g., ascending polyneuropathy. The individuals that are specially trained to deal with these complex issues are called neurointensivists.",

Such growth was enhanced by the creation of the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) in 2003 with the support of the Society of Critical Care Medicine [5] . The NCS is a multidisciplinary nonprofit organization that currently has over 1000 members from more than 24 countries around the world. In addition, in 2005 the medical subspecialty of neurocritical care achieved a major milestone in the USA when it gained full acceptance by the United Council of Neurological Subspecialties, which is a nonprofit organization committed to the establishment of training standards for neurological subspecialty fellowship programs [6, 7] . Despite these advances, there is limited data on the scope of practice of neurointensivists and epidemiological data on the types of patients and treatments used in neurocritical care units (NCCU) worldwide. For example, there is the perception that neurocritically ill patients in the USA are usually cared for in dedicated NCCUs compared to other regions of the world where those patients are cared for in mixed-type units. To address these issues, we designed a multicenter, international, point-PRevalence, cross-sectional, prospective, observational, non-interventional study In NeuroCritical carE (PRINCE Study). We wanted to determine whether there is geographic variability in the scope of practice of neurointensivists and the delivery of neurocritical care. In this manuscript, we describe data from the first part of the PRINCE Study, which included registration and a description of hospital and overall neurocritical care services organization. We believe that presenting this information is important as this provides the first glimpse into the organization of neurocritical care in various regions of the world and will serve as the starting point for further studies and discussions regarding neurocritical care practice and resource allocation.

During these teleconferences, we reviewed the study protocol and addressed specific instructions for data collection and entry and all concerns raised by the participating sites. We did not monitor data collection and entry. However, we evaluated incongruous data and outlier values and reconciled those with site investigators. Outliers were defined as values that fell outside two standard deviations from the mean. Incongruous data related to those who were entered using the wrong allowed units or measures.",

In addition, because several sites required data use agreements prior to data entry for Part 2 of PRINCE, we needed to comply with their legal requirements. Specifically, most of those documents indicated that sites needed to be contacted at the end of the data-collection period and prior to publication to ensure that no identifiable information was entered. This process took another 12 months. Moreover, The PRINCE PI (JIS) relocated in 2017 and had to renegotiate access to the study database which was housed at the BCM. The latter took 18 more months.",

Participating investigators received education and training related to study aims and data collection before study initiation. Participating institutions were distributed throughout the World except Africa. However, the PRINCE Study also has several limitations. First, participation was voluntary and uncompensated. It is possible that these may have affected the number of participating institutions. Therefore, the information provided may not represent the true worldwide delivery of neurocritical care but rather the care delivered at the participating institutions. Second, the majority of sites comprised of large academic institutions located in major cities. Generalizability of the results is limited since we cannot infer the manner neurocritical care is practiced in other hospital settings. Third, data collection was not monitored. We only monitored and verified incongruous data and outliers. Fourth, the sample size was determined by the number of sites and investigators that volunteered to participate and not by statistical calculations. Therefore, it is possible that the PRINCE Study is underpowered to detect meaningful statistical differences in several of the variables collected. Despite all these limitations, it is worth noting that the results of the PRINCE Study align in several ways with those from earlier work on neurocritical care using administrative datasets [18] , supporting the generalizability of the data presented.",

However, the data collected raise several points that need to be clarified in subsequent prospective observational studies. Participation of a larger number of non-academic institutions located in cities of diverse sizes and from a larger number of countries including Africa will be needed to be able to have a broader view of available models of neurocritical care delivery. More detailed data on daily activities in the ICU where neurocritical care is delivered is needed to be able to ascertain educational needs in this field and adjust them according to local practices and availability of resources. The role of various practitioners working in those ICUs also needs to be delineated along with the types of interactions that take place among those who work in NCCUs. For example, the role of APPs including the type of work they perform and the hours they spend in the NCCU deserves more attention in future observational studies. All these points are of critical importance since most neurocritically ill patients are cared for in mixed-type ICUs rather than dedicated neuro-ICUs. Lastly, healthcare expenditures associated with staffing of ICUs need to be collected to understand how and where to allocate resources.",
