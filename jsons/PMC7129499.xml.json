In the case of infectious diseases in human beings the most obvious examples are when microbes successfully jump species\u2013quite probably critical events in the emergence of HIV and, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). There is no reason to expect that such events will stop happening in the future or that we will be able to predict or prevent them, whatever precautions we decide to take in food preparation and agriculture.",

            "text": "In choosing tuberculosis as one of his two selected infections that have been profoundly affected by the arrival of antibiotics and vaccines, Dixon makes a strange choice. The effect of BCG on tuberculosis incidence is, at best, modest and the disease worldwide goes from strength to strength despite best chemotherapeutic efforts. By contrast, vaccines have had major effects on the incidence of not only diphtheria, but also tetanus, pertussis, polio, haemophilus and meningococcus C meningitis, measles, mumps, and congenital rubella, whereas improving nutrition and living conditions has probably affected these diseases little or not at all\u2013although these are probably the most effective means to combat tuberculosis. The implication that the achievements of immunisation pale into insignificance alongside the impact of improvements in nutrition and sanitation is seriously misleading. Benefits of childhood vaccines can and already have reached areas where efforts to improve living conditions have not.",

Indeed, there are both hypothetical reasons and direct evidence to suggest that increasing antigen exposure through immunisation in childhood might be protective against such cleanliness-associated problems.",
