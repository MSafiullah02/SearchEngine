Generalizing the theory of large fluctuations to random networks with a given degree distribution, we are able to predict the most probable, or optimal, paths to extinction in various configurations, including truncated power laws. We find that paths for heterogeneous networks follow a limiting form in which infection first decreases in low-degree nodes, which triggers a rapid extinction in high-degree nodes, and finishes with a residual low-degree extinction. The usefulness of our approach is further demonstrated through optimal control strategies that leverage the dependence of finite-size fluctuations on network topology. Interestingly, we find that the optimal control is a mix of treating both high-and low-degree nodes based on theoretical predictions, in contrast to methods that ignore dynamical fluctuations.",

Though many factors may contribute, such as environmental changes and social behavior, it has been demonstrated, and rigorously proven for finite populations, that internal fluctuations in a system's dynamics can organize in such a way to induce a large fluctuation along a most probable, or optimal, path to extinction [3] [4] [5] . Such fluctuations to infection-free states have been studied extensively in well-mixed systems, including the role of vaccination and treatment programs in reducing the average time to extinction [3, 6] . Similarly, the most probable extinction paths have been found in networks with homogeneous degree, but the behavior appears to be independent of network topology, as in the well-mixed limit [7] .",

Novel in this work is that we show the path has two primary forms, close to and far from the epidemic threshold. In the latter, we demonstrate an interesting multistep structure in which low-degree node infections decrease first, followed by a quick, nearly complete extinction in high-degree nodes, and finishing with a low-degree extinction. The approach is then used to design a novel targeted optimal treatment strategy that can exponentially reduce extinction times, but does not trivially treat the most well connected nodes, minimize the epidemic size, or maximize the number of treatments. Instead, the optimal control minimizes the \"action\" associated with a transition to extinction with respect to the network topology. Such controls that manipulate finite-size fluctuations inherent in contact processes based on topology are also novel in the study of complex networks [6, 15] .",

In this representation a network's SIS dynamics is captured by the states and transitions of its nodes; e.g., node i is either infected, denoted \u03bd i \u00bc 1, or susceptible, \u03bd i \u00bc 0, and changes its state \u03bd i \u22360 \u2192 1 with probability per unit time \u03b2\u00f01 \u2212 \u03bd i \u00de P j A ij \u03bd j , and \u03bd i \u22361 \u2192 0 with probability per unit time \u03b1\u03bd i , where \u03b2 and \u03b1 are known as the infection and recovery rates, respectively.",

The network action (4) is thus central to understanding the dependencies of extinction times on network topology. Qualitatively, we find two important parameter regions to consider. First, close to the epidemic threshold when R 0 \u2212 1 \u2273 0 (which we call \"weak\"), the paths to extinction are approximately linear from \u00f0y \u00c3 k ; 0\u00de to \u00f00; p \u00c3 k \u00de. The explicit form can be seen by expanding the equilibria in powers of R 0 \u2212 1, which gives to first order y \u00c3 k \u2248 khk 2 i\u00f0R 0 \u2212 1\u00de=hk 3 i \u00bc \u2212p \u00c3 k , implying that the endemic state and momentum at extinction are simply proportional to degree when the infection is weak. This is intuitive since in the weak limit high-degree nodes drive the epidemic, when only their local reproductive numbers are sufficient to spread infection, (\u03b2k > 1), and therefore must recover disproportionately without reinfection in order for extinction to occur. Paths near the weak limit can be seen in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) where R 0 \u00bc 1.6 and R 0 \u00bc 2.0, respectively, and in Fig. 2 ",

Since the action depends nontrivially on network topology, e.g., Eq. (5), we suggest exploiting topology as a basis for optimal epidemic control strategies in finite networks, with the goal of minimizing extinction times [6, 15, 25] . We illustrate the approach with a random treatment procedure for infected nodes with degree k, such that they recover with an increased rate \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3w k , where \u03b3 is the overall treatment rate, and w k is a targeting fraction of the infected population with degree k: P k w k \u00bc 1. In the weak limit we expect optimal treatment to favor large k (similar to targeted immunization), since y \u00c3 k and p \u00c3 k are proportional to k [26] . However, in the strong limit, treating low-degree nodes close to hki will tend to decrease S, since their numbers must be lowered in the first step, before momenta differ significantly from zero. In intermediate cases, we expect a mixed strategy to minimize S. Treatment results are shown in Fig. 3 for a simple bimodal network with two degree classes for clarity, as a function of the targeting fraction for high-degree nodes, w 50 . Interestingly, we find that choosing the optimal w k for the bimodal network can result in a nearly 50% decrease in the network action, implying an enormous reduction in extinction times, i.e., hTi \u2192 hTi 1=2 (inset of Fig. 3) . Furthermore, we note that in Fig. 3 the size of the endemic state is minimized when w 50 \u00bc 0 (circles), the equilibrium treatment rate \u03b3 P k w k g k y \u00c3 k , is maximized when w 50 \u00bc 0 (circles), and R 0 is minimized when w 50 \u00bc 1 (triangles), but none corresponds to the minimum extinction time control (squares) [27] . The example demonstrates that designing optimal controls intended to drive epidemics to extinction in finite networks cannot be found from the intuitive results of the deterministic limit alone, p k \u00bc 0, but by targeting the network's components in such a way as to minimize the network's action.",
