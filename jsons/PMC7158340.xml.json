            "text": "The location for the first-order neuron is within the vestibular ganglion of cranial nerve VIII or the vestibulocochlear nerve. The axon projects to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei. These neurons receive input from the vestibular receptors contained within the membranous labyrinth that is surrounded by a bony labyrinth located in the petrous temporal bone. The membranous labyrinth consists of four fluid-filled, communicating compartments; these include the saccule and utriculus, three semicircular ducts, and a cochlear duct (Figure 56-2\n).1, 2, 3, 4 Specifically, the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve innervates five sites: the crista of the ampulla of each of the three semicircular ducts and the maculae of the utricle and saccule. Each semicircular duct is orientated at right angles to the others and connects at both ends with the utriculus, which in turn communicates with the saccule. Movement of endolymph contained within the membranous labyrinth is responsible for stimulation of the receptors; the endolymph is thought to be derived from blood.5\n",

A head tilt may be present with either central or peripheral vestibular disease. The head tilt is always toward the side of the lesion with peripheral disease but may be to either side with central disease. A head tilt that is opposite to the side of the lesion is paradoxical. This can be seen with lesions of the flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum or the supramedullary part of the caudal cerebellar peduncle, with sparing of the vestibular nuclei in the rostral medulla. The head tilt often is accompanied by ipsilateral cerebellar signs, paresis, and postural reaction deficits.1, 3, 4, 10 The mechanism by which the paradox of vestibular signs is contralateral to the lesion is not well understood. A loss of cerebellar inhibition over intact vestibular nuclei could result in hyperactivity of the latter, which simulates a relative loss of function on the other side.1\n",

Physiological nystagmus allows the animal to maintain visual fixation on a stationary point and is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (Figure 56-8\n).8 The fast phase is toward the direction of the head movement and represents the corrective repositioning of the eye as the extraocular muscles reach their stretch threshold after the slow phase.8 Delayed physiological nystagmus can be seen with peripheral or central vestibular disease.",

The direction also can depend on whether the lesion is irritative or destructive to the vestibular system.1 With acute onset nystagmus, the eyelids may be seen to contract at a rate corresponding to that of the nystagmus.

Because of the level of patient \u201ccooperation\u201d with cats, sedation or a light plane of general anesthesia often is needed for this test to be performed and interpreted properly. Small (27-gauge) needle electrodes are placed subcutaneously in the scalp and connected to sensitive amplifiers that can record signals in the microvolt range.30 The electrodes are arranged with the positive electrode over the bregma on the dorsum of the skull, the negative electrode just rostral to the base of the pinna of the ear to be tested, and the reference electrode in the same position relative to the untested ear (Figure 56-14\n). The brain activity, resulting from broad-spectrum sounds, such as clicks delivered at 10 to 20 Hz through earphones inserted into the external ear canal, usually is averaged for 10 milliseconds (ms) for the early latency or brainstem potentials Averaging for 50 ms includes a record of middle latency responses, but these are not as well documented in cats.31 The BAEP recording consists of six to seven positive time-locked peaks (I through VII) beginning at approximately 1 ms after the stimulation (Figure 56-15\n). Wave I represents acoustic nerve activity, and subsequent waves mark peak activities as sound is being processed through ascending portions of the auditory pathway (Figure 56-16\n). Mean latencies for peaks I, II, V, and VI in normal adult cats under sedation are 1.02 (\u00b10.04), 1.84 (\u00b10.04), 3.53 (\u00b10.04), and 4.31 (\u00b10.12) ms, respectively.30 A lesion along the auditory pathway can cause an increase in the interpeak latencies (see Figure 56-15).",

The same interpretive principles used for the radiographic diagnosis of peripheral vestibular diseases apply to CT. Findings are more apparent on transverse CT images, however, because of reduced superimposition of structures in comparison to radiographs. CT can allow for an earlier diagnosis of subtle lesions. On a well-positioned study, both bullae should appear symmetrical, although subtle variations occur. Lumina of the tympanic bulla and the external ear canals are gas filled (see Figure 38-16). The tympanic bulla has a thin well-defined wall. Optimal resolution of the inner ear is achieved with high-resolution CT, but it still may be inferior to high-field MRI.",

In addition to an examination of the external ear cavity and the tympanum for masses, the oropharynx should be examined for swelling or deviations of the soft palate.40 Suspicious lesions should be aspirated for cytological analysis. Radiography of the skull can reveal soft tissue opacity in the tympanic bulla, osteolysis, and periosteal reaction (Figure 56-17\n).26, 41 CT is a more accurate method for determining lesion extent. Opacity within the tympanic bullae can indicate fluid or a soft tissue mass effect. Lesion extent within the horizonal and vertical ear canals is identified. Bony lysis involving osseous bulla, petrous temporal bone, and adjacent calvarium may be visualized with aggressive neoplasms.25 Some neoplasms contrast enhance. MRI characteristics described for neoplasms of the middle ear include lysis of the osseous tympanic bulla and petrous temporal bone that can extend to adjacent structures.42 However, a malignant melanoma involving the external ear canal and dorsalateral compartment of the tympanic bulla has been described in the cat, in which destruction of the bulla was not present and contrast enhancement of the mass did not occur.35\n",
