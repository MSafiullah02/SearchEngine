            "text": "As far as we are aware, there are only a small number of case series of patients with viral pneumonia treated with low dose thoracic radiation therapy that have been reported. These studies have methodological flaws and do not convincingly demonstrate efficacy of this treatment approach. In 1943, Oppenheimer reported the outcome of 56 patients with presumed viral pneumonia treated with 0.35 Gy to 0.9 Gy using 130 to 150 kVp X-rays [10]. This case series is notable because patients treated within a few days after the onset of symptoms appeared to respond while patients that presented with symptoms for one week did not improve to the same degree and often a second or third dose of radiation therapy was delivered. Notably, two patients with symptoms that began at least 16 days prior to radiation therapy derived no benefit from the treatment. Oppenheimer concluded that \u201croentgen therapy of virus pneumonia is useful mainly during the early stages of disease.\u201d These findings suggest that even if low dose thoracic radiotherapy has any efficacy in patients with COVID-19, it may not be useful in later stages of the disease once hypoxia or ARDS develop. Moreover, because the case series lacks a sufficient comparison group, it is unclear whether or not radiation therapy impacted the course of viral pneumonia even when administered during the early stages of disease. Indeed, Oppenheimer writes \u201cit certainly cannot be proved that the 56 patients of this series would not have recovered as rapidly without roentgen therapy.\u201d",

These patients presented with fever, sore throat, and chills but never dyspnea. The patients \u201cappeared less ill than the fever would indicate\u201d and had no elevation in respiratory rate \u201cdisproportionate to the fever.\u201d Most of the patients received supportive care alone or were treated with antibiotics. The average duration of illness was approximately 12 days. A subset of 23 patients received 1.12 Gy with 100 kVp X-rays to the involved lobe of the lung, which was repeated 24 hours later in most patients because there was not a satisfactory clinical response. In this subgroup of patients, the average length of illness was 8.4 days. No statistical analysis was performed between the group treated with radiation therapy and the other patients. The authors also did not explain how the 15% of patients who received radiation therapy were selected for this treatment. Therefore, it is possible that the trend to shorter illness in the cohort receiving radiation therapy was a consequence of selection bias. Taken together, these two case series do not provide a strong rationale for testing radiotherapy in a clinical trial of COVID-19 patients with hypoxia and respiratory distress.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, there are only two published reports on utilizing low dose radiotherapy for viral pneumonia in preclinical models [12], [13]. These studies were performed by the same research team at Duke University and published in 1946. One study investigated the impact of low dose 200 kVp X-rays on viral infection in cats, which caused conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and pneumonia [12]. The degree of pneumonia ranged from none, very slight, slight, to moderate and marked. Nine cats were inoculated with the virus and served as controls. Two intervention groups of cats were treated with radiation therapy. Seven cats received radiation therapy starting at 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Five cats received radiation therapy to the thorax (n=4 received 1 Gy, n=1 received 2 Gy divided into two daily doses) and two cats received radiation therapy to the abdomen (n=1 received 1 Gy, n=1 received 2 Gy divided into two daily doses). The second intervention group consisted of six cats, which received radiation therapy to the thorax starting at 48 hours post symptom onset (n=4 received 1 Gy, n=2 received 2 Gy divided into two daily doses). No differences in objective measures, such as temperature or histological changes at necropsy, were observed between any groups. Subjective assessment of the length of illness was reported to be shorter for cats in which the radiation therapy was initiated at 24 hours after symptom onset (5 vs. 10.3 days). However, it is notable that the subjective length of illness in the control group had wide variation (5 to 14 days). The average duration of illness was longer in the animals that received radiation 48 hours after symptom onset (7.5 days) and did not differ significantly from the control group (P=0.13 by Mann-Whitney test). Thus, if radiation therapy has any efficacy in viral pneumonia, it may need to be initiated early. Additionally, it is unclear from the experimental methods whether the animals were randomized to treatment or if the investigator scoring subjective length of illness was blinded to treatment group. Because this study was carried out at the time of several anecdotal reports claiming efficacy of radiation therapy for atypical pneumonia in patients, if the investigator was not blinded to treatment, it is conceivable that these reports may have biased the results of a subjective endpoint.",

In one experiment, 15 of 18 control mice died by day 10 after inoculation. In the experimental group that received 1 Gy total-body-irradiation (TBI) 24 hours after virus inoculation, 12 of 18 mice died by day 10.

            "text": "As there are currently no approved treatments for COVID-19, some have suggested that 0.5 to 1 Gy of whole thorax radiation therapy would present a very low risk to COVID-19 patients in a clinical trial [9]. Although it is conceivable that low dose radiotherapy could ameliorate inflammation to benefit patients with COVID-19, it is likely that low dose radiotherapy will kill B and T cells needed to fight the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which has the potential to increase mortality from COVID-19. When treating cancer, we do not routinely consider the risks of radiation in the dose range of 0.5 to 1 Gy. Indeed, when radiation oncologists review treatment plans, it is unusual to include radiation isodose lines with such low doses. However, the risks for radiation-induced cancer at these low doses can be quantified. We estimated lifetime risks of cancer induction and cancer mortality from radiation exposure using methods reported earlier [14], [15], [16], [17]. Risks for lung, breast and esophageal cancer were evaluated for organ doses of 0.5 and 1 Sv for female and male patients at ages of exposure of 25, 45, and 65 years (Table 1). Model estimates are based on a mixture model of risk transfer between populations, which considers weighted contributions of additive and multiplicative models of tissue specific risks following methods developed by the BEIR VII and UNSCEAR committees [14], [15]. We estimated 95% confidence intervals in risk values by Monte-Carlo propagation of several uncertainties, including statistical and dosimetry uncertainties in epidemiology data and the uncertainty in the risk transfer model [16], [17]. Uncertainties due to possible risk factors related to the presence of pneumonia or viral infection during irradiation were not considered. Our analyses indicate that the risks of cancer due to radiation exposure of the thorax vary by sex, age, and radiation dose (Table 1). The risk of a radiation-induced lung and breast cancer for a 25 year-old woman exposed to 1 Gy of whole thorax radiation may be as high as 5.9% and 5.5%, respectively. For a 25 year-old man, the risk of a radiation-induced esophageal cancer may be as high as 0.32%. Risk declines steeply with age at exposure for breast cancer and more modestly for lung and esophageal cancer.",

Furthermore, delivering radiation therapy to hypoxic COVID-19 patients, who may have ARDS, would increase the risk of infection to staff and cancer patients, who may be at high risk for mortality from COVID-19 [20]. While we appreciate that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing large numbers of deaths and straining health systems worldwide, and that this has motivated colleagues to propose clinical trials of low dose radiotherapy for COVID-19 pneumonia with the best of intentions, we believe that based on the available data, the potential risks of such trials outweigh the potential benefits. Before such trials should be considered, further preclinical work is needed to demonstrate efficacy of radiotherapy to provide scientific justification for a clinical trial in patients with COVID-19.",
