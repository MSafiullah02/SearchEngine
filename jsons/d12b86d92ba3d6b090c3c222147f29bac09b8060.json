Several measures have been taken to prevent the further spread of the virus, including the use of masks, gloves, and disinfectants, and restrictions to avoid traveling to risk areas and having close contact with other people 4 . Moreover, many countries have imposed quarantine and lockdown of schools and all non-essential activities 5 . In this context, particular attention should be paid to patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs or biologics, as they have a higher risk of infection 6 . Other risk factors identified for the development of COVID-19 are the elderly age, the presence of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, some professional categories (e.g. health personnel, policemen, and supermarket clerks) and exposure to infected people 4 . In a recent work published in Lancet 7 , precautions taken by a Wuhan center for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were reported. All biological and immunosuppressive treatments were discontinued, visits in person were replaced by online consultations, and 318 patients were daily recommended to wash their hands frequently, to reduce the time spent outside the home and to use masks outside the home 7 . It is important to underline that a relevant percentage of evaluated patients had risk factors of infection: chronic diseases (15.4%), immunosuppressive agent therapy (11.0%), elderly (10.4%), high-risk professional categories (7.5%), and biological therapy (6.3%) 7 . Recommendations were followed by 90% of subjects and no cases of COVID-19 infection were detected after a period of approximately 2 months 7 . Finally, the authors stressed the importance of daily warnings and recommendations, which favored a wide adherence of patients and contributed to avoid viral contagion 7 .",

In addition, the limited knowledge regarding transmission modalities, clinical symptoms, and natural history of the virus infection has made the management of IBD patients and the adoption of preventive measures even more complex and difficult. Currently, the main source of transmission seems to be mediated by air droplets 8 , although ever-increasing evidence supports the possibility of a fecal-oral infection 9 identify the best way to prevent COVID-19 in IBD patients, to understand whether IBD patients are at increased risk of being infected, and to clarify whether they should be considered as a high-risk population as well as the impact of IBD-related drugs on COVID-19. Another aspect suggested by An et al. 7 is the relevance of the continuous assistance to IBD patients also at home. Home patient management has been called \"telemedicine\" and it is a well-accepted approach by patients, as evidenced by the high adherence to home therapies or recommendations from physicians 22, 23 . Telemedicine has also been associated with a reduction in gastroenterological consultations and hospitalizations and could be a valid alternative to improve the quality of IBD patient care during the COVID-19 outbreak 23 .",

            "text": ". As of March 29, 2020, the World Health Organization has reported 634,835 confirmed cases of infection worldwide and 29,957 deaths 10 . So far, epidemiological data of COVID-19 in IBD patients have not been published and it is unclear whether IBD patients have an increased risk of infection. Interestingly, patients with active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have a greater tissue concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the molecule that allows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to bind the host cell and infect humans11 . Similarly, the level of serine-protease, an essential primer to activate the spike protein, is about 10 times higher in patients with IBD than in healthy subjects, suggesting an increased risk of infection in these patients12 . These data justify concerns for IBD patients and highlight the need to clarify whether there is an association between immunosuppressive / biological therapies and coronavirus infection. Importantly, a 3 times higher risk of serious viral infections (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus) was detected in IBD patients compared to the general population 13 . Although the absolute risk of developing a viral infection was acceptable, the presence of an active disease and treatment with thiopurines were reported as the factors most influencing the infectious risk 13 . Recently the International Organization of IBD (IOIBD) stated that vedolizumab and ustekinumab are safe drugs and do not increase the risk of infection, while the risks of infection related to treatments with thiopurine, anti-TNF agents, and tofacitinib are uncertain 14 . In the work of An et al. 7 all patients discontinued therapy and no patient contracted the infection. This patient management should be discussed. Firstly, some drugs such as thiopurines have a very high clearance time and therefore it would take a long time before reducing the risk of infection 15 . Secondly, therapy discontinuation is associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence/worsening and may lead to an increase of negative outcomes such as hospitalizations and surgeries 16-18 . Thirdly, in this period many countries are lockdown, hospitals are overloaded with work and have changed their organization, minimizing non-essential outpatient activities and focusing on COVID-19 patients 19,20 . All these factors result in greater difficulty in managing IBD recurrences and do not allow to guarantee the best management of patients with active diseases. For these reasons, IBD drug discontinuation should not be recommended in all patients not suspected of COVID-19 14,21 . The therapeutic approach should be personalized and should be based on the balance between the risk of viral infection and the risk of disease recurrence. The ongoing therapies should be stopped only in clearly COVID-19 patients, while in positive SARS-CoV-2 cases (without disease) the decision should be based on the type of drug and the risk of COVID-19 occurrence 14,21 . Large national and international studies are needed to",
