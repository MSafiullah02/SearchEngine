            "text": "\nRespiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common and are associated with significant health burden. For example, pneumonia is the fourth leading cause of death globally and the leading infectious cause [1]. Despite being generally mild and self-limiting, the common cold is associated with an enormous economic burden, both in lost productivity and in expenditures for treatment [2]. The major viral agents of RTIs include influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinoviruses (RVs), enteroviruses (EVs), and human coronavirus (HCoV). Common to these viruses are their ability to infect airway epithelial cells, co-opt host cell proteins to facilitate infection, modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, and to mediate proinflammatory responses which contribute to disease pathogenesis (Table 11.1\n). Yet, some of the unique features of these viruses can lead to diagnostic limitations.",

RSV is the major cause of LRT illness in young children and is associated with an estimated 132,000\u2013172,000 pediatric hospitalizations in the United States annually [19] and globally it is an important cause of death [20]. Most infants (50\u201369%) are infected during the first year of life and virtually all are infected by age 2 [21]. HMPV also causes a broad range of URTI/LRTI, which are clinically indistinguishable from RSV. It accounts for about 1\u20135% of childhood URTI and 10\u201315% of hospitalizations for LRTI, depending on age group and year of study [22], [23], [24]. Primary infection with HMPV tends to occur at a slightly older age than RSV and by age 5 most children have been infected [25], [26].",

Indeed these viruses accounted for 6\u20138% of all hospitalizations for fever or acute respiratory illnesses in children less than 5 years of age [27]. By 5 years of age most children have antibodies against PIV3 and approximately 75% have antibodies against PIV1 and PIV2.",

Although all these viruses replicate in the ciliated columnar cells of the nasopharyngeal (NP) tract [28], [29], [30], it is believed that varying cell receptor usage, including sialic acid containing molecules usage by different PIV strains, likely contributes to the differences in pathogenesis [31], [32]. The viruses may then spread to the LRT within 1\u20133 days as the result of viral impairment of the ciliary epithelium [33]. Paramyxovirus pathogenesis is then associated with necrosis and sloughing of the ciliated epithelial cells which along with edema and increased mucus secretion, obstructs airway, and leads to airway hyperresponsiveness [34], [35].",

Risk factors for bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization include young age, prematurity, male sex for RSV and female sex for HMPV, chronic illness, lower socioeconomic status, smoke exposure, and asthma [21], [37], [38], [39]. PIV develops into LRTI in 15\u201325% of cases [40]. There is a tendency for PIV1 and PIV2 to involve the larynx and upper trachea, resulting in the croup syndrome, while PIV3 spreads to the small air passages with the development of bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis, and/or bronchitis when it is associated with severe disease [27]. There is compelling evidence that the level of virus replication correlates to the disease severity, but innate immune responses also appear to be important [41], [42], [43]. HMPV infection appears somewhat milder than that of RSV, but dual HMPV and RSV infections have been reported as more severe than with either virus alone [44], [45]. Among the two antigenic subgroups, RSV A is associated with more severe disease than subgroup B [46], [47], while the severity of illness associated with HMPV A is similar to HMPV B infection [48].",

Of the URT samples, NP aspirates have traditionally been considered the most sensitive specimen for the detection of respiratory viruses [96], [97]. However, a recent review by Jartti et al. [98] indicates that at least in children all NP samples, aspirates, washes, swabs, or brushings, have statistically equal sensitivity for NAAT, particularly when flocked swabs are used [99]. Historically, virus recovery in adults is much more difficult than in children because virus titers tend to be much lower in adults. The analytical sensitivity of NAAT appears to negate this concern [100]. Similarly, when flocked nasal swabs are used the sensitivity is similar to NP specimens in both pediatric and adult patients [100], [101]. In addition, self-collected (in adult patients) or parent-collected flock nasal swabs specimens also show equivalency, opening the door for point-of-care devices [102], [103], [104].",

However, some NAAT assays are approved for room temperature transport provided it occurs within a few hours. Clinicians should be aware of the approved clinical specimens, as well as specimen storage and transport, for the molecular assay being ordered. Freezing and thawing should be avoided or minimized to avoid degradation of virus particles, exposing the viral RNA to nucleases. Also viral integrity is needed if viral culture is to be performed, for example, for influenza resistance testing.",

This is particularly true for viral pneumonia due to influenza, especially for cases of LRTI due to inhalation rather than spread from the URT. In fact, false-negative NP test occur in 10\u201335% of patients with viral pneumonia [107], [108]. However, LRT specimens are not recommended for routine use as the diagnostic yield will not significantly improve. Furthermore, specificity is not necessarily improved with LRT specimens, particularly with the use of NAAT, as virus can be detected in LRT samples from asymptomatic children [98].

The only exceptions are SARS- and MERS-CoV where stool specimens may provide additional diagnostic yield. Rare occurrences of extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported with some respiratory viruses. Indeed, there have been anecdotal reports of respiratory virus detected in the CNS, myocardium, liver, and other sites [109]. Most often extrapulmonary syndromes are not due to a direct viral effect, but rather due to cytokine release as seen with influenza-associated encephalitis or myocarditis. In such cases, influenza RNA is almost never detected in CSF or myocardium. Likewise, rare cases of HMPV-associated encephalitis have been reported, but viral RNA has not been detected in CSF [53]. In contrast, AdV replicates in multiple organs and tissues. For example, AdV is often detected in urine, CSF, or myocardium in cases of AdV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis, meningitis or encephalitis, and myocarditis [55], [110]. AdV DNA can even be found in serum during respiratory illness [55].",

Often hospitalized patients, particularly those with LRTI, have higher viral titers and shed virus longer [111], [112], [113], [114], [116], [117]. NAATs detect viral targets for a longer duration than other test methods and it is not unusual to detect viral nucleic acid a couple of weeks after infection, albeit the mean duration is generally 6\u201314 days [111], [112], [113], [114], [118], [119].

In tropical climates, infections occur year-round or with increased incidence during the rainy season. The seasonal diversity of respiratory viruses is most evident with epidemiologic patterns of respiratory viruses associated with croup (Fig. 11.3) [123]. Influenza tends to produce a sharp annual peak lasting 6\u20138 weeks, while RSV tends to have a longer duration on the order of 15\u201320 weeks [109]. HMPV typically appears in late winter through early spring with a biennial pattern of epidemics [24]. Classically, PIV1 causes autumn epidemics in odd-numbered years and is sometimes accompanied by PIV2. PIV3 is more endemic with peaks in spring to early summer. Seasonality of PIV4 has not been as well characterized [109]. AdV infections occur throughout the year, but most epidemics occur in the winter or early spring [55]. EV infections usually occur in late summer to early fall, but those associated with respiratory disease also tend to be associated with sporadic outbreaks which can occur year-round. RV infections also occur throughout the year, but distinct peaks of illness are seen in the fall and spring [124]. HCoV are more endemic, but a bit more common in the cooler months [109]. Factors affecting seasonality in temperate climates are most likely due to environmental factors such as low temperatures and humidity, as well as social factors associated with colder months such as crowding indoors [125], [126].",

A negative result can also occur when the patient is no longer shedding detectable virus, or at least at the site of collection. For hospitalized patients with LRT disease, if no other etiology is identified and viral pneumonia is still clinically suspected, the CDC recommends collecting LRT specimens. Sequence deviations or mutations at the site of primer or probe binding are also a potential source of false-negative results. In 2015, the majority of circulating influenza virus in the United States was characterized as A/Switzerland-like H3N2 viruses with significant genetic drift, loss of vaccine protection, and reduced ability to culture in many cell lines. Indeed, matrix gene primer or probe mismatches affect the performance of some commercial NAATs [127]. On the other hand, sequence deviations in the H1 gene affected typing of A(H1N1)pdm09, leading to the serendipitous discovery of a strain of influenza A that cannot be typed. Similarly, pan-detection NAATs may not adequately detect all subtypes within a family of virus as commonly seen with commercial assays for the detection of AdV [128], [129], [130].",

Currently, circulating influenza A (H3N2) and 2009 H1N1 viruses are primarily susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir, but are resistant to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) [133]. However, prior to the 2009 pandemic the seasonal H1N1 virus developed into a predominantly oseltamivir-resistant strain [132]. Luckily this virus was susceptible to the adamantanes. Although only sporadic cases of oseltamivir resistance have been observed in isolates of A(H1N1)pdm09, this virus does have the sample potential as the seasonal H1 strain to become universally resistant.",

Other potentially important mutations include a D199E mutation which is associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir in seasonal H1N1 [135], a D198G (universal numbering, equivalent to site 199) mutation in H5N1 is associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir [136], and a D198N mutation in influenza B virus is associated with high oseltamivir resistance [137].",
