Healthcare systems across developed and developing nations are being put to the ultimate test and are under tremendous pressure to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus and majority of this responsibility is being shouldered by frontline health care workers effortlessly putting their lives on the line in order to do so. Through this article, we attempt to highlight some of the dire challenges currently being faced by frontline health workers and propose certain recommendations to reduce the encumbrance being imposed on them in order to ensure the provision of rapid, well-equipped, efficient health care services.",

Reports from affected countries have revealed in the past that 22% of health care workers were affected in hospitals across Hong Kong, with the initial wave managing to infect 80% of the staff working in the medical wards of Prince Wales Hospital.
