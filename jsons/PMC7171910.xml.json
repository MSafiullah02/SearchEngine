            "text": "The following observations and findings are from the World Trade Center Building Performance Study:48\nThe structural damage sustained by each of the two buildings [WTC 1 and WTC 2] as a result of the terrorist attacks was massive. The fact that the structures were able to sustain this level of damage and remain standing for an extended period of time is remarkable and is the reason that most building occupants were able to evacuate safely. Events of this type, resulting in such substantial damage, are generally not considered in building design, and the ability of these structures to successfully withstand such damage is noteworthy.Preliminary analyses of the damaged structures, together with the fact the structures remained standing for an extended period of time, suggest that, absent other severe loading events such as a windstorm or earthquake, the buildings could have remained standing in their damaged states until subjected to some significant additional load. However, the structures were subjected to a second, simultaneous severe loading event in the form of the fires caused by the aircraft impacts.The large quantity of jet fuel carried by each aircraft ignited upon impact into each building. A significant portion of this fuel was consumed immediately in the ensuing fireballs. The remaining fuel is believed either to have flowed down through the buildings or to have burned off within a few minutes of the aircraft impact. The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses. However, as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the buildings, it ignited much of the buildings\u2019 contents, causing simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings. The heat output from these fires is estimated to have been comparable to the power produced by a large commercial power generating station. Over a period of many minutes, this heat induced additional stresses into the damaged structural frames while simultaneously softening and weakening these frames. This additional loading and the resulting damage were sufficient to induce the collapse of both structures.The ability of the two towers to withstand aircraft impacts without immediate collapse was a direct function of their design and construction characteristics, as was the vulnerability of the two towers to collapse a result of the combined effects of the impacts and ensuing fires. Many buildings with other design and construction characteristics would have been more vulnerable to collapse in these events than the two towers, and few may have been less vulnerable. It was not the purpose of this study to assess the code-conformance of the building design and construction, or to judge the adequacy of these features. However, during the course of this study, the structural and fire protection features of the buildings were examined. The study did not reveal any specific structural features that would be regarded as substandard, and, in fact, many structural and fire protection features of the design and construction were found to be superior to the minimum code requirements.Several building design features have been identified as key to the buildings\u2019 ability to remain standing as long as they did and to allow the evacuation of most building occupants. These included the following:robustness and redundancy of the steel framing systemadequate egress stairways that were well marked and lightedconscientious implementation of emergency exiting training programs for building tenantsSimilarly, several design features have been identified that may have played a role in allowing the buildings to collapse in the manner that they did and in the inability of victims at and above the impact floors to safely exit. These features should not be regarded either as design deficiencies or as features that should be prohibited in future building codes. Rather, these are features that should be subjected to more detailed evaluation, in order to understand their contribution to the performance of these buildings and how they may perform in other buildings. These include the following:the type of steel floor truss system present in these buildings and their structural robustness and redundancy when compared to other structural systemsuse of impact-resistant enclosures around egress pathsresistance of passive fire protection to blasts and impacts in buildings designed to provide resistance to such hazardsgrouping emergency egress stairways in the central building core, as opposed to dispersing them throughout the structure\u2026.WTC 5, WTC 7, 90 West Street, the Bankers Trust building, the Verizon building, and World Financial Center 3 were impacted by large debris from the collapsing towers and suffered structural damage, but arrested collapse to localized areas. The performance of these buildings demonstrates the inherent ability of redundant steel-framed structures to withstand extensive damage from earthquakes, blasts, and other extreme events without progressive collapse.\n",

            "text": "\nIn the study of the WTC towers and the surrounding buildings that were subsequently damaged by falling debris and fire, several issues were found to be critical to the observed building performance in one or more buildings.These issues fall into several broad topics that should be considered for buildings that are being evaluated or designed for extreme events. It may be that some of these issues should be considered for all buildings; however, additional studies are required before general recommendations, if any, can be made for all buildings. The issues identified from this study of damaged buildings in or near the WTC site have been summarized into the following points:a.Structural framing systems need redundancy and/or robustness, so that alternative paths or additional capacity are available for transmitting loads when building damage occurs.b.Fireproofing needs to adhere under impact and fire conditions that deform steel members, so that the coatings remain on the steel and provide the intended protection.c.Connection performance under impact loads and during fire loads needs to be analytically understood and quantified for improved design capabilities and performance as critical components in structural frames.d.Fire protection ratings that include the use of sprinklers in buildings require a reliable and redundant water supply. If the water supply is interrupted, the assumed fire protection is greatly reduced.e.Egress systems currently in use should be evaluated for redundancy and robustness in providing egress when building damage occurs, including the issues of transfer floors, stair spacing and locations, and stairwell enclosure impact resistance.f.Fire protection ratings and safety factors for structural transfer systems should be evaluated for their adequacy relative to the role of transfer systems in building stability.The BPS Team has developed recommendations for specific issues, based on the study of the performance of the WTC towers and surrounding buildings in response to the impact and fire damage that occurred. These recommendations have a broader scope than the important issue of building concepts and design for mitigating damage from terrorist attacks, and also address the level at which resources should be expended for aircraft security, how the fire protection and structural engineering communities should increase their interaction in building design and construction, possible considerations for improved egress in damaged structures, the public understanding of typical building design capacities, issues related to the study process and future activities, and issues for communities to consider when they are developing emergency response plans that include engineering response\u2026.[Regarding one of these aspects,] building evacuation, the following topics were not explicitly examined during this study, but are recognized as important aspects of designing buildings for impact and fire events. Recommendations for further study are to:Perform an analysis of occupant behavior during evacuation of the buildings at WTC to improve the design of fire alarm and egress systems\u2666\nin high-rise buildings.Perform an analysis of the design basis of evacuation systems in high-rise buildings to assess the adequacy of the current design practice, which relies on phased evacuation.Evaluate the use of elevators\u2666\u2666\nas part of the means of egress for mobility-impaired people as well as the general building population for the evacuation of high-rise buildings. In addition, the use of elevators for access by emergency personnel\u2666\u2666\u2666\nneeds to be evaluated\u2026.[Regarding another of these aspects,] education of stakeholders (e.g., owners, operators, tenants, authorities, designers), [they] should be further educated about building codes, the minimum design loads typically addressed for building design, and the extreme events that are not addressed by building codes. Should stakeholders desire to address events not included in the building codes, they should understand the process of developing and implementing strategies to mitigate damage from extreme events.Stakeholders should also be educated about the expected performance of their building when renovations, or changes in use or occupancy, occur and the building is subjected to different floor or fire loads. For instance, if the occupancy in a building changes to one with a higher fire hazard, stakeholders should have the fire protection systems reviewed to ensure there is adequate fire protection. Or, if the structural load is increased with a new occupancy, the structural support system should be reviewed to ensure it can carry the new load.\n",

Of those who were below the impact floors when the aircraft struck [7,545 people, as stated on p. 25 of the report], 99 percent survived. About 84 percent of all the occupants of the tower at the time survived. The aircraft impact damage left no exit path for those who were above the 91st floor. It is not known how many of those could have been saved had the building not collapsed. While it is possible that a delayed or avoided collapse could have improved the outcome, it would have taken many hours for the FDNY [Fire Department of the city of New York] to reach the 92nd floor and higher and then to conduct rescue and fire suppression activity there.\nThe following are specific facts derived from the interviews:\u2666The median time to initiate evacuation was 3 min for occupants from the ground floor to floor 76, and 5 min for occupants [on floors 77 through 91] near the impact region [between floors 93 and 91]. The factors that best explained the evacuation initiation delays were the floor the respondent was on when WTC was attacked, whether the occupant encountered smoke, damage or fire, and whether he or she sought additional information about what was happening.Occupants throughout the building observed various types of impact indicators throughout the building, including wall, partition, and ceiling damage and fire and smoke conditions.Damage to critical communications hardware likely prevented announcement transmission, and thus occupants did not hear announcements to evacuate, despite repeated attempts from the lobby fire command station.Evacuation rates reached a maximum in approximately 5 minutes, and remained roughly constant until the collapse of WTC 2, when the rate in WTC 1 slowed to about 20 percent of the maximum.The maximum downward travel rate was just over one floor per minute, slower than the slowest speed measured for non-emergency evacuation. This was in part because:\u2022Occupants encountered smoke and/or damage during evacuation.\u2022Occupants were often unprepared for the physical challenge of full building evacuation.\u2022Occupants were not prepared to encounter transfer hallways during the descent.\u2022Mobility-impaired occupants were not universally identified or prepared for full building evacuation.\u2022Occupants interrupted their evacuation.The mobility-impaired occupants did not evacuate as evenly as the general population.\u2022Those who were ambulatory generally walked down the stairs with one hand on each handrail, taking one step at a time. They were typically accompanied by another occupant or an emergency responder. Combined, they blocked others behind them from moving more rapidly.\u2022On the 12th floor, FDNY personnel found 40 to 60 people, some of whom were mobility impaired. The emergency responders were assisting about 20 of these mobility-impaired people down the stairs just prior to the collapse of the building. It is unknown how many of this group survived.\n\u2022Some mobility-impaired occupants requiring assistance to evacuate were left by coworkers, thereby imposing on strangers for assistance.\n",

Over 90 percent of the occupants had started to self-evacuate before the second aircraft struck, and three-quarters of those from above the 78th floor had descended below the impact region prior to the second attack. (Nearly 3,000 occupants were able to survive due to self-evacuation and the use of the still-functioning elevators.) As a result, 91 percent of all the occupants survived. Eleven people from below the impact floors perished, about 0.1 percent. Eighteen people in or above the impact zone when the plane struck are known to have found the one passable stairway and escaped. It is not known how many others from the impact floors or above found their way to the passable stairway and did not make it out or how many could have been saved had the building not collapsed. A delayed or avoided collapse could have provided the additional time for more people to learn about and use the passable stairway.The following are specific facts derived from the interviews:\u2666The median time to initiate evacuation was 6 minutes, somewhat longer than in WTC 1.As in WTC 1, occupants observed various types of impact indicators throughout the building, including wall, partition, and ceiling damage and fire and smoke conditions.Building announcements were cited by many as a constraint to their evacuation, principally due to the 9:00 a.m. announcement instructing occupants to return to their work spaces. Crowdedness in the stairways, lack of instructions and information, as well as injured or disabled evacuees in the stairwells were the most frequently reported obstacles to evacuation.Evacuation rates from WTC 2 showed three distinct phases:1.Before WTC 2 was attacked, occupants used elevators, as well as stairs, to evacuate, resulting in approximately 40 percent of the eventual survivors leaving the building during that 16 minute window.2.After WTC 2 was attacked and the elevators were no longer operational, the evacuation rate slowed down to a steady rate equivalent to the rate observed in WTC 1, which also had only stairs available to occupants.3.About 20 minutes prior to building collapse, the rate in WTC 2 slowed to approximately 20 percent of the stairwell-only evacuation rate.\n",

Buildings for use by the general population are not designed to withstand attacks of such severity; building regulations do not require building designs to consider aircraft impact. In our cities, there has been no experience with a disaster of such magnitude, nor has there been any in which the total collapse of a high-rise building occurred so rapidly and with little warning.While there were unique aspects to the design of the WTC towers and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, NIST has compiled a list of recommendations to improve the safety of tall buildings, occupants, and emergency responders based on its investigation of the procedures and practices that were used for the WTC towers; these procedures and practices are commonly used in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings under normal conditions. Public officials and building owners will need to determine appropriate performance requirements for those tall buildings, and selected other buildings, that are at higher risk due to their iconic status, critical function, or design.The eight major groups of recommendations are listed as follows in an order that does not reflect any priority:Increased Structural Integrity: The standards for estimating the load effects of potential hazards (e.g., progressive collapse, wind) and the design of structural systems to mitigate the effects of those hazards should be improved to enhance structural integrity.\nEnhanced Fire Endurance of Structures: The procedures and practices used to ensure the fire endurance of structures should be enhanced by improving the technical basis for construction classifications and fire resistance ratings, improving the technical basis for standard fire resistance testing methods, use of the \u201cstructural frame\u201d approach to fire resistance ratings, and developing in-service performance requirements and conformance criteria for sprayed [on] fire-resistance material.\nNew Methods for Fire Resistant Design of Structures: The procedures and practices used in the fire resistant design of structures should be enhanced by requiring an objective that uncontrolled fires result in burnout without local or global collapse. Performance-based\u2666\nmethods are an alternative to prescriptive design\u2666\u2666\nmethods. This effort should include the development and evaluation of new fire resistive coating materials and technologies and evaluation of the fire performance of conventional and high-performance structural materials.\nImproved Active Fire Protection: Active fire protection systems (i.e., sprinklers, standpipes/hoses, fire alarms, and smoke management systems) should be enhanced through improvements to design, performance, reliability, and redundancy of such systems.\nImproved Building Evacuation: Building evacuation should be improved to include system designs that facilitate safe and rapid egress, methods for ensuring clear and timely communications to occupants, better occupant preparedness for evacuation during emergencies, and incorporation of appropriate egress technologies.\nImproved Emergency Response: Technologies and procedures for emergency response should be improved to better enable better access to buildings, response operations, emergency communications, and command and control in large-scale emergencies.\nImproved Procedures and Practices: The procedures and practices used in the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of buildings should be improved to include encouraging code compliance by nongovernmental and quasi-governmental entities, adoption and application of egress and sprinkler requirements in codes for existing buildings, and retention and availability of building documents over the life of a building.\nEducation and Training: The professional skills of building and fire safety professionals should be upgraded through a national education and training effort for fire protection engineers, structural engineers, architects, and building regulatory and fire service personnel.\nThe recommendations call for action by specific entities regarding standards, codes, and regulations, their adoption and enforcement, professional practices, education, and training; and research and development. Only when each of the entities carries out its role will the implementation of a recommendation be effective.The recommendations do not prescribe specific systems, materials, or technologies. Instead, NIST encourages competition among alternatives that can meet performance requirements. The recommendations also do not prescribe specific threshold levels; NIST believes that this responsibility properly falls within the purview of the public policy setting process, in which the standards and codes development process plays a key role.NIST believes the recommendations are realistic and achievable within a reasonable period of time. Only a few of the recommendations call for new requirements in standards and codes. Most of the recommendations deal with improving an existing standard or code requirement, establishing a standard for an existing practice without one, establishing the technical basis for an existing requirement, making a current requirement risk-consistent, adopting or enforcing a current requirement, or establishing a performance-based alternative to a current prescriptive requirement.NIST strongly urges that immediate and serious consideration be given to these recommendations by the building and fire safety communities in order to achieve appropriate improvements in the way buildings are designed, constructed, maintained, and used in evacuation and emergency response procedures\u2014with the goal of making buildings, occupants, and first responders safer in future emergencies.NIST also strongly urges building owners and public officials to (1) evaluate the safety implications of these recommendations to their existing inventory of buildings and (2) take the steps necessary to mitigate any unwarranted risks without waiting for changes to occur in codes, standards, and practices.NIST further urges state and local agencies to rigorously enforce building codes and standards since such enforcement is critical to ensure the expected level of safety. Unless they are complied with, the best codes and standards cannot protect occupants, emergency responders, or buildings.\n",

            "text": "After publication of the NIST NCSTAR 1: Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster: Final Report of the National Construction Team on the Collapses of the World Trade Center Towers, the National Construction Safety Team Act required NIST to do the following:Conduct, or enable or encourage the conducting of, appropriate research recommended by the Team;Promote (consistent with existing procedures for the establishment of building standards, codes, and practices) the appropriate adoption by the Federal Government, and encourage the appropriate adoption by other agencies and organizations, of the recommendations of the Team with respect to\u2014\u2022Technical aspects of evacuation and emergency response procedures;\u2022Specific improvements to building standards, codes, and practices; and\u2022Other actions needed to help prevent future building failures.NIST is assigning top priority to work vigorously with the building and fire safety communities to assure that there is a complete understanding of the recommendations and to provide needed technical assistance in getting them implemented. NIST has identified specific codes, standards, and practices affected by each of the recommendations and begun to reach out to the responsible organizations to pave the way for a timely, expedited consideration of the recommendations.In addition, NIST has implemented a web-based system so that the public can track progress on implementing the recommendations. This web site will list each of the recommendations, the specific organization or organizations (e.g., standards and code developers, professional groups, state and local authorities) responsible for its implementation, the status of its implementation by organization, and the plans or work in progress to implement the recommendations.NIST has awarded a contract to the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) to convene a panel of building code experts, representing the diverse technical areas covered by the WTC recommendations, to carry out the following tasks:1.Develop a strategy for implementing relevant recommendations into model building codes.2.Develop awareness of activities of other groups already focusing on implementing the recommendations (e.g., NFPA,\u2666\nICC, ASCE 7, ASTM, AISC, ACI, AIA, and BOMA).\u2666\u2666\n3.Develop initial proposals for change to the model codes.4.Shepherd proposed changes through the code-change processes.5.Identify additional steps to be taken with respect to relevant standards.6.Identify any needed training and educational tools.The building code experts represent a broad spectrum of specific organizations (e.g., NFPA, ICC, ASCE, BOMA, and U.S. Accessibility Board) and areas of expertise (e.g., architecture, engineering, risk assessment, law enforcement, social science/egress, [security,] and insurance) that can address all of the recommendations. This core expertise will be augmented with the participation of other experts representing organizations and technical areas required to address one or more specific recommendations.The timeline for this effort is governed by the established development cycle for the model codes.The NIST WTC recommendations impact about 37 specific national standards, codes, and practice guidelines or regulations. In carrying out this work, NIST recognizes that not all of the recommendations will have an impact on model building codes. Many will impact standards that are referenced in model codes. Others will impact stand alone standards used in practice but not referenced in model codes. A few will impact practices, including education and training, that don't have any impact on codes and standards.73\u2666\n",

A car bomb also produces a large amount of shrapnel, or flying debris, that causes secondary damage to bystanders and buildings.\u201d79\nCar bombs and detonators function in a diverse manner of ways, and there are numerous variables in the operation and placement of the bomb within the vehicle. Earlier and less advanced car bombs were often wired to the car's ignition system, but this practice is now considered more laborious and less effective than other more recent methods, as it required a greater amount of work for a system that could often be quite easily defused. While it is more common nowadays for car bombs to be fixed magnetically to the underside of the car, the underneath of passenger/driver's seat, or inside of the mudguard, detonators triggered by the opening of the vehicle door or by pressure applied to the brakes or accelerating pedals are also used.80\n",

This bombing has been attributed to members of the Jemaah Islamiya (JI) terrorist organization, a Southeast Asian\u2013based terrorist network with links to al-Qa'ida, which allegedly helped finance the attack. The Bali bombing may have been carried out in response to audiotaped appeals from Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin and his senior deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri broadcast on the al-Jazeera network beginning on October 6, 2002, that urged renewed attacks on U.S. and Western interests.The FBI joined several other international antiterror agencies to assist Indonesia in the investigation of the attack. The investigation has yielded approximately 30 convictions overseas; including three suspects sentenced to death after being convicted of planning and carrying out the bombing. Notable among the convictions is Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, who is suspected of being the spiritual leader of JI. Bashir was sentenced in March 2003 to 30 months in prison for his part in the criminal conspiracy leading to the attack, although he was cleared of charges of planning a terrorist attack.Investigators believe JI militants Noordin Mohammad Top and bomb-maker Azahari Husin were the masterminds behind the Bali nightclub attacks and several other Southeast Asian terrorist attacks.

Three days after the attacks, blamed on Islamic militant groups including al-Qaeda, the then government was voted out of office. Its successors ended Spain's military involvement in Iraq. Meanwhile, Spain launched a massive manhunt for the perpetrators, eventually bringing 29 suspects to trial in February 2007.115 A Spanish court Wednesday convicted 21 in the 2004 bombing of Madrid's train system, the deadliest terrorist attack in continental Europe.116\n",

According to Stratfor,In July 1993, U.S. counterterrorism agents arrested eight individuals later convicted of plotting an elaborate, multistage attack on key sites in Manhattan. The militants, who were linked to Osama bin Laden's then-relatively new group, al Qaeda, planned to storm the island armed with automatic rifles, grenades and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In multiple raids on key targets combined with diversionary attacks, they aimed to kill as many people as possible.The planned attack, which came to be known as the \u201cLandmarks\u201d plot, called for several tactical teams to raid sites such as the Waldorf-Astoria, St. Regis and U.N. Plaza hotels, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, and a midtown Manhattan waterfront heliport servicing business executives and VIPs traveling from lower Manhattan to various New York\u2013area airports. The militants carried out extensive surveillance both inside and outside the target hotels using human probes, hand-drawn maps and video surveillance. Detailed notes were taken on the layout and design of the buildings, with stairwells, ballrooms, security cameras and personnel all reconnoitered.The attackers intended to infiltrate the hotels and disguise themselves as kitchen employees. On the day of the attack, one attack team planned to use stolen delivery vans to get close to the hotels, at which point heavily armed, small-cell commando teams would deploy from the rear of the van. Stationary operatives would use hand grenades to create diversions while attack teams would rake hotel guests with automatic weapons. The attackers planned to carry gas masks and use tear gas in hotel ballrooms to gain an advantage over any security they might come up against. They planned to attack at night, when the level of protection would be lower\u2026.A little more than fifteen years later, the Nov. 26 attacks in Mumbai closely followed the script of the New York plot. Militants armed with AK-47s, grenades and military-grade explosives carried out a very logistically sophisticated and coordinated attack on the financial capital of India.145\n",

The following details of these incidents were obtained from Twin Towers by Angus Kress Gillespie.146\nApril 7, 1974, New York City\u2014Starting at 7:15 AM, 24-year old French tightrope walker, Philippe Petit, walked back and forth seven or eight times on a tightrope cable stretched between the roofs of the 1,350-foot high Twin Towers. Three days before this heart-stopping display, Petit and three companions, all disguised as construction workers, used a freight elevator to transport cables and other equipment to the roof. On the night before the walk, they positioned themselves on each roof and used a five-foot crossbow to shoot an arrow, with a nylon fishing line attached, across from the north to the south Tower. Using the line, they then strung across a 131-foot cable and secured it in place.The next morning, Petit nonchalantly walked back and forth between the towers for nearly 75 minutes, stopping at times to sit down, lie down, and even hang from his feet. So many spectators gathered to watch that it caused a giant traffic jam on the streets below. Eventually, Petit was persuaded by a Port Authority police sergeant to come to the safety of the roof.July 22, 1975, New York City\u2014A skydiver parachuted from the north tower roof to the plaza 1350 feet below. A New York Times reporter, Lee Dembart, described how it was accomplished: \u201cWith his white parachute concealed in a green bag, 34-year old Owen J. Quinn, of 30\u201342 23rd Street, Astoria, eluded security guards on the 78th floor of the north tower, walked to the roof above the 110th floor, jumped off at 4:45 PM, and landed less than two minutes later on the raised ceremonial plaza between the buildings.\u201d147 Apart from some cuts and bruises on his leg, caused by the wind blowing him into the side of the building, he landed safely. Quinn, who said that he was trying to draw attention to the plight of the poor, was booked on charges of criminal trespass and reckless endangerment.May 27, 1977, New York City\u2014Starting at 6:30 AM, George W. Willig, a 27-year old amateur mountain climber, using special equipment that he designed to fit the window-washing equipment tracks, in three and a half hours climbed the outside of one of the Twin Towers. The spectacle was watched by thousands of onlookers on the ground and millions of viewers on television. When he safely reached the roof he was greeted by two police officers. Later, the city of New York sued him for a quarter of a million dollars to cover the costs of police overtime and the police helicopters that were dispatched to the scene to stop news helicopters from flying too close to the towers. The lawsuit was later dropped and Willig paid a $1.10 fine, which equated to a penny a floor.\n",

The modus operandi was always the same. The computers would disappear from locked tenant spaces after normal business hours. There were never any visible signs of unauthorized entry. Every conceivable pathway, the thief might have taken to remove the items from the building was examined. It was determined that the only possible means for removal of the items was using the single service/freight elevator. However, after normal business hours this elevator was always programmed to be \u201con security.\u201d It was finally ascertained that the elevator was being taken \u201coff security\u201d for a time period that coincided with the thefts. Further investigation revealed that a building engineer had accessed the elevator system remotely from his home computer and changed the elevator's security status. The engineer then had gone to the building and to the tenant floor using the freight elevator. The thefts were carried out using a building master key to gain access to the tenant suite. The stolen items were then loaded into the elevator car and transported down to the loading dock, where there were no CCTV cameras to view the incident.

Its cause has never been established, but investigators suspect that ash from a garment cutter's cigar or cigarette ignited a piece of material in a scrap bin on the eighth floor (Figure 3\u201311).The 10-story building had only one exterior fire escape and just two staircases when it should have had three. In addition, one of its two freight elevators was out of service. To prevent what some supervisors thought was an increase in pilferage, they'd further reduced the odds of escape by locking many of the exit doors.As the fire spread unchecked, workers grabbed the standpipe hose line and tried to extinguish it, but they quickly found that the hose had rotted and the valves were frozen shut. In a panic, the workers surged towards the most familiar exits, where they were met with a wall of flame racing up the stairs. Those who could scrambled to another exit and discovered that the door was locked. When they tried to force it open, they found that the door swung inward, and the press of people jammed it shut.Faced with a horrible death by fire, many of the workers, most of whom were young women, leapt to their deaths from the windows.The fire, which killed 146 people, marked a turning point in the way U.S. fire protection codes address such occupancies.173\n",

Fortunately, the building was unoccupied at the time, except for a handful of security personnel who evacuated safely.Despite the fact that a sprinkler system had been installed in the Parque Central the fire did more than U.S. $250 million in damage, burning the structure's contents from the 34th floor to the 50th. Why? Because, as previous inspections revealed, the sprinkler system had not been properly tested or maintained, thus it wasn't in a working condition; the building designers said local fire alarm panels weren't connected to a building-wide panel; and the standpipe system was inoperable at the time of the fire\u2026.225Past history and performance shows that this fire could probably have been controlled quickly by a standard wet-pipe sprinkler system and that the fire department's chances of controlling the fire at, or a few floors above, the floor of fire origin would have increased if the standpipe system had been working.

In addition the rapid spread of the fire above the 21st Floor appears to be due to failure of the compartmentation measures between the facade detail and the floor which is intended to prevent vertical fire spread.Fire safety design in many countries relies heavily on sprinkler protection to prevent fire growth and thereby limit possibilities for fire spread via the facade. The lack of sprinklers, along with the failure of compartmentation, appears to be an important factor in this case.Although there is a requirement to fire stop\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 the gap between the slab edge and the inside of the curtain wall, most codes do not address the tie-back connection of the curtain wall to the structure. Therefore a light facade structural element can heat up quickly and the resulting expansion can produce an outward bulging away from the slab edge, which can create internal flues if it happens before the facade glazing breaks. In other words by not considering the thermo-mechanical response of the system, there are no provisions to prevent such damage in Building Codes worldwide.An added complication in the case of Edificio Windsor was that the curtain wall facade had recently been replaced and it appears that a new support structure had been fixed onto the outside of the original mullion and transom arrangement. This means that there would have been a double-layered gap that needed to be fire stopped, complicating this detail still further\u2026.229Lessons to be learnedProcedures to ensure early call out to the Fire BrigadeProvisions for speedy access to the fire floor via protected fire fighting lifts and use of wet risers\nEffective compartmentation measures, including sprinkler protection for high-rise buildingsGood coordination of fire safety measures with refurbishment works and programme, especially in an occupied buildingStructural fire full frame analysis, rather than single element small-scale fire tests, as a basis for design.230\n\n",

Even if the emergency is genuine, it may occur at a time when the security forces are unprepared for the joint demands of emergency response and heightened security attention.\u201d233\nFor example, in a high-rise office building, an individual could set off a fire alarm by activating a manual fire alarm station. This should result in the evacuation of occupants from that floor, and floors above and below the incident (the actual number of floors will depend on the emergency plan for the building concerned). After all occupants have left, the person could then quickly roam unchallenged through offices and steal items (including possibly from handbags and billfolds in coats left behind in the hurry to evacuate). The thief could then enter a stairwell, descend to the ground level, and freely walk out of the building.",

Afterward, the thief could then board a passenger elevator\u2014because during fire alarm situations in many modern high-rise buildings, the elevators remain in service unless a smoke detector in the elevator lobby, elevator shaft, or elevator machine room has been activated\u2666\nor the elevators have been manually recalled from the Fire Command Center\u2014or reenter the stairwell and proceed down to the ground level to exit the building.

This increase in the number of stations and the more timely receipt of data has allowed us and other seismological centers to locate many small earthquakes which were undetected in earlier years, and we are able to locate earthquakes more rapidly.The NEIC now locates about 12,000 to 14,000 earthquakes each year or approximately 35 per day. Also, because of the improvements in communications and the increased interest in natural disasters, the public now learns about more earthquakes. According to long-term records (since about 1900), we expect about 18 major earthquakes (7.0\u20137.9) and one great earthquake (8.0 or above) in any given year. However, let's take a look at what has happened in the past 32 years, from 1969 through 2001, so far. Our records show that 1992, and 1995\u20131997 were the only years that we have reached or exceeded the long-term average number of major earthquakes since 1971. In 1970 and in 1971 we had 20 and 19 major earthquakes, respectively, but in other years the total was in many cases well below the 18 per year which we may expect based on the long-term average.2.The population at risk is increasing. While the number of large earthquakes is fairly constant, population density in earthquake-prone areas is constantly increasing. In some countries, the new construction that comes with population growth has better earthquake resistance; but in many it does not. So we are now seeing increasing casualties from the same sized earthquakes.3.Better global communication. Just a few decades ago, if several hundred people were killed by an earthquake in Indonesia or eastern China, for example, the media in the rest of the world would not know about it until several days, to weeks, later, long after such an event would be deemed \u201cnewsworthy.\u201d So by the time this information was available, it would probably be relegated to the back pages of the newspaper, if at all. And the public Internet didn't even exist. We are now getting this information almost immediately.4.Earthquake clustering and human psychology. While the average number of large earthquakes per year is fairly constant, earthquakes occur in clusters. This is predicted by various statistical models, and does not imply that earthquakes that are distant in location, but close in time, are causally related. But when such clusters occur, especially when they are widely reported in the media, they are noticed. However, during the equally anomalous periods during which no destructive earthquakes occur, no one deems this as remarkable.A temporal increase in earthquake activity does not mean that a large earthquake is about to happen. Similarly, quiescence, or the lack of seismicity, does not mean a large earthquake is going to happen. A temporary increase or decrease in the seismicity rate is usually just part of the natural variation in the seismicity. There is no way for us to know whether or not this time it will lead to a larger earthquake. Swarms of small events, especially in geothermal areas, are common, and moderate-large magnitude earthquakes will typically have an aftershock sequence that follows. All that is normal and expected earthquake activity.270\n",

Unlike braced frames, these moment frames feature larger beams and columns, with additional welding or bolting of the connections. Before this earthquake, this structural system was thought to be among the safest seismically. As John Hall, an associate professor of civil engineering at the California Institute of Technology, pointed out,During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, many modern steel buildings suffered unexpected fractures in welded beam-to-column connections. Although none of these buildings collapsed, fractured connections are a serious matter since they reduce the lateral strength of the structure, and, thereby, increase the risk of collapse. The problem is apparently widespread and, at this point, one must assume that any welded steel moment-frame is susceptible to this type of connection failure.276\n",

However, the high intensity of the Northridge earthquake pushed even steel moment frame buildings to their seismic limits, causing damage not experienced before. More than 50 relatively new 2- to 10-story structures that sustained brittle structural damage have been identified at the time of writing this report. Such damage raises troubling questions about the seismic resistance of this type of construction. Damage took the form of cracks in welds and rupture of steel sections at connections of beams to columns and columns to the base plate\u2014both areas are critical for stability of the structure. Steel-framed buildings are designed to absorb energy by bending without breaking. However, the failure of welded connections would not allow the level of bending assumed in design and can cause brittle failures. Steel members in existing buildings are covered with fireproofing and are not readily available for inspection. Thus, damage caused by the quake may go unnoticed unless a detailed and costly inspection program is undertaken. The damage to steel moment frame buildings has potentially the highest structural significance of the Northridge earthquake and will probably result in substantial research and associated design code changes.277\n",

Data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,347\nindicate that, in recent years, an average of 500 to 600 American workers die annually as a result of violence on the job. And according to Richardson and Windau,348\nabout three-quarters of workplace homicides result from injuries inflicted with guns.The seriousness of homicide has made it the focus of the concern about workplace violence. The rate of workplace homicide has declined gradually since the 1980s and fell somewhat more rapidly than the rate for all homicides in the 1990s.349\nNevertheless, homicide is the third leading cause of death on the job for all workers in the United States, and the leading cause of death for women.\nArgentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong and China, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, and Ukraine\u2014according to a study for the International Labour Organization (ILO) which shows that\n350\nViolence at work is increasing worldwide and has reached epidemic levels in some countries. Situations described range from bullying and mobbing (where a group of workers targets an individual), to threats, sexual harassment and homicide. Professions once regarded as largely immune are increasingly involved in both developed and developing countries.In Germany, a 2002 study estimated that more than 800,000 workers were the victims of mobbing. In Spain, an estimated 22 per cent of officials in public administration were victims of this form of violence. In France, reported acts of aggression against transport workers rose from 3051 in 2001 to 3185 in 2002.In Japan, 625,572 consultation requests were brought before court counsellors between April 2002 and March 2003 of which almost 32,000 (5.1 per cent) were related to harassment and bullying. This compares to data for April to September 2003 when 9.6 per cent of 51,444 requests concerned bullying and harassment.In Malaysia, 11,851 rape and molestation cases in the workplace were reported between 1997 and May 2001. Widespread sexual harassment and abuse were major concerns in a number of countries including South Africa, Ukraine, Kuwait and Hong Kong and China.Australia has estimated costs to employers to be between A$6 and 13 billion.Many countries have explicitly recognized violence in occupational health and safety legislation. Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Poland and Sweden are among countries that have recently adopted legislation or amended existing laws and regulations to address workplace violence.\n",

It may be appropriate, in certain situations, to use access cards or other locking devices, a receptionist who can unlatch a door, the installation of duress alarms as a back-up measure (in conjunction with a [CCTV] camera system to monitor the duress alarm locations), or security personnel.Establish a clear anti-violence management policy and set boundaries as to what is considered acceptable behavior. Policies should be applied consistently and fairly to all employees, including supervisors and managers. Provide appropriate supervisory and employee training in workplace violence prevention.Establish procedures for investigating occupational injury or illness arising from a workplace assault or a threat of assault.Implement procedures to handle threats of violence by employees, including a policy on when to notify law enforcement agencies.Establish procedures to allow employees to confidentially report threats, and to protect them from physical retaliation for these reports.Provide training on how to recognize workplace security hazards, how to prevent workplace assaults, and what to do when an assault occurs, including emergency action and post emergency procedures. Give employees instruction in crime awareness, assault and rape prevention, and hostile situation diffusion. For example, if employees work late at night, encourage them to keep their doors locked, and either to leave the building with a fellow employee or to call security for an escort to their vehicle.If a workplace assault occurs, reduce the short- and long-term physical and emotional effects of the incident by providing post event trauma counseling to those who desire such intervention.353\n\n",
