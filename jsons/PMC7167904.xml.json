Initial studies described the end\u2010organ effects of this infection 4. Subsequently, tissue studies contributed to the identification of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as one of the cellular receptors for SARS\u2010CoV and documented the tissue distribution of both the virus and ACE2 5, 6, 7.",

This association has clear clinical implications 9, not only for the diagnosis of HPV\u2010associated disease, but also for its prevention, with recent vaccination trials having been the subject of significant media attention 10.

A variety of different viral types are involved, including retroviruses, particularly HIV, and herpesviruses, particularly EBV, but these viruses employ different carcinogenetic mechanisms, as discussed in the review by Jarrett 13.

Since the genome of the causative agent, Treponema pallidum, was sequenced in 1998, progress has been made in understanding the underlying cell and molecular biology/pathology of this infection, as discussed by Peeling and Hook 20. This includes improved understanding of the immune response to treponemal infection, which may allow the development of vaccine strategies for the prevention of this disease.",

The theme of the host\u2013organism relationship is developed by Komatsuzawa et al\n22, who illustrate, in relation to S. aureus infection, that methicillin\u2010resistant strains (MRSA) are more resistant than methicillin\u2010sensitive strains (MSSA), not only to antibiotic therapy, but also to innate immune factors.",
