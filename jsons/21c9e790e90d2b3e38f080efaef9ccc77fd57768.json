They are vitally important in life cycle and have become a main target for drug design. This Chapter is focused on a special protease that plays a key role in replicating SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus, the culprit of SARS disease. The progresses reported here are mainly from various computational approaches, such as structural bioinformatics, pharmacophore modelling, 2 K.-C. Chou et al. molecular docking, and peptide-cleavage site prediction, among others. It is highlighted that the compounds C 28 H 34 O 4 N 7 Cl, C 21 H 36 O 5 N 6 and C 21 H 36 O 5 N 6 , as well as KZ7088, a derivative of AG7088, might be the promising candidates for further investigation, and that the octapeptides ATLQAIAS and ATLQAENV, as well as AVLQSGFR, might be converted to effective inhibitors against the SARS protease. Meanwhile, how to modify these octapeptides based on the \"distorted key\" theory to make them become potent inhibitors is explicitly elucidated. Also, a brief introduction is given for how to use computer-generated graphs to rapidly diagnose SARS coronavirus. Finally, a step-by-step protocol guide is given on how to use ProtIdent, a web-server developed recently, to identify the proteases and their types based on their sequence information alone. ProtIdent is a very user-friendly bioinformatics tool that can provide desired information for both basic research and drug discovery in a timely manner. With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is particularly useful. ProtIdent is freely accessible to the public via the web-site at",

The functional importance of the protease in the viral life cycle has made it an attractive target for developing drugs against SARS. To conduct the rational (or structure-based) drug design, a key step is to understand the binding interaction of SARS CoV Mpro with its ligands.",

            "text": "Based on the atomic coordinates of SARS-CoV Mpro (Anand et al., 2003) , two binding models were developed (Chou et al., 2003) . One is for the binding interaction of SARS-CoV Mpro with a compound called KZ7088 ( Fig. 1.1a) , and the other is for that with the octapeptide AVLQSGFR. Chou et al., 2003. With permission) KZ7088 (Chou et al., 2003) is a derivative of AG7088 ( Fig. 1.1b) . The latter was developed by Pfizer Inc. and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of rhinovirus, a pathogen that can cause the common cold. As shown in Fig. 1. 1, AG7088 has a p-fluorophenylalanine side chain (p-fluorobenzyl), which is too long (or bulky) to fit into the binding pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro. By removing -CH2 from the side chain, the compound KZ7088 thus obtained could well fit into the binding pocket, as shown in Fig. 1.2 . The constituents of the binding pocketare defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom (i.e., other than hydrogen) with a distance \u22645 \u00c5 from a heavy atom of KZ7088. A similar bindingpocket was defined for ATP in the Cdk5-Nck5a * -ATP complex (Chou et al., 1999) and other studies (see, e.g., Troy, 2003, 2005a, b; Chou, 2004b; Wei et al.,2006a; Wang et al., 2007a, b; Li et al., 2007a, b; Gu et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2009) . The binding pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro for KZ7088 involved 23 residues, and the ligand was tethered to the enzyme by six hydrogen bonds, as detailed in (Chou et al., 2003) . A series of follow-up discussions about the binding mechanism can be found in Zhang and Yap, 2004; Samee, 2005; Clercq, 2006) .",

(3) According to the \"lock-and-key\" mechanism in enzymology, the octapeptide cleavable by the SARS protease must have a good fit for binding to the active site. However, such a peptide, after a modification of its scissile bond with some simple routine procedure, will completely lose its cleavability but it can still bind to the active site. Actually, the molecule thus modified can be compared to a \"distorted key\" (Chou, 1996) , which can be inserted into a lock but can neither open the lock nor be pulled out from it, spontaneously becoming an ideal competitive inhibitor against the SARS proteinase.",

Based on the pharmacophore template, the virtual screening search operation was performed by Sirois and co-workers for the commercially and academically available compounds. It was found by pharmacophore searches that, of the 3.6 millions of compounds screened, 0.07% were with the score satisfying five of the six pharmacophore points as defined by the four hydrogen bond acceptors and two hydrogen bond donors ( Fig.  1.4) . Moreover, each of the hit compounds was further evaluated for its drugability according to a novel score function, an equation formulated by 13 metrics that took into account physical (Lipinski, 2000) , chemical and structural properties (Xu and Stevenson, 2000) , as well the presence of undesirable functional groups (Oprea, 2000; Rishton, 1997) . The selection of these properties was based on the work proposed by Baurin (Baurin, 2002) . After such a drugability-evaluating procedure, it was found that 17% of the compounds thus retrieved from the first hit screen had a perfect score of 1.0, 23% with one violation of drugable rule, 13% with two violations, and 47% with more than two violations. If the criterion for drugability was set at a maximum allowance of two violations, we obtained that only 0.07 \u00d7 (0.17 + 0.23 + 0.13) = 0.037 Fig. 1.4 A template of the pharmacophore points of KZ7088 derived from its binding interaction with SARS-CoV M pro (Chou et al., 2003) .

These findings would significantly narrow down the search scope for potential compounds, saving substantial time and money. Finally, the featured templates derived from the pharmacophore study would also be very useful for guiding the design and synthesis of effective drugs for SARS therapy.",

(2004) , 1,386 drugable compounds were collected by Wei and co-workers that both match the 3D (dimensional) KZ7088 pharmacophore points and satisfy the drugable rules with a scoring value \u22650.8. It was found via similarity search and auto docking operation that only three compounds, i.e., C 28 H 34 O 4 N 7 Cl, C 21 H 36 O 5 N 6 , and C 21 H 36 O 5 N 6 , were the most promising candidates worthy of further investigation. Meanwhile, a thermodynamic analysis indicated that the hydrogen bonds make an important contribution to the interactions of SARS-CoV Mpro with these compounds, which is quite consistent with the case of KZ7088 (Chou et al., 2003) . In addition to hydrogen bonds, there are some other contributions to the interactions, such as desolvation, hydrophobic interaction, and electrostatic interaction. The hydrogen bonds may play the role as an \"anchor\", determining the spatial position of the compounds in the binding pocket, thus facilitating the hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, in conducting rational drug design it is critic to identify the hydrophobic groups of the ligand and receptor and make sure that they are facing to each other upon binding. Also, it was observed by examining the Connolly surface (Connolly, 1993) of the complex of SARS-CoV Mpro with each of the three compounds that the steric complementarity is responsible for the micro-mechanical interlock at the molecular level. In other words, it is the steric complementarity between the ligand and the collagen receptor site that plays the role of the primary driving force for mechanical interlocking.",

            "text": "According to the \"lock-and-key\" mechanism in enzymology, a proteasecleavable peptide must satisfy the substrate specificity, i.e., a good match for binding to the active site. Here, the phrase of \"good match\" should be understood in a broad sense rather than a narrow geometric sense; i.e., it means a favourable chemical-group-disposition for the binding of a substrate to the active site of an enzyme and the catalytic reaction thereof. However, such a peptide, after a modification of its scissile bond with some chemical procedure, will completely lose its cleavability but it can still bind to the active site of an enzyme. Actually, the molecule thus modified can be compared to a \"distorted key\", which can be inserted into a lock but can neither open the lock nor be pulled out from it. That is why a molecule modified from a cleavable peptide can spontaneously become a competitive inhibitor against the enzyme. An illustration about using the concept of \"distorted key\" to find peptide inhibitor for the SARS enzyme is given in Fig. 1 .5, where panel (a) shows an effective binding of a cleavable peptide to the active site of SARS CoV M pro , while panel (b) shows that the peptide has become a non-cleavable one after its scissile bond is modified although it can still bind to the active site. Such a modified peptide, or \"distorted key\", will automatically become an inhibitor candidate against SARS CoV M pro . It is instructive to point out that, even for the case of developing non-peptide inhibitors, the knowledge thus acquired can also provide useful insights for the key binding groups, proper microenvironment, fitting conformation, among many other subtle requirements. Therefore, it will significantly reduce the search scope and expedite the process for finding the desired peptide inhibitors if a computational method is available by which one can discern what kind of peptides can be cleaved by SARS CoV M pro . That is why during the process of developing inhibitors against HIV protease many algorithms were developed (Chou, 1993a, b; Poorman et al., 1991; Chou et al., 1993 Chou et al., , 1996 Zhang and Chou, 1993; Thompson et al., 1995; Cai and Chou, 1998; You et al., 2005; Liang and Li, 2007; Rognvaldsson et al., 2007) for predicting the cleavable peptides by HIV protease. Very recently, a freely accessible web-server called HIVcleave was also established for identifying the cleavage sites of proteins by HIV protease.",

The results are given in Fig. 1.6 , where panel (a) shows the lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of amino acid side chains of the 11 cleavable peptides, and panel (b) shows the pharmacophore types of atoms in the relevant amino acid side chains. As shown in the figure, residues at R 2 and R 4 are the most lipophilic; residues at R 1\u2032 and R 3\u2032 are partially lipophilic residues. On the other hand, residues at R 1 are the most hydrophilic, and residues at R 3 and R 4 are partially hydrophilic residues. The residues at R 2\u2032 could be lipophilic or hydrophilic. The size of side chain of R 1\u2032 is very small, and the volumes of side chains of residues R 3 , R 2 and R 3\u2032 are larger than the others. Aromatic groups are on the positions R 2 and R 3\u2032 . Subsequently, the docking operations were performed for the 11 cleavable peptides with respect to SARS CoV M pro .

However, a cleavable peptide can become an effective inhibitor after some proper chemical modification, as elaborated in Chou, 1996 . Converting the cleavable peptides to stable and bio-available drugs is a hot research topic in medicinal chemistry (Chou, 1996 Du et al., 2004) . Some possible chemical modification methods in this regard were analyzed . According to the distorted key theory (Chou, 1996) , a cleavable oligopeptide can automatically become a competitive inhibitor if its scissile peptide bond between R 1 and R 1\u2032 is replaced by a strong \"hybrid peptide bond\" (cf. Fig. 1.5) . For the case of NH 2 -ATLQ\u2193AIAS-COOH, the position R 1 and R 1\u2032 is occupied by amino acids Gln and Fig. 1.6 The alignment of the 11 cleavable peptides.

The green is for hydrophobic regions and the blue is for hydrophilic regions. The cleavable peptide P9 is shown as space filling model. The bioactive pocket is the cleavage cavity between domains I and II of protomer A Ala. The peptide bond CO \u04cd NH between Gln and Ala is considered as a pseudo conjugate \u03c0-bond (here we use CO \u04cd NH to emphasize the conjugate \u03c0-bond), which is easily hydrolyzed by SARS CoV M pro . If the group CO is replaced by CH 2 , or NH is replaced by CH 2 , the conjugate \u03c0-bond will become a strong single bond, and hence the hydrolyzation will become very difficult Szelke et al., 1982; Venkatesan and Kim, 2002) . In general, the methylamino isostere is prepared by reduction of the amide bond with different reducing agents or by reductive amination of an amino aldehyde (Benkirane et al., 1996) . The isostere has been incorporated into the ras farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitor that is a potential anticancer drug (Graham et al., 1994) . Pseudo peptide analogs containing reduced amide isostere are also shown to inhibit C \u03b1 -N-C cleavage in the gag region of HIV-1 protease (Lowther et al., 1995) . It was also observed by quantum chemistry calcula-tions ) that after CO was replaced by CH 2 , the charge of the carbon atom in CH 2 turned to negative (\u22120.6572) from original a positive value (0.8612) in CO group, hence the nucleophilic attack by OH \u2212 became impossible. Furthermore, the negative charge of N(NH) on the Ser side decreased to \u22120.2892 from \u22120.8190, and hence the electrophilic attack by H + became more difficult as well.",

(Gan et al., 2006) indicated that the octapeptide AVLQSGFR proposed originally in (Chou et al., 2003) was indeed cleavable by SARS-CoV M pro with a high bioactivity. Based on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro (Yang et al., 2003) , the cleavage mechanism of the SARS-CoV M pro on the octapeptide NH 2 -AVLQ\u2193SGFR-COOH (Chou et al., 2003) was investigated using molecular mechanics (MM) and quantum mechanics (QM) (Du et al., 2005b) . It has been observed that the catalytic dyad (His-41/Cys-145) site between domain I and II of the protease [4,5] attracts \u03c0-electron density from the peptide bond Gln-Ser, increasing the positive charge on C(CO) of Gln and the negative charge on N(NH) of Ser, so as to weaken the Gln-Ser peptide bond. The catalytic functional group is the imidazole group of His-41 and the S in Cys-145. N \u03b41 on imidazole ring plays the acid-base catalytic role. It has also been found that the chemical bond between Gln and Ser will become much stronger and no longer cleavable by the SARS enzyme after either changing the carbonyl group CO of Gln to CH 2 or CF 2 , or changing the NH of Ser to CH 2 or CF 2 . According to the \"distorted key theory\" (Chou, 1996) , the octapeptide thus modified might become an effective inhibitor against SARS-CoV M pro or a potential drug candidate for SARS therapeutics.",

They concluded that the V-shaped cross-lines image pattern might be deemed as a fingerprint for SARS coronal viruses for rapidly diagnosing SARS coronavirus. Subsequently, Gao and co-workers (Gao et al., 2006) developed another graphic method for visualizing the characteristic of SARS-CoV.

Meanwhile, it is elucidated according to the \"distorted key\" theory that the octapeptides ATLQAENV and AVLQSGFR may be converted to effective inhibitors against the SARS enzyme. Also, how to modify these octapeptides and make them become potent inhibitors is suggested.
