SCoV, a Group Four coronavirus, is enveloped, with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of about 29,727 nucleotides in length. Based on the sequenced complete SCoV genomes, SCoV encodes at least five major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) (Peiris et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003), and the newly identified ORF3a (Shen et al., 2005), which are common to all known coronaviruses. SCoV can cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) at autopsy (Peiris et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2003). At present, there is no vaccine or specific effective antiviral method available to treat this disease effectively.",

Transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells leads to the degradation of the target gene mRNA or to the arrest of protein translation silence of the protein expression (Fire et al., 1998, Elbashir et al., 2001). Therefore, siRNA-mediated RNAi may provide a useful approach to study host cell-virus interactions and to serve as possible therapeutics in virus infection. siRNAs have been employed as therapeutic molecules in human diseases including cancer, neurogenerative diseases and viral infectious diseases (Shi, 2003, Dy kxhoorn et al., 2003). SCoV, as a RNA virus, may also be an ideal target for the study of its biology and therapeutics by RNAi method.",

            "text": "To date, there are a number of published papers showing that siRNA/shRNA (short hairpin RNA) target different regions or genes in the SCoV genome by various siRNA/shRNA generating strategies. RNAase III specific siRNA targeting the RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RDRP), or the S and N genes, could induce specific degradation of SCoV mRNAs in human cells (Zhu et al., 2004). Synthesized shRNA targeting the N protein (Tao et al., 2005) and RDRP (Lu et al., 2004), could inhibit the expression of target protein, and the latter significantly reducing the plaque forming ability of SCoV in Vero-E6 cells. siRNA targeting the E, M and N proteins (Shi et al., 2005), leader sequence, TRS, 3\u2032-UTR or the S gene (Wu et al., 2005, Qin et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2004) could effectively inhibit the expression of these targets. Plasmid-derived siRNA targeting to RDRP (Meng et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2004), the leader sequence (B.J. Li et al., 2005, T. Li et al., 2005), and to the non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) could specifically inhibit the expression of target protein and also suppress the replication and propagation of SCoV in cultured Vero E6 cell lines (Ni et al., 2005). The effect of siRNAs/shRNAs probably resulted in global reduction of subgenome synthesis and subsequent protein expression of SCoV. Therefore, to screen more valid siRNAs targets in SCoV genome will be important to provide more information for the development of better SCoV prophylaxis and therapy.",

Then the EcoRI\u2013BamHI fragment was inserted into the corresponding multi-cloning site of a eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech). The resulting plasmid was named pEGFP-M, in which the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene was located downstream of the M gene. Identity of the M gene to the published sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Bioasia Co., Shanghai).

A scramble siRNA sequence (Wilson et al., 2003) and EGFP siRNA (Cao et al., 2004) were used as negative and positive controls for silencing, respectively. All sequences of the siRNAs were BLAST searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI), and were not found to have significant homology to genes other than the targets. The DNA template (Table 1\n) used for siRNA transcription was synthesized by Bioasia Co. The oligonucleotide-directed production of siRNAs with T7 RNA polymerase has been described previously (Qin et al., 2004). For each transcription reaction, 300 \u03bcM of each oligonucleotide template and T7 promoter primer were mixed and denatured by heating at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min. The following was then added to the mixture: 10\u00d7 Klenow reaction buffer, dNTP mix (Promega, USA), Exo-Klenow (TaKaRa, Dalian) and nuclease-free water. The reaction was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min.

After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, sense and antisense RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both transcription reactions and incubating at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The concentration of the generated dsRNA was measured by the absorbance at 260 nm in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). S1 nuclease and RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 1 U/\u03bcg of siRNA, respectively, for the digestion of ssRNA and dsDNA. siRNAs were assessed by RNA gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose.",

Furthermore, the applications of these specifically designed siRNAs, 19\u201323 nt in length, in animal models have recently made great progress, including the siRNAs targeting Hepatitis B Virus (Xuan et al., 2006), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (Murakami et al., 2005), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Ping et al., 2004). Based on the extensive screening of the effective siRNAs in vitro, some proper modifications were adopted to improve the efficacy and duration of siRNAs for additional in vivo use. For example, endoribonuclease-prepared siRNAs can efficiently inhibit HBV replication in a mouse model (Xuan et al., 2006), which might be a better therapeutic agent to fight against HBV.",
