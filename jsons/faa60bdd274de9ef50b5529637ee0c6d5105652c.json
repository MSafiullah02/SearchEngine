The extistence of over 100 immunologically distinct serotypes makes serotype specific assays, such as ELISA, unsuitable for general diagnostic assays. In this study a general rhinovirus assay is described which utilises synthetic oligonucleotides as probes in a filter hybridization assay. The probes are designed to bind to short but highly conserved regions of the rhinovirus genome. Indeed, the probes successfully detected all 57 rhinovirus serotypes tested. Furthermore, the test was used to demonstrate rhinovirus infection in clinical samples from 57 volunteers, inoculated with HRV, collected on six consecutive days. Clinical samples were taken prior to inoculation and on days 2-7 after inoculation. The filter hybridization assay gave results comparable to virus culture on days 2 and 3 post-inoculation, but was more sensitive on subsequent days.",

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are the major causative agents of the common cold, a frequent, although usually minor, infection in man [5] . The high incidence of infections can be explained, at least in part, by the existence of over 100 immunologically distinct HRV serotypes, several of which can co-circulate within a community [6] . In immunocompromised individuals and in children with a history of bronchitis or allergy HRV infection can be very much more serious [2] . Advances are being made in antiviral chemotherapy for respiratory infections [1] but as the drugs are quite specific in their action, the type of virus causing the infection needs to be determined. A number of respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and adenoviruses, can now be detected rapidly by either immunofluorescence or ELISA. An ELISA has recently been developed to detect HRV directly in nasal washings but the test was found to be generally serotype specific [3] . Because of the large number of H R V serotypes, such assays are not useful in the general diagnosis of H R V infection. Thus, cultivation of virus in cell culture remains the only general method available to diagnose rhinovirus infection.",

Comparison of the available sequence data indicated a high degree of homology in the 5' non-coding region of the genome of rhinoviruses (about 90% between any pair of HRVs). This region is also highly homologous to the corresponding region of enteroviruses such as CA21 and poliovirus [8] . We therefore felt that a c D N A probe from the 5' non-coding end of the rhinovirus genome could potentially be useful as a \"general\" rhinovirus probe. However, in a comparative study of a number of c D N A probes prepared from the 5' non-coding region of HRVs 14, 9, and 1B we found that, while these probes are useful in examining the genomic relationships between the different rhinovirus serotypes, they do not detect all rhinovirus serotypes with equal efficiency. Therefore such probes are not suitable as diagnostic probes [A1-Nakib, unpubl, data].",

We chose two of the longer conserved regions, 18 and 22 bases, and synthesised complementary oligonucleotides.

Film exposed for four days were clearly detected although the intensity of the signal varied considerably. It was shown that this was due to variations in the amount of RNA in the samples. Figure 2 shows the results when equal amounts of RNA were applied to the filter for several different HRV serotypes and it can be seen that the ratio of the intensity of the signal to the amount of RNA was constant.

Indeed, using filter hybridization, we have also demonstrated that the probes can detect HRV RNA directly in clinical samples. In a study involving 57 volunteers inoculated with HRV 14, the probe detected as many rhinovirus positive samples as conventional virus cultures during the first two days of virus shedding. However, later in the course of infection, days 4-7, the probe detected more positive samples than culture. Overall the hybridization assay found 54 rhinovirus positive volunteers as compared with 41 by tissue culture. The two methods detected approximately equal numbers of positives among symptomatic volunteers, 22 by hybridization and 21 by tissue culture. However, hybridization detection more evidence of infection among asymptomatic volunteers than culture. This may be due to several factors. Very little is known about the particle number to infectious dose ratio. It is known that non-infectious particles are formed at some stages of an infection. If these were to contain the appropriate region of the genome (5' non-coding region) the hybridization assay would detect these non-infectious particles whereas culture methods would not. Also at later stages of infection, many of the virus particles may be antibody bound, again preventing detection by culture but not by hybridization. Further experiments would be required to determine the reason for the differences between the two methods.",
