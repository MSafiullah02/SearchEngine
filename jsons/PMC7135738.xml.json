Investing in this capacity in developing countries is thus increasingly seen as a shared concern within the global community. As a result multilateral and bilateral donors committed a total of US$582 million in loans and grants to buttress the response capacity of developing and middle-income countries.1 While there is broad agreement on the need for additional funding, there is less clarity on how the funds should be spent. Although the developed world has invested its bioterror- and pandemic-preparedness dollars and euros into building highly specialized emergency-response capacity, it is not clear whether this could or should be replicated in the developing world, where public health infrastructure is weak due to years of under-investment and where there are urgent, competing public health priorities that by necessity take center stage.2\n",

Such an approach could offer developing countries an opportunity to strengthen their public health system platforms, allowing them to respond to multiple priority diseases rather than creating specialized programs that will likely be difficult to sustain in the longer term. First, it reviews evidence from developed countries on the impacts of emergency preparedness for bioterrorism and pandemic influenza\u2014which require similar public health system responses\u2014on public health departments and the overall public health system, focusing on investments proven to have substantial collateral impacts on other public health activities.

Two hundred and five people were infected with an overall case fatality rate of 56%.3, 4 If H5N1 or a similar virus improves the efficiency of its human-to-human transmission, such an outbreak could precipitate a major global pandemic.1 Globally, other emerging diseases, such as Ebola, Marburg; drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB); and others are also on the rise.5 Jungles and other ecosystems in low- and middle-income countries have frequently been the source of emerging diseases. The Ebola, Marburg and Lassa hemorrhagic fever viruses, as well as the virus responsible for Rift Valley Fever, are native to Africa.6 H5N1 influenza spread from migratory birds in Asia to birds in Africa and Europe in 1996\u2014a path that could be followed by a more lethal human form of the virus.7\n",

Vital registry data from the influenza epidemic of 1918, which likewise may have originated in birds, showed a 30-fold difference in mortality rates between some of the most- and least-developed regions of the world; this is thought to be due in large part to the effects of poverty, including the lack of supportive care, as well as poor nutrition and high levels of comorbidity.12, 13 While experts note that even in the U.S. a major influenza epidemic would likely overwhelm the public health capacity, epidemiologic modeling suggests that if a global influenza pandemic similar to that of 1918 were to have happened in 2004, 96% of the deaths globally would have been in developing countries, with 59% in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, two of the world's poorest regions.12, 14, 15 The mortality rate would be 1.6% in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia versus 0.2% in the wealthy countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).12\n",

Pandemic planning requires mathematical modeling of disease and mortality projections and their corresponding impacts on health service utilization, health costs, and other health system process indicators. Such modeling requires epidemiologists and biostatisticians as well as health planners, economists, and administrators. The same people can also perform a wide variety of essential public health tasks, such as monitoring the incidence of priority infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS) and estimating the impact of seasonal epidemics (e.g., malaria). Health economists can assist countries in estimating the resources required to respond to an emergency and to expand the health system to tackle existing morbidity.",

For example, nearly 40% of urban Ugandan teenagers who attend high school reported looking for health information on the Internet, suggesting that it is emerging as a powerful tool for health education.66 In many developing countries, health education materials for existing diseases, whether for the public or for health workers, are often of low quality, may not be in local languages, and are often outdated.67 Investing in health communication would thus benefit broader health goals.",
