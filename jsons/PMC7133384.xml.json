By 19 February 2020, over 70 000 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have been reported, with over 1800 patients died. At least 12 neonates have been diagnosed with COVID-19.2 Newborn infants deserve more concern due to their immature immune system and the possibility of mother to infant transmission. Neonatologists belonging to the Chinese Neonatologist Association of Chinese Doctor Association have proposed measurements for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in neonates.",
