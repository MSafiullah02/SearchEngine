To facilitate manual access, a 6-cm horizontal skin incision is made in the right upper quadrant. The location of this skin incision depends on the patient\u2019s body habitus and/or the size of the spleen. When the patient has splenomegaly, a laparoscope is introduced through the subumbilical port. After the laparotomy incision is made, a hand port (LAP DISC, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) is introduced through that incision. A second 12-mm port is then introduced 7 cm to the left of the umbilicus.",

The surgeon\u2019s left hand is used to increase tension between the spleen and the greater curvature of the stomach, which makes the approach much easier and safer than the standard laparoscopic approach.20 The division of the gastrosplenic ligament and devascularization of the short gastric vessels are accomplished with the same device. After the aforementioned steps are completed, the surgeon\u2019s finger can pass through the dorsal side of the splenic hilum. Using that hand to assist, the operator can directly palpate the pulsation of arteries during the operation. In doing so, if there is a rupture of the collateral vessels during the procedure, the operator can place direct pressure to achieve immediate hemostatic control. Immediate and direct hemostatic control with the surgeon\u2019s hand is an important advantage of the hand-assisted technique. A 40-mm linear stapler (white color) (Endo-GIA, United States Surgical, Norwalk, CT, USA) is inserted into the splenic hilum. Both the splenic artery and vein are divided together by this procedure. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the splenic artery and vein are sometimes dilated and run irregularly. As it is always difficult to isolate these vessels, we divide them together using a linear stapler. The spleen is then mobilized from the retroperitoneum. The freely mobile spleen is removed from the abdominal cavity by bag via a minilaparotomy incision.",

The devascularization is performed between the gastric serosa and dilated veins. With the use of a Liga-Sure Atlas device, this procedure can be performed without significant bleeding. Then the gastrohepatic ligament is opened and devascularization of the lesser curvature is performed by the same method. At this point in a patient with gastric varices, a large draining vein will be seen in the area of upper gastric fundus. This vessel is ligated with laparoscopic clips. Then, after isolation of the anterior and posterior vagus nerves with the surgeon\u2019s finger, the esophagus is pulled downward.

To minimize these complications we suggest a technique that can be performed by the surgeon during the operation. A gastric drainage procedure is usually recommended to prevent subsequent postovagotomy gastric outlet obstruction from pylorospasm. To perform this technique, the surgeon reaches into the pylorus and grasps the sphincter muscle, which can then be crushed to facilitate gastric emptying postoperatively (finger bougie method). This procedure has been reported to be successful after truncal vagotomy.21,22 Finally, a closed suction drain is placed into the splenic fossa and the operation is completed.",

This procedure was first practiced and introduced by Warren and colleagues in 1967.27 It involves selective drainage of the esophagogastric venous complex into the systemic circulation. In experienced hands, DRSR is quite effective in decompressing the portal pressure and arresting active variceal bleeding. However, the procedure is technically complicated, and unfortunately few centers have adequate expertise. A meta-analysis has shown that the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and mortality was increased significantly either in nonselective or selective shunt operations.13 Recently, a small-diameter interposition portocaval shunt using a polytetrafluoroethylene graft (H-graft portocaval shunt, HGPCS) has been described. Rosemurgy et al.8 have reported that the H-graft maintains its patency much better than TIPS, and they concluded that surgical shunting using HGPCS should have a greater role for decompressing portal hypertension.",

One disadvantage of the Hassab operation is that esophageal varices may occur because the Hassab procedure cannot block venous blood flow in the esophageal wall. However, in a recent study, this disadvantage was minimized by combining the Hassab operation with endoscopic sclerotherapy which has had satisfactory results.31,32 A significant merit of the Hassab operation compared with other interventions is that when combined with splenectomy, the development of thrombocytopenia can be avoided. It is known that after splenectomy, there is an elevation of platelet count.14 This expected rise in platelet count may be of great benefit to the surgeon, especially in the event that the patient needs further surgical intervention, for example in the case of hepatoma with liver cirrhosis. Hassab\u2019s operation can preserve portal blood flow, which produces lower incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. This surgical intervention should be considered to be one of the safest techniques currently in use for these cases.",
