All cases were referred after the confirmation of MERS-CoV infection and were admitted to negative pressure isolation rooms. The level of personal protective equipment for HCP was determined on the basis of the expected level of contact with patients. In general, HCP wore gloves, a fluid-resistant coverall, either protective glasses or a face shield, and an N95 respirator. During aerosol-generating procedures or when caring for patients under mechanical ventilator care, HCP wore inner and outer gloves, an impermeable coverall, a powered air-purifying respirator with external belt-mounted blower, full face shield (hood), inner and outer boot covers, and an apron.",

Although there was no visible breakage in the exposed skin area, he was quarantined because the exposed skin area was as large as 25 cm2. Case 2 reentered the isolation room while she was doffing in the anteroom and contacted the MERS patient for approximately 5 minutes without adequate respirator protection. Case 3 accidentally entered the isolation room with a disconnected circuit of the powered air-purifying respirator for approximately 10 minutes. Case 4 experienced disconnection of the circuit of the powered air-purifying respirator during the endotracheal intubation procedure and exposure time was estimated as approximately 30 seconds. The patients to whom cases 1 and 4 were exposed presented active pneumonia with sputum positive for MERS by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction at the time of exposure. No data are available to determine whether the patient was viremic in case 1 (whose skin was exposed to the blood of a patient). In the other cases, pneumonia was improving and the results of sputum testing for MERS by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction were equivocal or negative at the moment of exposure. All of the involved HCP were quarantined for 14 days and none of them developed MERS-like symptoms.\n",

Actually, 7 HCP contracted MERS at a different single institution in South Korea during the care of patients with known status of MERS infection\n8\n whereas there was no seroconversion case among the 443 HCP with adequate personal protective equipment during the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea.\n9\n\n",
