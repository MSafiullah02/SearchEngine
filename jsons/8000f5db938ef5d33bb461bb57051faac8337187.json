As of March, 21, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020, a total of 266, 073 confirmed cases from 150 countries and territories were reported, including 11,183 deaths (WHO, 2020b) . The COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical severity ranged from asymptomatic to critical pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death . Therefore, full monitoring the severity of COVID-19 and effective early intervention are the fundamental measures for reducing mortality.",

These cytokines and chemokines then attracted immune cells and activated immune responses, leading to cytokine storms and aggravations (Xu et al., 2020) . Several inflammatory markers have some tracing and detecting accuracy for disease severity and fatality . Inflammatory markers such as procalcitonin (PCT), serum ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been reported to be significantly associated with the high-risks of the development of severe COVID-19 (Cheng et al., 2020 , Gao et al., 2020 . Moreover, increased levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) are shown to be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis and may serve as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease progression (Cheng et al., 2020 , Xiang et al., 2020 . However, these results remain controversial due to no observed difference in the levels of IL-6, SAA, ESR and CRP J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f by other studies .",

The diagnosis and severity classification of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program in China ( National Health Commission of China, 2020), which classified COVID-19 into four types including mild, moderate, severe, and critical pneumonia. In our meta-analysis, severe or critical COVID-19 patients were grouped into severe group, and mild or moderate COVID-19 patients were grouped into nonsevere group. If there were two or more studies from the same authors or institutions, only the study with the largest sample size was chosen.

Recent studies showed that IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could be secreted by the active pathogenic T cell upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. And also, CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocyte activated by GM-CSF could secret more IL-6 and other inflammatory factors (Zhou Yonggang et al., 2020) . According to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China, decreasing level of IL-6 indicates the deterioration of COVID-19. Our study firstly provided an evidence-based medicine evidence through meta-analysis. Moreover, the level of IL-6 could not be routinely detected in many hospitals of China, but some inflammatory markers such as CRP, PCT and ESR usually could be detected. Our study firstly put forward that besides IL-6, other inflammatory markers such as CRP, PCT and ESR were also positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19. These conclusions were consistent through sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment.",
