PLpro processes the amino-terminal end of the replicase polyprotein to release nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. In this study, we identified a 316 amino acid core catalytic domain for SARS-CoV PLpro that is active in trans-cleavage assays. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis of the SARS-CoV PLpro domain suggested that this protease may also have deubiquitinating activity because it is predicted to have structural similarity to a cellular deubiquitinase, HAUSP (herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific-protease). Using a purified preparation of the catalytic core domain in an in vitro assay, we demonstrate that PLpro has the ability to cleave ubiquitinated substrates. We also established a FRETbased assay to study the kinetics of proteolysis and deubiquitination by SARS-CoV PLpro. This characterization of a PLpro catalytic core will facilitate structural studies as well as high-throughput assays to identify antiviral compounds.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Proteolytic processing of the coronavirus replicase polyprotein by 3CLpro and the papain-like proteases is essential for the formation of the mature replicase complex. In light of its role in processing the amino-terminal end of the replicase polyprotein, PLpro is a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. To identify a catalytically active core domain for PLpro, we performed deletion analysis from the Cand N-terminii of a region of SARS-CoV nsp3, which we had previously shown to be proteolytic active. We generated four N-terminal, and four C-terminal constructs and tested them for proteolytic activity in a trans-cleavage assay. The region from amino acids 1541-1855 was the smallest fragment with proteolytic activity. 3 To identify the important features of this segment, we aligned the amino acid sequences of 15 papain-like protease domains from 8 different coronaviruses with that of SARS-CoV PLpro1541-1855. While there is only an 18-32% identity between the sequences, there are some important conserved features, including the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues (identified as C1651 and H1812 for SARS-CoV PLpro) 2 and a conserved Zn-binding finger, which has been shown to be important for proteolytic activity of HCoV-229E PLP1. 4 In addition, we identified an aspartic acid residue (D1826 in SARS-CoV PLpro), which is conserved amongst all the coronavirus papain-like proteases. We found that PLpro in which D1826 was replaced by an alanine had no detectable proteolytic activity in the cellular trans-cleavage assay, 3 indicating that this residue may play an important role in proteolytic activity. We predict that this residue forms a part of a catalytic triad with the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues, similar to the active sites of other papain-like proteases. 5 Ultimately, crystallographic data will be critical for a complete understanding of the coronavirus PLpro active site.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 744, "end": 745, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1271, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1561, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1819, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IDENTIFYING A PLpro CATALYTIC CORE DOMAIN"}, {"text": "Interestingly, an independent bioinformatics study predicted that SARS-CoV PLpro may have structural similarity to a cellular deubiquitinating enzyme, HAUSP (herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease). 6, 7 On the basis of this similarity in molecular architecture and the predicted specificity of PLpro for cleavage after a diglycine residue, Sulea and co-workers predicted that PLpro has deubiquitinating (DUB) activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 213, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 214, "end": 215, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DEUBIQUITINATING ACTIVITY OF SARS-CoV PLpro."}, {"text": "To test this prediction we used our experimentally determined catalytic core domain in an in vitro assay for deubiquitination. 7 Briefly, wild-type PLpro and mutated versions where C1651 or D1826 was replaced by alanine, were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified to homogeneity. 3 In the assay, purified WT PLpro was incubated alone (Fig. 1 , lane 2) or with di-ubiquitin substrate (Boston Biochem) (lane 3) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in a buffer containing BSA.
