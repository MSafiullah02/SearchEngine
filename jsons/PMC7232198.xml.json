Since then, outbreaks and sporadic human infections have resulted in more than 80,000 laboratory confirmed cases (update on March 23, 2020) across mainland China. Through the analysis of sequence, this unidentified pneumonia was considered to be caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) named 2019-nCoV [2]. Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a standard format of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), according to its nomenclature, for this novel coronavirus pneumonia on February 11, 2020 [3]. On the same day, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named this novel coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2 [4]. So far, the SARS-CoV-2 infection is still spreading, and this virus poses a serious threat to public health, though joint prevention and quarantine mechanisms in almost all provinces of mainland China have been confirmed to be enacted. Due to a lack of specific antiviral treatments and pressure of clinical treatment, thousands of severe cases have died every day worldwide. In this review, we discuss the virology, clinical and molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutics for treatment of this infection.",

Based on clinical manifestations, blood tests, and chest radiographs, this disease was diagnosed as virus-induced pneumonia by clinicians. Initial epidemiological investigation suggested that a majority of suspected cases were associated with their presence (exposure) in a local Huanan seafood market. Notably, not just seafood, but many kinds of live wild animals were available for sale in this market all year round before it was forced to close on January 1, 2020. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated in environmental samples of the Huanan Seafood Market by China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), implying the origin of the outbreak. However, such a decisive conclusion was disputed because the earliest case had had no reported link connection to the mentioned market [5]. In addition, it was found that at least two different strains of SARS-CoV-2 had occurred a few months earlier before COVID-19 was officially reported [6]. A recently phyloepidemiologic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 at the Huanan Seafood Market could have been imported from other places [7]. To date, it remains inconsistent with regard to the origin of SARS-CoV-2, and epidemiologic and etiologic investigations are being conducted by Chinese health authorities.",

After sequence and evolutionary tree analysis, SARS-CoV-2 was considered as a member of \u03b2-CoVs [2,8]. The CoVs family is a class of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural roots. These viruses can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases [9,10]. The CoVs are genotypically and serologically divided into four subfamilies: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4-CoVs. Human CoV infections are caused by \u03b1- and \u03b2-CoVs [9,10]. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are members of \u03b2-CoVs [9]. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% and 50% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [2,8,11]. However, there is 94.6% sequence identity between the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [8], and less than 90% sequence identity between those of SARS-CoV-2 and other \u03b2-CoVs [2], implying that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the lineage B (Sarbecovirus) of \u03b2-CoVs [12].",

The nucleocapsid is buried inside phospholipid bilayers and covered by two different types of spike proteins: the spike glycoprotein trimmer (S) that exists in all CoVs, and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) only shared among some CoVs. The membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein are located among the S proteins in the viral envelope [12]. The SARS-CoV-2 genome has 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal sequences (265 nt at the 5\u2032 terminal and 229 nt at the 3\u2032 terminal region), which is typical of \u03b2-CoVs, with a gene order 5\u2032-replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N-3\u2032 (Figure 2B). The predicted S, ORF3a, E, M, and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 are 3822, 828, 228, 669, and 1260 nt in length, respectively.

In addition to cleavage of angiotensin (Ang) I to produce Ang-(1-9), ACE2 also provides a direct binding site for the S proteins of CoVs [17]. The S protein of CoVs exists in a metastable pre-fusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane [10]. This process is triggered by the S1 subunit and a host\u2013cell receptor binding, which destabilizes the pre-fusion trimer, resulting in the S1 subunit shedding and the S2 subunit transition to a highly stable post-fusion conformation [10]. To engage a host\u2013cell receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational movements that transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding [18]. In order to figure out the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its S protein, which is in contact with ACE2, was analyzed. The biophysical and structural evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 S protein likely binds to human ACE2 with 10\u201320 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV [19]. Another structural evidence suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously [20].",

A recent study indicates that 120 substitution sites were evenly distributed in eight coding regions, without evident recombination events [7]. However, Tang et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 had evolved into two major types of L and S, based on analyses of 103 genomes. Due to severe selective pressure on the L type, the L type might be more aggressive and spread more quickly, while the S type might remain milder due to relatively weaker selective pressure [26]. Due to the unstable nature of RNA viruses, the continuous surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 from humans or animals is extremely important for disease control.",

Primary viral replication is presumed to occur in mucosal epithelium of upper respiratory tract (nasal cavity and pharynx), with further multiplication in lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal mucosa [50], giving rise to a mild viremia. Few infections are controlled at this point and remain asymptomatic. Some patients have also exhibited non-respiratory symptoms such as acute liver and heart injury, kidney failure, diarrhea [5,51,52,53], implying multiple organ involvement. ACE2 is broadly expressed in nasal mucosa, bronchus, lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, stomach, bladder, and ileum, and these human organs are all vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 [40]. Recently, potential pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 to testicular tissues hasalso been proposed by clinicians, implying fertility concerns in young patients [54].

The left lung tissue displayed pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation, suggestive of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, could be observed in both lungs. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterized by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intra-alveolar spaces, indicating viral cytopathic-like changes. These pulmonary pathological findings extremely resemble those seen in SARS [56] and MERS [57]. Moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were observed in liver biopsy specimens, which might be caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug use. In addition, only a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were found in the heart tissue, which means that SARS-CoV-2 might not directly impair the heart [55]. Massive mucus secretion in both lungs was found in death cases with COVID-19, which was different from SARS and MERS [58].",

In fatal cases of human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, individuals exhibit severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, and the histopathology findings also support ARDS [55,56,57]. Previous studies have found that genetic susceptibility, and inflammatory cytokines were closely related to the occurrence of ARDS. More than 40 candidate genes including ACE2, interleukin 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) among others have been considered to be associated with the development or outcome of ARDS [60]. Increased levels of plasma IL-6 and IL-8 were also demonstrated to be related to adverse outcomes of ARDS [59]. The above biomarkers suggest both a molecular explanation for the severe ARDS and a possible treatment for ARDS followingSARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Clinical findings showed exuberant inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection, further resulting in uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation, likely a leading cause of case fatality. Rapid viral replication and cellular damage, virus-induced ACE2 downregulation and shedding, and antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) are responsible for aggressive inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2, as concluded in a recently published review article [61]. SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the same entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV for infection, suggesting the likelihood of the same population of cells being targeted and infected [62]. The initial onset of rapid viral replication may cause massive epithelial and endothelial cell death and vascular leakage, triggering the production of exuberant pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [63]. Loss of pulmonary ACE2 function has been proposed to be related to acute lung injury [64] because ACE2 downregulation and shedding can lead to dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and further enhance inflammation and cause vascular permeability. For SARS-CoV, one confusing issueis that only a few patients, particularly those who produce neutralizing antibodies early, experience persistent inflammation, ARDS, and even sudden death, while most patients survive the inflammatory responses and clear the virus [61]. The above phenomenon also exists in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A possible underlying mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been proposed recently [61]. ADE, a well-known virology phenomenon, has been confirmed in multiple viral infections [65]. ADE can promote viral cellular uptake of infectious virus\u2013antibody complexes following their interaction with Fc receptors (FcR), Fc\u03b3R, or other receptors, resulting in enhanced infection of target cells [65]. The interaction of Fc\u03b3R with the virus-anti-S protein-neutralizing antibodies (anti-S-IgG) complex may facilitate both inflammatory responses and persistent viral replication in the lungs of patients [61].",

The most common factors behind COVID-19 mortality are older age and concomitant disease. The limited understanding about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection indicates that COVID-19 and SARS have similar pathogenesis, and also have differences such as massive mucus secretion in both lungs of critical patient. There are still no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines available.
