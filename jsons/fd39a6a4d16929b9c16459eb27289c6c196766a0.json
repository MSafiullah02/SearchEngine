Such shortages as exemplified by sedatives may apply to a host of other drugs including antibiotics and vasopressors.

The usual supply chains, mechanisms, and administrative processes are inadequate for this crisis. We need to act now with urgency. Here are the steps that we as a nation must take. First, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must revamp its regulatory procedures and dramatically accelerate its processes to ensure that important medications are available to the public. Many of the drug shortages are going to be generic drugs. Due to various barriers, for some generic drugs we have only one or two FDA approved versions that are available for sale in the United States. In contrast, in some countries in Europe, and in India, each brand name drug may have multiple generic versions made by different manufacturers. The multiplicity of manufacturers acts as a protection against shortages in these countries, and also lowers cost. 8 We recommend that the FDA institute a 24-hour turnaround for approving the importation of generic drugs that are in short supply from established manufacturers in other countries. Alternatively, the FDA can also grant immediate reciprocal approval for selected generic drugs manufactured in other countries. 9 Not having access to a drug must be considered far worse for the public the agency is charged to protect than any safety concerns that arise with the use of a generic drug that is made by an established manufacturer hitherto not authorized to sell in the United States.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 940, "end": 941, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1251, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "April 2, 2020 Medication Shortages and COVID-19", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mayo Clinic Proceedings"}, {"text": "Page 4", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mayo Clinic Proceedings"}, {"text": "Second, the federal government must work with major brand name and generic pharmaceutical companies to boost mass manufacturing of approved drugs that are in short supply. If General Motors can repurpose its factories to make ventilators, then big pharmaceutical companies can be requested to divert their factories to manufacture generic drugs that are facing shortages. If companies that have the infrastructure are not willing to do this voluntarily, in the national interest, then the administration must invoke the Defense Production Act to compel them to meet the needs of the country.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mayo Clinic Proceedings"}, {"text": "Third, we need to encourage and fund non-profit generic drug manufacturing in the United States. Civica Rx, for instance, was founded with the goal of overcoming drug shortages and to manufacture and supply at reduced cost. This concept needs to be expanded. Although it will take time to set up, government manufacturing of essential drugs is something we have to consider longterm because generic drugs with small profit margins are unattractive to for-profit companies despite critical need.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mayo Clinic Proceedings"}, {"text": "Fourth, most APIs (the active chemical substance in prescription drugs) are currently manufactured in China. 10 Recommendations to control cost: Even as we increase the amounts of available drugs, we must take steps to keep costs down. As we have witnessed with hand sanitizers and masks, if supplies are limited, prices go up dramatically. In the case of prescription drugs, we already have major problems controlling price, even prior to this pandemic. 13 If we fail to take strict measures, access to life saving medications will be limited by cost, and this will disproportionately affect uninsured people and the elderly-the ones most vulnerable to COVID-19.

We also recommend that laws be enacted to immediately authorize Medicare to negotiate price for COVID-19 related drugs. There has always been overwhelming public support for Medicare negotiation, and this is something we must do now more than ever because it can help keep prices lower. 15 As a last resort, the federal government should be willing to issue compulsory licensing, if negotiations with companies fail to reach agreement on a reasonable price. 16 2001, allows governments to license the use of a patented invention to a third party or government agency without the consent of the patent-holder if negotiations with the patent owner are unsuccessful. 17 Another major factor that can increase the prices of COVID-19 related drugs in the United States are pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who normally act as middlemen between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and insurers. PBMs are supposed to deliver value to insurers and the insured public by identifying the best options for formulary placement and negotiating for lower prices. However, this is not always the case. PBMs may favor expensive drugs over inexpensive alternatives, and best illustrated by insulin prices that steadily contribute to increases in the list prices of even older insulin preparations. 13 The resulting higher retail prices disproportionately affect the uninsured and under-insured public. To prevent these problems, the federal government must prohibit deductibles and rebates for COVID-19 specific drugs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 576, "end": 578, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 747, "end": 749, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 953, "end": 955, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1568, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mayo Clinic Proceedings"}, {"text": "Like many at-risk resources in this crisis, medication shortages have been invisible but are threatening not only our ability to overcome this pandemic, but also the health of patients who have other diseases.
