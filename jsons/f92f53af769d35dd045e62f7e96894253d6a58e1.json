An intensive data and sample collection will be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months (5 times in total) with a final follow-up 1 year after the participants' inclusion in the study. At each collection time-point, blood, nasal and oropharyngeal swabs are collected, and participants also fill in questionnaires on epidemiological and clinical data as well as socioeconomic and psychological well-being. The provision of a stool sample at each biosampling time point is optional for all participants.

Low levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, as shown by the high Ct values (Table 4) , were confirmed for 5/6 participants after retesting by additional rRT-PCRs (Figure 3) . Despite the very low viral RNA concentrations, the repeated viral RNA detection combined with the serological response observed strongly suggested that these five participants had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apparently, they were in the phase of clearing the viral infection and mounting an antibody response.

The combination of retesting by additional rRT-PCRs (Figure 3 ) as well as assessment of IgA and IgG serology, however, strongly suggest that 5 of these 6 study participants were true SARS-CoV-2 positive cases with residual low viral loads and seroconversion. This is also further evidenced by one of the participants who already tested positive 25 days prior to enrolment (participant 3, see Table  4 ). Duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding appears to vary widely between patients. Detection of viral RNA for 2-3 weeks after symptom onset is frequent (Kujawski et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) , even in seroconverted patients, and extended viral shedding for up to 83 days was reported (Li et al., 2020). One of the study participants (participant 5, Table 4 ) was not confirmed positive after two confirmation rRT-PCR assays and did not show seroconversion until now. This patient might have been recruited at the onset of viral shedding in contrast to the other cases and/or may not mount an immune response as sometimes observed in asymptomatic patients. Longitudinal follow-up sampling as implemented in the design of our study will allow us to clarify the status of this participant at a later stage.",

Nevertheless, cross-reactivity in ELISA due to past exposure to other hCoV likely partially accounts for the observed lower specificity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA ELISA used in our study. Notably, cross-reactivity in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG ELISAs has been documented in patients with specific seroconversion against hCoV-OC43, while baseline sera were negative (Okba et al., 2020) . In Germany, the follow up of a birth cohort revealed that 19/25 (76.0%) newborns had seroconverted by 21 months of age (Dijkman et al., 2012) . While the frequency of each of the four seasonal hCoV oscillates between years and regions, hCoV-OC43 (betaCoV) is usually more frequent, in patients with acute respiratory disease, especially compared to hCoV-229E (alphaCoV) (Dijkman et al., 2012; Heimdal et al., 2019; Monto et al., 2020) . Aside from a lower assay specificity, discrepancies between IgA and IgG responses may also arise from sequential immune response. IgA tends to appear earlier than IgG after symptom onset (Guo et al., 2020) , and may explain why some participants have detectable levels of IgA but no IgG. All rights reserved.

However, in a fraction of patients, the disease evolves to fever and cough with or without respiratory distress and in some cases, a hospitalisation with therapy by inhaled oxygen and further medical support is needed.
