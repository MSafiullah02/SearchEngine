To prevent the spread of COVID-19, most countries have adopted social distancing policies and closed all non-essential businesses. However, this strategy has resulted in several economic repercussions.

The death rate for older adults (60+) is 6 .4% and increases up to 13.4% for more senior older adults (80+) whereas the death rate for young healthy adults is less than 1% (1) . Given that Brazil has a large percentage of its population over the age of 60 years, especially in the urban areas of the South and Southeastern regions, the incidence of aggravated cases may be particularly high in comparison to countries with younger population demographics (3) . It has also been debated whether environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) influence the behavior of the COVID-19 virus similar to the common cold and flu. Yet, the majority of the research investigating the virus has been conducted in environments different/opposite than that of Brazil and other countries in the southern hemisphere (4, 5) . In addition, Brazil faces many economical and sociocultural challenges that may impact containment, mitigation, and suppression strategies differently than countries that are the current focus of most prediction models (3) .",

However, laboratory testing to confirm exposure and/or diagnosis has been a major obstacle for the containment, mitigation, and suppression of COVID-19 worldwide. The actual number of people who have been infected with COVID-19 is unknown. What is known is the number of people who have lab-confirmed cases, which is dependent upon the number of people being tested and how the results are reported. Some countries are testing a higher percentage of the population (e.g., Iceland) and have more comprehensive reporting practices (e.g., Estonia) than others (8) (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing). In Brazil, the testing rates have been significantly lower (1375/million) than countries with higher per capita income such as the United Kingdom (7.886/million), United States (12.407/million), Germany (20.629/million) and France (7.103/million) (https://www.worldbank.org/) and has been limited to individuals with severe, life-threatening symptoms (https://covid.saude.gov.br/).",

More specifically, mortality rates may rise as hospitals become overwhelmed and have fewer resources. As such, the ability to accurately estimate the need for hospital beds and Intensive Care Units (ICU), for example, may be an important factor in combating COVID-19. For example, in a recent model forecasting the need for hospital beds based upon age and infection mortality rates (IFR), it was assumed the 30% hospitalized cases would need to be placed in a ICU (50% of which were predicted not to survive) and with average hospital stays estimated at 16 days (9). In addition, research has indicated the availability of adequate medical assistance was highly correlated to the income status of countries (10). Unfortunately, in countries first impacted by the pandemic the demand for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators surpassed the local availability even in countries with high per capital income. In countries with a shortfall of health infrastructure and services, the COVID-19 pandemic may have even more dire consequences.",

As such we multiplied the number of cases in Brazil by a correction factor. To determine this factor, we took two information into consideration the death rate in Iceland, the country with the greatest percentage of test per habitant in the time of this analyses (15) (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and each countries percentage of people over 65% years considering the increase in death rate with age (1). First, we found a linear regression fit of the death rate and the percentage of people in each country over 65 years of age for the 21 countries from which data was gathered. The linear equation found was y=0.004x+0.01. Using this equation, we corrected Brazil's death rate and determined the correction factor by diving Brazil's corrected death rate by Iceland's corrected death rate.",

The lack of widespread testing and comprehensive epidemiological investigations have been major issues for many countries, including Brazil. When testing is limited to those with severe, life-threatening symptoms, mortality rates are likely inflated. With more testing people with mild symptoms are identified, resulting in lower mortality rates. Countries with higher testing rates most likely provide a more accurate representation. Iceland, recognized as testing a larger percentage of the population (10%) than any other country, has a reported mortality rate at approximates 0.6% (15) . Thus, in our model, we used data from Iceland to correct the number of total cases of Brazil and S\u00e3o Paulo and account for a lack of testing.",

For countries with older population demographics, mortality rates may be particularly high. As such, we applied a correction in the confirmed cases to our model, correcting by the age of the population.

The results indicated that the model accurately fit both accumulated death data and corrected accumulated case data for both Brazil and S\u00e3o Paulo (Figure 2). Our model predicted a basic reproduction number R0 for Brazil of 3.82 and Sao Paulo 3.52. The basic reproduction number represents the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single infectious case in a susceptible population (20). Considering the importance of such parameter, several investigations have used various methods to estimate this parameter for COVID-19 and our values fall within the range of values reported so far. In their review, Liu et al. (2020) reported two studies using stochastic methods that estimated R0 ranging from 2.2 to 2.68, six studies using mathematical computation methods with results ranging of 1.5 to 6.49, and three studies using statistical methods such as exponential growth with estimations ranging from 2.2 to 3.58. Additionally, we found latent periods of 0.3 and 0.5 days and infectious period of approximately 8 days for Brazil and S\u00e3o Paulo, respectively. The mean estimated latent period found here is smaller than some previously reported, such as in PENG et al (2020) and GUAN et al (2020) (21) who estimates the latent median times around 2-3 days.",

As such, when to reopen economies has become a hotly debated issue worldwide.Opening the economy too soon may result in greater cost to human life while continued closure may result in economic crisis (24). Therefore, knowing when and how to reopen economies is of utmost important. Since we already have a scheduled date for the process of re-opening in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, and possibly the rest of the country as well, we used this date in our simulation. Simulations produced by our model, indicated the capacity of public health care resources (ICU beds) in Brazil was not great enough to sustain the projected infection rates if social distancing measures were lifted too soon. However, projections also indicated values for social distancing and protection that can help yield a safe return post quarantine.",
