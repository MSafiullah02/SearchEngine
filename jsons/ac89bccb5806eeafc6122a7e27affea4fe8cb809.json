Moreover, 5.9 million children died in 2015 before reaching the fifth year of their life and most of these death were due to infection (i.e., diarrhea, malaria, birth asphyxia, pneumonia etc.); however, this number can be reduced to half at least by treating or preventing through the access to simple affordable interventions [2] . Core problem in healthcare sector is to overcome the huge number of causalities as well as reduce the cost. The goal is to reduce the prevalence of disease, help people to live longer and healthier life as well as reduce the cost. One of the main interests in disease prevention is driven by the need to reduce the cost. The lifetime medical expenditures are increased from $ 14k to $ 83k per person and this increase is up to 160K after the age of 65. Thus, the proportion of average world GDP devoted to healthcare sector is increased from 5.28% in 1995 to 5.99% in 2014 and is expected to increase in future (i.e., from 17.1% in 2014 to 19.9 of US GDP by 2022%) [3, 4] . This increase in medical expenditures is mainly due to the aging and growing populations, the rising prevalence of chronic diseases as well as for infrastructure improvement. Thus, the cost-saving and cost-effective preventive solutions are required to reduce the burden on economy. Traditional preventive measures mainly focus on promotion of healthcare benefits. The cost-effectiveness ratio is said to be unfavorable when intervention incremental cost are larges relative to the healthcare benefits. USA spent 90% of budget on disease treatment and their complication rather than prevention (only 2-3%) whereas many of these diseases can be prevented at first stage [5, 6] . Spending more on health does not guarantee of health system efficiency. The investment on prevention can help to reduce the cost as well as improve the health quality and efficiency. Health industry is facing considerable challenges in the promotion and protection of health at a time when there is huge pressure due to the considerable budgets constraints and resources in many countries. Early detection and prevention of disease plays a very important role in reducing deaths as well as healthcare cost.

An effective disease management strategy reduces the risks from disease, slow down its progression and reduces symptoms. It is the most efficient and affordable way to reduce the risk of disease. Preventive measures strategies are divided into different stages, e.g., primary, secondary and tertiary. Disease prevention can be applied at any prevention level along with the disease history, with the goal of preventing its progression further. Primary It seeks to reduce the occurrence of new cases, e.g., stress management, exercises, smoking cessation to prevent lung cancer and immunization against communicable diseases. Thus, it is most applicable at the suspected stage of a patient. Strategies of primary prevention include risk factor reduction, general health promotion and other protective measure. This can be done by bringing up the healthier lifestyles and environmental health approaches through health education and promotion program. Secondary Purpose of secondary prevention is to either cure the disease, slow down its progression, or reduce its impact and is the most appropriate for those in the stage of earlystage or pre-symptomatic disease. It attempts to reduce the number of cases through early detection of the disease and reducing or halting its progression, e.g., detection of coronary heart patient after their first heart attack, blood tests for lead exposure, eye tests for glaucoma, lifestyle and dietary modification. Common approach to secondary prevention includes procedure to detect and treat preclinical pathological changes early through screening for disease, e.g., mammography for early-stage breast cancer detection. Tertiary The key aim of tertiary disease prevention is to enhance life quality of patient. Once the disease is firmly established and has been treated in its acute clinical phase, it seeks to soften the impact of disease on the patient through therapy and rehabilitation, e.g., tight control of type-1 diabetes, assisting a cardiac patient to lose weight and improving the functioning of stroke patient through rehabilitation program.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concept and traditional methodology"}, {"text": "Effective primary prevention to avert new cases, secondary prevention for early detection and treatment and tertiary prevention for better diseases management are not only to improve the quality of life but also helps to reduce unnecessary healthcare initialization.

Data mining provides great benefits for the disease identification and HDFS enables the underlying storage for the Hadoop cluster and enhances healthcare data analytics system by dividing large amount of data into smaller one and distributed it across various servers/nodes treatment; however, there are several limitations and challenges involved in adapting DM analysis techniques. Successful prevention depends upon knowledge of disease causation, transmission dynamics, risk factor and group identification, early detection and treatment methods, implementation of these methods and continuous evaluation and development of prevention and treatment methods. Additionally, data accessibility (data integration) and constraints(missing, unstructured, corrupted, non-standardized data and noisy) add more challenges. Due to the huge number of patients, it is impossible to consider all those parameters to develop cost-effective and cost-efficient prevention system. The expansion of medical records databases and increased linkage between physician, patient and health record led the researcher to develop efficient prevention system. Healthcare applications generate mound of complex data. To transform this data into information for decision making, traditional approaches are lagging behind, and they barely adopt advanced information technologies, such as data mining, data analytics, big data etc. Tremendous advancement in hardware, software and communication technologies opens up opportunities for innovative prevention by provided cost-saving and cost-effective solution by improving the health outcomes, properly analyzing the risk and overcoming the duplicate efforts.

Healthcare data is diverse and have different format. Moreover, with the rapid use of wearable sensors in healthcare results in tremendous increase in the size of heterogeneous data.

Conventional wisdom is that larger corpora yield better predicting accuracy however data redundancy and irrelevancy introduces bias rather than benefits that distorts learned models. Thus, before applying any prediction model, dataset needs to be processed carefully by removing the redundant data (e.g., age, DOB, redundant lab reports) as well irrelevant data (e.g., gender attribute in case of gestational diabetes). However, little is known about the redundancy that exists in the data as well as what type of redundancy is beneficial as opposed to harmful. Statistical methods (correlation analysis etc) could be used to identify irrelevant variables, other alternative is feature selection based on the importance of specific variable. To deal with missing values, it is recommended to use data analysis methods that are robust to missingness that are good to use when we are confident that mild to moderate violations of the technique's key assumptions will produce little or may be no biasness in the resultant conclusions.

Unlike partition, it does not assume a particular value of k. First step in hierarchical clustering is to look the most similar/closet pair which are then joined to make clustering tree. Division or merging of cluster is performed on the similarity measure that is based on optimal criteria. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types agglomerative and divisive also known as bottom-up and top-down respectively. Divisive clustering starts with single cluster containing all observation and consider all possible way to split into appropriate sub-clusters recursively, whereas agglomerative starts with one point cluster and recursively merges two or more clusters into a new cluster in bottom-up fashion. Main disadvantages of the hierarchical methods are inability to scale and no backtracking capability. Standard hierarchical approaches suffer from high computational complexity. Typical hierarchical clustering includes BIRCH, CURE and ROCK etc. To improve the performance, several approaches have been presented. In fuzzy based clustering also called soft clustering, where each data point can belong to more than one cluster. It is continuous interval [0, 1] of belonging label, 0, 1 is being used instead of discrete value in order to describe relationship more reasonably.

It is quite challenging to develop generic framework for anomaly detection due to unavailability of labeled data and domain specific normality; thus, most of the anomaly detection methods have been developed for certain domain [90] . It is an important problem and has a significant impact on the efficiency of any data mining system. The importance of its detection is due to the fact that its presence in data can compromise data quality and reduce the effectiveness of learning algorithm. Thus, it is a very critical problem and requires high degree of accuracy. Anomaly detection is the detection of items, events or observations in the data that do not conform to an expected pattern [91] . Broadly speaking, based on their nature, anomalies can be classified into four categories are point (individual data instance is considered as anomalous with respect to the rest of data), contextual (data instance is anomalous in a specific context), collective anomalies (collection of related data instances is anomalous with respect to the rest of dataset).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 339, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 569, "end": 573, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1035, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Anomaly detection"}, {"text": "Based on the available data labels, three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist: unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection. As availability of labeled dataset for anomaly detection is not easily possible; thus, most of the approaches are based on unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods where the purpose is to find the abnormal behavior. Supervised learning-based methods uses fully labeled data, semi-supervised anomaly detection uses anomaly-free dataset for training and find anomaly if it deviated from trained dataset whereas unsupervised detection method uses intrinsic information to detect anomalous values based on the deviation form majority of data. Why the supervised learning methods is not that successful for anomaly detection? First of all, not all supervised classification method suits for this task, i.e., C4.5 cannot be applied to unbalanced data [92] . Secondly, anomalies are abnormal behavior and they might not have known prior. Semi-supervised is one-class (normal data)-based method that is trained on normal data without anomalies and after that deviations from that data are considered anomalies. Unsupervised is the commonly used method for anomalies detection and it does not require data labeling. Distance or densities are used to estimates the abnormalities based on intrinsic properties of the dataset.

Several methods for anomaly detection have been presented in literature, some of most popular anomaly detection are SVM, Replicator neural networks, correlation-based detection, density-based techniques (k-nearest neighbor, local outlier factor), deviations from association rules and ensemble techniques (using feature bagging or score normalization). Output of anomaly detection system could be score or label [93] . Score (commonly used for unsupervised or semi-supervised) is a ranked list of anomalies that are assigned to each instance depending on the degree to which instance is considered anomaly whereas labeling (used for supervised) are binary output (anomaly or not) (Fig. 5) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 760, "end": 768, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Anomaly detection"}, {"text": "k-NN (not k-nearest neighbor classification)-based unsupervised anomaly detection is a straightforward way for anomaly detection. It is not able to detect local anomalies and only detect global anomalies. Anomaly score is computed on k-nearest-neighbors distance (computed either single (known as kth-NN) [94] or average (known as k-NN) [95] ). Outlier Factor Local outlier factor is well know method for finding anomalous data points by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighboring point. LOF works in three steps: k-NN is applied to all data points; estimation of local Neural Computing and Applications density using local readability density; and finally computation of LOF score through LRD comparison with its neighbor LRD. In fact LOF is the ratio of local density. Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor (COF) is based on the spherical density computation rather than k-NN-based selection. Unlike LOF and COF, Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF) performs density estimation for clusters. First, clustering is performed to find clusters and then anomaly score is calculated based on the distance of each data point with cluster center. LDCOF (local density cluster-based outlier factor) is the extension of CBLOF that considers the density of local cluster as well by segmenting into small and large clusters. LDCOF (local density cluster-based outlier factor) is the extension of LDLOF to overcome the shortcoming of CBLOF and unweighted-CBLOF by estimating the clusters densities assuming a spherical distribution of the cluster members. LDCOF is local score as it is based on distance of instance to its cluster center. LOF and COF output are scores, but they do not determine the threshold. Outlier Probability resolves this issue. Clustering-based Multivariate Gaussian Outlier Score (CMGOS) is another extension of cluster-based anomaly detection. First, k-means clustering is performed followed by computation of covariance matrix. Local estimation is calculated by estimating a multivariate Gaussian model and Mahalanobis distance is used for distance computation. Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS) is unsupervised, anomaly detection method [96] . It is fast than multivariate approach due to independence of features. For each feature, histogram is computed followed by multiplication of inverse height of the bins it resides for each instance.

Successful approaches need to use a range of techniques to deal with real-world problem especially when data is quite large and complicated. During recent years, a large number of methods have been presented for anomaly detection, selection of method depends upon the type of anomaly and data itself. Before selecting a method, it is important to know which anomaly detection technique is best suited for a given anomaly detection problem and data. When dimensions are high in number, NN and clustering-based methods are not good option as the distance measures in high number of dimensions are not able to differentiate between anomalous and normal data. To deal with high-dimensional data, spectral techniques could be used as they explicitly address high dimensionality issue through high to low dimensional projection mapping. If fully labeled or partially-labeled data is available then supervised-or semi-supervised-based method could be used even in case of high-dimensional data. Semi-supervised method are preferable over supervised methods as supervised methods are poor to deal distribution imbalance of labels (normal vs specific anomaly) thus data need to be preprocessed to overcome this biasness issue. Due to the sensitivity of healthcare finding, one main challenge is to find best feature vector that provide maximum discrimination power and avoid false positive to minimum and has high accuracy. Thus, it is required to find efficient feature vector that characterizes the anomalous occurrence and its location causing agent in time or frequency domain using some domain transformation or wavelets. Another issue that should be considered is computational complexity as anomaly detection methods have high computational complexity especially when dealing with real-time data, i.e., data generated by ICU monitoring sensors. Most of the anomaly detection methods are unsupervised or semi-supervised and these techniques require expensive testing phases which can limit it in real setting. To overcome this issue, one should consider model size and its complexity. Another big challenge that effects the performance of anomaly detection method is data itself.

Despite the rapid increase in EHR adoption, there are several challenges around making that information useful, readable and relevant to the physicians and patients who need it most. One of the key challenges in healthcare industry is how to manage, store and exchange all of this data. Interoperability is considered as one of the solutions to this problem. Another challenge is data privacy that limits the sharing of data by blocking out significant patient identification information such as MRN, SSN. Most of the patients visit multiple clinics to try to find a reason for their disease. For example, if a patient visit clinic ''A'' for urgent care for heart attack and follow-up with his primary care physician at clinic ''B'' who further refer him to cardiologist at clinic ''C''. At each clinic, physician looks in depth, go for some test and prescribe some drugs.

Patient privacy and information security are fundamental components of well-functioning healthcare system that helps to achieve better health outcomes, smarter spending, and healthier people.

This kind of patient attitude put patient at risk and may deprive physician and researchers to go for important finding as well as put the organization at risk for clinical outcome and operational efficiency analysis. To reap the promise, providers and individuals must trust that an patient health information is private and secure, while on the other hand, providers are facing several challenges in the implementation of privacy and security at patient satisfaction level, i.e., efficient data analysis without providing access to precise data in specific patient records.

Security and privacy issues are magnified by data growth, non-standard, variety and diversity of sources such as different formats, multiple sources, nature of data etc. Thus, traditional data security which are actually to secure small scale data are inadequate and fails. Security and privacy is data analytics especially when it draws information from multiple sources poses several challenges. Privacy of patient data is both the technical issue as well as sociological, which must be addressed jointly from both technical and sociological perspectives. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is world wide accepted set of general requirements and security standards to protect the information in health sector. HIPAA provides the legal rights regarding personally identifiable sensitive patient information and their establish obligations for healthcare providers to protect the use by avoiding its misuse. With the exponential rise in healthcare data, remote monitoring and smart devices, researchers are facing the big challenges to anonymize the patients sensitive information in order to prevent its misuse or disclosure? i.e. discarding of patient sensitive personal information such information SSN(social security number) MRN (medical record number), name, age etc. makes it very complex and challenging to link the patient data up to unique individual. Even hiding such information, still hacker can easily identify some of patient sensitive information through association. The other way to hide patient sensitive information is the use of differential privacy that helps to restrict the data access to the organization based on their requirement. However, these privacy challenges are factors that, in fact leads to the situations where, data analytics researchers are facing the issue from both legal as well as ethical perspective. The main privacy challenges associated with healthcare data analytics, overrunning the privacy concerns of traditional data.

Due to the tremendous advancement in IT, wearable technology and other body sensors, increasingly, the data is quite large (moving to big data), unstructured (80% of electronic health data is unstructured), non-standard as well as in multimedia format. This variety in data makes it challenging and interesting for analysis. The quality of healthcare data is concerned for successful prevention system and is due to three main reasons, are incompleteness (missing data), inconsistency (data mismatch between within same or various EHR sources), inaccuracy (nonstandards, incorrect or imprecise data) and data fragmentation. Data quality is a group of different techniques that are data standardization, verification, validation, monitoring, profiling and matching. The biggest problem of poor data in health industry has reached at epidemic proportion and introduces several pernicious effects in particular disease prevention. The problem with dirty data are mostly related to missing value, duplication, outliers and stale records. Thus, the first thing before going to data analytics is to perform cleaning for high-quality data and void the analytics until the data is fully clean. Not all healthcare data is collected directly through sensors, large fraction of data is collected through data entry (i.e., patient history, symptoms, physician recommendation, Lab report data entry etc.) that is not prefect as automatics entry and introduces human error in data. Incomplete data and inaccurate data, can also lead to missed or spurious associations that can be wasteful or even harmful to patient care. The opportunities for data error are relatively limited and easily identified by algorithms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data quality and dataset"}, {"text": "Three million preventable adverse events result 98,000 deaths and extra 17 billion cost per year, whereas most of the causes of medical errors can be overcame by improving the device interoperability. Currently, one-third percent of the hospitals uses various devices (such as defibrillators, electrocardiographs, vital signs monitors, ventilators and infusion pumps) could be integrated with EHRs. This lack of auto data acquisition creates significant sources of waste and risk to patient. Because of incomplete or stale information, data analytics methods may not be reliable for decision making. The solutions to deal with interoperability is not easier as compared to missing and inaccurate data. Since last two decades, little success has been made. Currently, hardware industry lacks the imperative to offer interoperability as most of the hospital have to bear additional cost to integration.

Structuring of only 20 percent of data has shown its importance but on the other hand clinical notes are still in practice and created in billions due to the reason that the physician can best explain the clinical encounter. Empower physicians as well as maintaining the data quality is quite challenging. So far, this data is excluded from data analytics as its available in natural language and not discrete. Transforming this unstructured data into discreet form requires efficient intelligent technology and it is hard problem of medical IT until now. The only way we can use this unstructured and non-standard data by using NLP to translate that data using ICD or SNOMET CT into discrete data. Systrue system provides clinical NLP platform with advance intelligence techniques that allows the healthcare organizations to power up the content and data layer of their applications. AWARE (Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation) is a viewer and clinical decision support tool designed to reduce risk of error.

Real problem with dataset is the ground truth, it is more challenging when we are talking about big data and deep learning where we need really big dataset to train. It is very easy to get images of segregating men and women or cars images with different color and shapes however to annotate medical data, we need expert. Thus, expensive medical expertise is needed for high-quality annotation of medical data. Data privacy makes it more challenging as compared to other domain. Furthermore, annotation by single expert is not enough due to human error; thus, it is required to have consensus annotations by multiple expert observers.
