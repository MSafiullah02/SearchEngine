            "text": "Avian astroviruses comprise a diverse group of viruses affecting many avian species and causing enteritis, hepatitis, and nephritis. Reports of astroviruses as cause of illness in birds predate that of mammals. In 1965, a fatal hepatitis was described in ducklings [2] and was eventually shown to be caused by an astrovirus [22, 23]. Another astrovirus, avian nephritis virus (ANV), was first isolated in 1976 and was associated with growth depression and kidney lesions in young chickens. Initially classified as an Enterovirus, it was later reclassified as an astrovirus following the complete sequencing of the viral genome [30]. To date, six different astroviruses have been identified in avian species based on the species of origin and viral genome characteristics: two turkey-origin astroviruses [Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2)]; two chicken-origin astroviruses [ANV and Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV)]; and two duck-origin astrovirus [Duck Astrovirus type1 (DAstV-1) and type 2 (DAstV-2)]. ANV has also been detected in turkeys [18, 70], ducklings [6], pigeons [45, 116], and guinea fowl [8]; and TAstV-2-like viruses also have been found in guinea fowl [9, 10].",

Enteric diseases cause substantial economic losses in commercial poultry, and many enteric disease syndromes have been described including runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS), poult enteritis complex or syndrome (PEC or PES), and poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). Astroviruses are among the most common viruses found in cases of PEC, PES, and PEMS in turkeys [2, 3, 34\u201337, 42, 68, 69, 75, 76, 79, 81, 99]. Astroviruses have also been isolated from cases of RSS in broilers and have been previously associated with poor weight gain, enteric disease, and kidney disease in chickens [4, 15, 27, 83, 85, 86, 105], as well as in guinea fowl suffering from enteritis [10].",

A second type of astrovirus affecting chickens was shown to be antigenically and genetically distinct from ANV and was named chicken astrovirus (CastV, 4). CAstVs that share high levels of nucleotide sequence identity with this first characterized CAstV have been detected in the USA in broiler chickens affected with RSS [67]. Recently, molecular and antigenic characterization of enterovirus-like viruses (ELVs) demonstrated that they were CAstV, some of them closely related to the first characterized CAstV, and some of them more distantly related [102].",

It is known that ANV and TAstV-2 each comprise at least two serotypes but many more are suspected. Some studies have shown that TAstV-2, ANV, and CAstV display substantial levels of capsid protein sequence variability, possibly indicating that there are numerous serotypes of each virus [33, 71, 72, 88, 94, 104]. Concomitant infections with different strains have been reported for avian astroviruses and this can result in recombination between strains [71, 72, 94, 104]. Recombination is likely to provide an important mechanism by which the sequence diversity of avian astroviruses is increased.

In addition to these organizational differences, the TAstV-2-like viruses are the only members of Avastrovirus missing the conserved s2m RNA stem-loop motif [44, 94]. While not unprecedented, as the bat, rat, and MBL1 astroviruses are missing this motif [11, 12], its absence suggests this feature is not essential. The prevalence of the s2m motif among Astroviridae as well as other viruses led Monceyron et al. to propose that it was introduced into an astrovirus progenitor via a recombination event between non-related viruses [62]. The biological significance of the loss of s2m or the differences in the organization of the ORFs is unclear, but may reflect differences in evolutionary pressures.",

This discrepancy, however, is not unexpected as TAstV-1 has been classified as a member genogroup I (see Taxonomy) with the ANV-like viruses based on phylogenetic comparisons of the capsid genes [6]. The one non-ANV-like CAstV isolate included in this alignment, however, was found to group between genogroups I and II. At present, it is unclear if this represents a distinct genogroup or an evolutionary transition as it has some elements more consistent with genogroup I member TAstV-1 (genomic organization, Fig. 9.1) and others more consistent with genogroup II members TAstV-2 and DAstV (overall length and 5\u2032 UTR, Figs. 9.1 and 9.3).\n\n",

The conserved motif is even more prominent when viewed in the context of its predicted secondary structure (Fig. 9.3b). The conserved stem-loop structure has been proposed to function as a promoter element for RNA transcription [38, 107]. This idea is supported by the fact that a similar highly conserved sequence can be found immediately upstream of ORF2 in the area where RNA transcription of the subgenomic message would begin (Fig. 9.3c). The function of these elements has not been demonstrated experimentally in any astrovirus isolate; however, given their conservation within the genome as well as across Astroviridae this suggests a functional role.",

            "text": "The formation of another RNA structural element, the retrovirus-like frame shift stem-loop, has been a defining characteristic of Astroviridae [32]. The presence or absence of this structure, along with the other basic genomic organization, has been one of the items used in the classification of novel viruses to the family [20, 30, 39, 44]. The stem-loop formed has been described to play a key role in the translation of the ORF1b as part of the ORF1a polyprotein in human astrovirus infected cells [48\u201350, 55]. Experimental evidence demonstrated that the stem-loop formed allowed for a frame shift to occur upstream of the ORF1a stop-codon, and that brought ORF1b into frame with ORF1a resulting in the translation of one polyprotein [21, 49]. Based on this observation, it has been assumed that the presence of this structure in Avastrovirus genomes meant a similar mechanism allowed for the translation of the avian astrovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Recently, studies by Kang et al. have suggested that the avian astroviruses may not use this strategy [39]. Comparison of the stem-loop predicted for human astrovirus to that of the avian viruses demonstrates differences in their ability to induce the needed frame shift (Fig. 9.4). In human astrovirus, the loop structure is between the \u201cslippery sequence\u201d (AAAAAAC) and the ORF1a stop codon (Fig. 9.4). Conversely, in the avian astroviruses, the ORF1a stop codon is immediately downstream of the \u201cslippery sequence,\u201d and upstream of the stem loop structure (Fig. 9.4). Therefore, any frame shift induced may not allow for translation of ORF1a to read through to ORF1b. Kang et al. proposed that translation of ORF1b in the CAstV could initiate via a start codon just upstream of the \u201cslippery sequence\u201d [39]; however, this is the only avian virus to have a start site immediately upstream of the \u201cslippery sequence\u201d and would require the stem-loop structure not to be formed. Examination of these viruses for other alternative start sites revealed the first ATG in ORF1b was between 68 and 257 nt downstream from the ORF1a stop codon (Fig. 9.4). It is possible that a more complex stem-loop and frame shift structure is produced in these viruses that allows for the translation of ORF1a\u20131b or, as proposed by Kang et al., perhaps the avian astroviruses use a different strategy for the translation of their RdRp [39].\n",

Analysis of the human astroviruses indicate that the more conserved region of the capsid is important in virion assembly while the more variable region is found on the outer surface of the virion and is involved in interacting with cellular receptors and the immune system [46]. This suggests that these different regions of the capsid protein are under different evolutionary pressures. The first approximately 400 residues are important for encapsidation of the viral RNA and formation of the virion. As such, there are strong structural constraints to the sequence and therefore potential selection against amino acid substitutions. Conversely, the last approximately 300 residues would be exposed to antibodies produced by the host as well as binding to potential new host cells. Especially in the context of interspecies transmission, which appears to occur with some regularity among the avian astroviruses (see \u201cEpidemiology\u201d and \u201cPathogenesis\u201d sections), one could imagine considerable evolutionary pressure driving amino acid changes in this region. Studies by Strain et al. support this idea [94]. Strain et al. identified 12 codons within the TAstV-2 capsid with evidence of positive selection. Among these 12 codons, 10 were located in the C-terminal half. Additional studies are required to better understand the roles each of these regions play in the life cycle of avian astroviruses and specifically how these different roles affect their evolution.",

As such, the species do not correspond to genetic phylogenies (Figs. 9.2 and 9.6), and all the other related viruses are considered members of the genus but have not been approved as species. To address these issues, the classification of avastrovirus species is currently being redefined based on the complete amino acid sequence of the capsid protein. Based on this analysis, the avian astroviruses can be divided into two main genogroups: genogroup I and genogroup II (Fig. 9.6).\n",

In general, all of the isolates are from a particular type of cluster in distinct clades, and these clades largely correspond with the species the viruses were isolated from. The one major exception is the TAstV-1 isolate, which is found more similar to the ANV viruses (Figs. 9.2 and 9.6). However, more careful inspection of the branch order of the TAstV-2 isolates between Figs. 9.2 and 9.6 demonstrates potentially important differences. Most notably, in Fig. 9.6 the CO/2001 and MI/2001 isolates are on the same branch; however, in Fig. 9.2 they were found to be more divergent. This discrepancy is due to a potential recombination event which occurred between these two viruses at the beginning of ORF2 [94]. This results in two isolates which appear to be identical based on the capsid analysis, but, in fact, are more divergent, and suggests analysis of the capsid region in most cases may be sufficient to assign an individual isolate to a particular group; understanding how that isolate may be related to others within that group requires more extensive comparisons.",

In fact, based on the capsid there appears to be two distinct groups (Fig. 9.6).

Using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) performed with the reference ANV-1 virus (G-4260), investigations in the 1980s and 1990s have shown that ANV infections are highly prevalent in commercial chickens in Japan and in several European countries [13, 31]. Antibody to ANV was also detected in turkey flocks and in SPF flocks [13, 58]. More recently, application of two indirect IF tests developed to separately detect antibodies to two antigenically different CAstVs demonstrated that infections with both CAstV antigenic groups were very common in UK broilers and in broiler parent flocks. Antibodies to both were also detected in parent flocks from many European countries, and were also detected in some UK turkeys [105]. Using a recently developed serological test for DAstV-1, it was found that 63.2% and 51% sera samples from two commercial flocks of ducks that survived DAstV-1 were positive for DAstV [108]. Interestingly, DAstV-specific antibodies were also detected in 28.6% of 42 sera samples from a healthy flock, indicating a wide distribution of subclinical infections caused by DAstV [108]. To our knowledge, seroprevalence studies have not been reported for the TAstVs.",

Young broiler or turkey poult flocks can become horizontally infected if the housing and equipment within is contaminated with virus due to inadequate cleaning and disinfection between flocks or if the virus is introduced into the house due to poor on-farm biosecurity. Young flocks can also become infected with virus that is acquired vertically. The detection of ANV infections in chickens maintained under quarantine conditions provided indirect evidence of vertical transmission [13], but recently, the detections of low levels of ANV in late-dead duck embryos [6] and chick embryos (Todd et al., unpublished) have provided direct evidence.

Duck hepatitis virus 2 (DHV-2), isolated originally by Asplin (1965) [1], was morphologically characterized as an astrovirus in 1984 and renamed duck astrovirus 1 (DAstV-1) [22, 23]. The virus was later definitively identified as an astrovirus [102] and completely sequenced [20]. Duck hepatitis virus 3 (DHV-3), first reported by Toth in 1969 [106] and characterized by Haider and Calnek in 1979 [24], was recently identified by sequencing as a second astrovirus in ducks (DAstV-2) [102].",

Affected ducks usually die in good condition and both the mean death time and the mortality rate (10\u201350%) depend on the age of the ducks [22]. Survivors excrete virus for at least 1 week after infection and rear normally, with little evidence of retarded growth. The target organs for DAstV-1 appear to be liver and kidneys. The liver is usually pale pink with hemorrhages, and the kidneys are often swollen. Microscopic changes are characterized by extensive necrosis of hepatocytes and bile duct hyperplasia [22]. DAstV-2 has a low pathogenicity for ducklings experimentally infected, and only ducklings appear to be infected by the virus. Mortality rarely exceeds 30% [109] and mature ducks are refractory to the disease [22].",

TAstV-2 has been associated with many enteric disease syndromes in turkeys including poult enteritis complex or syndrome (PEC or PES), and poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) [8, 18, 34, 44, 70, 75, 112]. Clinical signs of the disease usually develop between 1 and 3 weeks of age and generally last up to 2 weeks [78]. Severity is usually mild to moderate and is characterized by diarrhea, listlessness, litter eating, and nervousness. Although mortality rate is low, morbidity occurring as decreased growth is of great economic concern [2, 78]. The exact role of TAstV-2 as the etiological agent of enteritis in turkeys is difficult to estimate since it can also be detected in apparently healthy turkeys [69, 76]. TAstV-1 has also been detected in healthy turkeys and turkeys with enteric disease, but is less prevalent than TAstV-2.",

TAstV-2 infection results in overall growth depression of infected birds. Common lesions observed at necropsy are dehydration, distended intestines filled with watery contents and undigested feed, and dilated ceca with foamy contents. Microscopic lesions present in the intestines consist of mild crypt hyperplasia, mild villous atrophy, and mild lymphocytic infiltration, and were most common in the jejunum [5, 41, 68]. Presence of the viruses has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by in situ hybridization (ISH) in both villi and crypt enterocytes in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ceca (Fig. 9.7) [5, 41, 59, 66, 68]. Mild lymphocytic infiltration was also observed in other organs including pancreas, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Viremia occurred after infection with TAstV-2 [41, 68]; however, only intestinal cells appear to support viral replication. The possibility exists that low levels of viral replication may occur in other tissues and may not be detected with the tests used which would explain the extra-intestinal lesions observed.\n",

ANV typically causes histological changes in the kidneys although the viral antigen can be detected in other organs including liver, spleen, pancreas, jejunum, and rectum [27, 29, 84, 86]. Young chicks are the most susceptible and become resistant to disease after the first month of life [28]. ANV infections in chicks can vary from subclinical to outbreaks of runting stunting syndrome (RSS) and nephropathy [19, 31, 86, 95, 96, 110]. However, the role of ANV infection on RSS is not clear. Although ANV affected body gain in SPF chicks [85], an experimental study on the effect of ANV and several unclassified enterovirus-like viruses (ELVs) in commercial chicks demonstrated that only one ELV, later also characterized as an ANV, analyzed among the broad panel produced clinical signs in inoculated chicks [57]. Similarly, infection of 1-day-of-age chicks with ELVs, which were later identified as the FP3 and 612 isolates of CAstV and an ANV, showed that the ELVs are able to induce more severe lesions in the intestine, the kidneys, and the pancreas than the G-4260 strain of ANV [89]. Passive and active surveys indicate that ANV is widely distributed worldwide and that serological evidence can be found in turkeys as well [13, 16, 58, 65, 95]. Although an ANV genetically related to ANV-1 was detected in the feces of turkeys [70, 72], to date the infection has never been associated with the disease in turkeys. An attempt to infect poults with the chicken-derived ANV-1 strain was unsuccessful [61].",

The virus was widely distributed in tissues, with high titers in the kidney and jejunum and lower titers in the bursa of Fabricius, spleen, and liver [26]. Transient diarrhea and weight gain depression are common signs among 1-day-old infected chickens. At necropsy, mild-to-severe discoloration and swelling in the kidneys are observed, and in dead chicks visceral urate deposits are found [26]. The microscopic lesions described in infected chickens include necrosis and degeneration of epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and moderate fibrosis. ANV virus particles and antigen were demonstrated in the degenerating kidney epithelium by electron microscopy and IF respectively [26].",

One of these isolates, isolate 19, induced diarrhea and runting and stunting in 3-week-old SPF layer chickens; however, the clinical tenosynovitis, which was seen regularly in the broilers and poults from the field, was not seen in the experimentally infected layers [15]. The isolation of these new avian astrovirus strains from chickens and turkeys with acute tenosynovitis and arthritis without the isolation of any other detectable pathogen suggests that they also might play a role in leg disorders. The pathogenicity of this virus was further demonstrated by the mortality and histopathological findings and seems to be broader than is reported for ANV-1 [15]. Many studies have shown that the pathogenicity of ANV-1 is limited to the kidney of chickens, in contrast to the damage observed in the kidney, pancreas, duodenum, thymus, bursa, and liver seen after infection with this new ANV [15]. Other ANVs have been shown to vary in pathogenicity and tropism. A Belgian PV2 isolate, originally recognized as an ELV, was shown to cause substantial growth retardation, and severe and long-lasting intestinal lesions following experimental infection [17]. Lesions were detected in the pancreas and proventriculus and were absent in the kidneys from chickens experimentally infected with PV2, suggesting that some ANV isolates such as PV2 may have different tissue tropisms [17].",

The finding of ANV in ducklings dead in shell indicates naturally occurring vertical infection and it is possible that ANV may play a role in the death of duckling embryos. ANVs were also detected by RT-PCR in 89% of fecal samples from young pigeons suffering from diarrhea, whereas samples from healthy pigeons were negative [115]. In another study, a very high prevalence of ANV was found among feral pigeons and wood pigeons [45]. Astrovirus was detected in almost all juvenile birds, while the detection rate among the adults was 62%. In this case, most birds appeared healthy, and it was not possible to correlate the presence of a virus to any illness in the birds. ANV-like viruses have also been detected in guinea fowl but the role they play in disease is not clear [8].",

An experimental infection with the FP3 CAstV strain, which was originally known as ELV-3 and which is genetically and antigenically distinct from the 612 strain isolate, caused no clinical signs in 1-day-old broilers [57].

Furthermore, there is little evidence of inflammation and little or no increase in cell death following astrovirus infection [5, 41, 101], further suggesting astrovirus clinical signs result from submicroscopic changes in the intestine. Initial studies to identify physiological changes in infected poults demonstrated changes to ultrastructure of the epithelial cells including rearrangement of F-actin. These changes were associated with decreased apical expression of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) with a concomitant decrease in sodium absorption [66]. Collectively, these data suggest that astrovirus infection induces a malabsorption, osmotic diarrhea, possibly through redistribution of specific brush border enzymes and transporters resulting from dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton [64, 66, 75, 101].",

Additionally, thymocytes and splenocytes that were exposed to the virus in vitro also demonstrated a reduced proliferative response [74]. In subsequent studies, Qureshi et al. reported TAstV-2 infections also resulted in impaired migration, phagocytic activity, and bacterial killing activity of innate immune cells, as compared with controls [73]. Functional examination of the innate immune cells (macrophages and heterophils) from TAstV-2 infected poults demonstrated reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 [73]. Interestingly, studies by Koci et al. demonstrated significant increases in the levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in the serum of TAstV-2 infected poults [41].

Studies by Qureshi et al. and Koci et al. have both demonstrated that macrophages and adherent splenocytes from TAstV-2-infected poults produce more nitric oxide (NO) following ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysccharide than do cells from uninfected controls [40, 73]. NO has long been recognized as a potent anti-viral effector molecule; however, histological examination of TAstV-2 infected poults does not demonstrate large influxes of macrophages or other innate immune cells. To determine if NO could play a role in the regulation of TAstV-2 replication, the virus was exposed to NO donor compounds in vitro prior to inoculating embryos, and found to inactivate the virus [40]. Conversely, when embryos were pretreated with an inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzyme virus replication increased significantly [40, 51]. Finally, to determine if TAstV-2-infected intestines demonstrated an increase in the expression of iNOS, tissues from TAstV-2-infected turkey poults were stained for the presence of TAstV-2 antigen and turkey iNOS. These experiments demonstrated an increase in iNOS expression following TAstV-2 infection, with the majority of the staining localized to the intestinal epithelium suggesting that in the absence of a response from either innate or adaptive immune cells the intestine is capable of mounting its own innate defense [59].",

            "text": "The detection of clinical signs, gross pathological findings, and histological lesions is required before disease can be diagnosed. However, in the case of astroviruses, these in themselves may not be sufficient to identify the causal virus. For example, hepatitis in ducklings may be caused by one of the two different astroviruses: DAstV-1 and DAstV-2, originally known as duck hepatitis virus types 2 and 3, or the picornavirus, originally known as duck hepatitis virus type 1 [109]. Similarly, histological lesions consistent with nephritis in chickens can be caused by ANV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and CAstV (Todd et al., unpublished results). In cases of hepatitis and nephritis, the presence of a specific astrovirus needs to be demonstrated in the affected tissue, preferably at the site of the histological lesion. This can be achieved using immunohistochemistry (IHC), undertaken with paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissue, or immunofluorescence (IF) performed with frozen tissue or tissue impression smears. However, due to the limited availability of avian astrovirus-specific antibodies, to date these methods have received limited application. IF is used to diagnose hepatitis in ducklings caused by DAstV-2 [24]. Very recently, a prototype immunoperoxidase-based IHC method has been applied to demonstrate the presence of CAstV antigen in nephritis-associated histological lesions (Todd et al., unpublished results; Fig. 9.8). This work suggested that CAstV alone was capable of causing nephritis in chickens and highlighted the need to identify the virus responsible in cases of nephritis and visceral gout. Imada et al. has reported that IF is a useful diagnostic procedure for ANV, detecting the group antigens and staining infected kidneys during the early acute phase of the disease [26]. In situ hybridization (ISH) can also be used to detect the presence of viral nucleic acid at the site of the histological lesion. Because probes generated from cloned virus-specific cDNA fragments may be more easily produced than virus-specific antibodies, ISH may prove to be an easier approach to develop. ISH has been used to demonstrate the presence of TAstV-2 RNA within the enterocytes present on the sides of the villi from virus-infected turkeys, but its use to detect other avian astroviruses has not yet been reported [5, 41, 68].\n",

The method first used was negative contrast electron microscopy (EM), which depended on the visualization of the characteristic five- and six-pointed star morphology that characterizes astroviruses. EM performed with enteric samples has been used for the diagnosis of TAstVs and for the diagnosis of DAstV-1 in liver samples from ducks with hepatitis [23, 56]. However, astrovirus diagnosis by EM has a number of drawbacks, the most important being that some avian astroviruses fail to display the characteristic star morphology. This appears to be the case for ANV, DAstV-2, and CAstV, which are detected as small spherical viruses without obvious surface structure, and, on this basis, these were originally considered to be picornaviruses (ANV) or enterovirus-like viruses (CAstV, DAstV-2) [57]. Additional drawbacks of EM include its relative lack of sensitivity, and its unsuitability for the testing of large samples due to the time, labor, and equipment required.",

            "text": "Virus isolation in embryonated eggs or cell culture has been successful for most of the avian astroviruses including ANV, CAstV, TAstV, and DAstV. TAstV and DAstV can be propagated in turkey and duck embryos, respectively, and sometimes in chick embryos as well [98, 109]. Although the propagation of DAstV-1 (formerly DHV-2) in cell culture has been reported [4], the propagation of TAstV in cell cultures has not. The growth of high yields of TAstV isolates in turkey embryos has facilitated the production of purified virus, with which virus-specific antibodies have been prepared [97]. The astroviruses from chickens can be propagated in chicken embryos and in cell culture. CAstVs can be propagated in SPF chick embryos following yolk sac inoculation to produce variable effects including early embryo death, dwarfing, hemorrhages, edema, and feather changes [91]. ANVs can be propagated in SPF embryos following egg inoculation using a variety of routes. Isolation of ANV in cell cultures has been reported in a number of studies [19, 25, 110], and induces a cell rounding CPE in primary chicken kidney cells typically within 72 h post infection [26] . Experience from some laboratories suggests that some ANVs may be non-cultivable and the inconsistent growth of some ANVs in primary cell culture and embryos has prompted speculation that embryos containing ANV antibody may inhibit in vitro propagation (Todd et al. unpublished results). Baxendale and Mebatsion have reported the isolation and propagation of CAstVs in primary chick embryo liver cells and LMH cells, in which plaques similar to those produced by DAstV (DHV-2) were obtained [4]. The CAstV isolates have been used in virus neutralization tests, with which antibody to CAstV was detected [4]. There is also evidence that CAstVs can non-productively infect when inoculated into primary chick embryo liver cells [105]. In these cases, the inoculated CAstV undergoes partial replication, producing virus proteins that can be detected by indirect IF without producing infectious virus and CPE [105]. The effects produced by particular avian astroviruses in cell culture or in experimentally inoculated embryos are relatively nonspecific and cannot easily be distinguished from the effects caused by other avian astroviruses or other viruses. As such, the cultured virus needs to be identified; this can be accomplished through the detection of virus-specific antigens or nucleic acid. Although cultivable virus isolates are essential for biological characterization and pathogenesis studies, virus isolation is not routinely used to detect avian astroviruses, the principal reason being that astrovirus-containing samples are frequently contaminated with viruses such as adenoviruses or reoviruses, which replicate faster than the astroviruses in cell culture and/or in embryos. In addition, virus isolation and identification is time-consuming and labor-intensive, making it unsuitable for testing large samples.",

            "text": "Attention has focused increasingly on the use of molecular diagnostic tests for detecting avian astroviruses. Since the first report describing an RT-PCR test for detecting TAstV [43], conventional and/or real-time tests have been described for ANV [14, 54, 103], CAstV [70]; [89], and DAstV [6] as well as TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 [14, 41, 93, 97]. The primers for these tests are usually located in the genomic regions encoding nonstructural proteins such as the RNA polymerase (ORF 1b), which are more conserved than the capsid protein encoding region (ORF 2). However, the high levels of sequence diversity displayed by avian astroviruses species make it difficult to select primers that will detect all variants within one type. Therefore, primer design should be based on comparing sequences from as large a number of virus variants as possible and the need to incorporate degenerate primers recognized. The importance of primer selection was highlighted when it was shown that the RT-PCR test using primers located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) was more successful in detecting ANV-positive samples than tests based on primers located in the nonstructural protease or RNA polymerase [89, 103]. Similarly, CAstV from all genetic groupings was detected by the conventional and real-time RT-PCR tests described by Smyth et al. [88, 89], whereas one CAstV grouping was not detected by another published test [14]. Applications of these molecular tests have demonstrated that TAstV, ANV, and CAstV are highly prevalent in samples from their respective hosts, and there is a strong likelihood that the vast majority of commercial chicken and turkey flocks will become infected at some point in their lifetimes [18, 69, 70, 89]. Therefore, since all enteric samples are likely to be positive using these highly sensitive RT-PCR methods, knowing that an enteric sample is astrovirus positive is of questionable importance. However, with regard to the impact that the infection may be having on the flock or bird, there may be considerably more value in knowing the amounts of virus present, and in knowing whether internal tissues such as the kidney or liver are virus positive.",

A major reason for this is the limited number of avian astrovirus strains that have been adapted to cell culture. Although a number of ANV isolates can be propagated in cell culture, with very few exceptions cell culture isolations of CAstVs, TAstVs, and DAstVs have not been described. The lack of cell culture methods limits the development of indirect IF assays and virus neutralization tests to analyze chicken, turkey, and duck sera for antibodies. Additionally, the development of other serological assays such as ELISAs requires the ability to produce ample quantities of virus and virus antigen. With limited cell culture propagation methods, only a few laboratories have developed these assays for understanding astrovirus serology. An ELISA for detecting ANV antibody was described by Decaesstecker and Meulemans [16]. Sellers et al. have reported the use of an ELISA for detecting antibodies to CAstV using recombinantly expressed capsid protein [83]. Wang et al. [108] and Zhao et al. [114] also developed similar ELISA tests using recombinant capsid proteins for detecting DAstV and ANV-specific antibodies in duck and chicken serum samples.",

[85] have demonstrated that ANV strains representing serotype 1 (ANV-1) and serotype 2 (ANV-2) exhibit very low levels of cross-reactive antibodies using indirect IF. Todd et al. [104] have recently reported the common occurrence of ANV variants, which displayed very different capsid protein sequences from those of ANV-1 and ANV-2, and which, on this basis, are likely to be antigenically different. This view is supported by a recent work by de Wit et al. [16], who showed that serum samples containing antibodies to a novel ANV isolate (isolate 19) were not detected by an ANV-1 specific indirect IF assay. It is recognized that the CAstVs can be subdivided into two major antigenic groups, designated A and B, which display relatively low levels of cross-reactivity by indirect IF [90, 105]. For this reason, a recent CAstV seroprevalence study involved the application of two separate indirect IF tests, one based on isolate 612 for detecting antibodies to the CAstVs from Group A, and the second based on isolate 11672 for detecting antibodies to the Group B CAstVs [105]. Therefore, the antigenic diversities exhibited by ANV and CAstV need to be considered in relation to their serological diagnosis. Serological tests based on the use of single ANV or CAstV strains will not detect antibodies to all ANV or CAstV infections. This is of particular importance when testing SPF flocks to demonstrate freedom from infection.",

In addition, astroviruses are very stable in the environment and resistant to inactivation by most routinely used disinfectants, which complicates its elimination from infected premises [82].

Similarly, commercial vaccines have not been developed for ANV, CAstV, and TAstVs. In the case of ANV and CAstV, which are known to be vertically transmitted, vaccine protocols focused on the parent flocks during rear should be considered as a method to prevent or limit transmission to progeny in ovo. In addition, breeder vaccination should ensure uniformly higher levels of maternal antibody, which would better equip the young birds to withstand early viral challenges. The development of live attenuated or inactivated avian astrovirus vaccines will both depend on the availability of cell or embryo culture methods. Alternatively, recombinant expression systems, such as recombinant baculovirus system, might be used to produce astrovirus capsid subunit vaccines. Sellers et al.

As part of this effort to better understand avian astroviruses, the avian virology community should be encouraged to more fully characterize representative members of each genotype, serotype, and subgroup. This would include not only sequencing, but also the development of antibodies and other reagents.
