Widespread criminal production and distribution of counterfeit artesunate tablets in this region has resulted in the deaths of many people who would otherwise have survived their malaria infection. The spurious artesunate tablets contain no active drug. They are labelled to resemble a product, manufactured by Guilin Pharmaceutical Company, Guilin, People's Republic of China, that is the most commonly available brand of artesunate.1, 2\n",

High-performance liquid chromatography confirmed the absence of artesunate. The main distinguishing features of the first new counterfeit, from the genuine product are a different mountain silhouette and the absence of the legend Guilin Pharma written on the hologram. This can just be seen with the naked eye as a pale strip. The printing on the counterfeit blisterpack is less clear than that on the genuine product and all four samples collected were printed with the code 00902 and manufacture and expiry dates of 09/00 and 09/03.",

International organisations, including WHO, have done little to counter this lethal trade. This inaction is partly because of the lack of resources available for the regulation and policing of the drug supply in tropical countries, the secrecy of the pharmaceutical industry, possible links between the counterfeiters and officials in the producing countries, and because the effects of fake antimalarials are disguised in the unrecognised deaths of the rural poor.4, 5 Such failure to act contrasts with the recent rapid mobilisation of public-health resources to counter severe acute respiratory syndrome in the same region. We believe that urgent action is needed to find, prosecute, and close down the factories, collect and incinerate all suspect artesunate, prosecute the shops selling it, warn the public, and ensure that inexpensive quality-assured antimalarial drugs are made readily available.",
