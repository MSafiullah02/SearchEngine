The genes responsible for many of these diseases have also been identified. Recent advances in diagnostic procedures have enabled these to be identified earlier and appropriately treated. While a number of approaches are available to identify mutations, direct sequencing remains the gold standard. This approach identifies the exact genetic change with substantial precision. We suggest that a sensitive and economical approach to mutation detection could be the direct sequencing of cDNA followed by the confirmatory sequencing of the corresponding exon. While screening techniques such as single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP), heteroduplex analysis (HA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) have proven useful, each has inherent advantages and disadvantages.

This protection is achieved through both nonspecific (innate) and specific (adaptive) immune responses. Defects in either of these components of the immune system leads to disease and may ultimately result in death. This is particularly apparent in primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), which are caused by congenital defects of the immune system [Bonilla and Geha, 2006] . While several diagnostic criteria exist for determining if an individual is suffering from a PID [Conley et al., 1999] , the hallmark signs are the presentation of recurrent infections with pathogens to which the host normally displays effective resistance, such as Pneumocystis carinii. The laboratory-based diagnosis of PIDs involves enumerating leukocyte cell numbers and evaluating their functional responses. While these approaches are useful in classifying the type of PID, their classification cannot be definitively established without determining the genotype. Since the genes responsible for many PIDs are known, genetic typing is possible [Notarangelo et al., 2006] .

Relevant research publications that detail the particular molecular approach used to diagnose the particular disease are also highlighted, and should therefore be consulted as a starting point in the analysis of a gene of interest.

An example of the former is the detection of specific mutations in the MASP-2 gene (MIM] 605102), which regulates serum levels of the human mannose binding lectin protein (MASP). Levels of this protein are modulated by three known sequence variations clustered in exon 1 [Turner and Hamvas, 2000 ]. Individuals with low or absent MASP protein should thus be screened for these sequence variations. However, for most genes, searching for previously characterized sequence variation is not useful, as mutational hotspots are uncommon. For example, X-linked CGD is predominantly caused by mutations in the protein gp91 phox . By plotting the location of amino acid substitutions vs. their location in the protein, amino acid changes are scattered along the entire length of the protein with no discernable mutation hotspots (Fig. 3) . This is common for many diseases, and makes mutation-specific detection technology unsuitable, as it is not uncommon for individuals to possess unique mutation(s). Laboratories must therefore interrogate the entire gene of interest to identify the location and nature of the disease-causing mutation. Since the average size of human genes is 10-15 kb and the number of exons/gene is nine [Sakharkar et al., 2005] , mutation scanning techniques, such as SSCP, HA, dHPLC, DGGE, temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), and conformation-sensitive gradient electrophoresis (CSGE) are used to rapidly identify products where a mutation may exist.

All of these sequence variations can be identified using the techniques outlined above. All screening techniques require the gene of interest be amplified by PCR. Individual exon(s) are amplified either as one product, or if individual exons are very large, in smaller overlapping fragments and then subjected to mutation screening.

We suggest that direct sequencing of cDNA is an efficient approach for detecting most pathogenic mutations. Since cells from the blood can be easily obtained for analysis, this facilitates FIGURE 1. Flowchart outlining our current approach in the diagnosis of X-linked chronic granulomatous disease. Initial diagnosis is made by assessing biological cellular function or products (1). An assessment of superoxide production can provide a rapid guide to CGD diagnosis (2). In X-linked diseases, a\u00a1ected females should display a mosaic phenotype that can be seen with the nitroblue tetrazolium test (3).The presence/absence of a protein can then be used to help subclassify the precise variant of CGD (4), of which three variants exist for the X-linked form (5).Total RNA from the a\u00a1ected individual as well as any other family members is isolated and converted into cDNA (6);The CYBB gene is then ampli\u00a2ed using the cDNA as the template and the products are directly sequenced (7); If a mutation is not found (8), then other variants need to be assessed, such as the autosomal form of CGD (9), and mutation analysis should be performed on the most likely gene involved (10); any mutation should be con\u00a2rmed at the genomic level, where the corresponding exon should be ampli\u00a2ed and sequenced (11); any mutations/polymorphisms should then be screened against other known mutations (12). If the mutation has not been reported previously then it needs to be excluded as a novel polymorphism by either restriction enzyme digestion or by allele speci\u00a2c PCR (13). Novel mutations can then be submitted to the relevant database, such as CYBB base for the CYBB gene (14). the process of RNA isolation. Cost, in terms of time and reagents, is one of the main limiting factors associated with the sequencing of multi-exon genes without a prior screening approach. For example, the CYBB gene consists of 12 exons [Royer-Pokora et al., 1986] , which require a minimum of 24 primers for their amplification. Each exon must be sequenced in both directions to confirm the sequence. Thus, at least 24 sequencing reactions are needed to screen the entire gene. If the nominal cost/ sequencing reaction is US$10/sample, then the total cost of sequencing alone is US$240/sample. We now routinely prepare cDNA from patient cells and using overlapping pairs of primers, amplify and sequence the entire cDNA (Fig. 2) . We have been able to amplify the entire CYBB cDNA using only five pairs of primers, reducing the cost. Once a mutation is observed, the corresponding exon is then sequenced to confirm its presence at the genomic level (Figs. 1 and 2).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2017, "end": 2044, "text": "[Royer-Pokora et al., 1986]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2501, "end": 2509, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "cDNA Analysis"}, {"text": "A disadvantage of this approach is that it is dependent upon the presence of suitable mRNA in the patient sample.
