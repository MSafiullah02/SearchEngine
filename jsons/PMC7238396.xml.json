Projections estimate that, without improved treatment methods, COVID-19 could cause 100,000\u2013240,000 deaths in the USA [1]. In vitro and in vivo studies have identified the antimalarial medicine hydroxychloroquine as a potential pharmacological treatment option [2\u20134]. Currently, hydroxychloroquine is a well-established medication prescribed to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [4].",

Furthermore, the fact that a greater percentage of patients with a hydroxychloroquine prescription were tested might reflect providers having higher indexes of suspicion of COVID-19 in these patients. This is interesting because our expectation is that an inherently immunocompromised population, such as one prescribed hydroxychloroquine, would be more likely to contract COVID-19. That being said, further study of hydroxychloroquine is warranted to ensure its efficacy as a means of prophylactically preventing the onset or progression of COVID-19. While these data are observational in a relatively small population and a clinical trial would be most helpful, we may lose valuable time and invaluable lives while waiting for trial results, considering the projected mortality due to COVID-19. We encourage other healthcare systems to examine their own databases to see if the trends we identified can be seen more broadly (Table 1).",
