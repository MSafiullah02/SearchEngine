The current situation of the world is no less than a world war which has put everyone in a skeptical situation especially dealing with young and blank minds. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created anxieties, turbulence, and fears in the young minds, and they barrage their parents with heaps of questions. COVID-19 has caused a global concern for Public Health Emergency. However, still the ongoing debate on the emergence of virus and its immediate host has proved its homology with bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13 (Li et al. 2020). It is responsible for the social and economic losses worldwide and is being transmitted at a very rapid pace. Health experts are still sailing in turbulent ocean to find an effective drug or vaccine. COVID-19-infected children may be asymptomatic or may present clinical symptoms such as fever, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue including upper respiratory symptoms, congestion (Hong et al. 2020). Clinical reports also suggest poor immune response of the patients and are still trying to unveil the virus and its menaces (Weiss and Murdoch 2020). Along with the elderly population who are considered to be at the greater risk, even young children are not spared by the virus. According to the journal Pediatrics, nearly 2143 cases were reported in which 90% of children reported mild or moderate symptoms and were found to be at lower risk. But 6% of children showed intense and acute symptoms although none of the children died (Dong et al. 2020). Now the main concern was how to tackle the children and teach them to isolate themselves. Figure 15.1 explains the three categories of people and their role for not letting the infection escalate.\n",

Either they are taking it just a vacation which can be enjoyed by numerous ways or they are in a dilemma about the repercussions of not following the rules.

While talking to the children, it is important that we should tell the truth to the children that if they follow the proper guidelines they will be alright instead of maximizing their fears just to make them sit quietly. It becomes necessary as a parent to rub off their fears and prevent creating a difficult scenario (Rich 2020). For this we need to understand the state of mind of the children as they may have:Limited or no information or even misinformationFear and panic about the current pandemicStress and frustrated with their parents expressions and reactionsThe advices for parents facing the wrath of their children include:Control of their anxiety levels first.Do not panic in the presence of children around the topic as our conduct cause ripples in their minds.Introspection of self-mental status before facing the children.Keep your fear, aggravation, and apprehension aside and prepare yourself for a fact-based conversation.Try to find out what our children know about the virus and what are their misconceptions.Lend your ears patiently before giving any suggestions or falling in any arguments.Then discuss about basic guidelines of prevention.Never load your child with your worries and future concerns.Tell them about the meaning and necessity of lockdown and self-isolation.Reassure your child that the concerned people are working round the clock and leaving no stone unturned to control the situation.Tell them that we can also support in bringing down the pandemic by playing our role wisely like distancing ourselves socially, maintaining routine hygiene and cleanliness, limiting travels, taking a balanced diet to avoid any other health issues, and take care of physical as well as mental well-being.Avoid watching or reading information causing panic and stress.Playing games, reading story books painting together, and doing household chores together can be followed.Making children sit and study is really a tough job. Let us make them learn and earn.We can give them a chance to earn money to buy their favorite toy or gadget in future by making them do what we want them to.We have to try our best to keep them busy, so that they remain calm and engaged during the pandemic to distress them and also provide them useful factual information to remain safe without anxiety.We have to explain our kids that COVID virus is very arrogant and egoistic; hence, it will not come to your house unless and until you go out to bring it home.\n\n",
