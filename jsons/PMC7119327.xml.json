However, clear examples of balanced polymorphisms are few, and we have to beware of altruistic interpretations. Perhaps the best evidence is where there is a tradeoff between resistance to infection and genetic disease. This is seen in the various hemoglobinopathies (\u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia) where the resistance to infection with the malaria parasite of those who are heterozygous for the gene mutation counterbalances the lethal effects of recessive disease in homozygotes. The relatively high frequency of cystic fibrosis may also be explained if those heterozygous for mutations in the chloride channel (CTFR) survive severe enteric infections such as typhoid because of reduced dehydration; in this case, heterozgotes may be considered the functional equivalent of oral rehydration therapy.",

The delta 32 deletion in the gene encoding the CCR5 chemokine receptor is frequent in the Caucasian population. Homozygotes appear to be healthy and are resistant to infection by the majority of strains of HIV-1 that require this receptor to enter their target cells. Heterozygotes also benefit from relative resistance to infection and, when infected, progress to AIDS more slowly. But like cholera and CTFR, HIV is too recent an arrival in humans to account for the selection of delta 32 CCR5. Resistance to smallpox or the plague has been postulated as the original selective force, but compelling evidence has not been forthcoming.",

To date, however, scanning the genome for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or other markers has not been particularly fruitful in revealing genetic loci associated with a trait for infectious diseases. This is due to the fact that much of the genetic variation underlying infectious disease susceptibility is complex, involving the combination of many loci, and is further confounded by SNP variations between different populations and ethnic groups. Such surveys, therefore, require careful design, and it may be that identifying loci in animal models is a more straightforward way of highlighting loci and genes in humans. Correspondingly, it has been more fruitful thus far to identify polymorphisms in candidate human genes for infectious disease.",

Obvious candidate genes have been investigated in HIV pathogenesis. As expected, both class I and class II genes in the MHC region affect HIV susceptibility and disease progression (Carrington and O'Brien, 2003), but it is the combination of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d alleles that determines the phenotype of the disease. There is even a suggestion that rare MHC alleles offer stronger cellular immune responses to HIV because the viral peptide sequences have mutated to evade the more common MHC genotypes (Scherer et al., 2004).",

Most of the transmissible strains of HIV-1 require the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a fusion receptor after the virus particles bind to the CD4 receptor on host T cells. There are widespread polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CCR5 gene that affect the density of receptor expression on the surface of CD4+ T lymphocytes. There is also polymorphism in the number of gene copies of its main ligand, the CCL3L1 form of the cytokine MIP-1\u03b1. Careful analysis of susceptibility to HIV infection and progression to AIDS in large human cohorts reveals that it is the combination of CCR5 and CCL3L1 polymorphisms that has the most telling effect on disease (Gonzalez et al., 2005). High chemokine expression combined with low receptor expression delays the development of AIDS in the host. This makes sense from our understanding of HIV entry into cells because CCL3L1 competes with HIV for a limiting number of receptors.",

Most of us become infected in infancy without diagnosed illness, although infection in adolescence causes infectious mononucleosis. But if an infant is homozyogous for the Duncan's syndrome allele, primary infection leads to uncontrollable, lethal mononucleosis. Curiously, this gene appears to affect the response to EBV exclusively; it is not related to a more general immune deficiency.",

Perhaps we should not only seek microbial markers of virulence but also spend more effort on identifying the human genetic factors that predispose to invasion by pathogens. Moreover, common infections with low virulence may represent the unknown environmental trigger for diseases that are not clearly infectious\u2014such as, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia\u2014when they infect a genotype predisposed to the disease.",

Advances in analysis of gene expression profiling via microarrays, and also in proteomics, not only show how pathogens remodel the host's gene expression patterns (Jenner and Young, 2005) but also provide a wealth of candidate genes for genetic susceptibility studies. Some of these changes are common to large groups of infection; for instance, many viruses stimulate interferon response pathways. Changes in gene expression profiles can also betray the type of pathogen present with the potential of identifying the pathogen through host gene expression (Huang et al., 2001). Thus, gene expression patterns in blood could serve as a window into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Whole blood and purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibit interpatient variation, reflected in the global gene expression patterns of the samples but nevertheless can be interpreted through knowledge of other clinical parameters such as differential blood counts, temperature, and gender. When these are accounted for, the remaining gene expression changes indicate both general infection and disease-specific responses (Griffiths et al., 2005, Whitney et al., 2003).",

Because KSHV-infected lymphoma cells show upregulation of the vitamin D receptor pathway, known inhibitors of that pathway may be explored therapeutically (Jenner et al., 2003). Similarly, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors were successfully tested for reduction of CMV titer after detection of upregulation of COX-2 expression in infected cells.
