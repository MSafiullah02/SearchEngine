Several newspaper articles raised the question, however, whether the study reports an accurate confidence interval (CI) for its IFR estimate.",

The question is whether doing so is appropriate, or if N D should be treated as random. We argue that the answer depends on whether \u03b8 is interpreted as an estimate of the IFR among the N I infected individuals, or an estimate of the IFR among all N T members of the population. To clarify this point, we postulate the existence of vectors D = (D 1 , . . . , D N T ), I = (I 1 , . . . , I N T ) and S = (S 1 , . . . , S N T ), with D j \u2208 {0, 1} an indicator for the (possibly counterfactual) event that the jth individual in the population would have died in the study period if s/he had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, I j \u2208 {0, 1} an indicator for the jth individual actually being infected, and S j \u2208 {0, 1} an indicator for the jth individual being included in the sample.

The CI C \u03b1 1 clearly does not have correct coverage for \u03b8 2 though, with or without conditioning on I. Intuitively, an appropriate CI for \u03b8 2 should be wider than C \u03b1 1 , but it is not immediately obvious how such a CI should be constructed.

            "text": "We note that Streeck et al. (2020) report an estimated 1,956 infected individuals, an IFR of .36%, and a CI for the IFR of [0.29%; 0.45%]. These results differ from the N I , \u03b8 and C \u03b1 1 given above for two reasons: first, Streeck et al. (2020) apply an adjustment factor to the raw infection rate in their sample to account for the sensitivity and specificity of their test for SARS-CoV-2 infection; and second, their sample is generated through a form of cluster sampling, which leads to a slightly wider CI relative to simple random sampling. Such adjustments should also slightly widen our CIs for \u03b8 2 .",

To give an economic example, suppose that there is a group of individuals that qualify for benefits from some public program, and that the researcher is interested in the share of these individuals that actually receive benefits (this share could be small if the program is not well-known, difficult to apply for, or comes with social stigma). This then fits into the framework of this note if the number of benefit recipients is known to administrators, but the number of qualifying individuals needs to be estimated from survey data.",
