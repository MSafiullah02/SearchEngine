This large group of proteins which includes the mannose receptor, DEC-205 or langerin, is specialized in the recognition of carbohydrate structures present on cellular and viral proteins and is implicated in several processes such as cell adhesion and antigen presentation (1,2). DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are constitutively expressed by specific cell populations that play a key role in the activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. DC-SIGN is highly expressed at the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) localized in the lymphoid tissues (thymus, tonsils, or lymph nodes), mucosal surface, and in the dermis (3\u20135). DC-SIGN is not expressed by Langerhans cells, which are a unique DC subset residing in epidermis. Certain macrophages such as Hofbauer cells in the placenta, Kupffer cells in the liver sinusoids, and alveolar macrophages have been shown to express DC-SIGN (3,4). L-SIGN expression is restricted to endothelial cells such as those in lymph nodes, placenta, and, particularly, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (6,7).",

Both lectins are type II transmembrane proteins composed of a short cytoplasmic tail responsible for signalling and internalization, a transmembrane region, a neck domain consisting of eight repeat regions of 23 amino acids and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) which binds carbohydrate ligands in a calcium-dependent manner (1,3,4) (Fig. 1). The DC-SIGN CRD recognizes different mannose or fucose-based carbohydrates whereas the L-SIGN CRD appears to interact only with mannose residues on N-glycans (Man5GlucNac2 to Man9GlucNac2) (8,9). The repeat regions within the neck domain permit the oligomerization of the lectins which is critical for their biological activities, because only tetramers efficiently capture glycosylated ligands (10\u201312).\n\n",

            "text": "DC-SIGN was originally cloned for its ability to bind and internalize the heavily glycosylated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 protein (13). DC-SIGN strongly binds all HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains examined to date and plays an important role in virus adhesion to DC (14). These studies have paved the way for further investigations into interactions between DC-SIGN and pathogens and it has become clear that many viruses target DC-SIGN and L-SIGN to bind DCs and endothelial cells, respectively. Both lectins recognize high mannose oligosaccharides present on viral glycoproteins and thus function as attachment factors for several viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV), dengue (DV), Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hepatitis C (HCV), Marburg and Sindbis viruses (Table 1) (10,15\u201327). Differential glycosylation of viral envelope glycoproteins strongly influences the efficiency of viral capture by DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (10,19,22). For example, the DV envelope glycoprotein E has two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-67 and Asn-153 that mediate DV binding to DCs (22). Only mannosylated E glycoproteins (which are exposed at the surface of DV virions transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes), and not E proteins with complex glycosylation (produced in mammalian cells), have been shown to interact with DC-SIGN-expressing cells (22).\n\n",

Despite findings showing that a large fraction of viral particles captured by DC-SIGN are rapidly internalized and degraded (28,29), viruses are nevertheless able to hijack DC-SIGN and L-SIGN functions to spread infection. For the viruses examined to date, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have been shown to act as attachment factors rather than authentic entry receptors involved in membrane fusion. This does not exclude the possibility that some viruses, and particularly those that require targeting to acidified endosomes for membrane fusion, use these lectins as primary entry receptors. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have also been shown to function as \u201ccis-receptors\u201d that enhance infection of target cells. This mechanism, known as cis-infection, has been described for DV, CMV, and HIV, and probably relies on the capacity of these lectins to concentrate viral particles at the cell surface, allowing optimal interaction with their cognate receptors and enhanced viral entry (Table 1) (18,22,30). Viruses captured by DC-SIGN or L-SIGN can also be transmitted in trans to target cells expressing the entry receptors (\u201ctrans-infection\u201d), as has been proposed for HIV, HCV, and SARS virus (14,16,26,31). For HIV and CMV, DC-SIGN enhances infection of target cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). DC-SIGN-bound viruses infect target cells more efficiently than free viruses and remain infectious for several days (14,18). The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood.",

Their role as principal attachment factors for a broad range of enveloped viruses and their restricted expression in anatomical site of virus exposure suggest that these two lectins dictate viral tropism for DCs and endothelial cells and consequently may influence viral pathogenesis. DCs are sentinel cells that capture pathogens entering skin or mucosal tissues and then migrate to the lymph nodes where they present processed antigens to T-cells, initiating adaptive immune responses. By interacting with DC-SIGN, viruses that are transmitted sexually (such as HIV) or through introduction into human skin by an insect vector (such as dengue virus or Sindbis virus) may hijack DC function either to modulate the immune response or to assure their dissemination from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs (32). LSECs also participate in the capture and processing of foreign antigens, in addition to the elimination of undesirable macromolecules from the blood by transporting them to hepatocytes (6,7). LSECs represent a barrier separating the liver and the blood and could be exploited by viruses such as HCV in order to gain access to hepatocytes (16,33,34). We recommend the two following reviews for an overview of the physiological importance of LSECs in viral infections of the liver (6,7).",

            "text": "\nSoluble viral glycoproteins are produced using the SFV vector in BHK mammalian cells. SFV shuts off the cellular translation machinery and so transduced cells produce only the viral protein of interest, which is secreted and accumulates in the supernatant of infected cells. This allows the production of large amounts of soluble proteins with a high degree of purity. The SFV expression vector was originally described in reviews (35\u201337). Briefly, the SFV genome is a single-stranded, positive RNA which encodes both structural and nonstructural viral proteins. A signal sequence in the 5\u2032 RNA domain permits specific viral genome packaging. The SFV vector is made of two cDNAs (pSFV-\u0394env and pSFV-helper2) (Fig. 2). The first codes for the SFV RNA genome in which the sequence corresponding to structural proteins is replaced by the soluble glycoprotein of interest (pSFV-\u0394env). The structural proteins are encoded by a second cDNA (pSFV-helper2) which lacks the packaging signal. cDNAs are transcribed in vitro and transfected into cells by electroporation. In this way, only RNAs encoding the protein of interest are packaged into new defective viral particles. The SFV envelope proteins are activated by the furin cleavage in the Golgi apparatus. Replacement of the furin site by a chymotrypsin site allows control of SFV particle activation.pSFV-helper2 and pSFV-\u0394env have been previously described (35\u201337). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments coding for soluble glycoprotein of interest are usually digested either by BssH II (5\u2032) and Nsi I (3\u2032), by BssH II (5\u2032) and Apa I (3\u2032) or by BamH I (5\u2032 and 3\u2032) and then introduced into pSFV-\u0394env (10,22,38).Restriction enzymes Spe I and Sph I are purchased from New England Biolabs.

This results in the production of soluble glycoproteins carrying only mannose N-glycans (Figs. 3 and 4). Supernatants are clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 850 g at room temperature) and concentrated (see\nSubheading 2.3., item 11).The glycosylation pattern of the proteins produced can be verified by treatment with endoglycosidase H (endoH; 2 mU, Roche) or Peptide: N-Glycosidase F (PNGAse F; 1000 U, Biolabs). An example is given in Fig. 4A. Only HIV gp120 bearing mannose N-glycans (HIV gp120DMJ produced in presence of DMJ and swainsonine) is sensitive to EndoH. In contrast, PNGaseF treatment allows complete de-glycosylation of HIV gp120 produced either in the presence or absence of inhibitors. The molecular weight of the exclusively mannosylated HIV gp120 is inferior to that of gp120 produced in the absence of mannosidase inhibitors. This is a result of the lower molecular weight of mannose residues compared to complex glycosylation.\n",

For this reason, we use cell lines expressing L-SIGN and we describe only the generation of monocyte-derived DCs that constitutively express DC-SIGN.Alternatively, the SFV particle production can be bypassed. The electroporation of BHK cells with pSFV-\u0394 env permits to directly produce the recombinant protein coded by the modified SFV plasmid. This alternative protocol is similar to Subheading 3.2.1., steps 1 and 2, except that the amount of pSFV-\u0394 env RNA transfected is doubled. The quantity of RNA electroporated may require adjustment depending on the gene of interest. The maximum volume of RNA we have electroporated is 150 \u00b5L. The next step of the recombinant protein production with this alternative protocol continues at Subheading 3.2.3., step 2. The advantage of production of viral particles is that cells can be infected at equal MOI and hence the quantity of protein produced is more reproducible than direct electroporation with pSFV-\u0394env RNA.The quality of transcribed RNA is verified by agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis. Transcribed RNAs can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C before electroporation.Defective SFV particles are used at a MOI varying from 25 to 100. Some adjustments may be required depending on the gene of interest. The number of cells infected correlates with the quantity of protein produced and the efficiency of protein secreted. For information, the best production we observed is for HCV envelope protein E2 (10). We produce approx 20 \u00b5g of purified protein per 107 cells infected at a MOI of 50.DC-SIGN- or L-SIGN-mediated viral internalization can also be investigated by confocal microscopy using purified viral glycoproteins (see\nNote 6) or whole virions. HeLa cells expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN (5 \u00d7 104 cells) are seeded on coverslips. The following day, cells are incubated with viral glycoproteins (5 \u00b5g/mL\u22121) or wild-type viruses diluted buffer B for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Cells are washed three times with ice cold PBS to remove unbound material and shifted to 37\u00b0C for different times to allow endocytosis. Cells are fixed with 3.2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed twice in PBS and treated with PBS 0.2 M glycine for 10 min. Cells are then incubated with 500 \u00b5L of PBS containing 0.05% saponin and 0.2% BSA for 30 min. Both DC-SIGN and viral protein trafficking can be followed by using specific mAb. Cells are mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a Zeiss microscope using a Plan Apochromat \u00d763/1.4 oil immersion objective.Optionally, the soluble glycoprotein can be purified by immuno-affinity when a tag peptide is introduced into its sequence. Several commercial tag peptides are available such as the Flag tag peptide which we used (10).Read-out is specific for the virus studied. We generally use wild-type viruses or viral particles carrying a reporter gene (GFP or Luc). For example, for HIV or HCV, we use single-cycle pseudotyped viral particles that are generated by co-transfecting 293T cells with an HIV-1 NL \u0394Env Luc or GFP (a HIV provirus lacking the Env gene and carrying the Luc or GFP gene in the place of Nef) and a cDNA plasmid encoding either HIV or HCV envelope proteins. Viral replication is evaluated by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates (3 d postinfection using a luciferase reporter assay kit [Promega] and a Victor luminometer [Perkin Elmer]) or by counting the GFP-positive cells by FACS. For dengue virus, cell are infected with viral particles produced in insect cells. Viral replication is quantified by flow cytometry 2 d after using Ab specific of dengue virus antigens. For more examples, see\nrefs.\n10,14,16,18,20\u201326,39.DC-SIGN- or L-SIGN-expressing cells used for infection in trans should not be infectable by the virus studied, to allow evaluation of virus replication that occurs uniquely in the target cell.\n",
