As very low bacterial co-infection is reported in COVID-19, we hypothesized that inflammation was virus-related. CRP levels were the best predictive biological factors associated with poor outcome. Despite no statistical relevance in our study, high ferritin levels have already been described as predictor of acute respiratory distress syndrome [5] . Recent studies found that decreased lymphocyte counts and increased D-dimer concentrations might be an indication of negative prognosis. In addition, several biomarkers such as decreased albumin levels as well as elevated creatine kinase levels and higher LDH levels were associated with poor outcome of COVID-19 [6] . For those patients, the therapeutic approach including antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, IL-6 blockers, IL-1 blockers) should be initiated to avoid ARDS [7] [8] [9] .
