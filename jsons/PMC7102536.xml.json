The causative pathogen is pseudorabies virus (PRV), which is a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae of the family Herpesviridae\n[1]. The genome of PRV is approximately 143 kb and encodes at least 70 open reading frames [2]. Although pigs are the natural host of PRV, other mammals, such as ruminants, carnivores and rodents, are susceptible to PRV infection [3]. PRV infection causes fatal fever and encephalomyelitis in pigs and susceptible animals [4]. PRV Bartha-K61 vaccines lacking virulence-determining genes are effective for prevention of morbidity of PRV infection in pigs. However, since 2011, this vaccine has exhibited less protective efficacy against virulent PRV variants in China. Therefore, new applications are urgently needed to control PRV spread.",

            "text": "The innate immune system has evolved as a first line of defense against virus infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that PRV infection can induce an innate immune response through cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that recognize PRV genomic DNA. Knockdown of DNA-dependent activator of interferon (IFN)-regulatory factors (DAI) inhibits IFN-\u03b2 expression and overexpression of DAI enhances IFN-\u03b2 expression in response to PRV infection [5]. Later, DEAD (Asp\u2013Glu\u2013Ala\u2013Asp) box polypeptide (DDX)41 was shown to participate in PRV infection [6]. DDX41 recognizes PRV genomic DNA and activates the type I IFN signaling pathway. Our previous study suggests that porcine cyclic GMP\u2013AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is also responsible for PRV-induced type I IFN activation [7]. The enzymatic activity of cGAS is activated by the binding between cGAS and PRV DNA. cGAS thereafter catalyzes the generation of cGAMP, an intrinsic second messenger that activates stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) to promote IFN expression dependent on the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate immune pathway. Contrary to cGAMP production by cGAS, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 can hydrolyze cGAMP to maintain homeostasis of the cGAMP reservoir and prevent IFN overactivation during PRV infection [8]. PRV can also evade IFN-mediated innate immune response to facilitate virus infection [9], suggesting that interaction of PRV and its host is complicated and obscure.",

            "text": "Upon activation by the innate immune pathways, IFNs bind to cell surface receptors and initiate a signaling cascade through the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK\u2013STAT) pathway, leading to the transcriptional regulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are highly effective at resisting and controlling pathogens [10], [11]. We previously found that porcine cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an ISG induced by either IFN or PRV infection [12]. CH25H catalyzes 25-hydroxycholesterol production to inhibit PRV entry. In addition, IFN-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a group of antiviral restriction factors that act against a broad range of viruses [13], such as influenza A virus [14], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 [15], West Nile virus and dengue virus [16], vesicular stomatitis virus [17], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Marburg virus [18], classical swine fever virus [19] and African swine fever virus [20]. The mechanisms by which IFITMs influence virus infection are restriction of viral entry, viral assembly or viral protein synthesis [21]. For example, IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 inhibit HIV-1 replication partially through interfering with virus entry [15]. However, which IFITM member is involved in PRV infection and how IFITMs influence PRV replication have not been documented.",

We performed a CCK-8 cell counting assay to identify whether pIFITM1 knockdown influenced cell proliferation. The proliferation of shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 cells was almost the same as PK15 and Scramble cells (Fig. 6\nA). We infected cells with PRV-QXX and performed a viral titration assay. In accordance with PRV-GFP, pIFITM1 knockdown enhanced PRV-QXX replication (Fig. 6B). To gain insight into the effect of pIFITM1 on PRV infection, we detected the growth kinetics of PRV-QXX in Scramble, shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 PK15 cells using a one-step growth curve. As indicated in Fig. 6C, viral yield was higher in shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 than in Scramble PK15 cells from 2 to 24 h post-infection. We examined PRV-QXX replication by immunoblotting of PRV gE, RT-qPCR of transcription of PRV glycoprotein B (gB), thymidine kinase (TK), and RT-qPCR of PRV-induced IFN-\u03b2, ISG15 and IL-1\u03b2 expression in PK15 cells with pIFITM1 knockdown. PRV gE expression was higher in shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 than in PK15 and Scramble cells (Fig. 6D). Transcription of PRV gB and TK was enhanced in cells due to pIFITM1 knockdown (Fig. 6E). PRV-induced IFN-\u03b2, ISG15 and IL-1\u03b2 expression was also increased in PK15 cells with pIFITM1 knockdown (Fig. 6F). These data demonstrate that knockdown of pIFITM1 promoted PRV-QXX infection in PK15 cells.",

A CCK-8 cell counting assay showed that proliferation of 3D4/21 cells was not altered by pIFITM1 knockdown (Fig. 7B). Subsequently, we infected Scramble, shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 3D4/21 cells with PRV-GFP and examined viral replication by fluorescent microscopy, FACS and viral titer assay. The percentage of GFP-positive cells was 33.72% in Scramble, and this rate significantly increased to 45.43% and 44.52% in shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 3D4/21 cells infected with PRV-GFP, respectively (Fig. 7C). Viral titer assay showed that PRV-GFP infection was enhanced in shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 compared with in Scramble 3D4/21 cells (Fig. 7D). We infected cells with PRV-QXX and found that viral titer was also higher in shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 than that in Scramble 3D4/21 cells (Fig. 7E). Additionally, we tested the growth kinetics of PRV-QXX in Scramble, shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 3D4/21 cells by one-step growth curve. Viral titration was higher in shIFITM1-1 and shIFITM1-2 than in Scramble 3D4/21 cells from 2 to 24 h post-infection, which was consistent with that in PK15 cells (Fig. 7F).

We demonstrate that pIFITM1 can be induced in PK15 and 3D4/21 cells, while pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 can be only induced in PK15 cells during PRV infection. The reason why PRV-induced pIFITM expression differs in PK15 and 3D4/21 cells needs further investigation. Lu et al. have examined the expression profile of IFITM in 32 rat tissues and show that IFITM1\u20133 were ubiquitously expressed [24]. IFITM1 and IFITM3 were also ubiquitously expressed in all the tissues examined in BALB/c mice. However, mice challenged with H9N2 avian influenza virus showed that the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM3 differ among tissues [25]. Further elucidation of the expression profile of IFITMs in porcine tissues will help us to understand the roles of IFITMs in pig infectious diseases.",

            "text": "The detection of cytosolic DNA as a \u2018stranger\u2019 and a \u2018danger\u2019 signal by DNA sensors has emerged as a key event in the innate immune response to virus infection [26]. A couple of DNA sensors have been identified to participate in innate immune response. The endoplasmic-reticulum-resident adaptor protein STING integrates DNA sensor-transduced signaling and subsequently activates the expression of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines [27]. DAI was the first putative DNA sensor to be shown to bind DNA, and to be required for the response to viral DNA [28], [29]. Using an RNAi screen of 59 members of the DExD/H helicase family, Zhang and colleagues identified DDX41 as a putative DNA sensor [30]. RNA polymerase III, IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 16, the high mobility group box proteins, and cGAS all play roles in sensing cytosolic DNA [31], [32], [33], [34]. We showed that PRV-induced pIFITM1 expression relied on the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate immune and IFN signaling pathways. Except for the activation of IFN, cGAMP also has a noncanonical function in inflammasome activation in human and mouse cells [35]. This may arm cells in another beneficial way to fight against PRV infection. DAI and DDX41 have been reported to respond to PRV infection [5], [6]; thus, it is possible that they are involved in PRV-induced pIFITM1 expression. Other DNA sensors may also be responsible for pIFITM1 expression when cells are infected with PRV. The predominant DNA sensor that is important for PRV-induced innate immune response may be determined by its expression profile in different cells and tissues.",

            "text": "We showed that pIFITM1 restricted PRV entry into host cells. The mechanism of how pIFITM1 restricts PRV entry may be due to the subcellular localization of IFITM1. IFITM1 mostly concentrates on the lipid raft and caveola in the plasma membrane and interacts with some membrane proteins such as CD19 and CD81 [36], [37], [38]. IFITM2 and IFITM3 are mainly in the intracellular compartments and co-localize with Rab7, CD63 and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 [39]. The C-terminal region of IFITM1 that controls protein subcellular localization is important for modulating the antiviral function against HIV entry [40]. Further studies have illustrated that the C-terminal KRXX motif of IFITM1 that interacts with adaptor protein complex 3 is responsible for its antiviral activity against jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus and 10A1 amphotropic murine leukemia virus [41]. It is also reported that IFITM1 inhibits viral entry and this antiviral function is associated with its cell surface localization [42]. IFITM1 may reduce membrane fluidity and increase spontaneous positive curvature in the outer leaflet of membranes [43], which may influence membrane fusion between PRV envelope and plasma membrane. Another mechanism by which pIFITM1 restricts PRV entry may be clathrin-mediated phagocytosis, because many viruses invade cells through a clathrin-dependent pathway [44]. Treatment of ifitm1\n\u2212/\u2212 cells with IFN-\u03b2 reduces the association of clathrin with membrane compartments, suggesting a molecular interaction between clathrin and IFITM1 [45]. Our multiple sequence alignment indicated that pIFITM1 lacks 20 amino acids in the NH2 terminus of pIFITM2 and pIFITM3. Jian et al. have shown that there is a sorting motif YEML, amino acids 20\u201323, for binding to the \u03bc2 subunit of the AP-2 complex in IFITM3 [46]. Although pIFITM1 lacks this sorting motif, we speculate that there may be other sorting motifs that mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis of IFITM1.",
