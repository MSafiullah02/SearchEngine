PcP has long been known for its high prevalence among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients [1]. Since the implementation of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) and chemoprophylaxis its incidence has been continuously decreasing [2]. Nowadays, most patients with HIV-associated PcP are treatment-na\u00efve with very low CD4 cell counts; some of these patients do not know that they are HIV positive until they attend hospital [3]. On the other hand, PcP is also frequently diagnosed in non-HIV-positive patients as immunosuppressive regimens are being increasingly used in a wide range of patient populations. Consistently, the incidence of PcP in non-HIV-positive patients is increasing [2].",

Although, most of these reports were published more than a decade ago and might not reflect the current epidemiological situation, a report from France was published a few years ago [9]. Roux et al. reported overall mortality of 17.4%, which was significantly higher in non-HIV-positive patients (27%) than in HIV-positive patients (4%) [9]. A few parameters such as age, prior episode of PcP, low CD4 cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and coinfections have been reported to predict unfavorable outcome in patients with HIV infection [10\u201312]. Reports on outcome predictors in non-HIV-positive patients are sparse.",

To obtain multivariable adjusted estimates, all main effects with univariate p values less than or equal to 0.15 were investigated simultaneously. In addition, confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with coverage of 95%. Finally, we also created receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for in-hospital death, which were summarized by area under the curve (AUC) estimates. ROC analyses were based on an increasingly complex (leave one out) logistic regression model with in-hospital mortality as the predicted outcome and the following predictors, which were all entered linearly: LDH alone, LDH + age, LDH + age + body mass index (BMI), and for LDH + age + BMI + estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). All reported p values are nominal and two-sided. In this explorative study, we applied a significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05 (two-sided).

Of the 240 patients with PcP, 41.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), with 36.6% in need of mechanical ventilation, 16.3% in need of renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 4.5% in need of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support (Fig. 2a). The overall in-hospital mortality was 25.4%. The mortality was 58% in patients requiring ICU treatment, 74.4% in patients requiring RRT and 81.8% in patients requiring ECMO support, and only 1.6% of patients died on regular (non-ICU) wards (Fig. 2b). Mortality during the observation time from 2000 to 2017 slightly fluctuated but did not trend toward an improvement in more recent years (Additional file 1: Figure S1B).",

Among the 224 patients treated with TMP-SMX, 159 (71%) were dosed in the recommended range above 15 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) per day, while 65 patients (29%) received a dose lower than 15 mg/kg BW (Additional file 1: Figure S5A).

A substantial group of our PcP cases (about 50%) were not related to HIV infections and these patients had a worse clinical course with higher ICU admission and mortality rates than patients with HIV-associated PcP. Three major non-HIV-positive groups were identified: (1) solid organ transplant recipients, (2) patients with malignancies and (3) patients with rheumatic diseases. PcP occurred almost exclusively in patients who did not receive chemoprophylaxis with TMP-SMX. Overall, about one quarter of all patients suffering from PcP did not survive the disease. In those who required intensive care (approximately 40% of all patients), the in-hospital mortality increased up to 58%. Based on the - in principle - reversible nature of PcP, almost no patients were denied intensive care in the event of acute respiratory failure, as the in-hospital mortality rate in non-ICU patients was 1.6%. Moreover, we found that the extent of initial LDH elevation was a predictor of in-hospital mortality, and that in univariate comparisons, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients whose TMP-SMX dose was below 15 mg/kg BW.",

Although observed in HIV-positive patients before [27], here we report for the first time that in a mixed population of HIV-positive and non-HIV-positive patients the initial levels of serum LDH at hospital admission are not only useful in the diagnostic evaluation [28] but may also be an independent predictor of survival. This might potentially help the clinician in early identification of the sickest patients at high risk of unfavorable outcome. With regard to the specificity/sensitivity, the ideal LDH cutoff value to predict outcome has yet to be defined.",
