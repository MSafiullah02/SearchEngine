Previous reports have highlighted areas of concern for patients requiring cardiac care during the COVID-19 outbreak, including delays in presentation and treatment.9 Our study shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with AHF often reported to the ED after significant clinical deterioration possibly due to several different barriers to appropriate care. Primary-care services have been overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, making it difficult to manage other healthcare needs, including the worsening of chronic conditions such as AHF.3\n,\n6 It would be important to know how patients with AHF were managed at home and their outcomes. However, these issues are beyond the scope of the current study. Patients with AHF may have been left without proper guidance that would have directed them to EDs sooner. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted most consolidated approaches to heart disease management, including AHF.6\n,\n9 Stakeholders should be aware that the risks of delayed access to hospital care for AHF could be even higher than those posed by COVID-19. Moreover, a significant re-engineering of healthcare services should be considered. The implementation of modern communication systems may overcome several emerging problems in the post-COVID-19 era.10 Online real\u2010time consultations with primary-care physicians and specialists may effectively circumvent the need for patient travel.",
