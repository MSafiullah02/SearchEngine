            "text": "Air environment control in hospitals has received increasing attention since the 2003's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics and due to the expected threat of influenza pandemic. There were various reports of large nosocomial SARS outbreaks [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], and some of them suggested the possible roles played by air environment in hospital wards. To minimize the cross-infection risk, engineering control methods were suggested in the so-called AII (airborne infection isolation) rooms [9]. The most well-known is the imbalanced mechanical ventilation system to achieve negative pressure relative to the corridor [9]. These mechanical negative pressure isolation rooms are expensive to build and operate, and the ventilation flow rate is limited to 12 air change/h [9]. Li et al. reviewed studies of ventilation and infections and found that there was lack of strong scientific evidence for recommending a minimum ventilation flow rate for infection control [10]. It is known that a higher ventilation rate is able to provide a higher dilution capability. However, use of higher ventilation rates also means a higher energy cost for mechanical ventilation. Alternative ventilation control systems have also been considered, e.g. when there is an immediate need for reconfiguring existing patient rooms to serve as airborne isolation rooms. Exhaust fans were installed in the windows of an air-conditioned ward to create negative pressure during the SARS epidemics [11], [12], [13], [14]. Temporary isolation rooms were also created during the SARS epidemic from the existing hospital wards.",

To our knowledge, Escombe et al. was the first recent publication of suggesting the use of natural ventilation for infection control with field measurement data [17], and a full paper was published in 2007 [18]. Natural ventilation was shown to be effective in reducing nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis in Peru, although no epidemiological data were available. This finding is not new as it was revealed more than 100 years ago that the outdoor treatment of tuberculosis might be more effective [19]. Jiang et al. also found that large ventilation windows in two hospital buildings reduced the infection risk by the healthcare workers during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Guangdong [20]. The ultimate acceptance of natural ventilation for isolation and infection control purposes will be helpful for creating temporary isolation room as the supplementary of standard isolation room when emergency infectious epidemic broke out. And it is hoped to be helpful for making isolation wards available to their patients with low costs in resource-limited countries [21].",

Generally, natural ventilation can provide a high ventilation rate more economically than mechanical ventilation, and its airflow and temperature are difficult to predict and control. However, modern natural ventilation is also a technology-dependent solution similar to mechanical systems. Unlike traditional natural ventilation systems, natural ventilation today depends on modern computer control system, modern design of ventilation openings, assisting fan design, etc. Thus, if properly designed, natural ventilation can also be reliable, in particular if combined with a mechanical system using the hybrid ventilation principle [22]. It should be mentioned here that the cost of hybrid and modern designed natural ventilation systems could be high for resource-limited countries, which is similar to those of mechanical ventilation system.",

There were exhaust fans installed in the doorway between the corridor and the ward, between the ward and the balcony, and also between the toilet and the ambient. One exhaust fan between the corridor and the ward was installed above the doorway and two exhaust fans were installed at the top of the windows to exhaust air from the ward to the outdoor. Outpatient clinic SYP is located in the Western District of Hong Kong Island surrounded by high buildings. The outpatient clinic includes consultation rooms and a waiting area.

This explained the difference in measured ventilation rates in Tests 4 and 17 which were carried out in a same ward; see Figs. 4(A) and (B). Fig. 4(B) shows the measured temperature, wind speed, and the direction from the Hong Kong observatory during the tests. Test 4 was done at 15:19\u201315:30 on November 9, 2005, when the wind speed and the wind direction were 3.6 m/s and 150\u00b0, respectively, at 15:00, and 2.4 m/s and 170\u00b0, respectively, at 16:00. Test 17 was done at 17:42\u201318:04 on August 28, 2006, when the wind speed and the direction were 4.1 m/s and 100\u00b0, respectively, at 17:00, and 4.8 m/s and 90\u00b0 at 18:00. In spite of that recorded wind speed during Test 17 being much higher than that during Test 4, the measured ventilation rate of Test 17 (18.5 ACH) was much lower than that of the ventilation rate of Test 4 (42.2 ACH). The reason is due to the wind direction; see Fig. 4(A). The angle between the wind direction and the tables and windows of Test 17 was less than 10\u00b0, while the angle of Test 4 was almost 75\u00b0. The effective wind speed flow to the windows was 3.0 \u00d7 sin(75\u00b0) = 2.9 m/s for Test 4, while the effective wind speed was less than 4.5 \u00d7 sin(10\u00b0) = 0.78 m/s. In the two tests, the experiment settings including the heat source inside the ward were set similar. Large ventilation rates make temperature in outdoor and indoor close, i.e. 0.019 \u00b0C in Test 4 and 0.87 \u00b0C in Test 17. So the wind dominates the ventilation rate in this test. So the results show the significance of wind speed and the wind direction to the ventilation rate.",

During measurement, it was found that the airflow pattern and the airflow direction were unstable, and bi-directional flows existed through an opening in Tests 1\u20134, 9\u201310, 15\u201317, 20, and 24\u201328. The pressure difference between the two openings was too small to be measured by our equipments when the windows and door were fully open. Strictly speaking, the pathogen-containing droplet residues are possible to escape from the ward to the corridor. However, the infection risk can be very low due to the existence of very high ventilation rate at the same time. Additionally, the use of exhaust fans may help us to avoid the infection risk as a design alternative. In Tests 7 and 18\u201320, all the exhaust fans were switched on. The airflow rate of the exhaust fans was found to differ when the doors and the windows were opened or closed. When all the fans were running and when all the openings were closed, the airflow rate for a fan was much lower than when all the openings were opened. The airflow rate of the fan to supply air from corridor to the ward was 160 l/s when all the openings were closed, while it was 80 l/s when all the openings were opened. And the airflow rate of fans to exhaust air from corridor to the balcony was 380 l/s when all the openings were closed, while it was 535 l/s when all the opening were open. It is due to the pressure difference. Negative pressure of the ward makes it easy to supply corridor air to the ward and difficult to exhaust ward air to the balcony.",

As we switched off the exhaust fan in the toilet and switched on the exhaust fans in the ward, the airflow would go from the toilet to the ward. It is of great importance to ensure that the toilet exhaust fan was switched on when the exhaust fans in the ward were turned on. When all the doors and the openings were closed and all the exhaust fans were switched on, the resulted pressure difference seemed satisfactory. Fans may also increase the ventilation rate and control the airflow direction. It is useful for the worst weather conditions. The results indicate that the natural ventilated ward could alter to a temporary mechanical isolation room if the electric fans were properly designed and installed.",

First, the ventilation rate delivered by natural ventilation may be very high for most of the period, but may be low when the natural forces are not available. This may be resolved by a better design of natural ventilation. If the resources are available, natural ventilation may be designed together with mechanical ventilation so that the latter can function when the natural forces are not available. Second, as traditionally believed, negative pressure is needed for airborne precaution and natural ventilation cannot control the airflow direction through the doorway. This may not be an issue when the quanta generation rate is not extremely high as discussed below. It may be argued that when the ventilation rate is double or triple the minimum 12 ACH recommended by CDC, the infection risk would be significantly reduced. Third, the natural ventilation cannot control the thermal comfort conditions when the outdoor air is hot and humid, as experienced in the Hospital GH. Through their many years experience operating natural ventilation for their TB wards, they have learned to use spot air conditioning and ceiling fans for achieving better thermal comfort for their patients.",

This means that in the case of extremely high quanta generation, a correct airflow direction is important in avoiding the leakage of the pathogens-laden droplet nuclei into the public areas such as corridors. Literatures show that airborne transmitted diseases have the possibility to transmit in vertical direction, i.e. transmit between different floors in a high rise residential building due to buoyancy effects [25], [26]. So the route of vertical transmission of airborne transmitted diseases should be taken into account in controlling airborne infection. In natural ventilation, it is not easy to control its airflow direction. In some locations, prevailing wind direction may be used in the design for airflow-direction control. It may be argued that the cases with extremely high quanta generation may be exceptional. In any case, this may be one of the situations when the natural ventilation may not be effective. However, in this case, natural ventilation may reduce but not eliminate the risk of infection, and appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) such as use of masks is recommended.",
