            "text": "Viral enteropathogens that are mainly reported in dogs consist of canine parvovirus (CPV) (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012) and coronavirus (CCoV) (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2011), although other agents have been traditionally related to enteric disease, such as canine distemper virus (CDV) (Martella et al., 2008a), canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1) (Decaro et al., 2008a), rotaviruses (Eugster and Sidwa, 1979), reoviruses (Kokubu et al., 1993), caliciviruses (Mochizuki et al., 1993), including noroviruses (Martella et al., 2008b) and sapoviruses (Li et al., 2011), astroviruses (Martella et al., 2012) and kobuviruses (Li et al., 2011, Di Martino et al., 2013). More recently, dog circovirus (CanineCV) has been reported in diarrheal dogs from several countries (Li et al., 2013, Decaro et al., 2014, Hsu et al., 2016, Thaiwong et al., 2016). Circoviruses (family Circoviridae, genus Circovirus) are non-enveloped spherical viruses with a small monomeric single-stranded circular DNA of approximately 2 kb in length (Kapoor et al., 2012). Currently, the genus Circovirus consists of a number of species detected in domestic and wild birds, and some mammalian species, including two swine viruses, Porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1) and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2). Infections with either porcine or avian circoviruses are characterised by clinical courses that may vary from asymptomatic infections to lethal disease. In pigs, PCV-1 completely lacks any pathogenic role and single infections with PCV-2 rarely conduct to severe clinical disease. However, concurrent infections with other viruses or bacteria have been demonstrated to enhance PCV-2 replication in target tissues, increasing the severity of the induced lesions and the clinical course (Opriessnig and Halbur, 2012). CanineCV has been firstly reported in serum samples from dogs with no clinical history (Kapoor et al., 2012). Subsequent reports suggest that CanineCV is circulating in dogs, causing haemorrhages (Li et al., 2013) or severe gastroenteritis (Decaro et al., 2014, Zaccaria et al., 2016). However, the exact role of this virus in the development of clinical disease is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of CanineCV with gastroenteritis in dogs, alone or with other viral pathogens.",

            "text": "A case-control study was conducted over two subsets of dogs, selected on the basis of the presence of acute gastroenteric signs for clinical cases and the absence of gastroenteritis for controls. Samples were collected between 2013 and 2016 from dogs presenting at the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Bari, Italy, as well as from diagnostic laboratories, private practitioners, animal shelters, commercial dog brokers and breeding kennels. A total of 219 patients suffering from gastrointestinal disorders were enrolled, considering as inclusion criteria the presence of mild to severe disease. Control subjects (n\n = 67) were randomly recruited among both healthy dogs or patients presenting without clinical signs of gastroenteritis and matching with cases for age and living conditions, in order to avoid statistically significant differences between the two subsets of animals. Dogs of 1 year of age or older were classified as adults, accordingly to pet food industry standard categorisation (n\n \n=\n 37 for cases, 16.9%; n\n \n=\n 11 for controls, 16.4%), whereas dogs younger than 1 year were considered young or puppies, including in the study only dogs older than 1 month (n\n \n=\n 182 for cases, 83.1%; n\n = 56 for controls, 83.6%). The sampled dogs were client-owned (n\n \n=\n 159 for cases, 72.6%; n\n = 52 for controls, 77.6%) or shelter dogs (n\n \n=\n 60 for cases, 27.4%; n\n = 15 for controls, 22.4%), representing different living conditions. Ages of the selected animals, along with clinical data and vaccination records, were collected in order to correctly support the inclusion criteria adopted and provide elements for further analyses. The presence of CanineCV, CPV, CCoV and CDV was investigated in all samples by molecular assays and further characterisation of the positive samples was carried out for each pathogen, as subsequently described. Finally, statistical analysis was performed in order to investigate the possible interaction among the viruses detected.",

TaqMan and MGB probe assays were performed on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl) with iTaq Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl, Milan, Italy). Samples were considered positive if the amplification curves were higher than the threshold line generated by the software on the basis of the background fluorescence. Briefly, specific detection of CanineCV was carried out following the method proposed by Li et al. (2013), with minor modifications. Detection of CPV was primarily carried out by a generic TaqMan assay able to detect all carnivore protoparvoviruses (Decaro et al., 2005a). Samples that tested positive were further characterised by means of a panel of MGB probe assays able to discriminate between CPV/feline panleukopenia virus, CPV-2a/2b, CPV-2b/2c and CPV vaccine/field viruses (Decaro et al., 2006a, Decaro et al., 2006b, Decaro et al., 2008b). The specificity and sensitivity of all molecular assays used in the study had been previously calculated (Decaro et al., 2005a, Decaro et al., 2006a, Decaro et al., 2006b, Decaro et al., 2008b). Similarly, screening of all samples for CCoV and CDV was performed through previously established TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assays (Decaro et al., 2004, Elia et al., 2006). For CDV, samples resulted positive were characterised using a discriminative hemi-nested PCR (Martella et al., 2007). RT-PCR and PCR assays were performed using Superscript\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates (Life Technologies, Monza, Italy) and LA PCR Kit Ver 2.1 (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), respectively. Samples were considered positive if amplicons of the expected size were visualised after gel electrophoresis on an imaging system (Gel Doc\u2122 EZ System with Image Lab software, Bio-Rad Laboratories).",

Several studies have demonstrated the presence of CCoV in the faeces of dogs with diarrhoea in different countries, usually related to mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis (Decaro et al., 2005b, Decaro et al., 2011, Stavisky et al., 2012, Cavalli et al., 2014, Costa et al., 2014, Licitra et al., 2014), although occasional detection of a hyper-virulent CCoV variant, referred to as pantropic CCoV, has been reported in severe, often fatal outbreaks (Buonavoglia et al., 2006, Decaro et al., 2013, Ntafis et al., 2012, Zicola et al., 2012, Pinto et al., 2014). The role of CCoV as enteropathogen has been recently reconsidered by Duijvestijn et al. (2016) that reported a strong association between diarrhoea and CCoV infection (p\n = 0.001) and results from our study also support this relation (p <\n 0.0001).",

            "text": "CanineCV was strongly associated to the occurrence of enteric disease only in co-infections with other, well-recognised pathogens (CPV or CCoV). While previous reports accounted for a primary role of CanineCV in the development of clinical disease (Li et al., 2013, Decaro et al., 2014), subsequent studies suggested that this virus can act as entheropathogen mainly when associated to other pathogens (Hsu et al., 2016, Thaiwong et al., 2016, Zaccaria et al., 2016). Our study has shown a high frequency of detection of CanineCV in diarrheal dogs (32.42%), similar to that reported in a recent study from China (28%) (Hsu et al., 2016) but greater with respect to a previous survey conducted in USA (11.3%) (Li et al., 2013) and to two very recent studies conducted in Germany (20.1%, Gentil et al., 2017; 3.64%, Anderson et al., 2017). However, in one of these German surveys (Anderson et al., 2017), the target canine population was quite different from that included in the present study, since it was represented by dogs displaying only haemorrhagic diarrhoea, while in our study non-haemorrhagic gastroenteritis was also considered. The CanineCV prevelance was higher in CPV-infected dogs (12.96%), thus confirming the role of this emerging virus as co-pathogen in the occurrence of acute gastroenteritis. In our study, CanineCV was also detected in dogs with no history of gastrointestinal signs, which displayed a virus prevalence comparable to that observed in the cases (28.35%). Consequently, no significant association was evident between single CanineCV infections and occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p = 0.530988).",

This accounts either for a low viral replication in the intestinal mucosa, as a consequence of long-term infections, or for virus passage in the gut lumen without active replication. Accordingly, previous studies detected higher viral titres in internal organs than in the faeces of CanineCV infected animals (Zaccaria et al., 2014). Therefore, the potential role of CanineCV in the occurrence of extra-intestinal disease deserves to be investigated in future studies. A neurologic tropism has been suggested for circoviruses in foxes (Bexton et al., 2015), while the ability of PCV-2 to spread systemically has been reported in swine (Opriessnig et al., 2007). CPV and CCoV interact at the gut level enhancing their pathogenicity (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2011) and the prolonged depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes induced by the pantropic CCoV variant impairs the immune response of infected pups (Marinaro et al., 2010). Analogous to CPV/CCoV co-infections, a possible synergism between CPV and CanineCV may be hypothesised, so that CanineCV may exacerbate the clinical course of concurrent enteric infections through replication in the enteric epithelium, impairment of the immune response or both.",
