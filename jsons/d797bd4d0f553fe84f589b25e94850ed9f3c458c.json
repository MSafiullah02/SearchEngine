            "text": "A novel coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China has led to major outbreaks. Recently, rapid classification of virus species, analysis of genome and screening for effective drugs are the most important tasks. In the present study, through literature review, sequence alignment, ORF identification, motif recognition, secondary and tertiary structure prediction, the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 were comprehensively analyzed. To find effective drugs, the parameters of binding sites were calculated by SeeSAR. In addition, potential miRNAs were predicted according to RNA base-pairing. After prediction by using NCBI, WebMGA and Gene-Mark and comparison, a total of 8 credible ORFs were detected. Even the whole genome have great difference with other CoVs, each ORF has high homology with SARS-CoVs (>90%). Furthermore, domain composition in each ORFs was also similar to SARS. In the DrugBank database, only 7 potential drugs were screened based on the sequence search module. Further predicted binding sites between drug and ORFs revealed that 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid could bind 1# ORF in 4 different regions ideally. Meanwhile, both benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate and 4-(dimehylamina) benzoic acid have bene demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV infection effectively. Interestingly, 2 miRNAs (miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p) were predicted to prevent virus replication via targeting 3 0 -UTR of the genome or as biomarkers. In conclusion, the novel coronavirus may have consanguinity with SARS. Drugs used to treat SARS may also be effective against the novel virus. In addition, altering miRNA expression may become a potential therapeutic schedule.",

            "text": "CoVs belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. The genome of CoVs is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (\u00fessRNA) (~30 kb) with 5 0 -cap structure and 3 0 -poly-A tail. 6 The genomic RNA is used as a template to directly translate polyprotein (pp) 1a/1 ab, the non-structural proteins (nsps) to form a replication-transcription complex (RTC) in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). 7 Subsequently, a set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are synthesized by RTC in a discontinuous transcription manner. 8 Genomes and subgenomes of CoVs contain at least 6 open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF1a/b), about 2/3 of genome length, encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16). These polypeptides will be processed into 16 nsps by virally encoded protease. 9, 10 Hydrophobic transmembrane domains are present in nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 in order to anchor the nascent pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins to membranes once RTC formation. Other ORFs on the 1/3 genome near 3 0 terminus encodes at least 4 main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides these 4 main structural proteins, different CoVs encode special structural and accessory proteins, such as 3a/b protein. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs RNAs of CoVs. 8 In addition, a 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) and 3 0 -UTR were also identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Thus, studies about microRNA might be necessary and significant. Furthermore, a number of cellular proteins have been shown to interact with CoVs RNA. These include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, polypyrimidine tract binding protein, poly (A)binding protein, and mitochondrial aconitase. 11 Understanding of the genome-structure-function correlation in SARS-CoV-2 is important for the identification of potential anti-viral inhibitors and vaccine targets.",

The whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512, 29903bp ssRNA) provided by Dr. Zhang was recorded by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). We estimated phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole genome sequence (Fig. 1) . The alignment result suggested that there is a significant difference between the whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs. Even the most homologous species just have less than 90% repetitive sequence (Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21, complete genome). Furthermore, the result displayed that SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are distantly related (<82.34%). It may conclude that the new virus is not evolved directly from SARS, but we cannot deny that there is a potential relation between the two viruses. As well known, once the virus infects the host, the genetic material leaves the capsid followed by replicates and assembles. Since the presence of subgenome in CoVs, the genome of new assembled CoVs might be changed. Address this issue, the phylogenetic trees of every main ORF should be constructed. By prediction of ORFs in 3 mainstream databases (NCBI, GeneMark and WebMGA), a total of 15 ORFs were identified ( Fig. 2A and B) . Interestingly, at the position from 266 to 21555, each database predicts a different outcome. What's more, the most important non-structural protein orf1a/b was encoded based on this sequence.

To confirm the structure and function of polypeptide chains encoded by each ORF, the secondary and tertiary structure of polypeptide were predicted (Fig. 3A, B and S1 ). In 1#ORF, 21 positions of transmembrane helix were identified (643e657; 700e716; 1723e1739; 1758e1773; 2219e2235; 2276e2310; 2379e2409; 2414e2438; 2822e2846; 3090e3118; 3127e3152; 3172e3202; 3630e3658; 3662e3676; 3684e3711; 3732e3750; 3758e3772; 3794e3822; 3826e3853; 3916e3932; 3961e3976); 3 helixes in 2#ORF (50e74; 748e762; 1275e1299); 3 helixes in 3#ORF (85e112; 126e151; 156e180); 4 helixes in 4#ORF (67e89; 97e121; 127e152; 184e200); 1 helix in 5#ORF (54e74); 2 helixes in 6#ORF (52e67; 146e167); 1 helix in 7#ORF (52e67) and no helix was detected in 8#ORF. The polypeptides with transmembrane helix may play role in virus infection and the transmembrane domains can be recognized by the immune system. They are good candidates for inclusion in viral vaccines. Subsequently, based on the recorded protein templates in the RCSB PDB database, homology modeling of each polypeptide was performed in SWISS-MODEL. Particularly in the modeling of 3# polypeptide, 3 subunits assemble into a protein named Spike protein (S protein) in other CoVs. S protein was often regarded as the most important structural element play a significant role in antigen recognition. When homology modeling of these 8 polypeptides, only 1#, 2#, 6# and 8# polypeptide could be matched to similar templates (seq identity\uff1e90%) while the others cannot match a template with credible identity (\uff1e30%). The result may signify 3#, 4#, 5# and 7# polypeptides may fold into novel proteins. The function of polypeptide and mature protein not only depends on secondary structure and tertiary structure. The domains constituted by specific amino acid sequences are also crucial. Therefore, the main domains in each ORFs were predicted via the SMART database ( Fig. 3C and Table  2 ). In the predicted result, it was identified that some domains play key roles in entry into the host cell like Spi-ke_rec_bind domain in 2# ORF (Spike protein). Once CoVs infected host, immune response appeared. Thus, the prediction of epitopes, the parts of antigens interacting with receptors of the immune system are important for understanding viral diseases and finding anti-viral targets. The top3 B cell-linear and discontinuous epitopes of each polypeptide have been shown ( Figure S2e9 ).",

To achieve the purpose of treatment in the shortest possible time, screening existing drugs is more practical than designing new ones. According to amino acid sequence searching result of each polypeptide, only 1# polypeptide could be bound with the 7 known drugs ( Figure S10 ). To further verify the ability of drug binding with peptide, 5 binding regions were detected by SeeSAR software ( Figure S11 ). Via calculated affinities, phys-chem properties, torsional 'heat' and explorable space, a comprehensive analysis of the binding capacity of each drug with a specific binding region was performed (Fig. 4) . It was shown that (2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid could bind with No. 1, 2, 3 and 5 regions with a set of desired parameters. Both 4-(dimethylamino) benzoic acid and benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate could bind with all regions even without ideal parameters. All 7 drugs were tried to be used for curing SARS, but the efficacy and mechanism are still uncertain.",

In the miRBase database, through sequence prediction, miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p may bind to 3 0 -UTR of SARS-CoV-2s. Interestingly, previous studies have detected in lung cancer patients, both miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p were downregulated significantly. 35, 36 Furthermore, it was demonstrated tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) could upregulate miR-1307-3p which were used to treat non-small cell lung cancer 37 \u3002In conclusion, both 2 miRNAs can not only become drug target, they can also be regarded as biomarkers in checking of viral pneumonia.",

Thus, if there some existing drugs could be authenticated therapeutic, it will greatly improve the prognosis of patients. A total of 7 drugs were predicted to bind with 1# polypeptide. Notably, the 1# polypeptide could form the replicase polyprotein 1a (ORF1a). 38 Normally, ORF1a and ORF1b (transcriptase) often form a heterodimer (ORF1ab) which may serve specific roles in virulence, virus-cell interactions and alterations of defense response. In ORF1a, the detailed analysis revealed evidence of adaptive mutations exceeded structural proteins. 39 For example, the ORF1a polyprotein showed a rate of nonsynonymous substitutions similar to that in the S gene. Among the screened drugs, the 2-(Nmorpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid has the best binding efficiency with ORF1a through the 3D structural fitting. Unfortunately, this hypothesis lacks enough evidence. Furthermore, 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid is known as a component of crystallization buffer. Such buffer molecules including Tris, Hepas, glycerinum, DMSO and water usually appear in crystal structures but make no sense for drug discovery of virus. Thus, though the predicted results of 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid were ideal, it dose not mean 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid own effective virus suppression. In contrast, both benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate and 4-(dimehylamina) benzoic acid have bene demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV infection effectively. 40, 41 Strangely, the 2-[(2,4-dichloro-5-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]-1,3-dinitro-5-(trifluoromrthyl) benzene could not bind with any region in 1# polypeptide which may be caused by 2 reasons: 1, It has bigger molecular weight and a more complicated structure, results in a lower affinity with the polypeptide. 2, there are 2 chlorine atoms in this drug which might lead to a weakened recognized ability between drug and peptide chain.",
