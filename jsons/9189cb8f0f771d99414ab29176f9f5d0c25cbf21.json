The symptoms are diverse, ranging from tremor, nystagmus, paralysis, and disturbances in speech and vision. Extensive demyelination is seen in the neuronal lesions. The clinical heterogeneity of MS, as well as the finding of different pathological patterns, suggests that MS may be a spectrum of diseases that may represent different pathological processes. 1 This has led to the development of many different animal models, including rodents and nonhuman primates, that reflect the pathological processes and could allow for the development of therapeutic approaches. At the present time, the exact etiological mechanism in humans is not clear; however, several animal models are available providing insight into disease processes. The relative inaccessibility and sensitivity of the central nervous system (CNS) in humans preclude studies on disease pathogenesis, and so much of our understanding of infections and immune responses has been derived from experimental animal models. The experimental systems include Theiler's virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and Semliki Forest virus infections of laboratory rodents. Additional information has been obtained from studies of experimental infections of other animals that result in demyelination, notably maedi-visna virus in sheep and canine distemper virus in dogs. In humans and animals, most natural cases of demyelinating disease are rare complications of viral infections. One possible reason for the low incidence of demyelination following viral infections could be the low efficiency of neuroinvasion.

There are two main strains of TMEV, the virulent strains and persistent Theiler's original (TO) strains. The virulent GDVII strains of Theiler's virus are highly neurovirulent and when injected intracranially, cause death by encephalitis within 48 h. GDVII strains also cause differing forms of paralysis depending on the route of inoculation (see Table 69 -1). From these studies it appears that the GDVII virus may gain access to the CNS by retrograde axonal transport rather than by a hematogeneous route. 5 Infection of susceptible strains of mice with the persistent TO strains BeAn, DA, WW, or Yale results in a primary demyelinating disease that closely resembles human MS. 6 Infection of resistant strains of mice with BeAn does not result in demyelinating disease, since these mice are able to clear virus from the CNS. Susceptible mice fail to clear virus from the CNS, possibly resulting from poor natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Persistent viral infection of the CNS is required for demyelination. Following the intracranial injection of susceptible mice with BeAn, virus replicates both in the brain and spinal cord. 7 One month postinfection, viral titers decrease, and high levels of neutralizing antibodies are detected (Figure 69-1) . At this point in the disease, neurons may become infected with virus and mice may develop a nonprogressive flaccid paralysis of the forelimbs and/or hindlimbs. 8 This is sometimes referred to as a polio-like disease, but this is confusing since flaccid paralysis in mice infected with poliovirus is progressive and normally results in death. In the late phase of the disease, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and macrophage/microglial cells become infected with virus.

The virus infects oligodendrocytes, and the resulting demyelinating disease could be due, in part, to the virus killing oligodendrocytes directly or by the virus-specific CD8 + CTLs present in the lesions. 7 A series of experiments has demonstrated that demyelination correlates with the presence of a CD4 + T cell-mediated response against viral epitopes. These cells secrete cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 that activate both microglial cells and invading monocytes, which subsequently secrete factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and thus can cause \"bystander\" demyelination. Activated macrophages ingest and degrade damaged myelin. Autoantibodies 12,13 and myelin-specific CD4 + T cells have been shown in SJL/J mice several months after intracranial inoculation. 14, 15 Epitope spreading in these mice commences with recognition of a proteolipid protein (PLP) epitope, and then progresses to additional PLP epitopes and then to myeloid basic protein (MBP) epitopes. 14 A direct demonstration that disease can be maintained on a purely autoimmune footing, after infection has been eradicated, has not been shown. IMMUNITY AND THEILER'S VIRUS The first response to viral infection is the production of type I interferons, which are critical for viral clearance. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout mice injected with TMEV die of encephalomyelitis within 10 days of infection. NK cells are activated early in infection with certain viruses. In TMEV infection susceptible SJL mice have a 50% lower NK cell activity in comparison to the highly resistant C57BL/6 mice. This low NK activity in SJL mice is in part due to a defect in the thymus impairing the responsiveness of NK cells to stimulation by IFN-\u03b2. The pivotal role of NK cells in early TMEV clearance is demonstrated by the finding that resistant mice depleted of NK cells by monoclonal antibodies to NK 1.1 develop severe signs of gray matter disease. 16 In the early disease, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been shown to be important in viral clearance. In early disease CD4 + T cells are required for B cells to produce antibodies for viral clearance. 12 These CD4 + T cells secrete IFN-\u03b3, which in vitro inhibits TMEV replication and has a protective role in vivo. CD8 + T cells are also important in viral clearance, as demonstrated by the finding that CD8 + T cell-depleted mice fail to clear virus and develop a more severe demyelinating disease. 17 CD8 + T cells also provide protection against TVID when adoptively transferred to a TVID-susceptible strain, BALB/c.AnNCr.

High levels of the proinfl ammatory Th1 cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in late disease correlate well with maximal disease activity. Evidence demonstrating the protective role of Th2 in TVID has been shown in experiments in which skewing the immune response toward Th2 immunity in TMEV infection diminishes the later demyelinating disease. 19 However, other studies have shown that the Th1/Th2 balance did not explain the difference in susceptibility to TVID.

To date, however, there are few reliable data on the frequency of remyelination in MS patients. Stimulation of remyelination is a potential treatment for MS. The TMEV model of MS can be used to study remyelination using remyelinationpromoting antibodies. In this remyelination model, SJL/J mice, aged 4-8 weeks, are injected with a 10 \u00b5l volume containing 200,000 pfu of Daniel strain intracerebrally. All animals develop mild encephalitis, which resolves within 14 days after the injection. The infected mice then develop the chronic demyelinating disease that gradually progresses over several months. To study remyelination, mice that had been infected with TMEV for 6 months receive a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg (\u223c0.025 g/kg body weight) of a recombinant remyelinating antibody (rHIgM22) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 21 In one study, 82.8% of lesions in animals treated with rHIgM22 showed retraction of varying degrees, presumably the effect of remyelination in these lesions. The direct binding of rHIgM22 to demyelinated lesions is consistent with the hypothesis that these antibodies work directly in the lesions, probably by binding to the CNS glia to induce remyelination.

Both of these strains are avirulent in neonatal and suckling mice by all routes of infection. Experimental infection of mice with SFV is widely used as a model to study the mechanism of virus-induced CNS disease.

This fi nding is analogous to that in MS and is in contrast to that in EAE, where CD4 + cells predominate. 42 In the EAE autoimmune model of MS, studies suggest that a Th1 cytokine profile predominates. Another point of difference between the EAE model and the SFV model is shown in the Th1/Th2 profiles. Following infection with SFV, Th1 and Th2 cytokines were detected in the CNS and both were present throughout the time course studied, indicating that there was no bias of Th response in the CNS, nor were changes apparent with time. 43 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 623, "end": 625, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 785, "end": 786, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1000, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1431, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SEMLIKI FOREST VIRUS"}, {"text": "The experimental disease EAE has been investigated in many strains of animals including mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, marmosets, and rhesus monkeys.

Many mouse strains have been employed in the study of EAE, and while the SJL strain has been most frequently used to model gender differences in both disease onset and severity, the SJL model has some limitations due to its diminished CD4 + T cell repertoire. Certain susceptible strains of mice, such as FVB mice, show a relapsing-remitting course of disease that bears some resemblance to MS. FVB mice therefore may serve as a mouse strain into which various transgenes may be introduced for the purpose of studying their influence on EAE and for exploring new therapeutic approaches. 61 Since EAE is a well-studied disease in mice, mimicking many clinical and pathological features of MS, including CNS infl ammation and demyelination, it is of significance that it can also be used as an appropriate model to study MS-related pain. It has been clearly demonstrated in SJL that in both \"active\" and \"passive\" EAE, there is an initial increase in tail withdrawal latency (hypoalgesia) that peaked several days prior to the peak in motor defi cits during the acute disease phase. During the chronic disease phase, tail withdrawal latencies decreased and were significantly faster than control latencies for up to 38 days postimmunization.

This conflict may in part be due to the model systems used as well as the poor correlation of in vitro findings compared to those observed in vivo.

In CREAE in ABH mice, relapse and progression of disease are associated with emergence and broadening of the immune repertoire due to release of myelin antigens following myelin damage. 64 Thus, this CREAE model in Biozzi ABH mice is very well suited as a model with which to examine the effect of therapeutic strategies in a dynamic system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 480, "end": 482, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1766, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2511, "end": 2513, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3176, "end": 3178, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 3540, "end": 3542, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN MICE"}, {"text": "Disease susceptibility in human MS is associated with three MHC class II alleles in the HLA-DR2 haplotype, DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101, and DQB1*0602. 65 An autoimmune pathogenesis has been hypothesized in which one or more of these MHC class II molecules presents CNS-derived self-antigens to autoaggressive CD4 + T cells, which infiltrate the CNS initiating an infl ammatory response. However, the target autoantigens in MS are unknown. Immunization of mice with myelin or other brainassociated proteins induces EAE, a disease resembling MS both clinically and pathologically. The proteins, MBP, PLP, and MOG, components of the myelin sheath, are candidate antigens. 66 Indeed, T cells that are reactive to these antigens have been demonstrated in MS patients. 67 Mice expressing the human HLA-DR2 (DRB1*1501) molecule are capable of presenting peptides from all these three MS candidate autoantigens. It is possible in MS that while T cells responding to one of these antigens may initiate the disease, epitope spreading and the recruitment of T cells with additional specificities, as the disease progresses, could lead to infl ammatory responses to several proteins resulting in an escalation of the autoimmune response. 68 Transgenic mouse models of multiple sclerosis are now well established. The following are two examples of such transgenic models. First, MS is associated with HLA class II molecules HLA-DR2, -DR3, and -DR4. In humans it is difficult to analyze the individual roles of HLA molecules in disease pathogenesis due to the heterogeneity of MHC genes, linkage disequilibrium, the influence of non-MHC genes, and the contribution of environmental factors. However, the specific roles of each of these class II molecules can be addressed using transgenic models expressing these HLA genes. This model could prove useful in deciphering the role of HLA molecules and autoantigens in MS. 69 Second, while EAE has been a valuable model for the immunopathogen-esis of MS, it has sometimes been difficult to reconcile the fi ndings and therapies in the rodent models and the cellular and molecular interactions that can be studied in human disease. Humanized transgenic mice offer a means of achieving this, through the expression of disease-implicated HLA class II molecules, coexpressed with a cognate HLA-class II-restricted, myelin-specifi c T cell receptor derived from a human T cell clone implicated in disease. Such transgenic mice could provide an excellent model for studying epitope spreading in a humanized immunogenetic environment and for testing of immunotherapies. 70", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 146, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 662, "end": 664, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 756, "end": 758, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1221, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1900, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN MICE"}, {"text": "The majority of the current therapies being planned for phase II and III trials in MS were first examined in EAE.

For demyelination studies with LPC, male Wistar rats are anesthetized with sodium pentathal and fixed in a rat head restraining stereotaxic surgical table, head shaved, a burr hole created, and 0.2 \u00b5l of a 1% LPC solution in isotonic saline injected using an injector cannula. Then LPC is infused at the rate of 0.05 \u00b5l/min for the next 4-5 min. The cannula is then removed and the burr hole closed using bone wax. Rats are then observed daily and histological studies are carried out from day 3 to day 15 after LPC injection to cover the entire process of disease evolution. 76 Using this LPC-induced demyelination it is possible to observe the complete pathological process of demyelination and remyelination in this animal model of MS. Demyelination can be observed with the maximum value occurring on day 10. After day 10, remyelination starts with a reduction in edema. This model could be particularly useful for studying remyelination. One prominent feature of all chemically induced lesions is that the demyelinating lesions, and subsequent remyelination, can be studied without the interference of immune mechanisms. This has a tremendous advantage over virally induced models of MS: since no virus was inoculated none can remain to affect the remyelination.
