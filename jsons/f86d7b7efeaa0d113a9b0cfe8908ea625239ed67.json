Materials and methods A total of 122 patients (61 men and 61 women, 48 \u00b1 15 years) confirmed with COVID-19 and 48 patients (23 men and 25 women, 47 \u00b1 19 years) confirmed with influenza were enrolled in the study. Thin-section CT was performed. The clinical data and the chest CT findings were recorded. Results The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever (74%) and cough (63%), and 102 patients (83%) had Wuhan contact. Pneumonia in 50 patients with COVID-19 (45%) distributed in the peripheral regions of the lung, while it showed mixed distribution in 26 patients (74%) with influenza (p = 0.022). The most common CT features of the COVID-19 group were pure ground-glass opacities (GGO, 36%), GGO with consolidation (51%), rounded opacities (35%), linear opacities (64%), bronchiolar wall thickening (49%), and interlobular septal thickening (66%). Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have rounded opacities (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.048) and interlobular septal thickening (66% vs. 43%, p = 0.014), but less likely to have nodules (28% vs. 71%, p < 0.001), tree-in-bud sign (9% vs. 40%, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (6% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). Conclusions There are significant differences in the CT manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and influenza. Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza.",

            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV) pneumonia began in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China). The COVID-19 spread rapidly across China and many other countries. As of January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated this outbreak as a global health emergency. By April 1, 2020, 823,626 confirmed cases and 40,598 death cases have been officially reported by the WHO [1] . Respiratory droplets and direct contact are likely to be the most important routes of transmission [2, 3] . Therefore, early diagnosis and isolation becomes essential against novel coronavirus. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the reference standard to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. However, more and more false negative RT-PCR results have been reported recently [4, 5] , making the diagnosis rather challenging. Currently, chest CT is one of the best tools for screening, primary diagnosis, estimation of disease severity, and prediction of the prognosis.",

Recent studies showed that typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal groundglass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, with a peripheral lung distribution [6, 7] . However, the CT features of COVID-19 are very diverse, and it is difficult to differentiate it from other kinds of viral pneumonia. Recently, Bai et al compared the chest CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and found that COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution and ground-glass opacity [8] . However, there are several kinds of respiratory tract viruses that may lead to viral pneumonia, and the CT features of the different kinds of viral pneumonia may be different [9] . Influenza pneumonia is among the most common viral pneumonia, and now it is just during the \"flu season\"; therefore, it is essential to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from influenza. Herein, we described and summarized the chest CT findings of 122 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 48 patients with influenza, and tried to explore the radiological differentiation between the two groups.",

However, a considerable portion of patients with Wuhan contact were finally diagnosed with influenza or bacterial pneumonia in our hospital. Therefore, the etiological tests of other pathogens of the respiratory tract are needed for the patients with negative PCR for COVID-19. The total positive rate of initial RT-PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be about 30 to 60% [10] . Xie et al found positive CT findings on patients with COVID-19 who had negative initial RT-PCR [4] . In addition, the sensitivity of chest CT was reported to be greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs. 71%) [11] . Therefore, chest CT differentiation was of high importance. However, patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 may have normal CT findings at admission [12] , and thus, a normal CT scan cannot rule out the diagnosis. Therefore, the combination of chest CT and RT-PCR is necessary for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We have confirmed in the present study that the lesion distribution of the two diseases has much in common.",

However, the COVID-19 group mainly involved peripheral part of the lung, which was in line with other coronavirus infection such as SARS [17] , while influenza pneumonia was more diffuse and involved both central and peripheral parts. Our results showed that the most common imaging signs of the COVID-19 group were pure GGO, GGO with consolidation, rounded opacities, bronchiolar wall thickening, and interlobular septal thickening, which were in line with previous studies [8, [18] [19] [20] . Only few patients with COVID-19 appeared as pure consolidation. According to a recent study, more consolidation would be found in patients with COVID-19 as the disease course increased, and more consolidation lesions were found in elder patients (> 50 years) than in the younger patients [14, 21] . Since a substantial amount of patients with COVID-19 in the present study were at early stage, and the median age of the patients was just 48 years, this might be a possible explanation why there were less complete consolidation lesions in the COVID-19 group. Follow-up CT scan should be done to validate this speculation. Interlobular septal thickening is a common sign on thin-slice chest CT; it may be seen in the presence of interstitial fluid, cellular infiltration, or fibrosis. This sign can be found in various viral pneumonias such as parainfluenza, Hantavirus, and SARS [9, 22] . Edema and smooth muscle hyperplasia could result in bronchiolar wall thickening, which has been reported in influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus [17, 22] . Nodule size is helpful in the differential diagnosis of infectious causes of nodules. It is reported that patients whose nodules were smaller than 10 mm in diameter were most likely to have a viral infection [23] . Nodules were present in 71% of the patients with influenza but in only 28% patients with COVID-19, which was consistent with a previous study [13] . Although each of the above sign is not specific, some combinations of the CT features may help better differentiate COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia: presence of pure GGO/rounded opacities/interlobular septal thickening and the absence of nodules; presence of pure GGO and interlobular septal thickening; presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening; and the absence of pleural effusion.",
