Despite international variations in ICU services (3), demand for ICU beds frequently exceeds their supply (1, 2) . Whereas resource-driven triage decisions are uncommon in North America, they are more frequent in Europe (2) . During a pandemic or mass disaster medical resources may become desperately inadequate with patients dying because of the lack ventilators or ICU beds as is currently occurring in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic (4) . The present recommendations are based on the joint collaboration of several worldwide clinicians who have been involved in ICU triage during epidemics and other surge conditions for several decades. circumstances are \"medical benefit\" or \"first come, first served\" (5, 6) . Patients who are \"too well\" or \"too sick\" to achieve a substantial benefit threshold would not be part of the potential pool. The now quite old Society of Critical Care Medicine triage consensus (5) stated that \"The foremost consideration in triage decisions is the expected outcome of the patient in terms of survival and function, which turns on the medical status of the patient. In general, patients with good prognoses for recovery have priority over patients with poor prognoses.\" In contrast, the American Thoracic Society recommended that \"when demand for ICU beds exceeds supply, medically appropriate patients should be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis\" (6) .",

Interestingly, in an attempt to develop a survival cutoff for triage decisions, only 77% of respondents agreed to a survival cutoff of 0.1% (7) . This may be related to intensivists attempting to rescue with an ICU trial even patients with little chance of surviving knowing that they can later discharge the patient or limit treatments (7) . Recent statements on ICU triage also recommended that patients be admitted based on their potential for benefit (8) (9) (10) . Most statements declared that triage criteria should be explicit, fair, disclosed in advance and not be based on race, ethnicity, sex, sexual preference, financial status, or social worth (5-10). Unfortunately, current triage tools using objective prioritization, diagnosis, or parameter models are unable to provide ICU admission and exclusion criteria with demonstrated improved outcomes (8) . Although attempts have been made to develop objective, triage scores (11) , none are currently being used.

As only a few patients are admitted to an ICU every day and beds are either available for incoming patients or can be made available by discharging patients, the \"first come, first served\" criteria can usually be used for one patient after another. Unfortunately, there are occasions where more than one patient is vying for the last ICU bed. How should the \"first patient\" be defined when determining \"first come, first served\" criteria? Is it the first patient admitted to the emergency department, the first patient that the triage officer heard about, the patient in the operating room for whom an ICU bed was reserved, or the first patient that the triage physician accepted? In addition, if there is more than one ICU admission candidate how should \"medical benefit\" be defined? Is it saving the most lives or saving the most life-years with ICU care for potential patients or the incremental medical benefit between ICU care versus ward care in these patients (10) ? If the latter, how much larger must the difference in benefit be? The South African consensus guideline recommended a benefit difference of 15-25% (10) . Although intensivists prognosticate more accurately than scoring systems (18) , uncertainty remains and physicians' accuracy lacks the consistency and precision patient desire.",

Triage data from some ICUs affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are shown in Table 1 . ICU beds and daily census increased approximately double from the previous year. It is too early to evaluate mortality which should be relevant at 28 days after admission. Recent reports of moderately high population mortality from COVID-19 in China (61.5%) (25) and high ICU mortality in the United States (67%) (26) are worrisome. It has been suggested that the high mortality maybe related to the large bed expansion without adequate healthcare resources (27) . This has implications for expansions that are currently occurring worldwide. Experience from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) showed that rapid and excessive expansion may overwhelm staff leading to excess infections in healthcare workers and compromising care (28) . Thus expansion should be matched by safe staffing to guarantee an appropriate quality of care and staff safety which necessarily limits expansion. A consensus group with first-hand experience of outbreak expansion during SARS concluded that safe expansion is realistically limited by availability of acceptably trained staff and limited to a maximum expansion of 50-100% of baseline capacity (29) . Hospitals must also balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity due to excess workload with other hospital needs (20) .",

It is strongly recommended that institutions develop prospective, objective protocols or algorithms to assist the implementation of their triage decisions to enhance consistency (31) and decrease moral distress among providers (24, 32) . First, when demand surges hospitals must increase ICU capacity by 100-200% (20, 33) before triage is instituted. Triage protocols should only be triggered when resources across a broad geographic area are or will be overwhelmed despite efforts to extend them and systems move from contingency to crisis mode (20) . As we can predict a wave of incoming patients from an impending peak in COVID-19, it might be prudent to start rationing prior to expending all resources on early cases with low probabilities for survival when it is clear that maximum surge capacity will certainly be exceeded in the near future. If hospitals cannot provide services, they should consider transferring patients to cities where ICU beds are still available (20) . Second, the potential ICU patients should be those that meet inclusion and no exclusion criteria. There is no perfect tool. In deciding which tool to use, we chose a tool that was simple, easy to understand and use and most important providing for quick assessments. As different countries and regions have different infrastructures and resources, laws, cultures, and religions, we attempted to offer flexibility in our recommendations along with explanations for the differing opinions so each region or country can choose what is most appropriate for them.",

Admission priority is given to patients from priority 1 to 4 based on their performance scores, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. If there are more priority 1 patients than beds, allocation will be based on incremental ICU benefit defined as saving the most life-years (evaluating mortality from both acute and chronic disorders) (24) . If there is a tie for ICU candidates, clinicians should use first come, first served (34) which they are accustomed to using and not a random allocation with a lottery (which they are not familiar using, losing valuable time). We recommend that the first-come patient should be defined as the first patient that the triage officer was informed of. The triage algorithm should apply equally to all ICU candidates with and without COVID-19 (35) . When the triage protocol commences, all ICU patients must be reevaluated for remaining in the ICU based on these same criteria.",

            "text": "1) Healthcare and other essential workers: There is controversy in the literature and there were differences of opinion among authors about prioritizing front-line Figure 1 . This tool provides an element of objectivity to help enhance consistency. It is not considered, however, a complete substitute for the carefully considered judgment of an experienced intensive care clinician. The presented algorithm is an example and each institution can decide on which performance score, comorbidities, and organ system failures to use based on their experience and what their staff ifs most comfortable using. A triage (prioritization) decision is a complex clinical decision made when ICU beds are limited. A structured decision-making process is important to maximize transparency and improve consistency in decision-making. A clinical estimation of likely benefit (outcomes from ICU admission compared with outcomes expected if the patient remained on the ward/other care area) is necessary so that patients who will benefit most from ICU are given priority. Examples of clinical conditions that the expert group believe would likely result in a failure of a patient to meet sufficient priority for admission is provided (priority 4). This conceptual algorithm outlines a recommended process for making an individual triage decision, based on a likelihood that survival without ICU care would be low (5-10% or less), and if admission criteria as laid out are met, survival would be estimated to be in excess of 50% short-to medium-term survival. The initial exclusion criteria are based on exclusion criteria used under \"normal\" conditions so that the same patients are eligible during pandemic conditions and given priority based on their likelihood to benefit. Then patients must meet one of the inclusion criteria. Priorities are then based on healthcare and other essential workers. A consensus stated that it is unlikely that workers becoming critically ill during a pandemic will recover sufficiently for them to return to work (31). In addition, conferring priority for healthcare workers could hinder societal trust in the triage mechanism at a time when public trust is essential. On the other hand, healthcare and other essential workers put themselves at high-risk supporting or saving others and are irreplaceable and essential for society and patient care (24, 35) . Some workers have been infected because they were not provided with adequate protection (37) . As COVID-19 may have a long duration and could recur, it is increasingly plausible that healthcare workers could return later to work. However, as healthcare workers have a clear conflict of interest as \"self advocates,\" we recommend this prioritization should be decided and implemented by societal and governmental agencies. Defining essential workers at the time of triage poses a practical problem, but consideration could be given to those workers excluded from lockdown as defined by official national, regional, and local orders. Because of the controversy, each country should decide what is most appropriate for their citizenry. 2) Younger patients: Age has also been suggested for ICU triage decisions. In Italy, patients are dying from COVID-19 because they have been triaged not to receive a ventilator because of their age (4). Advocates suggest that younger patients should be prioritized to have an equal opportunity to pass through the stages of life (24) . Despite the fact that elderly patients have a higher ICU mortality than younger patients, the incremental ICU benefit is greater for the elderly as patients more than 65 years had a greater difference in mortality between admitted and rejected patients compared with younger patients (2) . Although age should be taken into consideration along with other variables, age should not be the sole determining factor in triage decisions (7) . What is important is physiologic and not chronological age (7) . Younger patients have been taken into consideration by using incremental ICU benefit defined as saving the most life-years.",

We do, however, recommend that these protocols be guided by the principles discussed in this article and be flexible based on the severity of the pandemic demands and available resources. . those to be \"considered first\" (priority 1 and then priority 2) and \"considered last\" (priority 3 and then priority 4) with priority ranking from priority 1 to 4. These exclusions should help foster trust in a fairer triage system with less chance of discrimination. Each decision is assisted on the basis of an agreed criterion thresholds for the particular ICU at a specific time and will be dependent on available resources and the number of patients queuing for admission (e.g., stricter thresholds may be required during the peak of the pandemic, and less strict thresholds at the beginning and toward the end). The performance scores, comorbidities, and organ system failure variables chosen for this example are those that are the quickest to assess. Performance scores: The premorbid baseline condition can be assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score, the Clinical Frailty Score, the Karnofsky Performance Scale, or other functional impairment tool the user is accustomed. Comorbidities can be assessed using the ASA score, number, or severity of comorbidities. Organ system failures can be assessed using the number of organ system failures or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Reevaluations for admitted and refused patients should be performed ideally every 24 hr. At reassessment of patients at days 10-14 or if significant deterioration or lack of improvement in the patient's condition occurs decreasing the patient's predicted survival to below the current priority group receiving critical care, reallocation of ventilator/ICU bed (following review by triage committee) should be considered. Status/post (S/P) cardiac arrest refers to patients with a recent cardiac arrest or one leading to significant anoxic brain damage.",

Changes may be required in the triage tool and other recommendations as more knowledge about COVID-19 develops. Although intensivists make difficult decisions daily, they pale with the triage decisions currently being made with the COVID-19 pandemic. Courage lies not in making gut-wrenching, triage decisions but living with them. Failing to make and implement necessary triage is certainly worse than making a poor choice. During these difficult times, it is important to maintain our professionalism but also preserve our humanity and sensitivity to suffering patients and families, especially those with different cultures and religions.",
