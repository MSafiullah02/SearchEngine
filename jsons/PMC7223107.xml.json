The efficacy of positioning for maintaining oxygenation after preoxygenation has not been examined during hypovolemia or when using cerebral oxygenation. In fact, pulse oximetry oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) does not reflect changes in cerebral oxygenation and so could not be used to evaluate apnea tolerance in the cerebrum [11\u201313].",

After tracheostomy with regional anesthesia, anesthesia was maintained with 2.5% inhaled isoflurane and a 1:1 L/min oxygen\u2013air mixture [fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.6] via mechanical ventilation. We did not use positive end-expiratory pressure in this study. End-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide was set at 40\u201345 mmHg during animal preparation, and this ventilator setting was maintained throughout the study. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored with three cutaneous electrodes, and pulse oximetry was monitored with a sensor (LNCS sensor; Masimo, Tokyo, Japan) positioned on the shaved left ear. The right jugular vein was cannulated with a 14-gauge double-lumen catheter and a 5-F pulmonary arterial catheter (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), and the right femoral artery was cannulated with a 16-gauge catheter. All catheters were placed under local anesthesia after inducing general anesthesia. We infused saline 100 mL/h for maintenance intravenous fluids during the study.

The probe, which consists of the emitter and receiver, is fixed in a rubber holder to ensure an emitter\u2013receiver distance of 30 mm.

Four minutes after changing the fraction of inspired oxygen, 20 mg of rocuronium bromide was administered to prevent spontaneous breathing.

Lee et al. reported that the 25\u00b0 back-up position provided a better laryngeal view than the supine position [22]. Although these findings suggested that the head-up position is more suitable for tracheal intubation than the supine position, anesthesiologists are accustomed to the supine position and may change patients to that position after head-up preoxygenation [6].",

Therefore, the pulmonary reserve in the FRC, which varies with body position, affected the time to SpO2 < 70%.

The head-up position worsened hemodynamics during hypovolemia and decreased DO2, although VO2 did not change. We speculate that the head-up position during hypovolemia increased the ventilation/perfusion ratio secondary to low perfusion (dead space-like effect) and, compared with normovolemia, decreased the alveolar fraction of oxygen, resulting in decreased oxygen storage after preoxygenation despite seeing no change in the increased FRC [3].",

The present study has uniquely evaluated the benefits of head-up preoxygenation during normal and hypovolemic conditions using both pulse oximetry and NIRS. Furthermore, in our study, the parietal scalp was removed to exclude contamination of scalp blood flow [14\u201317], which is a limitation of NIRS. This maneuver allowed us to provide accurate cerebral oxygenation values using NIRS.

During hypovolemia, however, each TOI significantly decreased and, especially in the head-up and head-up to supine positions, shifted the relation to the left at similar SaO2 levels (Fig. 4b). Specifically, TOI values in the head-up and head-up to supine positions during hypovolemia were approximately 50% at 100% of SaO2, which were similar to the TOI values in the supine and head-down positions at < 70% of SaO2. This deterioration in cerebral oxygenation could not be identified by SaO2 (Fig. 2b) and/or SpO2 values. TOI did not recover even when the head-up position was changed to supine just before apnea. Caregivers should consider that the head-up position during hypovolemia can reduce cerebral oxygenation. We previously showed that acute anemia (hemorrhage and subsequent fluid resuscitation) and/or \u03b21-blocker administration also shifted the relation between TOI and SaO2 to the left, and reduced cerebral tolerance for hypoxia [12]. The effect is substantially enhanced by \u03b21-blocker administration during acute anemia, and this phenomenon is thought to partly explain why \u03b2-blockers can increase the incidence of stroke under acute hemodilution during the perioperative period. In contrast, dobutamine, a \u03b21-stimulant, increased cerebral tolerance for hypoxia and/or anemia [13]. These alterations of cerebral tolerance could not be identified with arterial blood oxygenation. On the basis of these findings, we recommend NIRS monitoring at 1-s intervals along with pulse oximetry for emergent tracheal intubation in critical care patients. Cerebral NIRS, which estimates the oxygen supply/demand balance, might predict individual apneic tolerance better than the desaturation time.",

First, we used the apneic desaturation time in the first supine position as a reference for comparisons with results in the other positions, whereas interpreting the data may have been more reliable if we had included a time control group with no changes in the pigs\u2019 position. Furthermore, we induced apnea by disconnecting them from the ventilator after 5 min of 100% oxygen ventilation. This state, however, might not represent clinical preoxygenation, which typically includes the non-ventilated, but oxygen-diffusion, duration via face mask. In addition, the time to SpO2 < 70% after 100% oxygen preoxygenation for 5 min was only 100\u2013140 s in our animals, which is shorter than the expected time in adult humans [24]. The VO2 of the pigs in our study, which were approximately 2 months old, was approximately 170 mL/min/m2 at baseline before apnea occurred (the pigs\u2019 mean body surface area was 0.77 m2, calculated by body weight [25]), which is equivalent to the VO2 of a human infant. Although the size of the oxygen reservoir in the lungs and/or FRC might be small in pigs, high VO2 is likely to be the main reason for the early decrease in SpO2. Therefore, our findings should not be directly extrapolated to adult human patients. Finally, although changes in time to SpO2 < 70% and/or TOI secondary to the position changes were evident, and the order of the pigs\u2019 positions was randomized, the number of study animals was small. Larger, human studies are needed to clarify our findings.",

The head-up position should be retained during tracheal intubation. Although the effects of postural changes on cerebral oxygenation are minimal under normal circulatory volume, under evident hypovolemia the head-up position can decrease cerebral oxygenation, which is not detected by conventional pulse oximetry. Thus, head-up preoxygenation might be harmful in these patients.\n",
