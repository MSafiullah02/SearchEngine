Therefore, an N-terminal acetyl octapeptide, Ac-RKILFLDG, containing an HIV-PR cleavage site was employed as the substrate. It was not necessary to remove excess substrate and acetyl product (Ac-RKIL) from the reaction mixture after the enzymatic hydrolysis because no FL signals from these peptides were produced by this reaction, whereas another product FLDG was selectively reacted. Therefore, the enzyme activity of HIV-PR could be readily assayed by measuring the FL intensity of the FLDG derivative.",

The fluorogenic reaction was carried out for different reaction times (5\u201315 min) at 100 \u00b0C and pH 7.0 (Fig. 1\nA). The maximum yield of the fluorescent product was observed at 10 min. When the fluorogenic reaction was carried out for 10 min at pH 7.0 under the different temperatures of 80 to 120 \u00b0C (Fig. 1B), the fluorescent derivative was produced by the high temperatures of the reaction. However, the FL intensity was gradually decreased at a higher temperature than 100 \u00b0C, probably due to instability of the fluorescent product at the higher temperatures. The FL production was also greatly affected by pH of sodium borate solution. For the pH examination, the fluorogenic reaction was carried out at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min (Fig. 1C). The signal could not be detected at a lower pH than pH 6.0; however, the maximum signal was obtained at approximately pH 7.0. The concentrations of catechol, NaIO4, and sodium borate at pH 7.0 were individually optimized, and then the maximum signal was obtained by the use of 0.83 mM catechol, 0.17 mM NaIO4, and 50 mM borate (pH 7.0) at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min in the aqueous reaction mixture.",

When this fluorogenic reaction with the peptide (FLDG) was carried out at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min, however, the production yield of the fluorescent derivative of the peptide was approximately 65% of that at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. The different conditions between the peptide and the amino acid amide might be caused by the stability of the fluorescent products given that the product of the amino acid amide was more stable than that of the peptide. The stability of the product of the peptide was investigated by measuring the FL intensity after the fluorogenic reaction. The product was stable at 0 to 4 \u00b0C for at least 48 h, although the product was unstable at 100 \u00b0C and slightly unstable at room temperature.

A number of commercially available inhibitors have been investigated for their characterization of HIV-PR activity. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, the residual activity of HIV-PR was 70% to 80% of its initial activity at a high concentration of 1.0 mM inhibitors such as AEBSF, E-64, bestatin, and aprotinin. However, the residual activity of HIV-PR was less than 5% at 1.0 mM pepstatin A, which was one of the specific inhibitors for aspartic proteases such as HIV-PR [15], [16], [17]. The activity of HIV-PR in the cell lysate was strongly decreased with increasing concentrations of pepstatin A and was completely inhibited with 100 \u03bcM pepstatin A. The data indicated that the IC50 of pepstatin A is 10 \u00d7 10\u22126\n M. Therefore, the proposed method is specific for the assay of HIV-PR activity.",

In this case, the activity values that were obtained by individually repeated assays (n\n = 10) using all of the same reagents within a day indicated a larger error with a 7.35% relative standard deviation (RSD), as shown in Fig. 5\nA. However, the pH adjustment using the same NaOH solution in the presence of PBS (pH 7.0) gave satisfactory precision with a 1.82% RSD for the assays (Fig. 5B). Because mixing the strong alkaline solution and the acetate buffer (pH 5.5) resulted in varying pHs, it is better to use PBS (pH 7.0) for the pH adjustment. Therefore, PBS that has a buffering strength at pH 7.0 should be used for such pH adjustment.",

This assay method is based on the selective fluorogenic reaction of a peptide fragment cleaved from the substrate with the reagents of catechol, borate, and sodium periodate. The conditions for the enzymatic and fluorogenic reactions were optimized, and thus HIV-PR activity in cell lysate could be readily assayed. This assay was applicable to the evaluation of several protease inhibitors for their effect on the activity of HIV-PR. This proposed spectrofluorometric method is reliable and inexpensive, and it does not require any special modified substrates. It is important to measure HIV-PR activity in the blood of AIDS patients. Unfortunately, no specimens of AIDS patients could be prepared in our laboratory due to the biohazard restriction. Therefore, the application of this method is considered as being able to discriminate HIV activity in the presence of other proteases.",
