The majority of patients presents with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 . However, about 5% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment. Acute hypoxemic failure with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (>30/min) usually leads to ICU admission. At that point, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen. Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date there is no specific treatment available-the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Early intubation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be avoided where possible and carried out with utmost precaution.",

            "text": "Zusammenfassung Seit Dezember 2019 verbreitet sich das neuartige Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -Corona Virus-2) rasch im Sinne einer weltweiten Pandemie. Dies stellt Kliniker und Krankenh\u00e4user vor gro\u00dfe Herausforderungen und belastet die Gesundheitssysteme vieler L\u00e4nder in einem nie dagewesenen Ma\u00df. Die Mehrheit der Patienten zeigt lediglich milde Symptome der sogenannten Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Dennoch ben\u00f6tigen etwa 5 % eine intensivmedizinische Behandlung. Die akute hypox\u00e4mische respiratorische Insuffizienz mit Dyspnoe und hoher Atemfrequenz (>30/min) f\u00fchrt in der Regel zur Aufnahme auf die Intensivstation. Oft finden sich dann bereits bilaterale pulmonale Infiltrate in der Bildgebung und im Verlauf entwickeln viele Patienten ein Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Bisher gibt es noch keine zugelassene spezifische Therapieoption. Das Hauptziel der supportiven Therapie ist, eine ausreichende Oxygenierung sicherzustellen. Die fr\u00fche Intubation und wiederholte Bauchlagerung sind dabei wichtige Elemente in der Behandlung von hypox\u00e4mischen COVID-19 Patienten. Die strikte Einhaltung der Basishygiene, einschlie\u00dflich der H\u00e4ndehygiene, sowie das korrekte Tragen von ad\u00e4quater pers\u00f6nlicher Schutzausr\u00fcstung ist im Umgang mit den Patienten unabdingbar. Prozeduren, die zur Aerosolbildung f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnten, sollten, soweit m\u00f6glich, vermieden, und, falls n\u00f6tig, mit \u00e4u\u00dferster Sorgfalt und Vorbereitung durchgef\u00fchrt werden.",
