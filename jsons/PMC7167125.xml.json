            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem throughout the world, especially in East Asia and Africa. An estimated two billion people, roughly 30% of the world's population, have been infected with HBV, and over 350 million patients have chronic hepatitis B (CHB) [Liaw and Chu, 2009]. Each year, about 786,000 deaths are caused by HBV infection or its associated liver diseases [Lozano et al., 2012], including hepatic decompensation, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma; HBV\u2010infected individuals are at higher risk of all these HBV related diseases [Lee et al., 2013]. Although efficient prophylactic vaccines have been developed for prevention of HBV infection, there is still no cure for existing infection. The current clinical applied therapeutic agents for CHB are mainly immunomodulators and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, which can be used either separately or in combination [Yuen and Lai, 2001; Papatheodoridis et al., 2008; Scaglione and Lok, 2012; Trepo et al., 2014]. Interferon alpha (IFN\u2010\u03b1) is the best\u2010known immunodulator, and controls HBV infection by stimulating the cellular antiviral cytokine expression to inhibit viral replication and by enhancing the host immune responses to eliminate the HBV\u2010infected hepatocytes [Yuen and Lai, 2001]. However, its poor response against CHB, high commercial cost, and various adverse effects (AEs) limit the wide clinical application of this drug.",

These oral antiviral agents mainly target HBV polymerase and reverse transcriptase by rapidly and potently inhibiting their activities. Although nucleoside/nucleotide analogues have fewer AEs, they fail to eradicate HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, which results in viral relapse after stopping the medication [Yuen and Lai, 2001; Trepo et al., 2014]. In addition, the development of drug resistance during therapy also limits the effective application of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Some of the most recent drugs, such as entecavir and tenofovir, have been observed to induce only a very low level of drug resistance, but long\u2010term application may still induce expansion of HBV strains with mutations resisting these drugs [Trepo et al., 2014]. Thus, developing novel effective therapeutic approaches and agents is a necessary step against HBV infection.",

            "text": "Selenium (Se) is an essential trace mineral for animals and humans. In addition to antioxidant activity, Se has also shown anti\u2010inflammatory and anticancer properties [Rayman, 2000]. Se functions in either its inorganic forms, such as sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) and sodium selenate, or its organic forms, such as the amino acids selenocysteine (Sec) and selenomethionine (SeMet), and multiple selenomolecles as intermediary metabolites [Papp et al., 2007]. Upon absorption, the inorganic salts in their oxidized forms [selenite (Se4+) or selenate (Se6+)] can be reduced to selenide (Se2\u2212) by using reducing equivalents from reduced glutathione and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) [Zeng and Combs, 2008]. As a storage mechanism, SeMet can replace normal methionine in protein synthesis, and then be released reversibly by the normal metabolic process as necessary [Schrauzer, 2000]. Sec is probably the most abundant biologically active form of selenium in vivo, and can be specially incorporated into selenoproteins as the 21st amino acid encoded by the UGA codon [Metanis and Hilvert, 2014]. Importantly, Sec might play some important biological roles in vivo, as most of the 25 identified human selenoproteins have shown enzymatic redox function with catalytic or antioxidant activities conferred by Sec [Kryukov et al., 2003; Papp et al., 2007].",

For some RNA viruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3/0) (cause of Keshan disease), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola virus, the absence of Se causes accumulation of mutations in their genome, leads to changes in the virulence\u2010associated genetic structures [Beck et al., 2003; Harthill, 2011]. Viral glutathione peroxidase (vGPx), a selenoprotein with antioxidant activity, has been found to be encoded by some RNA virus such as HIV and hepatitis C virus [Zhang et al., 1999]. In virus\u2010infected cells, vGPx inhibits ROS\u2010induced apoptosis, a host response against infection, and further promotes viral replication [Papp et al., 2007].",

When the concentration was fixed at 2.5 \u00b5M, progressive repression by Na2SeO3 of HBV RNA level in HepG2.2.15 cells occurred in line with the length of treatment, starting from Day 1 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the viral transcription level in HepG2.2.15 was quantified using qPCR, and the host gene \u03b2\u2010actin was chosen as the internal reference. The result of qPCR (Fig. S1) was consistent with northern blot assay (Fig. 4A). Viral mRNA was inhibited by Na2SeO3 treatment in dose\u2010dependent and time\u2010dependent manners, which was reduced to 49.28 \u00b1 3.82% in the presence of 2.5 \u00b5M Na2SeO3 for four days.

Na2SeO3 treatment at 2.5 \u00b5M caused a dramatic suppression of HBV RNAs from Day 1; however, the time\u2010dependent suppression effect was not as clear as in the other two models. This was probably because the RNA amount had already dropped to a very low level, and therefore the effects at the subsequent examined time points were less obvious (Fig. 4C). In all models, 30 nM ETV treatment produced no effect on HBV transcription levels, because it specifically inhibits protein\u2010priming activity [Jones et al., 2013].",

Although Se has been reported to influence multiple virus infections [Rayman, 2000; Beck et al., 2003; Beck, 2007; Harthill, 2011], only limited information is available about whether it has any effect on HBV infection. One study has shown significantly lower concentrations of Se in serum from patients with HBV infection compared with healthy individuals [Khan et al., 2012]. Moreover, according to an eight\u2010year follow\u2010up investigation of 130,471 individuals in Qidong, China, Se supplementation via table salt significantly reduced the incidence of primary liver cancer [Yu et al., 1997]. However, none of the available studies showed solid evidence of the relationship between Se and HBV replication. The present study is the first to demonstrate direct inhibitory effects of Na2SeO3 on HBV at the cellular level, using different HBV cell models.",

HBsAg is a hallmark of infection, although HBeAg is usually associated with high levels of viral replication. Although nucleoside/nucleotide analogues can inhibit HBV replication and result in obvious reductions in HBV DNA and HBeAg levels in serum, they have little impact on HBsAg secretion [Scaglione and Lok, 2012]. The present study revealed evident declines in HBsAg/HBeAg levels with Na2SeO3 treatment in all three tested models (Figs. 2 and 3). However, it must be noted that the HCMV\u2010promoter driven 1.1\u00d7HBV construct should not allow for the synthesis of HBeAg because of the lack of intact precore region at the 5' end [Nassal, 1992]. And HBeAg detected in HuH\u20107 transfected with 1.1\u00d7HBV plasmid might be core proteins due to antibody cross reactivity. So, intracellular core protein level was also determined in these models, and the result showed Na2SeO3 treatment obviously reduced core expression in host cell, but not the internal reference protein (Fig. S2). These results prompted us to further investigate the reason of the viral antigen decreases at the HBV transcription level.",

As HBV mRNAs synthesis is primarily dependent on RNA polymerase II and the transcriptional regulation system of the host cells [Levrero et al., 2009; Quasdorff and Protzer, 2010], it is likely that the following cellular factors were possibly involved in the observed suppression.",

            "text": "Finally, a trans\u2010acting factor, HBx, encoded by the HBV genome, is a multifunctional viral protein and is broadly involved in transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle progress, apoptosis, genetic stability, and oncogenesis through protein\u2013protein interaction [Bouchard and Schneider, 2004; Tang et al., 2006; Ng and Lee, 2011; Motavaf et al., 2013]. Tang et al. reported that both HBV transcription and replication can be affected simultaneously by HBx, but the transcriptional activation of HBx may be critical for its augmenting effect on HBV replication [Tang et al., 2006]. HBx also induces cytosolic calcium elevation and viral DNA replication, but not viral transcription, by interacting with Bcl\u20102 family members [Geng et al., 2012] or by activating cytosolic calcium\u2010dependent proline\u2010rich tyrosine kinase\u20102 (Pyk2) [Bouchard et al., 2001]. Although Se has not been proved to have direct effects on HBx, it has been demonstrated to affect HBx\u2010related host factors, including p53 and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB, and to result in a significant decrease in cellular calcium release [Uguz and Naziroglu, 2012]. Thus, HBx is another suspected viral factor that possibly mediates selenite\u2010induced inhibition of HBV transcription and replication.",

The progressive reduction in HBV DNA displayed a similar trend to the decrease in HBV mRNAs, which indicated that one potential mechanism of Na2SeO3 in suppressing HBV replication is by inhibition of viral transcription. In addition to suppressing viral transcription, Se may also inhibit HBV replication by cytosolic calcium release, which is related to HBx in host cells [Bouchard et al., 2001; Geng et al., 2012]. The hypothesis that selenite inhibits HBV transcription and replication via host and viral factors still needs to be verified, and the potential involved factor(s) need to be identified by further experiments.",

The less potent of Na2SeO3 on inhibiting HBV replication compared to the other tested drugs is probably due to its indirect effect on viral polymerase.
