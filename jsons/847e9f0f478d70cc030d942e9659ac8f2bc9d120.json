Multiplex PCR was more sensitive than the multiplex immunofluoresence culture assay (R-mix) and also detected additional respiratory viruses that were not covered by the R-mix panel. The number of respiratory viruses detected in symptomatic patients was significantly higher than asymptomatic patients in both adult and pediatric patients. Herpesviral infections were the predominant cause of lower respiratory tract infection in the organ transplant recipients, whereas respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen in non-transplant patients particularly children.

Disease severity can be affected by various host and viral predisposing factors such as age, immune-status of the host, single or mixed infections and virulence mechanisms of the viral pathogen. The common respiratory viruses causing infections are influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), coronaviruses (CoV), and adenovirus (AdV). Newly emerging respiratory viral pathogens include swine origin influenza A H1N1, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human bocavirus (hBoV) particularly in pediatric patients [Lu et al., 2006; Dare et al., 2007; Gordon, 2009; Scalera and Mossad, 2009 ]. Immunocompromised hosts such as organ transplant recipients are often infected with opportunistic herpesviruses. Therefore, rapid screening for respiratory viral pathogens is critical to allow timely therapeutic decisions and limit pathogenesis.",

However, though relatively rapid, this technique is limited to detection of only a few of the common respiratory viruses. One of the advancements of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is multiplex real-time PCR which allows detection of multiple RNA and DNA targets in a single tube [van Elden et al., 2004] . In this study, a multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed targeting respiratory RNA and DNA viruses to assess its utility as a rapid molecular screening tool for clinical diagnosis.

A total of 728 specimens were collected from 585 adult and pediatric patients, of whom 258 were organ transplant recipients. Clinical information on all patients was collected for correlation with laboratory data. Upper respiratory tract infection was defined as clinical symptoms of rhinorrhea, sore throat or cough with or without fever, without evidence of dyspnea and abnormalities in chest X-ray. Lower respiratory tract infection was defined as presence of dyspnea and or clinical evidence of pulmonary pathology on chest X-ray along with fever or cough [Machado et al., 2003] . Patients presenting without apparent respiratory symptoms were defined as asymptomatic. Most of these latter specimens were obtained from organ transplant recipients as routine surveillance cultures.

First, similar to other studies [Kim et al., 2009; Murali et al., 2009] , the multiplex PCR detected more viruses than viral culture/DFA. The sensitivity of this multiplex PCR was found to be comparable to singleplex PCR for individual viruses and higher than viral culture/DFA detection. The reason for this higher sensitivity is that PCR detects lower titers of viral genomes as well as viruses that are not replication competent [Liolios et al., 2001] . Second, viruses that were not included in the R-mix culture panel such as hMPV, hBoV, HHV-6, and hCoV could also be detected by the multiplex PCR assay. Since this study was carried out before the emergence of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus pandemic, our multiplex PCR did not include primers for this target. However in 2009, the multiplex PCR assay was modified for detection of swineorigin influenza A H1N1. We found it to be highly sensitive and specific for detection of the three predominant influenza viruses, that is, using the A lower number of respiratory viral infections were noted in immunocompetent compared to immunocompromised adults. It has been suggested that respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients differ from immunocompetent patients by higher viral replication leading to increased viral shedding [Leung et al., 2005; Camps Serra et al., 2008] . Compared to some other studies [Templeton et al., 2004; Hindiyeh et al., 2005] , our multiplex PCR had relatively lower sensitivity. However, more respiratory viral infections were detected in the symptomatic group than in asymptomatic immunocompetent adults, indicating true active infections. The overall positivity rate of multiplex PCR was 46.5%, which is comparable to that reported by others (Gadsby et al., 2010) . Among the positives, 78.4% were from symptomatic patients and 25% from asymptomatic patients. A significant association was also observed between symptomatic respiratory illness and positive viral detection.",

The spectrum of viral isolates differed between adult and pediatric patients as well as between organ transplant and non-transplant recipients. Herpesviral infections CMV, HHV-6, and HSV-1 were more predominant in adult organ transplant recipients, whereas RSV was present predominantly in pediatric non-transplant patients. These opportunistic herpesviruses were also associated significantly with lower respiratory tract infection in non-organ transplant recipients and apparently immunocompetent hosts. The significance of these herpesviral infections, which are known to cause life-long, latent/reactivated infections, needs to be evaluated further. Detection of RNA transcripts and/or antigens or determining viral load using quantitative PCR for these viruses will help in detecting replicating viruses. These herpesviruses have been reported previously to cause pneumonitis in immunocompetent adults, underlying their role in community-acquired pneumonias [Karakelides et al., 2003; Merk et al., 2005; Rafailidis et al., 2008] . In the present study, RSV was also significantly associated with symptomatic respiratory infections in organ transplant recipients. RSV and other community viral infections have been reported to be important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised transplant recipients [Muir and Pillay, 1998; Nichols et al., 2001] .
