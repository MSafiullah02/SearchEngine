            "text": "Rabies is a dreadful disease caused by a virus belonging to genus Lyssavirus of family Rhabdoviridae. Rabies virus (RABV) infection is considered to be one of the oldest and most fatal neurological diseases known to mankind. Present practice of rabies control in animals and humans is to take prophylactic pre-exposure vaccination. Post-exposure vaccination is obligatory in all cases as treatment after human exposure to infected animal bites (Wiktor et al., 1984). Sometimes, due to unnoticed exposure or vaccination failure, the disease is diagnosed after the onset of clinical symptoms and death becomes unavoidable due to unavailability of any effective line of treatment for clinical cases of rabies. Therefore, efforts are being made to develop an effective antiviral strategy against rabies with the potential to suppress virus infection in cells and clear the infection without damaging the cell. The various approaches include strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi). Considering the potential of RNAi as antiviral agent, few groups have evaluated RNAi based antiviral agents against rabies (Brandao et al., 2007, Israsena et al., 2009).",

It is a highly conserved natural mechanism described for plants, fungi, worms, insects, and mammals (Ma et al., 2007, for review). The gene silencing mechanism is mediated by short RNA, named siRNAs, whereby an RNA-induced silencing complex forms an activated complex that target mRNA with sequence complementary to the siRNAs. This renders the mRNA transcripts inert and degradable resulting in a specific knockdown of the targeted gene expression. The sequence-specific knockdown of viral genes in infected cells generated great interest in development of siRNAs-based antiviral agents. siRNA-based antiviral activity has been reported for many RNA and DNA viruses in vitro and in vivo, including, human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human papilloma virus, dengue virus, hepatitis delta virus, murine gamma herpesviruses, severe acute coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections (Sliva and Schnierle, 2010, for review).",

Consequently, we selected RABV-N and L as our target genes for designing siRNAs as these are conserved and essential for virus multiplication. Moreover, while selecting siRNAs, the conserved region on RABV genome with no potential region for secondary structure formation was considered using siRNA designing algorithm. Since screening of effective siRNAs with infectious viruses is tedious, time-consuming and requires intense safety conditions, a simple method for the screening of potent siRNAs was used in the present study. We demonstrated that transient co-transfection of a reporter gene construct and a silencing construct was an appropriate method to screen potent siRNAs by inducing cleavage of the mRNA fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter by gene-specific siRNA. This provided a simple model for assessing the siRNA efficiency for gene silencing by analysis (reduced expression) of the fusion protein expression with fluorescent microscope. The si-N and si-L consistently inhibited the expression of RFP fusion version of RABV-N or L proteins in three independent experiments and indicated potent siRNAs for further studies. Screening of effective siRNAs using transient co-transfection of plasmids has been reported previously for targets other than RABV genes (Sanchez et al., 2005, Meng et al., 2007, Ong et al., 2008).",

Since RABV-PV-11 strain is adapted to BHK-21 cells, it served as a model to analyze the efficiency of siRNAs in vitro. RNAi functions by identifying and degrading mRNA that shares sequence complementarity with the siRNA. Therefore, real-time PCR analysis was used to analyze the effect of si-N or si-L on RABV-N or L mRNA expression, respectively. The level of RABV-N mRNA in the Ad-N-treated, RABV-infected cells was significantly reduced (1442-fold) compared to the Ad-L-treated cells (1.43-fold). GAPDH was used as a cellular mRNA control and showed no effect of the siRNA treatment. Further, the level of RABV-L mRNA in Ad-N-treated cells was also reduced (380-fold), indicating an interrelated effect. This may be due to the fact that RABV-N performs its effect on RABV multiplication in two ways; RABV-N is a major structural protein and also plays a regulatory role in the switch from gene expression (mRNA production) to genome replication. The intracellular ratio of leader RNA to N protein has been reported to regulate the switch from viral gene transcription to genome replication (Wunner, 1991). To confirm the antiviral potential of RABV-N-specific siRNAs, we monitored the presence of viral progeny in the supernatants of siRNA-treated-RABV infected cells. The level of fold-decrease in RABV-N expression was correlated with decrease in infective virus titer in Ad-N treated cells. The decrease in infective RABV titer in Ad-N-treated cells was 88.4% compared to 41.5% in Ad-L-treated cells.",

These findings have significant implications for the use of siRNA as therapeutic agent against RABV infection. However, to attain absolute protection other siRNA delivery methods (e.g., lentiviral), route (intravenous crossing blood\u2013brain barrier), dose (single or multiple siRNAs) and time of therapeutic administration of siRNAs have to be carefully optimized in mice and in non-human primates before recommending for therapeutic use.",
