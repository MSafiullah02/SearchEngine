Each with a unique profile of genetic content, GC-richness, high-copy repeats and low-copy repeats (Bacolla et al. 2006) . Particularly near regions of structurally important sequences, such as the centromere, the genomic landscape can become quite problematic for analysis. The primary factor contributing to the difficulty in studying these areas within the genome is that clusters of genomic duplications and unusual repeat structures often lie in close proximity. Consequently, sequence similarity-based methods of global genome assembly fail to properly assign the correct positions of duplicated sequences. Annotation and interpretation of data from current DNA sequencing technologies can be difficult, because artificial overlaps form, significant warping of working draft sequences occurs, and numerous gaps appear in the assembly, all which, reduce overall quality and relevance of the assembly. These effects are further compounded by the absence of unique sequence-tagged sites (STS) or DNA landmarks within such regions and a general under-representation of such areas in clone-by-clone sequencing. Thus, current DNA sequencing instruments are challenged by the presence of large spans of duplicated sequence, which interfere with genome analysis.",

Furthermore, recent genome sequence data show that strains passaged several times in media will display single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and multiple isolates of a single species will not be identical base pair by base pair.
