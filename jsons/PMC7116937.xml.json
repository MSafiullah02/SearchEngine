            "text": "At a time when global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 pandemic influenza have coincided with regulatory and structural changes within the United Kingdom (UK) aviation industry, the challenges of safeguarding public health have been exacerbated. Scholars have long considered international air, rail and sea ports as potential sites of entry for threats to human health (Gushulak and MacPherson, 2000, Katz et al., 2006, Meyers, 1981). However, recent transformations of individual mobility brought about by more diffuse air travel have highlighted the existence of multiple \u2018borders within\u2019 states through which an infectious disease may enter or leave a country (Budd, Bell, & Warren, 2011). An emerging literature considers the concept of \u2018preparedness\u2019 (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, Ingram, 2009), which \u2013 unlike other anticipatory actions such as pre-emption and precaution \u2013 aims to stop the effects of an event from \u2018disrupting the circulations and interdependencies that make up a valued life\u2019 (Anderson, 2010: 15). In the United States (US), Collier and Lakoff have drawn attention to the development of \u2018distributed preparedness\u2019, an \u2018organizational framework and set of techniques for approaching security threats\u2019 across a number of geographical scales (2008: 7). The practices associated with it include: the coordination of planning and response interventions across a number of public and private actors; mapping the vulnerability of vital systems to a potentially catastrophic event; and the use of scenarios to test joint working amongst local, regional and national agencies.",

We focus on the airport as a key node for entry and exit, and examine the concept of distributed preparedness as a series of measures put in place to enable the management of changing patterns of infectious disease spread. The paper builds on international research from the social sciences and epidemiology, and makes reference to official, \u2018grey\u2019, literature, to conduct an empirical examination of distributed preparedness interventions in geographical locations surrounding selected international airports in the UK. We draw on in-depth interviews conducted with emergency planners, environmental health officers and healthcare practitioners employed by airports, local authorities, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and Health Protection Units (HPUs) in order to analyse the multi-agency interactions that were in play during the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic influenza outbreak. In conclusion, we highlight three ways in which our empirical research develops conceptions of distributed preparedness to inform the management of an emerging infectious disease outbreak at the \u2018borders within\u2019 the UK.",

            "text": "Progressive liberalisation of the European air transport sector during the last two decades has resulted in a dramatic increase in international air traffic in the UK, particularly at smaller regional airports that historically handled few (if any) international flights (Budd et al., 2011). In Europe, a series of measures, beginning in the early 1990s, allowed new airlines to enter the marketplace and airport operators to engage in more effective competition. The reforms dissolved traditional bilateral and multilateral air service agreements that specified which airlines could fly individual routes, the frequency with which the services could operate, the airports that could be served, and the airfares that could be charged (Goetz & Graham, 2004). One, arguably unintended, consequence of the sudden \u2018opening up\u2019 of regional airports in Europe (Maertens, 2010) to regular long-haul services has been the dramatic increase in the number of sites through which potentially infected travellers and unwanted pathogens can enter or leave a country. In 1990, fewer than 100 scheduled international destinations were served from UK regional airports, but by 2010 the figure had increased to over 450, with particularly significant growth occurring at Liverpool, Bristol and East Midlands (CAA, 2011). While the majority of international flights at UK regional airports are short-haul European services, many of these airports \u2013 crucially, from a public health perspective - also now support a significant number of long-haul \u2018spoke\u2019, or feeder, services to airports in the eastern United States, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent (Budd et al., 2011). These services, combined with the growing number of transfer passengers they carry, have significant implications for public health provision and border control in the UK by both compounding and also obfuscating the geographical complexities of individual journeys. We argue that this has fundamentally altered the spatiality of Port Health provision in the UK and exacerbated the challenges of discharging effective health security safeguards at every new point of entry in the UK.",

Indeed, there has been a dedicated Health Control Unit at London Heathrow since 1947 to handle the health risks posed by international aeromobility. Moreover, considerable scholarly work evaluates the role of air travel in the spread of infectious disease (Ali and Keil, 2006, Gerard, 2002, Warren et al., 2010). The threat posed to a nation\u2019s health by global infectious disease has been widely theorised as \u2018biosecurity\u2019, a concept given to various technical and political efforts that aim to safeguard human, animal and plant health (for example, Hinchcliffe & Bingham, 2008). Yet, although such academic work has sought to understand the various forms of expertise and practices through which particular disease threats are identified, articulated, and managed, there has arguably been less focus on the preparations undertaken to manage the spread of human pathogens in the localities surrounding airports and the social relationships that result from this process. We contend that contemporary disease preparedness, which increasingly involves the study of individual airline passengers\u2019 mobility, is creating new geographies of containment and control which often begin before a passenger enters an airport and continue long after their arrival at their final destination (Warren et al., 2010).",

Whilst the study of sanitary control at geopolitical borders is important, we wish to consider preparedness practices resulting from significant spatial realignments within the UK following the liberalisation of the European aviation industry, and the implications for the social and professional relationships within and between the affected organisations. Borders are increasingly being extended to nodes within national territories beyond the major international airports and, of particular significance to this paper, they are entering the localities within which these airports are situated.",

Building on this statement, we focus on \u2018new\u2019 international airports \u2018within\u2019, as sites exposed to infectious disease threats. Increasingly, theoretical and empirical literature has identified the airport as a site in which mobile bodies can be mapped and through which infectious diseases may enter a country (Adey, 2009, Saint Michaels Hospital, 2009, Warren et al., 2010). For example, the BIO.DIASPORA project, undertaken by a team of Canadian researchers and medical practitioners, examined the airport as a point of vulnerability and as one which exposed the nation to infectious disease threats (St Michael\u2019s Hospital, 2009). Yet, although that study considered the extent to which public health preparedness may be strengthened to manage these threats, it gave little detail on the types of intervention to be enacted at these sites. Gaber, Goetsch, Diel, Doerr, and Gottschalk (2009) have developed detailed guidelines for entry and exit screening at international airports, arguing that infectious disease transmission is more likely to occur at the airport before or after, rather than during, the flight. Therefore, a flexible approach is required in relation to community mitigation measures, corresponding to \u2018specific characteristics of individual biological agents\u2019 (Gaber et al., 2009: 595). According to Dickmann et al. (2011), risk communication forms an integral part of these interventions. In particular, attention should be paid to the provision of information to inbound and outbound passengers and to airport staff, taking account of their different needs (Dickmann et al., 2011).",

The growth of international services at UK regional airports - and the resultant re-siting (or localisation) of the national border within UK territory - has resulted in a dispersal of public health protection interventions. Regional airports are particularly vulnerable as, following liberalisation of the UK aviation industry during the 1990s, they handle increasing volumes of international air travel, and hence become part of the re-situated border.",

Port health is the collective term for the management of health activities at international transport terminals under various public health regulations. It aims to manage health risks associated with the movement of people and goods through air, sea and rail ports (HPA, 2006: 7). The resultant practices are overseen by the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) across national, regional and local scales, and enacted in localities by various public, private and voluntary sector agencies. Significantly, the appointment of Port Medical Officers (PMOs) - medically-qualified staff responsible for communicable disease control at ports \u2013 is the responsibility of local authorities (HPA, 2006). Other partners include local police, general practitioners, airline and airport staff, PCTs, and national security and immigration services (for example, private security contractors and the UK Border Agency (UKBA)) (HPA, 2006).",

Moreover, guidelines for managing communicable disease spread at airports have been developed by industry bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (ICAO, 2009) and Airports Council International (ACI) (ACI, 2009). In England, health controls on aircraft and at airports are contained within three statutes: Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations 1979, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and the Public Health (Aircraft) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2007. The regulations define the measures that should be taken at airports with respect to arriving and departing passengers, crew, and aircraft to limit any potential risks to public health and reduce the spread of infection. These interventions include the medical examination of potential entrants to the UK, the grounding of aircraft and, if required, the detention of passengers, crew, cargo, and equipment until local health authorities are satisfied that no disease threat exists (HPA, 2006).",

To achieve this, we draw on the concept of distributed preparedness, examining recent UK initiatives aimed at improving local interventions during a particular event - the 2009\u201310 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Distributed preparedness considers preparedness interventions enacted across a number of geographical scales within a state\u2019s territory. The majority of work in this field has been conducted in the US, where distributed preparedness has been described as \u2018the development of an organizational framework and set of techniques for approaching security threats\u2019 (Collier & Lakoff, 2008: 7). Its antecedents are located in the broader post World War Two civil defence planning, where it was developed to counter the possibility of nuclear attack. In this context, it \u2018presented a new model of coordinated planning for catastrophic threats\u2019, with a spatial focus on interventions utilising resources and infrastructure situated in the locality, as well as nationally (Collier & Lakoff, 2008: 7, 11). In recent decades, distributed preparedness work has broadened to consider domains such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, financial regulation and pandemic influenza (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, Thompson, 2010).",

These disease occurrences focused attention on measures enacted in specific localities against pathogens that could enter the country at multiple sites and the extent to which communities could prepare for \u2018biological \u2019unknown unknowns\u2019\u2019 which may appear from anywhere and could have potentially catastrophic effects (Braun, 2007: 18). Political developments include contentious reforms of UK healthcare provision by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat administration which took office in May 2010. Although the scale, and pace, of implementation of these measures has been reduced following a public consultation during April\u2013June 2011, the changes will result in the abolition of the HPA in April 2013 and the transfer of its functions to the Department of Health (DH).

Second, we considered collaborative working with external organisations across local, regional and national scales. Potential partners included local authorities, PCTs, HPUs, Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs), the Department for Health and the UKBA. In this section of the interview schedule/questionnaire, we asked questions about the history of any collaborative working and sought clarity on professional boundaries and organisational responsibilities.

For instance, the HPU Port Health Lead in this case study area had established \u2018two or three years ago\u2019 a port health meeting, held every 12 weeks. Attendants at this forum discussed \u2018normal\u2019 (i.e. non-emergency) port health functions, for example,\u2018\u2026assessing the structures and partnerships in place, the funding available, how they had operated in the past, how they were going to operate in the future\u2019 (HPU, Port Health Lead)\n",

The revised system had been tested by three incidents, two involving children with rashes (\u2018suspected chickenpox\u2019) and the third concerning an adult passenger who appeared to be \u2018quite drowsy\u2019 and \u2018unresponsive\u2019. In these cases, standard procedure involved the airline pilot radioing in to the airport Terminal Duty Manager, who in turn telephoned the HPU, using a specific contact number. This system of a single point of contact at each port - a recommendation of the 2005 Review - had been in place in case study A for \u2018two, maybe three\u2019 years. Only one of the three incidents (the first suspected chickenpox call) resulted in a direct intervention at the airport, a \u2018high level\u2019 response which the interviewee implied was unnecessary and, ostensibly, due to the \u2018inexperience\u2019 of the HPU practitioner who took the call. This view on the general robustness of port health procedures in the particular locality was shared, to varying degrees, by the partner organisations interviewed. Airport A and the neighbouring LA were trenchant in their support for the port health measures. At the same time, a Deputy Director based at the PCT in direct contact with Airport A stated that, whilst his organisation \u2018did not have formal responsibility for port health\u2019, it would be \u2018as helpful as it can\u2019 during port health incidents, providing \u2018surge capacity when necessary\u2019 in the form of additional staff, including district nurses.

These nodes have emerged following air travel liberalisation, as regional airports - across the globe - increasingly host international flights (Maertens, 2010). We argue that these transformations in international passenger air travel have significant implications for the geographies of public health preparedness. Moreover, these changing patterns of aeromobility have been complicated by UK government reforms, including the proposed devolution of many of the PCT functions to multiple GP-led consortia and the absorption of the work of the HPA into the DH.

Among some agencies, there was uncertainty over port health responsibilities, whilst specific actors were unwilling to compromise on what they interpreted as their professional roles. For example, the PCT in case study B appeared unsure about the actions it should take in the event of an infectious disease entering its locality via the airport. During the H1N1 pandemic, this perceived lack of effective formalised organisational port health procedures resulted in localised disputes over the extent to which the PCT should provide nursing assistance to allow the HPU to conduct patient swabbing. In case study A, the tensions were less overt. Nevertheless, the HPU Port Health Lead for this locality, stated that their organisation felt the need to shoulder the burden during the early weeks of the H1N1 outbreak: \u2018when this hit, [the PCT] weren\u2019t ready to mobilise their resources, and we stepped in\u2026\u2019.",

There was evidence, nevertheless, of territorial competition between central and local control. Preparedness plans made at the local scale, for example by a PCT, frequently fed into multi-agency plans covering a larger geographical area, often a county or group of counties. This work directly linked to central government guidance, for example, the DH\u2019s National Framework. Conceptually, these proposed interventions, involving a number of agencies, were \u2018distributed\u2019 across various scales, from the town hall to government department. However, when the H1N1 influenza pandemic occurred, this approach was not put into practice. Instead, there appeared to be a lack of coordinated risk communication across agencies. In spite of the local and regional plans, central government \u2013 most notably the DH \u2013 took charge at a very early stage. Agencies operating at a local level variously described the \u2018tearing up\u2019 of local plans and the \u2018changing [of] rules\u2019 (Risk Manager, PCT, case study B). It was an approach that appeared to be antithetical to the changing nature of the UK border and the uneven geographical spread of the virus across the UK, identified in the Hine Report (Hine, 2010). Whilst tensions between health policy formulations across geographical scales has been discussed elsewhere (McLafferty, 2010), our empirical study captured the temporal changes, as a national government sought to exercise control from the \u2018centre\u2019 during a period of \u2018crisis\u2019 (Anderson, 2009). Moreover, central government plans to administer directly the HPA\u2019s health protection role suggested that much work is required if distributed preparedness interventions are to be enacted during the next pandemic.",

            "text": "Third, we found that representations of the regional airport as a significant international border through which tens of thousands of non-EEA travellers enter the UK each year (CAA, 2011) did not register with the majority of participants operating within the communities surrounding this bounded geographical area. The Director of the HPU in case study B referred to the airport within its boundaries, which handled in excess of 500,000 non-EEA passengers a year, as \u2018small\u2019 (\u2019it\u2019s not Heathrow\u2019). Participants from other organisations also appeared to downplay the significance of the airport as a point of entry for disease, referring to the low number of port health cases identified each year and the general ineffectiveness of mass, pre-emptive screening processes. Whilst reaction to the latter is understandable, in view of contentious screening interventions aimed at identifying diseases in the UK (tuberculosis) and in Canada and parts of Asia (SARS) (Ali and Keil, 2006, HPA, 2006), it is nevertheless surprising, given the means by which H1N1 Influenza was deemed to have entered the UK. Following our investigation, and building on international studies on this topic (St Michael\u2019s Hospital, 2009), therefore, we call for a renewed focus on the regional airport (and on the origin of journey of international passengers), with a view to improving port health provision, both at the airport and within the surrounding community. This would help inform debates in other countries where international airports located outside of global cities have proved to be nodes for virus transfer. It was notable, for example, that the global spread of H1N1 during 2009\u20132010 was facilitated as much through \u2018resort\u2019 and regional airports (Cancun, Mexico and Birmingham, UK, respectively) as via major international sites (Chang et al., 2010). In order to be effective, any future preparedness interventions need to, in our view, pay greater attention to the bounded, and contested, geographies in which agencies serving these localities operate. Moreover, they need to take greater account of the specific requirements of aviation and note the industry relevant guidance from international agencies such as the WHO, ICAO and ACI. A more nuanced understanding of the tensions between local and national policy formulations in practice may result in more coordinated national \u2013 and transnational - approaches to \u2018distributed preparedness\u2019.",
