Patients infected by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed symptoms of fever and dyspnoea, lymphopenia, and ground\u2010glass lung changes in radiology.\n2\n, \n3\n Severe cases developed life\u2010threatening complications, such as respiratory failure, shock, and multiple organs dysfunction.\n4\n We report on an identified unique severe case involving co\u2010infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and HIV.",

The patient was a heavy smoker of between 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. He had also been diagnosed with type II diabetes 2 year ago and received alogliptin co\u2010administered with metformin. The body temperature was 37.5\u00b0C. The clinic physician ordered blood routine test and chest computed tomography (CT), and was confirmed to have a mild lymphopenia with a lymphocyte count of 1.1 \u00d7 109/L. The chest CT indicated the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia with findings of multiple ground\u2010glass opacities (GGO) in bilateral lungs (Figure 1A). He was kept in isolation at home and separated from his family members. Due to the shortage of the test kits, real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay for detection of coronavirus RNA was performed on his throat swabs on 3 February, which confirmed a positive result. From 1 to 4 February, apart from fever and cough, the patient developed shortness of breath. The follow\u2010up Chest CT displayed progressive GGO and consolidation in lungs (Figure 1B). On 4 February, he was referred, quarantined and treated in Wuhan Tongji Sino\u2010French New Town Hospital, a designated medical institution for the novel coronavirus infection.",

On supplemental oxygen, arterial blood gas analysis revealed: pH 7.41, PCO2 37.4 mm Hg, PO2 63.9 mm Hg, and HCO3\u2212 23.4 mmol/L. Lymphopenia also got worse, with a lymphocyte count of 0.56 \u00d7 109/L and a low CD4+ T\u2010lymphocyte percentage at 4.75%. An antigen/antibody combination test on blood gave HIV\u2010positive result. Oral therapy with an anti\u2010HIV drug, lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg per dose twice daily for 12 days, as was advised by Chinese health authority for the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, was started on admission.\n5\n The patient also received moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 7 days, \u03b3\u2010globulin 400 mg/kg once daily for 3 days, and methilprednisolone 0.8 mg/kg once daily for 3 days through intravenous route. On 9 February, the patient showed a marked clinical and radiological improvement (Figure 1C). His oxygen saturation measured by pulse maintained above 95% on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Two additional throat swabs were obtained on 15 February and both were tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RT\u2010PCR assay. The patient was in stable condition and discharged on 17 February. He was asked to keep isolated at home for two more weeks.",
