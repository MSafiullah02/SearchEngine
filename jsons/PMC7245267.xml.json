            "text": "Residency training and fellowship programs have been drastically affected. This is due, first of all, to the lack of medical personnel in many hospitals, which has forced many residents and specialists to work in special COVID-19 units. Secondly, the lack of medical care activity related to sexual medicine has drastically reduced the possibilities of training. For instance, a recent study carried out among Italian urology residents during the COVID-19 period found that the percentage of residents experiencing a severe reduction (>40%) or complete suppression (>80%) of training exposure ranged between 41.1% and 81.2% for \u201cclinical\u201d activities, and between 44.2% and 62.1% for \u201csurgical\u201d activities. This reduction was even more pronounced for residents attending the final year of training(6). This has forced many departments to reinvent themselves, using new information technologies as a tool to stay in touch with the specialty.",

The annual congresses of various scientific societies and other scientific events have had to be cancelled, postponed or change to a virtual format. Sexual medicine will need to be taught based on new online training platforms, combining training in clinical care, surgical and research abilities. Virtual contact between departments will also be necessary to exchange experiences. Webinars, interactive online congresses, virtual meetings, etc. will undoubtedly become the main source of training in times of pandemic.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has concentrated the efforts of many scientists to learn about and treat the disease in a way never before seen in medicine. Many medical trials related to COVID-19 have been produced in record time (around 1000 studies registered at clinicaltrials.gov), which hopefully will soon provide results(7). But at the same time, many other studies that were underway have been limited or interrupted. Recruiting new patients or the clinical monitoring of those already included in these studies has become seriously hampered, so a delay in the publication of their results is to be expected. Furthermore, the economic crisis that will result from the pandemic may limit public and private resources allocated to research. That is why sexual medicine must be prepared for an environment where obtaining resources will become more competitive.",

Beyond its health and economic impact, the COVID-19 pandemic will also bring about social changes in our society. But given that sexual medicine is a consolidated specialty and that throughout its history it has demonstrated its ability to adapt to new challenges, it will surely emerge stronger from this situation so that we can improve the care for our patients.",
