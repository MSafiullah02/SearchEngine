Medical and surgical procedures are therefore considered to put practitioners and nursing staff at high risk when they come into contact with patients either confirmed or suspected to have Covid-19 [1] . In countries already affected by the pandemic, preparing for the epidemic wave or living with the virus, specific recommendations have been necessary to adapt ENT indications and medical-surgical procedures to the pandemic. In France, estimating an R0 of Covid-19 at around 3 justified postponing non-urgent face-to-face consultations and expanding the use of teleconsultation in order to limit the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients or health workers and comply with the lockdown. In response to Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) Messages from the This article proposes guidelines that will need to be adapted according to the region and preexisting arrangements. ENT specialists, in collaboration with the operational hygiene teams and all other specialties involved, should circulate these guidelines as appropriate for their organizations (dedicated treatment routes for Covid-positive patients, establishment of non-COVID-19 areas of the hospital) and adapt them as appropriate.",

For a number of reasons it is impossible to establish exhaustive lists of treatments that should be continued or postponed during the Covid-19 pandemic: varying degrees of severity for the same pathology; associated co-morbidities; the patient's wishes; local availability of operating theatres, intensive care and continuing care units, or medical and paramedical staff. Some surgical emergencies must of course be treated without delay: severe traumas, infections and abscesses that are complicated or which fail to respond to medical treatment, foreign bodies and severe obstructions of the upper airway, ingestions of caustic substances. Conversely, some procedures can be postponed, such as facial plastic surgery.
