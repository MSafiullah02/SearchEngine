The outcomes of these viral infections can be significantly influenced by immune responses at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, including the recruitment of innate immune cells, and the activation of T cells and antibody responses (Murphy, 1994, Virgin, 2007, Woodland and Randall, 2004). As such, there is intense interest in developing vaccination strategies and viral vectors that promote strong and long lasting protective immune responses against viral respiratory tract pathogens. This is particularly important for viral infections in different anatomical regions of the respiratory tract, since the mechanisms controlling immunity in these airway compartments can differ significantly (Woodland and Randall, 2004). The overall goal of the work described here was to determine the capacity of viral vectors based on parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) to elicit protection against lethal respiratory tract infection by vaccinia virus (VACV).",

While a live attenuated form of VACV is currently used in the United States as a licensed smallpox vaccine, a number of concerns have been raised due to risk of adverse effects of this vaccine (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2009). VACV also presents major challenges to the development of alternative vaccination approaches that are based on purified VACV proteins and heterologous vectors expressing VACV antigens (Moss, 2006). First, VACV exists in two major infectious forms: the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) and the intracellular mature virion (IMV). Importantly, the VACV antigens that are critical for neutralization of these two forms differ (Fogg et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2000). For example, L1R is a myristoylated transmembrane protein in the IMV form and is an important target for IMV neutralization (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005b, Franke et al., 1990, Wolffe et al., 1995). B5R is a membrane-anchored VACV protein with an extracellular domain containing regions that are related to some complement regulatory proteins (Engelstad et al., 1992). Antibodies against B5R are important for neutralization of the EEV form (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005a, Bell et al., 2004, Galmiche et al., 1999). Because antibodies that neutralize the IMV do not neutralize the EEV, it is thought that immunization with antigens from both of these forms is necessary for maximum protection (Lustig et al., 2005).",

Finally, the VACV antigens that are important for control of infections initiated through the respiratory tract versus systemic routes (intravenous or intraperitoneal) can differ, and the immune mechanisms for protection from these different routes of infection are not completely understood (Belyakov et al., 2005, Kaufman et al., 2008).",

Our previous work in both mouse and ferret model systems has shown that intranasal (I.N.) delivery of PIV5 induces a potent antibody response, and that PIV5 is cleared from respiratory tissues by 7\u20139 days pi without evidence of systemic infection (Capraro et al., 2008). Likewise, PIV5 vectors expressing model antigens can elicit strong and long lasting T cell responses which can display a high avidity phenotype (Gray et al., 2003, Parks and Alexander-Miller, 2002). Importantly, vaccination of both ferrets and mice with recombinant PIV5 vectors did not result in overt pathology and there was no evidence of disease symptoms (Capraro et al., 2008). These desirable properties raise the potential use of PIV5 vectors as vaccines against complex human pathogens which infect the respiratory tract.",

Similar to previous data with VSV-based vectors (Braxton et al., 2010), B5R was expressed at a somewhat higher level than L1R. Examination of extracellular media (Fig. 1B, right panel) showed very efficient time-dependent released of B5R. By contrast, most of L1R was retained within the cell similar to that seen in the case of the control cytoplasmic protein thymidine kinase (TK) expressed from a PIV5 vector (Parks et al., 2002). Longer exposures showed a low level of extracellular L1R protein, consistent with secretion of this protein when linked to a signal peptide (Shinoda et al., 2009).",

On day 28 post boost, mice were challenged with VACV equivalent to 20 MTD50 by I.N. administration. Nasal tissue and the olfactory lobes of the brain were analyzed on day 7 post challenge by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Control mice immunized with a sublethal dose of VACV showed intact nasal epithelium and clear nasal cavity (Fig. 3\n, panels A and B). By contrast, PBS-treated mice showed inflammatory exudate (panel C) filling much of the nasal cavity with a bilateral extension through the cribiform plate into the adjacent olfactory lobes (white arrows, panel C). There was extensive destruction of the nasal epithelium (black arrows, panel D), with inflammatory cells being present in submucosa and in the nasal cavity. For mice immunized with the PIV5 vectors, VACV challenge resulted in small amounts of exudates seen in the nasal cavity but there was no extension into the brain region (Fig. 3, panel E). Higher magnification showed only very low levels of inflammatory cells in the exudates and only minimal disruption of the nasal epithelium (panel F). PIV5 immunized animals showed no significant lesions in lung tissue or other organs including heart, liver, kidney and spleen (not shown). Together, these data indicate that mice immunized with PIV5-L1R and -B5R vectors show relatively low levels of pathology in the nasal tissue at day 7 post VACV challenge compared to control animals that succumb to VACV infection.",

On days 4, 8 and 12 post challenge, the titer of VACV in lung tissues was determined by plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 4\n, no VACV was detected in tissues from control mice given the sublethal dose of VACV, and this was consistent with the lack of disease symptoms in these animals. PBS-treated mice had high VACV titers in the lung tissue until day 8 when they succumbed to infection (# in Fig. 4 denotes no animals survived). Importantly, mice immunized with the PIV5-L1R and -B5R vectors had VACV titers in lung tissues that were ~ 1 log lower than that seen in PBS treated control mice on days 4 and 8. By day 12 after challenge, there was no detectable VACV in lungs of mice immunized with PIV5 vectors (* samples at D12, Fig. 4). Given the kinetics of weight loss after VACV challenge of PIV5-immunized mice which begins by day 4, reaches a low point by day 8, and approaches normal levels by day 12, these results suggest that recovery from disease symptoms and protection from lethality correlate with clearance of VACV from lung tissue.",

Eighteen days after boosting with PIV5 vectors, CD8+ cells were depleted from mice for 4 consecutive days by daily administration of an anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody as detailed in Materials and methods. Flow cytometric analysis showed that anti-CD8 treatment resulted in a decrease of CD8+, CD3+ (CD8+ T cells) to less than 1% of total splenic cells (data not shown). After I.N. challenge with 20 MTD50 of VACV, mice were monitored for lethality and disease symptoms. As shown in Fig. 5A, PBS-treated control mice succumbed to lethal infection by days 8\u201310 (closed triangles), whereas all of the CD8-depleted mice that had been immunized with PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors were completely protected (open circles). Some CD8-depleted control mice that had received a single sublethal dose of VACV also succumbed to VACV challenge (closed squares), a finding that is consistent with previous reports for a role of cellular immunity in the case of some VACV infections (Belyakov et al., 2005, Wyatt et al., 2004). Although PIV5 immunized mice were protected from lethality they still showed disease symptoms such as hunching and loss of weight (data not shown). For PIV5-immunized mice, the magnitude of weight loss (~ 20\u201325%) and kinetics of weight loss (maximal at day 8 post challenge) were very similar to that seen without CD8 depletion (data not shown).

Likewise, BAL fluid was tested in ELISA for antigen-specific IgA and IgG responses.",

This result contrasts with anti-L1R and anti-B5R responses elicited by sublethal VACV infection which has been shown previously in this same ELISA system to produce titers of 106 and 105, respectively (Braxton et al., 2010). Similarly, the PIV5 vectors elicited anti-L1R and anti-B5R IgA and IgG titers in BAL that were at or below the limit of detection in this ELISA (Fig. 6B). This low BAL Ig titer against L1R and B5R contrasted with very strong anti-PIV5 IgA and IgG titers in BAL (Fig. 6C) which averaged 103 and 104, respectively.

It is noteworthy that assaying these dilutions of serum in vitro may give a biased view relative to the undiluted nature of blood. By contrast, sera from control mice immunized with PBS showed no significant reduction in plaques (Fig. 6E).

The I.N. infection route was chosen here based on the need for new vaccines to protect against aerosolized VACV which may have different requirements for protection from challenge by other routes (Kaufman et al., 2008) and the assumption that parainfluenza viruses would elicit the most robust responses by infection through the respiratory route. Our results indicate that PIV5 vectors expressing the VACV L1R and B5R proteins confer long lasting protective immunity against lethal I.N. VACV challenge. Protection from VACV-mediated lethality required a prime plus boost immunization protocol administered by the I.N. route, depended on B cells but not CD8+ cells and was capable of protecting mice for longer than 1.5 years after immunization. While immunization with vectors expressing B5R alone conferred at least some protection, the most effective immunization involved PIV5 expressing L1R alone or in combination with B5R. Taken together these results support the further development of PIV5-based vectors for immunization against highly pathogenic and complex human viruses such as poxviruses.",

            "text": "Mice responded to our PIV5 vectors by generating high ELISA titers of antibodies to the PIV5 vector and but relatively low ELISA titers of antibodies to VACV L1R and B5R proteins. We have previously shown that WT PIV5 elicits a very strong anti-PIV5 antibody response detected in serum (Capraro et al., 2008) and here we extend this analysis to include very high anti-PIV5 IgG and IgA responses in BAL (Fig. 6). By contrast, results from ELISA data showed that the serum antibody responses to L1R and B5R were at low levels and were not detectable in BAL (Fig. 6). This is consistent with previous work showing that the L1R and B5R proteins are poorly immunogenic when expressed outside of the context of the native VACV. This is also reflected in the need for multiple vaccinations with pure L1R and B5R proteins to generate high antibody titers that provide protection (Berhanu et al., 2008, Braxton et al., 2010, Delaney et al., 2010, Fogg et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2000, Xiao et al., 2007). It is known that there is an initial innate response in mouse lung to PIV5 infection. However, as we have shown that PIV5 is cleared from the respiratory tract by 9 days after infection (Capraro et al., 2008), it is unlikely that an innate response to the vector contributes substantially to protection from lethal VACV infection. This is further supported by the key findings that protection requires B cells and that mice are protected up to 1\u00bd years after immunization with the PIV5 vectors. Importantly however, the PIV5 vectors elicited protection in mice that was dependent on B cells and generated functional anti-VACV antibody titers were easily detected during in vitro neutralization assays (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). These data suggest that PIV5 vectors elicit memory B cells that respond to secondary exposure during VACV challenge by increasing levels of neutralizing anti-VACV antibodies. Alternatively, protection from VACV challenge could involve antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-mediated cell lysis, both of which are dependent on antibodies to VACV proteins. The role of complement in VACV protection has been shown previously (Benhnia et al., 2009), and is currently being tested in the context of PIV5-based vectors.",

VACV infection required a prime and a boost immunization administered by the I.N. route. This may reflect a higher level or prolonged expression of antigens in the airways of mice infected with VSV vectors compared to PIV5 vectors. In view of the finding that the anti-PIV5 antibody response to primary I.N. infection of mice is very strong (titer of ~ 104, Capraro et al., 2008), it is somewhat surprising that a boost with the same PIV5 vectors promoted protection from VACV challenge. This is particularly true of anti-PIV5 titers in the BAL, which were very high for IgA. Work is in progress to define the mechanism by which boosting with the PIV5 vectors influences protection from VACV challenge even in the face of a strong response due to prior exposure to PIV5.",

This was most notable in PIV5-immunized mice by the loss of weight starting at days 3\u20134, but this was also evident by signs of illness such as hunching, ruffled fur, conjunctivitis, labored breathing, lethargy and unresponsiveness to stimulus (not shown). Importantly, the kinetics of appearance of illness in PIV5-immunized mice was delayed and less severe compared to control PBS-treated animals, and the PIV5-immunized animals showed an improvement to near normal properties by day 12 post challenge. Similar results have been shown for animals vaccinated with purified VACV proteins (Delaney et al., 2010, Fogg et al., 2004) and with VSV-based vectors expressing L1R and B5R (Braxton et al., 2010), where immunized animals lost weight following VACV challenge even though they were protected from lethality. The disease symptoms in PIV5-immunized animals could reflect a delay in response of memory B cells in PIV5 immunized animals to VACV antigens during the challenge. Additional possibilities include a lower immune response to PIV5-based vaccination due to the fact that PIV5 immunized animals are exposed to only two of the multiple antigenic proteins that expressed during a VACV infection (Berhanu et al., 2008, Fogg et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2000), or to alternative conformations of B5R and L1R when expressed from PIV5 versus bone fide VACV infection. In the latter case, we engineered expression of soluble versions of L1R and B5R to enhance release from infected cells and possible uptake of secreted antigen. However, as the immunogenicity of L1R is particularly sensitive to conformational changes (Su et al., 2007), PIV5-expressed L1R may not elicit strong antibody responses due to its expression as an HA-tagged cytoplasmic protein.",

These desirable PIV5 properties including infections are largely noncytopathic in most cell types, and that PIV5 is not associated with any disease in humans (Goswami et al., 1984). In ferrets and mice, PIV5 stimulates strong antibody and T cell responses, is cleared from respiratory tissues by 7\u20139 days pi without evidence of systemic infection (Capraro et al., 2008) and induces no overt pathology. As discussed previously (Capraro et al., 2008), the ferret model may be a more appropriate system for analysis of features of the PIV5 vectors, since the mouse is not a good predictor of viral permissiveness/tropism in humans. PIV5 can elicit strong systemic mucosal IgG and IgA responses, even when delivered by different routes. PIV5 is grown to very high titers (> 1010\n PFU/ml) in Vero cells, an approved cell line for vaccine work. Finally, anti-PIV5 sero-prevalence can be relatively low in many human populations (Hsiung, 1972, Johnson et al., 2008). A PIV5 vector was shown to elicit protective immunity in mice against influenza virus (Tompkins et al., 2007), although the mechanism of protection in that study was not addressed.",

PIV5 variants have been isolated from samples from human patients (Chatziandreou et al., 2004).

Likewise, we have shown that PIV5 vectors based on RNA synthesis mutants are potent activators of innate and adaptive immunity (Capraro et al., 2008, Manuse and Parks, 2009). These results with PIV5 variants support the general hypothesis that paramyxovirus vectors can be designed to express a target antigen along with immuno-modulatory factors that elicit a broader response to protect against both lethality as well as reduce disease symptoms.",
