In many countries, numerous treaties were adopted to specify the intention of the states to protect the citizens.[2] These treaties were based on different aspects of socioeconomic events such as birth and death, production of food and other consumables, living conditions, the health of special population groups, environmental hazards like flood and drought, man-made crises like war and famine, and so on.[12] With evolving specialization of the working classes and administrative wings, \u201cmodern policing\u201d emerged with a conception of protecting lawful rights of the citizens and fostering justice in unwanted situations.[3]",

Earlier in India, several incidences of the outbreak of diseases [Table 1] have drawn the attention of national and global institutions which can be used as examples to illustrate the severity of such emergencies in this context. These episodes of public health emergencies necessitate immediate medical support; however, the public health professionals would also adopt additional approaches to identify the sources, mechanisms, and modes of transmission of the outbreak and devise appropriate strategies to stop the outbreak and prevent future incidences. Even if the fatality due to some natural disasters might be comparatively lower, the quality of living of those affected is often compromised to a large extent; which eventually leads to poor health outcomes. Being a geographically diverse country, India has experienced numerous natural disasters in the past. A list of notable natural disasters in India is presented in Table 2. In addition to these disasters and outbreaks as described earlier, global crises like the outbreak of newer diseases or conditions can affect the population health in India due to population dynamics. Moreover, the entire world is moving toward a digital revolution where patient data and much confidential information can be manipulated, breaching the medical and legal boundaries, which can result in varying problems in coming days.[17]",

Law enforcement representatives will have to work with officials from other community agencies as well, to ensure that their pandemic communication plans complement and support each other. All stakeholders should be informed ahead of time about the risks posed by such a pandemic, how to prepare for one, and how law enforcement's role will change as the situation unfolds.[19] Essentially, all these emergencies would require strategies such as community mobilization, isolation of the cases and/or places, maintenance of logistic support, ensuring the security of the materials and other resources, exploring possible foul play behind the outbreak, and so on. In the context of India, law enforcement agencies can play a critical role to accomplish these goals and facilitate the fundamental strategies to be implemented and thereby the well-being of the population to be achieved.[20] Further, it is necessary to compare different aspects of public health and law enforcement agencies to determine future discourse of how these institutions can contribute individually and collectively. A comparative analysis of the same (discussed in greater detail by Bulter et al.[21]) is presented in Table 3.",

Another challenge would be sharing the resources and optimizing the operational aspects of such collaborations.

Therefore, evidence-based standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be developed for different cadres of professionals, keeping harmony with the operational diversities.[24] These SOPs should be designed based on the context-specific data focusing on the preparedness toward the emergencies. Moreover, different kind of emergencies should be evaluated thoroughly to make the SOPs resilient to emerging problems. More importantly, timely monitoring and learning exercises can promote accountability at individual and institutional levels and facilitate future improvisation initiatives. Furthermore, the health of those working together to make lives better requires cautious attention.[21] People from both institutions should understand the medical and legal aspects of an emergency and protect themselves from potential harms. For instance, if we consider a pandemic flu outbreak as a potential scenario, the pandemic will affect how the local law enforcement agencies operate. It is predicted by some experts that the percentage of employees affected in some way during a flu pandemic (e.g., exposed, infected, or unable to work because of responsibilities toward sick family members) will range from 10% to 40%, and as a result, departments will lose staff members.[25] Agencies will need to activate their internal emergency operations\u2019 plans, prioritizing and shifting resources to the most critical operations. Calls for service will likely increase dramatically; however, with fewer officers available to work, response time will suffer, and services will be reduced. Problems like this are often ignored which results in mortalities and morbidities that could be prevented with timely interventions.",
