            "text": "Enteric diseases remain as a remarkable worldwide public health problem. Around 200 million people suffer gastroenteritis daily and more than 2 million people die annually due to such infections in developing countries, mainly infants (WHO 2010). Prominent pathogens causing enteric diseases include adenovirus; astro-virus; rotavirus; Campylobacteria; Shigella; Salmonella; E. coli; and Vibrios, particularly V. cholerae (Girard et al. 2006). Enteric pathogens are transmitted as a consequence of inadequate sanitation in both water and food, conditions that will prevail in developing countries (WHO 2017). Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the most common bacterium-causing diarrhea (Walker et al. 2007). Annually, ETEC affects around 400 million people and is responsible for 300,000\u2013500,000 deaths (Zheng et al. 2005). V. cholerae is responsible for 3\u20135 million of infections and about 100,000\u2013130,000 deaths per year (WHO 2010). Salmonella persists as a major public health threat related to the consumption of poultry in developed countries (Majowicz et al. 2010). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2008) estimates that Salmonella causes 1.4 million of infections and about 600 deaths each year in the United States. In Asian countries such as Japan, V. parahaemolyticus is associated with 30% of food-related poisonings (Broberg et al. 2011) due to the high consumption of undercooked fish and shellfish (Datta et al. 2008); this pathogen is also considered one of the biggest economic problems in aquaculture (Liu et al. 2011a, b).",

Vaccination is a viable alternative to prevent enteric infections and thus decrease the associated morbidity and mortality. To achieve this goal, developing low cost oral vaccines is critical in view to the budget limitations that often reduce vaccination coverage (Walker et al. 2007). In fact, oral immunization for enteric diseases is highly convenient since it leads to humoral responses in the gastrointestinal tract, which constitutes the site of entry of enteric pathogens; thus vaccines based in this approach are viable.",

New computer and molecular technologies allow the generation of multiepitopic recombinant vaccines capable of triggering immunity against several pathogens using a single antigen (Ruan et al. 2015). Another challenge in this field is the poor immunogenic activity that is often observed for subunit vaccines, thus requiring adjuvants to induce proper immune responses in terms of potency and type (Chauhan et al. 2017). Several proteins have been applied for this purpose, including the B subunits of cholera toxin (CTB) or the heat labile enterotoxin (LTB) from ETEC, which are potent mucosal adjuvants (Adkins et al. 2012; Al-Barwani et al. 2014). The immunogenic characteristics of LTB and CTB result in part from their ability to bind the GM1 receptor that facilitates the antigen reaching the submucosa, and favors uptake by dendritic cell as well as B and T cells effector functions (Yamamoto et al. 2001).",

In addition, the B subunit of the LT toxin produced by ETEC was included as an immunogenic carrier. To avoid undesired junctional epitopes and to provide appropriate folding/display for immune recognition, a proline-containing linker (GPGP) was incorporated between the LTB sequence and the target epitopes (Livingston et al. 2002). The signal peptide sequence of the vegetative storage protein from Glycine max was incorporated at the N-terminus of the fusion protein whereas an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (SEKDEL) was included at the C-terminus. The gene sequence was flanked with the SacI and SmaI restriction sites to facilitate subcloning into the pBI121 binary vector downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter (Fig. 1). The LTBentero coding gene was codon-optimized for plants and synthesized by GenScript\u00ae (Piscataway, NJ). Subcloning was performed under conventional procedures to yield the construct named pBI121LTBentero. The recombinant plasmid obtained in E. coli Top 10 was identified by restriction analysis with the enzyme HindIII and then transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101 strain) by electroporation. A positive A. tumefaciens clone was propagated and used for tobacco transformation experiments.",

            "text": "In the present study the design and expression in plants of a multiepitopic protein targeting several enteric pathogens was achieved as an approach to generate an attractive polyvalent oral vaccine candidate. This plant-based multiepitopic protein was designed based on immunoprotective epitopes from the following enteric pathogens: ETEC, V. parahaemolyticus, and S. typhimurium (Jacob et al. 1983, 1985; Newton et al. 1989; Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2011; Zha et al. 2016; Bergman et al. 2005; Kremer et al. 2011). LTB was chosen as the carrier of the multiepitopic arrangement for two reasons: (1) its immune-enhancing capacity in mucous membranes (Yamamoto et al. 2001), and (2) it is known to serve as immunmoprotective antigen against LT and CT toxins from ETEC and V. cholerae, respectively (Nashar et al. 2001). Although ST causes severe diarrhea, it is a small peptide that lacks of immunogenic activity itself. However, ST can become immunogenic when is coupled to other antigens, such as LTB (Girard et al. 2006; Klipstein et al. 1986; Pereira et al. 2001). In addition, an epitope from the S. typhimurium fliC flagellin was selected; this sequence is highly conserved in the genus Salmonella (Bergman et al. 2005). An epitope from the V. parahaemolyticus outer membrane protein (OMP) LptD was also incorporated; this protein is part of a large complex that is responsible for producing Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cell membrane of these bacteria. On this regard, Zha et al. (2016) reported antibodies able to block LptD by binding to different sites and decreased LPS production with a subsequent bacterial clearance.",

The modified tobacco plants carrying the ltbentero gene were obtained and confirmed by PCR. Dot blot analysis allowed the detection of the protein whereas its expected molecular weight (28 kDa) was confirmed by Western blot analysis. According to ELISA data, LTBentero expression levels ranged 0.029\u20135.29 \u00b5g g\u22121 FW, which are in the range (24.5\u20132 \u00b5g g\u22121 ) of the observed yields for LTB or CTB chimeras produced in tobacco, lettuce, tomato, and Arabidopsis thaliana (R\u00edos-Huerta et al. 2017; Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2011; Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2011; Rigano et al. 2004; Walmsley et al. 2003). The difference in antigen yields among the transformed lines may be due to differential transgene insertion sites into the tobacco genome (Kim et al. 2007). Although there is an apparent lack of correlation between the expression levels determined by ELSIA and the band intensity observed in the Western blot analysis, it should be considered that ELISA is a more accurate technique in which several serial dilutions were analyzed, whereas in western blot a single dilution containing a fixed amount of total protein was analyzed and thus the detected signal could be masked by saturation effects (Bass et al. 2016). Therefore, the selection of the most productive line was based on ELISA data.",

Interestingly, high levels of systemic IgG antibodies were observed in both subcutaneously and orally immunized mice after the second immunization against LTB or ST and after third immunization for LptD. Regarding IgA mucosal production, high levels of antibodies against LTB and ST were detected after the third subcutaneous and oral immunization (except for anti-LTB in orally immunized mice). The immunogenic properties observed for the LTBentero chimeric protein suggests that it was correctly assembled and functionally produced in the plant cell. LTB is recognized as a mucosal adjuvant related with its efficient uptake by epithelial and dendritic cells, which favors the induction of adaptive immune responses in the submucosa (Lazorova et al. 1993). Moreover, the adjuvant activity of LTB fused with other peptides in plant-based vaccines has been demonstrated elsewhere (Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2009; Hongli et al. 2013). In line with our findings, significant specific IgG levels in serum and IgA levels in the large intestine were detected in mice after oral immunization with maize and carrot-made LTB (Chikwamba et al. 2002; Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2008). Oral immunogenicity of LTB encapsulated in plant cells has been confirmed in humans (Tacket et al. 1998).",

LTB fused with ST resulted in the induction of ST antibodies in test animals (Saarilahti et al. 1989; Clements 1990; Zheng et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011a, b; You et al. 2011). Interestingly, similar to our results, Deng et al. (2013) immunized mice (with 4 doses at 1-week intervals) with a ST peptide or a ST-LTB fusion protein using nanoparticles as carriers. The authors found a maximum production of specific IgG in serum and IgA in intestinal mucosa against both ST-LTB fusion protein and ST peptide at day 28. Interestingly, a tobacco plant-made LTB:ST protein induced significant anti-LTB IgG (serum) and IgA (feces) levels in orally immunized mice after a third immunization at similar levels to those elicited by the pure recombinant LTB (Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2009, 2011).

            "text": "Interestingly, this constitutes the first report on the immunogenicity of an LptD epitope encapsulated in plant cells. Li et al. (2014) reported LptD from V. parahaemolyticus as a highly immunogenic protein using an immunoproteomic approach. LptD is an integral OMP that along with other 6 proteins (LptA, B, C, E, F and G) constitute a trans-membrane complex responsible for transporting LPS (Freinkman et al. 2012; Xiang et al. 2014). LPS not only plays critical roles in protecting bacteria from harsh environments and in colonizing the host or evading attacks from the host immune system, but also forms a permeation barrier that prevents entering hydrophobic antibiotics to the microorganism, thus conferring antibiotic resistance (Ruiz et al. 2009; Li et al. 2015). Therefore, LptD is an attractive target for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Moreover, Zha et al. (2016) showed that LptD is highly conserved and shared surface epitopes among pathogenic Vibrio species with the ability to induce immunoprotection against Vibrio infection in mice. Remarkably, sera from LptD-immunized mice reduced bacterial growth and LPS levels and increased the bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. In contrast, in this study no significant IgG levels were found in serum against the FliC epitope. However, significant feces anti-FliC IgA levels were observed in mice subjected to four oral immunizations. It is proposed that the FliC is displayed in the context of the chimeric arrangement but optimizing the immunization protocol is required to increase the response against this target epitope. One alternative to be contemplated is combining the use of this plant-made chimeric antigen with boostings performed with a FliC antigen (e.g. a synthetic peptide). Salmonella expresses two types of flagellin (FljB and FliC) known as strong immunogens. FljB has been expressed in plants, being capable to induce humoral responses in subcutaneously immunized mice (Bergeron-Sandoval et al. 2011). The FliC protein flagellar subunit is an antigen capable to induce Th responses via macrophage-mediated presentation, stimulating antibody production; and it has become a candidate for vaccine development because it possesses a broad protective activity against multiple salmonella species (Cummings et al. 2006; Cookson and Beavan 1997; McSorley et al. 2000).",
