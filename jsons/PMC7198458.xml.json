The United States now leads the way, with >370,000 tests performed as of March 26, 2020.1 This level of testing starkly contrasts with low-income economies such as Bangladesh, where an almost contrarian strategy seems to have been adopted that is arguably masking the true national spread of the virus.",

Centralized testing in these underresourced public institutions has been unable to effectively respond to the wave of suspected COVID-19 patients. Even at this initial stage with limited confirmed cases, busy telephone hotlines and lack of timely testing for symptomatic patients raised concerns regarding Bangladesh\u2019s preparedness. In addition, the Bangladesh government has not sought to proactively limit community transmission from primary cases thus far. With a population of 161 million and a total of 1,169 ICU beds,3 this inadequate strategy could potentially devastate Bangladesh\u2019s health system with multiple outbreaks.",

This situation is particularly problematic for Bangladesh because a significant portion of returning workers (ie, significant sources of SARS-CoV-2) reside in rural areas outside Dhaka and thus carry the virus to some of the most vulnerable and ill-equipped communities. This situation was likely worsened by the government declaring a 10-day holiday without travel restrictions from March 26 to April 5, which encouraged millions of city workers to leave Dhaka and return to their rural communities.4\n",

We believe Bangladesh has not yet reached this point, so urgent implementation of a coordinated policy may prevent a spike in cases that is likely to stretch Bangladesh\u2019s health system well beyond its capacity.",
