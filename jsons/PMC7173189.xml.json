            "text": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1 and 3 are members of the Respirovirus genus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family. HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genomes are characterized by a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA of about 15,000 nucleotides encoding for six genes. HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants, young children, and immunocompromised individuals (Apalsch et al., 1995, Henrickson, 2003, Karron et al., 1994, Mufson et al., 1973, Singh-Naz et al., 1990, Welliver et al., 1982, Wendt and Hertz, 1995, Whimbey et al., 1993). At the upper respiratory tract level, HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 infections are associated with pharyngitis, otitis, conjunctivitis, and croup. HPIV-1 is considered to be the most frequent cause of croup. At the lower respiratory level, these viruses are known to cause tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis (a characteristic feature of HPIV-3) and pneumonia (Monto, 1973, Vainionpaa and Hyypia, 1994). Studies suggest that HPIV may cause up to 40% of acute viral respiratory tract illness in children (Reed et al., 1997). In addition, HPIV-3 has been linked also to meningitis in both children (Arguedas et al., 1990, Arisoy et al., 1993) and adults (Vreede et al., 1992). Therefore, due to the clinical impact and the wide geographical distribution of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3, many studies have been conducted to identify a rapid and sensitive HPIV diagnostic tool.",

This new combination (named HPIV-1+3 throughout the paper) represents the first set of common primers\u2013probe designed to regroup HPIV detection. Previous specific HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 single or multiplex RT-PCR detection methods reported in the literature have aimed to target mostly the nucleocapsid (N) or the hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase surface glycoprotein (HN). Based on an extensive alignment including 72 HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 complete and partial sequences available in Genbank, conserved regions between HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 were screened. Although no suitable regions were found within the N and HN coding sequences, this alignment highlighted a short conserved region within the viral polymerase encoding region (L) where primers and probe recognizing both HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 could be identified. Interestingly, this region overlaps two conserved motifs (named B and C) within the catalytic domain for L polymerisation (Poch et al., 1990). Nucleotide sequences of these primers and probe are shown in Table 1\n. Based on this finding, a unique reverse primer (PIV1-3 R) and probe (PIV1-3 probe) were able to be designed to detect all HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genomes, whereas the use of two forward primers (PIV1-3 F1 and PIV1-3 F2) was required. However, PIV1-3 F1 and PIV1-3 F2 are similar in length, position and differ only at three positions in their sequences (Table 1). Primers and probe were screened by NCBI nucleotide BLAST to exclude any cross-reaction with human cellular sequences or other virus targets. Of note, an alignment was performed including all the above-mentioned HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 sequences as well as 20 HPIV-2 sequences (full-length and partial genomes) and the few HPIV-4 partial sequences available in Genbank. Given that these viruses belong to two different genera (HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 belong to the Rubulavirus genus), this alignment did not allow pointing of any common conserved regions either among the four HPIV species genomes, or between HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 species.",

As expected, two and zero mismatches were present between PIV1-3 probe and HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 clinical sample sequences, respectively. The experiment showed the conservation of a wide linearity that ranged between 1 and 106 copies of input together with a high detection level by the HPIV-1+3 combination for both HPIV types. HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 were both detected at a level of approximately one copy of cloned amplified product (Fig. 1). In addition, the sensitivity of the HPIV-1+3 combination was tested against the serial dilutions of HPIV-1 (ATCC VR-94) and HPIV-3 (ATCC VR-93) cultured and titrated stock. The lowest limits of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 detections were of 0.01 and 0.1 of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), respectively.",

            "text": "When developing a new real-time RT-PCR assay, it is important to investigate its ability to detect clinical samples. Therefore, 20 HPIV-3 and 13 HPIV-1 clinical samples detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids or nasopharyngeal specimens between 1996 and 2007 using previously published methods (Garbino et al., 2006, Regamey et al., 2008) were reanalysed in parallel experiments. The threshold (C\nT) values obtained with HPIV-1+3 were compared to those obtained by using two different specific combinations for HPIV-1 or HPIV-3 which were largely inspired from Corne et al. (1999) and Karron et al. (1994), respectively. All HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 clinical samples were detected by both methods. In concordance with results obtained in the analytical 10-fold dilution series experiment, the HPIV-1+3 exhibits a sensitivity similar to the specific HPIV-1 combination, whereas it is strongly increased (approximately 5 \nC\nT on average) compared to the specific HPIV-3 set of primers\u2013probe (mean of C\nT values comparison between specific HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 primers\u2013probe versus HPIV-1+3 combination: 38.45 \u00b1 5.67 versus 37.33 \u00b1 4.44 for HPIV-1 clinical samples and 33.22 \u00b1 6.01 versus 28.44 \u00b1 5.59 for HPIV-3 clinical samples). Since the stop/restart mechanism at each gene junction is not optimal, sequential HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 transcription leads to a higher transcription of the most proximal genes of the 3\u2032-end of the genome with a further transcription decrease of the more proximal genes of the genome 5\u2032-end. Thus, it can be expected that the HPIV-1+3 combination (designed in L) would be less sensitive than both HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 specific combinations (both designed in HN). However, as mentioned above, these two specific sets of primers\u2013probes were not optimal for real-time PCR assays as they resulted from slot-blot and RT-PCR\u2013enzyme immunoassay (RT-PCR\u2013EIA)-adapted methods, respectively. By using HPIV-1+3, the detection of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genomes are not only simplified, but also improved (at least for HPIV-3) as evidenced across temporally diverse clinical isolates.",

The resulting HPIV-1+3 combination can detect efficiently circulating HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 and, at least for HPIV-3, with a higher sensitivity than the former specific real-time RT-PCR assay.
