This study enrolled a total of 140 ICU nurses who were selected by Jiangsu 39 Province Hospital to work in Wuhan (the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in China) on 40 3 rd February 2020. A questionnaire \"Somatic Symptom Disorders for ICU Nurses in Wuhan 41 No.1 Hospital\" was designed based on the \"International Classification of Functioning, 42 Disability and Health\" (ICF).

In exploratory factor 46 analysis, the symptoms were classified into three clusters: Cluster A of breathing and sleep 47 disturbances (dizziness, sleepiness, dyspnea); Cluster B of gastrointestinal complaints and 48 pain (nausea, headache), and Cluster C of general symptoms (xerostomia, fatigue, 49 chest-discomfort-and-palpitation). In Cluster A, urine/feces splash, sex, and sputum splash 50 were independent predictive factors. In Cluster B, fall of protective glasses and urine/feces 51 splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster C, urine/feces splash and urine/feces 52 clearance were independent predictive factors. 53 Conclusion. The ICU nurses in Wuhan showed varying and overlapping SSDs. These 54 SSDs could be classified into three symptom clusters. Based on the characteristics of their 55 SSDs, specific interventions could be implemented to safeguard the health of ICU nurses.",

A 63 large proportion of COVID-19 patients will progress to a critical condition which needs 64 intensive care. However, given the challenges in treating this disease, ICU nurses are highly 65 prone to somatic symptom disorder (SSD) which is associated with the interaction of biology, 66 cognition, emotion, behavior and environment 1 . The ICU nurses must manage a heavy 67 workload requiring frequent invasive procedures and high attention levels. Therefore, safeguarding the physical and psychological health of ICU nurses can provide a major 69 contribution to the success of epidemic control 2,3 . A symptom cluster is a stable group of two 70 or more co-existing symptoms. The symptom clusters in one population may show overlaps 71 and interactions, a phenomenon that should be resolved to improve the efficiency of 72 managing the disorder 4,5 . Currently, no study has investigated SSDs in ICU nurses fighting at 73 the frontline against the COVID-19 epidemic. Previous studies have confirmed that an 74 individual's response to SSD is dependent on physical, emotional and social factors 6 The questionnaires were handed out through WeChat, an online APP.

This study aims to analyze SSDs and associated risk factors in 140 ICU nurses who were sent by Jiangsu Province Hospital to No.1 Hospital of Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 140 nurses at COVID-19 pneumonia ICUs were selected through convenience sampling. Inclusion criteria: (1) Employed as a full-time nurse at Jiangsu Province Hospital; Has worked at an ICU for serious/critical COVID-19 pneumonia 83 patients in Wuhan; (4) Presented informed consent. Exclusion criteria: (1) No experience in an ICU in Wuhan; (2) Lactation. A questionnaire \"Somatic Symptom Disorders for ICU Nurses in Wuhan No.1 Hospital\" was designed based on \"International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health\"(ICF) 7 . The questions were set out during an expert meeting attended by team leaders, rehabilitation therapists, psychologists, and ICU nurses. Twelve second-level ICF categories were selected from the component of \"Body Function\" in ICF(Table 1). At this step, standardized ICF-linking rules were used 8 . Finally, a list of ICF categories was compiled that was intended to cover 16 symptoms that ICU nurses could reasonably have experienced when treating COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China (Table 1). The frequency and severity of each symptom were scaled (0, no; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe).Another questionnaire was designed to evaluate the possible risk factors. Included in this questionnaire were three datasets: demographic data (sex, age, educational background, marriage, etc.), career data (working years, working years in a particular department, previous in-hospital rotation, title, position, technical level, etc.), and data about ICU work in Wuhan (frequency and time in ICU, extra work, exposure to contaminants and treatment,",

Nursing of critical patients included condition monitoring, sequential oxygen care, sequential treatment nursing, infection prevention, nutrition support, and psychological nursing 19 . In our study, 55.56% of patients were in critical condition. Our results showed that supervisor nurses had more exposures to infectious material and a heavier workload (4.28\u00b17.49 invasive operations and 0.33\u00b10.58 exposures per person).We identified urine/feces splash as an independent risk factor associated with the occurrence of all symptom clusters, which can be explained by three reasons. Firstly, patients' excreta may create aerosols that can allow airborne transmission to those closely involved in the procedure 12 . Secondly, the fecal-oral route of transmission is possible 20 . Thirdly, the proportion of patients needing urine/feces clearance (116, 19.37%) was high, second only to that of closed sputum aspiration (137, 22.87%). Our finding suggested that it is important to develop standard procedures to prevent ICU nurses from urine/feces splash.We found that female was a significant factor associated with occurrence of the symptom cluster of breathing and sleep disturbances. Several previous studies showed that female nurses have a higher risk of daytime sleepiness than male nurses 21, 22 . To mitigate this risk, care should be given to female ICU nurses if they suffer from daytime sleepiness.Finally, our results showed that fall of protective glasses was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of the pain symptom cluster. Blocking transmission is a leading strategy against COVID-19 23 . This finding shows the importance of PPE. A nurse may develop adverse reactions caused by heavy PPE, including nausea and vomiting 24 . We suggest identifying infection control nurses as observers to monitor staff compliance with infection control guidance, give clarification and advice where appropriate and record significant issues relating to infection control procedures 25 .",
