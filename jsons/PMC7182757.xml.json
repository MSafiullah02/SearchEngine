The SCM allows us to find some causal evidence for the effects of restructuring on ratings, but comes at the cost of (i) reducing the number of countries in the sample, (ii) not allowing us to take into account the magnitude of the credit event.2\nOn the contrary, using the panel data analysis, we can take the severity of the default episode into account, and enlarge the sample by considering countries defaulting with both types of creditors.

For the reasons described in the Online Appendix B, we were eventually able to evaluate the effect on six private defaulters and seven official defaulters. For each defaulter, the pool of potential control units encompasses no-defaulters for which data are available. We consider the first year of the debt crisis as the starting point of the treatment period. This timing assumption enables us to observe what would have happened in the absence of the default, both during the debt crisis and in its aftermath.",

Thus, if the path of the outcome variable of the treated and the synthetic unit are alike over a sufficiently long pre-treatment period, the difference (gap) between the Investor\u2019s rating of a defaulting country and the synthetic in the aftermath is an unbiased estimation of the effect of the default.",
