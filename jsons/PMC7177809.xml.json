The number of patients with ESRD has been increasing steadily in incidence and prevalence over recent years. Globally, the number of patients with ESRD was estimated to be 3,200,000 at the end of 2013 with around 6% growth rate, and approximately 2,522,000 patients underwent RRT (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) [2]. The number of patients with ESRD undergoing RRT in Saudi Arabia was estimated to be 3357 at the end of 1993, which increased to 16,897 (513 cases per million population) at the end of 2015, with 15,590 patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment and 1307 undergoing peritoneal dialysis [3].",

In addition, patients with CKD usually have numerous comorbidities, and many are prescribed medications [8]. Highly prescribed-medications lead to impaired adherence to drug therapy [8]. It is known that patient counseling and providing instructions help in promoting the proper utilization of drugs, which may lead to effective therapeutic results and medication adherence [4]. Medication counseling can be defined as providing medication information orally or in a written procedure to the patients or their representatives on instructions of use, information on side effects, precautions, storage, diet, and lifestyle modifications [5]. Primary studies revealed that through medication counseling, pharmacists might recognize and solve drug-related problems, improve patient\u2019s knowledge about the appropriate use of drugs, increase patient satisfaction with the pharmacist\u2019s service, and consequently optimize patient quality of care [4]. Another study conducted in 2014 showed that education and counseling by clinical pharmacists in patients undergoing hemodialysis led to a clinically and statistically significant improvement in the quality of life of those patients [9].",

As a result, it will help to identify patients requiring improvements in the service provided [10].

According to the Joint International Pharmaceutical Federation and World Health Organization guidelines, good pharmacy practice is defined as the practice that responds to the needs of people who use the pharmacists\u2019 services to provide optimal and evidence-based care [12]. The most common mistakes by pharmacists that affect the quality of counseling and patient safety include providing incorrect instructions to patients about their prescribed medication(s), duration of the counseling, and the communication skills of the pharmacist [13]. There are a couple of strategies suggested to improve the counseling service including providing written medication instruction to the patients [14], and pharmacist-managed clinics for education and counseling of patients undergoing dialysis [15].

This study is similar to ours in terms of the targeted population, as well as the assessment of pharmacist counseling, and patient satisfaction regarding the service provided but differs regarding objectives (i.e., to measure patient knowledge, attitude, and practice outcomes). The researchers concluded that pharmacist-provided counseling is effective in improving the knowledge, attitude, and practice of patients toward disease management [16]. In contrast, we found additional related studies in terms of targeted population and the assessment of the satisfaction of patients undergoing hemodialysis but with other objectives. For example, a survey study was undertaken by the American Association of Kidney Patients on 977 patients with ESRD found that patients were moderately satisfied with their pre-treatment education [17]. Another cross-sectional survey concluded that patients undergoing hemodialysis are least satisfied with the complex aspects of care [9].",

The results of this study reveal that most patients undergoing hemodialysis (77.5%) were satisfied with the pharmacist services. In addition, about 74% of patients undergoing hemodialysis gave an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating to pharmacy medication counseling services. We compared our findings with those of a study conducted in central Saudi Arabia to assess the influence of counseling on patients undergoing hemodialysis and their quality of life. It found that most patients undergoing hemodialysis were satisfied with healthcare provider services (88.7%), and 88% of patients undergoing hemodialysis received counseling from their healthcare providers (physicians, pharmacists, and nurses) on medication use [22]. This could be related to the counseling of different healthcare providers.
