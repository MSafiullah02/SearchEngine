Bat viruses comprised clades I, IV and V, while primate and rodent viruses formed the clades II and III, respectively. All the bat viruses newly identified here fell into clade V. This clade, comprising only hepadnaviruses from the Old World, was further divided into two phylogenetic groups. The first group could be further separated into six lineages (denoted A-F), highlighting the extensive diversity of bat hepadnaviruses. The viruses in these lineages, which were identified in M. schreibersii and M. davidii bats sampled from Anlong (Guizhou province) and M. schreibersii, R. pearsonii, and R. pusillus from Neixiang (Henan province), formed a distinct lineage (denoted A) and possessed 99.4-100% nucleotide identity. Both lineages C and E were sampled in Longquan in Zhejiang province, and found in R. sinicus and H. armiger bats, respectively. Strikingly, lineage F comprised viruses identified in eight bat species from three families (Miniopteridae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae) at all investigating sites, with 95.5-100% nucleotide identity. In addition, this group contained two other lineages (B and D) comprising viruses previously sampled from roundleaf bats (H. pomona) and horseshoe bats (R. affinis and R. sinicus) in Yunnan province, China Wang et al., 2017a) . The nucleotide differences between the six lineages ranged from 77.4% to 92.8%. Remarkably, within the second group, the bat viruses identified in R. ferrumequinum from Jiyuan in Henan province formed a sister group to viruses identified in horseshoe (R. alcyone) and roundleaf (H. cf. ruber) bats sampled from Gabon in West Africa (Drexler et al., 2013) . The newly identified viruses exhibited 20.3-20.5% nucleotide difference from the Gabonese viruses (Table 2) . Clade V showed a sister relationship to clade IV, with the latter comprising only LBHBVs identified in M. fuliginosus sampled from Myanmar (He et al., 2013) .

Comparison of amino sequences revealed that the newly identified bat viruses had high identity within a short amino acid motif (NPLGFFPDH) that is conserved among primate viruses (Fig. 5 ). In particular, virus Lushi-Rpu-157 shared the same amino acid residues as the primate hepadnaviruses, and exhibited high levels of sequence identity to primate viruses within adjacent accessory domains (motifs NPDWD and NKDHWPEANKVGVG). As the lineage including Lushi-Rpu-157 have a broad range of bat hosts and geographic distribution, further studies are needed to evaluate their infectivity in human hepatocytes.

The tree topologies of viruses and their hosts exhibited a strong co-divergence at the level of host order. However, there was a clear incongruence between bat hepadnaviruses and their bat hosts at the family, genus, species levels, especially for the newly identified viruses of lineage F. A similar incongruence between primate viruses and rodent viruses and their respective hosts was also evident. Combined, our co-phylogenetic analysis of orthohepadnaviruses and their hosts provided evidence for 10-12 co-divergence events, 23-25 host switches, 0 lineage duplications, 0-2 losses and 0 failure to diverge events (Fig. 6B) . Overall, therefore, our co-phylogenetic analysis did not identify significant congruence between the phylogenetic trees of orthohepadnaviruses and their mammalian hosts (P < 0.05), although the presence of hepadnaviruses in diverse vertebrates makes it likely that these virushost associations have been established for millions of years. A relatively high frequency of cross-species transmission on a background of co-divergence was also apparent in virus-host tanglegrams (Fig. S1 ). We also examined the frequency of cross-species transmission by examining the distribution of bat viruses in China. We identified hepadnaviruses from 10 species of bats sampled in five locations in three Chinese provinces (Fig. 1) . Notably, within the first group of clade V the same virus was identified in several bat species from the same geographic locality. For example, lineage A was present in four bats species from three families sampled in both Guizhou and Henan provinces (Table S1) . Similarly, lineage F of group 2 was identified in 11 bat species from three families. Notably, although Anlong (Guizhou province) is > 1102 km distant from Jiyuan, Lushi and Neixiang in Henan province in central China, and from Longquan (Zhejiang province) located in the eastern costal region (> 1420 km distant), the newly identified lineage F was found in all these regions, suggesting that these viruses face relatively limited host and geographic barriers. More notable was that the viruses identified in R. ferrumequinum bats sampled from Jiyuan city (Henan province) within group 2 were more closely related to the viruses sampled from Gabon in West Africa than to Chinese bat viruses, including others from Jiyuan.

Our co-phylogenetic analysis of hepadnaviruses and their hosts revealed that the cross-species transmission of orthohepadnaviruses has occurred relatively frequently in the evolutionary history of these viruses (Fig. 6 ).

This is further supported by the observation that the viruses harbored by R. ferrumequinumbats from Jiyuan in Henan province were most closely related to those identified in the R. alcyone and H. cf. ruber bats sampled from Gabon in West Africa (Drexler et al., 2013) (Figs. 2 and 3) . The Rhinolophidae are estimated to have diverged from the ancestor of the Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae approximately 42 million years ago during the Eocene (Foley et al., 2015) . Although an African origin of the Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae was recently proposed (Foley et al., 2015) , more researchers have argued for an Asian origin (Bogdanowicz and Owen, 1992; Teeling et al., 2005; Stoffberg et al., 2010; Ravel et al., 2014) . In addition, the ancestor of the superfamily Noctilionoidea, to which U. bilobatum bats belong, is also likely to have originated in the Old World (Teeling et al., 2005) . Thus, although the most divergent bat hepadnaviruses -the TBHBV clade -have to date only been sampled in the New World, it is possible that they are also present in the Old World.
