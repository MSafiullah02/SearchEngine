The regression analysis showed CRP was significantly associated with the aggravation of non-severe COVID-19 patients, with an area under the curves (AUC) of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.761 -0.926) and the optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/L.

Therefore, how to identify this group of patients early and give active monitoring and treatment early is critical to reduce mortality and improve outcomes of COVID-19 patients.

As reported in a recent article [12] , severe COVID-19 patients were older and were more likely to have underlying disease, which is consistent with our study. Non-severe patients progressed to severe cases seemed older and with a higher probability of having underlying diseases. In terms of the symptoms, patients progressed from non-severe to severe were more likely to have shortness of breath. Several published articles also reported a higher rate of shortness of breath in severe COVID-19 patients [5, 12] . Although these exacerbated patients felt dyspnea at an early stage, the blood oxygen saturation did not reach the standard of severe cases, which may be explained by the compensatory effect of faster breathing.",
