This has hampered progress in its diagnosis and effective management. One of the main symptoms of SARS is fever. Fever is also common in other viral infections including dengue which is very common in Asia where the possibility of another SARS outbreak exists. Due to the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus, every febrile patient suspected of SARS screened at the screening centre need to be isolated. This led to a high demand for isolation beds, which is a limited resource in most acute care hospitals, during the SARS outbreak. Furthermore, the more specific serological test only becomes positive late in the course of the disease (Peiris et al., 2003b) , whilst RT-PCR for the coronavirus RNA have a detection rate of 79 and 80% in nasopharyngeal aspirate and plasma respectively during the first 3 days of illness (Grant et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2003) .
