And the public are also eager to receive the latest information about COVID-19 from the media. However, it is suggested that repeated media exposure to public health crises, including infectious diseases, can cause heightened psychological distress (Garfin et al., 2020). We still don\u2019t know whether high levels of COVID-19 media exposure can result in amplified anxiety and depression in the general population as well (Holmes et al., 2020). So, in the current study, we examined the association between media exposure to information about COVID-19 and psychological distress in the general population in China.",

Media exposure to information about COVID-19 was assessed by asking respondents how many hours per day (\u22641, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \u22657) they spent receiving information about COVID-19 from different media sources (e.g., television, radio, newspaper, online websites, and social media) in the past one week. Psychological distress was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Besides, we collected respondents\u2019 information on demographics, history of mental illness, and social support (based on the Oslo Social Support Scale [OSSS-3]) (Kocalevent et al., 2018), as well as other COVID-19 exposure covariates by asking respondents whether they were diagnosed with COVID-19; whether they had a history of contact with COVID-19 cases; whether someone close to them was diagnosed with COVID-19; and whether they or someone close to them was working on the front lines of COVID-19 (Table 1\n). Multivariate linear regression was used to explain the association between media exposure to information about COVID-19 and psychological distress in the general population after adjustment for covariates.",

The negative effects of repeated media exposure on mental health can be seen in other community crises, including the 9/11 terrorist attack, the Boston Marathon Bombings, and the 2014 Ebola epidemic (Garfin et al., 2020). Media-fueled psychological distress can engender misplaced help-seeking behaviors that will consume large amounts of health care resources. Our study suggests that it may be true of the COVID-19 epidemic as well and necessitates future actions to buffer the negative effects of repeated media exposure to information about COVID-19.",
