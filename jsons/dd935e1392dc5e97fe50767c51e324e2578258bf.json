The clinical diagnosis of KD can be somewhat subjective, because clinical features can be transient and vary in intensity with some children lacking complete features (incomplete KD) [2] . Kawasaki disease requires multidisciplinary care, and those who may diagnose KD (ie, hospitalist, rheumatology, or infectious diseases [ID] specialist) and cardiologists involved in the management of patients. Care may sometimes be fragmented with multiple providers and transfers of care at different stages of illness and/or follow up, particularly for those patients with refractory and recurrent disease. This may lead to lack of communication of pertinent history. To address this need for continuity of care, in 2012, we created a multidisciplinary team for the care of all KD patients at our hospital, which comprised ID and cardiology clinicians with rheumatology care as needed. The attending ID physicians, who are typically the clinicians who first evaluate KD patients in our hospital, provided standardized clinical and laboratory data documentation of criteria for diagnosis on the day of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

We added a rating scale to the overall confidence in the KD diagnosis, which allowed us to gauge the overall clinical impression on the day of treatment for KD. There are potential benefits to standardizing documentation of the clinical presentation of KD on the day of treatment. First, the standardization of data collection allows for reassessment of the diagnostic certainty before proceeding with subsequent treatments for those who fail to respond to initial IVIG. This is important before considering additional doses of IVIG, because adverse effects can be dose dependent, such as hemolytic anemia [5] [6] [7] . Second, more precise associations of clinical outcomes with the type of KD, especially incomplete KD, can be made using this approach. Utilization of the AHA algorithm for incomplete KD has been shown to improve the diagnosis of KD in children who developed CAA [8] , but the accuracy of the diagnosis for those with incomplete KD who do not meet these criteria is less clear. Among children with incomplete KD who did not meet the AHA criteria and whose initial echocardiograms were normal in this cohort, the IVIG resistance rate remained relatively high at 11%, but none developed CAA, and they had a trend towards lower rate of periungual peeling than other groups. Finally, utilization of this approach can allow for more precise epidemiologic data for the incidence and characteristics of IVIG resistance. Intravenous immunoglobulin resistance rates may vary [9] , but these rates may be related to a lower likelihood of an accurate diagnosis of KD initially in some patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 832, "end": 835, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 836, "end": 839, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1107, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1710, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Patients treated for incomplete KD without baseline coronary abnormalities and who did not meet the AHA-defined criteria were more likely to have a subsequent autoimmune/ autoinflammatory diagnosis. We have previously reported the clinical presentation of systemic onset juvenile arthritis after the KD diagnosis and noted on literature review of prior reported cases that most were diagnosed as incomplete KD specifically lacking scleral injection [4] . Mevalonate kinase deficiency and PFAPA diagnoses causing recurrent fevers have been previously described after initial treatment for incomplete KD [10, 11] . Whether children who were subsequently diagnosed with an autoimmune/autoinflammatory illness actually had KD initially or had an alternative diagnosis is unclear. It has been suggested that recurrent fever disorders and KD may share the same propensity for activation of innate immune responses causing elevations in cytokine profiles and that the diseases may be related in those predisposed [11] . In either case, clinicians should observe these children for development of other symptoms. Longer-term cardiology follow-up visits for KD patients may represent an ideal time to screen for autoimmune/autoinflammatory symptoms and referral when appropriate. The generally accepted practice in our institution is to order viral testing for patients being evaluated for KD. We recognize that among patients diagnosed with KD, respiratory viral detection is fairly common [12] and should not impact the decision to treat for KD, particularly for those with complete KD. However, viral characterization of adenovirus in children may be useful in distinguishing the 2 illnesses when coupled with the clinical presentation, especially for those being evaluated for incomplete KD [13, 14] . In addition, viral testing is often obtained before an inpatient attending evaluation. We urge clinicians to use caution in interpretation of viral detection from the respiratory tract of patients being evaluated for KD; findings should be interpreted only in conjunction with the clinical and laboratory evaluation of KD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 607, "end": 610, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1486, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1790, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1794, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our findings are consistent with other recent US cohorts in that the majority of CAA in affected KD patients are present during the initial hospitalization, with prior reports ranging from 81% to 84% [15, 16] .
