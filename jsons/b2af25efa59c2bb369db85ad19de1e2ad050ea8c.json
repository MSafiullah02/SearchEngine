T h i s idea was not developed in that report but I have since been fortunate in interesting Ilr. A. J.

'The whole conception that speciation is taking place presents the problem that many of thc forms under discussion have a status somewhere between that of a subspecies and that of a species, and there is no method in trinomial nomenclature for indicating this. I have therefore avoided trinomials where possible when the discussion indicates doubt on the status of a particular form. Also, while I helieve many of the forms now considered as subspecies are at least close to achieving specific rank, I am rcluctant to recommend that they should be treated as species, with the consequent nomenclatorial changes, until they have been further studied in the field.

Hence a narrow belt on and below the escarpment combines the high summer rainfall of the inland districts with the high all-yearround humidity cd the coastal plains (see Figs. 1 and 2): in consequence it supports a richer and more varied vegetation. The southern tip of this belt is found at the base of the escarpment at Capangombe and Vila Arriaga, where there are fertile pockets between the semi-desert thornveld and the escarpment face. There may be other pockets even further south but there is no continuous belt for, at Cahinde, 40 miles south of Capangombe, the thornveld comes right to the foot of the escarpment. Above the escarpment in the south the brachystegia woodlands and the acacia of the plateau merge gradually into the richer vegetation belt at about Quilengues. 1'0 a traveller coming from the monotony of the brachystegia woodlands or the semi-desert the change is indicated by the increase in cultivation, new species of trees and bushes, among which are palms and baobabs, and areas of tangled thickets.

These forests are impoverished outliers of the true lowland forest of the Congo and are not comparable to it either in the size of the trees or in the density and the undergrowth. For this reason I have distinguished them under the term \" escarpment forests \": I do not include with them some small patches on the Chela escarpment which have been found to be relict montane forest. I I have no personal knowledge of the country north of the Cuanza, and it is not easy to form a picture of it from maps and literature. It is evident that the escarpment is not such a dominant feature as in the south, there being a rise of only 1000 ft. between Vila Salazar and Malanje, which lies at about 3400 ft. on the central plateau. Apart from the forest patches, the vegetation of the wide coastal plain would seem to be similar to that found along the base of the escarpment further south, though getting progressively richer northwards, and rather richer in the centre of the plain, with more grassland on the coast. Inland it changes in the vicinity of Duque de Braganqa to savannah grassland and brachystegia woodland. In western Angola there is thus a wedge of richer vegetation lying between the drier areas of thornveld or grassland and brachystegia woodland. In the north it is wide with considerable patches of forest; in the south it tapers to a very narrow belt along the escarpment with forest patches rarer and less extensive. This wedge is indicated on the Vegetation Map of Africa south of the Tropic of Cancer (Oxford University Press 1958) by the area described under \" Woodlands, savannas \" as \" undifferentiated:relatively moist types \", in which \" Isoberlinia, Brachystegia and Julbernardia are absent or rare \".

The relationship of the Grey Tits P. afer and P. griseiventris was discussed in previous papers (Hall & Traylor 1959 , Stuart Irwin 1959 in which it was shown that P. griskutntris of the brachystegia woodlands should be treated as a separate species from P. ufer of the acacia country and scrub since two forms behaved as good species in part of Southern Rhodesia, being sympatric but ecologically segregated, and showing no hybridization. P. griseiventris ranges east and south of the Congo forest from Lake Tanganyika to Mt. Moco, Caconda and Huila in western Angola and south to Rusape in Southern Rhodesia. Forms of P. afer range southward and eastward from the semi-desert behind Btmguela through South West Africa and Bechuanaland to the Rusape area. Other isolated forms of P. afer are found in the acacia country of northeastern Kenya, southern Abyssinia and Somaliland. The ranges of P. afer and P. griseiventris overlap only in Southern Rhodesia; in Angola they are separated in the west by the Escarpment Zone and probably in the south by the acacia-mopane belt in which, in northern Bechuanaland and South West Africa, the Grey Tit is replaced by the Black Tit.",

The picture presented by the Familiar Chats in the Brachystegia and Acacia Zones is in some ways analogous to that presented by the Blue Flycatchers E. fongicauda and E. albicauda in the Escarpment and Brachystegia Zones. I n each case there are two well-marked groups, one in the north and one in the south, each with a representative in different zones in Angola. In the chats there is a northern group in West, East and Central Africa ranging south to the Zambezi valley on the east and to Mt. Moco and Huila on the west. In this group thc underparts are predominantly washed with grey and there is very little constant geographical variation, though many names have been proposed. Birds from the Zambezi valley can be matched with those of West Africa and Angola and all can be calledfalkensteini, the grcycr ornoensis of Abyssinia being closcly allied. In Angola fulketzsteini has been collected on Mt. hIoco and at Huila (Heinrich 1958 : 357, \" C. f. artgolensis \"). I n the southern group the undcrparts are washed with butf varying from a very pale wash in angolensis of the Acacia Zone to the rich buff races funriliaris and hellnzuyri of Cape Province, the Transvaal and Southern Rhodesia. T h e palc angolensis has heen collected at Luanda, in the Benguela area, and at Cahindc. It intergrades through the South West African races hoeschi, p l t o n i and richardi with hellnrayri, which in Southern Rhodesia is found in all the country away from the Zarnbezi and its tributaries (Smithers et ul. 1957 : 1OY) . T h e limited material from Angola shows no intergradation between thc grey and buffish groups though their ranges come very close, but Stuart Irwin informs me that thcre is one specimen in the Sational AIuseum of Southern Rhodesia from Gadzema, Hartley district, S. Rhodesia, which is intermediate betweenfalkerrsteini and hellmapi. (This specimen is shown on the map with a combined dot and cross.) 'I'he relationship betwcen the two groups may thereforc be different in the east and in the west. T h i s is also suggested by the fact that in the west the ranges of the two groups coincide with the range of brachystegia and thorn country-although the Familiar Chat is a typical bird of rocky hills rather than of woodland or bush. In the east there seems no such coincidence.",

This is suggested strongly by both the Familiar Chat and the Fiscal Shrike, in both of which the form of the Brachystegia Zone is the same as, or close to, the West African form. The green-backed Eremomel0 salvudorii is another form that probably developed in isolation north of Angola, but the grey-backedpolioxaniha may have been primarily an acacia form that has proved adaptable and has not been e.ntirely driven out by the re-invasion.",

With its combination of green head, bright yellow throat and grey underparts it seems to have no close affinities with any other species.",

They thus seem to be relicts, comparable in some ways to the relict montane species on the mountains fringing the Congo basin, and amongst them are several which seem to be nearing extinction. Many of them do not seem to be primarily associated with the escarpment forests: Colius castanotus, Cisticola bulliens, Ratis minulla and Prionops gabela are none of them exclusively forest species. It is also possible that those, like the greenbuls Clzlorocichla falkensieini and Phyllastrephus fulvzvetztris, that now appear to be forest species, may have only recently adapted themselves to forest conditions since it is otherwise difficult to account for their limited distribution in the Belgian Congo.",

He has been kind enough to allow me to quote freely from the manuscript, awaiting publication, of an \" Essay on the Flora of Southern Tropical Africa \". In this he speaks of the recurrent alternation of pluvial and dry periods in Africa during which the forests have swollen and shrunk in area and reciprocally the savannahs and grasslands have retreated and advanced. In the interpluvial periods the Kalahari desert was prompt to advance and Kalahari sand has occupied a vast wedge of territory extending through eastern and northeastern Angola right up to the Belgian Congo and almost to the Equator. Similarly the deciduous woodlands have advanced and retreated. This is all compatible with the suggestion that at one time the woodlands retreated from the plateau above the escarpment, while the Escarpment Zone provided an island in which birds not tolerant of dry Conditions have survived in isolation from others of their kind, which have retreated e astwards and northeastwards with the woodlands.",

It is tempting to try and associate the old avifauna of the Escarpment Zone, which has its nearest relatives widely distributed, with this period of history.

Group 3 shows that there are an unusual number of endemic species in the Escarpment Zone. All this indicates that western Angola is an area of considerable importance in evolution but any explanation of how this situation has developed must necessarily be very speculative. T h e most tenable one seems to lie in the conception of the Escarpment Zone as an area less affected by climatic changes than surrounding areas, and one in which birds have been able to develop in isolation during successive wet and dry periods.

With the return of wetter conditions the acacia and the acacia forms retreated south, leaving occasional islands behind as a t Vouga, and the returning woodlands were re-populated largely from the north and northeast. In the period of isolation the forms in different zones developed independently and, on coming together again, in many cases behaved as good species in relation to each other. In other cases speciation was not so advanced and two forms have interbred. I t must be emphasized that much remains to be learnt of the relationships between most of these forms; more extensive collecting is likely to show that some of the conclusions are wrong regarding the individual status of forms, but this does not alter the conclusion that these forms represent stages in the development of species.",

T. v . plumbeiceps ranges southwards ' :o South West Africa and eastwards through the Rhodesias, intergrading with violacea caf Nyasaland and forming with violacea a group of T. viridis distinguished by lack of white in the wings and greyer and duller heads than other forms. In the non-breeding season (April to July) plumbeiceps wanders widely and has been found in the northern Congo and Cameroons; many of the records from the Escarpment Zone and the one from Quela are from the non-breeding season, and there is no certainty that it breeds alongside T. melampyra, though there is one record from Dondo in November. It has, however, been collected at both Malanje and Mt. Moco in the breeding season so that the breeding ranges of T. v . plumbeiceps and T. m. bannermani are certainly very close.
