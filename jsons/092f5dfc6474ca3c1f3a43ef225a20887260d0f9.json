            "text": "There is limited information about newborns with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Particularly in the hospital after delivery, clinicians have refined practices in order to prevent secondary infection. While guidance from international associations is continuously being updated, all facets of care of neonates born to women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are centerspecific, given local customs, building infrastructure constraints, and availability of protective equipment. Based on anecdotal reports from institutions in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic close to our hospital, together with our limited experience, in anticipation of increasing numbers of exposed newborns, we have developed a triage algorithm at the Penn State Hospital at Milton S. Hershey Medical Center that may be useful for other centers anticipating a similar surge. We discuss several care practices that have changed in the COVID-19 era including the use of antenatal steroids, delayed cord clamping (DCC), mother-newborn separation, and breastfeeding. Moreover, this paper provides comprehensive guidance on the most suitable respiratory support for newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also present detailed recommendations about the discharge process and beyond, including providing scales and home phototherapy to families, parental teaching via telehealth and in-person education at the doors of the hospital, and telehealth newborn follow-up.",

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory disease of varying severity [4] , which presents more commonly as asymptomatic or mild disease in newborns when compared with adults [5] [6] [7] . SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, infected fomites [8] [9] [10] , and from airborne transmission during aerosolization procedures [11] . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published initial guidance on the management of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 [12] . Another group recently published a practical resource for perinatalneonatal specialists, providing the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 during pregnancy [13] . Since the epidemiological data for this pandemic are rapidly evolving, neonatologists need to continuously update management",

The physiological mechanisms underlying these differences are as yet unknown, but several possibilities exist that should be explored in future studies. The immature developing immune system of children may respond to SARS-CoV-2 differently than adults, possibly resulting in a less damaging cytokine reaction. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-II (ACE-2) receptors on type II alveolar epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract to gain entry into the lungs [35, 36] , and ACE-2 receptors may be functionally immature in children making them less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [37] .",

Moreover, transport of the newborn, considered a person under investigation (PUI) [42] , out of the SAICU was also delayed by the institution's COVID-19 transport policy.

For newborns, the AAP recommends obtaining throat and nasopharynx swabs at about 24 and 48 h after birth, although the optimal time of testing is unknown [12] . The testing regimen should also take into account the risk of infection and limitations of resources. Additional testing in symptomatic neonates should be considered because early test results may be negative due to the incubation period of the virus. A respiratory viral panel, to rule out other infections, should also be considered in symptomatic neonates [15] .",

Neonates are weighed on the home scale during the encounter, allowing the pediatrician to visualize the neonate's tone, color, demeanor, and respiratory status. If the pediatrician is concerned about jaundice, or if the infant was discharged with home phototherapy, arrangements are made for a laboratory technician in full PPE to obtain a serum bilirubin sample in the home.

Although vertical transmission is unlikely, monitoring of neonates born to mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is imperative. While many facets of care remain the same, other practices such as antenatal corticosteroids, DCC, separation and visitation, breastfeeding, airway management and respiratory support, and neonatal follow-up have been impacted by COVID-19. While we hope our policies and procedures may be helpful to other institutions, each center must develop and revise their guidelines to provide optimal care for patients while conserving vital PPE and ventilators and protecting healthcare workers. Given the low rate of disease in newborns to date, our policies may change in the near future to allow cohabitation, direct breastfeeding, and routine newborn care for newborn PUIs without signs of disease.",
