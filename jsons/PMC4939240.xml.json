CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) account for approximately 60%-65% and 33% of all CRS cases, respectively.1 This chronic disease results in reduced quality of life by causing poor sleep, fatigue, and bodily pain.6 CRS is associated with significant health care costs and based on a systematic review can lead to an annual expenditure of 2014 US dollar equivalent of $9.9 billion in direct costs and $13.1 billion in indirect costs.6, 7, 8 A survey-based study identified that over a 5-year period, close to 48 million outpatient visits in the United States were for CRS and antibiotics were prescribed 69% of the time.9 We suspect that a great majority of these clinic visits were because of infectious CRS exacerbations, suggesting significant utilization of health care resources. Difficult-to-treat CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) may be associated with humoral immunodeficiency5 as discussed later. A small percentage of patients with refractory sinusitis have genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) that increase the risk to develop this disease.10\n",

Asthma and CRS often coexist; asthma exacerbations are associated with CRS exacerbations and treatment of CRS results in improved asthma control.13, 14 A large percentage of patients with bronchiectasis have CRS, and the presence of CRS is associated with more severe bronchiectasis.15 Disorders of the mucociliary transport system may contribute to the development of CRS as well. CF is caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene,16 and specific mutations in DNAH5 and DNAH11 are found in patients with PCD.

Polymicrobial bacterial species have been identified in healthy and diseased sinus mucosa by conventional culture and molecular techniques.21, 22, 23 It is proposed that colonizing bacteria can contribute to the pathogenesis of CRS via formation of biofilms. Biofilms are composed of layers of live bacteria within a matrix of protein and nucleic acid. These bacterial plaques on mucosal surfaces allow infectious pathogens to develop antimicrobial resistance and evade host defenses24 because these bacteria are metabolically inactive, potentially leading to infectious CRS exacerbations. Studies suggest that bacterial biofilms are a cause of recalcitrant CRS.25 Alteration in the sinonasal microbiome may also contribute to the pathogenesis of CRS. Patients with CRS have microbiome dysbiosis,26 which is characterized by reduced bacterial diversity and an increase in relative abundance of specific bacterial species compared with healthy individuals.27 This altered microbial flora contributes to the phenotypic differences between patients with CRS and those without CRS.",

Small peptides such as defensins and cathelicidins and large enzymatic proteins such as lysozyme and lactoferrin kill bacteria.28 Abnormalities in the epithelial cell barrier function result in an impaired immune system and allow colonization by infectious pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. The S100 family of proteins produced by epithelial cells plays an important role in cell differentiation, barrier function, and antimicrobial activity. Studies in patients with CRS have shown reduced levels of S100 proteins, psoriasin, and calprotectin, which may potentially increase susceptibility to infections.28, 29 Another family of epithelium-secreted proteins called PLUNC (palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone), which is involved in innate immunity, was profoundly reduced in polyp tissue of patients with CRSwNP.30, 31 Additional abnormalities in the innate immune system that may contribute to infectious CRS include reduced expression of SPINK5, a gene responsible for expression of epithelial protein, LEKT1, which is decreased in CRS but is important for epithelial barrier function.32 Epithelial cell host defense molecule release is regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),12 and blunting of STAT3 signaling has been demonstrated in CRS and may be responsible for decreased antimicrobial protein release from epithelial cells in nasal polyps.33\n",

Microorganisms that are not detected either via conventional culture or with molecular diagnostics are likely part of the resident microbiome and probably help maintain a healthy sinus mucosa. Additionally, it may be that some nonpathogenic bacteria within the sinus mucosa are indeed responsible in the CRS disease process, but their exact role is unclear. Viral URTIs can contribute to CRS exacerbations too. In one study, coronavirus was identified via molecular sequencing as the most common virus in patients with CRS.39 Although the exact role of viruses in CRS exacerbation is not certain, they likely contribute to the disturbance of the symbiotic microbiome and lead to clinical disease.",

Topical intranasal steroids help decrease sinonasal inflammation and can be extremely effective in managing some patients with CRS.5 Nasal saline irrigation removes mucus and assists in clearing bacterial biofilms.4 The combination of both topical intranasal steroid and nasal saline irrigation may be helpful in CRS, but among these 2 treatment options, topical intranasal steroid is superior as single therapy alone.47 Although treatment with oral antibiotics is usually the first therapeutic option utilized in CRS, strong evidence for using oral antibiotics in CRS is lacking in the literature. There are only 3 placebocontrolled studies evaluating treatment with oral antibiotics in CRS.48, 49, 50 A Cochrane review on systemic antibiotics for CRS, which included only 1 randomized study, showed limited effectiveness of macrolide therapy.51 Since then, one study showed that long-term use of azithromycin for the treatment of CRS did not show benefit compared with placebo.49 Another study evaluating the use of oral antibiotics was in patients with CRSwNP and will be discussed in other sections of this journal.50 Oral antibiotics may be most useful in infectious CRS exacerbations and especially in those patients with purulent drainage. Topical antibiotics may be effective in CRS, but they are more likely to benefit post\u2013sinus surgery patients or those patients who receive culture-directed antibiotics.52 Finally, oral steroids can provide symptomatic relief from nasal congestion and improve sense of smell in patients with CRSwNP.5 Retrospective studies looking at oral antibiotics and steroids together in patients with CRS have demonstrated improvement in symptoms, decrease in radiographic severity of sinus disease,53 and decreased likelihood of sinus surgery.54 Although there are some available therapies for CRS, better, reliable, and more targeted treatment options are necessary.",

To date, the association of CRS and CFTR gene mutations is the most promising finding due to replication of data in various studies.16 The high prevalence of CRS in patients with CF suggests that the CFTR gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of CRS.",

Concomitant immunodeficiency should also be suspected in this subset of patients, and laboratory workup including complete blood count with differential, quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), specific antibody response to polysaccharide antigens (IgG antibody response 4 weeks postvaccination after pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine), complement function, and if necessary, measurement of B- and T-cell numbers by flow cytometry should be performed.5 Patients with high-risk sexual behavior should undergo HIV screening to exclude an acquired immunodeficiency.5 Prophylactic antibiotics or Ig replacement therapy should be considered in patients with recurrent exacerbations of infectious CRS and proven defect in humoral immunity.5 Any patient with CRS with concern for immunodeficiency or with the presence of atypical or opportunistic pathogens in the sinonasal mucosa should be referred for evaluation to a clinic specializing in allergy, sinus disease, and immunodeficiency. If anatomic abnormalities such as deviated nasal septum are believed to be the cause of recurrent infectious CRS exacerbations, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for surgical evaluation.5 Additionally, any patient diagnosed with nasal polyps or CRS at an early age and with P. aeruginosa cultured from the sinonasal cavity should be evaluated for CF.5\n",
