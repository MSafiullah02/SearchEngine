Other pandemics like the 1918 \"Spanish Flu\" may change into devastating event. Reducing the impact of these threats is of paramount importance for health authorities, and studies have shown that effective interventions can be taken to contain the epidemics, if early detection can be made. In this paper, we introduce Social Network Enabled Flu Trends (SNEFT), a continuous data collection framework which monitors flu related messages on online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook and track the emergence and spread of an influenza. We show that text mining significantly enhances the correlation between online social network(OSN) data and the Influenza like Illness (ILI) rates provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For accurate prediction, we implemented an auto-regression with exogenous input (ARX) model which uses current OSN data and CDC ILI rates from previous weeks to predict current influenza statistics. Our results show that, while previous ILI data from the CDC offer a true (but delayed) assessment of a flu epidemic, OSN data provides a real-time assessment of the current epidemic condition and can be used to compensate for the lack of current ILI data. We observe that the OSN data is highly correlated with the ILI rates across different regions within USA and can be used to effectively improve the accuracy of our prediction. Therefore, OSN data can act as supplementary indicator to gauge influenza within a population and helps to discover flu trends ahead of CDC.",

In 1918, the socalled \"Spanish flu\" killed an estimated 20-40 million people worldwide, and since then, human-to-human transmission capable influenza virus has resurfaced in a variety of particularly virulent forms much like \"SARS\" and \"H1N1\" against which no prior immunity exists, resulting in a devastating situation with severe casualties. Reducing the impact of seasonal epidemics and pandemics such as the H1N1 influenza is of paramount importance for public health authorities. Studies have shown that preventive measures can be taken to contain epidemics, if an early detection is made or if we have some form of an early warning system during the germination of an epidemic [7, 14] . Therefore, it is important to be able to track and predict the emergence and spread of flu in the population.",

Since Oct 18, 2009, we have searched and collected tweets and profile details of Twitter users who mentioned flu descriptors in their tweets. Facebook opened their Search functionality in early February 2010 and since then we have been fetching status updates and wall posts of Facebook users with mention of flu descriptors.

In an attempt to investigate such a drastic drop in correlation we looked at data samples and found spurious messages which suppressed the actual data. To list a few, tweets like \"I got flu shot today.\", \"#nowplaying Vado -Slime Flu..i got one recently!\" (Slime flu is the name of a debut mixtape from an artist V.A.D.O. released in 2010) are false alarms. In the year 2009-2010, the Swine Flu event was so evident that the noise did not significantly affect the correlation that existed then. To mitigate this problem, we removed the spurious tweets using a filtering technique that trains a document classifier to label whether a message is indicative of a flu event or not.",

To create such an annotated dataset which demands human intelligence, we use Amazon Mechanical Turks to manually classify a sample of 25,000 tweets and 10,000 status updates. Every message is classified by exactly three Turks and the majority classified result is attached as the final class for that message. The training dataset is fed as an input to different classifiers namely decision tree (J48), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayesian. For efficient learning, some configurations that we incorporated within our text classification algorithm include setting term frequency and inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weighting, stemming, using a stopwords list, limiting the number of words to keep (feature vector set) and reordering class. Based on the results shown in Table 1 , we conclude that SVM classifier with highest precision and recall rate outperforms other classifiers when it comes to text classification for our data set. Application of SVM on unclassified data originating from within the United States resulted in a Twitter dataset with 280K positively classified tweets from 187K unique twitter users and 185K positively classified facebook posts from 164K unique Facebook users. In order to gauge if the number of unique twitter users mentioning the flu per week is a good measure of the CDC's ILI reported data, we plot (in Figure 2 Figure 2 is consistent with Google Flu Trends data when high tweet volumes were witnessed in the week starting January 2, 2011. The CDC has divided the United States into 10 regions as shown in Figure 3 . The CDC publishes their weekly reports on percentage weighted ILI visits collated from its ten regions and aggregates then for United States. Figure 4 compares the OSN dataset with CDC reports with and without text classification for each of the ten regions defined by the CDC and for the entire United States as a whole. We observe that the correlation coefficients have significantly improved with text classification, across all the regions and USA overall. Thus our text classification techniques play a vital role in improving the overall prediction performance.",

On the other hand, the CDC data provides a true, albeit delayed, assessment of a flu epidemic.

For the OSN data, we assume that the most recent data is always available, if a model includes the OSN data terms.

Intuitively, this answers the question of how many weeks of OSN and ILI data should be used to predict the ILI activity in the current week. Within the ranges examined, m = 0 or n = 0 represent models where there are no CDC data, y, or OSN data, u, terms present. Also, if m = 0 and n = 1, we have a linear regression between OSN data and CDC data. If n = 0, we have standard auto-regressive (AR) models.

Due to limited data samples, we adopted the K-fold cross validation approach to test the prediction performance of the models. In a typical K-fold cross validation scheme, the dataset is divided into K (approximately) equally sized subsets. At each step in the scheme, one such subset is used as the test set while all other subsets are used as training samples in order to estimate the model coefficients. Therefore, in a simple case of a 30-sample dataset, 10-fold cross-validation would involve testing 3-samples in each step, while using the other 27 samples to estimate the model parameters.",

(1) ). Therefore, the first sample that can be predicted is y(max(m+ 1, n)) not y (1) . In fact, since we are predicting \"two weeks ahead\" of the available CDC data, the first sample that can be estimated is actually y(max(m + 2, n + 1)). Since, prediction equations cannot be formed for y(1), . . . , y(max(m + 2, n + 1) \u2212 1), those samples were not considered in any of the K subsets during our experiment to be evaluated for prediction performance.

According to the cross validation results in Table 3 1 , the models corresponding to m = 2 and n = 0 have the lowest RMSE for both Twitter and Facebook. This indicates that two most recent data points are required to perform accurate prediction of influenza rates using Twitter or Facebook data. However the model corresponding to m = 1 and n = 2 for the combination of Twitter and Facebook data has the lowest RMSE among all models. Thus the model corresponding to m = 1 and n = 2 is used for accurate prediction of influenza rates and it uses most recent CDC ILI data, in addition to the two most recent OSN data points. In general, the addition of OSN data improves the prediction with past CDC data alone. For the 10-fold cross validation results presented in Table 3 , for example, the AR model (m = 1, n = 0) comprising of the y(t \u2212 2) term and the constant term for the prediction of y(t) has a RMSE of 0.6465. For the same m = 1, the model with additional Twitter data (i.e. n = 1) has a lower RMSE of 0.3708, Facebook data (i.e. n = 1) has a lower RMSE of 0.4088 and combination of Twitter and Facebook data (i.e. n = 1) has a lower RMSE of 0.3553. We observe that the combination of Twitter and Facebook data provides further improvement for prediction accuracy over Twitter and Facebook alone. In this model, using OSN data (m = 0) alone is insufficient for prediction and the past ILI rates are critical in predicting future values, as is evident from our results. Therefore, the OSN data provides a real-time assessment of the flu epidemic (i.e. the availability of Twitter data in week t in the prediction of physician visits also in week t as shown in Eq. (2)), while the past CDC data provides the recent ILI rates in the prediction model. As shown earlier in the paper, there is strong correlation between the OSN data and the CDC data. Hence, the more timely OSN data can compensate for the lack of current CDC data and help capture the current flu trend. Finally in Figure 6 , we provide the plots for percentage weighted ILI visits, positively classified Twitter (left) and Facebook (right) users and predicted ILI rate using CDC and Twitter and Facebook for the year 2010-2011.",

In Region 9, Region 4 and the Northeast, the ILI rates seem to drop off fairly slowly in the weeks immediately following the peaks. This is also reflected in the Twitter reports. Approximately 20-25 weeks after the peak ILI, the northern regions have lower levels relative to the peaks in the southern regions. This is also true of the Twitter reports. The decline in ILI rates is slowest in Region 9. Figure 8 depicts regionwise ILI prediction performance for the year 2010-2011 using our logit model. We select region 1, region 6 and region 9 to represent the regions, one each from the East, South and Western U.S. and plot the actual and predicted ILI values for each of these regions using Twitter data, Facebook data, and the combination of Twitter and Facebook data.
