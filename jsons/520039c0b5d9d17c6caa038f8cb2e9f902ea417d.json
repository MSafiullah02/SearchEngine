MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of the Betacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family, one of the four viral families (together with Arteriviridae, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae) that form the Nidovirales order. This group of viruses includes the largest-sized RNA genomes known, i.e. Roniviridae ($26 kb) and Coronaviridae (from 26.3 to 31.7 kb), as well as the medium-sized Mesoniviridae (20.2 kb) and the small-sized Arteriviridae (12.7-15.7 kb) (Adams et al., 2013) . Despite having a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, all of these viruses protect their genomes of dissimilar size with a nucleoprotein (N). The 5 0 part of the MERS-CoV genome codes for the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed into 16 nonstructural proteins involved in the replication complex. The 3 0 part of the genome codes for viral structural proteins and several accessory proteins, which are translated from a set of subgenomic mRNAs. Among these proteins, the nucleoprotein (N) is a multifunctional protein that plays roles in genome encapsidation (reviewed in Chang et al., 2014) , RNA synthesis during replication, host translational shutoff and innate immunity disruption (McBride et ISSN 2059-7983 # 2019 International Union of Crystallography al., 2014). The coronavirus N is a 40 kDa protein organized into two folded domains that are called the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). They are separated by a disordered region (called LKR) containing a serine/ arginine stretch which could regulate the functions of N upon phosphorylation (He et al., 2004; Surjit et al., 2005; Peng et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009) . Despite many studies, the mechanism by which the RNA genome is encapsidated by N has not been fully unraveled. Indeed, the structure of full-length N is not known, probably owing to its flexibility, and the structures of the NTD and the CTD have been explored separately. However, structural and functional data led to a consensus model in which the formation of the ribonucleocapsid (RNP) requires both multi-site interactions of the RNA along N and oligomerization of N (McBride et al., 2014) . In this model, dimers of N generated through a CTD-CTD dimerization process represent the basic module of the RNP (Yu et al., 2006; Jayaram et al., 2006) . A recent low-resolution electronmicroscopy analysis of N from Murine hepatitis virus seems to converge towards a proposal in which N assembles as small oligomers (from dimers to tetramers) and forms a helical structure in complex with the RNA genome (Gui et al., 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 675, "end": 695, "text": "(Adams et al., 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1307, "text": "Chang et al., 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1428, "text": "ISSN 2059-7983", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1807, "text": "(He et al., 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1828, "text": "Surjit et al., 2005;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1847, "text": "Peng et al., 2008;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1864, "text": "Wu et al., 2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2361, "text": "N (McBride et al., 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2495, "text": "(Yu et al., 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2496, "end": 2517, "text": "Jayaram et al., 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2770, "end": 2788, "text": "(Gui et al., 2017)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The structure of the MERS-CoV NTD has been determined using X-ray crystallography (Papageorgiou et al., 2016) .

A second minor population (elution peak at 22.5 min) that was only observed in the analytical SEC and that also displays an apparent research papers molecular weight (MW) of 29 kDa probably corresponds to the CTD interacting with the silica matrix. Thus, recombinant MERS-CoV CTD is organized in dimers in solution (Fig. 1) ; this result is consistent with previous observations and with the proposal that N dimerizes through its CTD, forming the core unit leading to assembly of the N polymer (Yu et al., 2006; Jayaram et al., 2006) .

The measured dimer dimension of the crystallographic structure that we determined (PDB entry 6g13) is smaller at 5.6 nm. However, ten residues in the N-terminal region of the monomer were not resolved in the crystallographic structure (Thr237-Lys247). These residues contribute to the extra overall length of the molecule. To verify this hypothesis, we modeled these regions using EOM analysis (Ensemble Optimization Method; Bernard\u00f3 et al., 2007) . Using Coot, the ten missing residues were added to the globular part of the molecule and were modeled by EOM keeping the globular part fixed. The EOM calculations resulted in three possible molecular conformations. CRYSOL fits the measured scattering curve with a simulated scattering curve generated using a known X-ray crystal structure. In Fig. 2(d) we show two CRYSOL fits using the two PDB model structures with and without additional amino acids at the N-terminus. More precisely, the CRYSOL fit shown as a blue continuous line corresponds to the crystallographic dimer structure (PDB entry 6g13) with no addition of any supplementary amino acids. The red continuous line is the CRYSOL fit corresponding to a mixture of the three molecular conformations calculated by EOM after the addition of the missing amino acids to the N-terminal region of each monomer.

In this proposed model the growth of the filament is sideways (Ma et al., 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 805, "end": 823, "text": "(Gui et al., 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 881, "end": 898, "text": "(Yu et al., 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 899, "end": 920, "text": "Jayaram et al., 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 921, "end": 937, "text": "Ma et al., 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1207, "text": "(Ma et al., 2010)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 61, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 235, "end": 243, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 299, "end": 307, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 408, "end": 416, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Structure of the MERS-CoV CTD"}, {"text": "The unique asymmetric unit arrangement observed in the MERS-CoV CTD (Fig. 3a) , in which the middle of the -helix bundle of one dimer can interact with the side of the second dimer, suggests that a dimer could prevent the addition of an another 'sideways dimer'.

The overall alignment ( Supplementary Fig. S2a) shows 8.9% identity, highlighting the key residues that are conserved. Considering their positions in the structure, either buried or in loops, we infer that these residues play a structural role to mainly ensure proper folding and/or dimerization ( Supplementary Fig. S2b) .

Analysis of the electrostatic surface highlights these similar characteristics between the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and IBV CTDs, and almost an inversion of the charges in the HCoV-NL63 CTD. Indeed, in the first three dimers the flat side is mostly neutral, while in HCoV-NL63 the charge is negative (Fig. 5, bottom row) . On the -bundle side, a strong positively charged patch is also observed bordering the top and bottom of the dimer, while for the HCoV-63 CTD the bottom and -bundle sides are either mostly neutral, with a small positive patch in the center of the dimer (Fig. 5 , top row). These differences are surprising considering that the sequence of the HCoV-NL63 CTD is not the most distant from that of the MERS-CoV CTD ( Supplementary Fig. S2c) . However, functional studies underscore the role of the CTD in the recognition of the packaging signal in coronaviruses such as Mouse hepatitis virus (Kuo et al., 2014) . In particular, MERS-CoV CTD is able to bind a 45-nucleotide stem-loop structure of the packaging signal sequence (Hsin et al., 2018) . This observation is consistent with previous observations on SARS-CoV N, where the C-terminal domain alone is able to bind RNA but would rather act in cooperation with other RNA-binding sites along N for formation of the ribonucleocapsid (Chang et al., 2009) . In contrast, the CTD of HCoV-NL63, which lacks the positively charged area observed in MERS and SARS-CoV CTD, is not, or is at least poorly, able to bind RNA (Zuwa\u0142a et al., 2015) . Therefore, the structural information described in this study may help to reveal the residues involved in the specific recognition of the packaging signal or possible differences in the mechanisms of RNP assembly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1040, "end": 1058, "text": "(Kuo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1193, "text": "(Hsin et al., 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1454, "text": "(Chang et al., 2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1636, "text": "(Zuwa\u0142a et al., 2015)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 450, "text": "(Fig. 5, bottom row)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 705, "end": 712, "text": "(Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 865, "end": 888, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S2c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "MERS-CoV CTD surface electrostatic conservation"}, {"text": "Aside from its structural role in RNA packaging, MERS-CoV N could also be involved in disease severity by upregulating the cytokine CXCL 10 (Aboagye et al., 2018) .
