Lung ultrasound is an important tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of pneumonia in neonates, children, and adults [2\u20134]. Recent CT reports demonstrated that most of the lesions were distributed peripherally in the lung, which facilitates detection by lung ultrasound [5, 6]. In this study, we characterize the lung ultrasound findings COVID-19 pneumonia, and study the relationship between the ultrasound findings and clinical severity and the time-course of disease progress. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed to detect B-lines, lung consolidation, and pleural line abnormalities at 5 areas in each lung. Vascular ultrasound was also performed to detect potential deep vein thrombosis.",

All patients showed abnormal lung ultrasound findings, including 100% (20) pleural line abnormalities, 100% (20) B-lines, and 50% (10) consolidation. Most of the moderate and severe cases could show both separated B-lines and confluent B-lines during admission. All critical patients showed confluent B-lines, and 18% (2) of them had compact B-lines. Bilateral involvement was observed in all patients. The predominate involved areas in moderate patients were on the back, i.e., the interscapular and infrascapular areas. For severe and critical patients, all 5 areas could be involved. Consolidations were not detected in moderate cases, and distributed mainly on the posterior areas in severe and critical cases. Pleural effusion (18%, 2 cases), pericardial effusion (9%, 1 case), and deep vein thrombosis (64%, 5 cases) were only found in critical patients. (Table 1).\n",

Consolidations were found in more than half examinations after the 1st week. Most of consolidation lesions confined within unilateral lung except at the 2nd week. The anterior and lateral areas were not involved of consolidations during 1st and 4th week. Consolidations were always found in the interscapular and infrascapular areas. Pleural effusion was observed across all stages, but only in a few examinations. The deep vein thrombosis can be found since the 1st week and most prevalent at the 4th week (62.5%, 5 cases).

The composition of different density of B-lines and areas of consolidation showed parallel changes with the clinical severity. The extent of disease demonstrated by ultrasound findings seemed reaching the peak at the 2nd week and recovering gradually thereafter.
