Bibliometric analysis is an important method for scientific research and assessing capability. In this study, 100 pathogens of public health importance were selected, and the distributions of annual, national, institutional, and journal publications were statistically analyzed. The United States of America ranked the first in terms of the number of relevant studies published. China attaches great importance to the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but still needs to improve in the following areas: for example, insufficient Science Citation Index reports on particular pathogens, institutions SCI reports on pathogens lower than world top pathogen research institutions, and lack of influential international pathogen-related journals. Scientific literature databases are important tools for science-of-science analysis. The findings of this study shed light on the hot spots and the ignored spots in pathogen researches, and thus would be useful for drawing a national and institutional research plan.",

The selection of the 100 pathogens was based on their historical importance in infectious diseases or their potential impact on humans, in the case of newer pathogens. Several parasitic pathogens, such as those caused malaria and schistosomiasis, were also included. The pathogens were selected from the laboratory biosafety pathogen lists of the National Institutes of Health of the United States, the European Union, and China; the bioterrorism response pathogen lists of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the European Union, and Russia; and select agent program pathogens listed by the United States [4] . Additionally, the World Health Organization's list of key emerging pathogens for preparedness and response [5] , the list of pathogens released by Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases [6] , and the pathogens listed in some Chinese textbooks were also referred to [7] [8] [9] [10] . The pathogenicity and epidemiologic potential of the pathogens were considered in the selection process.",

The Web of Science literature database does not distinguish the first author from the other authors for country-wise and institution-wise analysis, so the cumulative number of studies for each country or institution may higher than the total number of studies.Table 1.

Journals with the highest number of published studies on select pathogens From the quantitative analysis of studies on the selected pathogens, the following characteristics were evidenced\uff1a(1) The number of studies is closely related to disease epidemics. Some pathogens, such as SARS coronavirus, H1N1 influenza virus, and Ebola virus, have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of studies published after the disease outbreaks. However, once the epidemic has been controlled, the number of studies declined.(2) The number of studies was closely related to disease distribution. The number of studies related to pathogens tended to be related to the geographical distribution of the corresponding diseases. For example, the literatures on H7N9 avian influenza is predominate in China, while the most relevant literatures on Burkholderia pseudomallei is in Thailand.
