In the last decade, most viruses were detected every year, except for PIV2. To obtain a clearer picture of seasonality within a year, the cases due to each virus were also aggregated into months (Figure 3). Disease activity due to the main respiratory viruses was present throughout the year, with yearly peaks of activity. RSV showed the most pronounced seasonality, with peak activity at the year-end (September-December), and lowest activity in mid-year (April-June). PIV-1 and PIV-3 virus activity was mainly seen in March-May. The number of PIV-2 cases was too small to detect any seasonality. Influenza A was seen throughout the year, with peak activity in May, while there was more obvious increased influenza B virus activity between November-March. Adenovirus activity was present all year-round, with a peak in February-March.",

Our laboratory does not routinely detect rhinoviruses, but RSV was the most frequently detected respiratory virus, particularly in infants less than one year old. This suggests that maternal antibodies were ineffective in preventing RSV infections. Older children may be less prone to RSV infection due to the maturity of their immune system or natural immunity obtained through repeated infections of RSV. The burden of RSV in young infants in tropical countries, including Malaysia, emphasizes the likely global benefits of developing a safe and effective vaccine for RSV. Our data also showed a slight male preponderance (59.8%) in children with respiratory viral infections, consistent with other studies [25].",

In our study, the common respiratory viruses were detected throughout the year. The RSV annual epidemics are strongly seasonal, while seasonality is less clear for influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, which may be due to the smaller number of cases. For adenovirus, most studies show sporadic occurrence without any seasonal trend [28,29]. In the tropics, influenza occurs all year-round [29], similar to our data. In Singapore, parainfluenza virus type 3 was the most commonly detected parainfluenza virus type, with seasonal peaks in February-March similar to our results [29].",

In contrast, in neighbouring Singapore (latitude 1\u00b0N) and Lombok, Indonesia (latitude 8\u00b0S), RSV peaks around March-August [29,30]. In most RSV studies carried out in temperate countries, where temperature varies widely between seasons, temperature is highly inversely correlated to RSV cases [4,31]. We also found a negative correlation between RSV and temperature in tropical Kuala Lumpur, where the much reduced temperature variation may explain the weaker correlation (correlation coefficient of -0.116). As previously observed in Indonesia [32], we also found that the number of rain days was significantly associated with RSV cases, but not rainfall. Malaysia experiences brief, intense showers of rainfall, as well as prolonged episodes of light rainfall. Therefore, the number of rain days may have a greater influence than the absolute amount of rainfall on behaviours such as children staying indoors, thus increasing close contact and indoor transmission of respiratory viruses [33].",

We were unable to obtain dates of admission for the earlier patients, and thus could not differentiate between nosocomial and community-acquired viral infections. However, we have previously found that nosocomial cases made up 25/157 (15.9%) influenza cases from 2002-2007 [13] and 17/146 (11.6%) RSV cases from 1989-2010 (Khor CS, Sam IC and Chan YF, unpublished observations). These nosocomial rates of respiratory viral infections are similar to previously published rates of 12.1-13.8% [36,37], thus supporting the likelihood that the majority of infections seen in our study were community-acquired. Over 27 years, there may have been changes in physicians' practices, such as criteria for taking specimens and admitting patients, and types of samples collected. Furthermore, with a relatively low IF sensitivity of 55.8% using virus isolation as the gold standard, there is likely to be considerable underdiagnosis of viral infections compared to molecular methods [38]. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, these unusually extensive records kept over 27 years provide valuable insight into current and historical respiratory virus epidemiology in a tropical Southeast Asian country, particularly with the limited available facilities for virus diagnosis. To extend these findings, we are currently carrying out prospective studies using molecular methods to detect a wider range of respiratory viruses.",

Duplicate positive samples collected from the same patient within a week were removed from analysis.
