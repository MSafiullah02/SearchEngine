Genomic variants of HAdV were shown to be associated with severe respiratory disease.24, 25 In this study, HAdV C1, C2, C5, B3, and B7 were identified as the predominant types detected in patients with severe respiratory infection. The detection of HAdV in a respiratory specimen should be interpreted with caution because asymptomatic HAdV shedding is known to occur. HAdV C persists in the adenoids and tonsils and is shed for prolonged periods after symptoms resolve.26, 27, 28 However, 75% of patients with HAdV infection had Ct values less than 30 cycles, suggesting acute infection rather than persistent shedding. Furthermore, several studies have suggested an association between mixed viral detection and disease severity.29, 30 Co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses was observed in 44% of patients infected with HAdV, and rhinovirus was the most commonly detected co\u2010infecting virus.

A retrospective review of adenovirus infections at Texas Children's Hospital during 1990\u20101996 showed that disseminated adenovirus disease in children occurred in 11 (2.5%) out of 440 adenovirus\u2010infected patients, and the mortality rate was 83% and 60% among immunocompromised and immunocompetent children, respectively. In that study, HAdVs C5, B3, and B7 were associated with disseminated disease and multi\u2010organ involvement in immunocompetent children, whereas HAdVs C1 and C2 were the cause of severe outcomes in immunocompromised children.11 Again, a role for co\u2010detected rhinoviruses in patients\u2019 deaths should not be excluded, as discussed above. Moreover, another HAdV C5 strain (18368) with high sequence similarity to the 64021 strain was detected in a 2\u2010year\u2010old boy suffering from pneumonia, who was admitted to the pediatric ICU of the same hospital 8 months later. No other viruses were found in the pharyngeal aspirate within the detection limit of the assay, and therefore, a role for co\u2010infection in the development of severe respiratory disease in that boy was excluded.",
