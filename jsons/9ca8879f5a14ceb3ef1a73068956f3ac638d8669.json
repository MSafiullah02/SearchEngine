Central nervous system (CNS) infection and neurological involvement have also been reported in CCHF. In the current study, we inoculated NSG-SGM3 mice engrafted with human hematopoietic CD34 + stem cells with low-passage CCHF virus strains isolated from human patients. In humanized mice, lethal disease develops, characterized by histopathological change in the liver and brain. To date, targets of neurological infection and disease have not been investigated in CCHF. CNS disease in humanized mice was characterized by gliosis, meningitis, and meningoencephalitis, and glial cells were identified as principal targets of infection. Humanized mice represent a novel lethal model for studies of CCHF countermeasures, and CCHF-associated CNS disease. Our data suggest a role for astrocyte dysfunction in neurological disease and identify key regions of infection in the CNS for future investigations of CCHF.",

Disease can vary from mild, nonspecific febrile illness to severe hemorrhagic clinical signs. Neurological involvement in CCHF was also described in the seminal report on the 1944 outbreak in Soviet troops in the Crimean peninsula, in which general cerebral, meningeal, and slight psychological and neurological symptoms were noted as the most characteristic clinical features in these cases [1] . Based on these findings and degeneration of the autonomic nervous system observed in later cases, CCHFV was considered by early researchers to be a neurotropic virus [2] .",

Hu-NSG-SGM3 mice, derived from NSG-SGM3 (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl Tg [CMV-IL3, CSF2, KITLG] 1Eav/MloySzJ) mice, are irradiated and intravenously injected with human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells. We infected SGM3 humanized mice with 2 strains of CCHFV isolated from human patients in Oman (CCHFV-OM) or Turkey (CCHFV-TR). All mice infected with CCHFV-TR developed progressive disease, with high levels of viral antigen in the liver, spleen, and brain. In mice that succumbed to disease, the highest level of virus, detected with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, was in the brain. In contrast, all mice infected with CCHFV-OM exhibited mild clinical signs and recovered; viral antigen was uniformly absent in the brains of these mice. Viral antigen was primarily detected in glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, and in the meninges. These finding indicate that neuropathology, which included gliosis and meningitis/meningoencephalitis, is a key component of disease in this model. In addition to providing a lethal model for therapeutic studies, humanized mice can be used for further investigations of CCHF-associated neuropathogenesis in vivo.",

Three mice per group, and a control, were euthanized 4 days after infection to assess clinical chemistry findings (Supplementary Figure S1) , and viral replication early in infection. The other animals were followed up clinically and sampled as described above, after euthanasia due to disease or at study completion (33 days after infection). Animals inoculated with CCHFV-OM (n = 6) exhibited minimal weight loss and recovered (maximum median loss at 2 days after infection, 4.99% \u00b1 4.47% SD; maximum absolute loss at 3 days after infection, 16.7%; Figure 1A ). In contrast, animals inoculated with CCHFV-TR (n = 5) displayed slow progressive weight loss, ultimately requiring euthanasia at 13, 20, or 23 days after infection ( Figure 1B ). Viral RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR in blood and tissues of CCHFV-inoculated SGM3 humanized mice ( Figure 1C ). At 4 days after infection, viral RNA was detected in all blood and tissue samples analyzed from mice infected with either CCHFV-OM or CCHFV-TR. High levels of viral RNA were detected in the brains of CCHFV-TR-infected animals that succumbed to disease, up to 2 logs higher than levels in CCHFV-OM animals at study completion. Ocular involvement is reported in other neurotropic viral infections. Thus, after virus was detected at high levels in brains of mice that succumbed to disease at 13 days after infection, ocular samples were collected for PCR analyses in the remaining mice (TR-5 and TR-6, n = 2; OM-4 through OM-9, n = 6); viral RNA was detected in all ocular samples from CCHFV-inoculated mice, regardless of strain.",

However, in infected mice that were euthanized, either because of disease or at the scheduled end of the experiment, hCD45 + levels were significantly lower than in controls, regardless of virus strain. This may represent apoptosis or direct infection of these cells by CCHFV or may be due to cellular localization to sites that were not sampled. Both phenotypic activation on T cells and cytotoxic functional activity were assessed in the mice. Up-regulation of HLA-DR and CD38, markers of human T-cell activation [18, 19] , was observed in all humanized mice infected with CCHFV, regardless of strain, sample time point, or disease outcome (Figure 2A ). The early activation marker CD69 was also examined but was not notably elevated at any time point on either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in infected mice compared with control mice (Supplementary A B C D Figure 3 . Extraneural histological analysis of humanized mice infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHVF). Pulmonary, hepatic, and splenic findings described in control mice, including the presence of mixed inflammatory infiltrate, were also noted in CCHFV-infected humanized mice and considered secondary to factors outside the experimental viral infection. A, In contrast to control mice, an increase in individual hepatocellular death was observed both within the inflammatory foci (yellow arrows) and randomly throughout the parenchyma (white arrows). Vacuolar degeneration, indicating hepatocellular damage, was also noted in some animals (blue arrow). B, In the liver, with use of an anti-CCHFV antibody, immunoreactivity was seen in histiocytes and multinucleated giant macrophages within hepatic inflammatory foci (left image), Kupffer cells (black arrow), and rare hepatocytes (white arrow). C, D, Rare staining was also noted within mononuclear cells in the lung (C) and in mesenchymal connective tissue that remained adherent to organs when sampled at necropsy, such as perirenal adipose (D). Figure S2 ). Of note, elevated levels of perforin, a marker of cytotoxic functional activity, were observed in the CD8 + T cells of the mice that had to be euthanized after CCHFV-TR infection ( Figure 2B ). It is unclear whether this represents a population of CD8 + T cells that could manage to nonspecifically kill infected cells in these animals or a population of CD8 + T cells that were contributing to immune-mediated disease.",

However, in all evaluated CCHFV-TR mice and in OM-9, individual cell death was more frequent and both present within inflammatory foci and randomly distributed throughout the parenchyma ( Figure 3A ). In addition, vacuolar degeneration was noted in some animals, as well as a mild ductular reaction. In contrast, the remaining CCHFV-OM mice exhibited only rare, single-cell hepatocyte death associated with the inflammatory foci, similar to the control mice. Histopathological changes in lungs and spleens of infected humanized mice were consistent with those observed in control mice. Other tissues examined, including heart, eye, kidney, adrenal gland, and ovary/uterus, revealed no significant findings. Immunohistochemistry for CCHFV showed staining in the liver, spleen, lungs, and adrenal glands (Table 1 ). In the liver, strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was noted primarily in histiocytes and multinucleated giant macrophages within inflammatory foci; sinusoidal lining cells, including Kupffer cells and endothelial cells; and in rare hepatocytes ( Figure 3B) . Immunoreactivity was noted within rare mononuclear cells consistent with histiocytes in the splenic white pulp (consistent with dendritic cells) and in perivascular inflammatory foci within the lungs ( Figure 3C ). Small numbers of mesenchymal cells in connective and adipose tissues that were adherent to organs were immunoreactive, including tissues surrounding organs in which immunostaining was not observed (kidney, eye, heart; Figure 3D ), which may explain viral RNA detection by PCR in organs that were negative by immunohistochemistry. Finally, rare spindle cells consistent with endothelial cells had cytoplasmic staining in the adrenal gland of 2 animals (TR-4 and TR-6 at 20 and 23 days after infection, respectively).",

In 1 animal (TR-4, at 20 days after infection), multiple astrocytic foci were present in the cerebellar cortex, with cell bodies within the Purkinje layer, consistent with Bergmann glial cells ( Figure 6A and 6B ).

This included both single glial and neuronal cells, and clusters of neurons localized to specific nuclei, such as the habenular nucleus ( Figure 5A ).

Viral RNA was detected in the brains of humanized mice at 4 days after infection, increased over time, and had its highest levels in the brains of mice that succumbed to disease. In contrast, CCHFV is detected in the brains of IFNAR -/and STAT-1 -/mice, but at lower levels than in other tissues (eg, liver and spleen) [9, 11] . This difference is probably due to the length of the clinical course in each model; the rapid, acute nature of disease in IFNAR -/and STAT-1 -/mice (< 7 days) may prohibit high levels of viral dissemination into the brain, as seen in other models of viral infection when disease course is abbreviated rather than prolonged (eg, Nipah virus) [30] .",

As described in human cases, we detected CCHFV antigen in endothelial cells of several organs, including the liver and adrenal gland. These findings, including viral tropism for endothelial cells and histopathological evidence of vascular leakage in the brain, along with previous reports of vascular compromise, support hematogenous entry of CCHFV through a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) at the level of the brain microvessel endothelium. Given the propensity for glial cell infection in the brains of the SGM3 humanized mice, CCHFV entry is probably enhanced by activation of astrocytes and impairment of their contribution to barrier function. Foot processes from astrocytes form a complex network surrounding the capillaries, and this close cell association is important in induction and maintenance of the barrier properties [32] . Glial cells form a structural framework to support neuronal cells and play a role in preventing pathogen entry into the brain. Morphological and functional BBB characteristics depend on the CNS environment and on the contribution of perivascular astrocytes [33, 34] . Furthermore, an astrocyte-mediated bystander effect has been described with other encephalitic viruses, in which infected astrocytes in an endothelial cell coculture model increased permeability of the endothelium, causing endothelial cell apoptosis, morphologically altered astrocytes, and gap junction-dependent disruptions in signaling between uninfected and infected cells [35] . Altogether, infection of glial cells and astrocytes provides a mechanism of disease consistent with reports of increased permeability in brain membranes of patients [2, 5] .",

CCHFV has demonstrated neurotropism in severe disease [3] , but to our knowledge there have been no detailed investigations of CNS infection. Neither of the 2 reports of histopathological findings in human CCHF cases included findings in nervous tissue [27, 49] , and CCHF research has been limited to severely immunocompromised mouse strains that develop rapid, acute disease prohibiting dissemination to the CNS. Although limitations remain in the use of humanized mouse models, these models have been instrumental in studies of human-specific viruses, bacteria, and parasites [50] .",

Answers to these questions will be instrumental in determining the public health impact of CNS infection by CCHFV, guiding appropriate clinical care for patients, and developing targeted medical countermeasures.",
