When accounting for premature mortality and disability, the fraction of the global burden of disease due to the environment was 22% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13\u201332%) (WHO, 2016). In children aged below 5 years, up to 26% (95% CI: 16\u201338%) of all deaths could be prevented if environmental risks were removed. Environmental factors might play a role in more than 80% of major diseases and injuries around the world and are among the biggest killers. Diseases with the largest environmental contribution in children under the age of 5 years include lower respiratory infections (32%), diarrhoeal diseases (22%), neonatal conditions (15%) and parasitic and vector-borne diseases (12%) (WHO, 2017).",

Several millions of children die each year from acute diarrheal diseases, and the majority of these deaths are likely due to contaminated food or water. Hence, it is important for public health interventions to pay particular attention to these two diseases. However, the true burden of food-borne and water-borne diseases is difficult to quantify. The challenges in many parts of the world concern how to generate evidence on risks related to environmental contaminations under climate change in different contexts, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).",

(ii) How can we implement integrated approaches (e.g. Ecohealth and One Health) which are able to tackle the particular challenges of water and food contaminations, from the source to the consumption by the end-users?

The key terms used in different single searches or in combinations were as follows: water-borne diseases, food-borne diseases, climate change, selected countries (e.g. Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Nepal), Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, and America. There was no limitation of the time period, but I gave priority to scientific papers, reports and literature issued in the past 10 years, with a few exceptions related generally to immutable definitions and concepts. The objectives of the review were: (i) to obtain relevant information on the major concepts, facts and figures related to the two disease clusters (i.e. food- and water-borne diseases) and the links between the diseases and environmental factors and (ii) to identify and describe examples of projects related to the particular role of WASH among environmental factors in the prevention of infectious diseases under climate change. For these examples, following the clarification provided by Fig. 1 and the text above, showing the potential links between climate change and food- and water-borne diseases, I looked after two illustrative project-based case studies, one from each: (i) the potential impact of climate extreme events on infectious diseases through water systems, and (ii) the potential effects of integrated WASH interventions on infectious diseases among school-aged children. For these two case studies, I undertook a review of the respective projects\u2019 literature (published protocols and papers, policy briefs and other documentation).",

The risks of contamination exist in the food chain, from food production to consumption (\u201cfarm to fork\u201d), and involve the pollution of water, soil or air. The estimation of food-borne disease burden is complicated because most of the hazards causing food-borne diseases are not transmitted solely by food (Hald et al., 2016); most have several potential exposure routes consisting of transmission from animals, by humans and via environmental routes, including water. As water plays a major role in the burden of food-borne diseases, the separation of food and water as exposure vehicles is difficult, particularly at the community level. Table 1\npresents the different bacterial, viral, protozoan and toxic agents that are associated with food-borne and water-borne illnesses in humans (Acheson, 2009).",

The city has no sewerage system, and families are mainly using on-site sanitation facilities. A number of socio-economic activities occur in the river (e.g. fishing, urban agriculture) involving vulnerable groups including women.

The component aimed at ensuring hygiene in the food chain from production to the eating table, giving particular attention to what the children do or find regarding WASH conditions after attending school (e.g. in the streets or at home).

In Burkina Faso, a total of 360 school-aged children (182 boys and 178 girls) has complete data records (baseline and 1-year follow-up data) (Erismann et al., 2017). In Nepal, a total of 562 children aged 8\u201315 years had complete data records (Shrestha et al., 2017). In both Nepal and Burkina, between the baseline and the end-line, a significant decrease in total intestinal parasitic infections in both intervention and control schools was found, but most importantly in intervention schools. For example, in Burkina Faso, the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections decreased both in intervention and control schools, but the decrease was significantly higher in the intervention schools compared to the control schools (odds ratio [OR] of the intervention effect = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1\u20130.5); and safe hand washing practices before eating and the use of latrines at schools were significantly higher in the intervention schools than in the control schools at the end-line (OR = 6.9, 95% CI = 1.4\u201334.4, and OR = 14.9, 95% CI = 1.4\u2013153.9, respectively) (Erismann et al., 2017).",
