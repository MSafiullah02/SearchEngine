            "text": "The patient-physician relationship has traditionally been centered around face-to-face contact, be it at a house-call, an outpatient visit, or during a hospitalization. This relationship cemented by the image of the careful assessment of the pulse by a physician or a thoughtful physical examination has been immortalized in countless books and movies. Historically, while the applicability, convenience and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine has been recognized and supported by a scattering of evidence, telemedicine has not gained widespread popularity for a number of reasons 1, 2 . Both patients and providers have remained unconvinced that it can replace the value of a face-to-face encounter, and importantly, reimbursement for telephone or videobased appointments have been a fraction of in-person care, thereby limiting the adoption of this technology. However, the unprecedented challenges thrust upon the healthcare system by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought telemedicine to the forefront on a broad scale as never before. In an attempt to minimize healthcare-associated transmission of the SARS-CoV2 infection and protect patients and providers, most major healthcare systems in the United States have shut down routine outpatient clinical care. Instead, and almost overnight, the traditional face-to-face care has been widely replaced by telephone-or video-based visits. While the initial impetus for this was to minimize disruption to patient care rather than a financial incentive, an important step legitimizing this as an acceptable and equivalent mechanism for care delivery were steps such as those announced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services whereby video-based telemedicine visits would be reimbursed at parity with office-based appointments on a temporary and emergency basis. Hence, it is highly plausible that telemedicine is here to stay.",

How the patient carries themselves, whether they are comfortable or in distress, are important components of the overall assessment of the clinical status of the patient but cannot be inferred remotely with both parties seated at their video screens from the beginning to the end of the visit. Anecdotally in our personal experience, telemedicine visits have been significantly shorter than face-to-face encounters with the same patient. Whether the shortening of the fifteen-minute in person visit to a five-minute video call just distills out the extraneous without meaningfully impacting patient care or whether the gap represents questions that were unasked and unanswered can be debated, but will likely include parts of both. Indeed, the 'meaningless' chatter at the beginning and end of in-person visits may strengthen the patient-provider relationship, encouraging adherence to therapy and demonstrating openness to engagement; and this relationship-building may end up being sacrificed at the altar of telemedicine. Though the population as a whole is more technologically-savvy than a couple of decades ago, certain patient populations including the elderly and socio-economically or developmentally disadvantaged may not be in a position to participate or benefit optimally from telemedicine consultations, and thus this system has the potential to unintentionally create bias.",

To do so, would be an enormous disservice. As the study in this issue of the journal emphasizes, telemedicine has the potential to be significantly cost-saving to the healthcare system and indeed to society. In regions of the country where specialist centers are few and far between, telemedicine is critical to allow many patients to benefit from remote specialist care, ensuring they have access to the stateof-the art treatment algorithms in spite of the geographic distance. For the stable, well-controlled patient or a general well-visit, an in-person office visit may often mean several hours away from home or work in terms of commute, waiting, and the visit itself. Telemedicine will be an attractive alternative in that setting. Indeed, the efficiency conferred by incorporating telemedicine for such situations may free up office-and provider-time for other patients-in-need.",

            "text": "is a cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized trial which demonstrated that the use of the myIBDcoach telemedicine portal reduced the number of outpatient gastroenterologist visits and hospitalizations in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) when compared to standard of care; of note, there was no difference in the rate of emergency visits, number of flares or quality of life between the 2 groups 4 . In this analysis, the authors estimate a cost saving of 547 Euros per patient annually, which if extrapolated to the over 3 million individuals with IBD in Europe, could result in substantially lower health expenditure related to IBD with telemedicine compared to traditional care. In a real-world setting, Allocca et al. describe their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic in Milan where virtual consultations resulted in minimal disruptions to clinical care of established patients or those enrolled in clinical trials though new patient appointments were deferred 5 . Other randomized trials in IBD have similarly demonstrated a telemedicine-based approach to be effective in improving disease activity 6 , reducing IBD-related hospitalizations 7 , and improving disease-related knowledge 8 . There are fewer rigorous studies of telehealth for other gastrointestinal diseases and benefits have been noted in some but not all studies 9 . Telemedicine has demonstrated benefit in improving outcomes in patients with diabetes 10 and heart failure 11 though not all studies have unequivocally demonstrated benefit. Apart from direct care delivered through telemedicine, integration of smart-phone linked sensors have also similarly demonstrated modest benefit, at best 12 . While the study by de Jong et al. suggests that for patients with IBD, a telemedicine approach can be cost-saving in the context of a clinical trial, there are many unanswered questions that remain in translating this to routine care post COVID-19. While a brief telemedicine visit may work well for monitoring of well-controlled chronic diseases on stable therapy in an engaged patient groups, whether it would offer the same degree of reassurance and empathy in a patient newly confronted with a challenging diagnosis (for example, a new diagnosis of IBD) or treatment choice (example, initiation of long-term immunosuppressive therapy or consideration of a permanent stoma) remains to be established. Indeed, one cannot yet envision counseling a patient about a new diagnosis of advanced-stage cancer or the futility of further treatment over a telemedicine portal. The art of medicine often involves assessment of the unspoken, an exchange of a furtive glance between the child and the parent or between spouses,",
