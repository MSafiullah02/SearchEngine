Furthermore, controversies exist regarding the treatment effect of the target drugs for different pulmonary hypertension (PH) types, demonstrated by the unknown effect of PAH-targeted drugs for combined pre-and post-capillary PH secondary to left heart failure. Taken together, more aggressive and non-medication-based treatment may be useful for PAH or PH. To do so, the NHC team first proposed and reported on pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) for both PAH and PH in 2013. Then a follow-up study confirmed the improvement in 6min-walk distance, haemodynamics and exercise capacity.",

In Northern Italy, the emergency is progressively involving all cardiology ICUs, not in order to manage cardiovascular complications of the viral infection, but simply to offer beds for treatment of the severe respiratory failure caused by viral interstitial pneumonia. However, the net effect of this reorganization that has been imposed by local and national health authorities is a significant reduction of sites and staff committed to the 'usual' treatment of cardiovascular disease. In particular, elective cardiothoracic operations and interventional procedures are being cancelled. The restriction of free movement between regions imposed by the central government adds to this, with a reduction of cardiology outpatients who-despite everything-decide to access our clinics. This viral emergency, limiting our ability to manage the medical repercussions in the first instance, could have detrimental effects on the entire health system.",

In this way, despite the data showing that prognosis is benign in 90% of cases, the affected individual-and the physician particularly-needs to manage a variable but creeping burden of anxiety. Outside the clinical context, all (both affected and unaffected) will experience increased anxiety due to travel restrictions, change in working hours and habits and not being able to go out to a bar, caf\u00e9, or restaurant.

In truth however, this change is by no means simple or automatic. The sudden excess of free time is surprising and leaves a hollow feeling. One realizes how much our usual rhythm, imposed by anxiety and our too many engagements, are actually necessary to maintain an active and productive intellect. Indeed, the restriction of personal contact-that is sometimes yearned for in times of excessive meetings and boards-suddenly becomes a burden. One ascertains for oneself what we try to teach our children and students, i.e. that the internet and social media are not able to surrogate direct personal contact.",
