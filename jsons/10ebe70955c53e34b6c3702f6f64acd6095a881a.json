            "text": "Respiratory virus infections contribute substantially both to hospitalizations of young children, and to morbidity in immunocompromised patients such as those with hematological malignancies. Their rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential to patient management. To evaluate the prospective utility of Seeplex 1 DPO technology in respiratory virus diagnosis, a panel of 99 respiratory samples positive by real-time RT-PCR for one or more viruses was assayed by the Seegene Seeplex 1 RV12 system. As well as being able to detect all 10 viruses in the realtime RT-PCR system with the exception of enteroviruses, RV12 can also distinguish between the two subgroups of RSV and detect two subgroups of coronaviruses. Seven of the nine viruses in common with the RT-PCR were detected reliably by RV12. Eleven samples RT-PCR-positive for Metapneumovirus and five samples positive for influenza B were not detected by RV12. Seegene developed a second-generation system, RV15, which not only allowed detection of three additional viruses, but also addressed the potential problems with RV12 specificity. To address these concerns, 84 respiratory samples positive for a range of viruses by real-time PCR were assayed with RV15. The results of this evaluation improved significantly upon those seen with RV12. The high throughput capabilities and potential lower technical requirements afforded by the Seeplex 1 system may offer an alternative to real-time RT-PCR systems.",

Whilst direct comparison of the two systems is limited, due to the sample sets having been pre-determined to be positive for one or more target viruses by one system, it can be stated that the overall performance of the Seeplex 1 RV12 and RV15 systems was very good, with several instances of viruses being detected where the RT-PCR system had either failed or had been unable to do so.

However, both MPNV and FLB targets were detected poorly by RV12, with concomitant low band intensities from samples where these targets were detected. Revision of the primer sets was a key component of the development of RV15. RV15 gave a 100% detection rate of all viruses detected by RT-PCR, including seven MPNV-positive samples, but no improvement in FLB detection. The latter primer set was modified further, and retesting the panel of known FLB-positive samples gave substantially greater success. Although these new primers have since been included in the RV15, further evaluation within a standard Seeplex 1 multiplex PCR format is required. A limitation to the Seeplex 1 system is its internal control facility. The artificial targets included in each PCR mastermix allows validation only of the PCR step, whereas the addition of PDV to each extraction allows the RT-PCR system also to control for both the RNA extraction and the reverse transcription step. Inhibition of the RT-PCR system, detected by poorly amplifying PDV target, occurs with a not insignificant frequency; it is essential to report that a lack of virus detection is not due to any technical deficiency within the system.",
