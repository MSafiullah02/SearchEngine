Several infections in Asia were reported subsequently, alerting the world that it remains at risk of another outbreak of SARS (World Health Organization: Severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2020\n).

PL2pro cleaves at three sites in the N-proximal regions of the two polyproteins, whereas Mpro cleaves at 11 sites in the central and C-proximal regions of the two polyproteins. Mpro releases the key proteins in viral replication, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the helicase.7 Playing such an essential role, SARS-CoV Mpro is an attractive molecular target for the development of anti-SARS drugs acting as the inhibitors of the peptidase.",

Domain I (residues 8 to 101) and domain II (residues 102 to 184) comprise a two-\u03b2-barrel fold similar to that of the chymotrypsin-type serine peptidases. Domain III (residues 201 to 300) has five \u03b1-helices and is connected to domain II by a long loop (residues 185 to 200). Each protomer has its own substrate-binding region situated in the cleft between domains I and II.13 A recent mutagenesis study has confirmed that Mpro is a cysteine peptidase with a Cys-His catalytic dyad at the active site.14 As suggested by the structure-based sequence alignment of the main peptidases (including their flanking residues in the polyproteins) from SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses,15 and confirmed by in vitro studies,7, 9 these peptidases preferentially cleave at a consensus sequence for the P4 to P1\u2032 residues of substrates (nomenclature based on that of Schechter and Berger16): (amino acid with a small side-chain)-(any amino acid)-Leu-Gln\u2193(Ala, Ser, Gly).",

The side-chain of the P1 residue predominantly determines the target-peptidase specificity of an APE. The substituent on the epoxide C2 atom also allows some tuning of both the inhibitory activity and specificity of APE towards a particular target peptidase. The aza-peptide component resembles a peptide, except that the C\u03b1 atom of the P1 residue in the former is replaced by a nitrogen atom to form an aza-amino acid residue. This introduces trigonal planar geometry to the \u03b1-atom of the P1 residue and reduces the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom of the P1 residue, thereby making the carbonyl group of the P1 residue resistant to nucleophilic attack.28 It has been proposed that APEs inhibit their target peptidases irreversibly by a mechanism in which the catalytic Cys S\u03b3 atom nucleophilically attacks one of the two epoxide carbon atoms (C2 or C3) of APE (Figure 1\n(a)).24, 26, 27 This results in the opening of the conformationally strained epoxide ring, and the formation of a covalent bond between the Cys S\u03b3 atom and the attacked APE atom.",

Accordingly, we synthesized Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(S,S)EP-COOEt and Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(R,R)EP-COOEt. Micromolar quantities of the S,S diastereomer strongly inhibited the cleavage of a peptidic substrate, manifesting itself as a pronounced slowing of the reaction velocity as the reaction progressed (Figure 1(b)). Under these conditions, the R,R diastereomer did not detectably inhibit Mpro. Analysis of the rates of inactivation (j\ns) at different concentrations of substrate and inhibitor indicated that APE inhibited Mpro with a k\ninact/K\ni=1900(\u00b1400) M\u22121\n s\u22121.",

            "text": "We have determined the crystal structures of SARS-CoV Mpro in three forms: wild-type peptidase in the absence and presence of APE in the space group C2, and a variant of the peptidase with an Ala added to the N terminus of the wild-type sequence, M+A(\u22121)pro, bound by APE in the space group P212121. The parameters and statistics derived from X-ray diffraction data processing and structure refinement are summarized in Table 1\n. For unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex in the space group C2, each asymmetric unit has only one protomer of the dimer. The two protomers of each dimer are related by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Figure 2\n). All residues of the protomer (residues 1 to 306) were identified in the electron density maps. In the Ramachandran plot for the structure of unbound Mpro, Asp33, Ala46 and Glu47 are in the generously allowed regions, whereas Asn84, Tyr154 and Ile286 are in the disallowed regions. The Asp33 O\u03b42 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the Tyr101 phenolic OH group (2.9 \u00c5). The Asn84 N\u03b42 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu178 carbonyl O atom (3.2 \u00c5), and possibly there are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces between the side-chains of Asn84 and Lys180 as well. Hydrophobic interactions occur between the side-chains of Thr285 and Ile286 of opposite protomers at the dimer interface. The electron densities for the side-chains of Ala46, Glu47 and Tyr154 are not well defined. Similarly, in the Ramachandran plot for the structure of the Mpro:APE complex, Asp33, Asn84, Tyr154 and Asn277 are in the generously allowed region, whereas Ile286 is in the disallowed region. The electron densities for Tyr154 and Asn277 are not well defined. For the M+A(\u22121)pro:APE complex in the space group P212121, there is a dimer in each asymmetric unit. Only the residues 1A to 304A and residues 1B to 300B were identified in the electron density maps. In the Ramachandran plot for this structure, Asp33 and Asn84 of both protomers are in the generously allowed regions, whereas Tyr154 and Ile286 of both protomers are in the disallowed regions. The electron density for Tyr154 is not well defined. Superimposition (see Materials and Methods) of protomers A and B yielded a root-mean-square difference (rmsd) of 0.29 \u00c5. Positional differences (up to 4.18 \u00c5) occur mainly among the N and C-terminal residues as well as those poorly defined residues on the flexible loops. The three structures are in close agreement (Table 2\n). With regard to the protomer orientation and protein fold, these structures, in general, are identical with the crystal structures of Mpro previously determined in the space group P21.13\n",

            "text": "Crystals of SARS-CoV Mpro and M+A(\u22121)pro were soaked in the solutions of Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(S,S)EP-COOEt, Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(R,R)EP-COOEt, and a racemic mixture of the S,S and R,R diastereomers (trans). Only the S,S diastereomer showed up in the electron density maps. APE binds in the substrate-binding regions of Mpro (Figure 3\n(a) and (b)). As visualized in all three structures, the residues forming the substrate-binding regions of both protomers of the peptidase are in the catalytically competent conformation, similar to their counterparts in the structures of the main peptidases from other coronaviruses,15, 29 and to those in protomer A of the P21 structures of SARS-CoV Mpro.13 In the structure of unbound Mpro, the catalytic dyad has a distance of 3.7 \u00c5 between the His41 N\u03b52 atom and the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom, and the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom is coplanar with the atoms of the His41 imidazole ring. Superimposition of the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex shows that the binding of APE does not cause any major changes in the structure of the peptidase (Table 2). The Cys145 C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b2 bond undergoes a 95\u00b0 rotation (\u03c71: from \u221264.0\u00b0 to +30.7\u00b0) accompanying the formation of a covalent bond with a distance of 2.01 \u00c5 between the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom of the peptidase and the epoxide C3 atom of APE (Figure 4\n(a) and (b)). The length of a C\u2013S single bond is normally about 1.8 \u00c5. However, with an estimated overall coordinate error (based on maximum likelihood) of 0.12 \u00c5 for the structure of the Mpro:APE complex, the difference between the refined and expected distances (0.2 \u00c5) is not considered significant. This new covalent bond makes a torsion angle, O\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC(P1-AGln)-C3(epoxide)-S\u03b3(Cys145), of 65.4\u00b0 (Figure 5\n(c)). The epoxide ring of APE opens, leaving a hydroxyl group on the C2 atom to form hydrogen bonds with the Asn142 O\u03b41 atom of the peptidase (2.9 \u00c5) and the P2-Phe carbonyl O atom of APE (3.2 \u00c5) (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The configurations of the C2 and C3 atoms are inverted from S,S to R,R. The conversion at the C3 atom is due to the formation of this new covalent bond, whereas that at the C2 atom is a result of the change in the ranking order of substituents (Figure 5(d)). Asn142 and Cys145 of the peptidase flank a short loop constituting the oxyanion hole, with the amide hydrogen atoms of Gly143 and Cys145 as the hydrogen-bond donors to stabilize the carbonyl O atom in the scissile peptide group of the substrate. The conformation of this loop remains essentially unchanged upon the binding of APE. The P1-AGln carbonyl O atom of APE is accommodated in the oxyanion hole of the peptidase, accepting hydrogen bonds from the amide hydrogen atoms of Gly143 and Cys145 at distances of 2.7 \u00c5 and 3.4 \u00c5, respectively (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The P1-AGln N\u03b1 atom of APE remains sp2-hybridized and adopts trigonal planar geometry. For P1-AGln, the equivalent to \u03d5, C(P2-Phe)-N(P1-AGln)-N\u03b1(P1-AGln)-C(P1-AGln), is \u221284.8\u00b0 (Figure 5(a)), and the equivalent to \u03c8, N(P1-AGln)-N\u03b1(P1-AGln)-C(P1-AGln)-C3(epoxide), is \u22127.3\u00b0 (Figure 5(b)). With the error in atomic coordinates considered, the trigonal plane centered at the P1-AGln N\u03b1 atom is coplanar with that centered at the P1-AGln carbonyl C atom, allowing the N\u03b1 atom to reduce the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom by \u03c0-electron delocalization. The equivalent to \u03c71 of P1-AGln, N-N\u03b1-C\u03b2-C\u03b3, is \u221277.4\u00b0.",

This residue is at the tip of the N-finger (N-terminal residues 1 to 7) propagating between the domain III of its parent protomer and the domain II of the partner protomer. In the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex, the Ser1 amino group of each protomer forms an ionic interaction with the Glu166 side-chain carboxyl group of the other protomer (2.7 \u00c5). The Ser1 of each protomer also interacts with the Phe140 of the other protomer through amide hydrogen\u2013carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonding (3.2 \u00c5). These three residues are thus held together to form the \u201cfloor\u201d of the S1 specificity pocket (Figure 6\n(a)). In both protomers of the M+A(\u22121)pro:APE complex, however, Ser1 is N-terminally blocked by the additional Ala, and the ionic interaction between the Ser1 amino group and Glu166 side-chain carboxyl group is lost. This is also followed by the loss of the amide hydrogen\u2013carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bond between Ser1 and Phe140 because Ser1 is no longer properly oriented. The additional Ala is disordered, leaving Ser1 unanchored and the floor of the S1 specificity pocket partly disrupted (Figure 6(b)). Despite the disruption of the S1 pocket by the presence of a single additional N-terminal residue, the presence of a ten-residue affinity tag at the N terminus of Mpro reduced the specific activity of the peptidase by less than an order of magnitude (results not shown).",

In the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex, the crystallographic 2-fold axis passes through the dimer interface and brings the opposite interacting residue-pairs into exact 2-fold symmetry (Figure 2); whereas in the structure of the M+A(\u22121)pro:APE complex, even in the absence of a crystallographic 2-fold axis, the dimer interface still exhibits approximate 2-fold symmetry.

The majority of the interactions occur between the residues on the N-finger and domain II. Two ionic interactions, one between the Ser1 amino group and the Glu166 side-chain carboxyl group of opposite protomers, and one between the side-chains of the Arg4 and Glu290 of opposite protomers, are observed in the structures of unbound Mpro and the M+A(\u22121)pro:APE complex (Figure 6(a)).

The structure of the Mpro:CMK complex previously determined in the space group P21 shows different and unexpected modes of binding for CMK to the two protomers of the peptidase.13 CMKs are highly active alkylating agents and react with good nucleophiles, such as hydroxyl and thiol groups. They therefore inhibit serine peptidases as well as cysteine peptidases.28 A recent study showed that CMKs efficiently inhibit some clan CA cysteine peptidases, such as papain and the cathepsins.30 This casts doubt on the utility of CMKs as specific inhibitors for Mpro. In contrast, the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex show that the aza-peptide component of APE binds to the peptidase in a substrate-like manner. The main-chain of the aza-peptide component of APE forms amide hydrogen\u2013carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues 164 to 166 of the peptidase in the manner of an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet. The P1 and P2 side-chains of APE occupy the S1 and S2 specificity pockets of the peptidase, respectively. Based on the definitions for the binding of epoxysuccinyl peptides to clan CA cysteine peptidases,28 this corresponds to the S and S\u2032 binding mode, with inclination to the S binding mode because the pre-cleavage portion of the substrate-binding region of the peptidase makes the major contribution to Mpro:APE interactions.",

            "text": "The kinetic data and crystal structures indicate that Mpro reacts only with the S,S diastereomer of the APE and not its R,R diastereomer. Interestingly, the order of inhibitory activities for APEs towards most clan CD cysteine peptidases is S,S>R,R>trans>cis (the racemic mixture of the S,R and R,S diastereomers).24, 26, 27 Based on the Mpro:APE structures, we built models of each of the four diastereomers of APE at the active site of Mpro to explain the results of our trials (Figure 7\n(a) to (d)). These models show that, for APE to be accommodated in the substrate-binding regions of the peptidase, the epoxide C3 atom of APE must be in the S configuration, otherwise the epoxide moiety sterically clashes with the \u201cback-wall\u201d of the active site of the peptidase and with the aza-peptide component of APE itself (Figure 7(b) and (c)). In the S configuration, the epoxide C3 atom of APE is also in better geometry with respect to the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom for the nucleophilic attack. The epoxide C2 atom of APE must be in the S configuration as well to allow the interactions between the epoxide moiety and the active site of the peptidase, otherwise the epoxide moiety sterically clashes with the loop constituting the oxyanion hole of the peptidase (Figure 7(d)). The model with the S,S diastereomer of APE also indicates that the distance between the His41 N\u03b52 atom of the peptidase and the epoxide O atom is 4 \u00c5 to 5 \u00c5, and that these two atoms are not well aligned for proton transfer (Figure 7(a)). This suggests that the opening of the epoxide ring likely involves two steps separated by a conformational rearrangement of APE: (1) the protonation of the epoxide O atom and (2) the nucleophilic attack at the epoxide C3 atom. From the model, it is not possible to determine the order in which these steps occur. However, it would be energetically more favorable for protonation to be the first step. On the other hand, Mpro may be sufficiently flexible in solution to allow the alignment of the His41 N\u03b52 atom and the epoxide O atom for proton transfer. In such a scenario, protonation and nucleophilic attack could occur in a concerted manner, enabling the epoxide ring to open in a single step. Much of the mechanism for the inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro by APE remains to be elucidated. Rigorous treatment of this issue using methodologies in organic chemistry will be required.",

Despite the appreciable participation by the N-fingers in dimer interactions, it was shown experimentally that the deletion of the N-fingers inactivates the peptidase but has little effect on its dimerization properties. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that the main role of the N-finger is one directing the peptidase to dimerize at an orientation facilitating the formation of substrate-binding regions in the catalytically competent conformation.10 This very likely relies on the two ionic interactions observed in the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex, one between the protonated amino group of Ser1 and the Glu166 side-chain carboxyl group of opposite protomers, and one between the side-chains of the Arg4 and Glu290 of opposite protomers. In the structure of the M+A(\u22121)pro:APE complex, the former ion-pair does not exist but both substrate-binding regions are still capable of accommodating APE in a manner similar to that exhibited by the structure of the Mpro:APE complex. This suggests that the former ionic interaction, possibly because it is relatively accessible to the solvent and therefore weaker, is of less importance.",

Based on this trend, a pH-triggered switch for the catalytic activity of the peptidase was proposed.13 In our study, all crystals were grown at pH 6.5 and the resulting structures show that the substrate-binding regions of both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation. This suggests the possibility of an alternative or additional mechanism underlying the pH-dependence of the activity of the peptidase, especially at pH 6.5 or above. The change in protonation/deprotonation state of the catalytic dyad with pH is one of the possible second mechanisms. Insights into this possibility could be provided by the direct determinations of the pK\na values of the catalytic dyad by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as exemplified by the similar studies of the catalytic triad of \u03b1-lytic peptidase.33\n",

All crystals were grown at ambient temperature by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method. For the C2 crystals, the reservoir solution contained 50 mM ammonium acetate, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (M\nr 10,000), 3% ethylene glycol, 3% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1 mM Mes (pH 6.5). The drop contained equal amounts of the Mpro solution and the reservoir solution. Block-shaped crystals grew in two to three days to a size of about 0.1 mm\u00d70.1 mm\u00d70.1 mm. For the P212121 crystals, the reservoir solution had essentially the same composition as that for the C2 crystals, except the replacement of 5% polyethylene glycol (M\nr 10,000) and 3% dimethyl sulfoxide by 6% polyethylene glycol (M\nr 8000). The drop contained equal amounts of the M+A(\u22121)pro solution and the reservoir solution. Needle-shaped crystals grew in three to five days to a size of about 0.05 mm\u00d70.05 mm\u00d70.5 mm. Crystals of good quality were selected and soaked overnight in drops with the same compositions as their reservoir solutions plus the APE chosen for this study at 3 mM. Cryo-protectants had essentially the same compositions as reservoir solutions, except for the inclusion of 25% (v/v) glycerol in the case of the C2 crystals and the increase of ethylene glycol to 25% in the case of the P212121 crystals. Crystals were briefly soaked and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage and shipment to the synchrotron beamline.",
