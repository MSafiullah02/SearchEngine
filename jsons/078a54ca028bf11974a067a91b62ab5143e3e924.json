            "text": "We present the first comparative analysis of virulence across all known human RNA virus 1 7 8 species to our knowledge. We find that disease severity is non-randomly distributed across 1 7 9 virus families and that beyond taxonomy, severe disease is predicted by risk factors of tissue tissues that do not contribute to transmission [28] . Furthermore, the evolutionary determinants of tissue tropism themselves are not well understood [29] . Tissue tropism should be a key 1 9 7 consideration for future comparative and evolutionary modelling efforts. We also found viruses primarily transmitted by direct contact and respiratory routes to have a 2 0 0 higher predicted probability of severe virulence than viruses transmitted by more indirect via an indirect route such as through an arthropod vector, virulence could bring ultimate 2 0 7 fitness costs due to host mortality before encountering a vector, fomite, etc.. The relationship between virulence and transmissibility appears more complex. Firstly, the human-to-human transmissibility (level 4) (Fig 5) . This would lend support towards disease for a specific subset of four viruses in the single classification tree (Fig 2) 'dead-end' infections) have been predicted to result in higher virulence as without any 2 2 5 evolutionary selection, viral phenotypes within that host will be non-adapted, i.e. a 2 2 6 'coincidental' by-product [24, 25] . However, we did not observe viruses incapable of human-to-2 2 7 human transmissibility to be more virulent, the highest risk instead being observed for viruses dead-end infections, ultimate levels of virulence could also feasibly turn out to be 2 3 0 'coincidentally' low. Taxonomic family being a highly informative predictor in the random forest implies that there 2 3 3 is a broad phylogenetic signal to virulence, but it is also highly likely that the explanatory 2 3 4 power represents a proxy for many other phylogenetically-conserved viral traits that are 2 3 5 challenging to implement in comparative analyses of this scale, such as variation at the 2 3 6 proteomic, transcriptomic or genomic level; or further data beyond simple categorisations, e.g. specific arthropod vector species. Untangling these sources of variation from different scales 2 3 8 of traits will be a critical next step in predictive modelling of viral virulence. We acknowledge several limitations to the quality of our data, as with any broad comparative analysis. Risk factor data was problematic or missing for certain viruses, e.g. natural Virulence also exhibits substantial variation at the sub-species level, i.e. between strains or and geography, though this appears to be driven by variation between genotypes [30]. Confirmatory analyses at a finer resolution would validate our identified risk factors, e.g. broadest level, though caution must be exerted in extrapolating the risk factors we find to 2 5 7 dynamics of specific infections.

We rated viruses as 'severe' if they firstly had \u2265 5% CFR where 3 1 8 data was available (159/214 viruses including those with zero CFR), otherwise, we rated viruses as 'severe' if they had frequent reports of hospitalisation, were associated with 3 2 0 significant morbidity from certain conditions (haemorrhagic fever, seizures/coma, cirrhosis, 3 2 1 AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, HTLV-associated myelopathy) or were explicitly 3 2 2 described as \"severe\" or \"causing severe disease\" (S1 Table, S2 Table) .
