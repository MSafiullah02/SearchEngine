According the data from the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 9th, April, 2020 this pandemic has infected 1395136 and totally killed 81580 infected1. Knowing from the work of W. Guan, et al., 637 from 1096 infectors, 58.1 percent, is male2. More importantly, a great number of these suffers are in the childbearing age. Thus, it is a significant question on the table that whether SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, could attack the testis.",

Except expression in the lung, ACE2 extensively expresses in alimentary canal, kidney and heart, and the Spermatogonia, Sertoli, Leydig cell in testis also rich in ACE2 expression4\n,\n5. It is not hard for people to conjecture that testis may be infected by this virus, which further leads to some reproductive problems. As revealed in a single-center study, the serum sex-related hormones ratio of testosterone (T) to luteinizing hormone (LH) and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH, to some extent represent reproductive ability, has a significant discrepancy between infectors and healthy control6. The cases of secondary infection also stand a warning sign that testis is the potential hotbed for SARS-COV-2. However, a latest semen and testis biopsy showed a non-positive result of virus determined by RT-PCR test, though the case was limited and without histopathology and RT-PCR may meet a false negative when applied to detected the virus sequence7. These confusing results guide us into the \u201cSARS-CoV-2 and testis damage\u201d maze.",

Remarkably, a series of studies of autopsy have indicated that SARS causes orchitis characterized by widespread germ cell destruction, few or no spermatozoon in the seminiferous tubule, thickened basement membrane, and leukocyte infiltration. However, SARS virus sequence was not detected in testis by in situ hybridization. The precipitation of IgG in the seminiferous epithelium of SARS testis reflected dramatically immune response8\n,\n9.
