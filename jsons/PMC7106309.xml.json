The conserved regions were identified by aligning 253 sequences available in the GenBank database. The RT-iiPCR reaction conditions, such as concentrations of primers and probe, Taq DNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase, were tested systematically to obtain the highest sensitivity and specificity. Following optimization of the RT-iiPCR assay conditions, the reagents including primers and probe were lyophilized (proprietary) and used in this study. Briefly, the lyophilized premix was reconstituted in 50 \u03bcL of Premix Buffer B (GeneReach USA), and then 5 \u03bcL of the test nucleic acid extract was added. A 50-\u03bcL volume of the premix/sample mixture was transferred into a labeled R-tube, which was subsequently sealed with a cap, spun briefly in a microcentrifuge (Cubee; GeneReach USA), and placed into the POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer. The default program, including a reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 10 minutes and an iiPCR step at 95\u00b0C for about 30 minutes, was completed in less than 1 hour.

The results were shown on the display screen at the end of the program. A \u201c?\u201d indicated that the results were ambiguous and the sample should be tested again.",

These samples were confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV infection by the real-time RT-qPCR assay routinely used at the KCDC laboratory during the outbreak in Korea in 2015. To estimate the diagnostic performance of the singleplex RT-iiPCR methods, the assay results were compared with the reference singleplex RT-qPCR assays that were run side-by-side (ie, the reference RT-qPCR assays were repeated with the newly extracted RNA from sputum samples).33 The results from the initial laboratory testing together with those from the RT-iiPCR and RT-qPCR assays using the clinical specimens are shown in Table 4\n. The ORF1a RT-iiPCR assay was able to detect MERS-CoV RNA in 54 of 55 positively confirmed samples, whereas the reference ORF1a RT-qPCR assay positively detected 52 of 55. Meanwhile, the upE RT-iiPCR assay positively detected all 55 samples, whereas the reference upE RT-qPCR assay confirmed 54 of 55 positive samples (Table 4). Specifically, the previously positive specimen from patient ID P085 (collected 06-14-2015) was tested as negative with ORF1a RT-iiPCR and reference singleplex ORF1a and upE RT-qPCR assays. The upE RT-iiPCR was the only assay that identified the P085 specimen as positive. Two positive samples from patients ID P130 (collected 06-14-2015) and ID P148 (collected 06-21-2015) were tested as false negatives by the reference ORF1a RT-qPCR, resulting in detection of 52 of 55 positive samples (Table 4). Thus, by comparing the RT-iiPCR results to those from the initial laboratory testing at the time of the outbreak, the sensitivities of the singleplex MERS-CoV ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR assays were 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%\u2013100%) and 100% (55 of 55; 95% CI, 97.43%\u2013100%), respectively, whereas those of the reference RT-qPCR were 97.09% (52 of 55; 95% CI, 87.43%\u2013100%) for ORF1a and 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%\u2013100%) for upE, respectively (Table 4).",

            "text": "The singleplex ORF1a and upE MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR assays described in this study are performed in commercially available, simple, and compact instruments, the POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer series, which can process 4 to 32 samples at a time within an hour. The automated interpretation by the iiPCR machine makes the method easier because it does not require data analysis by the user. Furthermore, the ready-to-use lyophilized amplification reagents that are stable for at least 2 years at 4\u00b0C provide great ease of storage and transportation. Removal of contaminating PCR inhibitors and genomic DNA during nucleic acid extraction is critical to avoid false negative and positive results, respectively.40 Thus, optimal RNA extraction and template preparation is key for obtaining the highest sensitivity and specificity of any molecular diagnostic assay including RT-iiPCR. Automatic or semiautomatic nucleic acid extraction methods only require basic laboratory training skills and minimize the hands-on time required for template preparation before assembling the reaction. Furthermore, the clinical samples are directly added to the lysis buffer, which immediately inactivates the pathogen and, thus, reduces the risk of exposure of the personnel handling the clinical material. However, it is important to use appropriate personal protective wear and follow recommended biosecurity guidelines during handling and testing of the clinical specimens. Utilization of a light-weight, field-deployable automatic nucleic acid extraction device (taco mini Nucleic Acid Automatic Extraction System; GeneReach USA) along with the iiPCR/POCKIT system greatly reduces the hands-on time from sample collection to results (Figure 1\n). These instruments also can be connected to a car battery and are designed as a portable system to be used in clinics, hospitals, farms, and public health laboratories in remote areas without electricity. Taking advantage of this platform, the two MERS-CoV singleplex RT-iiPCR methods targeting either the ORF1a or upE gene were established to aid rapid on-site diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Multiple RT-qPCR assays targeting different sequences in the MERS-CoV genome have been recommended to be used as sequential primary and confirmatory tests to help reduce the risks of misidentifying MERS-CoV cases.34 Particularly, the upE assay has been recommended for screening purposes, whereas the ORF1a assay for confirmation.8 Both ORF1a- and upE-specific RT-iiPCR assays described in this study were shown to be analytically sensitive, and no cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses such as the hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43 strains.",

            "text": "Lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum and tracheal aspirates are the recommended sample types for accurate diagnosis because they are known to contain high viral RNA loads that persist longer compared with other sample types tested.41 Therefore, the detection limit of singleplex ORF1a and upE MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR assays were compared with the corresponding WHO-recommended reference singleplex RT-qPCR assays using RNA extracted from infectious TCF or human sputum samples spiked with serially diluted MERS-CoV and assessed the assay performance. The data showed that the singleplex ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR and the corresponding singleplex reference RT-qPCR assays were able to detect as low as <10 copies/\u03bcL of synthetic RNA and 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22121 PFU/mL of infectious TCF. Similar results were obtained when analytical sensitivities of ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR assays were evaluated using sputum samples spiked with a MERS-CoV isolate. Furthermore, the clinical sensitivity and specificity of both singleplex MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR assays were evaluated using archived sputum samples collected from confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection during the Korean outbreak in 2015. To estimate the diagnostic performance, the singleplex RT-iiPCR assay results were compared side by side with the reference singleplex RT-qPCR assay. The data indicated that the sensitivities of the singleplex MERS-CoV ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR assays were 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%\u2013100%) and 100% (55 of 55; 95% CI, 97.43%\u2013100%), respectively, whereas those of the reference RT-qPCR assays were 97.09% (52 of 55; 95% CI, 87.43%\u2013100%) for ORF1a and 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%\u2013100%) for upE. Possible explanation for the discrepancy with initial diagnosis seen in two specimens (P085 [06-14-2015] and P130 [06-14-2015]) could be viral RNA degradation during long-term storage. The viral RNA copy number of false-negative samples was below detection limit in both assays (assessed by reference RT-qPCR <10 copies), whereas the CT value of internal amplification control remained moderately low (RNase P CT 27.3 and 30.2, respectively), indicating the possibility of viral RNA loss during storage and/or the extraction process. Moreover, in a number of specimens tested, the overall estimated viral load detected during our study was lower compared with the viral copy number estimated a year earlier (data not shown). These observations suggest that the sensitivity of the assay can be adversely affected by the collection method and storage of clinical specimens. In the case of the specimen from patient ID P148 (collected 06-21-2015) that was tested as false negative by the reference ORF1a RT-qPCR assay, it could potentially be due to the presence of extremely low concentrations of target RNA. The RNA levels of the internal amplification control in this sample (RNase P CT 38.5) were the lowest compared with the rest of the samples, suggesting relatively low RNA extraction levels. Nevertheless, the data presented in this study demonstrate that the performance of both singleplex ORF1a and upE MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR tests is equivalent or higher compared with the reference singleplex RT-qPCR tests and provides much faster results (within an hour).",
