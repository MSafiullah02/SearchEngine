Furthermore, it is unclear whether the RV types involved with bronchiolitis have different risks associated with the later development of asthma.",

Our study hypothesis was that RV-A or RV-C etiology of severe bronchiolitis is associated with increased need for the long-term asthma control medication.",

The children were recruited from the pediatric wards or intensive care units of Kuopio, Tampere, and Turku University Hospitals in Finland during the winter seasons 2008 to 2010 (from November 1 until March 31).23 The children were hospitalized for bronchiolitis and were younger than 24 months on admission. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis was clinical and made according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines including children with acute respiratory illness with some combination of rhinitis, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, crackles, and/or retractions.1 No initial exclusions were made on the basis of history of wheezing or use of asthma medication before hospitalization. In addition, we identified a subgroup of 204 infants who were younger than 12 months with no history of wheezing (strict bronchiolitis criteria).24, 25 The exclusion criteria were previous enrollment or transfer to a participating hospital more than 48 hours after the original admission time. Because all the children were hospitalized, they were defined as having a severe bronchiolitis. The Institutional Ethical Board of Turku University Hospital approved the study. The institutional ethical boards of other participating hospitals confirmed this approval. The parents or guardians gave written informed consent to the study.",

If the parents did not respond within 6 months, participants were contacted by telephone and interviewed.

The inflammatory response caused by different RVs might damage the airways, although RSV could cause even more structural damage to airway epithelium than RV.11 However, changes in epithelial barrier function even before the infection can increase the risk of severe RV bronchiolitis, and host factors such as atopy and low IFN responses could have additive effects. In addition, risk genes such as cadherin-related family member 3 (encoding a receptor for RV-C) and 17q21 can predispose children to more severe RV-C infections and development of asthma.8, 11, 21, 22, 31 Finally, RV infection can inhibit IFN responses and potentiate TH2-cell\u2013driven inflammation and production of cytokines, which promote airway obstruction and wheeze.10 Atopic characteristics are not seen as a risk factor for RSV-induced wheezing and asthma, which is more linked to young age and low lung function, indicating that the timing of RSV infection may be important for the future development of respiratory illnesses.11 Similarly, genetic factors can modify the risk of RSV bronchiolitis and development of asthma.10\n",

Data from these studies suggest that atopic airways are more likely to develop obstructive changes after RV-related wheeze. Also, severe febrile viral respiratory infections in infancy and early atopy are known risk factors for persistent wheeze and asthma.35 Similarly, in our study, the occurrence of RV-C bronchiolitis, atopic dermatitis, and fever together was an especially important marker of risk for wheeze and asthma later in childhood.",
