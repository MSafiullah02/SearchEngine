As people are repeatedly exposed, through personal experiences and media consumption, to anxiety-provoking topics related to this growing health crisis, it is vital for health professionals, researchers, and policy makers to be able to recognize the clinical signs of dysfunctional thought processes related to the COVID-19 crisis. A reasonable level of attention and reflection on COVID-19 information can help people stay safe during the crisis, but too much disturbing thinking about this infectious disease can be debilitating and unhealthy (Taylor, 2019) .",

From a psychometric perspective, too much COVID-19 thinking means scores greater than or equal to 7 on the OCS. From a practical perspective, too much COVID-19 thinking roughly corresponds to spending at least three to seven days, dreaming about the coronavirus, repetitively thinking about the coronavirus, having disturbing thoughts that one has caught the coronavirus, and having disturbing thoughts that one saw particular people who may have the coronavirus. Although these cognitive processes are derived from a biologically evolved defense system designed to keep a person safe from harm (Ohman, 2000) , these kinds of persistent and distressing thought patterns are common symptoms of clinical anxiety (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Moreover, these thought patterns were shown to be maladaptive in this study, as they were not only tied to functional impairment, but were also found to be associated with a host of issues, ranging from drugs/alcohol coping to thoughts of suicide. Therefore, health professionals, researchers, and policy makers would be well advised to recognize this form of COVID-19 related thinking.",
