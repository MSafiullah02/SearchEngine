When the COVID-19 virus originated and became epidemic in Wuhan, China in 2019, Taiwan, because of its close geographic proximity to China, was expected to have the second highest number of cases. 1 However, Taiwan was successful in preventing this occurrence by deploying a combination of big data, transparency, and central command. 2 These measures, while strict, were combined with a high degree of sensitive and professional nursing care provided by front line nurses. Immediately after COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China before the Lunar New Year, nursing leaders of government, national nursing organizations, and hospitals, together with the Taiwanese government, quickly mobilized resources to protect nurses on the frontlines, to implement approaches to provide skilled nursing care in infection control units and negative-pressure wards, and to protect public health, The experiences and actions 2 taken by nurses in Taiwan can provide valuable information for other countries in their response to COVID-19.",

At the beginning of the outbreak, the government educated the public about the appropriate timing of wearing masks. The government has been buying all domestic mask production and rationing purchases to three masks per person per week to ensure that the supply to nurses and other front line health workers is top priority.",

By merging databases they can collect information on every citizen's 14-day travel history and ask those who visited high-risk areas to self-quarantine. Mobile phones are tracked to ensure people stayed at home. People receive a text warning if they have gone too far from the accommodation and will be fined if they do not return immediately. Using phone tracking to enforce mandatory quarantine is one example of how Taiwan has managed to contain the spread of coronavirus. In addition to the strict measure, it is important to follow up with those people under self-quarantine about their mental and physical health and to provide immediate support or referrals. This is also imperative to ensure people under self-quarantine follow the guidelines and practice appropriate infection control measures to prevent spread of virus. So far, the nurse-led quarantine care call center has reached out to more than 30,000 cases and has identified important issues to be addressed and has made almost 4,000 referrals in order to early diagnose or provide timely management of symptoms.",

These expert nurses have also served as important mentors and consultants to the public and other hospitals during the COVID epidemic. The Taiwan Nurses Association has taken an initiative to ask nurses in these designated hospitals to produce videos to educate nurses and the public about infection control measures and about provision of care to infected or suspected patients through on line platforms and social media. The Taiwan Union of Nurses Association and the Taiwan Nurses Association have jointly published an article on social media calling for the public to practice social distancing and to cancel large events. In February, the organizer of DaJia Mazu Pilgrimage, the largest cultural event in Taiwan, annually attracting hundreds of thousands of people, announced the event would go on as scheduled. The two nursing associations jointly urged the organizer to call off the event in order to decrease the spread of virus, and the event was postponed.Nursing leaders are vigilant about taking steps to prevent a nursing shortage if a large volume of patients is admitted into hospitals. As the outbreak was beginning in China, the Department of Nursing and Health Care issued a call back for nurses who were not currently practicing. A large number of nurses responded and indicated their wishes to return to workforce if there is a shortage of manpower.",
