            "text": "An association between the development of asthma in childhood and viral respiratory tract infections has been recognized for several decades. Acute viral infections are important triggers of wheezing in children and asthma exacerbation in both children and adults. 7, 16, 55 Using polymerase chain reaction-based methods of detection, recent studies found that more than 80% of wheezing episodes in school children were associated with viral respiratory tract infections.40 In more than 60% of these patients, rhinovirus (RV) was detected.41 In infants and toddlers under the age of 2 years, the virus most frequently isolated during wheezing episodes is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 39, 52 Parainfluenza viruses (PIV), corona virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and enteroviruses have all been implicated in the development or exacerbation of wheezing. 39, 57 Some of the epidemiologic evidence suggests that respiratory viruses may both trigger asthma exacerbation and contribute to the enhancement of allergic sensitization and subsequent development of allergic asthma. An association between viral respiratory tract infections and the onset of allergic sensitization in children born into allergic families has been proposed.27\n",

By the age of 7 years, asthma was still more prevalent in the group of children who had RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life than in the control population.71 Some studies indicate that RSV bronchiolitis at an early age results in bronchial hyperreactivity persisting for more than 10 years62 and may even be associated with chronic pulmonary disease persisting into adulthood. 3, 4 A criticism of these epidemiologic studies has been that by selecting children with RSV disease severe enough to require hospitalization, the selection might also favor those with an atopic predisposition or intrinsic abnormalities of airway function. Further, a number of observations indicate that atopy may alter the response to respiratory viral infections, resulting in more severe disease. 18, 51 An atopic predisposition may not be required for the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness following RSV bronchiolitis, however. 73, 74, 82, 83\n",

In this group of transient wheezers, no significant association with allergic sensitization was detected, but reduced airway function, indicated by a low Vmax forced residual capacity measured before the first viral respiratory infection was a significant risk factor for the development of wheezing. 48, 49, 51 For these children, who may have smaller airways than children who never wheeze, wheezing in the first 3 years of life seems to be a self-limiting condition, without long-term sequelae. In a substantial minority who were \u201cpersistent wheezers\u201d\u2014i.e., children who developed wheezing in the first 3 years of life that persisted beyond the age of 6 years, wheezing was associated with allergic sensitization and a history of maternal asthma.51 These children also had elevated serum levels of total immunoglobulin (Ig)E during the acute phase of their first lower respiratory tract infection as well as eosinophilia in the peripheral blood, in contrast to transient wheezers and children without asthmatic symptoms during acute infection.50 Furthermore, these children demonstrated reduced airway function at the age of 6 years, having had normal lung function after birth. At the age of 11 years, this group showed similar characteristics.77\n",

Interestingly, this risk diminished with age and was not significant by 13 years of age.78 Furthermore, the rate of allergic sensitization did not differ between children with or without respiratory tract infection at any age78 and the authors concluded that RSV infection was not associated with allergic sensitization and that both atopy and RSV infection are independent risk factors for the development of asthma.

The sum of the epidemiologic data available indicates that viral respiratory tract infections in the very young may cause transient asthmatic symptoms or may trigger the early development of asthma in children with a genetic predisposition to atopy, rather than inducing allergic sensitization in and of itself. This raises the possibility of synergistic interactions between respiratory tract viral infections, predisposition to atopy, and sensitization to aero-allergens, resulting in the development of persistent airway inflammation and asthma. Such interactions have been demonstrated in children presenting to an emergency room, where the combination of atopy and concurrent respiratory tract viral illness was associated with the greatest risk for asthma symptoms.18 Overall, the relationships between viral respiratory infections and development of persistent wheezing or asthma are complex and still ill-defined. Nonetheless, the prevailing view is that viral infections, including RSV, are not a major factor in the induction of atopic asthma.",

Development of allergic asthma reflects the interplay between strong genetic predisposition and the development of an airway inflammatory response following allergen or other exposures, most often characterized by infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils. The consequence of a respiratory virus infection may be dictated by the host's immune response to the virus; in most cases, this response results in the relatively rapid curtailment of the infection. In some individuals, however, the response to infection results in exacerbation of underlying changes in airway function, resulting in more persistent wheezing. Investigations in human and animal models have revealed possible clues to pathogenesis, some of which have been reviewed recently. 23, 56, 81 Respiratory viruses, especially RSV, often initially infect the respiratory epithelium of the upper airways but the infection can spread to the lower airways. Following RSV bronchiolitis, viral antigen can be detected in the bronchioles.54 Rodent and other animal models also show evidence of lower airway infection. 43, 61 Rhinovirus, the classical cold virus, which was thought to infect upper airways exclusively, also is capable of infecting the lower airways. Rhinovirus mRNA has been detected in cell pellets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following experimental RV16 infection.34\n",

The resulting blockade interrupts an inhibitory feedback mechanism, resulting in increased release of acetylcholine and in increased airway muscle tone and reactivity. This mechanism has been demonstrated both in models of allergic sensitization and following acute viral infection. 29, 30, 31 Parainfluenza virus neuraminidase can also bind to M2 muscarinic receptors directly and may be responsible for the effects described in the absence of eosinophilic inflammation.28 In addition, viral infection and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 downregulate M2-receptor gene expression.38\n",

Viral infection of respiratory epithelium results in reduced nitric oxide production associated with AHR in guinea pigs.24 Nitric oxide is the putative bronchodilator agonist of the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory (NANCi) system. This system can be defective during and following respiratory viral infection, resulting in AHR, demonstrated in RSV infection of cotton rats.11 A reduced barrier function of the respiratory epithelium may expose sensory C fibers to enhanced stimulation. This results in release of neuropeptides such as substance P and neurokinin A, both agonists of the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic, activating system59 and induces a brainstem reflex, 23 leading to bronchoconstriction. Neuropeptides can also contribute to airway obstruction by causing increased leukotriene synthesis, 85 release of mast cell mediators, 13, 42 and increased mucous secretion.12 In addition, infected epithelial cells produce smaller amounts of neutral endopeptidase, an enzyme that degrades neuropeptides. 5, 19, 37, 47 The role of sensory C fibers in virus-induced asthma exacerbations in humans remains controversial. Bradykinin provocation following experimental RV16 infection in mild asthmatics did not result in increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness.36 Bradykinin is a strong stimulator of sensory C fibers and would be expected to cause increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness if this system plays a major part in virus-induced asthma.",

Some of the pathologic changes may simply persist for long periods after the acute infection. A defect in NANCi function has been demonstrated to last for up to 24 weeks following RSV infection in ferrets.10 Persistence of infection, resulting in chronic alterations of epithelial cell function and chronic inflammation, has also been suggested. This hypothesis is supported by findings in guinea pigs and calves, in which RSV antigen can be detected in the lung 6 and 12 weeks after resolution of the infection. 65, 79 In guinea pigs, this persistence is associated with persistent AHR. Respiratory syncytial nucleic acid is also detectable in postmortem lung tissue from infants who died long after an RSV epidemic, supporting the possibility of virus persistence.15\n",

In these experimental approaches, enhanced allergic sensitization was thought to be caused by increased allergen uptake across inflamed mucous membranes. Indeed, in both a guinea pig and a mouse model, exposure to ovalbumin aerosol caused increased levels of serum ovalbumin if administered during acute virus infection. 26, 63\n",

This resulted in enhanced responses to allergen and, as a consequence, airway inflammation, with the influx of neutrophils and eosinophils. This was associated with altered airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine. In contrast to many of the models discussed previously, allergen-specific IgE serum levels were not higher in the group that was infected with RSV prior to allergic sensitization. This may indicate that mechanisms other than increased allergen uptake are responsible for the effects of RSV infection on the subsequent consequences of exposure to allergen.

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections in early childhood have been linked to the development of persistent wheezing and asthma. Epidemiologic data indicate that, for the majority of children, virus-induced wheezing is a self-limited condition, with no long-term consequences. For a substantial minority, however, virus-induced wheezing is associated with persistent asthma and the potential for enhanced allergic sensitization. For the most part, this subset of patients is genetically predisposed; they are atopic children in whom respiratory viral infections trigger the early development of asthma by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. Both inflammatory and noninflammatory mechanisms may be involved. It does not appear that viral infection per se in early life is responsible for the induction of atopic asthma. Data from animal models provide support for the concept that enhanced allergic sensitization caused by increased uptake of allergen during infection may play a critical role, as well as T-cell\u2013mediated immune responses to viral infection, which may favor eosinophilic inflammatory responses and the development of altered airway function to inhaled methacholine. Recent advances in our understanding of the interactions between respiratory viruses and the development of reactive airway disease offer new possibilities for preventive treatment in children at risk for developing persistent wheezing and asthma exacerbation as a result of viral infection.",
