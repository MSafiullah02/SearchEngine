            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease of cats caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. There are two serotypes (Fiscus and Teramoto, 1987; Hohdatsu et al., 1991), type I being more prevalent in field conditions (Hohdatsu et al., 1992), accounting for at least 70% of FIP cases. However, to date, most vaccine attempts have been based on serotype II. Development of vaccines has been largely unsuccessful, with traditional approaches sometimes serving to exacerbate disease through antibody dependentenhancement (ADE). The identification of FCoV epitopes responsible for neutralisation and enhancement is still under investigation. Attempts at vaccination have included the use of avirulent FCoV (Pedersen and Black, 1983), recombinant vaccina virus expressing the S protein (Vennema et al., 1990), non-feline coronaviruses (Barlough et al., 1984, Barlough et al., 1985; Stoddart et al., 1988) and plasmids expressing M or N proteins alone, or with enhancement through vaccinia viruses or feline cytokines (Glansbeek et al., 2002). A commercial vaccine (Christianson et al., 1989) was launched in 1991 (Primucell-FIP\u2122, Pfizer Animal Health), however, its safety remains controversial and it is not licensed for kittens less than 16 weeks old (McArdle et al., 1995; Scott et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Generation of mucosal immunity may be critical to prevent FCoV infection and FIP. A strong cellular immune response, through the induction of type I immunity, appears to be the key to virus control (reviewed by Olsen, 1993). Minimisation of the development of humoral antibodies may be valuable in avoiding ADE of infection and immune complex deposition. Expression of serotype 1 FCoV epitopes that induce a protective response using a virus vector from a different family may provide a solution and would reduce the risk of virus recombination. Retroviral vectors may act as suitable candidates as they are persistent, integrating a proviral copy of their genome into the host DNA, from which protein expression occurs whenever transcription of that region is initiated. Spumaviruses offer several potential advantages over the more traditionally explored retroviral vectors. They have a large genome size; a wide cellular host range; are relatively apathogenic and require the presence of the viral transactivator (Tas) for high level transcription from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). The latter factor enables the development of replication-incompetence, as deletion of the transactivator prevents transcription of the structural genes. Supplying this protein in trans, via a helper cell line, allows the production of an infectious viral particle able to infect a susceptible cell and integrate. However, such an infection would be abortive, unable to produce infectious virions because of the lack of Tas in the target cell.",

The functionality of these plasmids was investigated through transfection assays and \u03b2-galactosidase staining. A cationic lipid-based transfection system (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen) was used to carry plasmid DNA into FKCU/LTR/zeo/\u03b2-gal reporter cells (a kind gift from Prof. A. Rethwilm, University of Wurzburg, Germany). These cells contain the lacZ gene under the control of the FFV LTR.

            "text": "Viral vectors have been developed for human gene therapy applications in recent years, though many current vehicles remain either inefficient or potentially unsafe. The unique biology of the foamy viruses lends themselves to development as such vectors, particularly their reported lack of pathogenicity. In humans, zoonotic infection with simian FV (SFV) has been reported and it is now thought that human FV (renamed prototypic (P)FV) was originally a zoonotic infection with SFVcpz(Herchenroder et al., 1994). SFV infection in man has been reported as apathogenic, in studies involving up to a 23-year monitoring period, and man appears to be a dead-end host (Heneine et al., 1998). Despite links to a number of diseases, including de Quervain thyroiditis (Werner and Gelderblom, 1979), Graves disease (Lagaye et al., 1992) and M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease (Pyykk\u00f6 et al., 1993), no studies have subsequently confirmed these associations (reviewed by Heneine et al., 2003). There have been reports of association of FFV with feline polyarthropathy (Pedersen et al., 1980) and a cofactor effect with FIV (Winkler et al., 1999; Zenger et al., 1993), but these reports have not been confirmed by other workers in the field and there is no convincing evidence of any direct pathology associated with infection. Studies have shown FFV to be relatively ubiquitous in the domestic and feral cat populations, with seroprevalences ranging from 5\u2013100%, with over 50% for most populations (Bandecchi et al., 1992; Flower et al., 1985;Winkler et al., 1997, Winkler et al., 1998, Winkler et al., 1999). It has been concluded from phylogenetic analyses that simian foamy viruses have a long history of coexistence and coevolution with their hosts (Herchenroderet al., 1994; Schweizer and Neumann-Haefelin, 1995) and this may apply to FFV and cats. Experimental infections in cats have provided no evidence of pathology or clinical signs of disease(Alke et al., 2000; Schwantes et al., 2002). Thus, although the issue of pathogenicity cannot be completely ruled out, most evidence suggests the virus is non-pathogenic. We are currently investigating the possibility of pathogenicity associated with FFV experimental infection of cats.",

Work to date has produced a functional, homogenous CRFK/tas helper cell line and current work is assessing the function of eGFP containing vectors. Preliminary results have indicated a failure of passage of the vectors, despite adequate transfection efficiencies. This could be due to a packaging problem, the 470 bp deleted tas fragment having been replaced with a 1.4 kb eGFP cassette. Alternatively, the disruption of Bet (a splice protein produced at high levels during viral replication, see Fig. 1), due to the tas deletion, may be responsible. Bet has been shown to be indispensable for in vitro FFV replication (Alke et al., 2001). Current studies are looking at supplying Bet in trans and reducing the foreign gene insert size to investigate these issues.",

On reverse transcription, the 5\u2032 U3 is restored, producing double stranded vector DNA that integrates, but as the virus is tas-deleted, there is no viral replication. Additional deletion of Tas responsive elements and the TATA box from the 3\u2032 U3 region eliminates the risk of activation of the FV U3 promoter by cellular components (Heinkeleinet al., 2002). Finally, minimal construct vectors have been produced using PFV, which depend on a co-transfection system to supply gag, pol and env in trans (Trobridge et al., 2002). FFV appears to be more difficult to manipulate than PFV in vector development, there being striking biological differences between the two viruses, particularly in the absolute requirement of Bet for FFV replication (Alke et al., 2001). However, FFV vectors are being developed, and have been applied recently in an experimental study looking at vaccination against feline calicivirus (Schwantes et al., 2003).",
