Components of the RNAi pathway serve multiple roles that can vary in different organisms. On the one hand, elements of the pathway participate in the innate immune response by recognizing and degrading long double\u2010stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) typically associated with viral infection (15\u201317). Simultaneously, the RNAi pathway has a recognized role in regulating host gene expression related to a myriad of cell functions by guiding the maturation and transcript targeting capabilities of a unique class of noncoding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs; refs. 18, 19). This aspect of RNAi is particularly intriguing given that some viruses, in particular herpesviruses, encode miRNAs that regulate host gene expression and, therefore, have a critical role in the dynamics of host\u2010pathogen interactions (20\u201322).",

In this regard, researchers have created entire libraries of gene\u2010specific targeting reagents that silence individual gene function by entering the pathway at one of two distinct positions. In one instance, synthetic dsRNA reagents referred to as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been generated. When introduced into cells, siRNAs associate with the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC), where the siRNA guide strand anneals to its complementary target mRNA (25, 26) and facilitates cleavage by Argonaute 2, a core endonuclease of RISC (Fig. 1). In an alternative approach, researchers have developed collections of gene\u2010targeting short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that can be generated from plasmid or viral expression constructs (27\u201329). Like their endogenous miRNA counterparts, shRNAs are expressed in the nucleus and are predicted to associate with RISC only after being processed by two separate endonucleases, Drosha and Dicer (Fig. 1 and refs. 18, 19).",

One potentially relevant consideration centers on activation of cellular immunity pathways. It is well documented that viral infection is monitored by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that trigger an innate immune response upon identifying an evolutionarily conserved pathogen\u2010associated molecular pattern (PAMP) (37). For example, recognition of influenza single\u2010stranded RNA genome by the endosomal PRR, Toll\u2010like receptor 7 (TLR7), leads to a strong antiviral cytokine response (38\u201340). Previous studies have also shown that transfection of short dsRNA (such as siRNA) can also perturb cellular immunity. For example, it has been demonstrated that siRNAs longer than ~ 23\u201025 bp strongly up\u2010regulate interferon (IFN)\u2010stimulated genes in HeLa cells (41). Other groups have shown that siRNAs can activate a type I interferon response, particularly through TLR7 and TLR8 (42, 43). Thus, if both siRNA and virus can independently stimulate TLR pathways, the question arises of how one can effectively screen for host genes that play a role in virus replication. One solution may lie in reagent selection. For example, while most siRNAs are designed to have complete complementarity to the target transcript, one design variable is duplex length. Previous studies have shown that in some cell types, short (19 bp) siRNAs effectively silence genes but are weaker activators of TLR signaling pathways (44). As such, under certain circumstances, these reagents can minimize the immune stimulatory effects that would otherwise complicate RNAi screens involving pathogens. In addition, several groups have demonstrated that modification of particular nucleotides with defined chemical groups (e.g., 2'\u2010O\u2010methyl,2'OMe) can greatly reduce the immunostimulatory effects of siRNA (45\u201347). Such modifications, which can act in either cis or trans, limit TLR7/8 activation and thereby prevent the triggering of downstream interferon and cytokine pathways.",

            "text": "Separately, another noteworthy caveat of all RNAi screening is siRNA specificity. Extensive studies have shown that in addition to targeting the mRNA of interest, siRNAs can act in a similar fashion to miRNAs and attenuate the translation of dozens of genes (48, 49). False positives (referred to as \u201coff\u2010targets\u201d) induced by this mechanism are frequently mediated by the seed region of the siRNA (nt 2\u20108), and may result in a 2\u2010 to 4\u2010fold down\u2010regulation of unintended targets (49). Notably, while off\u2010targets are generally thought to be genes encoded by the cell, in the case of RNAi screens designed to identify host\u2010pathogen interactions, off\u2010targets can also include genes encoded by the pathogen.",

For example, 2'\u2010O\u2010methyl modification of the second nucleotide of the siRNA antisense strand can greatly reduce seed\u2010mediated off\u2010target effects (50). Use of these reagents during primary screening can minimize the number of false positives and thereby reduce the time and costs associated with downstream validation. Alternatively, in cases where pools of siRNA were used in the primary screen, deconvolution of the pools and demonstration that multiple individual siRNAs (having different seed sequences) give the same phenotype increases the level of confidence that the phenotype is related to the knockdown of the targeted gene. Lastly, bioinformatics can be effectively used to identify off\u2010target effects. Cross\u2010checking the seed sequence of siRNAs that induce a phenotype with the seeds of known miRNAs (host and pathogen) can often identify instances in which one or more siRNAs are mimicking a miRNA. Although these hits should not be excluded from further study (due to potentially interesting host miRNA\u2010pathogen interactions), they may indicate that the observed phenotypes are the result of events unrelated to the knockdown of the intended target gene.",

In most cases, shRNAs are generated from DNA\u2010based expression constructs, and the predominant collections of shRNA libraries use either lentiviral or retroviral delivery systems to facilitate the entry and integration of the cassette into the host genome (27, 28). Previous genome profiling studies of lentiviral (HIV)\u2010infected CD4+ T cells have shown that infection leads to differential expression of multiple gene categories, including those related to complement activation, actin filaments, and proteasome cores (51). Thus, although the current shRNA platforms are essential for performing host\u2010pathogen studies in cases where the cell type of choice is refractory to lipid\u2010mediated transfection or an extended period of gene knockdown is required, one must consider the potential contributions that the delivery platform has on the outcome of host\u2010pathogen screens.",

In contrast, miRNA inhibitors are designed against mature miRNAs and can act as artificial targets to prevent the endogenous miRNA from interacting with its natural targets (60). A library of mimics and inhibitors was recently used to identify miRNAs that play a role in diverse herpes virus infections [murine CMV (MCMV), murine \u03b3 herpes virus\u201068 (MHV\u201068), and herpes simplex virus\u20101 (HSV\u20101); ref. 59]. By evaluating the phenotypic effect induced by mimics and corresponding inhibitors, the study was able to identify 4 antiviral and 3 proviral miRNAs that acted across diverse \u03b2\u2010herpes viruses. Further analysis implicated the miRNAs in a variety of host signaling networks, including extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, among others (59).

As far as is practical, researchers try to use cell types that are most representative of their biology of interest (for example a lung cell line to investigate influenza infection), but full genome\u2010wide RNAi screens with primary cells is often impractical. For this reason, most screens utilize immortalized cell lines. In general, these cells are amenable to the standard transfection/transduction procedures used in RNAi screening, but it is recognized that cell lines maintained in culture for long periods of time have significantly altered genomes, epigenomes, and transcriptomes. In truth, these differences may be one of the largest contributors to screen\u2010to\u2010screen variation observed across host\u2010pathogen studies. For this reason, putative hits identified in the primary screen are often validated using counterscreens that employ alternative cell types, related viruses, or siRNAs (or shRNAs) targeting different seed sites on the same gene, or small\u2010molecule inhibitors known to target the gene of interest.

To minimize the impact of these restrictions on assay workflow, RNAi screens that utilize high\u2010level pathogens limit the amount of work performed at the highest level of containment by performing siRNA transfections and cell handling in regular BSL\u20102 laboratories, and moving cells to high biocontainment for the infection phases only. Once the infection period is complete, protocols allow for virus\u2010infected plates to be decontaminated for removal, allowing functional readouts to be performed outside containment.

Pseudotype viruses mimic the viral entry process of the original virus and are competent for a single cycle of infection. The shortcomings associated with using pseudoviral particles are that not all envelope proteins can be incorporated in the carrier virus and their value in investigating postentry processes is limited. As such, researchers can gain valuable information regarding host\u2010encoded viral receptors and endocytic pathways that facilitate viral entry, but subsequent steps in replication may be masked. Such viruses have been used in vaccine development for highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus, Ebola, and Lassa hemorrhagic fever virus as means to work around biosafety issues in working with wild\u2010type viruses (64\u201366).",

Some screens focused on early replication events only (31, 33), while others included both early and late events (30, 32, 67). Furthermore, each screen examined different subsets of host genes and utilized unrelated cell models ranging from permissive cells (32, 33) to cells that influenza does not naturally infect (30, 31, 67). The 6 screens generated a list of potentially relevant host genes that represented ~2% of the screened genes. An exception was Shapira et al. (67), which focused on genes previously implicated in a yeast 2\u2010hybrid (Y2H) study, and therefore observed a significantly higher (35%) hit rate. As has been observed in several host\u2010pathogen RNAi screens, the candidates identified across all of the screens had little overlap. Overall, only 3 genes were independently validated in 4 of the 6 screens, 9 genes were validated in 3 of 6 screens, and 86 genes were validated across 2 screens (Table\n2). The absence of overlap in influenza screen hit lists suggests that the identity of specific cellular factors involved in the response to an influenza virus infection is context dependent and influenced by experimental factors that vary from screen to screen. This is supported by the observation that hit lists identified by Karlas et al. (32) and Konig et al. (33), both of which used A549 cells and WSN/33 virus, show the highest degree of overlap. Given that other factors, including differences in sources of media and serum, variability in the chromosomal insertion position of reporter constructs, and inconsistency in the silencing efficiency of different siRNAs collections, may all contribute to the observed disparities, a more global approach to screen analysis is required. In the context of host\u2010pathogen RNAi screens, this has generally come in the form of meta\u2010analysis that includes in\u2010depth literature review and programs such as ingenuity pathway analysis (68) and others that can identify significant networks, top functions and canonical pathways associated with the different gene hits uncovered by the screen and provide biological insight into the interactions between genes, proteins, chemicals, pathways, cellular phenotypes, and disease processes (69\u201376). The observed pathway fidelity from such analysis suggests a conserved set of core processes that are robust to experimental variability and may be coopted during influenza virus infection and replication in a mammalian cell.

Among the family of RTKs are the group of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), consisting of four members (EGF, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors; ref. 77). ErbB expression has been associated with a multitude of cellular functions and responses, including proliferation, cell migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (78\u201381). Cellular endocytosis of influenza coopts pathways used by EGFRs, resulting in protein ubiquitinylation and sorting into the vacuolar pathway (82). In addition, influenza virus particles are sorted into the same population of late endosomes as EGFRs (83). Specific inhibition of tyrosine kinases by small\u2010molecule inhibitors, as well as specific EGFR inhibition via RNAi, reduces virus uptake and subsequent virus titers (84). Furthermore, attachment of influenza virus to the host cell causes clustering of plasma membrane lipids, similar to that seen following EGF stimulation. Therefore, on influenza virus binding to host cell sialic acids, it is able to cluster and activate EGFRs and other RTKs to form a lipid raft\u2010based signaling platform (84). This leads to receptor\u2010mediated signaling events, which enhance influenza virus uptake and subsequent viral replication. It is thought that this activation is not mediated by viral engagement of a particular receptor kinase but is a more general phenomenon that affects several RTKs (84). This is additionally supported by results of a recent siRNA screening study, which identified the involvement of fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR 1, 2, and 4 as RTKs in the very early steps of viral infection (33). Therefore, influenza virus entry accompanied by down\u2010regulation of signaling receptors promotes coendocytosis of the virus into the host cell.",

Although NF\u2010\u03baB is generally regarded as a central factor in the innate immune defense (108), two independent studies demonstrated that replication of influenza viruses were impaired rather than enhanced in cells where this pathway was blocked (109, 110). NF\u2010\u03baB acts via induction of proapoptotic factors, such as TNF\u2010related apoptosis\u2010inducing ligand (TRAIL) or FasL (109), and subsequent activation of caspases (111). This results in an enhanced export of viral RNPs from the nucleus, presumably by specific cleavage of nuclear pore proteins, resulting in an enhanced diffusion of the RNP through the pores (112, 113). Lastly, NF\u2010\u03baB differentially regulates viral RNA synthesis (10). Each of these mechanisms may contribute to a different extent to the enhancing effect of NF\u2010\u03baB on virus propagation, thereby identifying the factor as a potential target for antiviral intervention. Besides the direct antiviral action, NF\u2010\u03baB inhibition may also indirectly influence and, in fact, exacerbate the pathogenesis of influenza virus, since the majority of cytokines/chemokines induced during infection with highly pathogenic viruses are regulated by NF\u2010\u03baB (107).",

Several practices could offset the challenges associated with disparate hit lists. One would be to follow the direction of researchers in the microarray field who have developed a consistent set of minimum information standards complemented with a centralized, publicly accessible portal for data submission and review (114, 115). Minimum information about an RNAi experiment (MIARE; http://miare.sourceforge.net/) is a standards concept for RNAi screening that advocates all published screening data include extensive experimental details regarding target cell sources, delivery methods, assay design, plate layout, reagent composition, controls, and metrics of data analysis (116). In 2008, a database was established for submission of MIARE\u2010compliant RNAi screens. While the ongoing development of the MIARE standards and the codevelopment of the PubMed database for RNAi screens represents important progress, community\u2010wide adoption of MIARE standards and submission policies has not yet been achieved.

On the basis of the findings from the meta\u2010analyses of influenza screens (31, 67, 136\u2013138), it is likely that influenza virus principally coopts host genes late during virus replication. Succinctly, influenza virus carries all necessary proteins to infect a cell and deliver its vRNP into the cell nucleus. However, viral proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm; thus, the virus must use host proteins and pathways to import NP and RNA polymerases back into the nucleus to form new vRNP. Likewise, the assembly of influenza components occurs at the plasma membrane, requiring host mechanisms to move new vRNP from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and then traffic the viral protein components toward the membrane for assembly and packaging of new virions. This hypothesis is consistent with the subtle differences that have been observed in viral genomic expression relative to the huge differences observed in high\u2010content analysis and in virus replication (33, 136). In addition, in the meta\u2010analyses studies (31, 67, 136\u2010138), host factors linked with regulating cell death are affected by influenza virus, a feature likely required to facilitate replication.",
