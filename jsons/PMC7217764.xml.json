A previously unknown novel virus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with a characteristic crown morphology at electron microscopy scanning was identified as the source of this disease [2]. Subsequently, the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was official termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020 [3]. As of March 13, 2020, a total of 81,003 patients with confirmed COVID-19, including 3181 deaths, have been reported in China [4]. From current knowledge of the cases, most patients with mild and common symptoms have a relatively good prognosis while cases of death are more frequently seen in severe and critical patients, which could progress to severe pneumonia, ARDS and multiple organ failures leading to higher mortality [[5], [6], [7]]. Early diagnosis and accurate staging, therefore, are essential in COVID-19 patients.",

The main CT appearances of COVID-19 include ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidations, which have respectively been regarded as a marker of early and progression stage of disease [11]. Based on the above-mentioned image abnormalities, HRCT could provide supplementary information to improve the planning of treatment, and evaluate the variations of image. To the best of our knowledge, little literature focuses on the change of CT appearances among different clinical types during the course of medical treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the discrepancy of series CT manifestations in COVID-19 among different clinical types within the short-term follow-up periods, aiming to help clinicians monitor and predict outcome and to make more accurate and effective clinical decisions.",

The patients were subsequently subdivided into common, severe and critical groups based on clinical criteria [10]. The baseline data are recorded in Table 1\n.

As illustrated in Table 2, Table 3\n, the CT lesion extent and density scores were determined based on the anatomic distribution and density of lung lesions with reference to the reported semi-quantitative score system [12,13]. The extent score was assessed according to the extent of lesion distributed on the five lung lobes, and the density score was evaluated based on the percentages of GGO and consolidation in each COVID-19 lesion. Thus, the score range for both lungs in each patient is from 0 (no detectable abnormality) to 20 (more than 75% of each lung lobe involved by COVID-19 lesion and 100% of consolidation in each lesion).",

The discrepancies of CT finding among different clinical types could be explained as the CT abnormalities might respectively reflect the potential pathological abnormalities in different stages of the disease. Seen mainly in the early and decaying stages of the disease, GGOs might be associated with the pathological small amount of exudation of fluid in alveolar cavity and interlobular interstitial edema [19]. As a marker of more severe phase, consolidation could reflect the pathological features of a large amount of cell-rich or fibrous exudation accumulated in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitium [20]. Additionally, the extent of GGO and consolidation in severe and critical were greater than that of common cases. Similarly, severe and critical cases tend to have higher extent and density scores compared with common type patients by semi-quantitative score system. Therefore, CT findings could accurately evaluate the severity of disease with different clinical types, and provide evidence for the further management.",

We found that the variation of extent and progression obtained on the follow-up CT could exist among patients with different clinical conditions. In detail, the improvement of disease could be observed in common and severe type, exhibited as total or partial resolution of GGO or consolidation, result in decreasing of scope and density scores. These changes may relate to the underlying pathological features of fibrous exudation of the alveolar cavity and the disappearance of capillary congestion in the alveolar wall, which may represent a dissipation phase of COVID-19 pneumonia [[21], [22], [23]]. In contrast, critical case could progress to the more severe phase of disease during the same period of follow-up CT, represented by enlargement of GGOs, and increasing volume and attenuation of consolidation [[24], [25], [26]]. Numerous GGOs might be associated with the invasion of adjacent lung tissues and spread in lung [20]. As the pathologic feature mainly including infiltration of alveolar by inflammatory cells and deposition of exudation in the airway wall accompanied by destroyed and incomplete alveolar structures, change in consolidation could indicate the continuous progress of the disease, which has been reported by previously studies [27,28].",
