Indeed, in some cases researchers use these data sources without considering that they constitute a naturally occurring source of information about health and illness. This includes television programmes, documentaries, magazines, newspapers, policy documents, medical notes, and natural diaries. The world's media is full of reports and references to physical and mental health conditions, including references to services, stigma, disorders, and societal views. Through various media sources and through a range of difference natural texts, it is possible to perform a range of qualitative analytic approaches on this naturally occurring data.",

Additionally, mental health receives less press coverage than general medicine (Lawrie, 2000) .

The representation of illness in the media tends to focus on illness as a deviation from society's norms (Rozonova, 2006) . Furthermore, certain physical diseases also have stigma perpetuated by the media, such as cancer and AIDS, and this can increase the patient's suffering and hinder help-seeking (Sontag, 1991) .

They demonstrated in their study that coverage of the epidemic occurred in three short periods and public opinion seemed to shift and debates in government began. They also noted that typical stories about AIDS tended to report it in sensationalising ways rather than reassuring ways, and the media utilised doctors and government officials as evidence for the news being reported.

They noted that this was necessary as there were concerns about how the media might contribute to the developing culture of excessive drinking, particularly in younger people. For their study, they examined alcohol comments across six radio stations in England, with a data corpus of 12 h of radio. Analyses were quantitative and qualitative, and they identified 703 comments about alcohol with 244 involving presenters. They reported that 73% of the comments that were initiated by presenters and 45% of comments from all sources encouraged drinking. The authors argued that alcohol comments seemed to create an identity for programmes and to forge connections between presenters and audiences. Notably, the idea that alcohol is required for having a good time was rarely directly challenged on the radio. The data showed that weekend drinking and partying were key themes, and findings suggested that alcohol comments played a role in marketing and branding of radio output. The authors argued that comments about alcohol are shaped by the conventions of media that can make it difficult to challenge discourses about excessive drinking.",

As such they provide a useful source of data to examine the rhetorical and persuasive aspects. One of the techniques used by marketing companies is to produce advertisements with controversial subject matter that encourages conversation about the source of controversy. Furthermore, the advertising placement has implications and could be a topic of study in its own right. It is worth considering who the target audience of advertisements might be.

Allan noted however that this process of representation is not a neutral reflection of society. Part of the presentation of the news is the news interview. These can be preplanned with certain individuals being invited into the studio for interview or can be more in situ on the streets where an event is taking place live with opportunistically selected individuals from those circumstances.

Notably, such textual and visual data through media texts reflect the technology available for producing them, (Garrett & Bell, 1998) and provide a rich source of accessible data that can provide a great deal of information about social meanings projected through language and communication (Bell, 1995) . Obviously, the caveat that all naturally occurring data is produced for a context and purpose applies to newspaper and magazine data. Perhaps, this is even more important to bear in mind given that newspaper reporting is traditionally aligned to certain political affiliations. Newspapers can provide a rich data source for analysis of areas related to health and illness, as this is one of the most commonly reported topics of public interest. One of the popular areas of reporting is that of global public health concerns, such as the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and more recently the outbreaks of Ebola and SARS. The reporting of such global health conditions has drawn research attention, with researchers exploring the media's representations. Joffe and Haaroff (2002) examined the correlation between the messages portrayed in popular tabloid media relating to the Ebola outbreak in Africa and British people's patterns of thinking in relation to these events. The focus of the analysis was to explore how the people interviewed perceived the crisis as a potential threat to Britain and compared with this with media representations in newspapers. The aim was to examine if media representations of Ebola influenced lay thinking about the disease. Similarly, Washer (2004) examined the way in which UK newspapers presented severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a danger to the UK public. This research utilised social representation theory to highlight the mechanisms used by newspapers to report on epidemics of global infectious diseases.",

Rozonova argued that the popular media are potentially irresponsible to suggest that ill health in older adults is a moral issue and to idealise healthy ageing, when in reality, physical decline is an inevitable aspect of the ageing process. The research noted that newspapers reported on 'health sins', specifically, poor diet, bad habits, and poor lifestyle choices (such as smoking, lack of exercise, and alcohol consumption), and claimed that these were due to lack of taking individual responsibility for health.",

The results of the study demonstrated that for every tested cause of death, there was a disproportion between the text devoted to the cause and the real number of attributable deaths. Examples and statistics are provided by the authors. They conclude from their work that the news media misrepresents the prevalence of leading causes of death and the risks associated with them. They claimed that this misrepresentation may contribute to the distorted perceptions that people hold about threats to their health. This book chapter is a useful example of how naturally occurring film data can provide important information about health. In this the authors explore the powerful influences of film on the rhetoric of mental health, by looking at representations of autism in film. The authors utilise discourse analysis to examine influential knowledge about adult autism and to explore how the images in film can have effects on the discourses of autism. The authors argue that such representation provides a restrictive frame for the viewer and too frequently depicts autism in negative and stereotyped ways.",
