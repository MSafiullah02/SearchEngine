The production of fever simultaneously with lymphocyte activation constitutes the clearest and strongest evidence in favour of the protective role of fever.The protective processes of the immune response are optimal at high temperature (around 39.5 \u00b0C).Not all effects resulting from fever generation benefit the host; some are harmful and even lethal. This occurs mainly by overproduction of the cytokines or imbalance between cytokines and their inhibitors, such as severe and fulminate infections and septic shock.\n",

            "text": "Research in fever has been centred on the hypothesis that fever results from physiological processes that are set in motion by an external stimulus. Egyptian scholars recognized that local inflammation was responsible for fever. In 1868, Billroth (1829\u20131894) attempted to confirm this ancient observation by injecting pus into animals, thereby producing a febrile response. In 1943, Menkin carried out similar experiments and isolated a product termed \u201cpyrexin\u201d [1]. Beeson in 1948 isolated a fever-inducing substance from a leukocyte, leukocyte pyrogens, which later became known as endogenous pyrogen (EP). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) was first identified as a cytokine by Gery and Waksman and proved to be identical with EP [2].",

            "text": "\n\nFever (pyrexia) isa regulated body temperature above the normal range occurring as a result of IL-1-mediated elevation of the hypothalamic set point. Once fever is established, body temperature is regulated, as in health, by a net balance between heat production and loss.\nHyperthermia is an unregulated elevated body temperature above the normal range due to imbalance between heat production and loss. Interleukins are not involved and therefore the hypothalamic set point is normal.A pyrogen is a substance (infectious organisms or their product toxins or cytokines) that provokes fever.\nExogenous pyrogens are substances, which originate outside the body and which are capable of inducing interleukins.\nEndogenous pyrogens are substances, which originate inside the body and which are capable of inducing fever by acting on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre. IL-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (INF) are endogenous of albumin and transferrin decreases. Characteristically there are a decreased concentration of iron and zinc and an increased copper concentration. The low iron is the result of reduced intestinal assimilation of iron and increased liver storage of iron. These changes contribute to host defence by depriving invading micro-organisms of essential nutrients, such as iron and zinc. The process is referred to as nutritional immunity.\nCytokines are proteins produced throughout the body, mainly by activated macrophages, monocytes and T cells to regulate the immune responses within the body, control inflammatory and haematopoietic processes and may induce fever. As they enter the circulation and act on distant organs, they are considered as hormones. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, granulocytes-macrophages colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF) are responsible for initiating an effective defence against exogenous organisms (e.g. activating neutrophils). Their overproduction may be harmful by causing shock, multiple organ failure and death. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-4, IL-10) antagonize the pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus promoting healing and reducing inflammation.\nMonokines are cytokines that are produced by mononuclear phagocytic cells.\nChemokines are cytokines that attract cells to the site of infection using chemical message (chemotaxis). Typical chemokine is CXCL-8 that attracts neutrophils.\nInterleukins are cytokines, acting specifically as mediators between leukocytes, hence their name. Their number known nowadays is enormous: at least 37 interleukins have been identified. If their amino acid sequence is known, they are assigned an interleukin number. If their sequence is not known, then they are named according to the biological property. IL-1 and IL-6 play a major part in the pathogenesis of fever.\nLymphokines are cytokines that are secreted by lymphocytes to regulate the immune response. Important lymphokines are IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-14 and TNF-gamma.Prostaglandins are lipids that are made at sites of infection and tissue damage to produce inflammation and fever as part of the healing process.\nAcute-phase response is the term used for haematological, endocrinological and metabolic changes that follow (within hours or days) the onset of fever in response to infections or local damage to a tissue. These changes are induced by several cytokines (IL-6 being the primary inducer), which are beneficial to the host. During the response, various acute-phase proteins, notably C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A, are synthesized by hepatocytes and released into circulation in large amounts. CRP plays a role in complement activation, opsonization and increasing platelet aggregation. Although acute-phase response is closely associated with fever, CRP levels can be normal in viral infections and high in diseases without fever (e.g. tumours). Syntheses of albumin and transferrin and the concentration of iron and zinc decrease, while copper concentration increases. The low iron is the result of reduced intestinal assimilation of iron and increased liver storage of iron. These changes contribute to host defence by depriving invading micro-organisms of essential nutrients, such as iron and zinc. The process is referred to as nutritional immunity.\n",

            "text": "\nGram-negative bacteria. The pyrogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli, Salmonella) is due to a heat-stable factor, endotoxin. The active components of endotoxin are lipid and carbohydrate (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), which are the major components of the outer membrane of these bacteria. Endotoxin causes a dose-related progressive increase in temperature. In severe cases, it causes shock with vasodilatation, capillary leakage and hypotension. Septicaemia caused by Gram-negative endotoxin does not elicit fever in certain situations such as neonates, young infants or children with fulminating infection or with malnutrition. These children may present with normal temperature or even hypothermia in response to severe infection. Mortality is significantly higher in septic children [3] and adult [4] patients due to reduced capacity to release TNF-\u03b1 and IL-\u03b2 upon infection with LPS.Gram-positive bacteria. The main pyrogen of most bacteria is peptidoglycan that forms the cell wall. Penicillin works by inhibiting the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, which results in cell lysis. This explains why penicillin is more effective against Gram-positive bacteria.\nViruses. It is well known in clinical practice that viruses cause fever. Mechanisms by which viruses may produce fever include direct invasion of macrophages, immunological reaction to viral components involving antibody formation, induction by INF and necrosis of cells by viruses.\nFungi. Live or killed fungal products are exogenous pyrogens that induce fever. The induction of fever mainly occurs when the fungi are in the bloodstream. Children with neoplastic diseases who develop fever associated with neutropenia are at high risk for developing invasive fungal infection.\n",

An exogenous antigen may react with circulating, sensitized antibodies to form a complex, which induces IL-1 production (immune fever). Examples of immunologically mediated fever include systemic lupus erythematosis and adverse drug reactions. Fever associated with penicillin hypersensitivity results from interaction of antigen-antibody complexes with leukocytes, which release IL-1.Most steroids are endogenous antipyretics, which suppress fever through their inhibitory effects on IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 production as well as inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Certain steroids, however, are pyrogenic in human such as etiocholanolone, a major metabolite of testosterone and 17-ketosteroid, which induce the release of interleukin-1. Etiocholanolone produces fever only when injected intramuscularly (not intravenously). Etiocholanolone fever is characterized by recurrent fever for few days, in association with arthralgia, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, high ESR and etiocholanolone level. Fever does not respond to antipyretics but to steroids, e.g. prednisolone. Etiocholanolone is responsible for fever in some patients with adrenogenital syndrome.Other nonmicrobial pyrogens include some hormones, drugs and intracranial lesions such as bleeding and thrombosis\n",

The origin of both monocytes and macrophages is the granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) in the bone marrow. Monocytes enter the circulation either to remain there for a few days as circulating monocytes or to migrate to the tissue where they undergo functional and morphological transformation into macrophages, when their life span is several months.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT), localized mainly in the neck and scapular area, is highly vascularized and contains a large quantity of mitochondria. Fatty acid oxidation in these mitochondria can increase heat production to twofold in response to cold.In older children and adults, the first response to cold is behavioural (e.g. curling up, putting more clothes). If this response is insufficient, then the hypothalamic centre is stimulated to conserve heat by vasoconstriction and generate heat by shivering. The predominant stimulus for shivering is the skin rather than the core temperature. The energy produced is released as heat.BAT was, until recently, thought to be only functional in neonates and some animals. BAT as a non-shivering thermogenesis has now emerged as a significant component of thermoregulation in elevating body temperature. This process induces and activates mitochondria, which uncouples protein to release chemical energy as heat. The BAT-metabolic thermogenesis is regulated by norepinephrine which is secreted by BAT-sympathetic nerve terminals.\n",

When the body core temperature rises (e.g. fever), heat loss through evaporation (causing sweating) becomes the primary mechanism of heat loss. This is associated with cutaneous vasodilatation via acetylcholine-mediated relaxation of the vascular smooth muscles. The following are the mechanisms by which heat loss occurs at rest:About one-quarter is lost by evaporation from the skin and lungs, which occurs as water is converted from liquid to gas (58 kcal is lost for every 100 mL of water).In general, 60% of the total heat is lost by radiation (transfer of heat from the skin surface to the external surroundings not in contact), through electromagnetic waves.Convection (12% of the heat loss) is increasing blood flow to body surfaces to maximize heat loss.Conduction (3% of the heat loss) is the heat transfer between two objects in direct contact and at different temperatures. This is the primary mode of heat loss from the core to the surface.\n",

            "text": "In the classical\nmodel of pathogenesis, fever induction includes the following stages:Pyrogenic endogenous cytokines (e.g. IL-1, TNF, IL-6 and interferons) are released into the bloodstream in response to exogenous pyrogens (e.g. viruses, bacteria, toxins).These endogenous pyrogens act on a specific preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus, which contains clusters of thermo-sensitive neurons localized within the rostral wall of the third ventricle. The site is called organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), which has emerged as an interface between circulation and brain. The firing rate of these thermo-sensitive neurons changes according to the temperature of the area\u2019s blood supply and the input from the skin and muscular thermoreceptors. Warm-sensitive neurons have firing rates that increase with warming and decrease with cooling, whereas the firing rates of cold-sensitive neurons increase with cooling or decrease with warming.Endogenous pyrogens enter the perivascular space of the OVLT through the fenestrated capillary wall to stimulate cells to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which diffuses into the adjacent preoptic area to upturn the temperature set point and cause fever.Another structure termed circumventricular organs (CVOs), which are situated in the anterior wall of the third ventricle. These organs are characterized by extensive vasculature and lack of blood-brain barrier allowing direct exchange between blood and nervous tissue. When circulating pyrogenic cytokines are detected by the CVOS, PGE2 is induced.The ultimate result of these complex mechanisms is an upward shift of the thermostatic set point to a febrile level that signals efferent nerves, especially sympathetic fibres innervating peripheral blood vessels, to initiate heat conservation (vasoconstriction) and heat production (shivering). This is aided by behavioural means aimed also to increase body temperature, such as seeking a warmer environment or covering up with a blanket. The resulting temperature increase continues until body temperature approximates to the temperature of the elevated set point.The raised set point is reset back to normal if the concentration of the cytokines falls or if antipyretics are administered that block prostaglandin synthesis. The normalization of temperature is initiated by vasodilatation and sweating through increased skin blood flow controlled by sympathetic fibres. Prostaglandin E2 has been found to exert a negative feedback on the release of the cytokines, thus terminating the mechanisms that initially induced the fever\n",

            "text": "The generation of fever involves the following steps:Numerous substances from outside the body, exogenous pyrogens, initiate the fever cycle. Endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria, with their pyrogenic component lipopolysaccharide, is the most potent exogenous pyrogen. Fever is also a common finding in children without obvious evidence of infection, for example hypersensitivity reaction, autoimmune diseases and malignancy.Exogenous pyrogens initiate fever by inducing host cells (primarily macrophages) to produce and release endogenous pyrogens such as interleukin-1, which has multiple biological functions essential for the immune response.Endogenous pyrogens are transmitted to the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre, specifically organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), where they induce synthesis of prostaglandins, of which PGE2 is the most important. These raise the thermostatic set point to initiate the febrile response.The hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre accomplishes heat production by inducing shivering and heat conservation through vasoconstriction. At an established degree, fever is regulated (even at a temperature of over 41.0 \u00b0C), and heat production approximates loss, as in health, though at a higher level of the set point. Therefore fever does not climb up relentlessly.In addition to the function as an endogenous pyrogen, IL-1 activates T-lymphocytes to produce various factors, such as INF and IL-2, which are vital for immune response. The production of fever simultaneously with lymphocyte activation constitutes the clearest and strongest evidence in favour of the protective role of fever.The induction of fever results in inhibition of bacterial growth, increased bactericidal of neutrophils, production of acute-phase protein synthesis and other physiological changes such as anorexia and somnolence. These changes suggest that fever has an adaptive role in the host\u2019s survival during infection (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-92336-9_9 for detail).\n",
