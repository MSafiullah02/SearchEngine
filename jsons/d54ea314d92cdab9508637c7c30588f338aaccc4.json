Furthermore, decreased innate immune cytokine responses have been shown to correlate with disease severity not only in RSV but also in rhinovirus bronchiolitis (26) . Multiple respiratory virus detection occurs in 20-40% of children with respiratory virus infections, but this finding seems to be less common in young infants.

The virological diagnosis of infants treated as outpatients is not always necessary as it does not predict the severity or length of the disease. It may, however, guide the decision about whether the infant should be hospitalised or treated as an outpatient. The detection of the viral aetiologic agent in hospitalised infants is important with regard to understanding the clinical manifestations, for guiding the cohorting of patients and for the prevention of nosocomial infections. In addition, virological diagnosis provides essential data for the development of prevention strategies (14) . Previously, viral diagnostics was based on virus culture, serology or antigen detection. These labour-intensive and slow diagnostic methods have nowadays been replaced with PCR tests. With the rapid development of highthroughput molecular techniques, several new viruses associated with respiratory diseases, such as the bocavirus-1, metapneumovirus and coronavirus have been identified, and our knowledge of respiratory virus infections has substantially increased. PCR tests are also significantly more sensitive than the other methods, which has increased the rates of viral detection. Over the past decade, PCR tests have been multiplexed and it is now possible to screen up to 16-20 respiratory viruses concurrently from a single mucus sample with a flocked nasal swab (28) . However, it must be kept in mind that the sensitivity of multiplex PCR tests is not as high as that of PCR tests for detecting a single virus. It should also be emphasised that in contrast to a positive virus culture, a positive PCR test does not necessarily reflect active virus replication. A rhinovirus PCR test is positive during and after symptomatic infection, in subclinical infection, or just in an innocent contamination (15) . Transcriptional profiling is a useful tool for discriminating between an active infection and incidental virus detection (29) .

Most respiratory viruses are acquired postnatally through close contact with infected caregivers. Nevertheless, current evidence supports the concept that the transmission of some viruses to neonates may also occur during the antenatal period through maternal viraemia and transplacental spread to the foetus, or perinatally by exposure to maternal infected secretions (30) . The onset of symptoms following infection with respiratory viruses varies from 24 hours to several days. As described earlier, the initial signs and symptoms of respiratory virus diseases in neonates can be identical to those seen in bacterial infections. Furthermore, routine laboratory markers are inconclusive in differentiating bacterial from viral infections, especially during the early phase of the disease. In a recent study in children aged from one to 24 months, interferon inducible myxovirus resistance protein A had a 92% sensitivity for symptomatic respiratory virus infections (31) . Because the outcome of a neonatal bacterial infection is markedly improved if the illness is recognised early and appropriate antimicrobial agents are administered promptly, it is plausible that viral diseases in neonates are often treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (11) . Thus, we recommend that any infant with suspected late-onset or nosocomial sepsis or signs of a serious infection, should also be evaluated for the most common respiratory viruses with multiplex PCR test from nasopharyngeal specimens, in addition to a complete sepsis workup (10, 13) . Practitioners could also be advised to order a multiplex PCR test for respiratory viruses in infants if they demonstrate an earlyonset sepsis-like clinical presentation and bacterial samples remain negative.

Furthermore, certain single-nucleotide genetic polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with chronic respiratory morbidity and asthma following RSV infection (54) . Although it is conceivable that respiratory viral infections might lead to the development of asthma, by damaging the developing airways or altering the immune response (55) , it has also been suggested that viral infections may simply reveal a pre-existing tendency for asthma by inducing mucous metaplasia and airway hyperresponsiveness (56) .

Given the significant burden of respiratory virus infections among this highly susceptible population, and the limited prevention tools that are available, a focus on appreciating and containing the consequences of these infections is warranted. It can be recommended that any infant with signs of infection should also be suspected of having a respiratory virus infection. Simple flocked nasal swabs and multiplex PCR tests are recommended as diagnostic methods. Furthermore, all available preventive and curative modalities against viral respiratory tract infections during the neonatal period should be implemented. Preventing nosocomial virus infections by using intensified hygiene measures and cohorting infected infants should be a major goal in NICUs. Further research, active virus surveillance and long-term follow-up are also needed to ascertain the causality and the exact underlying mechanisms for adverse long-term consequences.", "cite_spans":
