Creating content using new media brings new opportunities, which historically, is an approach longused in the field of fine art. With VR, visual art artists can enjoy \"unrestricted\" space for creative work while exploiting features that are not possible in the physical world [15] . However, employing new media and alternate reality in fine art requires new understanding of how audiences interact with and experience new forms of content to inform a creative process. For the visual arts, this means establishing a better understanding of how viewers approach an artwork and navigate through a virtual environment. The research on user attention in VR encounter can lead to new developments within art practice where user activity data and computer programming can serve as a dynamic tool for innovation [10] .",

Goodyear is experienced in using Google Tilt Brush to create experimental abstract VR paintings. An experimentation system is developed using Unity games engine in order to install any artwork and enable user navigation. With a combination of hardware and software functions, the system is equipped with multi-modal eye gaze and body movement tracking capabilities to capture user interactions with the artwork. A user experiment was conducted, where 35 participants explored an abstract VR painting according to their own preference. The participants' eye-gaze, body movements, and voice comments were recorded while they freely moved within a 3 by 4 metre physical space. The majority of participants approached the virtual works with confidence, to become immersed within the artwork. Many participants claimed that the new form of media encouraged an interest in not only these abstract VR paintings, but also abstract art in general. The quantitative experimental data showed distinctive activity patterns which reflect different preferences in moving locations, body positions, and viewing angles. In order to model and predict user preferences, deep-learning techniques were employed to study the connections between users behavioural data and the audience background/previous experience. To enhance the feedback loop from user experiments to content creators, new ways to visualise user attention in virtual environments were also piloted. The results can be particularly useful for artists who are looking to adapt their art practices based on audience experiences and for the creative industry to develop new applications. It is felt that a tracking and data analysis engine, paired with games development engines have the possibility to become a new tool to augment art creation process, echoing how AI assists engineering and computer science designs.",

Blortasia is an abstract art world in the sky where viewers fly freely through a surreal maze of evolving sculptures [21] . Authors believe the exploration through art and nature reduces stress, anxiety and inflammation, and has positive effects on attitude, behaviour, and well-being. Hayes, et al. created a virtual replication of an actual art museum with features such as gaze-based main menu interaction, hotspot interaction, and zooming/movement in a 360 degree space. Authors suggested that allowing viewers to look around as they please and focus their attention on the interaction happening between the artwork and the room is something that cant be replicated easily [16] . In [6] , Battisti, et al. presented a framework for a virtual museum based on the use of HTC VIVE. The system allows moving in the virtual space via controllers as well as walking. A subjective experiment showed that VR, when used in a cultural heritage scenario, requires that the system should be designed and implemented by relying on multi-disciplinary competences such as arts and computer science.",

Authors carried out a user study where participants perform controlled VR tasks including pointing, grabbing, walking, and typing while the system monitoring their head, hand, and eye motion data. Classification methods were used to associate behaviour data to users [26] . Furthermore, avatars are commonly used to represent attendees in social VR applications. Body tracking has been used to animate the motions of the avatar based on the body movements of human controllers [7] . In [20] full visuomotor synchrony is achieved using wearable trackers to study implicit gender bias and embodiment in VR.",

This includes how they change their location by walking to explore different parts of the artwork or to change their viewing perspective, how they split their attention between thousands of brushstrokes, whether they walk into the artwork to have a more immersive experience, whether they reach out in an attempt to touch, and how they verbalise to their experience. 2) to visualise user interactions in VR as a means to provide user experience feedback to VR visual artists and HCI designers. 3) to model eye-gaze and movement data to enable a better understanding of human attention and personal experiences in VR. Figure 1 depicts the system tailored to support the research. The artwork is created in Google Tilt Brush and ported to Unity, a games engine, using an in-house conversion tool. Then an art exploration application was created in the format of a VR game allowing user navigation and activity tracking. VIVE Pro Eye [1] was chosen as the reference VR headset for the user experiment while the system also supports FOVE 0 [11]. VIVE Pro Eye has built-in eye-tracking capabilities (Tobi-based) and head position tracking using base stations. An additional real-time application was developed to extract, filter and store eye gaze and behavioural data in a database. Hand tracking was also incorporated by attaching a Leap Motion onto the VR headset though the analysis of hand movement data is outside the scope of this paper.",

To achieve this Goodyear used documentation of the painting process within the painting and in most cases this involved using their paper-based paint palettes. This process was continued in Google Tilt Brush, where an image was imported into the paint palette followed by extrapolation from it. As seen in this work, Goodear experimented with using physical palette imagery as a type of floor for the artworks and also as a backdrop. These works are described as \"phygital\", where the physical and digital were combined. This term, around since the turn of the century, was originally found in marketing to describe how customers in banking would interact with online platforms.

This means the system would only be able to tell whether a certain type of brushstrokes was looked at. As the authors were interested in user attention at individual brushstroke level, a conversion tool has been developed based on Tilt Brush Unity Toolkit [5] to retain brushstrokes as independent mesh objects using a unique identifier with the naming scheme: brushtype startingcolour artworkref seq. For instance, an oil paint brushstroke from the VR painting peacock with a starting colour 4278853398 (RGBA) and a unique ID of 5251 would be identified as OilPaint 4278853398 peacock 5251. The conversion tool can export the artwork as a single FBX file with brushstrokes separated internally or as separate FBX files while each holds one brushstroke.

Leap motion was used to provide data of hand movements and to simulate these movements in the game thus increasing content reliability from a player's perspective. The system also tracked eye blinking events to validate or bridge eye gaze activities. This was particularly important to identify long gaze events, which can be wrongly segmented due to eye blinking. VIVE Pro Eye SDK provides two types of eye tracking data, local and world space. Local space data provides eye orientation relative to the headset and is not associated with head orientation. World space data was used to take head orientation into consideration when computing eye orientation. World space data provided the raw data (eye x, eye y, eye z) as a combination of both left and right eye coordinates on a unit sphere.

In addition, Unity provided the player position along with head rotation that represented the direction of the head in the field using four dimensions (rotation x, rotation y, rotation z, rotation w) named quaternion.

As human eyes are constantly moving, it is understood that there is noise and redundancy in the eye gaze data. For instance, when we move our attention from one object to a different object, our eyes may pick up many other objects in between. In the case of this experiment, there are 555,727 eye gaze records captured including groups of three types of signals: \"Focus In\" which marks the moment a participant started gazing at an object, \"Normal Frame\" which is a heartbeat signal registered every 30 milliseconds while the gaze on an object continues, and \"Focus Out\" which flags the moment the participant moved the attention away from an object. Therefore, a one second long gaze would appear in record as one \"Focus In\" followed by around 30 \"Normal Frame\" then one \"Focus Out\". A \"Focus out\" is normally followed by another \"Focus In\" when the users attention switched to a new object. Eye orientation information within each signal group is nearly identical. Hence all \"Focus In\" events (a total number of 59,928) were extracted to represent all gaze events. The events captured the head location of the participant (as shown in Figure 7) , the unique Brushstroke ID, as well as the three dimensional eye orientation data (eye x, eye y and eye z) as shown on a sphere in Figure 9 .",

In general, the participants who were more active in moving their location were more likely to have looked in different directions, as demonstrated by p3425. Participants didn't travel deep into the artwork, for instance, p1679 often concentrated their attention on one half of the sphere as the artwork was mostly in front of them. Some dense areas at both poles of the sphere were also observed which indicates that the participants spent time investigating brushstrokes that are much lower than their eye level and also objects directly above them. No general eye orientation pattern was demonstrated across the entire participant group though some participants seem to share similar viewing preferences. The diversity of audience behaviour is also observed at brushstroke level. Figure 10 shows the eye orientation for four different brushstrokes with data from participants separated by colour. Many brushstrokes were viewed by the participants from different angles. Individual participants also looked at the same brushstrokes multiple times from different viewpoints. We surmise that this can be attributed to a combination of 1) the inherent qualities of VR i.e., 3D artwork and free audience movements (around or through objects) which encourages more exploration and diverse viewing angles; 2) how the artist choreographs audience interactions via design choices, such as composition, colour, texture. For instance, some brushstrokes are partially visible from an angle such that participants need to change their location to discover occluded content. This is further continued where shape and lighting configuration also allow some brushstrokes to change their appearance when viewed from different angles.",

In general it was noticeable that a longer viewing session led to more colours being encountered, with females being more likely to encounter more colours under the same condition as males.",

Figure 12 and Figure 13 show the top 15 colours encountered for female and male, measured by gaze duration (how long each colour was looked at) and gaze count (how many times a colour was looked at) respectively. The pie charts' colours resemble the actual brushstroke colour in the VR painting. It is important to point out that colour is only one of the many deterministic factors for user attention. Other factors include size, shape, structure, brushstroke type, distance to the viewer and composition within the artwork. In spite of the complexity behind human attention, in this comparison between genders, it seems female participants demonstrated a preference for green, while male participants viewed red brushstrokes more in terms of both duration and count. Using K-Means, an effective and commonly used method for clustering, the gaze data was separated into distinctive groups based on the distribution of their numerical values. Gaze events and their duration was gathered from all sessions, then K-Means method was applied with a range of configurations. Figure 14(a) shows the Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) results when data is split into different numbers of groups. WCSS evaluates the effectiveness of clustering by measuring the squared average distance of all gaze duration within a cluster to the cluster centroid. As the number of clusters increase, the WCSS decreases, which means better clustering at the data level though too many clusters prevent a clear understanding of the levels of user attention. With four clusters, the clustering has a good balance between domain interpretability and performance. Hence, we split the level of gaze into four degrees of user attention: quick scan, normal scan, short gaze, and long gaze with the centroid of 0.047, 0.338, 0.9530, and 2.488 seconds respectively.",

There are strong indications that some of these differences are attributed to participants' background such as gender, age, personality and related experiences/skills. If a non-intrusive quantitative measurement of human behaviour is used to accurately infer the background of the participants, it will be possible to deliver focused encounters and improved experiences for different user groups. This section provides a first attempt to classify art audiences by gender, age group, VR experience, gaming experience and art background based on six measurements: eye x, eye y, eye z, head x, head y, and head z. Table 1 shows the measurements taken from the first few seconds of a session. Questionnaire responses were used as a ground-truth labels for model training and validation. Our session-based schema considers each of the six measurements as sequential data that independently captured the participants' behaviour during a viewing session. This means that every column in Table 1 is an independent input used to classify participants. The order of data within each sequence is retained and treated as an important feature. The FDN takes six inputs and concatenates them before passing the data through three Dense layers with Dropouts to mitigate over-fitting ( Figure 15 ). The CNN structure adds a two-layer 1D convolutional base with MaxPooling to each of the six inputs before they are concatenated ( Figure 16 ). This should allow the network to exploit patterns in input sequential data. The patterns may reflect participants' distinctive movements such as \"leaning forward to closely inspect a paint brushstroke then moving back\" and \"turning their head from left to right to see more of the painting\". LSTM, as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) design, conducts multiple iterations of learning and uses outputs from previous steps to inform the current iteration. This allows the network to discover temporal dynamics in the sequential data. LSTM can exploit this additional \"context\" to process human behaviour. Two LSTM layers with recurrent Dropout were applied to each input layer as shown in Figure 17 .",

Therefore, the first 450 Focus-In events when participants started gazing a brushstroke were sampled from each participant for the modelling. The deep learning training on each of the three network structures was carried out 20 times independently. Each run started with a random 70/30 split on the dataset so that 70% of the data was randomly selected for training while the rest were used for validation. It was made sure that the data from any participant will fall in either the training set or the validation set. This ensured that the participants in the training set were entirely unknown to the validation process. A maximum of 200 epochs for each run was set but Keras' \"EarlyStopping\" callbacks was used to stop the training process and restore the best weights when the validation loss had stopped decreasing in several epochs.

A common method to visualise human attention is a 2D heat map of gaze intensity superimposed on the original content. The heat map is often semi-transparent so that the original objects remain partially visible. For VR, a 2D heat map can be added as an augmentation layer between a viewer and the artwork. Besides the negative impact to immersion, it becomes problematic when associating a 2D mark to a 3D brushstroke, especially in densely populated areas where brushstrokes intertwine. As such, the 2D heat map would also have to adapt to different viewing angles and distances. If an artwork is reviewed by multiple viewers, then each viewer would (Top2 accuracy) require a separate heat map instance. Hence we suggest a 2D heat map would be more suited to static viewing on a conventional monitor and not fit for data visualisations in VR.",
