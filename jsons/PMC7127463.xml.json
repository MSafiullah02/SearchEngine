In a prospective, 7-year study performed in the USA, over three quarters (83%) of 498 children who completed the investigation experienced at least one episode of acute OM (AOM) by the age of 3 years and 45% had suffered from at least three episodes [1]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that OM accounts for more than 20 million physician visits per annum in the USA [2]. Furthermore, in a recent multinational survey, paediatricians reported that they saw at least one patient with OM per day [3].",

            "text": "The underlying microbiology of infectious diseases is known to change in response to environmental factors, such as vaccination and antibiotic consumption. For example, the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis has changed in countries where Haemophilus influenzae type b [6], group C meningococcal, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been introduced, with a dramatic reduction in the incidence of bacterial meningitis overall. However, non-vaccine serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae now account for a more significant proportion of the disease in the countries where the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7; Prevnar\u2122/Prevenar\u21221\n) is widely used [7], [8]. Furthermore, S. pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin were recovered from human infections in the late 1960s in Australia and New Guinea [9]. Since then, penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae strains have spread all over the world and their prevalence has dramatically increased in various countries [10]. Moreover, S. pneumoniae accumulated multiple resistance determinants in some strains and serotypes [11], [12], [13], and modified the epidemiological landscape in some regions, including the USA [14]. Although in most regions, penicillin remains active against S. pneumoniae despite increased minimal inhibitory concentrations and can be used safely to treat pneumococcal infections other than meningitis, some multiresistant strains have been described in infections such as AOM [15]. A recent report from the USA presented nine clinical failures in AOM due to S. pneumoniae resistant to amoxicillin, oral cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and co-trimoxazole, and required tube placement for drainage and the use of levofloxacin, a drug which is not licensed for paediatric use [16]. In another recent US study, an increased proportion of severe mastoiditis cases was observed, mostly due to multiresistant serotype 19A S. pneumoniae\n[14].",

However, in selected cases (antibiotic treatment failure and complicated AOM), it is essential to identify the causative otopathogen accurately and determine its antibiotic susceptibility.

Although mastoiditis has become infrequent in industrialized countries (incidences from 0.3 to 6/100,000 child-year) [37], [38], [39], it is still a common belief that antibiotic treatment should be prescribed in AOM to prevent its occurrence. The prevention of mastoiditis by systematic antibiotic treatment of AOM has never been established [40], [41]. Many factors can account for variations in the incidence of mastoiditis in different countries: socio-economic and living conditions, antibiotic prescribing rates, exhaustiveness of the epidemiological surveillance systems, and differences in complication rates by pathogens [29], [38], [42]. Indeed, not all bacterial otopathogens have the same propensity to cause complications of AOM. GAS is associated with the most frequent and severe complications, such as mastoiditis (Table 1\n), while severe complications of H. influenzae are uncommon and those of M. catarrhalis infection are rare [29].",

In Europe, dual erythromycin and penicillin non-susceptibility varies widely between countries, from less than 1% to more than 25% [56]. While amoxicillin resistance in M. catarrhalis is universally seen in approximately 90% of the strains, it is still a limited occurrence in NTHi (a mean of 13% \u03b2-lactamase production in one international study) [57]. However, some regions, such as France, the USA, Japan, and other Southern Asian regions have high rates of amoxicillin resistance in NTHi [58], [59]. Several mechanisms cause this resistance, the most common being \u03b2-lactamase production, which is detected in most laboratories. However, other resistance mechanisms are increasingly being described in France and Japan, which confer additional resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, and sometimes to third-generation cephalosporins, and which are usually not investigated in routine microbiology [59], [60]. In a recent study conducted in Japan, only 44% of the NTHi strains isolated from children with URTIs were amoxicillin susceptible and 4% were \u03b2-lactamase producers; the others were also resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and to a various degree to cephalosporins [61].",

The introduction of PCV7 in the USA resulted in rapid shifts in the microbiology of OM [18], [43], [62], [63]. PCV7 vaccination was followed by rapid replacement with non-vaccine S. pneumoniae serotypes in the nasopharynx of vaccinated children and their siblings and, as a result, the proportion of AOM caused by vaccine serotypes has fallen and disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes and other pathogens, such as NTHi, has risen. For example, in one US study, significant increases in the percentage of AOM cases due to non-PCV7 pneumococcal serogroups occurred between 1999 and 2002 (from 12% to 32%, respectively; p\n < 0.01). However, no decline was observed in the penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae strains [63]. As mentioned previously, multidrug-resistant replacement serotypes may arise [16], stressing the need for reduced antibiotic prescribing in order to maximize the benefits of the vaccine in eliminating the most prevalent antibiotic-resistant serotypes. Additionally, the trend for an increase in persistent AOM and AOM treatment failure attributable to H. influenzae observed from 2001 to 2003 in a single US study centre [62] was also reported in three US centres for the period 2003\u20132006 [43].",
