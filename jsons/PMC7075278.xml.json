Using S-HR1 as a target, we have previously designed and developed several potent fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV (e.g., SARS-HR2P)4 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (e.g., MERS-HR2P).5 However, it is unclear whether 2019-nCoV also possesses a similar fusion and entry mechanism as that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and if so, whether a 2019-nCoV S-HR1 can also serve as an important target for the development of 2019-nCoV fusion/entry inhibitors.",

            "text": "In the post-fusion hairpin conformation of the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S protein, the HR2 domain forms both rigid helix and flexible loop to interact with HR1 domain (Fig. 1b). There are many strong interactions between HR1 and HR2 domains inside the helical region, which is thus designated \u201cfusion core region\u201d (HR1core and HR2core regions, respectively). According to the sequence alignment, the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV S2 subunits are highly conserved, with 92.6% and 100% overall identity in HR1 and HR2 domains, respectively. However, inside the HR1core region, 8 of the 21 residues show mutation (~38% difference). This is significantly different from the HR1core region of previously identified SARS-like viruses, such as WIV1, Rs3367, and RsSHC014, which are 100% identical to that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1b). These novel point mutations in 2019-nCoV S2 subunit may change the interaction pattern between HR1 and HR2 domains in the post-fusion core, thus affecting the 6-HB formation. Based on our previous experience, we have now designed HR1- and HR2-derived peptides, designated 2019-nCoV-HR1P (aa924\u2013965) and 2019-nCoV-HR2P (aa1168\u20131203), respectively (Fig. 1c), and explored their biological characteristics. Since the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV S-HR2 sequences are 100% identical, 2019-nCoV-HR2P may act as a fusion inhibitor in much the same way as our reported SARS-CoV fusion inhibitor, SARS-HR2P.4 Under native electrophoresis as described before,4 2019-nCoV-HR2P, which carries negative charges, moved down to a lower gel position, while 2019-nCoV-HR1P, which carries positive charges, moved up and off the gel (Fig. 1d) in a manner similar to SARS-CoV-HR1P4 in native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) assay. Notably, in the 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P mixture, new bands emerged at the upper part in the native-PAGE gel in a 2019-nCoV-HR1P dose-dependent manner, indicating that 2019-nCoV-HR2P could interact with 2019-nCoV-HR1P to form a complex, possibly 6-HB. We then assessed the secondary structures of 2019-nCoV-HR1P, 2019-nCoV-HR2P, and 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P complex, using circular dichroism as previously described.4 While 2019-nCoV-HR1P alone and 2019-nCoV-HR2P alone exhibited low helicity (<30%), the 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P complex exhibited the characteristic helicity of 6-HB, with minimum values at 208 and 222 nm and helicity of 84.4% (Fig. 1e). Moreover, the 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P complex showed good thermal stability with Tm of 66.2 oC (Fig. 1f).",

The 2019-nCoV-HR1P/EK1 complex also showed high helicity (77.9%) (Fig. 1i). EK1 also exhibited effective fusion inhibitory activity with IC50 of 0.19 \u00b5M (Fig. 1g). Taken together, these results suggest that the 2019-nCoV S-HR1 region is also a promising conserved target for developing effective CoV fusion/entry inhibitors.",

When S1 protein recognizes its receptor on human cells, the HR1 and HR2 domains are exposed to interact with each other, forming 6-HB to mediate membrane fusion between virus and target cell (Fig. 1k). Notably, both 2019-nCoV-HR2P and EK1, the pan-CoV fusion inhibitor, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against S-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and 2019-nCoV pseudovirus infection, suggesting potential development of either 2019-nCoV-HR2P or EK1 peptide in nasal spray and inhalation formulations, respectively, to prevent and treat 2019-nCoV infection.",

After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV S protein to the potential receptor ACE2 on the host cell, S2 subunit changes conformation by inserting FP into the cell membranes and triggering the association between the HR1 and HR2 domains to form 6-HB, which brings the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity for fusion (left part of k). In the presence of 2019-nCoV-HR2P or EK1 peptide, three copies of the peptide bind to the 2019-nCoV S-HR1-trimer to form heterologous 6-HB, thus blocking the formation of viral homologous 6-HB and thus inhibiting viral and cell membrane fusion (right part of k).",
