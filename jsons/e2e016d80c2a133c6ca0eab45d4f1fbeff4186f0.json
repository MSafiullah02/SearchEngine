Cumulating research findings show that amino acid restrictions are potential strategies for cancer interventions. Meanwhile, dietary strategies are popular among cancer patients. However, there is still lacking solid rationale to clarify what is the best strategy, why and how it is. Here, integrated analyses and comprehensive summaries for the abundances, signalling and functions of amino acids in proteomes, metabolism, immunity and food compositions, suggest that, intermittent fasting or intermittent dietary lysine restriction with normal maize as an intermittent staple food for days or weeks, might have the value and potential for cancer prevention or therapy. Moreover, dietary supplements were also discussed for cancer cachexia including dietary immunomodulatory.",

            "text": "Cancer is a complex disease. There are more than 100 distinct types of cancer but sharing common hallmarks, including sustaining proliferative signaling and evading growth suppressors 1, 2 . The anabolic and catabolic metabolisms of cancer cells must be reprogrammed to maintain their proliferation and survival, and may even hijack normal cells to create tumor microenvironment (TME) for tumorigenesis and avoiding immune destruction 2 . Due to the demands of cell growth and the needs of newly synthesized proteins as direct effectors of cellular activities, protein biosynthesis is the most energy-demanding process that accounts for ~33% of total ATP consumption 3, 4, 5 . Interestingly, cumulating research findings have demonstrated that amino acid (AA) restrictions play roles in cancer interventions, including glycine restriction 6 , serine starvation 7, 8, 9 , leucine deprivation 10 , glutamine blockade 11, 12 , asparagine 13 and methionine 14 . These findings inspire and motivate a number of questions. Is there a common and effective metabolic intervention for cancer? For amino acids (AAs), which is the most heavily used AA in vivo? Which AA restriction is cell proliferation the most sensitive to? What kind of dietary strategies are practically available for cancer control?",

It is well known that cells can use AAs (including asparate, glutamine, serine and glycine, Figure 1A) as carbon and nitrogen resources for the syntheses of nucleobases 15, 16, 17 . Consequently, the AA metabolisms of cancer cells could use ~33-58% of the total energy expenditure (ATP) for protein synthesis and RNA/DNA synthesis ( Figure 1B ).

Serine starvation induced stress and promoted p53-independent and p53-dependent metabolic remodelling in cancer cells 7 . Under the starvation of serine, the upregulation or enhancement of de novo serine synthesis pathway and oxidative phosphorylation were independent of p53, while the inhibition of nucleotide synthesis was dependent of p53-p21 activation so that the limited amount of de novo serine was shunted to glutathione production for the survival of cancer cells 7 .

As an EAA, tryptophan cannot be synthesized in vivo, and must be acquired from foods. This particular characteristic of tryptophan gave its additional roles beyond as a necessity in protein synthesis. For instance, immune system could induce tryptophan degradation to inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells 39 via interferon gamma (IFN-g) upregulating the tryptophan-catabolizing activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 40 . Meanwhile, cancer cells could use the same mechanism to impede and escape immune response in TME 41, 42 . Consequently, the clinical trials of IDO inhibitors showed limitations and off-target effects due to the multifaceted tryptophan metabolism 43 .",

It was also well known decades ago that 5-HT was involved in food intake and mood 48 , and recent research focused on the functional modulation of 5-HT6 receptor including its agonists and antagonists 49, 50 . Both the agonists and antagonists of 5-HT6 receptor could reduce food intake 49, 50 , which suggested that the activation curve of 5-HT6 receptor was likely a bell shape and that a proper concentration of 5-HT might increase food intake through 5-HT6 receptor. In short, tryptophan metabolism and its catabolites played active roles in proliferation, immunity, neurogenesis, anxiety, depression and food intake under physiological conditions.",

Methionine is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis, while N-formylmethionine-tRNA generated in mitochondrial folate cycle is the initiator of mitochondrial protein synthesis 67 (Figure 3 ). SAM provides the methyl group for epigenetic modification. The methionine cycle coupling with mitochondrial energy metabolism produces SAM, so that SAMTOR might sense not only methionine, also one-carbon resource and energy levels. The methionine cycle and folate cycle are two functional modules connected and involved in one-carbon metabolism 15, 16, 68 . Serine acts as one-carbon donor and tetrahydrofolate (THF) serve as one-carbon receptor in the folate cycle 16 . In the methionine synthase reaction (vitamin B12 as a essential cofactor), methyl-THF donates its methyl group via vitamin B12 to homocysteine to produce methionine and THF 69 . The one-carbon metabolism of cancer cell may mobilize multiple carbon sources including glucose, serine, threonine, glycine, formate, histidine and choline 68 . The syntheses of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides require carbon and nitrogen sources, which rely on AA metabolism and the folate cycle in accordance with the energy metabolism and activities of mitochondria 17 . In the folate cycle, THF is an essential factor for nucleotide synthesis and the survival of cancer cells, and formyl-THF serves as one-carbon reserve 68 . Clearly, onecarbon metabolism is essential for multiple physiological processes (Figure 3 ) including nucleotide metabolism (especially purine synthesis), glutathione (synthesized from glutamate, cysteine and glycine) and NAPDH synthesis for antioxidant defense 17, 68 .",

At cell and disease levels, the magnitude of lysine value was demonstrated by that lysine restriction completely blocked the proliferation of cancer cells 7 , and that lysine deficiency caused human childhood malnutrition disease -kwashiorkor 32 ",

As summarized above, different AA restrictions have various effects on cancer cells including proliferation inhibition, metastasis suppression (such as asparagine restriction) 13 Cancer cachexia, a complex metabolic syndrome, was estimated to account for ~20% of the death of cancer patients especially when there was 30% weight loss 90 . It was estimated that ~50-86% of cancer patients would eventually suffer a syndrome of cachexia with anorexia 91 . The levels of AAs were low in cancer cachexia 92, 93 . A standard treatment of patients with cancer cachexia remains elusive 94 , and nutritional interventions lacking standard criteria showed heterogenous and limited beneficial clinical outcomes but some improvements to quality of life 95 . With a bold guess, cancer cachexia is likely a severe type of global AA restriction suffered for a long period, which might be an ultimate strategy used by the own organism of patients to fight cancer. Based on the summarized AA signalling and metabolism, dietary supplements of arginine, methionine and lysine might be particularly important and necessary to stimulate protein synthesis via activating mTOR signalling for cancer cachexia. The supplement or restriction of leucine need careful deliberation because that leucine acts as a key inhibitory signal for food intake, plays an indispensable role in activating mTOR signalling, and is the most enriched AA in degraded and recycled proteins.",

However, according to the latest systematic review and meta-analysis 99 , immunonutrition alone didn't reduce allcause mortality of cancer patients although reduces postoperative infection complications. In 1998, Vanderhoof conjectured the immunomodulatory effects of carbohydrates, which had little attention and few literature at that time 100 . Vanderhoof pointed out that \"most of the nonenergy-related effects of carbohydrates can be related to short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production\". Interesting, in contrast to the inhibition of glutamine-utilized metabolism in cancer cells, activated T cells could adapt to glutamine blockade through the upregulation of acetate metabolism to maintain energy (especially ATP) and NADPH homeostasis 12 . The adaptation capability of T cells suggested that SCFAs (including acetate, propionate and butyrate) could be used for maintaining the metabolism of immune cells under AA restriction, and also provided an explanation to the immunomodulatory effects of carbohydrates, especially oligosaccharides and dietary fiber 100,101 . Most grains (including wheat, rye and barley) contain insoluble fiber, while oats mainly have a soluble fiber in the form of b-glucan 100 . These soluble or insoluble fiber can yield the high production of SCFAs (acetate ~60%) in the caecum and proximal colon 101 . b-glucans, a group of polysaccharides also rich in the cell wall of bacteria and fungi such as mushrooms, have strong immunomodulatory effects in cancer control 102,103,104 . Mushrooms rich in b-glucan also can serve as a source of dietary fiber 105 and for AA restriction (Figure 4B). Mushrooms are used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for centuries. Importantly, TCM demonstrated immunomodulatory effects in the prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) using herbal prescriptions based on the theory (Treatise on Exogenous Febrile Diseases and Miscellaneous Diseases) of Zhongjing Zhang, the father of TCM 106,107 . The TCM prescriptions for SARS prevention might will have therapeutical effects on cancer cachexia since those validated herbal prescriptions of TCM during 2003 SARS outbreak might effectively boost the immune system with a status of natural AA restriction. If necessary, supplement tryptophan, arginine and BH4 with immunotherapies to enhance the proliferation and function of T cells.",

AAs including asparate, glutamine, serine and glycine provide the essential carbon and nitrogen sources for the syntheses of nucleobases 17 . Those carbons and nitrogens highlighted in various colors represent their original sources, such as asparate (brown), glutamine (blue), serine and folate cycle (purple), glycine (green) and bicarbonate radical (tan). B. The proportions of ATP-consuming processes in thymocytes 3 . AA metabolism may use up to ~58% of the total ATP consumption including protein synthesis (~33%) and nucleotide synthesis (~25%). Sestrin-2 and LRS are cytosolic leucine sensors; arginine also has two sensors: a cytosol sensor -CASTOR1 and a lysosomal sensor -SLC38A9; methionine is indirectly sensed by SAM sensor -SAMTOR; Arf-1 relays the glutamine signals for mTORC1 activation. The methionine cycle and folate cycle are two functional modules connected and involved in one-carbon metabolism, which is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, glutathione and NAPDH syntheses. AA deficiency is sensed by GCN2 through binding to uncharged tRNA. GCN2 activation represses the translation of most mRNAs but selectively increases the translation of ATF4/GCN4. IFN-g upregulates the tryptophan-catabolizing activity of IDO, while TGF-b can activate ARG1 in macrophages. The depletion of tryptophan or arginine leads to the proliferative arrest, anergy induction or apoptosis of T cells via GCN2 activation. ATF4 can upregulate AA metabolism including AA synthetases (including asparagine and serine), transporters (such as glutamine) and sensors (sestron-2) for cancer cell proliferation. Those words highlighted in red represent the upregulated biologic processes in cancer cells.

Normal maize used as feedstuffs from Philippines, China and USA are all low in lysine which abundance is about one-sixth of the value in QPM, and tryptophan abundance in normal maize is about half of the value in QPM. The listed starch roots and tubers, vegetables and fruit are all good fit for AA restriction strategies, especially mushrooms like immunonutrition.",
