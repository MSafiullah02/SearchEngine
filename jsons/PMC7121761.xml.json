The index patient had symptom onset on February 19 and worsening respiratory status requiring supplemental oxygen for 5 days before she was transferred to a local hospital on February 24, 2020. At the hospital, she was found to be febrile (temperature as high as 39.6\u00b0C), with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, 83% while she was breathing ambient air). She became more hypoxemic over the next 24 hours, despite bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and was intubated on February 25, 2020, because of respiratory failure. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Her medical history included insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She had no known travel or contact with persons known to have Covid-19.",

Guidance related to self-isolation, self-quarantine, and testing for symptomatic close contacts was provided during interviews, as appropriate.

Nonresponders were sent up to five reminders to complete the survey.15 In addition, countywide databases that capture all emergency medical service transfers from long-term care facilities to acute care facilities were reviewed on a daily basis for evidence of cases or clusters of influenza-like illness. Finally, routine passive surveillance for influenza-like illness clusters in long-term care facilities was used to identify possible Covid-19; reporting is mandated for a confirmed case of influenza or for two or more cases of influenza-like illness in a 72-hour period. All long-term care facilities with evidence of a cluster of respiratory illness were contacted by telephone for additional information, including information on infection-control strategies that were in place and on personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies. On the basis of this information, the long-term care facilities were prioritized according to risk of Covid-19 introduction, and the highest-priority facilities were visited by response personnel to perform diagnostic testing of those with influenza-like illness and to implement infection-control assessment, training, and support.",

Among facility residents, 118 were tested; 101 results were positive and 17 negative. Most affected persons had respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, chart review of facility residents found that in 7 cases no symptoms had been documented. Clinical presentation ranged from mild (no hospitalization) to severe, including 35 deaths by March 18. Reported dates of symptom onset ranged from February 15 to March 13. The median age of the patients was 83 years (range, 51 to 100) among facility residents, 62.5 years (range, 52 to 88) among visitors, and 43.5 years (range, 21 to 79) among facility personnel; 112 patients (67.1%) were women (Table 1). The hospitalization rates for residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. As of March 18, the preliminary case fatality rate was 33.7% for residents and 6.2% for visitors; no staff members had died. Most (94.1% of 101) facility residents had chronic underlying health conditions, with hypertension (67.3%), cardiac disease (60.4%), renal disease (40.6%), diabetes mellitus (31.7%), pulmonary disease (31.7%), and obesity (30.7%) being most common. Of the coexisting conditions evaluated, hypertension was the only underlying condition present in 7 facility residents with Covid-19. The 50 health care personnel with confirmed Covid-19 worked in the following occupational categories: physical therapist, occupational therapist assistant, speech pathologist, environmental care (housekeeping, maintenance), nurse, certified nursing assistant, health information officer, physician, and case manager.",

Of the first 8 facilities affected after Facility A, at least 3 had clear epidemiologic links to Facility A (Figure 2). Two of the facilities with definitive epidemiologic links had staff working both at that facility and at Facility A; the third facility had received two patient transfers from Facility A. Information received from surveys of long-term care facilities and on-site visits identified factors that were likely to have contributed to the vulnerability of these facilities, including staff who had worked while symptomatic; staff who worked in more than one facility; inadequate familiarity with and adherence to PPE recommendations; challenges to implementing proper infection control practices, including inadequate supplies of PPE and other items (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer); delayed recognition of cases because of a low index of suspicion; limited availability of testing; and difficulty identifying persons with Covid-19 on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Examples of specific PPE challenges included an initial lack of available eye protection, frequent changes in PPE types because supply chains were disrupted and PPE was being obtained through various donations or suppliers, and a need for a designated staff member to observe PPE use to ensure that staff were consistent with safe PPE handling (e.g., not touching or adjusting face protection, primarily face masks, during extended use). Working collaboratively, state and local health departments and CDC staff provided five focused PPE trainings for facility staff, including donning and doffing demonstrations and practice, and three additional basic infection control visits, including hand hygiene assessments, audits of PPE use, and reviews of environmental cleaning and disinfection practices.",

In total, 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been identified among residents, personnel, and visitors as of March 18, and 30 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in King County had identified at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. Staff working in multiple facilities while ill and transfers of patients from one facility to another potentially introduced Covid-19 into some of these facilities. The transmission within Facility A and to other facilities in the area posed a serious threat to the medically vulnerable population residing within long-term care facilities and strained the local acute care hospitals. Although the use of vaccine and antiviral medications can be effective in reducing the spread of influenza in long-term care facilities, such interventions are not currently available for Covid-19.18 Residents and health care personnel at long-term care facilities are at risk for Covid-19 transmission and severe outcomes, particularly for residents who are predominantly at advanced ages and have underlying medical conditions. Publicly available information on staffing and quality measures shows no indication that baseline practices at Facility A placed residents at greater risk than residents at other similar facilities.",

Not all residents and staff were interviewed and tested for SARS-CoV-2, which might have led to under-ascertainment of infections, particularly for those who were presymptomatic or asymptomatic. For example, at another facility (Facility B) that had a subsequent Covid-19 outbreak epidemiologically linked to Facility A, swabbing of all residents revealed that infections with low cycle threshold values (indicating a large quantity of viral RNA) occurred among some residents who did not have symptoms.19 There was not a complete roster of visitors to Facility A, and it is possible that some infections among visitors were also missed by these surveillance and investigation efforts. Because symptom onset dates were not available in many cases, the epidemic curve is presented by date of report; however, this does not adequately represent the timing of disease onset in the facility, given that the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis in this cohort was 8 days but had considerable variability. Finally, case ascertainment and testing ramped up after the outbreak was recognized at Facility A, but there could have been infections and transmission at other facilities in the area earlier.",

Substantial disruptions, such as staff absenteeism and increased workload, may affect the consistency with which these practices are implemented and monitored.
