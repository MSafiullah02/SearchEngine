            "text": "Guinea pigs possess a predominantly gram-positive gastrointestinal flora and are exquisitely sensitive to antibiotics, which eradicate that flora. Drugs such as penicillin, ampicillin, chlortetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, and lincomycin will destroy the most susceptible gram-positive organisms, permitting overgrowth of Clostridium difficile and elaboration of its toxin.10, 35 Toxin production causes hyperactivity of secretomotor neurons, resulting in secretory diarrhea and hemorrhagic typhlitis.59 Clinically, the guinea pig has diarrhea and is anorectic, dehydrated, and hypothermic.35 Diagnosis is usually based on history, clinical signs, and lesions, because C. difficile is difficult to isolate. Antibiotic-associated enterotoxemia is treated symptomatically. Supportive therapy includes placing the animal in an incubator or putting its cage on a recirculating water blanket to correct hypothermia. Lactated Ringer's solution or other crystalline fluids should be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously to restore hydration. A daily maintenance dose of 10 mL/100 g should be administered to a dehydrated animal until it is drinking normally. Intestinal microflora can be reestablished by administration of a commercial Lactobacillus product. Alternatively, live-culture yogurt can be given orally at a dosage of approximately 5 mL/day. Although refaunation with rodent fecal slurry has been performed, transfaunation with healthy guinea pig flora has proven to be more successful. Chloramphenicol administered at 50 mg/kg q8h PO may be effective in suppressing further clostridial overgrowth.10\n",

E. coli causes wasting, depression, and death in weanlings. Intestines may contain yellow fluid.27 Antibiotic treatment is based on culture and sensitivity analysis. Supportive therapy is also indicated. Tyzzer's disease, caused by Clostridium piliforme (formerly Bacillus piliformis), has been reported in guinea pigs. The organism is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, and young, stressed animals are particularly affected. Signs of Tyzzer's disease include diarrhea, an unthrifty appearance, and acute death.35 In one case, dependent subcutaneous edema and excessive serous fluid were reported.54 Lesions observed at necropsy include intestinal inflammation and focal hepatic necrosis. Because C. piliforme is an intracellular bacterium, it will not grow on routine culture media. Definitive diagnosis is made at necropsy by identification of the organisms on hematoxylin and eosin\u2013 or silver-stained sections of intestine or liver. Treatment has been unrewarding.

Bordetella antibodies can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by indirect immunofluorescence; however, culture and sensitivity studies should be used to confirm active cases.58 Radiographs may reveal consolidated lung lobes or an opacity in the tympanic bullae. Antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial pneumonia in guinea pigs are chloramphenicol palmitate (30-50 mg/kg PO q12h \u00d7 7-21 days) and trimethoprim-sulfa (30-50 mg/kg PO q12h \u00d7 7 days), and enrofloxacin (5-10 mg/kg q12h \u00d7 7-21 days). A combination therapy using enrofloxacin and doxycycline (2.5 mg/kg PO q12h) for 7-21 days has also been effective. Long-term therapy (4-6 weeks) with any of these antimicrobial agents may be necessary. Trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, is effective against S. pneumoniae and was used successfully to treat experimentally induced Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs.40\nLactobacillus should be given during antibiotic treatment and for approximately 5 days afterward. Supportive care, such as lactated Ringer's solution, oxygen therapy, and vitamin C, can also be given. Good husbandry, avoidance of stress, and separation of guinea pigs from dogs and rabbits will help control pneumonia.",

The bacteria formed nidi around which calcium was deposited, resulting in stone formation.39 Signs of urolithiasis include anorexia, hematuria, dysuria, and a huddled, hunched posture.48 Lesions include hemorrhage or congestion of bladder mucosa, hemorrhagic exudate within the bladder, and calculi adherent to the bladder wall.41\nS. pyogenes causes hyperemia of bladder mucosa and yellowish-gray deposits within the lumen.39 Uroliths can sometimes be palpated; however, definitive diagnosis is most often made by radiography. Urinary acidifiers usually are not indicated because guinea pigs cannot easily remove an acid load.26 Although potassium citrate is sometimes used to help prevent the formation of calculi, the efficacy of this drug has not been proven. In guinea pigs with urethral calculi, retrograde flushing might relieve the obstruction. If this procedure fails or if cystic or ureteral calculi are present, surgery should be considered. Isoflurane or sevoflurane is the anesthetic of choice for guinea pigs. Supportive care for urinary calculi includes antibiotic and fluid therapy.",

Although pregnancy is a contributing factor, toxemia is not limited to females; boars are also susceptible to this disorder. Obesity and fasting are the most critical predisposing conditions. Dietary alterations, environmental changes, and other stressors also play a role in precipitating this disease.18, 35 Onset of signs is abrupt. The guinea pig becomes anorectic, quits drinking, and within 24 hours is prostrate and dyspneic. Convulsions and death can occur within 2 to 5 days. Clinically, the animal is hypoglycemic (less than 60 mg/dL), ketonemic, proteinuric, and aciduric (pH 5-6; normal pH = 9). The liver is enlarged and fatty, and the stomach is empty. In pregnant sows, the heavy, gravid uterus may compress its own vascular supply, resulting in ischemia, thromboplastin release, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.26, 35 Treatment of pregnancy toxemia is usually unrewarding. Keep the guinea pig warm, give fluids intravenously or, if necessary, intraperitoneally, and administer glucose intravenously or by mouth. If the animal is in shock, it also can be treated with corticosteroids and calcium gluconate. Stress of treatment, combined with anorexia and an empty stomach, may lead to a fatal enteritis.26 The prognosis for recovery from pregnancy toxemia is guarded to grave.",

Signs of dystocia include unproductive contractions and straining. Animals may present with depression and may have a bloody or greenish-brown vulvar discharge. Diagnosis is based on history and signs. If the pelvic symphysis is wide enough and the problem is uterine inertia, 0.2 to 3 IU/kg of oxytocin can be given intramuscularly to stimulate contractions.18 If pups are manually extracted, the fetal membranes must be rapidly removed.10 If oxytocin fails to stimulate contractions, or if the pubic symphysis is less than 20 to 25 mm dilated, immediate cesarean section is indicated.18 The female can be given buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg SC q8-12h), followed by isoflurane or sevoflurane via mask induction and maintenance. A standard ventral midline approach is used. The uterus is exteriorized and incised longitudinally. Once the pups are removed, they should be cleaned off and stimulated to breathe immediately. The uterus is closed with an inverted suture pattern. The linea is closed with absorbable suture and the skin with nonabsorbable suture, using a simple interrupted pattern for both closure locations (see Chapter 27). Guinea pigs do not tolerate the stress of anesthesia and surgery well; prognosis is guarded to poor.18 Dystocia is best prevented by breeding guinea pigs before 6 months of age and by preventing obesity.",

Animals with intact nasal and conjunctival mucosa can also develop disease.36 Stress increases susceptibility to infection.26 Clinically, the guinea pig presents with pus-filled ventral cervical masses. Occasionally, bacteria spread systemically, resulting in septicemia or necrotizing bronchopneumonia.31 Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and results of impression smears, Gram stains of the pus, and culture and sensitivity testing. Treatment consists of surgically excising the abscess (preferably) or draining of the abscess and copious flushing of the wound. A systemic antibiotic should be administered.

Areas of hyperkeratosis develop on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the feet. These ulcerate, permitting secondary invasion by Staphylococcus aureus.35 Infection can extend deep into the tissues of the feet, traveling up tendons and into bone, resulting in osteomyelitis. Guinea pigs with pododermatitis are in significant pain, vocalize frequently, and are reluctant to walk. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and identification of lesions. Radiography may be useful in identifying osteomyelitis. Treatment consists of appropriate systemic antibiotics, surgical debridement of lesions, chlorhexidine foot soaks, wound bandaging, and appropriate analgesic therapy. As with pododermatitis in most species, the prognosis is guarded. The disease is best prevented by keeping the environment clean dry; housing the animals on soft, nonabrasive bedding; and avoiding obesity.",
