All eight owe their mechanism of action to hydrogen bondedb ase pairing with either (i)uracil or (ii)cytosine. Four out of the eight compounds (galidesivir, GS-6620, remdesivir and pyrazofurin) are C-nucleosides,a nd two of them (GS-6620, remdesivir) also contain ap hosphoramidate part. The C-nucleoside and phosphoramidate (and for the adenine analogues the 1'-cyano group as well) may be considered as essential attributes for their antiviral activity.",

[2] Ribavirin (Virazole, 1-b-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) ( Figure 1 ) was the first synthetic nucleoside analogue ever reported (in 1972) to be active against ab road spectrumo fb oth RNA and DNA viruses. [3] In their final remarks, Sidwell et al. (1972) stated, rightfully that \"the antiviral spectrum of Virazole was the broadest ever reported for any syntheticm aterial that does not induce interferon\", although the eventual clinicalu se of Virazole would eventually be limited to RNA virus infections.

[6] As originally ascertained for ribavirin, [7] EICAR also provedt ob eapotent inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, thus blocking the biosynthesis of GMP. [8] The depletion of the intracellular GTP and dGTP pools, resulting from the decreased biosynthesis of GMP,m ay also explain variouso ther effects of EICAR, such as its potentiating effect on the anti-HIV activity of ddI (2',3'-dideoxyinosine) [9] and its inhibitory effects on the replication of av ariety of viruses such as the double-stranded RNA virus, IPNV (infectious pancreatic necrosis virus). [10, 11] In the latter publication, yet another antiviralc ompound, pyrazofurin, was mentioned to be as pecific inhibitor or IPNV. [11] Pyrazofurin [3-(b-d-ribofuranosyl)-4-hydroxypyrazole-5-carboxamide] (Figure 1 ) is an inhibitor of OMP decarboxylase, a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine mononucleotide biosynthesis:i th as provent ob ea ctivea gainst both (+ +)RNA viruses [picorna (polio, CoxsackieB 4), toga (sindbis) and flavi (yellow fever)] and (\u00c0)RNA viruses [paramyxo( measles, RSV), orthomyxo (influenza), rhabdo( VSV) and arena (Junin, Tacaribe)]. [4, 12] Pyrazofurinh as been found to be an exquisitely potent inhibitor of VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus), which belongs to af amily (rhabdoviridae), closely relatedt ot he family of the filoviridae to which Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus belong. VSV can be handled in conventionals afety conditions, whereas EBOV and Marburgv irus require biosafety level 4; VSV could therefore be recommended as ap aradigm for predicting antiviral activity against EBOV. [13] Pyrazofurinh as so far not been evaluated for its potentiala ctivity against EBOV;i t should be done so, as has already been done with the neplanocin Aa nalogues. These analogues are knownt ob et argeted at the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. [14] The prototype of this class of compounds is 3-deazaneplanocinA( Figure 1 ). Two decades ago, 3-deazaneplanocin Aw as shownt ob ee ffective against al ethal EBOV infection in mice.

[20] to be activea gainst aw ide range of viruses, including filo-, toga-, bunya-, arena-, paramyxo, corona-, flavi-, orthomyxo-andp icornaviruses. It was found to completely protectc ynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection. [20] It effectively blocked yellow fever virus infection in ah amster model. [21] It is now under development for the treatmento f EBOV infection. [22] BCX4430 (Galidesivir) (Figure 1 ) has also been found effective against Zika virus in cell culture and in a lethal mousem odel. [23] Antivirala ctivity of BCX4430 has also been reported against West Nile virus, at ypical mosquitotransmitted flavivirus, and against tick-bornef laviviruses, Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV). [24] It inhibits infection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), am osquito-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in humansa nd livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, in Syrian golden hamsters. [25] The phosphoramidatep rodrug of the pyrrolo[2,1-f][triazin-4amino]a denine C-nucleoside GS-5734 (Remdesivir) ( Figure 1 ) was first reported to protect 100 %o fE BOV-infected rhesus monkeys against al ethal EBOV infection. [26] It wasa lso found active against other emerging viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hepatitis Cv irus (HCV),a nd the presence of the 1'-cyano group in remdesivir wasf ound to be critical in providing selectivity toward the viral (RNA) polymerases. [27] GS-5734 was then found to be highly inhibitory to various viruses other than filo, that is, pneumo-, paramyxo-and coronaviruses. [28] That GS-5734 inhibited both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses, and might prove effective against emerging coronaviruses in the future was emphasized by Sheahane tal. [29] The viral RNA polymerase and the proofreading exoribonuclease were suggested as being responsible fort he coronavirus susceptibility to remdesivir. [30] The viral RNA polymerase has also been identified as the targete nzyme of paramyxoviruses (i.e. Nipah virus) for the antiviral activity of GS-5734. [31] For both EBOV RNA-dependentR NA polymerase (RdRp) and RSV RdRp, chain termination was delayeda nd predominantly seen at position i + 1. [32] The first newborn baby to have survived congenital EBOV infection, received remdesivir in addition to ZMapp and ab uffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor. [33] Favipiravir (T-705) ( Figure 1 ) is ap yrazine derivative, that is, 6-fluoro-3hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, sharing ac ommon structural feature, that is ac arboxamide entity,w ith ribavirin, EICAR and pyrazofurin, andw hich is also an essential (hydrogen bonding) part of guanine( -HN 1 -C 6 O-). [34, 35] As already mentioned, ribavirin and EICAR would primarily owe their antiviral activity to interference with the IMP dehydrogenase, ak ey enzyme in the biosynthesis of GMP and GTP.Y et, Eriksson et al. [36] reported inhibition of influenzav irus RNA polymerase by ribavirint riphosphate,a nd when Furuta et al. [37] had revealed the in vitro and in vivo activities of T-705 against influenza virus, they attributed the mode of action of T-705 to as pecific inhibition of the influenzavirus RNA polymerase by the T-705 RTP (ribofuranosyl triphosphate. [38] To this end (Scheme 1), T-705 had first to be converted to its ribofuranosyl monophosphate( RMP) by a phosphoribosylt ransferase, and then further processed by kinase(s) to its diphosphate( RDP) and triphosphate (RTP), before the latter would interact in aG TP-competitive manner with the viral RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "That T-705 (Favipiravir), as av iral RNA polymerase inhibitor, offers great potential in the treatment of aw idev ariety of RNA virus infections, has been reviewed repeatedly. [39] [40] [41] [42] Sidwell et al. [43] demonstrated that T-705 inhibited al ethal avian influenza A( H5N1)v irus infectioni nm ice. This was confirmed by Kiso et al.. [44] It was ascertainedt hat in the influenzaA(H5N1) virus-infected cells T-705 was metabolized to T-705 RTP. [45] The latter is incorporated into the nascent RNA strand as ap urine nucleotide analog (reminiscent of GMP) and inhibits strand extension. [46] The RTP of T-705 acts as aG TP-competitive inhibitor of the influenza viral RNA polymerase. [47] Favipiravir inhibits in vitro replication of aw ide range of influenzav iruses, including those resistantt oc urrently available drugs [48] andt hose isolated from patients who had previously received favipiravir. [49] Favipiravir has been approved, as Avigan, in Japan for the treatment of influenza. [50] Lethal mutagenesis hasb een proposed to be ak ey mechanism in the activity of T-705 (Favipiravir) againsti nfluenzaA (H1N1)v iruses in vitro. [51] Lethalm utagenesis has also been suggested for the activity of favipiravir against norovirus repli-cation [52] and hepatitis Cv irus. [53] Such mechanism of antiviral activity was originally proposed for ribavirin. [54, 55] However,t he activity of ribavirin against yellow fever virus could not be explained by an error-prone mechanism. [56] Favipiravir has provene ffective againstv irtually all hemorrhagic fever virus infections:a rena-and bunyaviridae, [57] Pichinde virus (an arenavirus), [58, 59] Lassa fever virus, [60] yellow fever virus, [61] Western Equine encephalitis virus, [62] West Nile virus, [63] Punta To ro, ap hlebovirus, [64] the hantavirus Maporal, [65] Rift Valley Fever virus [Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae)], [66] Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [Nairovirus (Bunyaviridae)], [67] SevereF ever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus (SFTSV), ar ecently identified emerging virus, [68] and norovirus (Caliciviridae). [69, 70] Resistance to T-705 has never been reported, except for Chikungunya virus (Alphaviridae) which acquired resistance due to the K291R mutation in the RNA-dependentR NA polymerase (RdRp). [71] Favipiravir proveds uccessful in the treatment of EBOV infection in mice. [72, 73] In nonhuman primates, treated intravenously with favipiravir,f ive of six animals (83 %) survived al ethal Marburg virus infection. [74] In patients with the EBOV infection in www.chemasianj.org Sierra Leone, favipiravir was found to increase the survival rate from 35.3 %( 30/85) to 56.4 %( 22/39). [75] Another study carried out in Guinea ended with the statement that favipiravir monotherapy merits furthers tudy in patients with mediumt oh igh viremia but not in those with very high viremia. [76] Guedj et al. [77] concluded that favipiravir mayh ave ap otentialr ole at high doses in the treatment of EBOV infections in humans.",
