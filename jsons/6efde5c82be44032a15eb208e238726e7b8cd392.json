A primary concern of epidemiologists is investigating the spread of infectious diseases. Computer Scientists can provide powerful tools for epidemiologists to study such diseases. The existing simulation approaches available to epidemiologists are fast becoming obsolete, with data being stored in newer formats like GIS formats. There is an urgent need for developing computationally powerful, user-friendly tools that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of disease spread. We present a survey of the stateof-the-art in agent-based modeling and discuss the unique features of our chosen technique. Our agent-based approach effectively models the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases in spatially-delineated environments by using agents to model the interaction between people and pathogens. We present preliminary results of modeling an actual tuberculosis disease outbreak in a local shelter. This model is an important step in the development of user-friendly tools for epidemiologists.",

Epidemiologists are primarily concerned with investigating disease outbreaks and risk assessment in spatially delineated environments, investigating vaccination strategies to control the spread. Thorough understanding of the dynamics of disease transmission is key to predicting the spread of a disease and controlling it. Epidemiologists employ various statistical methods to analyze the data relating to a disease, but there are no specific tools that they can use to study a disease, its spread, the spread of the infective agent and other factors. With the emergence of new infectious diseases like Lyme disease, Hepatitis-C, West Nile Virus, and HIV, the need to develop tools that epidemiologists need to study these diseases becomes apparent. As more strains of diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia become resistant to antibiotics, it becomes imperative to track the progression/mutation of these strains. The method of field trials, currently available to epidemiologists, is either prohibitively expensive or unethical. Applying mathematical models and using computers to process the copious amounts of data related to a particular disease outbreak can aid in understanding the dynamics of the disease spread to a certain extent. But, even today, in spite of the availability of computational resources to process the huge data involved, epidemiologists face tough challenges in trying to understand the results obtained by applying the mathematical models and computer programs. Epidemiologists are not trained to understand the intricacies of mathematical theories or the subtleties of computer programs. This is where computer scientists can step in, by harnessing the power of powerful computing resources now available and developing user-friendly tools that epidemiologists can use.",

To meet the increasing demands, the field of Epidemiology is in need of specific computational tools that would enable the professionals to respond promptly and accurately to control and contain disease outbreaks. Increased globalization, highly mobile populations, and possible exposure to infectious diseases pose new public health threats. It is vital to develop new tools that take advantage of today's communication and computing infrastructures.

The results obtained from the processing of the available data are difficult to analyze because of the sheer size of the population involved. In such scenarios, providing visualization tools would allow the scientists to process available data and draw relevant conclusions. For example, consider the critical issue of limiting the spread of an infectious disease in a particular area (city or town, for example). The data immediately available to epidemiologists may include information about the extent of disease spread, the areas the epidemic has spread to and the number of vaccine doses available for immunization. If the number of doses is limited, a decision must be made about vaccination strategies, i.e. what is the optimal way to vaccinate in order to effectively limit the spread of the disease. The goal is to provide epidemiologists simulation tools that will allow them to analyze the effect of various immunization strategies to derive an optimal strategy for immunization with the available resources. For example, they may arrive at the conclusion that ring vaccination, i.e. vaccinating in the area of 1 mile radius around the infected area, will contain the spread of the disease.",

Other modeling paradigms, such as agent-based modeling and stochastic cellular automata, can now be applied to epidemiology since we can use available data sets in the form of GIS data and large computer databases. The SARS outbreak was a global outbreak, whereby the disease that originated in a remote part of China spread rapidly to other parts of the world like Toronto. Global outbreaks of diseases are dependent on a number of factors like demography, geography and culture of a region, socioeconomic factors, and travel patterns. Local disease outbreaks, on the other hand, are outbreaks of diseases in spatially delineated areas like factories, homeless shelters. The spread of the disease is thus dependent on airflow rates, heating and cooling, the architectural properties of the delineated space, and social and spatial interactions.",

Modeling global outbreaks is a particularly challenging task for which stochastic cellular automata are a useful modeling tool.

For example, if we are trying to model humans with desires to smoke and to drink, we associate with each an agent, with variables representing their present level of desire to smoke or drink. When its desire level hits a threshold, an agent will perform an action, such as moving toward the smoking or toward the drinking fountain. Figure 1 shows the desire levels as a function of time and threshold values. Now when the desire level reaches the threshold, the agent, which is in the area A in Figure 1 tries to move towards the area D, here it can quench its thirst. In order to move toward the destination D from the source A, we can design a Source/Destination routing table which will help the agent move in the right direction and reach the destination with least effort.

It was a leading cause of death in the 19 th century. It spreads through the air, with the bacilli having a settling rate of 3 feet/hour. The tuberculosis bacilli reside in the lungs, so the immune system responds quickly to the infection. Most infected individuals never develop TB, i.e. they never become infectious. Most exposed individuals remain \"latent-for-life,\" but around 10 percent of those exposed become infectious. The reasons that TB persists in the United States are co-infection with HIV/AIDS, lack of public knowledge about transmission and treatment, and immigration, which accounts for a large number of new cases. We propose to model the dynamics of an outbreak that occurred in 2000 to model the spread of infection from patient zero to other infected individuals. Using agent-based modeling, we can simulate the outbreak and study the transmission patterns unique to this setting. We model the layout of the homeless shelter and the interacting entities.

People ocassionally wake up during the night to smoke, congregating in that We use different colors (not shown in Figure 4 ) to represent people in various stages of infection and resistance to tuberculosis. For example, green dots are used to denote healthy people, people who are immune (already immunized) are represented using black, and red is used to represent the infected people. The people, represented as agents, move about randomly in the homeless shelter. Whenever they approach a bed or mat, they may choose to sleep on it for a random amount of time. The amount of time an agent rests on a bed or a mat can be varied in order to simulate the different behaviors of the people. For example, there is more interaction among people during the daytime hours than in the nighttime hours. Accordingly, the agents linger on the beds or mats for a longer time when we want to simulate the nighttime behavior. In our model, the days and nights continue in a cycle until we stop the simulation.",

In this model we have one slider to indicate the total number of people in the homeless shelter before we start to run the simulation, the number of initially infected people, number of initially immune people, the death rate and the recovery rate. The model allows us to drag on the sliders, increasing and decreasing the functional parameters to engage in a what-if analysis and arrive at useful conclusions about the transmission of infection among the population.",

Recently, attention has also shifted towards bio-terrorist attacks. In such cases, it becomes imperative to understand the social network and its behavior in order to understand the spread of the disease. Once sufficient knowledge about the social groups of the network is established, multi-agent simulations help in modeling and analyzing the risk of disease spread through socially connected groups. In order to do so, we first have to understand the characteristics of the social group, the disease, and the environmental factors that affect the spread of the disease.",

This helps in analyzing the risk of propagation, the spread of propagation, and the medium of propagation, and helps in mitigating the risk of such spreads or, in some cases, totally eradicating the disease through immunization strategies or other measures. Being able to do so would take the epidemiologists a step further in the way of analyzing disease outbreaks and the spread of epidemics. The results of the simulations and the associated graphs can help to improve understanding of the dynamics of transmission and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of disease spread.",
