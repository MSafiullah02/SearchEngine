            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) [1]. The disease was reported for the first time in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 and spread to several countries in Africa, Asia, Americas and Europe [2, 3]. The capability of human-to-human transmission has been observed in at least four hospital settings [4\u20137]. Significantly, MERS-CoV shares certain similarities with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV that produced a global epidemic with more than 8000 human cases in 2002\u20132003 [8, 9]. First, a number of patients infected with both viruses developed an acute respiratory disease that in some cases resulted in death [7, 9]. In this sense, MERS-CoV appears to be highly pathogenic with an estimated case-fatality rate of around 50%, although this might be an overestimation as many infected patients may not have sought hospital assistance [2]. Second, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and are closely related to coronaviruses isolated from bats [10\u201312]. This strongly suggests that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may have been transmitted from bats to humans through intermediate species (e.g. camels for MERS-CoV and civet cats for SARS-CoV). Third, since they are new emerging viruses, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral treatments. The SARS epidemic is a clear example of how a networked health system can respond to a new threat to human health.",

The outbreak began in mid-February caused by an infected person who travelled from Guangdong to Hong Kong [13]. An important fact in the generation of a model of the outbreak is that the Hong Kong health authorities quickly implemented contagion control procedures [14]. In general, two interventions were introduced to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV. The first was implementation of quarantine measures to isolate healthy people who had been in contact with infected people and therefore potentially in contact with the virus; isolating those that could be infected and asymptomatic during the incubation period and isolating and treating patients who had developed the disease. The other intervention was the application of protective measures by healthy people who were in contact with infected people to avoid becoming infected, such as respiratory protection for healthcare workers and daily disinfection of the environment of affected rooms [14]. These control interventions were implemented progressively in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from mid-March to late April [15]. The application of these procedures allowed the rapid control of the outbreak in the subsequent months. In this sense, it is estimated that the epidemic in Hong Kong ended in late June.",

In addition, disease epidemiology has been studied using this approach, whereby system dynamics offers the practical application of concepts by computerized models that allow the systematic test of different scenarios and alternative policies [17\u201319]. In this work, we performed a modelling of the Hong Kong SARS-CoV outbreak using system dynamics. The developed model contains five states, four flows, eight auxiliary variables and six parameters that interact through five differential and 12 algebraic equations. The parameters of the model were optimized following an iterative process of simulation to obtain a model that largely fits the data available to the epidemic. Moreover, the credibility of our model and its parameters are supported by both univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses. The model reproduces how the implementation of control measures was effective in preventing the spread of infection to the rest of the population. Basically, these measures result in a sustained reduction in the frequency of contacts. At present, the application of similar measures for infection containment can help to prevent the spread of new emerging epidemics, such as the outbreak caused by MERS-CoV.",

This model is based on two assumptions. First, the individuals are classified into five subgroups (susceptible, latent, infected, recovered, dead). Although, the last subgroup is not strictly needed, it is used to keep an account of those dead. Second, every day there is a different number of people: who are infected without symptoms of the disease (incidence); who develop signs and symptoms of the illness (sick per day); who recover from the disease (daily recovered), and who die (daily deaths) as consequence of the outbreak.",

These equations involve three stocks (susceptible, latent, infected), three auxiliary variables (prevalence, contagion rate, recovery rate) and three parameters (incubation period, case fatality, disease duration). For instance, the incidence flow is proportional to the number of susceptible people, the prevalence and the contagion rate.

We assumed that: (1) the control measures gave, as consequence, a marked reduction of daily contacts in Hong Kong; (2) the control measures were based on the cumulative attack rate, measured as the ratio between cumulative cases and total population [Table 3, equation (6)]. Therefore, we decided to use the frequency of contacts as the daily contacts modulated by the repression Hill function (Fig. 3), in accordance with the equation (7) of Table 3. Despite the complexity level of biological systems several cases have been modelled using the Hill function, in order to simulate repressor activities of enzymatic reactions and the regulation mechanisms of several transcription factors [21]. In our model this repressor function allows the establishment of the relationship between frequency of contacts and the cumulative attack rate. Note that the cumulative attack rate is used as an active repressor, so half-maximal repression occurs when the cumulative attack rate is equal to the threshold, and almost total repression occurs when this cumulative attack rate is double the threshold.\n",

A previous work showed that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across the different European countries analysed in that study even though the average number of contacts recorded differed. Interestingly, the authors suggests that the results may well be applicable to other countries with similar social structures, and that the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection in susceptible populations, such as SARS was in 2003, is likely to be very similar [30]. During the SARS outbreak, health authorities, hospitals, and the overall population progressively implemented quarantine and protection policies to prevent the transmission of the disease [15]. With this in mind, we made the assumption that the intervention of the health authorities caused a decrease in the frequency of contacts, which in turn led a decrease in the rate of contagion. To mimic this event in our model, the number of daily contacts is regulated by means of a repression Hill function, which has been used to simulate repressor activities in complex biological systems [21].",

Several works have estimated that prior to the first global alert the basic reproductive number for SARS was >1, correlating with an exponential increase in the number of cases. However, the implementation of effective control measures, such as quarantine, isolation, and strict hygiene practice in hospitals led a sudden decrease in R0 [14, 31]. The fact that, in our model, R0 drops to values <1 around the date of the global alert reinforces the idea that a decrease in the frequency of contacts is able to effectively simulate the effects of the control measures established in the first stages of the epidemic. It is important to note that estimations of R0 in previous publications are considerably lower (around 2\u20134) than ours, which is almost 12 at the beginning of the outbreak [14, 31, 42]. Nevertheless, the estimated value of R0 also differs in these works and the credible intervals surrounding these deterministic estimations were wide, reaching superior values of almost 8. This high variability can be explained in part by the superspreading events that occurred in SARS epidemics. Superspreading is an unusual situation, in which a single individual directly infects a large number of other people that has a large influence on the early course of the epidemic [42]. Interestingly, the fact that our model does not explicitly account these events could partially explain the very high estimated value of R0 at the beginning of the outbreak.",

Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is a powerful tool to analyse the influence of certain decision making in the evolution of the epidemic. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that our model, together with other system dynamics models can be used by epidemiologists to investigate the likely consequences of future re-emergences of SARS-CoV based on analysis of the previous known epidemics. In addition, by adapting the key parameters of these models or with a little change in the model structures, they can be used to face emerging outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the recent MERS-CoV epidemic. In this regard, there are several similarities and differences which should be taken into account when using this model. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may cause severe respiratory failure, extrapulmonary features such as diarrhoea and also mild or asymptomatic cases. In contrast with SARS, MERS has lower human-to-human transmission potential, affects predominantly older people with more comorbid illness and has a higher case-fatality rate [44]. These factors would affect the output of the model variables (e.g. epidemic curve, cumulative cases, number of dead, etc.).",
