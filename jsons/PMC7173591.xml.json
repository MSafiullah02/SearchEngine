            "text": "\nWine and its association with food encompass an incredible panoply of literature. Amazingly, almost none of its views and assumptions have come under scientific scrutiny. Only a few research papers deal with the topic. This may relate to the separation of enology and food science into separate departments. Also, the funding is different. That for enology and viticulture comes largely from governments and/or levies on vineyards and wineries. Funding in the food sciences comes largely from commercial firms, much of it done internally by food companies and proprietary. Funding from disparate industries provides little incentive for collaboration on interdisciplinary projects, such as food and wine combination.",

Thus, in a field with little scientific rigor, but abundant imagination, opinion and instant experts, it is with some trepidation that I enter what has been largely considered an esthetic topic. This is especially so since scientists tend to be doubters; the issue is highly complex (controls difficult); experimental conditions make their relevance to \u2018real life\u2019 situations dubious; social pressures for conformity among consumers are often pronounced; and the context of the table often puts reality, and its perception, in conflict. Consequently, what I am about to say will likely not be taken with appreciation by the majority in the restaurant or retail wine trades. Nonetheless, fools, prophets (and occasionally scientists) often go where angels fear to tread. The author has already dared to comment on this topic at greater length in another work (Jackson, 2009). His head has a yet to roll, so one more, foreshortened, sortie into the topic may still be safe, buried as it is within a scientific text. It is added to give food for thought to those seriously interested in wine, and how it is most commonly used (or at least portrayed) in society.",

However, when one searches for the evidence, it seems to be a myth \u2013 a view that has been so oft repeated as to be assumed to be true, an example of social contagion of collective memory. The food/wine association only begins to appear in the literature during ancient Greek or Roman times. In the Near East and Egypt, wine was almost the exclusive preserve of the noble or priestly classes. The alcoholic beverage of the populace was beer. Wine is mentioned in the Bible, but seemingly recommended only in relation to religious ceremonies and weddings. It is only in regions where wild grapes grow indigenously that vines came to provide the drink for the masses. Its acidity, alcohol, and phenolic contents all enhanced its antimicrobial property, making it considerably safer to drink than water. This property of wine became increasingly important as population numbers grew, and hygienic conditions correspondingly deteriorated. Although production was seasonal (unlike beer based on a dry grain), its resistance to spoilage for several months, isolated from air, permitted it to become the preferred beverage where vines grew readily. Like beer, it could wash down food, and obliterate, for a short period, the afflictions of rigorous lives. Although safe and nutritious (caloric), there is nothing in its attributes that inherently makes wine ideal as a food beverage. It is actually better suited for its ancient secondary role, as a solvent in preparing extracts from medical herbs.",

The frequent presence of pitch is also less than appealing. The quality of the ordinary wine for the average Roman is probably best left to the imagination. Apparently, finer wines were available for the patrician classes. The most famous seem to have been, or became, concentrated, with aged versions being almost syrup-like. Nonetheless, several Roman poets eulogize the wonders of particular vintages, as do modern writers. Does this mean that ancient wines could be of equivalent quality, or at least acceptable to modern tastes? Probably some would have been, but it\u2019s likely most were simply the habitual everyday beverage.",

            "text": "Even modern wines, with their predominant acidic, bitterish, and astringent character have little to suggest food compatibility. These characteristics are simply the natural consequence of grape chemistry, not conscious intent. Admittedly, consuming wine with food does mollify its less pleasant aspects, unless one develops an appreciation for sour beverages with a bitter/astringent aspect. Some humans seem adept at coming to appreciate and crave what is initially abhorrent. Black coffee, capsicum peppers, and limberger cheese are classic examples. The mutual tapering of the sensation of both cheese and wine appears to be the major benefit of their combination at wine tastings (Nygren et al., 2002, Nygren et al., 2003a, Nygren et al., 2003b). Other studies have confirmed these findings, as well as lending support to the idea that red wines marginally pair better with cheeses, with astringency being reduced and the perception of tannins appearing more silky (Bastian et al., 2010). The bitterness-reducing aspect of cheese, which varies with the type of cheese and bitter tastant, appears to relate at least partially to its fatty acid content (Homma et al., 2012). For example, oleic acid binds quinine, reducing its bitterness. In addition, some combinations fare worse, for example, pairing sweet wines with cheese (Bastian et al., 2009).",

However, iron is considered to induce the fishy aftertaste associated with some white wines paired with seafood (Tamura et al., 2009). In most \u2018compatible\u2019 combinations, both the cheese and wine appear better \u2013 not by enhancing their respective qualities, as usually interpreted, but by a mutual suppression of their less pleasing attributes. For example, the fatty acids in cheese, by coating taste receptors, reduce their exposure to wine acids and phenolics. Lipoproteins, typically found in foods, are known to react with hydrophobic regions of receptor membranes, suppressing the perception of bitterness (Katsuragi et al., 1995). Suppression of unpleasantness of either component could easily be misinterpreted as an enhancement in pleasure \u2013 equating to compatibility. Similar situations could explain many other supposedly compatible food and wine associations. This is not what wine pundits and sommeliers profess, but seems far closer to the truth.\n",

This can be of value when wine is used as a marinade, promoting acid-induced hydrolysis of food proteins. As a marinade, wine antioxidants can also reduce the production of toxic heterocyclic amines during frying (Viegas et al., 2012). Otherwise, sourness is rare as a principal element in most world cuisines (see Moskowitz et al., 1975 for a marked exception). Acids typically are added only as a component in some condiments or flavorants, notably vinegar, lemon juice, or tamarind. They can enhance the flavor of otherwise bland foods. The bitterness and astringency of most red wines also finds no equivalent in meat or fish. Taking food with wine does, however, reduce both its sour and bitter/astringent attributes. The protein in solid food reacts with both wine acids and phenolics, limiting their availability to react with and stimulate gustatory receptors and trigeminal nerve endings.",

Sodium chloride is effective at concentrations considerably lower than sugar (Nakamura et al., 2002). Sugar is used extensively today to mask bitterness in modern beverages. Bitterness suppression appears to be one of the principal \u2018flavor-enhancing\u2019 aspects of adding salt to food. It might also explain the seemingly odd recommendation for adding seawater to wine by the Ancient Greeks \u2013 producing an esteemed wine called oenos thalassikos (see Younger, 1966). Pliny notes in Historia Naturalis (14.120) that salt enhanced the smoothness of wines. In addition, Columella recommends the addition of salt (De Res Rustica 12.41), apparently to avoid moldy tastes. Seawater was part of a recipe mentioned by Columella in preparing \u2018Greek\u2019 wine. Salt water was even recommended in preparing new barrels to receive wine in the recent past (N\u00e8gre and Fran\u00e7ot, 1955). Glutamate and adenosine monophosphate, activators of umami receptors, can also suppress the perception of bitterness (Keast, 2008). Both are typical constituents of meat and cheese.",

If this view has a physicochemical basis, the partial fat solubility of ethanol may reduce the oily mouth-feel of fats, as well as limit the activation of taste receptors to fatty acids, but this is no more than speculation. The acids in wine might also have a similar effect. In addition, wine tannins might denature the G protein receptors responsible for detecting fatty acids in the oral epithelium (see Chapter 11), giving the impression of less fattiness. Conversely, fatty acids can reduce sensitivity to the sourness of organic acids and bitterness of some tastants (Mattes, 2007), possibly improving mouth-feel.",

            "text": "When comparing the sapid profiles of food and wine, there appears to be little similarity. In contrast, there is extensive incongruity. Wine possesses gustatory attributes predominantly characterized as sour, bitter, astringent, and burning. In contrast, solid foods are variously distinguished by sweet, salty, savory (glutamate), and sebaceous (fatty acids) sensations. Sour, bitter, astringent, and spicy hot attributes are (or have been) less common in Western cooking, and then usually in condiments. The inherent, aversive reactions to such sensations probably arose during evolution, to avoid or limit the consumption of potentially toxic and rotten foods. Conversely, these compounds were probably selected during plant evolution to discourage their consumption, with the predominate exception being ripe fruit. During domestication, crop variants were selected with reduced aversive and enhanced pleasant tasting constituents. Thus, lettuce and other vegetables became less bitter; apples, cherries, and other fruits sweeter and less sour or astringent; citrus fruit less acidic; and legumes less flatulent. Cooking further facilitated these actions by inactivating or facilitating the removal of potential food toxins and anti-metabolites. Examples include mycotoxins in fungi, alkaloids in potatoes, and cyanogenic glycosides in casava. Cooking meat also facilitates digestion (collagen and protein fiber breakdown) and enhances flavor. Disappointingly, some cooking processes generate their own toxins, notably roasting and searing. Examples are acrylamide (a Maillard by-product), and a variety of toxic, pyrolytic, smoke by-products. Fermentation is another ancient technique that helped destroy anti-metabolites. For example, Rhizopus oligosporus, used in the production of tempeh, degrades the compounds that induce flatulence in soybeans. Lactobacillus can also destroy soy saponins. Fermentation also has the potential to break down difficult-to-digest oligosaccharides, and help preserve perishable foodstuffs.",

The \u2018apple\u2019 in Chardonnay wine may go well with chicken, the \u2018pepper\u2019 of a Shiraz pair with pepper steak, and the \u2018walnut\u2019 of some sherries combine with nut-containing salads (without vinaigrette). However, does the box wood or cat urine of Sauvignon blanc, the rose of Riesling, and the blackcurrant of Cabernet Sauvignon wines really match with any main course? In addition, does the vanilla/coconut of oak, or the leather aspect of aged red wines have any inherent compatibility with food? The supposed spiciness of Gew\u00fcrztraminer wines is given as a reason for its combination with spicy Asian foods. However, the wine has more litchi aroma than spiciness, making the stated logic dubious. It is only its potential intense aroma that may permit its presence to remain noticeable. Personally, the best aspect of wine and food association is not their complementary natures but their contrasts. Each cleanses the palate between alternate samplings, allowing fresh perceptions of each. Thus, wine permits swift shifts in savory sensuality.",

Is its only justification the reduction of undesirable aspects of the partnership, and as a palate cleanser? Certainly, wine\u2019s ability to partially rinse the palate between food samples is important. It offers both gustatory, olfactory, and trigeminal receptors time to reestablish their native receptive state, countering adaptation and loss of sensory appeal. Thus, food appreciation is enhanced by being sampled afresh. Wine can, unromantically, be viewed as a savory mouthwash. In addition, volatility of food and wine flavorants is influenced by the dynamically changing concentrations of ethanol, phenols, carbohydrates, etc. supplied with the wine. Conversely, food dilutes, masks, and eliminates most wine flavors. The result being that the next sample can be appreciated to its full, adaptation having been avoided.",

It is not lack of flavor subtlety that denies these experiences from the great unwashed. Admittedly, as noted in Chapter 11, there is an incredible range in human sensory sensitivity, with those having higher than average acuity tending to prefer milder favored foods, and those with below average acuity tending to prefer more intensely flavored foods. But, these are no more than tendencies, with experience and social pressures capable of inducing significant shifts in preference, if not perception. Psychological influences and a desire to be influenced can distort perception, creating impressions that are \u2018real,\u2019 only because of the conditions under which the experience occurred. The more unexpected and astounding the sensation, the stronger the memory trace created. The more the mind is studied, the more we come to realize how the brain can distort perception.

Thus, it is wise to doubt perceptions and attempt to separate experience-based memory patterns from actuality, unless it is a selective choice to allow the mind to deceive us.",

Time has only augmented our understanding of the multifaceted nature of this Dr Jekyll\u2013Mr Hyde phenomenon. It is clear that excessive alcohol consumption, both acute and chronic, can have devastating effects on physical and mental well-being. Abusive ethanol consumption can cause cirrhosis of the liver, increase the likelihood of hypertension and stroke, favor the development of breast and digestive tract cancers, and induce fetal alcohol syndrome. Many of these effects may stem from the activation of free-radical damage induced by high alcohol intake (Meagher et al., 1999). Others may arise indirectly, via the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a major breakdown product of ethanol metabolism (Lachenmeier et al., 2009). Because the problems associated with alcoholism (Abrams et al., 1987, Schmitz and Gray, 1998), and its eventual, irreversible, chemical modifications in the brain (Nestler and Malenka, 2004, Heinz, 2006), have been well documented, they will not be discussed here. On the other hand, it is becoming equally clear that moderate wine consumption (up to about one-third of a 750-ml bottle per day) can potentially have health benefits. This is considerably less than the two bottles that Brillat-Savarin (1848) considered a healthy man could consume per day and live long; or the amounts considered appropriate in times past (Younger, 1966, pg 367). Mark Twain expressed moderation best in his expression:\u201cTemperate temperance is best,\u201d from Notebook, 1896.\n",

Ancient Greek and Roman society used wine extensively as a solvent for herbal infusions. This practice continued largely unabated until the beginning of the twentieth century. The excessive abuse of distilled alcoholic beverages, combined with religious and political conservatism, created a backlash against all beverages containing alcohol, notably in North America. Alcohol was viewed as an agent of corruption to be annihilated. Following the failure of Prohibition, humans themselves, not alcohol, came to be viewed as the source of iniquity. Alcoholism is now appropriately viewed as a developmental, multistage, chronic dependence, possessing a complex etiology (Nurnberger and Bierut, 2007), with both genetic and environmental aspects. In this regard, it is similar to other addictions (Ersche et al., 2012). Thus, the social climate is changing, and the relationship between wine (as opposed to alcohol) and health is again being reassessed, and finally investigated seriously.",

The primary, constitutive mechanism involves the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, through the action of cytoplasmic alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Of the seven known ADH genes (Crabb et al., 2004), three function in the liver. The others act in the gastric epithelium and other tissues. Subsequent oxidation converts acetaldehyde to acetic acid. This occurs principally under the action of mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). Cytoplasmic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) is less active. Acetic acid may be released into the blood or converted to acetyl CoA. From this point, metabolism may flow along any standard biochemical pathway (see Fig. 7.20).",

Some of the isozymes possess distinct physiological attributes. For example, ADH1B*1 codes for an isozyme subunit that oxidizes ethanol slowly, whereas ADH1B*2 encodes for a highly active subunit of the dimeric enzyme (about 30 times more efficient) (Thomasson et al., 1995). Correspondingly, those individuals who are homo- or heterozygous for the ADH1B*2 subunit, eliminate alcohol from their blood more rapidly. Rapid alcohol oxidation may donate a degree of protection against alcoholism, by quickly converting ethanol to acetaldehyde. Such individuals tend to consume less alcohol and show more rapid and marked negative consequences to alcohol consumption (headaches and hangovers) than do those metabolizing alcohol more slowly (Wall et al., 2005). This \u2018protection\u2019 is apparently enhanced when combined with slow-acting alleles for acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) (Crabb et al., 2004). Although viewed as a beneficial trait, rapid alcohol degradation probably reduces some of the health benefits of ethanol consumption. Slow acetaldehyde metabolism also appears to predispose individuals for cancers of the oropharynx and esophagus.",

This coincides with activation of the microsomal ethanol oxidation pathway that generates toxic free-oxygen radicals. In the absence of sufficient glutathione, free-oxygen radicals can accumulate, disrupting mitochondrial function. Elsewhere in the body, acetaldehyde can bind with proteins and cellular constituents, forming stable complexes (Niemela and Parkkila, 2004). These can lead to the production of immunogenic determinants, which can stimulate antibody production against acetaldehyde adducts. This may induce some of the chronic tissue damage associated with alcohol abuse (Niemela and Israel, 1992). The binding of acetaldehyde to the plasma membrane of red blood cells is known to increase rigidity. By limiting their ability to squeeze through the narrowest capillaries, oxygen supply to tissue cells may be restricted. This could participate in suppressed brain function. It is estimated that the brain consumes up to 20% of the blood\u2019s oxygen supply, but constitutes only about 2.5% of body mass.",

For example, tannins and phenolic acids can interfere with the action of certain digestive enzymes, notably \u03b1-amylase, lipase and trypsin (Rohn et al., 2002, Gu et al., 2011). Digestion may be further slowed by phenolics polymerizing with food proteins. These effects may be mollified by the presence of ionic carbohydrates commonly found in food (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011), as well as by salivary proteins. Both monomers and proanthocyanidins bind with basic, proline-rich, and histatin proteins in the saliva. Their bonding is reversible, depending on equilibrium conditions. They can become irreversible, though, in the presence of metal ions, upon oxidation, or with pH changes (Luck et al., 1994). Normally, these insoluble saliva/tannin complexes remain stable in the stomach and upper alimentary tract (Lu and Bennick, 1998). Thus, the potential of tannins to inactivate digestive enzymes or disrupt mineral uptake can be reduced. Degradation of these complexes, and their moieties, subsequently occurs in the colon. In contrast, pepsin-activated protein breakdown is activated by monomeric phenolics, such as quercetin, resveratrol, catechin, and epigallocatechin gallate (Tagliazucchi et al., 2005). Clearly the issue is complex and much more needs to be known. Not only are the effects potentially different in the stomach and small and large intestines, but, also, phenolic chemistry changes during passage through the digestive tract.",

This proportion increases when jointly consumed with food, but it is spread over a much longer period. This results primarily by food retarding gastric emptying. Consequently, alcohol transfer into the intestines is delayed. This gives the liver more time to metabolize the ethanol being absorbed, lowering the maximal blood alcohol levels reached. However, taking sparkling wine on an empty stomach increases short-term alcohol uptake by about 35% (Ridout et al., 2003). Because the same wine, with its carbon dioxide removed, did not have the same influence, it is suspected that carbon dioxide was the active ingredient. It has occasionally been proposed that carbon dioxide relaxes the pyloric sphincter, allowing earlier transfer of fluids from the stomach into the duodenum, and thereby its absorption into the blood.",

This significantly limits their uptake in the stomach and small intestine. Passage through the stomach does not modify the majority of wine phenolics. Amongst flavonoids, anthocyanins appear to be those that most quickly traverse the stomach and pass into the blood (Passamonti et al., 2003). They are also effectively translocated across the wall of the small intestine (Talav\u00e9ra et al., 2005). Phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid (Simonetti et al., 2001), and resveratrol (Soleas et al., 2001) also readily pass into the plasma via the intestinal tract. In contrast, flavonoid polymers tend to remain in the intestine, until degraded to phenolic acids and aldehydes by bacteria in the colon (large intestine) (Aura, 2008; Fig. 12.3\n). Also metabolized in the colon are any anthocyanins or catechins monomers that have not already been absorbed and/or microbially degraded. For example, gallotannins are microbially converted to urolithins (Truchado et al., 2012b). Although these by-products have little antioxidant action, they do have anticancer effects and can have beneficial effects on intestinal inflammatory disease (Gim\u00e9nez-Bastida et al., 2012). This may be a consequence of tannin metabolites enhancing the growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp., or attachment, similar to that of flavan-3-ols (Bustos et al., 2012). Depending on the specific compound, variable amounts are absorbed into the blood via the colon (Ward et al., 2004).",

Although many simple flavonoids may be quickly absorbed into the plasma, most appear to be rapidly conjugated, that is, methylated, sulfated, transformed to glucuronides, or otherwise metabolized (see Williams et al., 2004, Forester and Waterhouse, 2009). Hydroxycinnamic acids are also rapidly absorbed and metabolized into glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (Nardini et al., 2009). This both reduces their toxicity (potential carcinogenicity) as well as facilitates their excretion by the kidneys. However, the latter reduces their potential beneficial effects. Small amounts of tartaric acid esters of cinnamic acids are also found in the plasma. These transformations could significantly affect their antioxidant and other attributes, as well as their ability to move into tissue cells and their surrounding fluids.",

Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that phenolic metabolites act primarily as signaling molecules, notably in oxygen-stress-related pathways (Williams et al., 2004). Correspondingly, smaller amounts of active ingredients are needed for activation than for direct antioxidant reactions. This might explain the discrepancy between the low levels of free phenolics in the plasma and their apparent effects. An example may be the increased activity and gene expression of antioxidant genes in erythrocytes after red wine consumption (Fern\u00e1ndez-Pach\u00f3n et al., 2009). Even survival of most of these metabolites in the plasma is comparatively short (a few hours). Their breakdown products rapidly appear in urine shortly after plasma uptake. Future studies are needed to investigate the antioxidant efficacy of phenolic metabolites and their conjugated complexes at concentrations found in the plasma. Their efficacy at binding to, and translocation into tissue cells needs to be known.",

Nevertheless, alcohol is not particularly antimicrobial, certainly at the concentrations found in wine (its sterilant action is optimal at about 70%). Thus, the antibiotic action of wine results primarily from other constituents, probably its phenolic content. Modification of anthocyanins during fermentation increases their toxicity to viruses, protozoans, and bacteria. Other phenolic compounds, typical of red wines, are also bacteriostatic and fungistatic. For example, p-coumaric acid is particularly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus; whereas other phenols inhibit Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia, Shigella, Proteus, and Vibrio (Masquelier, 1988). The latter cause serious forms of diarrhea and dysentery. Phenolics may also be inhibitory to intestinal pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides (Lee et al., 2006). Despite wine being more effective than mildly antimicrobial agents, such as bismuth salicylate (Weisse et al., 1995), full action may take several hours (M\u00f8retr\u00f8 and Daeschel, 2004, Dolara et al., 2005).",

Claudication is a common indicator of peripheral arterial disease. Recent studies have confirmed that incidental factors, such as gender, race, lifestyle, educational level, etc. do not affect these results (see Mukamal et al., 2006). Studies have also demonstrated that daily consumption of alcohol significantly reduces the incidence of other forms of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension (Keil et al., 1998), heart attack (Gaziano et al., 1999), stroke (Truelsen et al., 1998, Hillbom, 1999), and peripheral arterial disease (Camargo et al., 1997).

Because of the hydrophobic nature of cholesterol and triglycerides, their transfer in the plasma requires a special transport vehicle. As illustrated in Fig. 12.6\n, lipoprotein complexes consist of an outer membrane of phospholipids, in which apoproteins and free cholesterol occur. They enclose a hydrophobic core possessing numerous triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. The specific apoproteins in the complex regulate the metabolism of the associated lipids.",

However, in high concentrations, they may accumulate in the artery wall. If they remain there for an extended period, their lipid content tends to become oxidized. In an oxidized state, lipids are cytotoxic and indirectly irritate the artery wall. As a consequence, special adhesion proteins attach to the artery wall. Monocytes and helper T-cells of the immune system bond to these proteins. In addition, affected endothelial cells may secrete compounds, such as endothelin-1. Endothelin-1 activates the migration of monocytes and T-cells into the artery wall. Procyanidins, principally found in red wines, are particularly effective in suppressing the production of endothelin-1 (Corder et al., 2001). In the layer just underneath the endothelial lining (intima), accumulated monocytes mature into macrophages. Both macrophages and T-cells may release a range of cytokines that further activate the immune system, involving localized inflammation. Activated macrophages tend to engulf oxidized LDLs. However, as the LDLs are not degraded, their progressive accumulation gives the macrophage the appearance of being full of bubbles. This has given rise to the term foam cells. They are the first clear evidence of the beginning of localized arterial swelling (plaques). Occasionally plaques bulge into the vessel. More frequently, they initially enlarge outward into the surrounding tissue. Action of immune cells in the plaque also induces migration of smooth muscle cells from the artery wall into the intima. Here they proliferate and produce collagen, forming a fibrous cap over the plaque. Additional LDLs slowly collect, provoking further rounds of inflammation and plaque enlargement. These accretions may develop their own vasculature, becoming fibrous and inelastic. As the plaques enlarge, they may produce irregular protrusions into and block the artery lumen.\n",

For example, collagenases secreted by macrophages inhibit collagen synthesis by smooth muscle cells. Sudden rupture of a plaque permits blood infiltration into the plaque.

Part of the reversal process involves the action of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Of the two principal forms, ethanol augments the presence of HDL3, whereas exercise increases the level of HDL2. The effect of ethanol on HDL concentration appears to be independent of beverage type (van der Gaag et al., 2001). Either form of HDL favors the removal of cholesterol from the arteries, transferring it to the liver for metabolism. HDLs also appear to interfere with LDL oxidation. Because the HDL/LDL ratio affects the degree and rate of cholesterol turnover, the slower the rate, the greater the likelihood of oxidation (Walzem et al., 1995) and eventual plaque formation.",

In a recent in vitro study, though, monomeric or low-molecular-weight flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids enhanced platelet aggregation and LDL oxidation, with only large polymers being inhibitory (Shanmuganayagam et al., 2012). In another investigation, the combined effect of several phenolics was superior to single compounds (Wallerath et al., 2005). The action partially results from the enhanced synthesis and release of nitric oxide by endothelial cells. This has been found to occur at resveratrol concentrations associated with moderate wine consumption (Gresele et al., 2008). Chlorogenic acid also appears to activate nitric oxide production (Mubarak et al., 2012). Nitric oxide induces vasodilation (by relaxing vascular smooth muscle), reduces blood pressure, and limits platelet adhesion to blood vessel endothelia. Indicative of the complexities of such interactions is the observation that flavonoids may also inactivate nitric oxide (Verhagen et al., 1997). In addition, nitric oxide, notably as peroxynitrile, oxidizes LDLs. Clearly, much more still needs to be known before a clear picture emerges.",

Type 2 diabetes appears to result when body cells fail to respond properly to the presence of insulin. The incidence of metabolic syndrome is also lower in wine drinkers (Rosell et al., 2003). These effects may be due to one or more of the following: the influences of alcohol on metabolism; the antidiabetic properties of the element vanadium (for which wine is a significant source) (Brichard and Henquin, 1995, Teiss\u00e8dre et al., 1996); the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of phenolics such as resveratrol (Su et al., 2006); or through some effect on endothelial nitric oxidase synthase (Leighton et al., 2006).

At the concentrations typically found in table wine, though, ethanol diminishes the carcinogenicity of ethyl carbamate. Certain wine phenolics can be protective, whereas others mutagenic, especially at high concentrations. For example, quercetin can induce mutations in laboratory tissue cultures, but is a potent anticarcinogen in whole-animal studies (Fazal et al., 1990). This apparent anomaly may result from differences in the concentrations of quercetin used, and/or the low levels of metal ions and free oxygen found in the body (vs. tissue culture). In addition, quercetin, along with several other phenolics that are potential carcinogens, lose this attribute when present as a glycoside. Most phenolics in the plasma occur in some conjugated state, not as free phenolics. In addition, phenolics may detoxify the small quantities of nitrites commonly found in food. However, in the presence of high nitrite concentrations (a preservative found in smoked and pickled foods), nitrites are converted into diazophenols (Weisburger, 1991). These appear to favor the development of oral and stomach cancers.",

Figure 12.8\nillustrates the range of sulfur dioxide contents potentially found in Californian wine. A small proportion of wine-sensitive asthmatics may experience bronchial constriction on exposure to sulfite (Dahl et al., 1986). In a study by Vally and Thompson (2001), wine containing 300 ppm sulfite induced a rapid drop in forced expiratory volume, reaching a maximal decline within about 5 min. Recovery took between 15 and 60 min. The same individuals did not respond to wine containing 20, 75, or 150 ppm sulfite. Why sensitive asthmatics episodically react to wines with low S02 contents may be related to changes in the state of their asthma control. Surprisingly, red wines appear to provoke more asthma problems than white wines, even though red wines typically have lower sulfur dioxide contents than white wines.",

The syndrome is associated with a malfunctional form of mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2*2) (Enomoto et al., 1991), and is particularly pronounced in the absence of at least one functional allele). ALDH2 is the principal enzyme oxidizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid. It is estimated that up to 50% of eastern Asians express this allergic-like reaction on alcohol consumption. It has been suggested that the ALDH2 mutant, frequently found in eastern Asians, may reflect an evolutionary selective adaptation to the endemic occurrence of hepatitis B in the region (Lin and Cheng, 2002). The resulting avoidance of alcohol would avert any synergism between alcohol and hepatitis B-induced liver damage. A malfunctional alcohol dehydrogenase allele (ADH2) is also suspected to play a contributing role in flushing reactions (Eriksson et al., 2001).",

The connection between acetaldehyde and histamine is supported by the action of antihistamines in reducing the reaction, if taken in advance of an alcohol challenge (Miller et al., 1988). An alternative proposal is that this flushing reaction results from a direct, cutaneous, alcohol-induced vasodilation. The phenomenon tends to be suppressed by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), if taken before an alcohol challenge (Truitt et al., 1987). Facial flushing, concomitant with alcohol consumption, but devoid of other symptoms, is occasionally experienced by Caucasians. Whether this is related to an ALDH malfunction is unclear.",

Other common foods are much higher in histamine content, for example cheeses. Nonetheless, wine could provoke increased sensitivity.

            "text": "One of the most severe headache syndromes, potentially associated with wine consumption, is the migraine. Migraines appear to be induced by a wide range of environmental stimuli, possibly because migraines themselves have a complex etiology. The dilation of cerebral blood vessels, partially as a result of histamine release, appears to be a common element in many headache syndromes. Migraines may be one of them, although current thought suggests a neurological rather than a vascular origin. When red vs. white wines were discovered to contain higher concentrations of biogenic amines, such as histamine and tyramine, there was the initial assumption that they were the culprits. However, it was later realized that the normal levels of histamine in red wines are below those that generally trigger a migraine. In addition, double-blind studies have seemingly exonerated histamine in most red-wine-induced migraine headaches (Masyczek and Ough, 1983). Nevertheless, alcohol can suppress the action of diamine oxidase, an important enzyme in the small intestine that inactivates histamine, and other biogenic amines (Jarisch and Wantke, 1996). Thus, in individuals with histamine intolerance, sufficient histamine may enter the blood system to provoke a vascular headache or unrelated allergy-like symptoms. However, this view does not correlate with the observation that spirits and sparkling wine are more frequently associated with migraine attacks than table wines (white or red) or beer (Nicolodi and Sicuteri, 1999). Both spirits and sparkling wines are low in histamine content. However, both are more likely to be taken alone, possibly on an empty stomach, leading to more rapid and higher spikes in blood alcohol content.",

            "text": "Although the biogenic amine content of wine appears to be insufficient to cause migraines in most individuals, the phenolic content of wine might explain why red wines are more frequently associated with a variety of headache sequelae than white wines. On average, red wines contain about 1200 mg/liter phenolics, vs. 200 mg/liter for white wines. Some, but not all, phenolics suppress the action of platelet phenolsulfotransferase (PST) (Jones et al., 1995, Yeh and Yen, 2003). It is an important detoxifier of phenolics and amines. Distinct isozymic versions, PST-M and PST-P, preferentially catalyze the sulfation (detoxification) of various endogenous and xenobiotic biogenic amines and phenolics. Individuals having low levels of platelet-bound PST-P are apparently more susceptible to migraine headaches (Alam et al., 1997). Small phenolic compounds can prolong the action of potent hormones and nerve transmitters, such as histamine, serotonin, dopamine, adrenalin, and noradrenaline. Biogenic amines activate the liberation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), an important brain neurotransmitter. It also promotes platelet aggregation and blood vessel dilation. An increase in intercranial pressure may be involved in the perception of pain in a migraine attack (Pattichis et al., 1995). Nonetheless, most research suggests alternate associations between histamine and migraines. People prone to migraine headaches may also show abnormal and cyclical patterns in platelet sensitivity to 5-HT release (Jones et al., 1982, Peatfield et al., 1995). This may explain why wine consumption is not consistently linked to migraine induction.",

Contraction of the membranes covering the brain (the meninges) could pull on fibers attaching the outer most layer (dura mater) to the skull, causing pain sensors to discharge. Alternatively, the diuretic effect of ethanol could result in electrolytic imbalance. The resultant disruption of normal nerve and muscle function could theoretically induce symptoms such as headache, nausea, and fatigue. Ethanol can also induce the breakdown of glycogen in the liver. The resulting influx of glucose, on being eliminated in the urine, could produce hypoglycemia and a feeling of weakness. Finally, the breakdown of ethanol, via the hepatic microsomal pathway, increases the release of free radicals in the blood, causing cellular damage and a diverse range of metabolic disruptions.

However, recent studies have found that dental erosion can be a risk (Mok et al., 2001, Mandel, 2005, Chikte et al., 2005). Damage results from the frequent and extended exposure to wine acids. Removal of calcium softens the enamel, which becomes susceptible to erosion by masticatory forces and tooth brushing. Demineralization commences at about pH 5.7. Dental erosion is not a problem for the typical consumer, who takes wine with meals. Food and saliva secretion limit, if not prevent, demineralization of tooth enamel. However, after many years, professional wine tasters may experience tooth disfiguration, affecting both tooth shape and size. Cupping, a depression in the enamel, exposing dentine at the tip of molar cusps, is a frequent clinical sign. Erosion can also contribute to severe root abrasion at the gum line. Protection is partially achieved by rinsing the mouth with an alkaline mouthwash after tasting, application of a fluoride gel (such as APF), and refraining from tooth brushing for at least one hour after tasting. The delay permits minerals in the saliva to rebind with enamel. For more protective protocols see Ranjitkar et al. (2012).",

Xenobiotics are an inescapable aspect of life, both modern and ancient. Their universal presence in the natural environment presumably provided the selective pressures that favored the evolution of organs, such as the liver and kidney, and the presence of multiple detoxifying enzyme systems in animals. Thankfully, our bodies inactivate most xenobiotics rapidly and effectively, without our conscious knowledge. In addition, governmental agencies set regulations and assess compliance to limit the better-known toxicants to well below known safe limits. As long as exposure to toxicants is kept to a bare minimum, consumers can basically forget they exist. Overreaction to one source of toxicant can give rise to a unjustified faith that none is present.",

            "text": "The most important wine contraindication relates to those with a past history of alcohol abuse. For the majority of adults (except pregnant women), moderate wine consumption appears to have significant health benefits. Nevertheless, there are several situations in which wine consumption, even in moderate amounts, can complicate or diminish the effectiveness of disease treatment.1.The acidic nature of wine can aggravate inflammation and slow the healing of ulcers in the mouth, throat, stomach, and intestinal tract. Other constituents in wine may also be detrimental in this regard. Thus, all beverages containing alcohol are usually contraindicated in cases of gastritis, gastric cancer, and bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Nevertheless, the prophylactic action of red wine against Helicobacter pylori, and the suppression of histamine production by the gastric mucosa (Masquelier, 1986) may require a reconsideration of the old prohibition in mild cases. In the presence of pancreatitis, alcohol is absolutely contraindicated.2.Wine, along with other alcoholic beverages, may provoke gastroesophageal (acid) reflux in individuals prone to this syndrome.3.In liver disease, the consumption of wine is normally contraindicated. The presence of alcohol puts additional stress on an already weakened vital organ. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to cirrhosis of the liver.4.In acute kidney infection, wine should be avoided. The consumption of alcohol increases the burden on an organ essential to eliminating toxic metabolic wastes.5.In prostatitis or genitourinary infections, the consumption of alcohol can complicate matters. The diuretic action of wine may increase the frequency of urination or, conversely, it may induce highly painful urinary retention.6.In epilepsy, the consumption of even moderate amounts of wine may increase the frequency of seizures.7.Consumption should be strictly limited in most situations of hypertension, hemorrhagic stroke, or atrial fibrillation.8.In patients about to undergo surgery, the effect of alcohol on reducing platelet aggregation is undesirable. Thus, it is recommended that patients terminate any alcohol (as well as aspirin) consumption well before surgery. This avoids increasing any tendency to enhance intra- and postoperative bleeding (Wolfort et al., 1996).\n",

The most well-known example is the antabuse reaction associated with consumption of alcohol with Coprinus atramentarius (Inky Cap). Another mushroom generating the same response is Boletus luridus (Budmiger and Kocher, 1982). The antabuse reaction derives its name from the trade name of disulfiram, a medication used in the treatment of alcoholism. It functions as an inhibitor of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Even when small amounts of alcohol are consumed, along with disulfiram, a very unnerving reaction follows. These may include flushing, sweating, weakness, vertigo, blurred vision, difficulty breathing, nausea, chest pain, palpitation, and tachycardia. In severe cases, the reaction can provoke acute congestive heart failure, convulsion, and death. Simultaneous consumption of alcoholic beverages while using certain drugs (e.g., cephalosporins, griseofulvin, chloramphenicol, sulfonylurea, metronidazole) can produce similar symptoms in sensitive individuals.",

Nevertheless, even small amounts of alcohol may cause loss of muscle control in people taking tricyclic antidepressants.
