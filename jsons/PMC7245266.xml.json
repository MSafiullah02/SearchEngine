Although it is currently used in Russia and China to combat influenza, it has shown in vitro activity against numerous DNA and RNA viruses including SARS-CoV [60,62,63]. It primarily targets the interaction between viral capsid and the membrane of the host cell by inhibiting the attachment, the fusion and the internalization of the virus [60]. Moreover, umifenovir has direct virucidal effects against enveloped viruses through interaction with the viral lipid envelope or with key residues within structural proteins of virions [60,63,64]. Limited data support that umifenovir may exhibit immunomodulatory effects by stimulating hosts\u2019 humoral immune response, interferon production, and phagocytes\u2019 activation [65]. A small retrospective study in China demonstrated some promising results regarding its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 when used in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir [66].

Moreover, prompt testing and isolation are of utmost importance for disease prevention. At the moment, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is the reference standard in diagnostics [93]. The FDA has recently announced the authorisation of rapid molecular tests that are capable of delivering results within minutes, thus facilitating early treatment initiation (when viral loads are highest) and timely isolation [87,94,95].",
