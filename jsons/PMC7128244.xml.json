As of 2000, climate change was directly accountable for the loss of at least 5.5 million disability-adjusted life years.1 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected average global temperatures will increase between 1.8\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C over the next century,2 and extreme weather events and shifting patterns of disease are expected to have significant effects on global disease burden, water and food security, and social conflict\u2014although the extent and direction of these effects will be differentially felt.3, 4, 5 Given the complexity of social and environmental factors that influence disease and health outcomes, the precise degree of past and future effects on health is unclear; however, best estimates indicate that climate change will tip the scales of health outcomes unfavorably.6, 7 The World Health Organization (WHO), for example, estimated in the early 2000s that climate change was already accounting for 150,000 additional deaths globally (ie, deaths above the baseline) per annum. This number has been updated such that compared with a future without climate change (for the year 2030) an additional 38,000 deaths annually are projected due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhea, 60,000 due to malaria, and 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition. This corresponds to an additional 250,000 deaths per year for the years 2030-2050\u2014not including all climate-sensitive health effects (eg, pollution, injuries, nonmalarial infectious disease, and others for which projection data is lacking).8 Direct health costs are projected to increase from US$1.2 trillion to between US$2 and $4 trillion per year,8 and, when agricultural loss, damage due to extreme weather events, and decreased productivity are added, the estimated economic loss could reach 3.2% of global output.9\n",

The effects of climate change cannot be isolated from social and ecological determinants of disease that will mitigate or exacerbate forecasted health outcomes.

We conducted a literature review of pathways between climate change and health and drew on these findings and our collective expertise to review opportunities for both adaptation (defined herein as adjustment strategies to reduce vulnerability to negative effects, also within the domain of preparedness and response) and mitigation (prevention of effects) that demand genuine collaboration toward reducing global health risks posed by climate and other global environmental changes. The opportunities align with and emphasize the preventive measures of the recent recommendations put forth in the new Lancet Commission on Climate Change report including near-term investments in research, monitoring and surveillance on climate change and health effects, adopting mechanisms that facilitate intra- and intergovernmental collaboration with an emphasis on the extent to which additional global environmental changes influence health outcomes, phasing out of coal-fired energy generation, and transition to human- and planet-healthy cities.7\n",

Although commonly broadly grouped as vector-borne diseases (VBDs), zoonoses (emerging or endemic), neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and water-borne diseases, the boundaries between the disease types are not always clear or well defined. For example, some NTDs are VBDs and also waterborne; many diseases transmitted by vectors are also zoonotic. Vector-borne diseases are one of the most studied health challenges pertaining to climate change.32 Although variation has been observed for specific diseases, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),33 some regions reported expansion of vector range due to rising temperatures\u2014this has been noted with latitudinal and longitudinal shifts of tick-borne encephalitis in Europe34 in addition to mosquito-borne malaria in eastern Africa associated with a warming trend beginning in the 1970s.17 Similar increases in malaria in southern Africa and South America35 have been associated with the heavy rainfall of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation cycle (ENSO). However, it should be noted that other authors have disputed the influence of climate change on malaria distribution, suggesting that other issues such as the spread of drug resistance and effects of tightening or relaxing of control measures are more significant factors determining malaria risk.36 Based on minimal climate change scenarios, some African countries may see a 25% increase in the number of malaria cases per 1000 people and more than a 20% increase in treatment costs.37 Similarly, modeling has projected the expansion of transmission season and range for mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus, especially in the Canadian prairie provinces.38\n",

Air pollution has also contributed to mortality and morbidity and is an increasing risk in developed and developing countries alike.45 In a first study of its kind in the WHO European region, the overall annual cost of health effects and mortality resulting from air pollution, including estimates for morbidity costs, was estimated to exceeded US$1.5 trillion (corresponding to 600,000 premature deaths).46 Separately, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that air pollution-related morbidities and mortalities correspond to $1.7 trillion annually in OECD countries, $1.4 trillion in China, and $0.5 trillion in India. In 2012, around 80% of the 3.7 million deaths from outdoor pollution came as a result of stroke and heart disease, 11% from lung diseases, and 6% from cancers.47 Although not commonly considered a pollutant with direct inhalation effect on health, one analysis extrapolates that carbon dioxide could result in more than 21,000 premature deaths per year globally related to ozone and air particles effects.48\n",

The International Health Regulations (IHR) of the WHO, now in its second edition, represents the main governance mechanism to promote public health security of member countries. Primarily focused on reporting and response at a country level to aid in preparedness, the capacity established by the IHR could be expanded to include proactive approaches. Updates to the IHR could focus on disease prevention through risk reduction, including public and community engagement and health education, and closer integration with environmental, agricultural, and other sectors to encourage multidisciplinary understanding and solutions. Most directly, for a number of diseases with strong links to climate and weather, such as RVF, close working relationships between national and local public health and weather services, as well as agricultural or wildlife entities where sentinel monitoring may be possible, can help improve forecasting to enable risk-reduction strategies. The US Department of Defense and its partners have developed climate anomaly forecasting methods that provide weather-related disease projections (eg, El Ni\u00f1o conditions) up to 8 months in advance, including areas of heightened risk for specific infectious and NCDs (such as expected respiratory illness associated with forest fires during drought events).63 This information can help shape public health strategies and inform health providers for early detection or risk mitigation of disease.",

Although the separate goals and detailed targets discussed to date appear to reinforce a siloed approach, there are many potential areas of horizontal integration toward the creation of more sustainable and healthy societies, especially if investments also promote cross-disciplinary implementation. Although goals 3 and 13 are specific to health and climate change respectively, all 17 goals directly or indirectly relate to health and ecological determinants or outcomes. For example, goal 7, to \u201cEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\u201d64 is critical for functioning hospitals; as seen in the West Africa Ebola crisis, basic capacities are limited or nonexistent in parts of the world, plaguing health care delivery, diagnostics, and reporting. Ad hoc health care systems capacity investments have been made in the region, but the expected future projects to build capacity in West Africa provide a ripe opportunity to ensure solar energy production or other sustainable infrastructure (in terms of both low-carbon and low ongoing costs). Similarly, under the heading of resilient, safe, and sustainable cities and human settlements, proposed target b for goal 11 prescribes by 2020 \u201cintegrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, develop and implement. . . holistic disaster risk management.\u201d64 Similarly, proposed goal 15 aimed at protecting, restoring, and promoting \u201csustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss\u201d is essential to the provision of multiple ecosystem services that promote health and well-being.10 Working from this frame can enable more proactive risk analysis and planning around environmental, social, financial, and health outcomes. Given their catastrophic effect, emerging infectious diseases (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, estimated at costing the global economy of US$30 billion or more and disruption of trade and travel),65 are a logical inclusion when considering disaster risks faced by society.",

For example, the UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program, which provides developing nations with monetary incentives to preserve forest areas, could be expanded with the help of health professionals to encompass health benefits or risks of forest conversion or protection scenarios. Financial effects related to disease prevention and preservation of other health-benefitting ecosystem services could be quantified into forest valuations, allowing a fuller assessment of the public good and short- and long-term costs, financial gains or savings expected from land planning decisions and providing a common platform for climate change mitigation and prevention of potential negative health effects associated with deforestation. Multidisciplinary collaboration in natural resource planning has utility for the health community as means for developing upstream intervention or reducing vulnerabilities that may be influenced by climate change or its drivers. For example, decision making on water resource allocation will ideally involve diverse stakeholders, including from public health, agriculture, energy, and natural resource management sectors to anticipate and weigh benefits and adverse effects (eg, positive or negative implications for sea shipping, irrigation access, energy generation, flooding and drought, waterborne disease, and water and food security). Working together, health, ecological, and other professionals can help assemble the expertise and information needed to understand the environmental components that may influence disease risks\u2014for example, anticipating how factors such as forest cover and soil quality affect water absorption and the resulting implications for flooding and associated disease risks.",

This can occur in several ways, including the coproduction of knowledge (eg, coordinated research question generation) and, where findings are not interpretable to direct action, translating relevance to a given sector(s). For example, health scientists could take risk projection findings further to calculate the cost of inaction or the gains of solution scenarios or the scientific community could examine the cumulative health impacts associated with ecosystem alteration, and help to identify and refine implementation strategies to address these challenges in a more coordinated fashion. Even within the scientific community itself, however, collaboration is not routine, despite potential research, understanding, and intervention efficiencies. To promote collaboration across scientific disciplines and bridge research and policy oriented toward sustainability solutions, the Future Earth scientific platform was established in 2014, merging international global change projects representing atmospheric sciences, ecosystem services, health, urbanization, and other disciplines. For this model to be optimized, some baseline challenges will need to be overcome: common metrics and data sharing systems do not currently exist, research investments typically are still oriented to single-discipline approaches, understanding of long-term trends is limited by the short-term nature of research funding, and (outside of clinical medicine) pathways are generally not yet in place for wide-scale research-to-solution processes.",

Co-investments across sectors, or at least reinforcing ones, have practical value as well. Although typically applied to for-profit contexts, we can consider the process of innovative disruption, which circumvents incumbents to effectively provide an alternative that catches an underserved market or outperforms. Shifting a portion of global health investments from reactionary approaches to preventive capacity could support development of needed renewable technologies such as solar microgrids; building local capacity for installation and maintenance could reduce cost and technological barriers for uptake and use. Capitalizing on voluntary corporate collaboration may be highly fruitful; as of 2012, 1.6% of publically traded companies held more than half of the market value globally, representing enormously powerful interests; gaining their collaboration in sustainable investments could lead to new industry standards.67 Finally, although a survey of company managers suggested only 27% view climate change as a business risk,68 compelling industry losses are at stake from broader ecological changes. For example, outbreaks of Marburg virus in Eastern Africa, associated with human encroachment into wildlife habitat for natural resource extraction, prompted mine closures.69 Adding health to routine environmental and social impact assessment processes for development projects can help identify and mitigate public health risks. There are many opportunities for engagement among those organizations already conscientious of the range of effects (positive and negative) that their investments may have. Multilateral development banks and bilateral aid agencies may be best positioned to lead here given their long histories undertaking impact assessments and diverse expertise, including health. These assessments might include assessment of health inequities of disease burden or disproportionate health-related financial impact to certain populations\u2014infrastructure or systems resiliency can also be assessed and improved to reduce vulnerability of investments under climate change. Risks are also highly relevant to reinsurance companies, as their clients increasingly face climate-related losses that add to volatility of risk management.

Likewise, ensuring the full involvement of local communities, who are in the first line of defense against ecosystem degradation and unsustainable use of resources and are those most affected when these resources are depleted, is equally critical to the success of any prevention, preparedness and response strategy that seeks to jointly optimize health outcomes. Moreover, systematic planning to optimize co-benefits is also essential, and could have enormous cost savings from prevention of negative outcomes. For example, built environment modifications that encourage physical activity (eg, active transit) can help address obesity rates, and if using low-carbon alternatives, in the long term may feed into measures for climate change control.70 Large-scale building investments may rely on privatized investments, but the public sector can take measures to require cross-sectoral land use planning and project review and provide industry incentives, as well as the public infrastructure required for successful business growth.",
