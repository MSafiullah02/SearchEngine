This class of heterocycles is important for medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. Indeed, the oxadiazole derivatives exhibit a wide range of biological activity: they are partial agonists of 5-HT4\n[1], 5-HT1B serotonin receptors [2], inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome [3], and exhibit antibacterial activity [4]. Moreover, they are building blocks for anti-inflammatory [5], antifungal [6], [7], [8], antiparasitic [9], and antimicrobial [10], [11], [12], [13] drugs. In addition, they show anticonvulsant [14], anti-HIV [15], and antituberculostatic activity [16]. They have also been used in pesticide chemistry [17], polymer [18], and material science [19], [20], [21]. Owing to their manifold activity, still new oxadiazole derivatives are synthesized and examined for their biological activity to search for and develop desired properties such as, for example, analgesic, antiviral, or anticancer activity [5], [22].",

Also, the vibrational spectra were calculated and analyzed for 2-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives [24]. Thermal stability and the pyrolysis mechanism of 2,5-dipicryl-1,3,4-oxadiazole were studied at the UB3LYP/6-31G* level [25], [26]. The intramolecular proton-transfer process, rotational process, and optical properties were studied for 1,3,4-oxadiazoles with TD-DFT methods [27]. The hyperpolarizability and molecular frontier orbital energy of some donor\u2013acceptor oxadiazoles were investigated in the context of possible non-linear optical properties by ab initio and DFT methods [28]. The luminescence properties of selected oxadiazoles were successfully supported by DFT calculations [29].",

            "text": "Estimation of relative stability of series of isomers is one of the main objective of this study. The error of energy differences is therefore an important and delicate issue. Indeed, it is known that for set of molecules belonging to different structural classes the absolute error in energy (heats of formation) may exceed 10 kcal/mol [38]. However, for selected type of reactions and small variation of functional groups, the error can be reduced to ca. 1 kcal/mol [39], [40]. Nevertheless, a careful verification of the error of energy differences was beyond this study. Here, we deal with relative Gibbs free energies of series of constitutional isomers and tautomers. In such a case, several terms, that would introduce additional errors, are canceled. Therefore, we roughly estimate the error to ca. 2 kcal/mol. It is clear, that the differences placed within 2 kcal/mol interval must be treated with caution, yet, we believe that large differences estimated in this study cannot be reversed by an increased level of theoretical approximation.",

However, some of the tautomers cannot be easily represented by a classical structural formula, because, it is not possible to draw one of the double bonds in the manner satisfying classical valency rules. In other words, there is no unequivocal match of the double bonds in the ring. These structures are called non-Kekul\u00e9an, while those for which the unequivocal match exists, are called Kekul\u00e9an.

Since in oxadiazolthione isomers the heterocyclic ring strain remains very similar to that in oxadiazolone isomers we expected that energetic differences between isomers and tautomers remain similar. This is indeed the truth which is reflected by good linear correlation between relative Gibbs free energies of oxadiazolones and corresponding oxadiazolthiones (Fig. 1\na). There are however some differences related to the fact that the substituent effect produced by the OH and SH groups, as well as by the C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nO and CS moieties, are different. Indeed, in monosubstituted benzenes, the OH group withdraws ca. 0.56 \ne from the sigma orbitals while donate ca. 0.12 \ne to the pi electron system of benzene, whereas the SH group withdraws ca. 0.15 \ne from sigma orbitals and donates ca. 0.09 \ne to the pi electron system [41]. The differences in action of the external O and S atoms in the CO and CS groups on heterocyclic system are connected to so called \u201cnatural\u201d pi electronegativity of the two atoms which is equal to ca. 3.43 and 2.86, respectively [42], and which can be also reflected by recently constructed pEDA(=) descriptor [43].",

However, in contrast to data collected in Table 1, the oxapyrazol-2-thione tautomers, A3 and A4, are the next most stable forms. For oxadiazolthione isomers, the energy difference between A1 and B1 molecules is almost equal to that for oxadiazolone isomers. Yet now, the B1 molecule is less stable than A3 and A4 forms. The B1 form is the most stable in the B-type tautomers. However, the B3 and B4 rotamers are first, degenerated energetically and second, they are only 1.5 kcal/mol less stable than the B1 form. In oxadiazolone isomers the B3 and B4 rotamers themselves are separated by ca. 1.5 kcal/mol. This is a consequence of the difference between stabilizing and destabilizing factors coexisting when the intramolecular XH\u22efY hydrogen bonds is formed (where X= O for oxadiazolone isomers and X= S for oxadiazolthiones isomers and Y= O and N in the two cases) The XH\u22efY intramolecular hydrogen bond is always stabilizing but much stronger for the OH\u22efY than the SH\u22efY moiety, because the O atom is more electronegative than the S atom. In the B3 and B4 rotamers, two different electronegative elements, N and O, are adjacent to the XH group. So, formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond with one of them, simultaneously results in a close repulsive contact of the lone electron pairs of the second of them. However, the C\u2014S distance is much longer than C\u2014O one, and both the attractive and repulsive interactions are small and not differentiating the B3 and B4 rotamers.",

Furthermore, the F3 isomer (1-thiaimidazol-3-ol), separated from the B1 form by ca. 8.4 kcal/mol is the next most stable one. The A1 molecule (3H-1-thiapyrazol-2-one), which has been the most stable for oxadiazolone isomers, is now only the third most stable structure. Also, the crude rules can be formulated a bit differently. The (Kekul\u00e9an) B and F structures, in which the N-atoms are separated by the C-atoms, exhibit relative free Gibbs energy not higher than ca. 12 kcal/mole. The case in which the three heteroatoms are adjacent have to be divided into subcases: the case in which the N-atoms are separated by the S-atom and the case when the S-atom is adjacent to the NN-moiety. In the former case, D isomers, the energy of (Kekul\u00e9an) structures are ca. 15\u201320 kcal/mol energetically higher then the B1 structure, whereas in the later case, C and E forms, they are less stable by at least 28 kcal/mol. Unlike for oxadiazolone isomers, the cyclic urea derivatives, F, are quite stable (Table 3). For each type of constitutional isomers, the non-Kekul\u00e9an forms are the least stable. On the other hand, as for oxadiazolone isomers, the most stable tautomers in the D, E, and F groups are the OH-tautomers stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond (D4, E3, and F3, respectively), however, their rotamers (D3, E4, and F4) are almost equally stable.",

Moreover, the C\u2014S(H) distance is much larger than the C\u2014O(H) and the intramolecular interactions of the SH group are weaker. For thiadiazolone and thiadiazolthione isomers the most stable is the 4H-[1], [2], [4]thiaimidazol-5-one and 4H-[1,2,4]thiaimidazol-5-thione molecule, respectively. The thiadiazolthione isomers seem to be even more stable than the thiadiazolone isomers.",
