It has caused significant mortality in populations of Penaeus monodon (Chantanachookin et al., 1993; Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995; Flegel et al., 1995) . Clinical signs of affected shrimp characteristically include a discolored, yellow cephalothorax, and the virus infects primarily hemocytes, connective tissue, and tissues of the lymphoid organ and gills (Lightner, 1996) . A YHV-like virus, named gill-associated virus (GAV), has been reported in Australia (Spann et al., 1997) . GAV is 0044-8486/02/$ -see front matter D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, GAV-infected P. monodon do not have the yellow cephalothorax commonly found in association with YHV-infection. Comparison of three regions of ORF1b, total 1.7 kb, of YHV and GAV showed 80 -85% homology in nucleotide sequence (Cowley et al., 1999) . Recently, the sequence analysis of GAV genome revealed that GAV is related to arteri-and coronaviruses (Cowley et al., 2000) .",

The histological analysis showed a viral infection characteristic of YHV. Further in situ hybridization studies with a YHV gene probe showed that the positively reacting lymphoid organs had normal tubular structure; neither spheroids nor tubule disorganization were found ( Fig. 2A) . Positive reactions with this virus were also found in the gills (Fig. 2B) , in the hemolymph within the hepatic artery (Fig. 2C) and in connective tissues. The hepatopancreas tubules did not react with the probe, but the surrounding connective tissues were positive (Fig. 2C) . The reactions of muscle cells were negative (data not shown). Based on the virus origin, histopathology, in situ hybridization, and the fact that this virus is highly pathogenic, this YHV-like virus is likely to be closely related to GAV. These data showed that the presumed GAV can infect P. vannamei and cause mortality. In the past, the tissue distribution of shrimp viruses has relied on electron microscope (EM). However, EM analysis is highly technical and time-consuming and, thus, cannot be used for routine diagnosis. In contrast, in situ hybridization provides more specificity in that the positive reaction occurs only with target virus or closely related viruses. Also, the method is relatively easy to perform and can be used routinely by diagnostic laboratories.",
