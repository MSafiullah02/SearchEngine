Depending on the strain of IBV involved, clinical signs may range from minor snicking and head shaking to coughing and gasping. Nephropathogenic strains of IBV can cause accumulation of urates in the tubules which causes polyurea and severe weight loss in affected chickens. In layer chickens, thin- and pale-shelled eggs with watery albumen are suspected to be related to IBV infection, however direct correlation of IBV with the presence of these eggs has been difficult to establish [1], [2]. The differences in tropism and pathogenicity displayed by strains of IBV [3], [4] have major implications for the effective control of IBV infection and development of vaccines with broad cross-protection.",

Both live and inactivated vaccines have been produced and used successfully, with the strain of IBV used for vaccination reflecting the IBV strains prevalent in a particular country or region [12], [13], [14]. Inactivated vaccines have been shown to be effective as booster vaccines in layers and breeders only [15]. Live virus vaccines are effective, although their use carries the risk of reversion to virulence after repeated passage through chickens [16] and/or the acquisition of mutations during passage through embryonated chicken eggs [17]. Selection of an IBV strain for the production of an effective vaccine that induces broad cross-protection is complicated further by the differences in tropism and pathogenicity displayed by IBV strains [3], [4].",

            "text": "In Australia, there are three prominent subgroups of IBV viruses, subgroups 1, 2, and 3, circulating in chicken flocks. Subgroup 1 strains comprise a large group of strains isolated between 1962 and 1984, including the subtype B vaccine strains [18], while subgroup 2 and 3 strains comprise variant IBVs that have emerged over the last 30 years [19], [20]. There are four live virus vaccines available, namely vaccines A, VicS, I and S, and all but vaccine A are the same serotype (subtype B) [18]. The first Australian vaccine produced and widely used was the VicS vaccine [21], which has been used nationally since recognition of IBV in Australian chicken flocks in the 1960s [22], [23], [24]. VicS was developed from an Australian field strain of IBV that caused renal and respiratory disease in young chickens [20], [25], [26] and its structural protein gene region has been sequenced [27]. The pathogenicity of the VicS vaccine has previously been assessed in two-week-old chickens and it was found to cause a slight increase in mortalities as well as histopathological lesions in both the tracheal mucosa and kidneys [3]. It is also believed that under field conditions VicS causes a rather more severe respiratory vaccinal reaction than the other subtype B vaccines in young (less than two-weeks-old) chickens (Dr. Peter Groves; Dr Ben Wells; Dr Roger Chubb; Dr Peter Scott; personal communications). Although this perception has not been investigated as part of a published study, it has led to the limited use of the VicS vaccine in broiler chickens [21], which are not commonly grown past six weeks of age. However, there is widespread use of the VicS vaccine for older chickens, predominantly pullets and breeders during rear to optimise protection against IBV infection during lay, as well as a booster vaccine during the laying period.",

The structural protein gene region comprises all genes from the spike gene (S1/S2) downstream. The IBV S gene product is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 and S2 proteins, which provide mature IBV virions with a receptor binding subunit and a structural transmembrane domain, respectively [28], [29]. One of the most antigenic proteins produced by IBV is the S1 protein, probably because of its location on the surface of the virion. The section of the S gene that encodes S1 is the most variable region of the entire IBV genome [30], [31], [32], [33]. The M and N genes code for the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins respectively, and are each preceeded by genes 3 and 5, respectively, which code for non-structural accessory proteins [34]. Genes 3 and 5 are polycistronic and encode proteins 3a, 3b and E, and 5a and 5b respectively [35], [36]. There was previously reported to be an \u2018intergenic\u2019 region located between the genes M and 5 in the group 3 coronaviruses, IBV and TCoV, however recent reports have demonstrated the presence of two ORFs, 4b and 4c, in this region [37], [38], [39]. Another ORF, 6b, was also detected in these studies immediately downstream of the N gene. As with the known non-structural accessory proteins, the functions of the putative proteins translated from these three ORFs have yet to be fully elucidated.",

This results in a heterogeneous population of viruses transcribed from a single parent genome [40], [41], which is referred to as a \u2018quasi-species\u2019 [42]. Coronaviruses contain the largest known single-stranded RNA genome [43], [44], so it is not surprising that IBV quasi-species have been reported [45], [46]. Further investigation of the dynamics of quasi-species has shown that complementation between individual variants produces the viral phenotype, instead of dominance by a single variant virus in a given environment [47]. Previously, a reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) method designed to amplify a section of the IBV 3\u2032 UTR for diagnosis and differentiation of vaccine and field IBVs found that all IBV vaccine strains tested produced a single amplicon, except for the VicS vaccine, which produced two [48]. One of the amplicons was the same size as the single amplicon produced by other subgroup 1 vaccines and the other was slightly smaller. High resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis of the PCR products amplified from the 3\u2032 UTR of the vaccine and field IBVs concluded that the VicS vaccine did not produce the characteristic HRM curve produced by other subgroup 1 vaccine strains [49].",

These flocks are unexposed and regularly monitored for, and determined to be free of, various pathogens including IBV. At 48 h post inoculation (PI) the allantoic fluid (AF) was collected and subjected to RT-PCR followed by PCR/HRM curve analysis and gel electrophoresis, as previously described [49] to assess the ratio of the two different amplicons in each dilution. At each passage, preparations of AF that showed a dominance of either amplicon were selected and serial dilutions of the AF passaged further. This process was continued until the preparation produced a single amplicon when analysed on an agarose gel. This virus was subsequently passaged an additional two times. The virus concentration (determined as the Egg Infectious Dose \u2013 EID50) was determined by inoculating ten-fold dilution series of the AF containing each viral subpopulation into five, 9\u201311-day-old embryonated commercial chicken eggs, with the embryos assessed at 48 h PI for stunting and curling, as compared to un-inoculated controls [52].

This ratio was not maintained during separation of the subpopulations from the VicS vaccine, and these two distinct subpopulations had comparable growth rates in eggs. However, growth of VicS-v and VicS-del varied considerably in vivo. VicS-del alone caused minimal clinical signs and was less frequently detected in the tissues analysed in this study than VicS-v alone. Interestingly, the differing severity of clinical signs seen in groups inoculated with one or both virus subpopulations suggested that possibly some synergism existed between VicS-v and VicS-del in vivo. Chickens simultaneously inoculated with an even ratio of both subpopulations of virus appeared to display more severe clinical signs for a longer period, and viral RNA was detectable for a longer period, than in chickens that were inoculated with one virus subpopulation alone. This was despite the fact that the quantity of VicS-v inoculated into the VicS-v alone group was twice that inoculated into the VicS-v + VicS-del group (considering this group was inoculated with an even ratio of VicS-v and VicS-del at the same final concentration as the VicS-v alone group).

It appeared that an increase in the number of VicS-del particles in the inoculum was associated with an increase in the severity of clinical signs and infectivity (the only cases of renal infection were in the Vaccine and VicS-v + VicS-del groups), although VicS-v remained the predominant subpopulation detected by RT-PCR. This suggests that the presence of the substantially mutated VicS-del subpopulation potentially boosts the capacity VicS-v (the predominant subpopulation and original vaccine strain) to spread and cause disease in the host; i.e. a synergistic relationship exists between VicS-v and VicS-del in vivo. This is reminiscent of the RNA viral quasi-species theory, which proposes that all variant progeny produced during viral replication comprise the quasi-species and act as a single entity [41]. Interestingly, the coronavirus leader sequence, located at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA, is able to regulate the transcription of other coronavirus genomes infecting the same cell during the template switch process (i.e. in cis or trans) [55], [56]. Therefore, a possibility to be investigated further is whether the molecular machinery produced by VicS-del can be used for the replication of VicS-v in vivo, assuming both viruses can co-infect cells, which would go some way to explaining the concurrence of reduced growth of VicS-del and an increased growth of VicS-v in vivo, in cases when both subpopulations were present simultaneously.",

It has been suggested that changes near the receptor binding domain of the S1 protein could modify the affinity of coronaviruses for different cell surface glycoproteins [57], [58], [59]. Potentially, the variations found in the S1 gene might have reduced the ability of VicS-del to infect respiratory tract cells, but not its ability to infect the cells of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) (where replication of IBV initially occurs in embryonated chicken eggs). As no genome sequence is available upstream of the S1 gene for any Australian strain (including the gene for the RdRP), it is possible that other, unknown genomic differences may have affected the pathogenicity of VicS-del and/or VicS-v. It was not expected that the additional passages through embryonated chickens eggs required to isolate the VicS-del subpopulation would contribute to any differences in the pathogenicity between VicS-v and VicS-del in vivo. It is notable that vaccine viruses are propagated by an already large number of passages in eggs. Passage of IBV in ovo adapts the virus to growth in ovo and reduces the virulence of IBV in vivo\n[60], [61].

After the S gene, most mutations were detected in ORFs 4b and 4c and gene 5a (all mutations identified in gene 5a were present in ORF 4c as these two ORFs overlap). The mutations in ORFs 4b and 4c resulted in substantial changes to the predicted proteins, as 4b would be severely truncated, while 4c would be lengthened, compared to ORFs 4b and 4c in other strains [39]. These ORFs are located in a region of the IBV genome that, until recently, was considered an \u2018intergenic region\u2019. Consequently, no study has been conducted to investigate whether ORFs 4b and 4c are in fact transcribed and/or functional and, if so, what their potential functions might be. However, using the reverse genetics technique, this \u2018intergenic region\u2019 has been removed from an apathogenic IBV (suspected to be a result of adaptation to cell culture) with no obvious effects on the functionality of the virus (Dr. Paul Britton, Institute for Animal Health, personal communication). A recent study demonstrated that replacement of the accessory proteins, including the \u2018intergenic region\u2019 in an apathogenic strain of IBV with those from a pathogenic strain did not restore pathogenicity [62]. This suggests that the IBV non-structural accessory proteins have a limited or non-existent role in strain virulence and tissue tropism and are involved in modulation of the host cell during infection/viral replication. For this reason, it would not be appropriate to investigate the roles of the IBV non-structural accessory proteins in vitro.",

For example, the 40 bp deletion found in the 3\u2032 UTR of VicS-del may affect the efficacy of its replication, as the IBV 3\u2032 UTR contains cis-acting elements involved in virus replication [63]. This could also explain the substantially reduced concentrations of VicS-del detected in chickens inoculated with VicS-del only. It has been shown that host specific variation (variations specific for adaptation to growth in different hosts, i.e. chickens or embryonated chicken eggs) occurs in the coronavirus S1 gene during passage of isolates from clinical specimens in embryonated chicken eggs [59], [64]. The authors of one of these studies [59] describe a single amino acid substitution of a serine with an alanine at position 95 in the IBV S1 protein that is linked to adaptation of viral growth in chickens and eggs respectively. It was concluded that this change did not affect viral pathogenicity. Interestingly, in both VicS-del and VicS there is a serine at position 95, but at position 96 in VicS-del a glutamic acid has been substituted with an alanine. Another study that investigated amino acid differences between the S1 gene of IBVs before and after adaptation to growth in embryonated eggs also found host specific variations in the structural protein gene region [65]. In that study, the authors found an alanine to serine substitution at position 94 in the IBV S1 gene that resulted in attenuation in embryonated eggs, in contrast to the study of Cavanagh et al. (2005) [59]. Based on the evidence in these reports, a single mutation in the S1 protein of VicS-del alone could potentially explain the reduced capacity of VicS-del to grow in chickens, even though it retained its ability to grow efficiently in embryonated eggs.",

The Ct value is the first cycle in which PCR amplification exceeds a specified threshold. Each value represents the average of the triplicate assays performed on each sample. Where two or more points overlapped, horizontal jittering was employed.",
