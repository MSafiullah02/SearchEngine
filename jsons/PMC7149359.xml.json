Its inhabitants are diverse with 15 of the 34 phyla occurring exclusively in the oceans with only one phylum (Onychophora) being reported as present on land only [1]. The marine environment provides an array of structurally unique and diverse constituents produced by an equally diverse consortium of marine organisms living on our coral reefs and in benthic communities. The marine organisms are highly variable in species, color, and morphology and belong to several phyla including Porifera (sponges), Ascidiacea (sea squirts), and Octacorallia (soft corals). The metabolites of marine origin emanate from a variety of parts of the plants and animals and are thought to be produced as a form of chemical communication, defense, or to ward off potential predators [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] (Figure 18.1, Figure 18.2, Figure 18.3\n).\nOf the 34 animal phyla recorded, 15 are ONLY found in the ocean with only 1, Onychophora present on land only.\n\n",

The majority of the marine organisms are extracted fresh or frozen while the remaining specimens are lyophilized or dried in air before extraction [22]. In some instances, dried algal species are ground to a powder prior to extraction as described by Sansom and coworkers who isolated an antiproliferative bis-prenylated quinone from the alga Perithalia capillaris\n[23]. The extraction of marine organisms may be carried out using a range of organic solvents including hexanes, dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, as well as more polar solvents such as ethanol and methanol. In many instances, a mixture of polar and medium polarity or nonpolar solvents is utilized in the extraction protocol. For example, the extraction of the Madagascar sponge Monanchora dianchora was achieved in CH3Cl:MeOH (1:1) to yield two polycyclic guanidine alkaloids [24]. Extractions are usually exhaustively performed over several days with at least three aliquots of the solvent being used. The solvent is then removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation. Solvent partitioning is another strategy employed in the extraction of the organisms. This involves single one-step or two-step partitioning systems usually involving an aqueous phase portioned with a solvent immiscible with that phase. The Kupchan and modified Kupchan procedures are often employed in natural products as was described in the isolation of a diterpene from an Axinella species [25]. In this procedure, the concentration of the aqueous layer is progressively adjusted to afford three or four different fractions. Complex partitioning procedures are also employed, albeit rarely so. Simple partitioning has been most commonly employed with Kupchan schemes being utilized with less frequency [22].",

It entered into Phase 1 clinical trials in 1999 under investigation for the treatment of solid tumors and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Broad spectrum activity was displayed in vitro and in vivo against leukemia, melanoma, breast, ovarian, colon, and lung (nonsmall cell) cancer.

For example, (+) spongistatin 1 has been reported to be highly cytotoxic. It has been deemed to be the most active of all natural and synthetic compounds investigated by the National Institute of Cancer (USA). Three tonnes of the sponge yielded 0.8 mg of the compound. Another collection and processing of 400 kg of the sponge afforded 10 mg of the compound. This isolation work facilitated structure elucidation work. The IC50 value for this compound was evaluated at 10\u22126\n M in colon cancer cells and 10\u221212\n M for breast cancer cell lines [82]. Synthetic approaches to the compound have been presented by research groups including Petit and coworkers [83], [84].",
