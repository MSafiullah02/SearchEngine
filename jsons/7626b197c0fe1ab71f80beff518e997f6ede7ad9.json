However, these medical resources are difficult to obtain during an epidemic. On the other hand, successful control of epidemics such as COVID-19 epidemic demands the cut-off of routes of the possible transmission [8] . In such case, controlling the flow of population as well as community containment would be inevitable, which may affect medical interactivity between neurologists and PWEs, restrict patient access to medical resources, and make the management of epilepsy more difficult than ever.",

Above all, a systematic epilepsy management framework is critical for dynamically responding to epidemic changes. Unfortunately, current epilepsy management framework is generally a periodic outpatient assessment model [9] , where a certain medical center is the node for almost all medical services and patients actively transport themselves from home to hospital periodically. Due to the uncertainty of patient flow and unbalanced accessibility of medical resources, such system is less adaptable and cannot cooperate with disease control policies in epidemic areas. Furthermore, the current framework causes a huge waste of medical resources in that the preference of both doctors and patients, rather than objective need, acts as a major driving force for medical service [10] . Hence, a new framework that avoids unnecessary transportation while maximizing the availability of medical resources according to demand is needed. Here we review approaches that help control epilepsy during an epidemic event and raise a new conceptual management framework.",

Self-management is characterized by abilities of patients to detect and manage their own conditions. These abilities include management of both medical and nonmedical issues such as emotion or role changing [12] . Luedke et al. summarized six aspects of selfmanagement for PWEs based on a systematic review, which are knowledge acquisition, problem solving, medication management, health behavior changing, symptom monitoring, and safety promotion [13] . PWEs have educational needs on two major classes of information for self-management. The first is predesigned knowledge on epilepsy and related issues while the second being a practical guide to self-management of other conditions, especially the psychosocial therapy, and applying it in PWEs [13] . The predesigned epilepsy-specific program largely involves basic knowledge on epilepsy, medication management, and problem-solving suggestions, while psychosocial therapy mainly focuses on health behaviors and related knowledge. To be noted, the details of selfmanagement differ among studies [14] [15] [16] , making it difficult to evaluate the efficacy. A potential solution to this problem is to establish a network that integrates different programs and evaluate their efficacy, effectiveness and dissemination [17] .",

Several concise thresholds for seeking medical help must be emphasized in order to keep PWEs safe. It is also NOT recommended in any condition to self-manage epidemic at any time! Smartphone application and remote medical care in epilepsy management Smartphone applications (APPs) and other remote medical care approaches are familiar things to patients with chronic disease. In epilepsy alone, a series of studies [32] [33] [34] have tested the value of Apps in management of seizures and other issues. Digital technology in the management of epilepsy features a new trend in epilepsy control. There has been a rapid increase of available Apps for PWEs. From the end of 2008 to 2013, the number of epilepsy-related Apps increased from ground zero to 28 [34] . Additionally, an overwhelming majority of these Apps are free for use. In 2018, Escoffery et al. reviewed over 20 Apps from Apple Store for their functionality, esthetics, and information contained. They found that most Apps in epilepsy management are designed for adults and focused on treatment, seizure tracking, response and safety, which cover a significant portion of self-management [32] . Although the population sampled was small, Apps for epilepsy management significantly improved users' epilepsy knowledge, personal safety management and adherence to AEDs [35, 36] .",

Since information gathering from individuals during an epidemic is critical, self-reporting of personal well being is promising. Self-reporting has been widely practiced in China to control COVID-19 outbreak. In China, a health QR code will be generated once a user completes self-report of his (or her) health through an App in the smart phone, which grants the access to train, subway, airline and other public places. However, these reports are not compulsory due to ethical considerations and must be gathered with consensus, limiting its reliability. Transparency of official information on the distribution and number of infected patients in certain areas also helps control epidemics [8, 39, 40] . During the COVID-19 epidemic in China, Apps such as Alipay or Baidu provide this official information on their pages. They post up-to-date information through data-mining and list distributions of confirmed patients according to areas. In addition to digital mapping, these Apps even provide the exact buildings in which patients were discovered. Although this may raise ethical concern, people can be guided to keep a distance from epidemic areas. To be noted, these Apps are not specifically designed for epidemic, but rather flexible in their functions due to modular design. They may provide reference for epilepsy management Apps to meet different needs.",

Another interesting finding of this study is that the attitude of patients with poor seizure control or having adherence issues turned out to be more positive towards Apps.

A study in Zambia carried out in 2010 found that 49.1% of pharmacies did not even have AEDs and only 4 kinds of first-generation AEDs were available [47] . The same situation also occurs in other middle-and low-income countries. A study in 2012 reported that the available rate of basic AEDs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid and phenobarbital is less than 50% in 46 countries [48] . What makes the matter worse is that these developing countries are also susceptible to epidemics, which can further deteriorate the availability of AEDs, if not all medical resources. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, even in major cities, there was a shortage of certain medicines [39] , suggesting that the hospital-and pharmacy-centered supply of medicine has limits, and could not adapt to changes during an epidemic.",

To be brief, the delivering system consists of two parts: intelligent express cabinet placed in the community and certain sets of protective equipment for couriers. In this non-contact system, all packages are delivered to the cabinet instead of to the door. The customer will receive an encrypted code corresponding to a cell of the cabinet where the package is stored, thus preventing direct contact with couriers. On the other hand, couriers are provided with masks, gloves, and glasses in order to prevent direct contact with contaminated goods. The efficiency of such system has been proven in recent COVID-19 epidemic and express companies worldwide have referred to this approach.",

The program enrolled any patient with convulsive epilepsy through a door-to-door interview conducted by local Central Disease Control and primary care physicians, fully covering the population in the program area. The patients received phenobarbital as initial treatment and were followed up monthly for efficacy and safety. Phenobarbital in the program was purchased directly from the pharmaceutical company by program fund, which thus ensured the long-term availability. Although PWEs in this program had limited options of AEDs, convulsive epilepsy was successfully managed in over 7 000 PWEs with convulsive seizures with acceptable adverse events. During the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, there was no report of AED insufficiency in any of the program areas.

Since a clear medical history is key to the diagnosis, online consulting with community caregivers or even epileptologists is recommended before directly visiting a hospital. This approach could avoid blind seeking for medical support and ease the psychological impact from first seizure. Considering that neuroimaging and electroencephalogram are both necessary for diagnosis of new-onset epilepsy, it is important to make an appointment for these tests during an epidemic. Patients must be informed the importance of these examinations for determining the etiology and diagnosis. However, they should also understand that (a) a number of patients will not suffer second seizure in a relatively long period of time, which will even not recur at all [52] ; (b) if the medical history is typical, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made without these tests [53] ; (c) some provoked seizures (i.e. alcohol-induced seizures) can be prevented by avoiding triggering factors [51] ; (d) even with neuroimaging and electroencephalogram tools, the etiology of some onsets may be still controversial due to many factors. Since online prescription systems have already been in legal use, a further decision as whether to start AEDs immediately can also be discussed during online consulting.",
