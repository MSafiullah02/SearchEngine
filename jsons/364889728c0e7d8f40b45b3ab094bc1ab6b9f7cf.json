(2) Significant reduction of respiratory symptoms evaluated by following indicators: cough and expectoration disappeared, normal ranges for inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP, as well as oxygenation index \u2265350. (3) Substantial improvement over conventional chest radiography detection. (4) At least two consecutively negative results of RT-PCR testing separated by at least 24-hour interval. Considering the risk of reinfection, all discharged patients were required another 14 days of self-segregating at home for further observation. The cloacal swab and nasopharyngeal swab samples were both collected from these discharged patients each three days for RT-PCR detection of COVID-19 in the same way as they were in hospital. Among them, 25 discharged patients were identified with positive results again. COVID-19 RNA Detection Kits (Real-time fluorescent PCR method) approved by the National Medical Products Administration were used for virus testing as described previously 5 .",

Ritonavir/lopinavir table was administrated with 500 mg once daily while 50 \u03bcg IFN-\u03b1 was aerosolized 2 times a day. Besides, Chinese herbal medicines were widely recommended by the Chinese Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (On Trials) issued by National Health Commission of China.

They showed no distinguished differences on the levels of laboratory parameters before leaving the hospital. Subsequently, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between serum D-Dimer level before discharging and the duration of treatment in these 25 patients (r=-0.637, p=0.002), instead of the rest 147 patients. Furthermore, lymphocyte concentrations before these 25 patient leaving the hospital were significantly positively correlated (r=0.52, p=0.008) with the time interval for virus reappearing.",

It seems that there was a fluctuating period between of seeming improvement in clinics and full recovery from virus. These less symptomatic carriers brought more challenges to the management and control of COVID-19 epidemic in China and any other affected countries. According to our study, it is probably that two negative RT-PCR tests 24 hours apart may not be sufficient for viral clearance evaluation. Repeated viral RT-PCR testing separated by prolonged duration like 48 hours is essential to assure that virus has actually cleared and the discharged patients no longer transmitted the virus. On the other hand, we suggested that some immunological parameters such as D-dimer and absolute lymphocyte count, and even antibody test should be combined with RT-PCR negative test as additional measures to assure that infected patients have completely recovered and can be released from quarantine. Besides, the RT-PCR results then turning to negative within an average of 2.73 days of hospital stay. Even the Chinese herbal medicine was used for these readmitted patients, it is hard to assess the effect on virus clearance. Further case-control study and cohort study will be needed to pursue that.

            "text": "These were 25 of discharged patients (total 14.5%) sent to hospital again because of the positive RT-PCR results on virus again. With the median age of 28 years (IQR: 16.25-42), 17 of them were females, including 6 children under 12 years old. According to their previous medical records, these patients had experienced an average of 15.36\u00b13.81 days of hospital stay, as well as 13.33\u00b13.93 days of potential antivirus therapy with ritonavir/lopinavir and IFN-\u03b1, no obvious differences with other discharged patients. Before discharging from the hospital, these patients all showed improvements on chest computed tomography (CT) evidence and exhibited with two consecutive negative results (24 hours of interval) on virus mRNA by RT-PCR assays. After leaving the hospital to self-quarantine at home, the discharged patients hadn't taken drug any longer but just monitored at home by RT-PCR detection of COVID-19 with both cloacal swab and nasopharyngeal swab samples in each three days. Unexpectedly, cloacal swab samples of 14 patients turned positive on virus mRNA and another 11 patients showed positive results of nasopharyngeal swab sample testing. Overall, the mean duration from their final negative PCR result to hospital discharge was 2.71\u00b11.88 days. While the average period from positive again to previous discharge lasted for 5.23\u00b14.13 days. Thereby, these 25 patients experienced an average of 7.32\u00b13.86 days from their last negative RT-PCR result to turning positive again.Notably, these patients once represented with the common symptoms of fever (68%) and cough (60%) and 24 of them were non-severe types at the first onset. At this time of hospital readmission, only 8 patients (32%) had mild cough. Besides, CT scan results indicated that 12 of them were characterized by improvement of original lesions compared with images before leaving the hospital, while another 8 patients showed no worsening than previous results. When they readmitted to hospital, the formula of Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction was used for these 25 patients. Within an average of 2.73 days of hospital stay, the RT-PCR results of virus mRNA detection were all turning to negative in both nasopharyngeal swab and cloacal swab samples. These patient were all stayed for a prolonged observation.",
