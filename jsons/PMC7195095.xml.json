In all cases, the tooth has to be placed under the pillow before going to sleep and will have been traded for money by the next morning. Asian beliefs focus more on the future of the adult tooth to come: in China for instance, a baby tooth from the upper jaw has to be thrown under the bed or buried, and one from the lower jaw thrown onto the roof, for the new tooth to grow quickly and straight into the right direction.2\nFunnily enough, mice are an exception among mammals, as they are monophyodonts and thus do normally not shed any teeth, which has made them an interesting model to investigate the evolution of replacement teeth [1]. Mammals for their part are the exception among vertebrates, which are usually polyphyodonts, meaning that they can regrow a practically unlimited supply of replacement teeth all throughout their lifetime [2]. Hence, humans possess a more complex, but only diphyodont dentition: a trial version of deciduous teeth, replaced around age 6 by a permanent set. Loss of any component of the latter, through mechanical injury, infection, or age entails the need for artificial replacement, and usually steep medical bills.",

Given that both the amount and the differentiation potential of ASCs seem to decline with age [6], the trend is to harvest the earliest available cell material with the largest differentiation spectrum. The prime examples are haematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the umbilical cord [7,8]. Notably the latter are currently used in countless clinical trials [9], and kicked off the tissue cryobanking business. As a consequence, in 2018, over 450 companies worldwide offered cord blood banking services.3\nSecuring this cell source however is possible only during an extremely short time window and relies on the individual's parents' sole decision. Therefore, more and more alternative ASC sources have been explored over the recent years. A good example was discussed in a recent issue of the Biomedial Journal, where we discovered the promising potential of locally derived MSCs derived for the repair of anterior cruciate ligaments [10,11].",

In the current context, they serve as a reminder of the heterogeneous nature of MSCs, which can derive from two different embryonic germ layers - mesoderm and ectoderm - and explain why dental pulp stem cells can give raise to functional neurons [14].",

After a frankly entertaining section dedicated to various recommended storage options for tooth transport, from cow milk to sports drinks, the authors speculate on the most likely protocols for stem cell isolation. The two main possibilities are mechano-enzymatic dissociation into single cell populations and tissue outgrowth, with the latter maybe reminding the reader of one early and original way of reprogramming keratinocytes from plucked hair directly in a dish [17]. Tests for viability and pluripotency can vary between companies, while there is little doubt on the efficiency of common freezing protocols, preservation in liquid nitrogen, and finally the possibility to recover functional cells after prolonged freezing.",

In due course, the authors turn in vivo, using a real-time monitored ectopic xenograft model in immunocompromised mice. The previous observation that PDPN expression does not have an effect on proliferation holds true in the mouse model, as knock-down of the protein in P+ cells does not change tumour growth and metastasis compared to the mock shRNA. Nonetheless, survival is considerably shortened in the control compared to mice injected with PDPN knock-down cells.

The authors show that miR-95-3p expression is lower in CRC cell lines and tumour tissue compared to normal intestinal cells or adjacent tissue. Moreover, patients with the lowest miR-95-3p expression levels displayed worse recurrence survival and overall survival rates. Overexpression of miR-95-3p inhibited cell proliferation and mobility of CRC cells in vitro, as well as tumour growth and metastasis in a mouse xenograft model, and improved the survival of the latter. The hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) was identified in silico as a putative target for miR-95-3p, and subsequently validated by several assays.

The curious, liquid metal, commonly known as quicksilver, was used during centuries for medicinal and industrial applications, from magico-religious rituals to metal recovery processes, or to treat syphilis [50]. It took quite some time to recognise the highly harmful effects of mercury, notably on the nervous system [51] - as proven by Minamata disease, the neurological disorder caused by methylmercury released into the industrial wastewater by the Japanese Chisso chemical factory until 1968 [52]. Nowadays, the main sources of human exposure are dental amalgams, occupational exposure, or contaminated fish [53]. Eggplants, on the opposite, are not only delicious on pizza, but fully loaded with health benefits in the form of vitamins, phenolics and antioxidants [54]. Moreover, as shown here by Adelakun et al., feeding rats whole eggplant extract in parallel with mercury chloride reduces significantly the testicular toxicity of the latter by boosting the organism's antioxidant system [55].",

            "text": "Preterm birth (PTB) designates delivery earlier than 37 weeks of gestation and is the leading cause of neonatal death and a major risk factor for death before age 5, as well as developmental disabilities [56]. Early detection of preterm labour is key for adequate prevention and management, however, the underlying causes are complex and multi-factorial. Known risk factors encompass infections, stress, multiple gestations, or maternal body weight - yet about two-thirds of PTB cases lack an apparent predisposition [57]. Measurement of cervical length is so far one of the most reliable and cost-effective methods [58], but over the past decade, much effort was made to additionally identify biomarkers predictive of spontaneous PTB in maternal blood at earlier stages [59,60]. Until now, it has been considered quite unlikely that a single test would be sufficient for predicting PTB [61], however data gathered by Huang and colleagues strongly indicate that maternal inhibin A levels from the second trimester are a good candidate [62]. Inhibin is a glycoprotein and probably named during a peak moment of pragmatism, as it inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, in unsurprising contrast to activin [63]. So far, it has been used as a biomarker for ovarian cancer [64] and Down syndrome [65]. Huang et al. show here that inhibin A levels over 2.25 are statistically significant in their association with preterm labour [62], and might thus be an early clue prompting closer monitoring of the patients.",

Numerous genetic defects and environmental factors can lead to defaults in the final fusion steps, leading among others to a cleft lip and/or palate. Besides problems with feeding, dental occlusion, speech and infections, the condition entails a heavy psychosocial burden, exemplified by the severely biased depiction of individuals with an orofacial cleft as villains in works of fiction.8\nEarly surgery usually achieves the re-establishment of functional features and satisfying facial aesthetics. Nevertheless, both goals can sometimes be conflicting. Multiple articles in the recent issues of the Biomedical Journal have illustrated that the patient's pre- and post-operative opinion and satisfaction are more and more considered for orthognathic surgery [70,71]. Hence, Denadai et al. explain in this issue's editorial note how three-dimensional imaging and computer-aided modelling of the surgery outcome, in combination with the taking into consideration of the patient's, or patient's family's, preferences has improved the outcome of orthognathic orofacial cleft surgery both in terms of functional and aesthetic outcome [72].",
