It was initially declared as public health emergency if international concern by WHO followed by Pandemic on 12 th March 2020. As of 10 th April 2020, more than 1.5 million people are affected globally with around 95000 deaths. Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy. The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article. Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals. Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging. Similarly, use of antiinflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research. The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.",

As shown in figure 3, the viral cycle is like other viruses consisting of attachment, integration, uncoating, use of cell machinery for replication, assembly and finally release of virions. Steps in coronavirus replication are potential targets for antiviral drugs and vaccines.[2] The spike glycoprotein S of coronavirus is a good candidate for vaccines because neutralizing antibodies are directed against glycoprotein S. Blockade of the specific virus receptor on the surface of the host cell by monoclonal antibodies or other ligands can prevent virus entry. Receptor-induced conformational changes in the S protein can be blocked by peptides that inhibit membrane fusion and virus entry. The polyprotein of the replicase protein is cleaved into functional units by virus-encoded proteinases. Protease inhibitors may block replication. The polymerase functions in a unique membrane-bound J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f complex in the cytoplasm, and the assembly and functions of this complex are potential drugtargets. Viral mRNAs made by discontinuous transcription are shown in the cytoplasm with the protein that each encodes indicated at the right. The common 70 base long leader sequence on the 5' end of each mRNA is shown in red.

            "text": "greater risk of COVID infection. However, new research suggests that there are some innate differences between both sexes leading to the difference in the susceptibility. The presence of an extra X chromosome in females lead to lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in men, while CD4+ T cells are higher with better immune response. Besides, women produce higher titre of antibodies which tends to remain in circulation for longer periods. The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is correlated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of interferon (IFN). TLR7 is higher in women than in men and it's biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections. TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members. Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity. In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3 and transcription factor for T regulatory cells (Treg) involved in virus pathogenesis. The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8,J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women, and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations. However, greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines enhances risk of cytokine storm. Thus, drugs acting against pro-inflammatory cytokines can be theoretically more effective in women compared to men and in future, there may be gender wise differential therapy for treatment of COVID 19.Pre-Clinical and Clinical Evidence of drug therapies: A. Chloroquine: \uf0b7 Mechanism of Action: Primarily inhibits the entry, transport and the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2. It increases endosomal pH and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and thereby it has the potential to block viral infection. It also inhibits cathepsins, that leads to the formation of the autophagosome which cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, chloroquine through the inhibition of MAP-kinase interferes with SARS-CoV-2 molecular crosstalk, besides altering the virion assembly, budding and interfering with the proteolytic processing of the M protein.",

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ):\uf0b7 Mechanism of Action: Same as that of chloroquine since same structure except for an additional hydroxy moiety in one terminal in HCQ.\uf0b7 Safety Profile: Addition of hydroxyl molecule makes HCQ less permeable to blood-retinal barrier and allows faster clearance from retinal pigment cell, thereby suggesting a lesser risk of retinal toxicity with Experimental therapeutic strategies attempt to interfere with different steps in the coronavirus replication cycle.

Long-term clinical safety profile of HCQ is better than that of chloroquine since it allows higher daily dose of HCQ with less drugIn-vitro: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 \u03bcM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 \u03bcM) in vitro against SARS-CoV-2.[8] \uf0b7 Animal model: Whether HCQ works in-vivo is not yet proven for COVID-19.[9] \uf0b7 Key Clinical Trial: In an open-label study of 36 patients with COVID-19, use of HCQ (200 mg three times per day for 10 days) was associated with a higher rate of undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal specimens at day 6 compared with no specific treatment (70 versus 12.5 percent).[10] C. Remdesivir (RDV): \uf0b7 Mechanism of Action: It inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription. \uf0b7 In-vitro: It has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-E6 cells with EC50 at 23.15um. \uf0b7 Animal model: It has demonstrated to improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads in mice infected with MERS-CoV.[11] \uf0b7 Key Clinical Trial: A single case report by Holshue et al. described clinical improvement after RDV used to treat the first U.S. case of COVID-19. There are several randomized control trials are currently being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RDV in patients with COVID-19. Two phase III trials initiated in China in February 2020, aimed to evaluate RDV in hospitalized adult patients with mild/moderate (NCT04252664) or severe (NCT04257656) COVID-19 (RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days vs. placebo). Preliminary results of these trials are expected to be announced at the end of April, 2020.[12] D. Lopinavir-ritonavir: \uf0b7 Mechanism of Action: The polyprotein of the replicase protein is cleaved into functional units by virusencoded proteinases which is inhibited by these protease inhibitor combinations. Thus, inhibiting proteolysis.",

            "text": "The US-FDA has accepted emergency investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19.[16] \uf0b7 A case series described administration of plasma from donors who had completely recovered from COVID-19 to five patients with severe COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation and persistently high viral titres despite investigational antiviral treatment. The patients had decreased nasopharyngeal viral load, decreased disease severity score, and improved oxygenation by 12 days after transfusion, but these findings do not establish a causal effect. Finding appropriate donors and establishing testing to confirm neutralizing activity of plasma may be logistical challenges.[17][18]F. Drugs Acting Against Pro-Inflammatory Factors:a) Interleukin 1:Interleukin 1 (IL-1) consists of two molecules namely IL-1a and IL-1b, associated with innate immunity.IL-1b is associated with most of the biological pleiotropic properties and hence it is directly referred as IL-1. IL-1 is proinflammatory cytokine and it binds to IL-1 receptor to modulate it's action. Association with IL-1 receptor leads to recruitment of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Anakinra is one of the anti-Mechanism of Action: Inhibits actions of IL-1 leading to inhibition of cytokine storm which is common reason for fatality in COVID-Current Evidence: No current in-vitro and in vivo evidence specifically for COVID 19. Currently, there is no published clinical trial. However, as per the data on clinicaltrials.gov, there are 8 trials using Anakinra against COVID-19 either in recruitment or pre-recruitment stage.[20] One of the major phase 3 trials using this drug is ongoing in Italy and is initiated by the manufacturer (Swedish Orphan Biovitrum) to evaluate efficacy and safety of anakinra or emapalumab with standard of care in reducing hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19.b) Interleukin 6:IL-6 is one of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 activates its downstream Janus kinase (JAK) signal by binding the transmembrane (cis-signalling) or soluble form (trans-signalling) of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and interacting with membrane-bound gp130. Excessive IL-6 signalling leads to a myriad of biological effects that contribute to organ damage, such as maturing na\u00efve T cells into effector T cells, inducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in epithelial cells, increasing vessel permeability and reduces myocardial contractility.[21]",
