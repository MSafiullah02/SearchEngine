Here we assayed both antibody and T-cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in COVID-19 convalescent patients and healthy donors sampled before and during the pandemic. Our results show that while anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can distinguish convalescent patients from healthy donors, the magnitude of T-cell response was more pronounced in healthy donors sampled during COVID-19 pandemic than in donors sampled before the outbreak. This hints at the possibility that some individuals have encountered the virus but were protected by T-cell cross-reactivity observed. A public and diverse T-cell response was observed for two A*02-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing a set of T-cell receptor motifs displaying germline-encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S is characterized by multiple groups of homologous T-cell receptor sequences some of which are shared across multiple donors, indicating the existence of immunodominant epitopes. Overall, our findings indicate that T cells form an efficient response to SARS-CoV-2 and alongside the antibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying SARS-CoV-2 exposure and immunity. We hope that data, including the set of specific Tcell receptors identified in this study can serve as a basis for future developments of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and monitoring.",

According to the classification by the US National Institutes of Health (35) the patients were categorized as having asymptomatic (n = 2), mild (n = 19) and moderate/severe (n = 10) clinical types of disease. None of the patients required either treatment in the intensive care unit, oxygen supplementation, or invasive ventilation support. The cohort was gender-balanced (15 males, 16 females) and donor age was from 17 to 59 years with a median of 35 years. Peripheral blood was collected at days 17 -49 (median 33) after the onset of the disease or positive PCR-test (Fig.1a) . The control group of healthy donors was formed by recruiting 14 healthy volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic -HD (CoV) with no symptoms and a negative PCR test. Additionally, we used 10 samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from biobanked healthy hematopoietic stem cell donors -HD (BB), which were cryopreserved no later than September 2019, and 10 serum samples of healthy blood donors cryopreserved no later than 2017 -HD (S). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies was tested in the serum samples. Cell samples were used to study T-cellular response to the peptide pools of M-, N-, S-proteins of SARS CoV-2, and to the recombinant surface glycoprotein S (S-protein) as well as to determine the repertoire of T-cell receptors (TCRs) of S-protein specific cells (Fig.1b) . convalescent patients -CP (n=31), healthy donors sampled during COVID-19 pandemic -HD(CoV) (n=14) and obtained from the biobank -HD(BB) (n=10) and serum bank -HD(S) (n=10) were included in study. Peripheral blood was collected and used for in vitro assays with several SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 production by T cells in CP to S-protein and peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 (M, N, and S) was measured by ELISPOT. The S-protein-directed T-cell response was assessed by IFN\u03b3 secretion assay after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with recombinant S-protein, FACSsorted IFN\u03b3-secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were used for sequencing their T-cell receptor (TCR) beta repertoire. Simultaneously, rapid in vitro expansions with predicted HLA-A*02:01-presented S-protein derived peptides were set up, tetramer-positive cells were FACS-sorted and TCR alpha and beta repertoire sequencing was performed. Bioinformatic analysis was used to reveal shared CDR3 motifs in antigen and epitope-specific populations. Antibody-mediated immune response in CP and HD was measured by conventional ELISA with recombinant N-, S-protein, and RBD domain of S-protein. Illustration was created with BioRender.

We selected 13 potential S-protein epitopes predicted to be presented by HLA-A*02:01, some of them shared 100% sequence homology with SARS-CoV and were previously shown to be immunogenic (Table1). Total magnitude of S-protein directed CD8+ response was in some patients less than 0.1% from the total CD8+ population, so we decided to perform rapid in vitro antigen-specific expansion according to the protocol which was previously proposed to expand antigen-specific cells from the memory subpopulation (36) . Epitope-specific cells were detected by flow cytometry using MHC-tetramers (Fig.3a,b) . Strikingly, 12 of 14 CPs with HLA-A*02:01 allele reacted to a single epitope of S-protein269-277 YLQPRTFLL (YLQ), while only 1 HD(Cov) had the cells recognizing this epitope. The response to the second epitope S-protein1000-1008 RLQSLQTYV (RLQ) was also, though to a somewhat lesser extent, pointing to the past COVID-19 (Fig.3a) . Share of the positive wells in expansion for both epitopes could be used to confirm previous COVID-19 (Fig.3c) . Almost complete absence of the response to these epitopes in HD confirmed that the detected antigen-specific cells were derived from the memory subpopulation. The remaining 11 of the tested epitopes yielded only sporadic T-cell response (Fig.3a) .",

Strong biases observed for gene usage might suggest the importance of germlineencoded features in TCR recognition of RLQ and YLQ epitopes and is reminiscent of previously reported TRAV12 bias for the Yellow fever virus LLW epitope (38, 39) We performed TCR sequence similarity analysis to extract the set of motifs that governs the recognition of RLQ and YLQ epitopes (see Materials and Methods). Our analysis revealed a set of three distinct CDR3 alpha and three distinct CDR3 beta motifs, each containing more than 10 highly similar sequences coming from YLQ-specific T-cells (Fig.4c) . Interestingly, all of the motifs were encountered in most of the donors surveyed ( Fig.4d) , suggesting the public nature of the response and little difference between motifs in terms of publicity. Moreover, some YLQ-specific TCRs were shared between multiple individuals and others exhibited a high degree of global similarity (Extended Data Fig.4 ). No significant correlation in frequency was observed between pairs of TRA and TRB motifs, suggesting that the pairing between motifs of different chains may be entirely random, in line with recent observations (40) . Position-weight matrices of the motifs demonstrate a set of highly dissimilar consensuses (Fig.4e) suggesting that while RLQ-and YLQ-specific TCR repertoires are highly public, they are also diverse.",

Analysis of cluster sharing across donors (Fig.5d) revealed that most clusters are private to donors that is expected as donors have multiple unmatched HLAs and cells are stimulated with whole protein, however, there were 9 CD4+ and 8 CD8+ clusters shared between stimulated cells of multiple donors (Fig.5e) . One of the \"public\" clusters (C2 in Fig.5e ) contains sequences matching those found in YLQ-specific T-cells and was further explored by mapping it to unstimulated PBMC samples of all donors (Fig.5f ). Exploring both stimulated IFN\u03b3-producing CD8+ cells and PBMCs revealed a set of TCR sequences in multiple donors matching those of cluster C2, all sharing the same highly conserved CDR3 motif \"CASS[YD]SDTGELFF\".

Two patients (p1472 and p1473) had no detectable antibody levels in the serum to any of the tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens and no T-cellular response to any of the peptide pools, albeit they had T-cells reactive to the recombinant S-protein. One possible explanation is the delayed seroconversion (blood was sampled at 22 and 36 days since the onset of symptoms or positive PCR test) though it contradicts the recent study reporting that antibodies develop in 100% patients sampled at days 17-19 (47) . Other possibility is the false positive PCR test. In our study detection of anti-RBD IgG yielded more reliable results than other antigens we tested. Also we observed a moderate correlation of anti-RBD antibody levels. It is in accordance with previously published data (16, 48) . It was previously demonstrated that titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies positively correlate with patient age (16) . In our cohort we did not observe that (Extended Data Fig.2e-h) .",

Our findings are in line with that with a caveat that we observed the significant increase of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein reactive T-cells in healthy donors sampled during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig.2c,d) . Combined with the complete lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in that group this suggests that some of the donors may have had contact with SARS-CoV-2 before blood sampling. Due to cross-reactivity induced by other coronaviruses their T cells might have protected them from developing the full scale infection. This is illustrated by the case of p1477 who cohabited with COVID-19 patient but was negative in multiple PCR tests, did not have any COVID-19 typical or flu-like symptoms and had no detectable antibodies to any of the SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

But previous studies show that CD4+ T cells react to stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S-protein in particular) by Th1-type response (31) . In another study IFN\u03b3 was also the predominant cytokine produced by memory T cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides (23).",

IFN\u03b3-producing T-cell repertoires featured multiple groups of homologous TCR sequences that are in a good agreement with TCR variants found to be enriched based on corresponding clonal abundances. Thus, we were able to identify hundreds of TCR motifs, some of which were shared across multiple donors. Interestingly, only one of the detected motifs was found in tetramer positive CD8+ T-cell fraction, suggesting that immediate response may be targeting a wealth of distinct S-protein epitopes, some of which are presented by HLA alleles other than A*02. This single motif, however, displayed extensive sharing between donors and was also found in an unstimulated PBMC fraction.",

Despite antigen-specific expansion being performed for all peptides to detect even the small T-cell clones, we observed consistent epitope-specific response to only 2 of 13 peptides (Fig.3a) . In particular we did not see a strong response to RLN peptide despite its previously reported immunodominance in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients (46) . KLP-specific T cells were detected only in 1 convalescent patient, contrary to study with SARS-CoV-1 (34), which showed this epitope to be highly immunogenic in convalescent patients but not healthy donors. KLP peptide of SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV-1 by single amino acid substitution (M-T), whereas RLN peptides are 100% homologs. This lack of the immune response to homologous epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 convalescents may be attributed to the existence of more immunodominant epitopes, that elicit T cell expansion, which crowds out RLN-and KLP-specific T cells. It was previously shown that T-cell immune response in healthy donors is focused predominantly on epitopes in C-terminal part of SARC-CoV-2 S-protein which may be explained by higher homology of this region with common cold coronaviruses (Braun) . In our study only one epitope (YLQ) was derived from the N-terminal part of the S-protein, but indeed we saw almost no response to this epitope by healthy donors.",

To compare the samples within one plate, as well as normalize the values across the different plates and compare them, we performed the serial dilutions of p1484 serum (from 1:200 to 1:51200) in each plate. A sigmoid four-parameter logistic (4PL) fitting curves model was used to fit the calibration curve based on the serial dilution. For each plate, an EC50 value (the half OD between the top and bottom segment of a curve) was used as a coefficient of normalization. The mean of two OD values for each sample was divided by the coefficient of normalization for the given plate. For group comparison Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's multiple comparison test was used.",

Briefly, the TCR similarity network was constructed allowing a single amino acid substitution in CDR3 sequence (Hamming distance of 1), the number of similar sequences (\"neighbors\") for each CDR3 was counted and compared to the expected number of neighbors predicted using a reference dataset containing ~10 7 amino acid sequences of either TCR alpha and beta chains. CDR3 sequences having more neighbors than would be expected at random were considered to be representative (\"core\") sequences, TCR motifs were defined as connected components of TCR similarity network containing at least one core sequence. A similar analysis was performed to detect TCR motifs in pooled IFN\u03b3+ fractions of stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, except for using a control made from pooled PBMC repertoire of corresponding donors and counting neighbors based on CDR3 nucleotide sequences as described in (37) .
