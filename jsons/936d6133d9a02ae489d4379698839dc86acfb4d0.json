The reproducibility of SELDI spectra, mass location, and intensity from spectrum to spectrum was determined accordingly. ologic significance (phenomic fingerprints) in crude biological and clinical samples by SELDI-TOF MS has been demonstrated in various cancer studies (28 ) . Using a similar profiling strategy, we have established a classification algorithm that delineates probable SARS patients as early as day 1 after self-described onset of symptoms from healthy individuals and from patients with respiratory tract infections in the training set (sensitivity \u03ed 100%; specificity \u03ed 97.3%). When applied to the blinded test set, this discriminatory profiling method precisely classified 97.3% of patients with acute SARS and 99.4% of non-SARS patients. More strikingly, our classifier was able to discriminate SARS-CoV infection from bacterial (mycoplasma, tuberculosis) and other local (influenza) or systemic (measles) viral infections of the respiratory tract with a specificity reaching 100%. This was attributable to the inclusion of corresponding inflammatory control samples in the training set and optimization of the classification algorithm. The biomarkers identified in the acute phase of SARS seemed to remain throughout the convalescent phase of the disease because when we applied the identical tree classification to samples from patients in whom onset of fever had been \u03fe2, 3, 4, and \u03fe5 weeks previously, we could detect SARS with sensitivities and specificities reaching 89.2% and 91.8%, 86.0% and 91.8%, 93.1% and 91.8%, and 79.5% and 91.8%, respectively (data not shown). One intriguing observation was that SARS patients clustering in terminal node 3 all demonstrated moderate clinical features, whereas those in node 5 were severe cases. We are investigating the correlation between this proteomic pattern and the pathology of SARS. These results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the most accurate laboratory technique for early detection of SARS: PCR-based assays have a maximum sensitivity of 80% when used to test nasopharyngeal aspirates or plasma specimens (29, 30 ) . The proteomic method described here also has advantages over PCR-based assays in that it does not require BSL-3 containment and it can detect SARS in serum samples. This is a critical alternative to PCR-based tests, which are challenged by low viral loads in nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat swab specimens in the acute phase of SARS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 607, "end": 612, "text": "(28 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2434, "end": 2438, "text": "(29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2443, "text": "30 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Instead of traditional chromatographic fractionation of samples, we directly spotted the crude serum on the WCX chips.

We further emphasized this point by sampling control sera from a nonepidemic region of the country. Although the possibility might exist that the difference in serum fingerprints would reflect differences among SARS and non-SARS hospitals, the fact that all SARS cases from 38 different hospitals fit into the single classification algorithm would likely rule out such a concern. More importantly, severe and mild cases of SARS from different hospitals, which had been completely randomized in the experimental analysis, fell into distinct nodes of the tree classification, strongly indicating that the biomarkers we have identified were specific to SARS and not the sites at which blood samples were collected. We further minimized the potential sampling bias by simultaneously using four biomarkers instead of one (e.g., m/z 3939.08), which nevertheless could sufficiently delineate SARS from non-SARS (sensitivity \u03ed 93.7%; specificity \u03ed 91.8%; data not shown).
