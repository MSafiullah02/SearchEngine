The experiment using feline monocytes from SPF cats was performed as follows: FIPV strain 79-1146 (1 \u00d7 104\n TCID50) reacted with or without MAb 6-4-2 was added to the culture and adsorbed to the feline monocytes at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After washing, cells were cultured in medium containing chloroquine, and culture supernatants and cells were collected after 2 days. The experiment using feline monocytes from cats with FIP (FIP cats) was performed as follows: feline monocytes were cultured in medium containing chloroquine, and culture supernatants and cells were collected after 2 days. As the virus titer in the culture supernatant, TCID50 was calculated. Cells were used to measure cytokine mRNA, and FCoV N genes.",

In contrast, virus proliferation was inhibited in chloroquine-treated monocytes, i.e., chloroquine inhibited the FIPV-induced ADE activity of monocytes. In addition, a significant inhibitory effect on FIPV gene expression was noted in cells with Pre/Post treatment. In contrast, no significant inhibitory effect was noted in cells with Post treatment, and the treatment of FIPV-infected monocytes collected from FIP cats with chloroquine did not change FIPV N gene expression, suggesting that the treatment of cells already infected with FIPV with chloroquine induces no antiviral effect.",

In this study, chloroquine significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression levels in FIPV-infected monocytes. The mechanism of inhibiting inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression by chloroquine is still unclear. Weber and Levitz (2000) suggested the presence of lysosomotropic and non-lysosomotropic mechanisms in the chloroquine-induced inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 production. The former inhibits TNF-\u03b1 release from cells and the latter inhibits TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression and transcription, which suggests that the significant inhibition of inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression levels by chloroquine in FIPV-infected monocytes involves the non-lysosomotropic mechanism. However, in a more recent paper by Jang et al. (2006), it was shown that chloroquine does inhibit TNF-\u03b1 release, but does not change the TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels or the synthesis of the TNF-\u03b1 precursor. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Furthermore, in addition to the lowering of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA was decreased. Jang et al. (2006) reported that the stability of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA was decreased by chloroquine. In the present study, the same mechanisms might decrease the expression of cytokine mRNA.",
