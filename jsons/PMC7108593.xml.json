Enrolled patients had stool obtained at diagnosis and weeks 4, 12, and 52 after diagnosis. Clinical observation during the PROTECT study revealed clusters of severe cases suggesting a possible environmental trigger such as viral infection. The aim of this study was to examine the gastrointestinal virome of children with newly diagnosed UC to explore the role of viruses in triggering UC. To enhance the likelihood of successful detection of viral nucleic acid, we employed VirCapSeq-VERT, a viral template enrichment platform that uses ~2 million probes that cover the genomes of 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates.9,10 The use of VirCapSeq-VERT results in a 100- to 10,000-fold enrichment of viral sequences over standard metagenomic methods. This method is highly useful in instances where viral sequences represent only a small proportion of overall genetic material present in clinical specimens.",

Adaptor trimming was followed by generation of quality reports using FastQC software (v 0.11.5); these were used to determine filtering criteria based on the average quality scores of the reads, presence of indeterminate nucleotides, and homopolymeric reads. The reads were quality filtered and end-trimmed with PRINSEQ software (v 0.20.3). Host background levels were determined by mapping filtered reads against a human reference database using Bowtie2 mapper (v 2.2.9). The host-subtracted reads were de novo assembled using MIRA (4.0) assembler. Contigs and unique singletons were subjected to homology search using Megablast against the GenBank nucleotide database. Sequences that showed low or no homology at the nucleotide level were subjected to a BLASTX homology search against the viral GenBank protein database. Viral sequences from BLASTX analysis were subjected to another round of BLASTX homology search against the entire GenBank protein database to correct for biased E values and taxonomic mis-assignments. Based on the contigs identified for different viral strains, GenBank sequences were downloaded and used for mapping the whole data set to recover partial or complete genomes. Viral read numbers were obtained from counting the number of reads mapping to contig sequences and unassembled singletons, and percentages were calculated in relation to the total read number obtained.",

In addition, we repeated the logistic regression model replacing the independent variable with the number of viruses present or presence of any virus. Because of the quasi-complete or complete separation phenomenon caused by the low prevalence of certain viruses, we applied a penalized likelihood based method to reduce potential bias.13 To determine virus association with disease severity within cases at baseline, we conducted the same logistic regression models replacing the dependent variable with the binary severity status. Age, sex, and Mayo endoscopy score were adjusted for as potential confounding variables. Furthermore, we examined the association between virus presence and clusters (vs nonclusters) using the same logistic regression models.",

Anelloviruses are ubiquitous in humans, although their exact prevalence is difficult to estimate because their extremely high sequence divergence impedes epidemiological surveys.42 It is estimated that more than 90% of the human worldwide population is infected with at least 1 type of anellovirus.42, 43 Although they have been detected in fluid and tissue samples representing a wide range of human diseases, they are also found in in healthy individuals.43\u201349 Some studies suggest that anelloviruses may impact the severity of inflammation through the regulation of inflammatory cytokine homeostasis.

However, enrollment was limited to only 70 UC patients with moderate to severe disease activity. We do not know, therefore, whether our findings apply to those with mild disease. We do not have detailed dietary history on the UC subjects because their inclusion in PROTECT only began at their diagnostic colonoscopy. We recognize other limitations in our study. Adolescents with IBS\u2014and not healthy children\u2014were used as controls. Though there are no data suggesting alterations in stool virome in IBS, an altered microbiome has been reported in IBS.50 We only analyzed stool specimens and not rectal biopsy tissue, potentially limiting viral detection. A potential limitation of our capture approach is that it is based on probes designed from viral sequences that have been deposited in Genbank. While we cannot exclude the possibility that yet uncharacterized viruses with extreme genetic diversity would escape detection, VirCapSeq-VERT can detect novel viruses with as little as 60% nucleotide identity to viruses present in the probe set. We also acknowledge that this pilot survey represents a limited sample set and is not a prospective full scale epidemiologic study. Nonetheless, our findings do not support a role of an active viral infection in the onset of UC and may shift the focus toward other potential infectious, genetic, or environmental triggers.",
