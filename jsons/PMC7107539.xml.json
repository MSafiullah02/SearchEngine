These recognition phenomena involve the association of proteins to ligands or substrates. One of the most important molecular recognitions is that performed between lymphocytes and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Natural killer (NK) cells\u2014one of the lymphocyte classes\u2014detect downregulation of MHC class I molecules by means of specific membrane receptors. A main category of these receptors is the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family. These KIR genes have evolved in primates to generate a diverse family of receptors with unique structures that enable them to recognize MHC class I molecules with locus and allele specificity (Vilches and Parham 2002). Their combinatorial expression creates a repertoire of NK cells that antagonize the spread of pathogens and tumors.",

While vertebrate hemoglobins have evolved, conserving their ability to bind ligands and deliver oxygen molecules bound at the heme sites, many functionally important structural differences were found to exist among vertebrate hemoglobins (Naoi et al. 2001).

Only four amino acids in the receptor-binding domain differ between the human epidemic and the civet strains, but they cause more than a 1,000-fold difference in the binding affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a specific receptor glycoprotein on the surface of host cells (Li et al. 2005).

The SSF is calculated empirically based on amino acid preferences and pairwise interactions in the structural environment present in templates' structure. In the present study, we used the SSF to develop an index to measure the binding affinity of protein\u2013protein complexes defined as the log likelihood ratio, contrasting the fitness of the sequences to the structure of the complex and that of the uncomplexed proteins. This index enables us to quantify the binding affinity between proteins.

On the other hand, antibodies covering the receptor-binding region of HA by direct binding to the receptor binding sites completely lost their binding abilities along the HA evolutionary pathway. We also found that the binding ability of these antibodies to HA started to increase after a couple of years in an impotent stage, and this binding ability was restored to a magnitude comparable to the original, prompting HA to evade them again.",

However, our log likelihood ratio may depend too greatly on the pattern of categorization to reliably estimate the binding ability and its variation. To avoid this problem, we adopted the sliding-window approach to achieve a balance between robust estimation of conditional probabilities and sensitive detection of changes in microstructure. In other words, we estimated the amino acid preference and the pairwise interaction in a local environment using the proportions of the corresponding amino acids or amino acid pairs out of all residues or pairs of residues in a similar environment.

We further examined the correlation between our index and the measured value for the complex between tumor endothelial marker (TEM)-1 \u03b2-lactamase and its inhibitory protein. The hydrolysis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics by class A \u03b2-lactamases is a common cause of bacterial resistance to these agents. The \u03b2-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) binds and inhibits several class A \u03b2-lactamases, including TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase. To identify the residues on BLIP that contribute to its binding affinity, Zhang and Palzkill (2003) carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis and contrasted the binding abilities of 23 mutants and one double mutant with that of the wild type. The X-ray crystallography data for the complex is also available in PDB (PDB code: 1JTG; Lim et al. 2001). Therefore we compared our predicted binding abilities with the measured values (Table 2 in Zhang and Palzkill 2003).",

Influenza viruses continue to evolve and new antigenic variants constantly emerge (antigenic drift) (Webster et al. 1992). In the influenza A viruses of humans and other mammals, antibodies play a role in the selection of mutants (Webster 2000). This enables influenza A viruses to evade the host immune system, decreasing the ability to form antibody\u2013antigen complexes. This causes re-infection of hosts with pre-existing antibodies and allows the influenza virus to persist in human populations. Gubareva, Novikov, and Hayden (2002) showed that amino acid changes accompanying transmission among humans accumulated in HA and that these changes might be related to antibody pressure (Lipatov et al. 2004).

The overall structure of the H3 HA protein of a duck virus (A/duck/Ukraine/63, PDB data: 1MQL, Ha et al. 2003) is very similar to that of a human (A/Aichi/68). In fact, the root-mean-square deviation, which measures the average spatial distance of corresponding amino acid residues, was only 0.06 nm between avian HA (1MQL) and human HA (1KEN) after structural alignment. The majority of the sequences (248 sequences) were analyzed by Smith et al.

The influenza A virus entry protein is the HA glycoprotein, and hence HA is a target of attack by the immune system. Several different neutralization mechanisms have been described (Knossow et al. 2002). In general, an antibody binds to the surface of the membrane-distal domain of HA. Knossow and collaborators have determined the structures of complexes formed between the influenza A (H3N2) virus (A/Aichi/68) HA and the monoclonal antibodies HC19 and HC63 (PDB code: 2VIR and 1KEN; Barbey-Martin et al. 2002; Bizebard et al. 1995). While bound HC63 Fab extends from HA within the space projected radially from the HA trimer, HC19 Fab binds on the side of the HA trimer (Knossow et al. 2002). Both antibodies cover the receptor binding region of HA. Fleury et al. (2000) described the structures of complexes formed between HA of the influenza A (H3N2) virus (A/Aichi/68) and the antibody fragments of HC45 and BH151 (PDB code: 1QFU and 1EO8). Both HC45 and BH151 Fabs bind not to the receptor-binding region but to a region closer to the membrane. However, their large sizes make these antibodies highly efficient at neutralization (Fleury et al. 1999). The complex structural data for HC45 and BH151 suggested that definite flexibility exists in the selection of antibodies that bind to a given epitope (Fleury et al. 2000). Although variable domains of antibodies HC45 and BH151 display only 56% sequence identity, they bind to very closely related epitopes on HA with nearly identical dissociation constants.",

It should be noted that the value of experiment depends on the scale (in this case, the scale is nM). Hence, only the relative relations are informative. The data points represent 23 single amino acid mutations and one double amino acid mutation. The structural data (PDB code: 1JTG) included two measurements. Pairs connected by solid lines represent the variation of our binding affinity caused by the variation of structural measurement. The root-mean-square deviations between the two structural data were 0.02 nm for TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase and 0.01 nm for the inhibitory protein. Although the differences between two structural data were small, amino acid mutations on some residues caused non-negligible differences between the calculations with the two structural data. In order to take account of those variables, we performed the regression analysis with weighted least squares to estimate the relation,(7)Here Kd is the dissociation constant measured by the experiment. The best weight should be inversely proportional to the variance of the error term. Therefore we defined the weight as the inverse of squared difference between the two predicted values of the binding affinity. We observed positive correlation (r = 0.33). The regression coefficients were \u03b1 = 2.27(0.04) and \u03b2 = 0.048(0.020) (the numbers in parentheses are standard errors).

The binding ability to the A/Finland/247/92 isolate was completely lost (the result of Equation 1 was negative). Along these two branches, the binding ability decreased by a different mechanism. At the first branch, the decrease in binding ability was caused by the amino acid replacement G158E in HA1. The interaction between the one hundred fifty-eighth site in HA1 and the CDR2H and CDR3L regions of the Fab largely decreased their strength. Furthermore, glutamic acid (E, acidic amino acid) does not prefer to be buried. As a result, the FSR of the one hundred fifty-eighth site in HA1 decreased from logFSR(158G) = 0.83 to logFSR(158E) = \u22120.77. By the same mechanism, another drastic decrease occurred on the twig-branch between A/Aichi/68 and A/Memphis/1/71. At the second mentioned branch on the trunk, the decrease in the binding ability was caused by the amino acid replacement S157L in HA1. The interaction between the one hundred fifty-eighth site in HA1 and the CDR1H and CDR2H regions of the Fab largely decreased their strength. In this case, leucine (L, a nonpolar amino acid) prefers to be buried. However, the decrease in the interaction strength was larger than the contribution of the one hundred fifty-eighth site's burial preference. The FSR of the one hundred fifty-eighth site in HA1 decreased from logFSR(157S) = 0.65 to logFSR(157L) = \u22120.49.",

Conversely, few side chains changed their orientation and, hence, local changes occurred in the HA structure. This implies that the organization of hydrogen bonds and the strength of the hydrophobic interaction are the result of the complicated process of protein docking. Because of these changes in microstructure via rotation of side chains, accurately predicting the complex structure from the structure of uncomplexed HA and Fab is difficult (Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala 2003). Therefore, we decided to extract grossly the change in microstructures reflected by the extent of the amino acid preference in the local environment. The change in the ability of rotation of the side chains is expected to be at least partly detected as a change in the log likelihood ratios.",

Both of these antibodies completely lost their binding ability for a period of time on the evolutionary pathway of HA. After this complete loss of binding ability, antibody HC63 started to increase its ability, and over 10 years, the ability to bind to HA was restored. When the virus was free from antibody HC63, amino acid substitutions accumulated, and they enabled antibody HC63 to again bind to the same epitope region. However, the amino acid substitutions were not simply back mutations of the substitutions causing reduced binding ability.

This is functional redundancy, and antibodies employ this feature to bind to the HA surface. One of the remarkable properties of binding between proteins is redundancy (Dang, Nikolajczyk, and Sen 1998), a term for the feature where mutations at several protein-binding sites do not affect the affinity of the complex (Fields et al. 1995). In general, the physicochemical characteristics of protein are known to be evolutionarily conserved (Afonnikov, Oshchepkov, and Kolchanov 2001). By functional redundancy of antibodies, different antibodies whose variable domains display low sequence identities can bind to the same epitope region on HA. Hence, it may be true that antibodies do not require specific amino acid sequences of the epitope region on HA. The HA sequence, particularly in the receptor-binding region, changes under the selective pressure of the host immune system. After disarmament of the immune system, the HA protein regresses to the functionally same structural state as the original protein. Then the disarmed antibody can again bind to its epitope on HA, and HA sequence evolution is again under selective pressure. During the antibody's period of impotency, the other antibody that bound to the closely related epitope region preserved its ability to bind to the epitopes. This \u201carms race\u201d is a competition between the virus's changing the sequences of the epitope regions at the cost of structural change and the immune system's producing sets of functionally redundant antibodies.",

One potential application of this index is the monitoring and prediction of the arms race between natural ligands and inhibitors that are bound by enzymes, where enzyme activity depends on the relative strengths of its binding affinities to the ligand and the inhibitor. Therefore, comparing the two indices will be essential. We hope that the efficiency of our likelihood-based index of binding affinities increases with the growth of structural information.",
