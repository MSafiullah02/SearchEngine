In this situation, some guidelines recommend a trial of antibiotics, a widely practiced approach entailing a few days of broad-spectrum antibiotics that are inactive against tuberculosis. This approach assumes that symptom persistence despite a trial of antibiotics implies that tuberculosis is probable, and that improvement on a trial of antibiotics rules out tuberculosis.2 However, these assumptions have been the subject of remarkably little research and are undermined by issues such as antibiotic resistance and the placebo effect.",

            "text": "In a systematic review and meta-analysis in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Titus Divala and colleagues3 evaluated a trial of antibiotics as if it were a diagnostic test for tuberculosis. After screening 9410 publications, they identified eight studies in which patients with initially negative rapid tuberculosis tests were treated with a trial of antibiotics, the response to which was compared with the subsequent results of more sensitive laboratory testing for tuberculosis. Of the 2786 patients who had a trial of antibiotics, overall 608 patients (22% [range 4\u201365]) were later found to have laboratory-proven tuberculosis. The crude results of these eight studies are summarised in the figure\n, which shows that whether patients' symptoms persisted on a trial of antibiotics did not usefully predict laboratory-proven tuberculosis. For example, overall, 1307 (47% [range 6\u201376]) of 2786 patients had symptoms that persisted despite a trial of antibiotics, implying that they had tuberculosis, but remarkably only 454 (35% [range 11\u201384]) of 1307 patients with persistent symptoms were later found to have laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis. Furthermore, 154 patients (25% [range 3\u201385]) of 608 patients later found to have laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis paradoxically improved on a trial of antibiotics, an improvement that should have ruled out this tuberculosis diagnosis. These crude percentages are complementary to the rigorous random effects meta-analysis reported by Divala and colleagues, which suggested that a trial of antibiotics had pooled sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 42\u201385) and specificity of 73% (58\u201385) versus mycobacteriology tests. This poor performance of a trial of antibiotics has important implications for policy and practice.3\n",

These findings are approximations because tuberculosis laboratory testing might be false positive,5 and because false-negative laboratory tests in patients who have tuberculosis are frequent.6 Furthermore, molecular testing was only included in the initial rapid testing in one of these eight studies,7 but it has since become widely used for diagnosing tuberculosis.1 None of these issues are likely to challenge Divala and colleagues' conclusion that a trial of antibiotics is unreliable for informing tuberculosis diagnosis.",

Both questions are answered in part by the chronic severe underfunding of tuberculosis research.1, 10 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency and resultant socioeconomic crisis will inevitably worsen the global tuberculosis pandemic by increasing tuberculosis risk factors and social determinants, and challenging health systems and access to them. It is striking that long before mortality attributed to COVID-19 approaches 1\u00b75 million\u2014the number of deaths caused by tuberculosis each year\u2014there has been unprecedented investment in research that is rapidly defining how best to care for people with suspected COVID-19.
