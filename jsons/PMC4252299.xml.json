            "text": "Meat and meat products are the source of numerous enteric infections in humans. Enteric viruses harbored by farmed animals may contaminate meat samples during slaughter and meat preparation (Machnowska et al., 2014). Hepatitis E virus (HEV) replicating in domesticated or wild-pigs can also be transmitted to human through undercooked pork consumption (Christou and Kosmidou, 2013, Meng, 2013). At slaughter time (22\u201329 weeks), HEV was present in 12% and 41% of the plasmas and stools from Canadian pigs, respectively (Leblanc et al., 2007). Viral transmission between farm animal species or between domesticated and wild animals may also occur increasing risk of adaptation to new host and changes in viral tropism (Ma et al., 2009, Sonnberg et al., 2013). Transmission of viruses in meat or blood may also occur through non-enteric routes such as skin cuts occurring during hunting and butchering as seen for simian T-lymphotropic and simian foamy virus (Betsem et al., 2011, Gessain et al., 2013, Switzer et al., 2004). Cross-species transmissions, likely due to hunting and/or butchering non-human primates, initiated various HIV epidemics (HIV-1 groups M, N, O, P and HIV-2 groups A\u2013H) (Sharp and Hahn, 2011) and Ebola virus outbreaks (Leroy et al., 2004). The possibility of bovine viruses playing a role in carcinogenesis has been raised based on the association of colorectal cancer with consumption of under-cooked beef (Zur Hausen, 2012).",

The early region and late region were separated by a regulatory region that contained typical polyomavirus features (Pipas, 1992) including an AT-rich region on the left side of the putative replication origin. Four repeats of the consensus pentanucleotide LT-Ag binding site GAGGC were present. In polyomaviruses VP3 is translated by a leaky ribosomal scanning starting at an internal methionine codon of the larger VP2 ORF. The known polyomaviruses can be divided into \u201cVP3+\u201d species with a clear homolog of the VP3 N-terminal MALXX\u03a6 motif (\u03a6 is an aromatic residue) and \u201cVP3-less\u201d species lacking the motif (Schowalter and Buck, 2013). Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome of known polyomaviruses revealed that VP3-less species cluster together into a monophyletic clade to which BpyV2-SF also belongs (Fig. 1B). Sequence analysis reveals that BpyV2-SF fits the characteristics of VP3-less polyomavirus species, such as having an ALTO protein within the LT-Ag frame, lacking the VP3 N-terminal MALXX\u03a6 motif, and missing ~80 aa near the carboxyl terminus of the VP2 compared with the longer VP3+ species (Schowalter and Buck, 2013).",

PCR screening with a set of nested primers designed on the sequence detected in this study confirmed that two out of the 10 beef samples were positive. In order to clarify whether this sequence was from a circular DNA molecular, inverse PCR was performed and the amplicon sequenced showing that this circular DNA was 859 bases (named mini PCV-like virus strain MPCLV-SFBeef), shorter than the 1202 bases sequence of the original PorkNW2 genome (\nFig. 2). Although BLASTx search revealed a partial putative Rep protein (153 aa) with 97% amino acid sequence similarity to SFPorkNW2 [30], no suitably located ATG initiator codon was identified. Protein analysis indicated that the Rep protein of SFBeef is 68Aa shorter than that of SFPorkNW2, missing the RNA helicase domain. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that both genomes contain a identical stem-loop lying upstream of Rep open reading frame with the conserved origin of replication NANTATTAC nonamer atop the stem-loop found in members of the Circoviridae, Nanoviridae and Geminiviridae families. Another ORF potentially encoding 243 aa protein arranged in the same coding direction as Rep protein was also found yielding an ORF map similar to that of NW2 (Fig. 2A and B). BLASTp search indicated part of the putative protein (60 aa) shared 47% amino acid sequence identity with the M169 protein of unknown function of Murid herpesvirus (GenBank no. HE610454).",

Sequences from a third parvovirus species in a third genus (ungulate protoparvovirus 1) were also detected. Last, a fourth set of parvovirus-like sequences closest to a still unclassified copiparvoviruses labeled porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6 deposited March 31, 2014 GenBank NC_023860) from pigs in China were also detected. Because PPV6 NS1 shows closest identity to PPV4 but with only 58% identity it likely represents a new copriparvovirus species (proposed name ungulate copiparvovirus 3) (Cotmore et al., 2014). Four parvovirus species in three distinct Parvoviridae genera were therefore detected in these few pork samples.",

The genus Gyrovirus is currently in the Circoviridae family but closer (although still distinct) in genetic organization to members of the Anelloviridae (Hino and Prasetyo, 2009). Here sequences from six different gyroviruses were detected in the chicken meat samples: chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus 1 (HGyV1) and the very closely related gyrovirus 2 (GyV2), GyV3, GyV4 and a novel gyrovirus here named GyV7. BLASTx search indicated that the known gyroviruses found here shared high protein sequence identities (>92%) with their best matches in the GenBank, while the novel gyrovirus (GyV7-SF) showed only 57% protein sequence similarity to its closest matches (Table 1). PCR screening with a set of nested primers designed on the novel sequences indicated that only one chicken sample was positive for GyV7-SF. The complete circular genome of GyV7-SF1 was acquired using inverse PCR and Sanger sequencing (GenBank KM111536). The GyV7-SF genome is 2439 bases, with a 514 base non-translated region (NTR) and a polyadenylation signal [AATAAA]. ORF prediction revealed three overlapping ORFs for VP1 (465-aa), VP2 (238-aa) and VP3/Apoptin (130-aa). The genome organization of GyV7-SF was similar to that of the other gyroviruses (\nFig. 3A). BLASTp search based on VP1, VP2, and VP3 all revealed the best match with GyV6 (NC_022789), with protein sequence identities of 49%, 53%, and 63%, respectively. Phylogenetic based the three major protein sequence all indicated that GyV7-SF clustered loosely with GyV6 (Fig. 3B\u2013D), which was detected in diarrhea samples from Tunisian children (Gia Phan et al., 2013).",

Some parvovirus can be highly pathogenic, notoriously canine parvovirus which recently adapted from cats to dogs possibly through intermediate species (Stucker et al., 2012) and is thought to be readily transmitted across carnivore species (Allison et al., 2013). Parvoviruses can also be detected in blood as exemplified by PARV4 (primate tetraparvovirus 1) and parvovirus B19 (primate erythroparvovirus 1) which is typically a benign infection but which can cause serious anemia or fetal hydrops in susceptible individuals or when infecting fetus (Feldman et al., 2010, Morinet et al., 2011). Parvovirus B19 can also be deposited in muscles and other tissues where it can be PCR amplified even decades after primary infection (Norja et al., 2006). The detection of ungulate erythroparvovirus 1 virus in beef may therefore reflect either active replication or particle deposition into tissues. Porcine hokovirus (ungulate tetraparvovirus 2) was also found in beef indicating that the tropism of this viral species may include both pigs and cattle.",

The generation of such truncated and rearranged genomes may be related to that seen when viruses are passaged at high multiplicity of infection leading to defective interfering viral particles retaining only essential Cis elements required for genome replication and requiring trans-complementation from a helper virus (Mankertz et al., 1997). A related phenomenon may be the generation of truncated ssDNA circular geminivirus and anellovirus genome when passaged in vitro (De Villiers et al., 2011).",

The gyrovirus genus includes several species, namely avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2) from chicken (Rijsewijk et al., 2011), the closely related HGyV1 from human skin (Sauvage et al., 2011), GyV3 and GyV4 from children feces and chicken meat (Chu et al., 2012, Phan et al., 2012), and GyV5 and GyV6 from children feces (Gia Phan et al., 2013), many of which were also detected in chicken and children feces from South Africa (Smuts, 2014). The characterization of a seventh species of gyrovirus (GyV7) in this limited sampling of chicken indicates that still more gyroviruses from chicken and other birds are likely to be identified. The current lack of report describing gyrovirus sero-conversion in human or replication in mammalian cells indicates that a possible explanation for the frequent detection of gyrovirus DNA in human feces (gyrovirus species GyV3\u2013GyV6) (Chu et al., 2012, Gia Phan et al., 2013, Phan et al., 2012, Phan et al., 2012) and recently cat feces (CAT-CAV) (X.

Two samples of beef, pork, and chicken were purchased from each of five stores except for two stores in which only a single sample of chicken was purchased. The remaining two chicken samples were purchased from a sixth store. All ground meats were purchased already wrapped in plastic labeled with name of national conglomerates. Neat piece of meats was collected and immediately placed in zippered plastic bags. All samples were frozen the same day at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing. None of the meat was butchered or ground in the shops. In order to avoid potential contamination, small inner section of the meat pieces was cut out and used. Meat pieces (~25 mg) were frozen and thawed on dry ice three times, homogenized, filtered, and nuclease treated as previously described to enrich for nucleic acids within viral particles (Li et al., 2013). Remaining total nucleic acid was then isolated using MagMAX\u2122 Viral RNA Isolation Kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer\u05f3s protocol. A library of randomly amplified PCR products from viral RNA and DNA was prepared by using a Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit and sequenced on the MiSeq Illumina platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Six separate pools of nucleic acids from the 30 meat specimens, each pool contained five specimens from the same farm animal species, were generated. The viral nucleic acid pools, containing both DNA and RNA viral sequences, were subjected to reverse transcription reactions with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 100 picomoles of random hexamer primer, followed by a single round of DNA synthesis using Klenow fragment polymerase (New England BioLabs). A library was then constructed using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and then sequenced using the Miseq Illumina platform with 250 bases paired ends with a distinct molecular tag for each pool. Resulting raw reads were trimmed for quality and primer, and de novo assembled into contigs. Sequences and contigs were compared to the GenBank non-redundant protein database using BLASTx with an E-value cutoff of <10\u22125.",
