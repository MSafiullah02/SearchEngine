Despite knowing the modes of transmission, clinical manifestations, and, in some cases, the entire genome of many of these pathogens, we still struggle to understand structures and mechanisms involved in pathogenhost interaction. For many emerging pathogens, such as the SARS virus, an important first goal is to identify how the virus chooses which cells to infect and what molecules facilitate this recognition (2\u20134). This information can provide insight into how the virus affects the host (through defined cellular signaling, for example) and can aid in the development of novel therapeutics against the virus.",

Further, proteins often function in complexes with other proteins or in multimers, and this type of analysis is difficult in twohybrid systems.

We used Ad from serogroup C (type 5) and serogroup B (type 35) to identify interacting proteins. We first produced recombinant protein of the viral polypeptide of these Ads known to be important for host interactions. We then conjugated these proteins to agarose beads and used this complex to purify proteins from cellular membrane proteins or freshly isolated mouse plasma. The purified proteins were then analyzed using MS/MS to identify candidate proteins. Once these proteins were identified, additional assays were used to verify that proteins identified can truly interact with the viral polypeptide. We describe here techniques used to study the interaction between Ad serotype 5 or 35 fiber knobs and cell or plasma proteins. Similar studies can be performed with other serotypes and with other capsid proteins.",

It should be noted that the other proteins identified through MS/MS analysis were confirmed to bind to Ad fiber knob domain in slot-blot assays, and future studies will determine the functional role of these interactions. Despite the complexity of mouse plasma protein composition, we were able to rapidly identify new Ad-interacting partners, which will have implications for Ad vector development.

Fiber knob domains were amplified using primers encompassing the last repeat of the shaft domain and the entire fiber knob domain. The last repeat of the shaft is necessary because it is required for proper trimerization of the recombinant protein.Biotinylation of proteins using the described methods adds a biotin molecule to the lysine residues throughout the peptide. This can theoretically aid in recovery because a single protein can have multiple biotinylation sites that can be used for precipitation, allowing for increased yield. Disadvantages of this technique include an added manipulation of the purified protein. Specifically, biotinylation of lysine residues that are important in proteinprotein interactions might affect the outcome of this method. Testing if the biotinylated protein can still bind to a protein of interest (by either competitive experiments or virus overlay protein blot assays) can help to confirm if a protein retains functionality after biotinylation. The use of the 6-histidine tag also has advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include less manipulation of the protein because it has an incorporated tag as well as the fact that it is likely not involved in interactions because it is (in this example) far from putative interaction sites. Another advantage is that elution of precipitated proteins can be done without contamination with bait proteins (see\nFig. 1). The disadvantages include a potentially weak signal, with only one bait protein per polypeptide, that may not be readily accessible in nondenatured conditions. Further, the Ni2+-agarose beads are not compatible with certain conditions that may be required for protein purification (such as increased EDTA solutions).Using epithelial cell lines such as HeLa cells can often produce large amounts of keratins that tend to contaminate MS/MS samples. The choice of cell type can be determined by identifying those cells likely to produce abundant receptor molecules (e.g., by infectivity assays).Depending on the type of beads used, a second preclearing round can be done, especially if the beads appear to bind to proteins abundant in plasma.To reduce nonspecific binding to Ni2+-NTA beads, add 10 mM imidazole to the wash solution. Also, if nonspecific background binding is high, consider washing samples with PBS in the presence of a nonionic detergent, such as 0.1% NP-40.It is especially important to wash many times when using serum proteins because the abundant proteins like albumin can often contaminate samples even after four washes if less abundant proteins are being analyzed.For better likelihood of successful identification by MS/MS analysis, do not fix the gel with formaldehyde during silver staining.Urea can disrupt trypsin activity and, if this contaminant is too high, will result in suboptimal peptide recovery. A second concentration step can be performed in the same microcon container by again increasing the volume to 500 \u03bcL using PBS and concentrating to 50 \u03bcL. Also, the molecular-weight cutoff of the filter can be adjusted to enrich in particular weights of target proteins.These experiments utilized the convenience of pseudotyped vectors with an easily assayable transgene. These experiments can also be performed with wild-type Ad using cytopathic effect as a primary outcome instead of GFP transgene expression.The choice of HepG2 as a cell line was made because of previous observations that liver infection in vivo by Ad5-based vectors is not CAR dependent and likely is mediated by other serum factors. Using a vector abolished for CAR-binding, we are better able to assay the contribution of our newly discovered blood factors to infection of these human liver-derived cells in the absence of CAR binding.\n",
