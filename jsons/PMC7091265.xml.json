Considering these characteristics, and with further wide-use of pathogen tests, the number of pediatric patients will increase. Based on the collected data, infected children have relatively milder clinical symptomsthan infected adults; and no deaths have been reported in pediatric patients.",

Several gradually presented with fever, fatigue, dry cough, accompanied by other upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, runny nose, and seldom gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examination in pediatric patients showed that blood routine was often normal, and C-reactive protein was normal or transiently elevated.

IFN is the first-line innate immune defense of the body against viral infection. Based on different gene and protein structures, IFN is divided into IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and so on. Interferon mainly plays antiviral effects through two ways: (1) inducing production of antiviral effector proteins, thereby inhibiting viral replication in the cells to protect normal cells from viral invasion; (2) activating cellular immunity by promoting proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), activating natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages to clear the virus. The body\u2019s endogenous IFN deficiency or insufficiency may lead to reduced antiviral activity. Children are susceptible to viral infections because of their immature immune function and relatively low levels of specific humoral and cellular immunity and IFN secretion.",
