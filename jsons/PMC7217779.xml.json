ACE2 is a master regulator of RAAS, and both reduced or increased function of ACE2 can induce systemic and pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and diabetic cardiovascular complications [30]. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, lungs, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, and it plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways. The binding affinity of the novel coronavirus with ACE2 appears to be stronger than the virus that causes SARS, which may explain the significantly higher global influence of COVID-19 than the initial SARS. Potential therapeutic strategies may include preventing the binding of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2.",

These patients had a much more aggressive disease associated with earlier mortality. These data are still not available in COVID-19 patients, but the studies that investigated cardiac injury by elevation of cardiac enzymes showed that the prevalence of cardiac injury is frequent and more prevalent among patients with the lethal outcome [10,13]. Chen et al. recently revealed that human cardiac pericytes have high expression of ACE2, which could be the target cell of SARS-CoV-2 [33]. The virus-induced pericytes damage can provoke capillary endothelial cells dysfunction and further microvascular dysfunction. Patients with heart failure disease at baseline demonstrated elevated ACE2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, which further increases the risk of heart attack and the critically ill condition in patients infected by this coronavirus [33].",

On the other hand, there is more evidence that ARBs modify ACE2 expression [35,36]. Upregulation has been primarily found in the cardiac tissue and in the renal vasculature. However, the results are inconsistent, require high ARBs dosages and vary according to ARB and the organ. Additionally, most investigations measured blood ACE2 activity that reveals the soluble ACE2 protein circulating at very low levels, which is not the same as membrane-bound ACE2. If ARBs upregulated membrane-bound ACE2, it is reasonable to hypothesize that this would be the consequence of AT1 receptor blockade. ACEIs would have a similar effect as ARBs, even though there are only limited data about ACEI-induced upregulation of ACE2. However, the currently available data are mostly obtained in animal studies and could not be directly applied to humans. Therefore, there is no sufficient evidence that ARBs or ACEIs could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and cause COVID-19.",

There was no difference in usage of ACEIs between COVID-19 patients with different severity of disease. There are no data regarding the association between RAAS inhibitors and the outcome. However, the investigators studied the use of RAAS inhibitors only in hypertensive patients, but not in the patients with other indications for ACEI and ARB (heart failure, diabetes, renal impairment). Moreover, the number of patients who were taking ACEIs and ARBs was very low, 7% and 24%, respectively [9]. Interestingly, the percentage of ARBs was significantly higher than ACEIs.",

Several large studies, therefore, concentrated on the effect of ACEI/ARB on morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients and they obtained encouraging results. Li et al. included 1,178 patients with COVID-19, out of which 362 had hypertension and reported that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 patients [38]. A recent large study from Italy that involved 6,272 patients with COVID-19 and 30,759 non-COVID patients showed that the use of ACEIs and ARBs was more frequent among the COVID-19 patients than in the control group due to the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease [39]. Nevertheless, there was no association between ACEI/ARB use and the risk of COVID-19 [39]. An American study that included 5,894 patients with COVID-19 found no association between any single medication class, including RAAS inhibitors, and the positive test for COVID-19 [40]. Mehra et al. involved 8,910 patients with COVID-19 from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America and revealed no association between the use of ACEI/ARB and the increased in-hospital mortality [41].",

Moreover, ACEI or ARB treatment increased the level of CD3 and CD8 T cell in peripheral blood and reduced the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs. These findings were the first evidence which supports the benefit of ACEIs or ARBs in COVID-19 patients with hypertension because they can potentially improve clinical outcomes in these patients. The authors hypothesized that RAAS inhibitors did not directly inhibit the viral replication, but had an indirect antiviral role by regulation of the immune function and inhibition of the inflammatory response. Nevertheless, the potential mechanisms need to be clarified in the future large human studies. A large study that included 1,128 hypertensive patients with COVID-19 showed that inpatient use of ACEI/ARB, after adjustment for age, gender and comorbidities, was related with lower all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users [42]. Further analysis revealed that the use of RAAS inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension in comparison to the use of other antihypertensive drugs [42].",
