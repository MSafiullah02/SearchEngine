This review focuses on these viruses as respiratory pathogens, particularly group C adenoviruses as significant infective agents of the lower respiratory tract. Whereas most adenovirus infections are mild and self-limiting, considerable morbidity and even death can occur in the pediatric population, in military recruits and in immunocompromised individuals [2]. Adenovirus persistence or latency supports the possibility that, as a consequence of immunosuppression, the otherwise quiescent virus, either in the recipient host or in the transplanted donor organ, is reactivated to cause more serious disease. The paucity of treatment options to control these infections emphasizes the urgent need for well-controlled clinical trials of the therapeutic modalities currently in development.",

This review summarizes evidence supporting this hypothesis from lung tissue of COPD patients, from an animal model and from lung epithelial cells, in which the mechanisms by which E1A could enhance the inflammatory response in lungs of patients to promote emphysema have been studied [3]. More recent advances in our understanding of these mechanisms are presented, as well as results supporting the role of adenovirus E1A in the airway remodeling observed in COPD.",

            "text": "The icosahedral capsid of adenovirus is composed of hexon and penton proteins [2, 4\u2022, 5]. The fiber protein that protrudes from the 12 vertices formed by the penton bases has a knob domain that serves as a ligand for receptors on the host cell. The knob domain of group A, C, D, E and F adenoviruses attaches to the coxsackie B virus and adenovirus receptor on the host cell surface, whereas that of group B viruses, except for serotypes 3 and 7, attaches to CD46 [7]. This binding facilitates further interactions between the penton base and members of the integrin family, predominantly \u03b1V\u03b21,3,5, which are required for internalization of the virus. The details of adenovirus internalization, including fiber shedding, endocytosis, and release from endosomes with loss of the penton bases, are reviewed in [4\u2022] and [8]. The viral capsid is directed by microtubules to the nuclear pore, where nuclear import of the hexons results in the release of the viral DNA into the nucleus for its transcription, replication and packaging. Once in the nucleus, E1A, the product of the first viral gene to be expressed, activates the expression of other viral genes required for viral replication and does so, not by binding directly to the promoters of these genes, but by interacting with cellular transcription factors and other regulatory proteins necessary for the transcription of the genes [8]. This capacity of E1A to bind host transcriptional regulators and thus regulate not only viral genes but also genes of the host cell [8] is relevant to its role in the pathogenesis of COPD (see below).",

In transplant patients, vulnerability to adenovirus infection is greatest in the pediatric population, and incidents of infection and severity of disease are both higher in allogeneic versus autologous transplants. The adenovirus source can be a primary infection, reactivation of a persistent or latent infection in the recipient (see above), or possibly, in the case of transplant patients, transmission from the donor. Pneumonitis, which develops from infection mainly by group C adenoviruses (Table 2), has the worst prognosis for survival along with hepatitis and meningoencephalitis. In lung transplant recipients, adenovirus was associated both with respiratory failure, leading to death or graft loss, and with the diagnosis of necrotizing bronchocentric pneumonia or obliterative bronchiolitis. Although most patients eventually clear the virus, treatment for those with adenoviremia, a predictor of a fatal outcome, is limited to antiviral drugs. More recently, less severe outcomes of viremia in adult patients were reported (see Update). Cidofovir, an inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase, and its lipid ester show some promise. Various modes of immunotherapy, including adenovirus-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes, are currently being investigated.",

COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world (The Global Burden of Disease; URL: http://www.who.int/mip/2003/other_documents/en/globalburdenofdisease.pdf), and further increases in its prevalence and mortality are predicted [37]. The major risk factor is the inhalation of toxic particles and gases, primarily from tobacco smoking [32].

Unlike other common childhood respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, the parainfluenza viruses, influenza and coronavirus, which are all RNA viruses, adenovirus has a double-stranded DNA genome. This confers the potential for persistence in the nuclei of infected cells and even the possibility of integrating into the chromosomes of the host cell. This notion is supported by the persistent or latent infections reported above. Furthermore, group C adenoviruses were chosen as a target for study because these serotypes (1, 2, 5 and 6) are largely ubiquitous in children [2, 6]. Besides predominance of this group in upper respiratory tract infections (Table 1), its association with pneumonias in infants (Table 2) is evidence that it also infects the lower respiratory tract.",

A role for adenovirus infections in COPD was further supported by studies in guinea-pigs: after the initial acute infection with adenovirus 5 had subsided and viral replication ceased, E1A DNA and protein continued to be detected in alveolar and airway epithelial cells, and bronchiolitis persisted [42]. Short-term [43] and chronic exposure [44] to cigarette smoke at this time increased the number of inflammatory cells and caused emphysema-like changes, respectively, compared with uninfected animals.",

            "text": "As discussed above, E1A has the capacity to regulate gene transcription of the host cell. To determine whether this is the basis of the relationship between E1A and increased lung inflammation in COPD, both A549 cells (a model of alveolar epithelial cells) and primary bronchiolar epithelial cells expressing adenovirus 5 E1A were developed ([45] and [46], respectively). In both cell-types, the presence of E1A increased ICAM-1 [45, 46] and interleukin (IL)-8 expression [46, 47] in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, but not that of other inflammatory mediators; these increases were accompanied by increased binding activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) [46, 48], which binds to the promoters of the ICAM-1 and IL-8 genes. That E1A affects the promoters of these genes is supported by evidence of increased ICAM-1 promoter-driven reporter gene expression in the presence of E1A [46, 49]. These results suggest that E1A regulates the expression of specific mediators in response to LPS through a common mechanism. Moreover, these mediators promote increases in the number of neutrophils in the lungs of COPD patients (reviewed in [46]), with IL-8 serving as a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, and ICAM-1 as a ligand for the adhesion receptor on neutrophils. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that, of the two NF-\u03baB binding sites in the ICAM-1 promoter, the one most proximal to the transcription start site was essential for increased expression when E1A was present (E Ogawa et al., abstract in Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2003, 167:A401). As a result, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were designed to investigate whether E1A interacts with the proteins of the transcription complex that assembles at this site to promote transcription of the ICAM-1 gene. In both A549 and bronchiolar epithelial cells stimulated with LPS, the presence of E1A increased the binding of NF-\u03baB, the coactivator p300 and RNA polymerase II to this promoter; E1A was also present at this site (K Morimoto et al., abstract in American Thoracic Society International Conference, May 18-23, 2007). Expression of both the ICAM-1 and IL-8 genes was also increased by E1A in response to stimulation with environmental particulate matter < 10 \u03bcm (PM10) and, again, increased gene expression was associated with activation of NF-\u03baB [50, 51]. Taken together, these results suggest that, in lung epithelial cells, adenovirus E1A regulates the expression of mediators relevant to the pathogenesis of COPD by interacting with transcriptional regulators at the promoters of these genes, and that regulation of this response to inflammatory stimuli (i.e. bacteria or environmental pollutants) could play a role in the emphysematous destruction of the lung in COPD.",

These results suggest that E1A can also promote the process of peripheral airway remodeling that occurs in COPD [53]. Studies using guinea-pig cells demonstrated that E1A transforms peripheral lung epithelial cells into cells with a more mesenchymal phenotype [54\u2022], such as myofibroblasts that are active in tissue repair, thereby further supporting a role for E1A in airway remodelling.",

Although the molecular mechanisms that maintain its persistence or latency have not been elucidated, this viral reservoir remains a major source of disease-causing agents in immunosuppressed individuals, for whom promising treatment options with antiviral drugs such as cidofovir and its lipid ester to limit the impact of newly established infections are being developed. Latent infections could also be the source of adenovirus E1A in lungs of COPD patients (Figure 1), although integration of viral DNA needs further investigation. Therapies for latent adenovirus infection in COPD have not yet been developed. Although exacerbations of COPD are treated successfully by glucocorticoids, this therapy does not prevent the continued chronic decline in lung function in this disease. Furthermore, results from a guinea-pig model showed that allergic lung inflammation is steroid resistant in the presence of a latent adenovirus infection [55, 56]. Whether adenovirus confers a similar resistance to inflammation caused by bacterial infections has not been studied; however, unravelling how E1A augments the expression of inflammatory and growth-promoting mediators in lung cells could provide insights into new treatments for COPD.",

These patients were either asymptomatic or had self-limited febrile syndromes despite no change in immunosuppression or specific anti-viral therapy. The authors note that, in contrast to previous findings of adenoviral pneumonitis in lung transplant patients, the isolated episodes of low-level viremia reported here are self-limited and do not trigger acute rejection or a decline in pulmonary function.",
