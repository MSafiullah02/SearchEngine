From the province of Cremona where the first cases were registered, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quickly spread in the Lombardy region, with main epicenters of infections in the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia. The capillary circulation of the infection was rapid and uncontrollable. On March 21 st , exactly one month after the first infection, a total number of 53,578 cases with 4825 deaths had been recorded. To date, April 13 th , in Italy 156.363 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, with 19.899 deaths. 2 To cope with the unstoppable advance of COVID19, the Italian Government approved a series of decrees (the latest issued on April 10 th ) defining standards and rules of quarantine status.",

The need to reorganize the health and emergency network was evident, in order to have an optimal distribution of material and personnel resources. With the issue of Decree XI / 2906, 4 the Lombard Health System emergency network reorganized the existing Hub and Spoke model. The emergency activity was concentrated in four Hub Hospitals (i.e. three Emergency Hub and one Oncological Hub), while Spoke hospitals focused on the management of COVID-19 patients. 5 This system was designed to ensure that the majority of the working force was targeted on COVID-19 patients. Emergencies have been classified into five groups: 1) neurosurgery, 2) stroke, 3) major trauma, 4) interventional cardiology, 5) cardiac surgery and vascular surgery. The neurosurgical and neuroradiological emergencies of a Hub Hospital were classified in: 1) cerebral hemorrhages (subarachnoid and intraparenchymal), 2) acute hydrocephalus, 3) tumors at risk of intracranial hypertension, 4) spinal cord compressions with neurological deficit or at risk of, 5) traumatic cranial and spinal trauma emergencies. The four Hubs can deal with all these emergencies, except for the A+ (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days) and A (with the need of treatment within a month) tumor emergencies that must be centralized to the Oncological Hub. 5 For each group of emergencies, specific Hub and Spoke Hospital All elective Neurosurgery and Neuroradiology activities have been suspended. The operating block has been divided into two areas with separate paths for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. In the non-COVID-19 block Neurosurgery has two dedicated rooms. These rooms include patients whose pathologies of traumatological cranial and/or spine, vascular or determining intracranial hypertension, defined by the Regional The Experience-based model to treasure About a month after the establishment of the new Hub and Spoke system, 4 the first data collected demonstrate the central role assumed by the Hub unit for the management and treatment of neurosurgical and neuroradiological emergencies. The first confirmations on the effectiveness of this reorganized emergency network will have to be reassessed over time when new data becomes available. Di Circolo and Fondazione Macchi Hospital remains, like the other Lombard Hub centers, the beating heart and the gravitational center of emergency management and surgical activity. The reorganization of the emergency network allowed to curb the imminent collapse that the Regional Health System was facing. The COVID-19 outbreak is leaving an indelible scar on our healthcare system. The whole world is facing a common and invisible enemy; a winning weapon can be found in the sharing of resources and experiences between the various centers. May our experience serve as a model for the other regions of the world that will face sudden emergency conditions.",

As for our center, Di Circolo and Fondazione Macchi Hospital in Varese represents one of the Hub Hospitals appointed for the management of neurosurgical and neuroradiological interventional emergencies. The Real life to comprehend Recently, Bertucci et al. 6 published a work regarding the shocking effect of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak on the Department of Neurosurgery of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo. As proposed in Decree XI / 2906, within the new Hub and Spoke system, the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital was supposed to role the reference point for pediatric trauma. In fact, no pediatric traumatic emergencies were sent to this hospital and the structure was progressively filled with COVID-19 patients. Doctors of all specialties, including Neurosurgeons, were reassigned to the new COVID-19 wards. The explosion of COVID-19 in Bergamo and neighboring territories led Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital to fully embody the role of a Spoke hospital, completely disrupting the activity of this hospital. The Front-line to fight Di Circolo and Fondazione Macchi Hospital in Varese represents one of the four Lombard Hub Hospitals. The Spoke hospitals that belong to our Institution are Legnano Hospital and Sant'Anna Como Hospital for neurosurgical emergencies, and Gallarate Hospital for both neurosurgical and stroke emergencies. As a Hub Hospital, Di Circolo and Fondazione Macchi Hospital doubles the number of Neurosurgeons on duties and guarantees 24/7 acceptance of cranial or spinal emergency cases. Neurovascular emergency management was performed in collaboration with the Department of Neurointerventional Radiology, tailoring the treatment (i.e. open surgery and/or endovascular procedure) to the single patient. A pharyngeal swab for COVID-19 research was collected for all patients entering our ward, regardless of the patient clinic and thoracic radiological findings. The Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit became a COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit and the Post Intensive Care Unit became a non-COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit with the need to support vital functions or post-operative monitoring in case of time-dependent emergencies.",

In the COVID-19 block, an operating room has been set up with beds and equipment suitable for emergency neurosurgical operations which do not allow waiting for the outcome of the swabs. The COVID-19 patients or those with a suggestive medical history are treated in these rooms, too. For all personnel involved, 2 nd level personal protective equipment (PPE) is mandatory (cap, protective goggles, FFP2 masks, two pairs of gloves, surgical gown or full suit, overshoes). The dressing and undressing must take place by adhering to the methods provided by the guidelines for the containment of the spread of the infection. The Angiosuite, the MRI Unit, the CT and RX Unit do not allow separate zoning. We use dedicated units (e.g. anesthesia ventilators) when it is possible; the PPE for personnel are chosen according to need. The rooms are properly sanitized after each procedure. At the end of the surgical or radiological procedures, the patients are transferred to the relevant departments, following dedicated intra-hospital lines.The Preliminary data to confrontThe number of cases for each group of neurosurgical and neuroradiological emergencies treated and hospitalized at our center is summarized in the Tables 1A e 1B, comparing the data collected in the first month since the approval of the Hub and Spoke system with those of the previous year. Oncological patients are only limited to A++ tumor emergencies (needing immediate treatment), as cases A+ and A have been sent to the Oncological Hub. Compared to the previous year, there was an increase in both the number of hospitalized and surgically treated cases for all categories of a surgical emergency. It should be emphasized that, despite the restraint measures issued by the Regional Health System, 7 in our Institution there was an increase of 475% and 100% respectively of the hospitalized and surgically treated traumas.These data are in line with the role of Hub Hospital of our Institution, focusing on emergency management and translating the assistance of COVID-19 patients in the satellites Spoke Hospitals. Despite this, COVID-19 patients have also been hospitalized in our center, with progressive growth in their numbers. Already at the time of the issuance of Decree XI / 2906, 8 COVID-19 patients were intubated in intensive care. On April 13 th , the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit was 84.",
