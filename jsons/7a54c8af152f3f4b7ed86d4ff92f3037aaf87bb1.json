We choose the simplest possible model that shows, qualitatively, the behavior that we would like to observe, namely, the effect of temporary immunity. This model can, however, be easily modified to accommodate other compartments, such as an incubation period (exposed state) (as e.g. in [39] ), deaths, asymptomatic cases, etc. For simplicity, we describe the dynamics in discrete time. A continuous time version is analogous and shows the same qualitative behavior. The model is similar to the one studied in [18] , where the focus is on the critical regime. The spreading process changes at discrete time steps, t = {0, 1, 2, . . . }, each time step corresponds to, say, a day. We fix the network G in advance. We think of nodes in the network as individuals. Each node within the network can be in three possible states: susceptible (S), infected (I) or temporarily immune (T). The neighbors of a node u are nodes with a direct connection (also called link, or edge) to u. A connection may correspond to a friendship or an acquaintance, or simply a contact event. The discrete time dynamics between the three states are described as follows (see also Figure 2 ):",

The presence of the network structure, as well as the underlying space, combined with temporary immunity has a surprising effect on the qualitative behavior of the epidemic. More specifically, new phases arise in the phase diagram compared to those in Section 1.2. The duration of the immune period plays a more profound role than in the continuous compartmental model of Section 2.4, where the single supercritical phase is entirely determined by the ratio \u03b2/\u03b3 of the infection rate and the healing rate. For finite spatial network models, there is no well-defined definition of R 0 : the average nodedegree as well as the topology of the network influences the probability of entering each phase. See [18, Figure 1 ] for a phase diagram for Scenario 1. For the S-I-T-S epidemic spread on all three network models (Scenarios 1, 2, and 3) we observe the following three phases, with 2S below being new compared to Scenario 4: 1) Subcritical and critical phase: Immediate extinction. The epidemic goes extinct almost immediately (for all runs), and the number of infected decays exponentially in this case. When R 0 \u2248 1, the epidemic may die out more slowly. We emphasize though, that the critical and subcritical phase do not separate so clearly on the stochastic S-I-T-S model on networks: due to the stochastic nature, the epidemic might die out quickly even when Figure 3 .

With positive probability, there is a large outbreak. For network-based S-I-T-S, the supercritical phase separates into two sub-phases: 2S) Extinction after a Single peak: When the duration of the immune period is long, the epidemic has a single peak, after which it immediately goes extinct. Heuristically, the reason for the existence of this new phase is that after the first epidemic peak, earlier infected nodes become immune and maintain their immunity long-enough to provide barriers in the network that the infection cannot pass through. See Figure  12a . 2M) Long-time survival, Many peaks: When the duration of the immunity period is relatively short, the epidemic follows a (qualitatively) similar curve to the one observed in the ODE in Section 2.4. There is a first major outbreak, followed by smaller second, third, etc., peaks, decreasing in magnitude, and eventually settling on a (meta-stable) stationary proportion of infected and immune population. See Figure  12b . We mention that this equilibrium is a meta-stable state, since the all-susceptible configuration is an absorbing state.

However, the probability of entering a given phase undergoes a sharp transition in the parameter values: for fixed \u03b2, \u03b3, a small change in \u03b7 results in a shift from almost always seeing phase 2S to almost always seeing phase 2M. This is called a sharp threshold phenomenon, see [25, 26] . The sharp threshold is defined as the value of \u03b7 t (N ) where the survival probability crosses 1/2. The same theory suggests that the threshold \u03b7 t (N ) converges in the large network limit.

Under intervention C (limiting node degree) and Intervention B (cutting long-edges), there are no more hubs in the network: nodes with very high degree. Once infected, hubs infect a large proportion of their neighbors roughly at the same time. Moreover, hubs are much closer to each other (in terms of graph distance) than the average distance in the graph, thus the infection can travel quickly between hubs. To summarize, hubs synchronize the system. Once the hubs are removed, this synchronization is also removed from the system and oscillations similar to the grid appear. Limiting node degree without travel restrictions has the strongest effect on the removal of hubs. Limiting travel reduces the degree of hubs, but do not remove them completely, since nodes that were hubs before the intervention, have typically many local connections as well, see Figure 16 .",

In the Chung-Lu and the Norros-Reittu model, only the expected degrees of nodes are prescribed, rather than their exact degree. It is shown that these models, with similar parameter settings, behave qualitatively similarly to the configuration model, see [32] for references. The preferential attachment model is a growing network model, that is best suitable to study the evolution of networks on a longer time-scale. For a relatively short time-frame typical to epidemic spread, a time snapshot of the preferential model could be used. Mathematical results suggest that snapshots of this model behave, again, qualitative similarly to the configuration model with similar degree structure, although numerical values might differ [5, 21, 22, 24] . As a result, we choose the configuration model for baseline comparison.",

Empirically, clustering quantifies the effect commonly known as \"a friend of a friend is also likely to be my friend\". Mathematically, clustering means the presence of triangles in the network. Communities are parts of the network that have significantly more connections than the same number of randomly selected nodes. One could argue that clustering and communities in human contact networks often arise due to spatial effects: people living nearby tend to know each other with higher probability.

The presence of underlying geometry underpins the model: individuals are embedded in space, just like in real life, allowing for local community structures to be present in the contact network, leading to strong clustering [13, 55] . The GIRG incorporates edges bridging spatial distance on all scales, ranging from short to long-range edges, as well as a high variability of node degree: in fact, the model is scale-free in two respects: both in spatial distance that edges cover, and in node-degree variability [13] .",

Such measures result in reducing the number of contact moments between individuals and thus resulting the chance for the virus to spread. When the social distancing measures are not combined with travel restrictions, this results in the underlying contact network to lose its connections randomly. Hence, we model the effect of social distancing by randomly removing a certain proportion of edges in the network. This method is called percolation in the literature [29] .

We see that the configuration model with the smallest \u03c4 has the smallest threshold \u03b7 t , followed closely by GIRG with (\u03c4, \u03b1) = (2.5, 1.3). The grid Z 2 N and long range percolation (LRP) with \u03b1 = 2.3 have the highest \u03b7 t (\u2248 0.085 and \u2248 0.01), these are networks where the average distance is linear.

Before we start with details, a short summary: strong travel restriction is the most effective interventions in terms of reducing the first peak, but it elongates the epidemic enormously and causes later oscillations and often a higher second peak. The effectiveness of increasing \u03b1 depends on the node-degree power-law exponent: when \u03c4 > 3, its effect is comparable to the strong travel restriction, but when \u03c4 \u2208 (2, 3), it is not effective or rather, it does not model travel restrictions well.",

For \u03c4 < 3, increasing \u03b1 is not a good model for the no-travel rule. However, for \u03c4 > 3 (\u03c4 = 3.3 on Figure 16 ), most node-pairs have R u,v < 1 and thus increasing \u03b1 does have a similar effect than cutting long-range edges (compare to middle right picture). Observe that both pictures have the same average degree 2.6, yet the middle left picture on Figure 16 ) looks more sparse: this is because edges are much more localized in space. ii) On the middle left pictures of Figures 17 and Figures 18, the visualization of the first 19 days of the epidemic are shown under the weak no-travel rule: for G 1 (Figures 17) , the remaining edges are mostly long, and thus the picture looks qualitatively similar to the top left, without intervention. However, for G 2 (Figure 18 ), the intervention is very effective, and the epidemic spreads much slower. Within the first 19 days, it only reaches a small fraction of the network localized in various patches. iii On Figure 19 , the long-survival probabilities of epidemics are shown as a function of \u03b7. The weak no-travel rule, increasing \u03b1 (last row in the legend) has its sharp threshold \u03b7 t = 0.003 for G 1 and 0.007 for G 2 , in this respect it is also among the less effective measures for both values of \u03c4 . iv) Table 1 shows the height and location of the first and second peak under the weak no-travel rule (column Bw), while Figures 21, 22 plots these heights as a function of \u03b7. We see again that the location and height of the first peak is insensitive to the change in \u03b7, it is \u2248 50 * 10 3 on day 10 \u00b1 1 for G 1 , while \u2248 33 * 10 3 on day 29 \u00b1 2 on G 2 . We conclude that increasing \u03b1 only model travel restrictions well when \u03c4 > 3. In this case, its effective, the only more effective measure is the strong travel restriction. On G 2 , the height of the first peak is 44% of the original peak, while on G 1 , its 60%.",

Interestingly, this intervention has roughly the same effect as social distancing in terms of reducing the first peak, especially on G 1 , the difference is a few percentages only: On G hub 1 , the height of the first peak is roughly 60% of the original peak, while on G hub 2 , its only 50%. This intervention, unlike social distancing, causes a second peak to appear on G hub 1 , that again increases very slowly with \u03b7 and is roughly 1/5 of the height of the first peak on G hub 1 . The height of second peak on G hub 2 is surprisingly high: roughly a factor 2 higher than that on G 2 . Its height, compared to the first peak on G hub 2 , is also significant: as big as 1/3 of the first peak.",

Bottom: The second peak and stabilization of the number of infected. The average height and location of the first peak is H 1 (G 1 ) = 82785 on day 8 for G 1 , while it is H 1 (G 2 ) = 78263 on day 14 for GIRG with (\u03c4, \u03b1) = (3.3, 1.3). On G 2 , we see a second peak at day 79 of average height H 2 (G 2 ) = 6538, and the equilibrium number of infected E(G 2 ) \u2248 5000 \u00b1 100. The equilibrium number of infected E(G 1 ) \u2248 4700 \u00b1 100 is reached without a second peak on G 1 . .",
