These rapid findings can inform countries of the main issues emerging and help develop effective responses.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first recognized in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. 1 COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease with two main routes of transmission: directly via close contacts with an infected person and indirectly via contact with contaminated surfaces. While evidence gathering continues, concerns are emerging regarding a possible vertical transmission (antenatally or intrapartum). 2, 3 The effect of COVID-19 infection during the 1 st and 2 nd trimester of pregnancy remains to be clarified, highlighting the need for a good surveillance system to register adverse outcomes arising from infection in early pregnancy. At present, the virus has not been detected in breast milk of mothers with confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 infection, so transmission via breastfeeding is then considered unlikely. Direct transmission from mother to child may occur via close contact, but breastfeeding continues to be encouraged with appropriate hygiene measures, including wearing face masks. 4, 5 As of May 4 th 2020, 3.3 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed and more than 230,000 deaths reported globally. 6 Based on data collected by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, an infection with COVID- 19 can cause a range of illness severity: from mild to moderate (>80%), to severe (14%) and critical (5%). The overall case fatality rate is estimated at 2.3%. 7 Among the risk factors associated with an increased case fatality rate are older age, male sex, and comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. 8 Studies are currently ongoing to evaluate whether pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to infection with COVID-19 and if they present a greater risk of severe illness or mortality. However, the available limited evidence suggests that pregnant women have risks of infection comparable to the general population. 9 The disease severity in pregnant women does not appear significantly higher than in nonpregnant women. 10,11 A meta-analysis conducted by Di Mascio et al. of 41 pregnant women hospitalised in a context for a COVID-19 infection showed an increased risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and caesarean section. 12 Symptoms in newborns suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 seem to be mild, with good outcomes. 13 though one study reported a higher risk of perinatal death. 12 Amoroux et al. draw attention to the possible delay in the development of visible hypoxemic lesions in newborns of COVID-19 positive mothers, and advise their close follow-up after birth. 3 However, the limited size of samples in these studies calls for caution and more data need to be collected to draw definitive conclusions. 14 Considering the increased risk of infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza, and the increased mortality linked with H1N1, it is important for pregnant women to be protected from illnesses. 12 However, for pregnant women, irrespective of the risks, symptoms, and severity, the main recommendations to avoid infection remain the same as for the general public. 15, 16 Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, issued stricter measures for pregnant women, categorising them as part of a vulnerable group applying the precautionary principles and recommending self-isolation. 9 The effects of COVID-19 are likely to go beyond the direct provision of care to women and newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Previous infectious disease outbreaks severely reduced the capacity of health systems to provide critical reproductive, maternal, and newborn healthcare, with negative impacts on their health outcomes. [16] [17] [18] Studies of recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EBV), SARS and MERS, highlighted several challenges in countries' preparedness to face outbreaks, amplified by a weak existing systems. This includes lack of protection and safety for healthcare workers leading to disruption in staffing, heightened risk of nosocomial transmission, and elevated stress levels among service providers. 19, 20 A qualitative study by Qian Liu et al. also shows that healthcare providers in China were stressed during the ongoing outbreak because of an added workload and fear of contracting and transmitting the infection. 21 Other indirect consequences of previous infectious disease outbreaks include less healthcare utilisation and limited capacity for public health surveillance. [22] [23] [24] These impacts can persist long after the disease outbreak is contained. 25 However, much of the evidence available about these impacts on maternal and newborn health is either modelled or is from studies using secondary data such as population-based surveys and routine health management information system analysis. 22, 26, 27 Additionally, large disruption to health-seeking behaviour and healthcare provision is caused by the unprecedented measures countries implement to contain the pandemic (e.g., lockdowns, curfews, restrictions on public transport).",

Roberton and colleagues modelled three scenarios projecting a decrease in the coverage of basic life-saving interventions, varying the extent and duration. 28 They estimated an increase in maternal deaths between 12,190 and 56,700, and 253,500-1,157,000 additional deaths of children under five years of age. Similar conclusions have been drawn by Riley et al. who projected that a modest decline in the use of sexual and reproductive healthcare services in 132 low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) will result, over the course of a year, in 48 million additional women with unmet need for modern contraceptives, 15 million additional unwanted pregnancies, and over 3 million additional unsafe abortions will occur. 29 It is therefore critical that the precise nature of the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19, and the adaptations and innovations tested to reduce its impact are captured and described, and that this be done prospectively. 30 Levels of preparedness and response in maternal and newborn care services differ markedly between institutions and countries. Health personnel, including those defined by the World Health Organization as \"competent maternal and newborn health professionals educated, trained and regulated to national and international standards\" 31 are at the frontline of providing care for pregnant women and their newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are expected to be sufficiently competent to: (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications. They are the ones that serve as the interface between the governments working to address the pandemic and pregnant women experiencing the consequences, as such they are uniquely placed to be able to describe the status of care provision during such times.",

This online survey is part of a larger study which seeks to 1) understand how health professionals and health facilities prepare and respond to COVID-19 in regard to the care provided to women and their babies during antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care; and 2) document and analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the services available to pregnant, labouring and postpartum women and their newborns, including as a result of increasing pressures on the healthcare system.",

The questionnaire was prepared in English, and translated into 11 languages (French, Arabic, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, German, Swahili, and Dutch), by native speakers with medical training (minimum two translators per language). It was piloted by asking five maternal/newborn health professionals from different global settings to complete the questionnaire and provide feedback. We used this feedback to assess face validity and refine the wording of the questions and the format and wording of response options. We collected data on the respondents' background (country and region, qualification and work responsibilities, gender, and basic characteristics of the health facility in which the respondents worked, if any). To avoid concerns over confidentiality, we did not collect names of health facilities. The questionnaire included three core modules focusing on preparedness for COVID-19, response to COVID-19, and health workers' own experience of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the fourth, optional module, we asked respondents to elaborate on adaptations to 17 care processes (timing, frequency, modality of contact with patients during various types of outpatient and inpatient care) and to comment on whether they perceived that the uptake of care by the population they serve has changed and, if it had, how. The full questionnaire is provided in Supplementary File 1.",

The lack of COVID-19 symptom screening and the inability to order tests constituted major concerns for respondents, who perceived these deficiencies as threats to the safety of the workforce and of other patients. A midwife from Canada wrote, \"I'm worried about being infected by someone who is asymptomatic, and then being a vector to others.\" Compromising patients' and healthcare providers' safety was also viewed as stemming from deficiencies in availability of PPE, including face masks, gloves, and aprons. These findings were consistent across all settings but more prominent in LMICs ( The majority (81%) of respondents noted that their work had been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and that their stress levels were either somewhat or substantially higher than usual (90%, .\" A major challenge reported was the decrease in skill mix and shortages of qualified staff, either because of symptoms, self-isolation after potential exposure, or not being able to get to their workplace due to lockdowns and transport restrictions as described by a midwife in Uganda: \"[t]ransport to work is a big challenge due to lockdown; many staff live far away from the hospital.

Figure 1 shows the main reported changes in service provision and utilisation, care content and quality, and care process adaptations across the continuum of maternal and newborn care. In all settings and across the continuum of care, participants reported seeing fewer patients at healthcare facilities. This was described as the result of transportation difficulties in accessing health facilities or due to women's fear of contracting COVID-19 at the facility. A nurse-midwife from Kenya wrote, \"[a]ccessing inpatient antenatal care [is] minimal. Women fear to [get] infected with COVID-19 if [they are present] in hospitals. Most of them keep off from hospital even when they are sick\". Most respondents noted that their facilities have shortened visiting hours and reduced the number of visitors allowed, while others are screening visitors for symptoms, or have banned visits altogether. Importantly for the support of women during labour and childbirth, facilities are reportedly limiting the number of labour companions to one person designated as the single visitor allowed to stay with the mother after birth or banning birth companions altogether. This raised concerns among healthcare providers regarding the reduced support available to women, and increased workload on the staff. An obstetrician from the Czech Republic remarked that: \"[the] Gynaecological and Obstetrical Society has recommended to ban partners and doulas from accompanying a woman at birth -outrageous!!!\" Some healthcare facilities were implementing social/physical distancing measures in the waiting areas of the outpatient departments, and in hospital rooms by reducing the number of beds. Yet, this recommendation is challenging to meet in facilities where resources are limited -an obstetrician/gynaecologist from India noted that \"[it is] not practically possible [to place each patient in a separate birthing room] in our set up\". Non-essential services including elective gynaecological procedures and infertility treatments were being postponed or cancelled. In several settings, responding to the COVID-19 outbreak affected the delivery of routine ANC, which became restricted to the management of high-risk patients. A respondent from New York reported a \"significant decrease in number of ANC visits\", whereby new policies recommend the reduction of the number of face-to-face visits during pregnancy \"from 10-12 to four\". Other changes include eliminating the waiting area, spacing face-to-face appointments to reduce contact between patients, and cancelling all group activities such as health education sessions or group counselling.",

Although telemedicine was considered a priority in certain LMICs where it is not implemented yet, participants acknowledged the challenges associated with this service provision modality. This includes lack of access to adequate communication infrastructure among women. Respondents from both LMICs and HICs noted that the demand for home births has increased and that new practices aimed to reduce induction of labour. In certain HICs, induction of labour was reported to be discouraged before 41 weeks of gestation. Changes in pain relief options for labouring women in HICs included decrease in the use of nitrous oxide to reduce the risk of infection transmission through aerosols, and suspended waterbirths. Across all settings, caesarean sections were reported as a commonly performed procedure among women who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Some respondents noted that their facilities have dedicated operating theatres specifically for this purpose. On the other hand, the numbers of elective caesarean sections have reportedly decreased among \"healthy\" maternity patients. However, this was not consistent in facilities where certain efforts were made to reduce the duration of labour and the time spent in the labour room by augmentation. As a result, respondents speculated about a potential rise in caesarean section rates in their facilities, as noted by an obstetrician/gynaecologist from India: \"We will not allow as much time in second stage [of labour], [\u2026] this is likely to push up our caesarean rate.\" .

This was worrisome for some respondents as noted by a midwife from the UK: \"[the] lack of time and staff will lead to mothers and babies going home with very little feeding support or knowledge which will have a short and long term impact on their health and ability to deal with infections.\" Routine postnatal checks are being postponed in certain cases or substituted with telemedicine. A nurse-midwife from the United States reported that \"[w]e are postponing the routine postpartum visit until 12 weeks postpartum, and are prescribing most contraceptives over the phone or [\u2026] and breastfeeding support is all done virtually.\" Changes to newborn postnatal care were infrequently reported, and mainly included monitoring and isolation of babies of mothers with confirmed COVID-19. Three respondents from India noted that the infant vaccination schedule was disrupted or postponed. Overall, respondents expressed their concern over the uncertain impact of reduced face-to-face interactions on the quality of care. A midwife from the UK wrote: \"[w]hilst I completely see the need to restrict our face-to-face care to protect staff and patients, my heart just breaks for women and families who we won't be able to offer the full range of midwifery support to... i.e. BF support, daily visits, and just generally our time\". Maternal and newborn health professionals feared that the changes to the standards of care would lead to poor health outcomes among women and newborns and, subsequently to the loss of progress achieved in certain indicators (e.g., stillbirth rates). \"I am also worried about the implications of the policies that call for separating newborns from COVID-19 positive mothers immediately after birth, without allowing for skin-to-skin or delayed cord clamping,\" wrote a nurse-midwife from the United States.",

These discrepancies could stem from the differential progression of the outbreak (whereby more respondents from HICs reported having provided care to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected maternity cases than those from LMICs). These differences could also be partly attributed to the limited capacities and resources of healthcare systems in some LMICs. 48 There is speculation that the outbreak in African countries might be attenuated, but equally possible that trends similar to those witnessed in Europe might be observed. 49, 50 This indicates an urgent need to mobilise resources in resource-limited settings, improve testing capacities, and upgrade the responses, including at maternity facilities. The total absence of testing for suspected patients in refugee and/or displaced persons camps reported by all respondents with such experience raises concerns.

Consistently with experiences from previous infectious disease outbreaks and emergencies, healthcare workers providing essential services to women and newborns during this pandemic experience increased levels of stress and anxiety. 20, 44 Stress levels in LMICs were comparable to those in HICs even though countries were battling different stages of the outbreak. This might be due to uniformly reported changes in working hours, inability to reach health facilities, and shortages in skilled workforce (some of which were attributable to lockdowns and other blanket measures to combat the spread of COVID-19) leading to higher workloads, which can lead to staff burnout. 48, 58 Wilson et al. compiled a list of measures that could prevent burnout among maternity care providers. 44 Other lessons learned from past epidemics include the provision of emotional, social and mental health support to care providers, and ensuring that adequate levels of support is available to them from facility management. 20,59 As our findings show, this can create additional burdens to management and special efforts should be placed to provide support to this group. 44 With the increasing reliance on students and trainees to compensate for staff shortage, Wilson et al. consider this group to be more exposed to stressors considering their lack of experience, and therefore senior colleagues should actively advocate for their wellbeing. 44 Future research should explore the availability of mental and social support to maternal and newborn healthcare providers during the pandemic, and its effectiveness. 60 Another cause for increased stress levels among providers is the fear for their own/their relatives' safety, in addition to the safety of their patients, which is intensified by inadequate access to PPE. One reason for that is that in some facilities, PPE supplies are prioritised for departments treating COVID-19 cases and not reaching maternity wards, which is common in vulnerable settings. Workers who provide essential maternity care and their patients, could thus experience uneven risks of nosocomial infection during outbreaks. 61, 62 In some countries, obstetricians/gynaecologists commonly work in multiple facilities across the public and private sectors, and their risk of exposure might be exacerbated by the higher number of contacts (other healthcare workers and patients) they experience in this dual practice. 63 Although PPE items are essential, the WHO issued guidelines that promote their rational use given universal shortage. 64 The application of these guidelines must be unified within healthcare facilities, and clearly communicated to maternity and newborn healthcare providers and explained to patients. 44 Health workers caring for women around the time of birth might be used to wearing PPE, however it can make them feel dehumanized, and the donning and doffing PPE is time-consuming and might delay the provision of emergency services. 20, 21 Healthcare providers also worry about the consequences of rapidly changing practices and the uncertainty of their impact on health outcomes. The perceived changes in healthcare seeking behaviours include fewer visits to the healthcare facilities, shortened lengths-of-stay after childbirth, less access to adequate ANC, and in certain cases, disrupted immunisation schedules. Our findings support the narratives told by healthcare providers regarding the discontinuity of basic services, 65 and align with disruptions witnessed during previous infectious disease outbreaks. 58,66-68 These disruptions have previously led to an increase in maternal and neonatal mortality, 22, 69 and currently there are signs of similar trends reported from two maternity hospitals in Uganda. 70 Our knowledge of the impact of these changes is restricted to predictions resulting from modelling which strongly suggest a threat to achieved improvements in LMICs. 28, 29 The actual impact is yet to be quantified 28 and the effect of these changes in HICs remains unclear. Prioritised measures depending on contextual needs must be put in place to mitigate these indirect consequences of the pandemic. 28, 30 Although some of the changes to care content and process are consistent with the updated guidelines on essential care provision, 40,71-73 other modifications diverge from available evidence, and could ultimately reverse achieved progress if proper action is not taken. These include the elimination of birth companions altogether, 73,74 reducing or banning visitors to maternity wards, performing caesarean section on all COVID-19 positive women, 74, 75 augmenting labour or performing unindicated caesarean sections to gain control over timing of deliveries, separating newborns from COVID-19 positive mothers including not allowing breastfeeding, 76 and drastically reducing length-of-stay after facility birth with fewer home visit follow-ups. 47 .

Another alarming adaptation to COVID-19 is freezing or postponing routine immunisation schedules. 78 Temporary disruptions to routine immunisation were only reported in India in our survey, however other LMICs have implemented similar measures. 78 This can result in overall declines in population coverage, and catch-up campaigns should be prioritised following the relaxation of preventive measures to ensure the sustainability of achievements. 78, 79 The introduction of new models of care such as telehealth guidance 29,71 was described as a 'virtually perfect solution' to ensure sustained care provision during the pandemic. 80 Yet this model's feasibility is not universal to all healthcare services. Midwives dread this mode's disturbance of the quality of provided care, 47 and providers in LMICs consider this as an added barrier to achieving equitable access to essential services for women and families who lack the needed resources.",

Dynamics of mutual incomprehension between patients and providers about the attitudes toward and measures necessitated by the outbreak may be taken into account regarding the impact of COVID-19 on maternal and newborn healthcare; especially (but not only) concerning regions and countries where there is a strong medical and cultural pluralism towards the healthcare seeking behaviours. Although only a few respondents mentioned some resistance of patients and local communities to increased hygiene and physical distancing measures in facilities, we know from previous outbreaks such as Ebola that understanding social and cultural responses to the epidemics is essential to prevent healthcare disasters. 86 Furthermore, many respondents addressed the reduction of the number of visitors allowed during labor and childbirth, when such measures do not seem justified. Limiting social support during maternal and neonatal care can put mother and newborn at risk, more particularly in healthcare facilities with an ordinarily high lack of staff and irregular drug delivery where families and surrounding play a crucial role in limiting the impact of these shortcomings. 82,87 A local understanding of healthcare seeking behaviors and social maternal health organization must take place to avoid a top-down management of the outbreak guidelines that may miss the mark of these local pre-existing factors. 88",

Our sample might over-represent higher qualified cadres of health professionals in settings with limited use of technology among lower cadres of staff, and under-represent staff who are most overstretched in providing healthcare, or those with limited or no access to internet connection, as we received few responses from professionals working in lower-level facilities, particularly in LMICs. The representativeness of the sample is affected by the availability of the survey in three languages (English, French, and Arabic) for a longer time than the remaining nine languages. Additionally, some cadres, such as neonatologists and paediatricians, were less represented. The questionnaire asks about facilities where respondents work, which is not relevant to independently practicing professionals, especially midwives; this might have discouraged some of them from completing the survey. Finally, data were collected across countries that were going through different stages of the outbreak. As previously mentioned, this could account for country-level discrepancies in the response, and some of the differences seen between HIC and LMIC respondents. We intend to address some of these limitations in survey rounds.",

Responding to this crisis is proving to be challenging for health systems and providers, and affects access to basic health services across the globe. Preparedness for the global pandemic might have been equally inadequate for health systems in LMICs and HICs in some aspects, such as shortage in skilled staff, providing training and simulations, and PPE sufficiency. However, it is likely that HICs were able to respond more effectively, due to better health system resilience such as existing coordination systems to develop and implement changes to protocols. 89 Findings from this study will be useful in supporting the development of effective responses to the main issues identified, both during the COVID-19 pandemic and more broadly during future health system shocks.",
