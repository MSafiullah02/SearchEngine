Under certain circumstances, these infectious \u2018mimickers\u2019 can activate the immune system, initiate an immune response and lead to a breakdown in self-tolerance and autoimmunity.8 Structural homology \u2013 meaning that a single antibody or T-cell receptor can only be activated by a few residues \u2013 is crucial for this immune system activation. Following the encounter with the pathogen, activated autoreactive B or T cells can cross-react with self-epitopes, thus leading to autoimmunity.9 Autoimmunity is the result of a loss of immunological tolerance, the ability of the immunologic system to discriminate between self and nonself. Recent data show that autoimmune diseases affect approximately 1 in 31 people within the general population.10 Growth also has led to a greater characterisation of what autoimmunity is and how it can be studied and treated. With the increased amount of research, there has been tremendous growth in the study of several different ways in which autoimmunity can occur, one of which is molecular mimicry. Thus, nowadays the term molecular mimicry has been transformed and is used to define an autoimmune response elicited by a microorganism\u2019s antigenic determinants.11\n",

Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) has regions bearing homology to SLE-associated antigens such as ribonucleoprotein Smith antigen (Sm) and Ro self-protein.8,\n16, 17, 18 By tracing autoantibody response in SLE back in time, cross-reactivity was found between the Ro self-protein, the initial SLE autoantigen and EBNA-1, suggesting it is triggered by molecular mimicry.19 Furthermore, in mice, expression of EBNA-1 may elicit antibodies to Sm and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and antibodies elicited in response to EBNA-1 were shown to cross-react with dsDNA.20,\n21 Finally, in rabbits, immunization with EBNA-1 fragments containing the PPPGRRP sequence led to the development of antibodies with cross-reactivity to Sm and nuclear ribonucleoproteins; after immunization, most of the rabbits developed leucopenia or lymphopenia (or both), the features of which resemble those of SLE.22\n",

He specified the antiphospholipid antibodies and further compared sera from those three groups with sera from patients with SLE trying to investigate the dependence of anticardiolipin binding on the presence of \u03b22-glycoprotein I as a cofactor. Sera from patients with PB19 was found to have different antiphospholipid specificity when compared with sera from patients with other infections; like sera from patients with SLE trying but unlike sera from patients with other acute viral infections or syphilis, anticardiolipin antibodies of patients with PB19 were found to increase their binding ability in the presence of \u03b22-glycoprotein I.32 After synthesizing a PB19 viral peptide, Lunardi et al.33 demonstrated that purified anti-PB19 antibodies cross-reacted with autoantigens such as keratin, collagen type II, ssDNA and cardiolipin. Afterwards, 8 mice were immunised with that same viral peptide, eliciting autoantibody production against keratin, collagen II, cardiolipin and ssDNA in 6 of them.33\n",

Those studies led to the suggested criteria for \u2018diagnosing\u2019 the role of molecular mimicry in autoimmune diseases.50 The first requirement is that the suspected pathogen must be associated with the presence, onset or exacerbation of the autoimmune disease in a convincing number of patients. Second, the infectious agent must provoke either a T-cell-dependent or T-cell-independent immune response (i.e., autoantibodies) that cross-reacts with host antigens and is clinically relevant to the autoimmune disease. The proof of the causality between the mimic epitope and the autoimmune disease can be achieved by active immunization with the shared epitope in animal models and induction of the autoimmune disease or by passive transfer of the disease using autoreactive T cells or autoantibodies.",

Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination seems to be the most common method of avoiding autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the epitopes shared between the pathogen and the host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry.107 Unfortunately, this method is not straightforward. Recently, a large number of published case reports of immunologic late reactions to vaccines raised the hypothesis that specific vaccines containing adjuvants are responsible for autoimmune diseases, especially in genetically susceptible patients. The entity autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants describes the role of various environmental factors in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. Of these factors, those entailing immune adjuvant activity, such as infectious agents, silicone, aluminium salts and others, were associated with defined and nondefined immune-mediated diseases both in animal models and in humans.108\n",
