            "text": "Despite the high percentage of patients who suffer from ototoxic and/or nephrotoxic side effects following treatment with AGs, the well-established efficacy of these antibiotics, especially against reoccurring Gram-negative infections, makes them an irreplaceable component of the current World Health Organization's arsenal of antibiotics. Although AG-induced toxicity has been poorly addressed by drug designers, in recent years several groups have made progress toward deciphering how AGs influence various processes in eukaryotic cells with the goal of drawing structure\u2013toxicity relationship guidelines that will facilitate the development of safer AG antibiotics. It is well established that the extent of perturbation of the two eukaryotic translation machineries, the ribosomes in the cytosol and those in the mitochondria, correlates well with the toxicity of AGs. Therefore, in vitro translation assays using bacterial or mammalian ribosomes and hybrid bacterial ribosomes containing the A-sites of either the mammalian cytosolic or mitochondrial ribosomes are useful tools to predict the extent of toxicity of most AG derivatives. However, due to the tremendous structural diversity among different members of the AG class of antibiotics, it is not surprising that we and others have provided experimental evidence for additional effects of AGs such as membrane permeabilization and stress response-mediated effects. These effects likely result from the interactions of AGs with targets other than the translation machineries, and their weight in the overall toxicity of the antibiotic depends on the specific AG and on the test model. Fortunately, chemical modification strategies can be applied to moderate the non-ribosomal effects as well.",

The fact that AG administration through inhalation, used for treatment of respiratory bacterial infections, reduces significantly their toxic side-effects, supports this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Ideally, AGs should be resistant to enzyme-mediated deactivation and not toxic to mammalian cells. The recent example of plazomicin, the semisynthetic sisomicin derivative that gained FDA approval in 2018, provides hope that AGs can be modified to both block resistance mechanisms and to moderate toxicity. This AG is not deactivated by most known AG-modifying enzymes and has not shown significant toxic side effects in animal models. While this AG did induce nephrotoxic effects in humans, it caused no significant ototoxic side effects during clinical trials. Moreover, recent examples reported by our group and by Crich and co-workers clearly demonstrate that chemical modifications can be harnessed to significantly improve the selectivity of AGs for the bacterial translation machinery and to reduce off-ribosomal toxicities without a significant loss of antibacterial activity.",

Hopefully, the current state will change before an international health crisis draws humanity one more step back to the pre-antibiotic era. The current lack of effective drugs for treatment of the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an example for the terrible effects that infectious diseases can inflict on human health and on global economy. In the meantime, it is imperative that researchers continue to study the mechanisms of toxicities caused by AGs and structure\u2013toxicity and structure-resistance relationships to pave the way for development of AGs with improved toxicity profiles and high efficacy against resistant bacteria.",
