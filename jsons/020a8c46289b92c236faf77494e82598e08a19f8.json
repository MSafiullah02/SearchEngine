Many cardiovascular and hepatobiliary procedures result in massive hemorrhage and postpartum hemorrhage events in labor and delivery place the patient at a high risk for mortality. Both upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., diverticulosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and peptic ulcer disease) can also result in signifi cant blood loss requiring massive transfusion and resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. Therefore, safe, timely, and effective transfusion of blood products is critical. The aim of this chapter is to provide clinicians with a discussion of the current literature on the various blood component products, their indications, and unique hemostatic conditions in the surgical patient. While the majority of data concerning optimal management of acquired coagulopathy and hemorrhagic shock resuscitation is based on trauma patients, many of the principles can and should be applied to the surgical patient (or likely any patient) with profound hemorrhage.",

Another diffi culty is that once it has been determined that the patient should receive plasma, an additional 30-45 min is required to thaw and deliver the products [ 5 ] . As such , hospitals should have in place a thawed plasma program, keeping adequate numbers of \"universal\" and type-specifi c thawed plasma available for immediate release. Plasma thawing protocols exist to avoid this issue and will be discussed in later sections. In acutely bleeding patients, massive transfusion protocols should be activated in order to effi caciously restore blood volume and hemostasis and thawed plasma is critical to their success [ 5 , 10 ] .

Plasma should be available in either thawed form (5 day shelf-life once thawed) or liquid form (never frozen, absolute shelf-life of 21-26 days) . A type and screen should be drawn as soon as possible to allow for the transition from universal products to type-specifi c ones. The effi cacy of an MTP also lies in its early implementation as well as identifi cation of patients who would benefi t from such an intervention. Criteria for activation include laboratory values, anatomic injuries, and mechanism of injury. Although individual laboratory values (hemoglobin, INR, hematocrit, and pH) have been shown to correlate with massive transfusion requirements, MTP activation should never be delayed on the basis of lab results, which can take up to 45 min to return. The urgency in treating severely injured patients requires early and immediate initiation of MTP based on clinical assessment for rapid delivery of blood products to the bedside. Several scoring systems have been developed to facilitate rapid identifi cation of patients requiring MTP activation based on physical and laboratory results (Table 13.1 ) . Several authors have demonstrated that the transfusion of uncross-matched RBCs is an independent predictor of substantial hemorrhage and the transfusion of multiple units of RBC, plasma, and platelets [ 12 , 13 ] . As such, when one is requesting uncross-matched product for transfusion, the institution's MTP should be activated.",

            "text": "Prior to the advent of MTPs, resuscitation protocols for severely injured patients began with large volumes of crystalloid followed by RBC transfusions . Later on, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate were administered if the patient had survived the operating theater and then only based on laboratory values and the opinion of anesthesiologists and transfusion specialists. These guidelines recommended transfusions at prothrombin time ratio of >1.5, platelet counts of <50 \u00d7 10 9 /L, fi brinogen level <1.5-2.0 g/L or after a predetermined volume loss. This approach relied on a reactive strategy where the clinician was constantly \"catching up\" with values representing an earlier hemodynamic state of the patient [ 14 ] . While this standard resuscitation method is adequate for patients who are not in shock or not bleeding, studies have demonstrated that it does not suffi ce for the subset of patients who have sustained serious injuries, are coagulopathic or in shock [ 5 ] . One reason is that the coagulopathy is addressed after a time lapse since the original laboratory values were obtained. Other reasons for the suboptimal results of this method are due to the ratios of each blood component product infused. Specifi cally, evidence exists that demonstrates that large volume of crystalloid fl uids is associated with increased hemorrhage and lower survival rates [ 15 ] . It has been hypothesized that this effect is due to insuffi cient replenishing of hemostasis factors, and the complex coagulopathy of dilution, consumption of factors, and fi brinolysis is not adequately addressed. MTPs also offer the advantage of reducing intraoperative crystalloid use and hence, reducing opportunities for hemodilution.",

The Cardiovascular Health Study found that anemia is associated with increased mortality in elderly patients, emphasizing the importance of treatment [ 22 ] . However, correction of anemia in the nonbleeding surgical patient has not been well studied, and its benefi ts remain controversial. While most would agree that actively bleeding patients should be maintained at a hemoglobin between 8 and 10 g/ dL, agreement is lacking as to what degree of anemia exceeds benefi t:harm ratio in the non-bleeding population ( Fig. 13.2 ). The majority of literature currently supports more conservative trigger points in the non-bleeding population, between 7 and 8 g/dL. Englesbe and colleagues reviewed the literature in surgical patients and found that survival was not improved when postoperative patients were transfused to correct a hematocrit of 25 % [ 23 ] . The authors recommended making the decision to transfuse using a host of physiological measures and evaluation of the patient's compensatory ability, not only the hemoglobin or hematocrit. They have used a hematocrit of 16 % for initiating transfusion in cases where the patient has excellent compensatory ability, and 21 % when they lacked such capabilities. The [ 24 ] . Among critically ill patients, high quality evidence supports conservative triggers for RBC transfusion in critically ill patients [ 25 ] . A multicenter randomized, controlled, clinical trial of 838 critically ill patients compared the outcomes of patients who were transfused at hemoglobin levels of less than 7.0 g/dL and those who were transfused at hemoglobin levels below 10.0 g/dL [ 25 ] . Their study ultimately found that the more restrictive trigger of 7.0 g/dL was superior to the liberal one and patients experienced improved 30-day survival rates. Of note, of the various patient populations studied, this improvement was not found to be signifi cant in patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Based on this, many would argue that in patients with acute cardiac events, data does not robustly support either strategy over the other.",

The advantage of whole blood is its ability to increase hemoglobin levels, similarly to red blood cells, and its ability to restore blood volumes, similarly to crystalloids [ 47 ] .

The most common cause of hemolytic reactions due to transfusion of an incorrect match is clerical error. Hemolytic reactions in blood transfusions occur because each individual carries antibodies against the blood group (A or B) that it does not express endogenously. Hence, when products containing anti-A or anti-B antibodies in plasma, such as plasma, are transfused to patients of A, B or both blood groups, the donor antibodies stage an attack on the patient's red blood cells. Allergic reactions are another common immune-mediated complication of transfusions. Severely anaphylactic reactions are more common after plasma compared to RBC transfusion [ 32 ] .

TRALI is the most common cause of death due to transfusion [ 32 ] . TRALI is characterized by respiratory insuffi ciency, not limited to but including tachypnea, cyanosis, dyspnea, and acute hypoxemia [ 50 ] . In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, TRALI is further exacerbated by the presence of end-stage liver disease. Proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon have included antibody-mediated reactions, but these fi ndings are not defi nitive and many are subject to selection bias due to no screening in the asymptomatic population [ 50 ] . Autopsies and animal models have suggested hyperactive PMN involvement, since mass infi ltration was noted [ 50 ] . A two-event model has also been proposed, with the fi rst event dictated by the clinical health of the patient and the second event by the quality (affected by storage, donor immunologic components) of the blood product [ 50 ] . The treatment of TRALI is aggressive respiratory support and ventilation in more severe cases, such as in critically ill patients [ 50 ] . Practices to reduce the risk of TRALI include prestorage leukoreduction as well as avoiding the use of old blood products, defi ned as older than 14 days for RBCs and older than 2 days for platelet concentrates. Another prevention strategy is using only male donors or donors who have never been pregnant due to look back studies showing fewer TRALI events in blood donations from those populations [ 51 ] . Eder et al. demonstrated that preferential distribution of plasma from male donors reduced the reported number of TRALI cases. However lethal these rare events are, it is critical to understand the risk-benefi t ratio in such cases. As noted earlier, current rates of TRALI are estimated at just over 4 cases per 1,000,000 units transfused [ 52 ] .",

The exact mechanism of this effect has not yet been elucidated, but plasma components, WBCs, metabolic products from storage processes are thought to play a role. This effect may be responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of transfusions on severely ill patients. Transfusions can cause sensitization to HLA antigens, creating a unique problem in potential kidney transplant patients. Studies have demonstrated increased sensitization of patients on a kidney transplant waiting list after transfusion, rendering them unsuitable candidates for living donation. Their only remaining alternative once this has occurred is to wait for a cadaveric graft, which takes up to 4 times longer, and may never receive a transplant. Hence, non-life-sustaining transfusions should be avoided in potential kidney transplant recipients [ 23 ] .",

The most stringent testing protocols and sensitive tests may not ever eradicate the risk of infectious agent transmission as new pathogens of unknown methods of spread are constantly emerging and may not actively be screened for in its early emergence. In addition, long incubation period of pathogens before seroconversion of blood make it even harder to prevent [ 27 ] . Prion diseases transmitted by transfusion has been a concern in the UK, following the BSE epidemic. Unfortunately, no screening test for this condition has been established, and the occurrence of prion diseases in blood products in the UK is largely unknown.

            "text": "Another concerning complication is the loss of effi cacy in stored blood, and the adverse effects it causes. These consequences of the storage process are known as a storage lesion. With current technology, the shelf life of red blood cells cannot be extended further than its physiological shelf life of 120 days, and 35 and 42 days is the limit of viability in whole blood and adenine-saline preservation, respectively [ 27 ] . Even this length of shelf-life results in counterproductive transfusions. Specifi cally, RBC products older than 2 weeks have been shown to not improve oxygen uptake in septic patients. In fact, RBCs of that age have been associated with higher mortality, increased adverse events, extended hospital stay, and electrolyte imbalances. This reduction in effi cacy may be due to decreased ability of the older RBCs to unload oxygen [ 27 ] . Another proposed mechanism is that since stored RBCs have depleted nitric oxide, this may have a vasoconstrictive effect, leading to thrombosis and the observed increases in venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with increased RBC and platelet transfusions [ 49 ] . The question is how realistic it is to maintain strict storage age in a fi nite and scarce resource such as blood. A doubleblind, prospective randomized pilot study demonstrated that controlling the storage age of RBCs in transfusion compared to the current standard of care is feasible and results in decreased exposure to older blood [ 55 ] . More evidence is needed to determine precisely the cut-off age of RBCs in their effi cacy and availability. In stored platelets, it has been estimated that the recovery rate of 5-day-old platelets is about 50 %, with many nonviable platelets being sequestered into the spleen [ 38 ] . For these reasons, there is some concern that platelet counts performed immediately after transfusion do not provide an accurate picture of platelet function [ 38 ] .",

Furthermore, CCTs , which are riddled with delays from time to arrival in the laboratory and duration of testing, end up refl ecting the coagulation state of the patient after 30-45 min of interventions and resuscitation [ 63 ] .

The G -value represents overall clot strength, including platelet function as well as enzymatic, and is decreased in hypocoagulable states (normal 5.3-12 K dynes/ cm 2 ).

Solomon et al. demonstrated that fi brinogen clot elasticity assessed by TEG correlated to fi brinogen concentration in cardiopulmonary bypass patients [ 67 ] .

Unlike other surgeries, liver surgery poses the additional problem of increased risk of coagulation factor defi ciencies due to hepatic dysfunction and lack of synthesis. TEG-guided transfusion algorithms in this area have been shown to reduce the transfusion requirements in such patients [ 17 ] . However, Ogawa et al.'s prospective observational study of 26 patients undergoing cardiac surgery did not fi nd a signifi cant correlation between TEG measures and volume of intraoperative and total transfusions [ 66 ] . Despite these fi ndings, Ronald et al.'s literature search and appraisal of 170 studies on the topic found otherwise [ 68 ] . They investigated thromboelastography in cardiac surgery patients and found fourteen studies that provided the best evidence. Their synthesis concluded that TEG can guide transfusion therapy algorithms and result in decreased blood component requirements. In orthopedic surgery patients, TEG was used in a prospective study to identify disturbed fi brin polymerization as a pathological mechanism in dilutional coagulopathy, and to rescue this state with fi brinogen administration [ 69 ] .",

Various mechanisms affect coagulation cascades in these patients, and techniques from the standard coagulation tests to TEG are currently available. These have shown mostly success in predicting the course of the patient and guiding therapy. The therapeutic options include various blood product components, ranging from whole blood to concentrations of individual factors. Using physiological ratios of RBCs, plasma, and platelets have improved patient survival in the massively hemorrhaging patient. However, like all powerful therapy, they are associated with adverse effects. Preventative options such as decreasing storage lengths and screening for infectious agents have drastically reduced these risks. Lastly, administering these products in a rapid and directed fashion would not be feasible without in-house triage and massive transfusion protocols. These algorithms include steps that must be taken to smooth out logistics of urgent transfusions, such as anticipating adequate thawing times of fresh frozen plasma and collaborating with blood banks to crosscheck appropriateness of each order.
