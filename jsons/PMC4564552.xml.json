While a past study documents in immunocompromised NHPs the safety of recombinant, live-attenuated VSV [28], concerns still persisted with its use for mass immunization in humans. However, the 2014 EBOV outbreak in West Africa has accelerated VSV-vectored vaccines toward clinical development, and VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP is 1 of 2 candidates under consideration to be used in a clinical setting to combat current and future outbreaks [29]. Furthermore, a broad-spectrum VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP can also be applied to vaccinations in susceptible animal populations, such as NHPs for both H5N1 and EBOV. This study aims to highlight the versatility of VSV vectors as viable multivalent vaccines with the ability to confer protection against multiple unrelated and highly virulent pathogens.",

Cross-protection against 3 other heterologous H5N1 viruses was observed when exposure occurred at 28 days after vaccination, but was not observed when the vaccine was given at 30 minutes postexposure. Interestingly, broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies were not detected postvaccination, which implies the mechanism for cross-protection against H5N1 influenza may be based on other antibody mechanisms, or cellular immunity. The results show, for the first time, rapid postexposure protection against a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus with pandemic potential as well as a simultaneous challenge with 2 unrelated pathogens.",

The role of humoral immunity against HA in protection against influenza has been clearly established, in which postimmunization HI antibody titers of greater than 1:40 considered protective in at least 50% of individuals [33].

However, in this study, an increased dose of 1 \u00d7 107 PFU VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP did not result in complete protection (Table 2). This suggests that there may be competition between the HA and ZGP antigens, or that the VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP vaccine may be attenuated due to the addition of 2 distinct antigens into the genome. Because the VSV genome would be elongated with the addition of 2 antigens instead of 1, the replication kinetics of VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP may be slower than that of VSV\u0394G-ZGP, thus impairing the ability of the bivalent vaccine to mount a quick and robust immune response leading to postexposure protection. Another possible explanation may be that the placement of the ZGP gene downstream of HA in the VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP genome resulted in lowered expression levels of ZGP compared to that of VSV\u0394G-ZGP, as was shown previously for the genes in the wild-type VSV genome [34]. However, with the development of promising antibody-based therapeutics against EBOV [35, 36, 37] and the availability of anti-influenza drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, VSV-vectored vaccines are expected to play a bigger role as a prophylactic candidate rather than as a therapeutic. Future experiments should include the testing of the bivalent VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP vaccine in higher animal models to confirm the observed protective effects, such as against EBOV in NHPs, and against both homologous and heterologous H5N1 strains in ferrets. While VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP was well tolerated in mice, there is a need to fully elucidate the safety profile of this bivalent vaccine in order to facilitate clinical acceptance.",
