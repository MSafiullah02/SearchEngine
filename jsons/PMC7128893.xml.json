            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae which are large, enveloped, positive-stranded Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses within the order Nidovirals.1 FCoVs are separated into two different types based upon their growth ability in vitro, antigenic relationship with canine coronavirus (CCV), neutralisation reactivity with S protein-specific antibody and homology of the S protein gene.2, 3, 4, 5, 6 FCoVs show a bimodal pathogenicity distribution, with subclinical or mild enteric infections in young kittens at one extreme and the deadly feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) at the other. The low virulence strains are referred to as feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV) and the highly virulent ones as FIP viruses (FIPV).7, 8 Molecular studies have suggested that mutations in the FECV genome induce the virulent FIPV variants in infected cats.7, 9, 10, 11 Infection with FCoV is prevalent in pet cats. The virus is endemic especially in environments where many cats are kept together in a small space (eg, catteries, shelters, pet stores). Antibodies against FCoVs are found in 20\u201360% of pet cats and up to 90% of animals living in catteries or multi-cat households.12, 13 FCoVs are highly infectious and spread predominantly by the faeco-oral route, although the virus is also spread via oro-nasal secretions and in urine.14 Cats recovering from coronavirus infection will shed virus in their faeces and potentially put other susceptible cats at risk. Most cats will shed virus for a few weeks to months either continuously or intermittently. Occasionally persistent carriers are found which will shed virus indefinitely.15 The present study is the first PCR-based survey to determine the FCoV prevalence in the Malaysian cat colonies.",

Cattery A was privately owned and cattery B was managed by the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Malaysia. All cats at the SPCA were spayed or neutered upon entry into the shelter. Cats at both catteries were apparently healthy and were vaccinated (against feline rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, panleukopenia and Chlamydophila felis), dewormed with praziquantel (Drontal; Bayer Animal Health) and treated for fleas with fipronil (Frontline; Merial) accordingly. None of them received vaccination against FIP, feline leukaemia virus or rabies. Twenty-four purebred Persians were selected from cattery A and 20 mix-breed cats, consisting of cross-breed and domestic shorthair (DSH) cats, from cattery B. Faecal material was obtained by rectal swab or by collecting about 1 g of fresh faeces from the litter trays before morning cleaning. The faeces were suspended 1:10 (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored for a maximum of 48 h at 4\u00b0C. The faecal samples were then homogenised by vigorous vortexing (Finepcr; Korea), centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 \ng and the suspension stored at \u221270\u00b0C until used. RNA was extracted from faeces suspension using a Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA was determined by absorbance ratio measured at wavelength 260 nm and 280 nm using a spectrophotometer (Biophotometer Eppendorf, Germany). The primers (p 205 and p 211) were selected from a highly conserved region of 3\u2032untraslated region (UTR) of the virus genome.16 The reaction was first optimised using two FCoV reference strains; FECV79-1683 (American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) number VR-989) and FIPV79-1146 (ATCC number VR-990). The PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide and visualised with ultra-violet illumination and photographed using AlphaImager (Alpha Innotech, USA). Data analysis was performed using Statistical Tables Calculator, which is available online at http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/odds2\u00d72.html. Breed, age and gender differences were compared by calculating probability, odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P value. Values of P less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant.",

While the study was undertaken on a moderate number (44) of cats, the results are in agreement with those of Pedersen, who suggested that FCoV may persist in all catteries and shelters with more than six cats, and can be shed by 60% or more of pet cats in multi-cat households.19\n",

This observation is in accordance with previous reports that showed pedigree breeds are more susceptible to FCoV infections23 and have higher seroprevalence24, 25 and PCR positivity26 than cross-breed cats. However, cattery A also had a higher density of cats, and the cats were subjected to frequent breeding which may also influence the prevalence of infection. There are reports indicating that the number of cats per household has a significant influence on the FCoV infection rate25, 27 and the virus is highly prevalent in cat breeding institutions.26, 28 These factors may, therefore, have created an environment, which may have contributed to the higher FCoV prevalence.",

In this study, the prevalence of FCoV in Persian purebred cats was significantly higher than in a cat colony with mix-breed cats. There was no significant difference in FCoV prevalence either between young and old or between male and female cats.",
