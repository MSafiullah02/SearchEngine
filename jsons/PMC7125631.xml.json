Whereas the latter two represent long-term companions of the human species, HIV is a virus that spread in the human population only about 25 years ago and has a nonhuman primate origin [1]. In fact, most, if not all, of the recently emerging diseases go back to animal reservoirs, from which they infect humans through close contact during hunting and farming, in live animal markets or through food processing, preparation or consumption. An example is Ebola virus, which, after three outbreaks between 1976 and 1979, has appeared in the human population nine times since 1994, with each outbreak resulting from the handling of dead gorillas, chimpanzees or duikers, which in turn are thought to have been infected by an unknown natural host [2\u2022]. The variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jacob disease reached the population through the food chain, from \u2018rendered\u2019 sheep and cow carcasses fed to cows which were subsequently consumed by humans. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013coronavirus sequences from the earliest identified cases are identical to those found in palm civets and raccoon dogs in animal markets and farms [3\u2022], strongly suggesting an animal origin for this disease.",

Among the re-emerging diseases of the past few years, diphtheria and cholera should be mentioned [5], as well as the frequent appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the cases of anthrax infection as a result of deliberate release in 2001.",

This was the third time in the space of a few years (after the previous outbreaks of infection in 1997 and 2003) that H5N1 avian flu viruses caused disease and death in humans. An H9N2 avian strain caused infection in humans in 1999 and 2003. Because the world's population has not been exposed to these strains, it is immunologically na\u00efve, and these or any other avian flu strains with new surface glycoproteins would meet no resistance provided by existing immunity and could rapidly expand. Once an avian strain has developed a more efficient means of human-to-human transmission, devastating pandemics, such as those arising in 1918, 1957 and 1968, could ensue. It should be noted, however, that older studies found seroprevalence rates for avian flu strains among Chinese rural populations to be between 2% and 7% for H5 viruses and between 15% and 38% for other avian strains [6, 7]. Thus, it might in fact be the quality of surveillance, rather than the frequency of outbreaks, that has increased over the past few years [8]. However, the contact between humans and pathogens in animal reservoirs is likely to intensify, and, consequently, the emergence or re-emergence of diseases will occupy vaccinologists frequently in the future.",

Apart from almost complete lack of protection in the population, an additional threat of the avian flu H5N1 isolate from 2003 is that it kills embryonated eggs, the traditional virus growth substrate used for influenza vaccine production. Such problems can now be solved, owing to the discovery some years ago that influenza virus can be generated entirely from transfected DNA (reverse genetics [13, 14]). In this particular case, Webby et al. [15\u2022] have used polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis to replace the hemagglutinin cleavage site (which was shown to be the cause of high pathogenicity) of the H5N1 strain with the sequence from a nonpathogenic strain. Vero cells were then transfected with plasmids encoding the neuraminidase and mutated hemagglutinin from the circulating strain, together with the plasmids encoding the remaining proteins from the laboratory-optimized PR8 strain. The resulting vaccine strain was successfully grown in eggs and shown to be nonpathogenic and stable. Thus, the use of reverse genetics enables rapid production of a reference vaccine virus in response to the emergence of a new influenza variant [15\u2022, 16]. In addition, reverse genetics can be used for more far-reaching vaccination strategies, such as the construction of \u2018consensus\u2019 strains expressing conserved amino acid sequences or more than one version of the surface glycoproteins, or additional immunoenhancing molecules, such as cytokines [8]. Much research effort is also being invested into the development of improved cell culture systems that can replace completely the use of embryonated eggs in vaccine production and would render the production process more flexible and controllable.",

Both theoretical models [19] and trials [20] have shown that immunizing a high proportion of children, known to have a high rate of infection and an important role in transmission, also decreases the incidence of influenza in older age groups, a phenomenon known as herd immunity and described in previous trials in Michigan and Japan [21, 22].",

A total of 600 potential vaccine candidates were predicted by computer analysis, 350 of which were expressed and tested for immunogenicity [24]. Some of these candidates are now in clinical trials.

Plasmodium mutants deficient in one of these genes, uis3, are blocked in their early liver-stage development and all subsequent stages, and therefore do not lead to disease. When uis3-deficient sporozoites are used as genetically attenuated vaccines in mice, they confer long-lasting, stage-specific protection [29\u2022\u2022].

This fusion protein, together with unfused HBV surface antigen proteins, forms particles. The final vaccine formulation includes the adjuvant AS02A, an oil in water emulsion containing the immunostimulants monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and Quillaja saponaria fraction 21. It had previously been shown that, indeed, a CD4+ T cell response to an epitope contained in the vaccine correlates with protection from infection and disease [31\u2022].

It has become clear that the degree and type of antigen-specific, clonal B and T cell responses (acquired immunity) depend crucially on the prior action of a more ancient system of pathogen detection (innate immunity). This system relies on the activation of antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) upon recognition of patterns common to viruses and bacteria and largely absent in mammals. With the discovery of the involved pattern recognition receptors, among which the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent an important subgroup, immune-enhancing molecules or adjuvants can no longer be considered as the alchemistic \u2018immunologist's dirty secret\u2019 but have become amenable to rational design, providing a huge potential for manipulating the immune response. As different TLR agonists elicit different types of immune responses (reviewed in [59]), future adjuvants might be able to tailor the immune response so that optimal protection to a given pathogen is induced. In fact, the number of clinical trials involving TLR agonists as new adjuvants is ever increasing [32, 33] (Table 1\n).",

An additional effect of CpG oligonucleotides appears to be the promotion of affinity maturation and, as a result, a higher overall affinity of the vaccine-specific antibody pool [37\u2022]. Similarly, the TLR4 agonist MPL has been shown in the past to enhance the immune response to HBV vaccination in humans [38].

[39\u2022] showed that the ability of adjuvants to elicit a Th1 type response depends crucially on the recruitment of, and IFN-\u03b3 production by, natural killer (NK) cells, which indicates a possible mechanism of the way in which adjuvants direct the type of adaptive immune response induced downstream. Another vaccine approach is the use of heat shock proteins, which bind specifically and activate dendritic cells and, because they are loaded with endogenous peptides, can be purified from tumor cells and function as a combined antigen delivery system and adjuvant [40].",

The same mechanism might be at work in mycobacterium infection of macrophages, where apoptosis was shown to enhance crosspresentation by bystander DCs [45].

A particularly promising approach is a heterologous prime-boost strategy, where administration of plasmid DNA is followed by recombinant virus (modified vaccinia virus Ankara [MVA] or adenovirus) expressing the same antigen. This regimen induced strong T cell responses against P. falciparum in na\u00efve adults [48] and enhanced the response in Gambian men who are constantly exposed to P. falciparum [49]. Although partial protection against challenge with a different P. falciparum strain was observed, no significant differences in the infection rate was found in the Gambian trial [50\u2022].

Focusing on the blood and metastases from a patient with complete regression, these studies reconfirmed earlier observations that the frequency of anti-tumor T cells can be relatively high. Although vaccination leads to a slight increase in vaccine-specific T cells, these remain only a small fraction of total anti-tumor T cells. By contrast, T cells directed against epitopes not contained in the vaccine represent the vast majority of anti-tumor cells, and their frequency increases both in the blood and in metastases. Thus, it appears that with the appropriate vaccine regimen, the inefficiency of pre-existing specific T cells to combat the tumor was reversed in an indirect manner, presumably by activating another subset of T cells. It remains to be clarified, however, how much of this reactivation is due to the action of vaccine-induced T cells and how much is a general, antigen-independent immune-enhancing effect. In any case, for the development of therapeutic vaccines, it will be vital to understand how the balance can be tipped back from a state of tolerance to a successful immune response.",

So far, the PS used in large-scale vaccine production has been purified from the pathogen itself, grown in large quantities \u2013 an approach that is costly and difficult to control. Through great simplification of the carbohydrate chemistry involved, Verez-Bencomo et al. [57\u2022] have now demonstrated the first large-scale production of an anti-Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, consisting of synthetic PS conjugated to tetanus toxoid protein carrier. This vaccine has been shown to be as efficient as commercially available vaccines in inducing protective levels of antibody titers in infants.",

Never before have such sophisticated techniques and an in-depth knowledge of immunological processes been at hand to exploit fully the potential of protecting from, as well as curing, diseases through vaccination. A formidable task in the future will be the development of effective therapeutic vaccines, in situations where chronic antigen exposure by itself does not elicit a sufficiently strong immune response, as is the case in cancer and chronic infectious diseases. Compared with vaccines against self-limiting infections, where the aim is to be as good as the real pathogen (but less harmful), this requires the development of vaccines that are better than the natural antigens in inducing immunity. All of our knowledge will be necessary to succeed in this challenge.",

            "text": "Figure 1: Possible intervention points for vaccine improvement. Schematic view of a pathogen- or vaccine-induced immune response. Vaccines or pathogens cross epithelial barriers and are taken up by antigen-presenting cells such as DCs. Interaction between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and their agonists activate DCs, resulting in increased antigen presentation, cytokine production and co-stimulation. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognize antigen presented by DCs and are activated. Cognate interaction between primed CD4+ T cells and B cells activates the B cells, resulting in clonal expansion and antibody production. DC activation also leads to inhibition of the regulatory effect of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. Fully activated CD8+ cells can target tumor cells and pathogen-infected cells. The letters (a\u2013i) indicate processes where improved vaccines can lead to more efficient immune responses: (a) The site of administration influences the type of immune response and enables the usage of lower vaccine doses [19, 20]. (b) Particulate antigen is taken up more easily by macrophages and DCs than soluble antigen [47]. (c) TLR agonists and other immunostimulants binding to PRRs increase the activation of DCs [32, 33, 34, 35, 36\u2022, 37\u2022, 38, 40]. (d) DCs matured and loaded with antigen in vitro are efficient vaccines [41\u2022\u2022, 42, 43]. (e) DNA vaccination leads to efficient antigen presentation on MHC class I [48, 49, 50\u2022, 51\u2022\u2022, 52, 53]. Crosspresentation of antigen on MHC class I of host DCs is facilitated after vaccination with antigen-loaded DCs undergoing delayed apoptosis [44\u2022]. (f) Cytokines can be added in protein or DNA form as natural adjuvants [32, 33]. (g) Recruited NK cells can be an early source of Th1-driving cytokines [39\u2022]. (h) Vaccines can break tolerance when the suppressive effect of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells is overcome [54\u2022]. (i) Pre-existing T cells specific for tumor antigens not contained in the vaccine expand after vaccination and predominate in the antitumor response [55\u2022, 56\u2022].",
