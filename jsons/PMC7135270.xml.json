I suggest we develop the clout and expertise to influence the course of international affairs. We live in halcyon days of global public health, buoyed by the Gates-Buffett effect,1 but there are some health outcomes that money will not be able to buy, because powerful nations actively pursue foreign-policy agendas detrimental to health. This new approach would be prevention of the highest order. Imagine influencing trade agreements at their inception so that the food security of millions is assured and shortages averted. Imagine knowing enough about world finance to change the international financial institutions' conditions for loans that create health inequities. Imagine health as a human right with legal teeth, replacing the current mechanisms that require nation states to provide protections for their citizens, even when that same state is a perpetrator. Business as usual in these non-health settings has serious international public-health ramifications.2 The business of high politics has not traditionally fallen within remit of what is understood as global health.3, 4 But it should.",

Cooperation is inarguably a powerful tool for the management of global health, as the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome proved.5 But cooperation as a lone strategy for meeting all global-health objectives is naive when competition between states informs the dominant paradigm, realism, that has shaped relations from Whitehall to Washington for the past century. Realism in international affairs is not about seeing things as they really are, but rather refers to a philosophical doctrine that every international-relations undergraduate learns during their first semester: states are the primary agents in international affairs, states selfishly pursue their national interests, and sovereign states use laws and institutions to pursue these interests.6 In such a framework, health is expendable when other interests, such as national security, are perceived to be at risk.",

Global-health realities are at odds with the prevailing paradigm. International public-health professionals compound this problem if they have too little understanding of the mindsets (of which realism is only one), histories, and concomitant power structures behind foreign policy and international affairs. International public-health professionals too commonly assume that the value of good population health\u2014to individual societies and to the global community\u2014is self-evident and that they should not really have to work too hard to compete with other agendas.",
