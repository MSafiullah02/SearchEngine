            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem in cattle herds (Gulliksen et al., 2009b), and BRD can be classified as the most important welfare health problem in calves. Financial losses related to BRD are due to animal mortality, body weight loss, yield loss, veterinary fees and medical cost. Although respiratory disease can be found in cattle of all ages, during the decline of passive immunity, weaning time and entrance into the feedlot, calves are most susceptible due to the intensive stress and exposure to pathogens (Muggli-Cockett et al., 1992). On a Dutch dairy farm where 60% of the heifers younger than 3 months old were infected, \u20ac31.2 in economic losses were estimated per heifer due to pneumonia. In the same study, it was shown that the calculated losses for one seasonal outbreak were \u20ac27.0 per heifer up to 15 months old (Van Der Fels-Klerx et al., 2001). Furthermore, the estimated annual economic loss due to respiratory tract infections is over $600 million in the USA (Smith, 2000). The contribution of BRD to the total morbidity cases in the USA was estimated to be approximately 75% and was similarly reported to be 50\u201370% of all feedlot deaths (Edwards, 1996, Galyean et al., 1999, Loneragan et al., 2001). The spread of BRD infections among young populations is extremely rapid: 91% of calves can be infected with BRD within the first 27 days after arrival to a feedlot (Buhman et al., 2000). An insufficient level of maternally derived antibodies (Kimman et al., 1988) and adrenocortical-immunosuppressive factors, i.e., stress, crowded barns or bad shelter conditions, can lead to an increased incidence of infection in calves (Gulliksen et al., 2009b).",

BVD viruses can persist in the cattle population through persistently infected individuals (IPI) (Mcclurkin et al., 1984), and BHV-1 may create lifelong latency after primary infection (Ackermann et al., 1982); it was also reported that BRSV and BCoV may persist within herds (Heckert et al., 1991, Valarcher et al., 2001). Virus clearance between outbreaks (Alenius et al., 1991, Elvander, 1996) and the re-introduction of new viral strains (Larsen et al., 2000) has been reported, and the seasonal incidence of BRD cases is generally higher during autumn and winter (Stott et al., 1980).",

The antibody response against BVDV can reach a detectable level at 2\u20133 weeks after infection (Howard et al., 1992). In addition to maternal antibodies, early-life infections may also cause an increase in this antibody. Thus, it can be postulated that the situation observed indicates that the BVD virus may circulate in the early period of life after birth. Another possibility is an intrauterine infection just prior to parturition. Hence, some calves can be seropositive at month 1 due to primary BVDV infection rather than maternal immunity. For PI-3, an increase in the number of seropositive calves at second month occurred, but unlike BVDV, the geometric mean antibody titer value was decreased (Table 4, Table 5). The development of a low titer antibody response in infected calves and high rates of maternal antibody catabolization are thought to be the causes of the reduction in the geometric mean antibody titer for PI-3. Here, the presence of early-period infection can also be postulated.",

Thus, the importance of herd size may be matter of discussion for these viruses. In earlier studies (Ye\u015filba\u011f and G\u00fcng\u00f6r, 2008, Raaperi et al., 2012), studied populations were sampled only once, with the relationship between herd size and infection seroprevalence being determined. In the present study, the sampled population was followed up for 1 year (8 times). Consequently, the difference between this study and earlier ones may originate from the different survey methods. At this point, the number of seronegative individuals in the herd and the prevalence of infection can be more relatable to the prevalence of infection than the herd size. Some other factors, such as the route of transmission, propagation velocity, farm-animal density in the region, direct contact rate of the animals, number of visitors, and biosafety rules, should also be taken into consideration. Given these criteria, when the capacity of a herd is increased, direct contact between animals and the number of visitors will increase automatically. Therefore, herd size can be classified as one of the main risk factors for respiratory infections but not the only reason.",

Despite high values of BCoV mean antibody titer, no correlation was detected (data not shown). One of the possible causes of this situation is the implementation of vaccine against BCoV at the end of pregnancy to increase the antibody titer in colostrum.

According to results of this study, a first vaccination of calves against respiratory viruses between the 2nd and 4th months is recommended. Due to the nature of inactivated vaccines, a booster dose is also advisable. Another important result of this study is the possible introduction of infections after the 8th month of age. Therefore, re-vaccination of animals at 6 months after the booster dose may be useful. To extend the level and duration of maternal immunity, vaccination of dams may be beneficial prior to the birth of the calf.
