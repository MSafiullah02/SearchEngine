As of March 7, 2020, more than 100,000 cases of disease have been confirmed globally.1 Although most patients show mild symptoms, 26% of them develop severe and critical diseases2; notably, they may exhibit acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is an important cause of COVID-2019-associated death. Patients with severe/critical disease generally receive symptomatic treatments such as antiviral therapy, anti-infection therapy, and maintenance of a stable internal environment; during such treatment, timely and effective oxygen therapy is essential. Conventional oxygen therapy by nasal catheter is only suitable for patients with mild disease; non-invasive mechanical ventilation requires man\u2013machine cooperation and is uncomfortable. Here, we describe eight patients with COVID-2019 who were treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); our findings suggest that HFNC is a suitable choice for treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-2019.",

Seven of the eight patients exhibited underlying disease, including four with hypertension, three with diabetes mellitus, two with cerebral infarction, one with rheumatic disease, one with chronic renal insufficiency, and one with gastrointestinal bleeding (Table 1\n). While receiving general treatment such as antiviral therapy (i.e., lopinavir/ritonavir, Interferon-\u03b1), anti-infection therapy, and nutritional support, all eight patients received low doses and short courses of corticosteroid treatment; four patients were treated with tocilizumab.",

Blood-gas analysis before receipt of HFNC treatment showed that the mean oxygenation index (partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen, P/F) of the eight patients was 259.88\u00b158.15 mmHg; six patients had developed ARDS, with a mean pneumonia severity index of 3.62\u00b11.19. The initial oxygen concentration was set at 100%. After 2 hours of HFNC treatment, the rate of oxygenation (ROX) index was calculated as SpO2/(fraction of inspired oxygen \u00d7 respiratory rate) in accordance with the method used by Roca et al.3 The ROX indices were \u2265 4.88 in all patients; the patients were monitored continuously for 12 hours, and the ROX indices remained \u2265 4.88, indicating a high success rate of HFNC treatment. After 24 hours, the SpO2 was maintained between 95% and 100%; the P/F increased to 280\u2013450 mmHg. During the course of treatment, the oxygen concentration decreased gradually; patients were switched to conventional oxygen therapy after a mean of 7.38\u00b12.07 days, when their conditions were improved (Table 1).

Although guidelines also recommend noninvasive ventilation when ARDS or hypoxemia cannot be alleviated after standard oxygen therapy,7 HFNC has more advantages, compared with noninvasive ventilation, in isolation wards. First, most patients with severe/critical disease are elderly patients, typically unaccompanied by family members; the unfamiliar uniforms of the medical staff and panic regarding the disease will increase their anxiety, while claustrophobia caused by non-invasive ventilation can worsen the situation. Indeed, a 91-year-old patient with comorbid Alzheimer's disease required treatment with sedative and antianxiety drugs due to severe anxiety and panic. Second, non-invasive ventilation requires man\u2013machine cooperation, which may be difficult for elderly patients; the extent of this cooperation directly affects the efficiency of oxygen therapy. Third, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients increased rapidly in a short period of time, resulting in a shortage of intensive care physicians and respiratory therapists who can provide patients with noninvasive ventilation; notably, HFNC can be easily implemented and managed by general physicians. Therefore, HFNC constitutes a good treatment option for patients with COVID-2019. Importantly, none of the patients admitted to our hospital with severe/critical disease required noninvasive ventilation; only one patient received endotracheal intubation to prevent death.",
