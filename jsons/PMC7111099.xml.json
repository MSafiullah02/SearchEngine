These complexes begin their association through intermolecular disulfide bonds in the ER, after the monomers have acquired intramolecular disulfide bonds and have been released from calnexin [11]. To explore the role of co- and post-translationally formed disulfide bonds on the steady-state level of the BVDV glycoproteins expressed in MDBK cells, we employed a method described by several laboratories, in which the membrane permeable reducing agent DTT is used to produce proteins lacking disulfide bonds [15], [16].",

Five millimolar DTT was added to the cells 9 h pi, and synthesis of viral proteins was allowed to proceed in either presence or absence of the reducing agent for up to 2 h. The expression of E2 glycoproteins was analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE under reducing condition, followed by Western blotting. The MAb 214 antibodies, which recognize both the nonreduced and reduced forms of BVDV E2 glycoproteins [11], were used to detect the viral proteins. As expected, in untreated samples the E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins accumulated inside the cells due to continuous transcription and translation of viral RNA. Interestingly, the signal corresponding to E2/E2-p7 proteins in the DTT-treated samples decreased dramatically after only 0.5 h treatment and was almost completely lost at the end of the 2 h incubation period (Fig. 1A\n, upper panel). This suggests that either the biosynthesis of the E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins is impaired or the newly synthesized viral proteins are degraded in the presence of DTT, or that both events may contribute to the same effect. In the DTT-treated samples, the amount of E2/E2-p7 neither increases nor remains constant, which suggests that the viral proteins present in the cell prior to DTT incubation are also, to a certain extent, affected by the DTT treatment. As a sample loading control, detection of a soluble, cytoplasm-resident protein (actin), and a transmembrane, ER-localized protein (calnexin) was performed on the same Western blot (Fig. 1A, lower panel).",

To determine if exogenously added DTT interferes with the formation of these rapidly acquired disulfide bonds, BVDV-infected MDBK cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min in the absence or continuous presence of DTT. The radioactively labeled viral proteins were then immunoprecipitated using MAb 214 and migrated on SDS\u2013PAGE under nonreducing (nr) and reducing (r) conditions (Fig. 1B). In the untreated (\u2212DTT) sample oxidation of the E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins occurs normally, as shown by the difference in the migration pattern between nonreduced and reduced samples, whereas the proteins pulsed in the presence of DTT showed an identical migration both under nonreducing and reducing conditions. Strikingly, more than 50% of the viral protein is lost in the presence of DTT, as revealed by scan densitometry analysis, suggesting that preventing the formation of disulfide bonds results in the synthesis of an unstable protein that is rapidly targeted for degradation. The difference in the intensities of the bands corresponding to the E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins run under nonreducing and reducing conditions is due to a more efficient elution of the bound proteins from protein G\u2013Sepharose beads under reducing conditions.",

BVDV-infected MDBK cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min and chased for 15 min in the absence of the reducing agent to allow normal folding and formation of the disulfide bonds to occur. After this initial chase, 5 mM DTT was added to the cells and the chase continued for additional 15 min. The cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with MAb 214 and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 2A\n). We have previously shown that within the first 30 min post-translation, the E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins exist mainly in the form of monomers, which will only later begin to associate into E2\u2013E2 homodimers and E1\u2013E2 heterodimers [11]. Therefore, within the 15 min of post-translational DTT treatment only the monomers will be exposed. As shown in Fig. 2A, the E2/E2-p7 monomers are oxidized normally (compare lanes nr and r, \u2212DTT) in the untreated sample, while there is no difference in the migration pattern of the E2/E2-p7 proteins between the nonreduced and the reduced sample in DTT-treated samples. This suggests that the disulfide bonds of the E2/E2-p7 monomers were accessible to and reduced by DTT. Moreover, the intensity of the bands corresponding to the BVDV glycoproteins was reduced by approximately 25% in the presence of DTT, as compared to untreated sample, suggesting that reduced monomers are in an unstable conformation and therefore targeted to degradation. To investigate further the kinetics of this degradation we extended the chase for 0.5, 1, and 2 h. As shown in Fig. 2B, the amount of viral proteins immunoprecipitated with MAb 214 decreased dramatically throughout the chase in the DTT-treated samples, suggesting that the reduced monomers were unable to oligomerize and accumulate in the ER, and were targeted for degradation instead.",

However, the degradation of reduced BVDV E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins follows a rather unprecedented kinetic (Fig. 2B). We therefore attempted to determine whether glycan processing by the ER-mannosidases is also involved in this fast degradation. An experiment similar to that described in Fig 3A was performed and DMJ was used to inhibit the ER-mannosidase activity [19]. As shown in Fig. 3B, the inhibitor greatly suppressed the proteasome-associated degradation of reduced E2/E2-p7 proteins confirming that removal of mannose from asparagine-linked oligosaccharides precedes the viral protein proteolysis.",

Then 5-mM DTT was added to the cells and the chase continued for 1 h in presence of the reducing agent. The cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with MAb 214 and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 4\n). Interestingly, the intensity of the bands corresponding to E2/E2-p7 monomers was reduced by approximately 50% in the DTT-treated sample, as compared to only 10% reduction of the bands corresponding to the E1/E2 heterodimers (see nr lanes, \u2213DTT). To better estimate the degree of the overall degradation of the E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins, we compared the intensities of the corresponding bands under reducing conditions (see r lanes, \u2213DTT). The scan densitometry analysis showed that only a minor proportion of the E2/E2-p7 proteins was degraded (approximately 20%) after 1 h DTT treatment post-dimer formation. In contrast, 1 h DTT treatment of the E2/E2-p7 monomers resulted in a significant degradation (see Fig. 2B). Therefore, once the envelope proteins have assembled into dimers, the conformation of the complex is such that the disulfide bonds become resistant to disruption by DTT.",

In our system, DTT treatment during translation led to a massive reduction in the amount of viral protein accumulated during the pulse, suggesting that formation of co-translational disulfide bonds is crucial for achieving a stable conformation of the E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins. Failure to form these bonds could lead to abnormally folded molecules, which are rapidly degraded. To determine the fate of the E2/E2-p7 monomers when their assembly and oligomerization is prevented we performed a post-pulse DTT treatment experiment. This approach allowed proper oxidation of the monomers but prevented any further disulfide bond formation. It has been shown that several viral as well as cellular proteins acquire DTT resistance after some folding has taken place [15], [23]. Interestingly, reduction of the disulfide bonds in the BVDV E2/E2-p7 monomers and prevention of the oligomerization process resulted in their degradation. This result suggests that at this stage of the envelope protein biosynthesis, their folding is not complete. Therefore, the disruption of the disulfide bonds before final folding has achieved results in a disordered structure similar to that found when formation of the bonds is inhibited co-translationally. This confirms the earlier result that co-translationally formed disulfide bonds are crucial for the subsequent folding of BVDV E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins into their native forms.",

This hypothesis was further confirmed using an ER-mannosidase inhibitor that prevents formation of Man8GlcNAc2 glycoproteins, a prerequisite for targeting misfolded glycoproteins to proteasome-mediated degradation.

Forcing the viral proteins to adopt a reduced conformation at different stages of virus maturation process resulted in failure to acquire a stable conformation and led to proteasome-mediated degradation. It is interesting to note that the antiviral iminosugar N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, an ER-\u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor, induces misfolding of BVDV E2/E2-p7 glycoproteins associated with at least one disulfide-bonded epitope [11]. Although in this case the viral proteins are not roughly misfolded and degraded in the ER, the assembly of the E1\u2013E2 heterodimers is impaired, suggesting again that proper disulfide bonding is important for achieving a native conformation of the E2/E2-p7 monomers that would enable their subsequent assembly into functional heterodimers.",
