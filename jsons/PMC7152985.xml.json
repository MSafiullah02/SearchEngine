            "text": "Natural products are comprised of a large number of structurally complex molecules, the structural diversity of which sometimes far exceeds the abilities of chemists and their equipment within the laboratories. In addition to the fascinating diverse structures, many natural compounds possess intriguing biological properties. Building blocks of natural origin are being used as a plentiful source of lead compounds for drug discovery. Euphorbiaceae family composed of five subfamilies, 49 tribes, 317 genera, and about 8000 species, is one of the biggest families with probably the highest species richness in many habitats (Webster 1986). Exposure to a large range of habitats predisposed Euphorbia species to unavoidable high mutation loads caused by stressful habitats. The presence of environmental stimuli had necessitated the development of rich storage of defensive secondary metabolites (Mwine and Van Damme 2011). The botanical name \u201cEuphorbia\u201d derives from the Greek \u201cEuphorbius\u201d in honour to the physician of Mauritania, who is assumed to have used in his treatment a certain plant (Euphorbia resinifera) with a milky latex (Appendino and Szallasi 1997). Moreover, this plant family is known also as \u201cspurge\u201d derived from the Latin \u201cexpurgare\u201d, which means \u201cto cleanse\u201d referring to the early traditional application of these plants as purgative medication (Burkill 1994). Euphorbiaceae species had played an important role in traditional ethnomedicine as mentioned in the Greek and Roman medical literature for the treatment of toothache, to remove warts, as purgatives, and in asthma and bronchial catarrh (Lawant and Winthagen 2002). They are also part of different herbal remedies used in traditional Chinese medicines and ayurvedic medicine for similar indications (Kapoor 2017; Liang et al. 2009). Over the last decades, several Euphorbiaceae constituents have successfully been employed in clinical trials or applied as lead structures for the development of novel drugs. Species of this family are prolific producers of unique diterpenoids (Singla and Kamla 1990) of great biomedical relevance (Evans and Taylor 1983), the promising biological properties of which have attracted interests of phytochemists to the isolation of Euphorbiaceae constituents. One of the largest chemical classes isolated from the milky latices of Euphorbiaceae species is macrocyclic diterpenes based on jatrophane, lathyrane, terracinolide, ingenane, pepluane, paraliane, and segetane skeletons, many of which show interesting pharmacological properties. When \u2018jatrophone\u2019, the first jatrophane-type diterpene, isolated by Kupchan and co-workers in 1970 from Jatropha gossypiifolia L. as a natural product with significant antiproliferative effects against human tumor cell lines, the biological and chemical interest in the jatrophane structures greatly increased (Kupchan et al. 1970). Modified jatrophanes consist of \u201csegetanes\u201d, \u201cparalianes\u201d, \u201cpepluanes\u201d, and \u201cterracinolides\u201d. \u201cEuphoractanes\u201d being occasionally considered as modified jatrophanes or modified lathyrane skeletons, were a black box for decades and there was no biosynthesis or chemical conversion evidence to support or oppose different biogenesis proposals. In this regard, the recently published article by Wang et al. (2019) has mentioned the proposal suggested by Haiming et al. (2008) in which it had been claimed that euphoractane skeletons come from macrocyclic jatrophanes. Subsequently, Wang et al. in 2019 have certainly demonstrated that euphoractane skeletons are obtained by the treatment of lathyrane-type diterpene (Euphorbia Factor L1) with BF3.ET2O in ethyl acetate at room temperature and it has confirmed the biogenesis relationship between the euphoractanes and lathyranes by chemical conversion method for the first time. Hereupon, euphoractanes are not considered as modified jatrophane skeletons (Wang et al. 2019). Vasas and Hohmann (2014) have published a worthwhile review article of the represented papers on all diterpenoids isolated from Euphorbia between 2008 and 2012, parts of which include jatrophane and modified jatrophane diterpenes (Vasas and Hohmann 2014). Moreover, another comprehensive review article has been published by Shi et al. (2008) of the papers written on the chemical and pharmacological aspects of the plants in genus Euphorbia over the past few decades (Shi et al. 2008). Meanwhile, the vacancy of a review article intensely focusing on jatrophane diterpenes was sensated. Therefore, this present review article has been aimed at giving in depth coverage of the papers published from 1984 to March 2019 particularly on the jatrophanes and rearranged jatrophane-type diterpenes, with emphasis on their biogenesis, isolation, structure, biological activity and structure activity relationship.\n",

Jatrophane is a bicyclic pentadecane skeleton (Fig. 5) without the cyclopropane ring (Evans and Taylor 1983) which is biosynthesized either directly from above mentioned cembrene cation through Wagner-Meerwein rearrangements or through the more likely casbene pathway. In the biosynthesis of jatrophane from casbene rout, casbene precursor is formed first, followed by the opening of the cyclopropane ring, and then closure of the five-membered ring between C-6 and C-10 to form jatrophane core (Fig. 2) (Adolf and Hecker 1977; Lanzotti 2013). According to a different point of view, jatrophanes may be derived from lathyranes by cyclopropane ring being opened (Appendino 2016; Lanzotti 2013).",

A proposed biogenetic pathway for the rare 12,17-cyclojatrophanes has been illustrated in Fig. 7. It appears that Jatrophanes (119\u2013122) are biogenetically interrelated. In this regards, the 11,12-epoxidation of a favorable \u03946(17), \u039411-jatrophane precursor results in epoxiwelwitschene whose epoxide ring can undergo a nucleophilic attack in two different ways. Epoxy ring-opening by the 15-hydroxyl group nucleophilic attack causes the formation of a tetrahydrofuran ring, leading to welwitschene (route b) with 12,17-cyclojatrophane structure. In a second way, the attack by the 6(17)-exomethylene gives rise to a 12,17-transannular cyclization (route a). This 12,17-cyclojatrophane intermediate would then subsequently go through dehydration at C-11. Epoxidation of the resulting double bond and oxidation at C-2 affords salicifoline which is another rare structural feature of euphowelwitschine A and has been isolated from Euphorbia salicifolia to date (route c) (Hohmann et al. 2001b). Euphowelwitschines A and B supposed to be formed via epoxide ring-opening by the free hydroxyl at C-15 (route d) (Fig. 7) (Reis et al. 2015). This 12,15-ether bridge is not common in macrocyclic jatrophanes; the only compounds that have such functionality were isolated exclusively from Euphorbia helioscopia (Kosemura et al. 1985; Lu et al. 2008; Yamamura et al. 1989).",

Through this biosynthetic pathway, the intermediate bearing four double bonds is formed by an elimination reaction on a proper jatrophane; after that this intermediate can be transformed into a segetane via a Diels\u2013Alder reaction in the presence of a Lewis base and/or a Lewis acid (Fig. 10). The study of the generalization of this reaction proved that the presence of a carbonyl at C-9 and lack of substitution at C-8 are indispensable to the formation of a segetane skeleton from a jatrophane skeleton (Wan et al. 2016b).",

This attachment of a two-carbon fragment to C-17 could arise from the opening of a 5,17-epoxide by nucleophilic attack on a C2 unit (acetate or malonate) followed by cyclization with a proximate hydroxyl group to give a \u03b4-lactone ring (Marco et al. 1997) (Fig. 12).",

            "text": "It is worth mentioning that the flexibility of the twelve-membered ring can adopt two main conformations: endo- and exo-type depending on the spatial orientation of the 6,17 exo-methylene group (Appendino et al. 1998; Jakupovic et al. 1998b, c; Marco et al. 1998). It is also reported that the conformational option depends on the acylation pattern on the jatrophane core (Corea et al. 2005a; Esposito et al. 2016; G\u00fcnther et al. 1998). Diagnostic spectral features to discriminate between the two conformations are the 3J4,5 value and spatial close NOESY correlations (Appendino et al. 1998; Corea et al. 2005a; Jakupovic et al. 1998c). The large 3J4,5 = 9\u201311 Hz coupling and the existence of a diagnostic NOESY cross-peak between H-5 and H-17, due to the perpendicular orientation of the exomethylene group to the mean plane of the macrocycle would advocate for a perpendicular endo-type conformation whereas small 3J4,5 = 0\u20134 Hz coupling and interactions between H-4/H-7 and H-5/H-8 along with no interaction between H-5 or H-7 and the exomethylenic H-17 could indicate a parallel exo-type conformation (Appendino et al. 1998;Jakupovic et al. 1998a, b, c; Marco et al. 1998). For jatrophanes, conformational flexibility was reported to be important for P-gp modulation, since molecules with the macrocyclic jatrophane-type twelve-membered ring scaffold were generally found to be more active than the 5/8/8 fused ring systems like welwitschines A and B. Similar observations were also found for rearranged polycyclic jatrophanes like segetane, paraliane and pepluane skeletons showing a lower P-gp modulatory efficiency when compared to molecules with the macrocyclic jatrophane-type scaffold (Ferreira et al. 2014; Reis et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Diterpenes are generally isolated from various Euphorbia species by similar protocols. All parts of the plants may accumulate diterpenoids. The roots, leaves, stems, fruits, seeds and the whole plant are equally studied. Furthermore, Euphorbia plants are known to produce white irritant latex-containing different metabolites such as macrocyclic diterpenoids (Nothias-Scaglia et al. 2014, 2015a, c) and hence, it is commonly investigated as well (Fattorusso et al. 2002; Shi et al. 2008; Vasas and Hohmann 2014). In general, extraction of the plant materials performs at room temperature by maceration. The extracts are evaporated at reduced pressure at 40 \u00b0C. Since the plants produce complex mixtures of structurally-related analogues whose core is the same and are differed from each other by the substitution pattern, then their isolation requires a multistep separation protocol. Mustafa Ghanadian and coworkers developed a five-step method for isolation and purification of macrocyclic diterpenes in nine Euphorbia species. The sample preparation includes: (A) the percolation or maceration of powdered plant material with CH2Cl2:acetone (2:1) at room temperature, (B) extract is suspended in MeOH:H2O (75:25) after concentration and subjected to vacuum filtration using a porcelain Buchner funnel with a vacuum pump and a large glass funnel filter with fritted sintered glass disc containing RP-18 adsorbent or silica gel pregnated with paraffin (15%), eluting with MeOH:H2O (75:25) as solvent, (C) the defatted fraction which is rich in diterpenoids and free from dark green chlorophylls and fats, is concentrated and loaded on the gravity silica gel column using mixtures comprising hexane: EtOAc of increasing polarity, D) resultant fractions being rich in macrocyclic diterpenoids are selected based on primary 1H-NMR analysis and are subjected to Sephadex LH-20 eluting by hexane:acetone:MeOH (30:10:60) to remove remaining chlorophyll and unwanted materials and to gain crude diterpenoidal subfraction. The concentrated fractions are screened by TLC using hexane:acetone (6:4) and (7:3) as mobile phases. TLCs are Sprayed by concentrated serium sulphate 1% in sulfuric acid 10% followed by heating at 105 \u00b0C for the visualization of the polyester diterpene spots visulalized in dark brown color spots with Rf values of 0.2\u20130.7. E) Fractions which are rich in diterpenes are subjected on silica prep HPLC column (20 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) using hexane:EtOAc in stepwise gradient solvent system (90:10; 85:15; 80:20; 75:25; 70:30) as final purification (Ayatollahi et al. 2010a, b, Ghanadian et al. 2013, 2015; Zolfaghari et al. 2016).",

To discover more desirable biological analogues with mechanisms similar to that of paclitaxel, they focused on the action of these compounds on tubulin function, both in the assembly of purified tubulin and in living cells. These jatrophanes did not interfere with GTP-induced tubulin assembly in contrast to the other microtubule-interacting drugs; instead, they induced the formation of tubulin polymers rapidly in the absence of other promoters. Besides, jatrophane polymerization products were destabilized and disassembled by calcium ions unlike those of paclitaxel (Schiff and Horwitz 1980). In addition, no irregular tubulin polymerization products were formed. In this regard, jatrophanes interact with the tubulin differently from paclitaxel and their biological activity cannot be caused by suppression of microtubule dynamics, which is the target of many microtubule-interacting agents. At a cellular level, jatrophanes reorganize microtubules without inducing microtubule bundling in contrast to the common tubulin-polymerizing agents. These results depicted that jatrophane polyesters from E. semiperfoliata can represent a new type of active tubulin-interacting pharmacophores (Miglietta et al. 2003).",

The results depicted that all (425\u2013431) inhibited NADH oxidase activity, with IC50 values ranging from 5.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M for 371 to 13.9 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5M for 366. The performing SAR studies showed that 344, the strongest inhibitor, displayed an isobutyrate group at C-7 leading to an IC50 value of 6.3 \u03bcM. Less active compounds (426 and 427) had an acetoxy group at C-7. Even 429 with an isobutyrate group at C-7 and an acetoxy group at C-2 showed a reduction in NADH oxidase inhibitory. Accordingly, it was proposed that the presence of acetoxy groups at C-2 and C-7 reduces the inhibitory effect on the NADH oxidase activity. The suggested mechanism was associated with the inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that arose from the breakdown of the transmembrane mitochondrial potential, resulting in early apoptosis (Betancur-Galvis et al. 2003).",

Induced ROS production in Caov-4 and OVCAR-3 was evaluated 2.6 and 4.4 for 131; and 4.7 and 9.9 fold/control for 343, respectively.

            "text": "In chemotherapy, P-gp is a membrane protein that confers upon cells the ability to resist lethal doses of certain cytotoxic drugs by pumping them out of the cells leading to a reduction of their cytotoxic or anti-proliferation effects (Barile et al. 2008b). The presence of P-gp transport proteins in the microorganism membrane makes also challenge the treatment of the infectious diseases, as they cause a mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) developed during treatment, by pumping out anti-infectious drugs (Schnabel and Hiersemann 2009; Schnabel et al. 2010; Shukla et al. 1999; Sutherland and Polley 2011). The emergence of cancer MDR has been pointed out as one of the major barriers to successful chemotherapy. The most well-known mode of resistance has been associated with P-gp (ATB-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1)/P-gp), the first human ABC transporter to be described. The overexpression of ABCB1 results in reduced intracellular concentration of drugs to levels leading to treatment failure, causing also cross-resistance or cross-sensitivity to other drugs (Gottesman et al. 2002). To enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent MDR. Developing the molecules that are able to impair the drug efflux mediated by ABCB1 as well as the development of collateral sensitivity agents lay among the most promising strategies (Callaghan et al. 2014; Szak\u00e1cs et al. 2014). Therefore, potent and selective P-gp inhibitors are potential targeted agents to combat chemotherapy drug resistance. In drug discovery programs for cancer MDR, a large number of compounds have been investigated (Eid et al. 2015; Palmeira et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2011) among which the polyoxygenated jatrophane and lathyrane-type macrocyclic diterpenes from Euphorbia species have shown potential anti-MDR activities, by ABCB1 modulation and/or by selective targeting of MDR cancer cells (Corea et al. 2009; Vasas and Hohmann 2014; Vieira et al. 2014).",

These compounds were investigated for the reversal of MDR in L5178 mouse lymphoma cells using the rhodamine 123 (Rho123) exclusion test. 375, 376, and 467 displayed a significant effect on inhibiting the efflux-pump activity of multidrug-resistant L5178 mouse lymphoma cells as compared with that of the positive control \u2018verapamil\u2019 (FAR = 13.14 at 23 \u00b5M) in the range of 11.2\u2013112 \u00b5M as expressed by the FAR increasing at higher concentrations (FAR = 12.29, 2.60, 2.79 at 11.2 \u00b5M and FAR = 22.92, 18.02, 29.29 at 112 \u00b5M) (Hohmann et al. 2003b). 381, 354, and 352 also displayed strong activity (FAR = 71.98\u201378.88) compared with that of the positive control \u2018verapamil\u2019 (FAR = 8.27); while 374, 382, 470, and 372 revealed weak potency. 302 and 353 had low effect on the drug accumulation at higher concentrations than at lower ones; in these cases, the increased membrane permeability could be responsible for the toxic effect that resulted in enhanced Rho123 diffusion out of the treated cells due to a membrane disintegration (Hohmann et al. 2002). The novel diterpene polyester 383 displayed considerable potency in inhibiting the efflux-pump activity of MDR P-gp in mouse lymphoma cells (FAR = 22.46 at 2 \u03bcg/mL) being even stronger than the positive control \u2018verapamil\u2019 (FAR = 8.49 at 2 \u03bcg/mL) (Hohmann et al. 2001a). Comparison of the pairs (302 and 305), (374 and 372), and (354 and 352) differing only in the lipophilicity of one of the substituents (OH, OAc, OiBu) demonstrated an increase in the MDR modifier effect. These data supported the conclusion that the effect on drug accumulation in drug-resistant cells is proportional to the hydrophobicity. Surprisingly, other structurally related pairs of compounds such as (374 and 381), with 2-OAc and 2-H and with 9-OAc and 9-ONic substitutions, respectively, and (351 and 353) differing only in the esterification at C-7-C-9 (7-OAc/7-OiBu, 8-OAc/8-OH, and 9-OAc/9-ONic) exerted very different effects in the modulation of the MDR of mouse lymphoma cells (Hohmann et al. 2002). This observation has been explained by the high flexibility of the macrocyclic ring of the jatrophane skeleton (Appendino et al. 1998).",

In another research Corea et al. isolated five new jatrophanes (pepluanins A-E (181\u2013183, 415, and 416)) together with two known analogues (355 and 443) from E. peplus (Corea et al. 2004a) and twelve new diterpenes named euphocharacins A-L (401\u2013412) from E. characias (Corea et al. 2004b). The inhibitory activity of all compounds was assayed in Pgp-mediated daunomycin transport efflux. Euphodendroidin D (420) (Corea et al. 2003a) and pepluanin A (181) (Corea et al. 2004a) together with euphocharacins C (403) and I (409) was found to be highly potent inhibitors since they were almost twofold more efficient than \u2018cyclosporin A\u2019, the golden standard of P-gp modulators. Thus, the following sequence in efficiency at C-3 may now be proposed as: propionyl > benzoyl > acetyl, isobutyryl. Another positive role was played by the benzoyl at C-9 (euphocharacin C (403), 123%) which was better than nicotinyl in euphocharacin B (402) (72%). However, they went beyond the southwestern fragment of the molecule (C-2/C-5) binding by performing SAR studies on pepluanins A-E (181\u2013183, 415, and 416) and underlined the importance of the substitution on other carbons of the medium-sized ring C-8, C-9, C14, and C-15 in modulating the activity. Observations showed this series of seven jatrophane diterpenes (pepluanins A-E, 355, and 443) highlighting the importance of an acetoxyl at C-8 (by comparison to a free hydroxyl), and of a free hydroxyl at C-15. Moreover, a carbonyl at C-14 and acetoxyl at C-9 were also favorable substitutions.",

Among all, pubescene A (270) (FAR = 79.78 in 32 \u03bcM) and D (297) (FAR = 111.00 in 32 \u03bcM) exhibited the highest effects in reversing MDR compared with the positive control \u2018verapamil\u2019. The highest lipophilicity of pubescene A (270) due to the presence of four ester groups can be suggested for its strong activity. Another important structural feature was the presence of the benzoyl group as a sterically expansive group at C-7. Moreover, the higher activity of pubescene D (297) compared with 272 was due to a different configuration of the stereocenter at C-2 bearing an \u03b1-oriented Methyl-16 (Valente et al. 2004a).",

Overall, jatrophanes indicated no ability of induction or modulation in vitro microtubule assembly or displacement of a fluorescent taxoid (Flutax-2) from its binding site, suggesting that the microtubule-stabilizing activity of these compounds, if any, arises from interactions with other factors regulating cellular microtubule polymer mass rather than by direct binding to microtubules (Buey et al. 2005).",

Their MDR-reversal effects on a human colon (COLO320) cancer cell line, as well as the synergistic capacity of these compounds, were investigated. 305, 302, and 168 were found to be very strong inhibitors (FAR > 2.00 at 40 \u03bcg/mL). For 305 the effect was almost the same at the two concentrations (FAR = 2.05 at 4 \u03bcg/mL and FAR = 2.03 at 40 \u03bcg/mL), meaning that both of the applied concentrations were in the saturation zone. 374, 470, 351, and 352 were moderately effective (0.59 < FAR < 1.7). Moreover, the synergistic capacity of these compounds in combination with \u2018epirubicin\u2019 was examined and 302 proved to be the most active, exhibiting a synergistic interaction (FIX = 0.25) with \u2018epirubicin\u2019. In contrast, 352 and 168 did not enhance the anti-proliferative effect of the anticancer drug when applied in combination with the COLO320 cell line. Comparing the efficacies of 305 and 302, it can be presumed that the presence of a hydroxy group instead of peracylation is favourable as it concerns the antiproliferative activity in combination with \u2018epirubicin\u2019 (Engi et al. 2007).",

The concentration dependence analysis indicated that 254 with IC50 value of 1.71 \u00b1 0.83 \u00b5M is twice as potent as the reference inhibitor \u2018cyclosporin A\u2019 (IC50: 3.37 \u00b1 1.39 \u00b5M).

They tested them for P-gp modulating properties on human MDR1 gene-transfected and parental L5178 mouse lymphoma cell lines. Moreover, their combinations with the cytostatic anticancer drug \u2018epirubicine\u2019 were tested in order to obtain evidence as to additive or synergistic interactions. Tuckeyanols A (143), B (144), and euphotuckeyanol (142) showed strong activity (FAR = 39.8, 25.0, and 81.0 at 4 \u03bcM, respectively) compared to \u2018verapamil\u2019 (FAR = 13.7 at 10 \u03bcM). SAR studies on euphotuckeyanol (142) with the highest activity (FAR = 81.0 at 4.0 \u03bcg/mL) showed that 142 with seven ester residues has the highest values of logP (6.7), molecular weight (818), and the highest number of hydrogen bond acceptor groups (15 H-bond acceptors), all of which considered by several authors, as important requirements to P-gp modulation (Robert and Jarry 2003; Wiese and Pajeva 2001). Based on the spatial orientation of the SP2 terminal methylene group at C-6, analouge 142 showed endo-type conformation (NOESY correlation of exo-methylen H-17 with 5-H (\u03b2)) (Jakupovic et al. 1998b, c; Marco et al. 1998) versus tuckeyanols A (143) and B (144) with exo-type conformation (Duarte et al. 2008) which may also be an important factor in MDR modulation. Concerning all these factors, it is difficult to explain which of them has the most relevant role for the high MDR-reversal activity. Duarte et al. observed that tested compounds exhibited a synergistic interaction with \u2018epirubicine\u2019 on the studied cell line (fractional inhibitory index (FIX) = 0.07\u20130.25) among which, the most effective compound was euphotuckeyanol (142), expressing a low FIX (0.07 and 0.08, respectively) in the checkerboard experiments (Duarte et al. 2008).",

(2011) investigated the inhibitory effect of two previously isolated jatrophanes from E. dendroides: euphodendrophane A (396) and euphodendrophane B (397) on the growth of the sensitive non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line (NCI-H460) and its resistant counterpart (NCI-H460/R). They further examined the potential of Euph A and B on mdr1 mRNA expression (Pe\u0161i\u0107 et al. 2011). Both jatrophanes were more efficacious at P-gp inhibition than \u2018verapamil\u2019. The development of synthetic jatrophanes based on their natural skeleton revealed that the presence of a lipophilic aromatic substituent at C-3 enhances the P-gp inhibitory activity compared to that of \u2018verapamil\u2019 (Schnabel et al. 2010). Although Euph A and B possess the smaller benzoyl residue at C-3, it does not influence their effect on P-gp inhibition which even overcomes the effect of \u2018verapamil\u2019. Earlier findings highlighted the positive role of the free hydroxyl group at C-5 and acetyl group at C-8 being present in Euph A and B (Corea et al. 2009). Both jatrophanes significantly reduced the level of mdr1 expression in (NCI-H460) sensitive cells, suggesting that they could not induce the development of resistance in spite of PTX which is a P-gp substrate. For the resistant cells, PTX decreased the expression of mdr1, while both jatrophanes did not significantly influence the expression level. Observed inhibitory effect of Euph A and B on P-gp synthesis in sensitive cell line and P-gp activity in resistant cell lines could be considered as their application as adjuvant therapy in both sensitive and resistant malignancies. Pe\u0161ic et al. had shown earlier that the resistant NCIH460/R cell line displays cross-resistance to paclitaxel, vinblastine, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and etoposide (Pesic et al. 2006) so they were interested in the investigation of the simultaneous combinations of Euph A/B and PTX on the MDR cancer cell lines. Importantly in this study, both Euph A and B enhanced the growth inhibition of PTX in a concentration-dependent manner. In this regard, all combinations used in the course of treatments of resistant NCIH460/R cells induced a strong synergistic effect. This research demonstrated that Euph A and B have the potential to reverse PTX resistance. Moreover, it was showed that the synergism between Euph A/B and PTX is partly due to their mutual effect on microtubule assembly (Pe\u0161i\u0107 et al. 2011).",

They were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against a set of human adherent cell lines of gynecological origin (HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma), Ishikawa (endometrial adenocarcinoma), and MCF-7 (breast epithelial adenocarcinoma)) using the MTT test and \u2018cisplatin\u2019 as positive control (Vasas et al. 2011). Moreover, Vasas et al. tested MDR-reversing activity of the compounds on L5178 mouse lymphoma cells, using a standard functional assay with Rho123. It was investigated that esulatins J (129), A (374), and E (504) were the most effective compounds against all cell lines; especially esulatin J (129) exhibited high cell growth inhibitory activity on Ishikawa (98.4% at 30 \u03bcg/mL) and MCF7 (81.4% at 30 \u03bcg/mL) cells. Esulatin I (128) and esulatin B (470) displayed marked inhibitory effects on MCF7 (60.1% and 43.3% at 30 \u03bcg/mL). SAR studies demonstrated that the most potent compounds, esulatins I, J, B and E (128, 129, 470, and 504) are tetra- or penta- esters of jatrophane polyols, which contain a keto group at C-9. Moreover, esulatin A (374), containing an epoxy group at C-11\u2013C-12, found also to be effective against all three cell lines. All tested compounds differed significantly in the inhibition of the efflux pump activity of P-gp in tumor cells. Within the compounds investigated, esulatin J (129) (FAR = 52.5 at 40 \u03bcg/mL) and esulatin M (134) (FAR = 119.9 at 40 \u03bcg/mL) were found to be the most powerful inhibitors of efflux pump activity. Their efficacy was 25-fold higher than that of positive control \u2018verapamil\u2019 (FAR = 23.2 at 10 \u03bcg/mL); thus, both 185 and 188 appeared to be promising leads for drug development to overcome the MDR of cancer cells (Vasas et al. 2011).",

Moreover, the synergistic effect between these jatrophanes and the \u2018paclitaxel\u2019 was reported for the first time. They also investigated the effects of 396 and 397 on Rho123 accumulation in NCI-H460/R cells and compared the results with that of untreated resistant NCI-H460/R cells by the FAR. Rho123 accumulation was about twofold higher in untreated NCI-H460 cells compared to NCI-H460/R cells. A significantly higher accumulation of Rho123 in the NCI-H460/R cell line was obtained with 396 and 397, compared to that of \u2018verapamil\u2019. This observation had been elucidated by the positive role of certain pharmacophoric elements in the activities of jatrophanes against P-gp (Corea et al. 2009), like a free hydroxy group at C-5 or an acetate group at C-8, which are both present in 396 and 397. NCI-H460/R cells were exposed to combinations of 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM of 396 and 397 with 0.05-5 \u03bcM doxorubicin and paclitaxel and sensitivity were assessed using an SRB assay. The IC50 value for paclitaxel decreased in combination with 396, demonstrating 3-, 19-, and 38-fold reversal activity for the aforementioned concentrations, respectively. An even more considerable effect was also obtained for 397, exhibiting 11-, 25-, and 60-fold reversal activity. There were no significant differences in reversal activity at concentration levels of 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM between 396 and 397 and \u2018verapamil\u2019. Both jatrophanes at 5 \u03bcM decreased the IC50 values of doxorubicin significantly, showing a similar reversal potential to \u2018verapamil\u2019. These results pointed to the potential of 396 and 397 to reverse paclitaxel and doxorubicin resistance in the MDR cancer cell line used (Aljancic et al. 2011).",

These compounds were also evaluated for their activity as apoptosis inducers using the annexinV/propidium iodide assay. 294 showed the highest P-gp modulating activity on both cell lines (FAR = 23.1 and 5.5 at 20 \u03bcM on L5178Y MDR and COLO320, respectively). But a much lower activity was observed in 295 (FAR = 1.6 and 2.8 at 20 \u03bcM) having an OH group at C-15. However, when comparing the effects of 293 (FAR = 12.1 and 5.1 at 20 \u03bcM) and 295 differing in the type of function at C-14, the presence of a carbonyl group at this position improves the activity, as for 293. The different location of one of the double bonds and the substitution at C-6 also influenced the efflux pump activity, as demonstrated by the FAR values of 293 and 302 (FAR = 10.1 and 3 at 20 \u03bcM) on the two cell lines. Contrarily, the configuration at C-2 did not seem to play a significant role in MDR modulatory activity (Valente et al. 2004a). It was concluded that the differences in the observed modulating effects between the two MDR cell lines may be associated with different levels of P-gp expression, which were lower in COLO320 cells according to immunohistological studies (Engi et al. 2006). Moreover, none of the tested compounds were able to induce significant apoptosis and cell death (Valente et al. 2012).",

However, the IC50 values for 225 differed between sensitive NCI-H460 and resistant NCI-H460/R cells (6 \u03bcM and 15 \u03bcM, respectively). Colorectal carcinoma cell lines (DLD1 and DLD1-TxR), as well as the glioma cell lines (U87 and U87-TxR), showed considerably lower sensitivity to the two jatrophanes. These results recapitulated those obtained in the previous study (Aljancic et al. 2011) and indicated the potential of Euph H (225) and Euph S (236) for NSCLC treatment. 225 significantly sensitized NCI-H460/R and DLD1-TxR cells to Paclitaxel (PTX), similar to paclitaxel, R \u00b1 verapamil (Dex-VER), and tariquidar (TQ); while 236 demonstrated the moderate chemo-sensitizing effect. These observations were in agreement with stronger anti-P-gp activity obtained with 225 in NCI-H460/R and DLD1-TxR. All tested P-gp inhibitors had similar potential for the reversion of PTX resistance. In addition, Dex-VER and TQ showed significantly lower reversal potential in U87-TxR cells as it was expected from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. In conclusion, it was confirmed that jatrophanes stimulate purified tubulin assembly in vitro by this assumption that the mutual effect of PTX and new jatrophanes on microtubule assembly leads to cycle arrest at G2/M phase and partly contributes to Euph H/S and PTX combined effects (Podolski-Reni\u0107 et al. 2013).",

(2013) (Jadranin et al. 2013). The P-gp inhibiting activities of 157\u2013169 had been assessed on previously characterized P-gp over-expressing MDR cancer cell lines: NCI-H460/R, colorectal carcinoma DLD1-TxR, and glioma U87-TxR (Pesic et al. 2006; Podolski-Reni\u0107 et al. 2011). The most promising compounds were euphodendrophane H and K (225 and 228), which completely blocked the P-gp pump and demonstrated higher activity than Dex-VER and TQ. However, the effects of 227, 222, and 236 were noteworthy as they had also achieved the complete blockage of P-gp in colorectal MDR cancer cells and exceeded the Dex-VER activity (Jadranin et al. 2013). SAR studies showed no obvious difference in the activity of jatrophanes with 6, 17 exo- (483, and 225\u2013229, 396, and 397), and those with 5, 6 endo- double bond (234\u2013237). This could be in accordance with the previous findings that said modifications in connectivity made less change in activity than the oxygenation pattern (Corea et al. 2003b). The activity was strongly affected by the OBz group at the positions C-8 and C-9 for jatrophanes with exo- and endo- double bonds, respectively. Wide range of compounds with the same exo- jatrophane skeleton (Corea et al. 2003a) emphasized the importance of free hydroxyl group at C-3 as well as substitution on C-2 and C-5. These conclusions were extended to modified jatrophanes as well (Jadranin et al. 2013).",

This finding is in agreement with previous SAR studies on jatrophane diterpenes indicating that the presence of both acylation at C-3 and hydroxylation or acylation at C-5 is detrimental for P-gp reversal activity (Corea et al. 2009) and a keto group at C-9 is rather an important feature for cytotoxicity (Vasas et al. 2011).

Potential selective antiproliferative activity of the compounds was evaluated against parental gastric (EPG85-257) and pancreatic (EPP-181) human cancer cells. Their drug-selected counterparts resistant to novantrone (RN) and to daunorubicin (RDB), was also evaluated using the SRB assay (Reis et al. 2014). MDR-selective activity was calculated through the relative resistance ratio (RR = IC50 (resistant)/IC50 (parental)). RR < 1 indicates that the compound kills MDR cells more effectively than parental cells, but if RR < 0.5, then a collateral sensitivity effect would be taking place. Anti-proliferative selectivity against the resistant gastric cell line EPG85-257RDB was shown by welwitschene (267) (IC50 = 17.2 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcM, RR = 0.6) and epoxywelwitschene (268) (IC50 = 3.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, RR = 0.1), with the latter showing a collateral sensitivity effect.

A flow cytometry-based Rho123 effluxion assay was done; the high expressions of P-gp in adriamycin resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (HepG2/ADR) and adriamycin resistant human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 (MCF-7/ADR) were first validated by Western blot. \u2018(1S,2R,3S,4S,7R,9R,13R,14R,15R)-9,15-Diacetoxy-1-tosyl-3,7-dibenzyloxy-13,14-dihydroxy jatropha-5E,11E-diene\u2019 obtained from reaction with tosyl chloride and \u2018(1S,2R,3S,4S,7R,9R,13R,14R,15R)-1,9,15-triacetoxy-3,7-dibenzoyloxy-13,14-dihydroxyjatropha-5E,11E-diene\u2019 prepared by acetylation and \u2018(1S,2S,3S,4S,7R,9R,13R,14R,15S)-9,15-fiacetoxy-3,7-dibenzoyloxy-1,13,14-trihydroxyjatropha-5E-ene\u2019 obtained by treating the solution of 222 with 10% Pd/C under H2 were all identified as potent MDR modulators with greater chemoreversal ability and less cytotoxicity than the third-generation drug \u2018tariquidar\u2019 (TQ). SAR studies showed that increasing the lipophilicity of this class of P-gp inhibitors is beneficial to MDR reversal activity; saturated ring A was essential, while the presence of free hydroxyls on C1\u2013C15\u2013C14\u2013C13 fragment had little influence on the activity. In addition, the formation of a rare C5\u2013O\u2013C13 bridge would increase the activity, while epoxidation of \u039412 is detrimental to the activity (Zhu et al. 2016).",

The cytotoxicity and anti-MDR activity of all these compounds were evaluated in a parental DOX-sensitive MCF-7 cell line and its DOX-selected derivative P-gp overexpressing MCF-7/ADR cells by the MTT method. 149 displayed significant MDR reversal activity (IC50 = 2.65 \u00b1 0.33 \u00b5M) in comparison to the other compounds with a low EC50 value (92.68 \u00b1 18.28 nM) in the MCF-7/ADR cell lines overexpressing P-gp. The remarkable advantages of 149 are its high survival potency toward normal cell line HEK293 (IC50 = 98.20 \u00b1 1.59 \u00b5M) as well as its high therapeutic index (ratio of IC50 toward HEK293 to EC50 for reversing DOX resistance = 1059.56). The results of the Western blot analysis demonstrated that the MDR reversal activity induced by 149 was not due to the inhibition of P-gp expression. The Dixon plot analysis was used to elucidate the type of inhibition. The competitive relationship between the inhibitor and substrate, gave rise to passage of the linear regression line through the origin as it was previously reported (Iseki et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2000). The regression lines of 149 and \u2018verapamil\u2019 coincide with the origin indicating that both were competitive inhibitors of P-gp-mediated DOX transport, which was in accordance with the Lineweaver\u2013Burk analysis. Besides, kinetic characterization revealed that 149 (Ki = 0.49\u20130.50 \u00b5M) possessed a high binding affinity to the DOX recognition site of P-gp with about 5.84- to 5.88-fold lower Ki values than the average Ki of \u2018verapamil\u2019. In this regard, 149 was proven to significantly inhibit DOX transport, increase intracellular DOX concentration, and finally resensitize MCF-7/ADR to DOX. They further found that fourfold more of \u2018verapamil\u2019, compared with 149, is needed to completely restore the DOX accumulation in the MCF-7/ADR cells to the level of the parental MCF-7 cells. Based on SAR study, the activity order of the ester groups at C-5 is 2-methylbutanoyloxy > benzoyloxy > propionyloxy > isobutanoyloxy. Moreover, the presence of an aromatic ester group (benzoyl) at C-14 might increase the modulation potency in comparison to a substituent group of carbonyl or acetoxyl (Hu et al. 2018).",

They focused on in vitro and in vivo investigation of MDR reversal activity of 346, as well as elucidation of its underlying mechanisms. The anti-proliferative activity of 346 on ABCB1-overexpressing cells (KBv200, MCF-7/ADR, and A549/T) and their parental cells (KB, MCF-7 and A549) were very weak at up to 30 M; therefore, the study was performed at a maximum concentration of 10 M. 346 considerably increased the sensitivity of KBv200 and MCF-7/ADR), but not their parental cells, to chemotherapeutic drugs (NVB, PTX, and DOX) which are substrates of ABCB1 at concentration as low as 0.3 M; moreover, the reversal effect of 346 was more potent than \u2018verapamil\u2019 at 10 M in both cell lines. These results indicated that 346 can increase the sensitivity of ABCB1- mediated MDR cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The reversal ability of 346 was mainly due to the inhibition of the efflux function of ABCB1 transporter; thus, it increased the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents displaying anti-proliferative effects on drug-resistant cells. The drug-efflux function of ABCB1 utilizes energy from ATP hydrolysis, so the rate of ATP hydrolysis is directly proportional to the transport activity of ABCB1. 346 stimulated ABCB1 ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner although it had no inhibitory impact on verapamil-stimulated ABCB1 ATPase activity; therefore 346 might have direct interaction with ABCB1, which may be different from \u2018verapamil\u2019. Besides, 346 had no effect on downregulating the protein level of ABCB1. These results and docking analysis together confirmed 346 induced ABCB1 malfunction may be caused by directly binding to it. These findings suggest the application of 346 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment (Fang et al. 2018).",

Their P-gp inhibitory potency was evaluated in two MDR cancer cells (NCI-H460/R and DLD1-TxR). The most potent P-gp inhibitors were 277 with FAR = 4.52 \u00b1 0.02 and 5.89 \u00b1 0.04 along with 278 with FAR = 5.02 \u00b1 0.02 and 4.39 \u00b1 0.03 in two mentioned MDR cancer cells lines. 278 also chemosensitized NCI-H460/R cells to DOX stronger than Dex-verapamil due to prolonged effect of P-gp inhibition that remained for seventy-two hours while the effectiveness of 277 was similar to Dex- verapamil. This indicated that the maintenance of the activity against P-gp for a longer period is contributed to the increased reversal potential of jatrophanes. Previous SAR study had shown that two groups of jatrophanes with exo-methylene 6,17 double bond (Jadranin et al. 2013) that lack oxygenation at C-2 and with identical structures except for the substitution at C-8, had a favorable effect on P-gp inhibition (Corea et al. 2003a) upon substitution of OBz at C-8 with ONic, OiBu or OAc. Therefore, it can be demonstrated that 277 and 278 possessing OAc and ONic at C-8 respectively, have moderate but the best potential for P-gp inhibition among tested jatrophanes from E. nicaeensis (Krsti\u0107 et al. 2018).",

The reversal fold values (RF = ratio of IC50 of adriamycin (ADR) alone to IC50 of ADR in presence of 2 or 20 \u03bcM sample) were used in evaluating the MDR reversal activity and Verapamil as a positive control. All compounds displayed favorable activities with the RF values over tenfold; over half of them (euphornoate E and euphornoate J, euphornoate K and euphornoates M-U) showed reversal ability greater than verapamil. The reversal activities significantly increased at 20 \u03bcM. The RF values of 11 compounds (euphornoates D-F, euphornoate H, euphornoates M\u2013O, euphornoate Q, euphornoate R, euphornoate T, euphornoate U) were over 100 fold even over 400 fold as the most active (euphornoate U) one, and reversal activities of all compounds were greater than the positive control. Previous SAR studies confirmed that substitutions of the \u201csouthwestern\u201d fragment (C-2, C-3, and C-5) of jatrophanes, as well as the presence of free hydroxyl at C-15 are important for the activity (Corea et al. 2003a, b). Recently, Zhu et al. (2016) have established the significance of acylation of the free hydroxyl at C-14 as it increases the activity. Therefore, it was aimed to explore different substitutions for expanded SAR studies relative to C-14. Based upon these investigations, the introduction of acyl groups bearing 4 carbons showed the most potent activities at 20 \u03bcM in alkyl acylated derivatives, for example, euphornoate D (with crotonoyl group) and euphornoate E (with isobutyryl group) exhibited RF values of 393 and 141 respectively. Overall, the MDR reversal activities were better for the aryl acylated derivatives, than the alkyl acylated derivatives at 2 \u03bcM. However, attaching electron withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring, such as nitryl and trifluoromethyl, decreased the activity (euphornoate K and euphornoate L), while electron donating groups, such as methyl and methoxyl, increased the activity (euphornoates M-Q), and the activity of ortho-substituting compound (euphornoate N) was higher than meta- and para-substituting compounds (euphornoate M and euphornoate O). Moreover, introducing of an aromatic heterocyclic ring considerably enhanced the activity, as compounds euphornoate T (2-thiophenecarbonyl group) and euphornoate U (2-furoyl group) displayed RF values of 324 and 424 fold respectively. The current SAR studies demonstrated that introduction of an alkyl acyl group bearing 4 carbons at C-14 or an aryl acyl group with electron-donating groups is desirable for the activity and several compounds with RF values over 300 fold at 20 \u03bcM (euphornoate D, euphornoate N, euphornoate R, euphornoate T, euphornoate U) were thought to be promising MDR modulators. This is in agreement with previous SAR studies confirmed the importance of acylation of free hydroxyl at C-14 as it increases the activity (Zhu et al. 2016).",

The MDR-reversing activity and cytotoxicity of the new jatrophanes were assessed in the MCF-7 cells and P-gp overexpressing MCF-7/ADR cells using the MTT method. The results demonstrated that these compounds displayed different chemoreversal activities and significantly decreased cytotoxicity. Especially, 314 with IC50 value of 5.0 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM and 315 with IC50 value of 5.2 \u00b1 2.0 \u03bcM afforded MDR reversal activities with RF (reversal fold) values of 12.9 and 12.3 at 10 \u03bcM, respectively, which was as superior as that of \u2018verapamil\u2019 (RF = 13.7, IC50 value of 4.7 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM). Because the structurally homogeneous skeletons of (307\u2013309) and (310\u2013320) are different only in the substitution pattern, performing SAR studies was possible. The presence of an isobutanoyloxy moiety at C-8 rather than at C-7 had a positive effect on the modulation of drug accumulation in the MCF-7/ADR cells by comparing the substituents and RF values of 314, 315, and 316. Furthermore, with the comparison of the biological results of 307, 309, and 311 to those of 308, 310, and 318, it was demonstrated that favorable following trend in activity at C-8 is: benzoyloxy group > H \u2248 hydroxy group (Hasan et al. 2019).",

The compounds were classified into two groups A and B. Group A (500\u2013503, 488, 359, and 493) were the esters of \u20189,14-dioxojatropha-6(17),11E-diene\u2019 and group B (367, 368, and 484, 360, 361) were those of \u20189-oxojatropha-6(17),11E-diene\u2019. The selective antiviral activity was investigated against CHIK virus with two additional members of the genus alphavirus (Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV)) and two members of the genus Lentivirus, i.e. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 viruses. Regarding the antiviral activity against alphaviruses, 502 and to a lesser extent 503 were found to be potent selective inhibitors of CHIKV replication (half = maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 0.76 \u00b1 0.14 \u03bcM, selectivity index (SI) = 208, and EC50 = 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, SI = 29, respectively). 502 also exhibited moderate anti-SINV activity, while 360, 367, and 368 showed a significant, albeit weak, antiviral activity on the replication of SINV and SFV. Concerning the activity of group A compounds, since 359 and 493 were weakly active, it could be concluded that the presence of an acetyl group at position 2 might be detrimental for anti-CHIKV activity (cf. 502 vs. 359, and 503 vs. 493). The influence of the C-8 substitution as shown by the comparison of anti-CHIKV activities of (500\u2013502 and 488, 359, 493) was the other substantial chemical feature. In this regard, the following sequence inefficiency at C-8 was proposed: tiglyloxy > benzoyloxy > acetyloxy \u2248 isobutyryloxy. Only 360 and 367 of group B showed significant anti-CHIKV activities (EC50 = 19.5 \u00b1 3.6 \u03bcM, SI = 7.8; EC50 = 21.0 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcM, SI = 2.8, respectively). These results proved that the acetyl group plays an equivalent role as an isobutyryl substituent at C-8 in the anti-CHIKV activity. Contrarily, since 368 was much less active, it was deduced that the 2-methylbutyryl group might be detrimental for this activity. In virus-cell-based assay for HIV, only 502 showed a strong selective antiviral effect on HIV-1 and HIV-2 virus replication, with IC50 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcM, SI > 96 and IC50 = 0.043 \u00b1 0.005 \u03bcM, SI > 751, respectively. 503, 488, 359, and 360 displayed moderate antiviral activity against HIV-2 (Nothias-Scaglia et al. 2014).",

Although \u2018prostratin\u2019 a non-tumorogenic phorbol ester, is a favorable lead compound to antagonize HIV-1 latency, the high concentrations required may prevent its clinical use. SJ-23b with at least one order of magnitude more potent than \u2018prostratin\u2019 internalized the HIV-1 receptors (CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5) and prevented de novo viral infection in human primary T cells at the nanomolar range. Due to their mechanisms of action, short cycles of treatment with these small molecules inducing HIV reactivation combined with HAART, could contribute to a decrease in viral reservoirs. Concerning this investigation, SJ-23b can be considered as an adjuvant therapy agent to target latent reservoirs for patients on HAART (Bedoya et al. 2009).",

These compounds were transported by CaCdr1p, as shown by observation of an 11- to 14-fold cross-resistance of yeast growth, and could also inhibit the secondary major facilitator superfamily (MFS)-transporter CaMdr1p.

            "text": "Esposito et al. (2017) isolated twenty-nine jatrophanes from E. semiperfoliata (501, 502, 367, 488, 493, 484, 360, 368, 361, and 359) and E. dendroides (28, 47, 32, 38, 421, 422, 417, 457\u2013461, 451\u2013455, and 462) five of which (451\u2013455), were new (Esposito et al. 2017). The ability of these compounds to modulate drug efflux by multidrug transporters of Candida albicans was assessed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain overexpressing either CaCdr1p or CaMdr1p. Cytotoxicity of active compounds on a C. albicans MDR strain evaluated in the second bioassay along with their ability to sensitize yeast growth through synergistic interaction with fluconazole. 462 was selective for CaCdr1p and induced a strong Nile Red (NR) accumulation (92%) through inhibition of CaCdr1p mediated efflux, whereas 367 was selective for CaMdr1p, with a 74% NR accumulation. In contrast, 28 and 418 were found to accumulate the Nile Red (NR) mediated by the two multidrug transporters, at 8\u2013-64% for CaCdr1p and 79\u201365% for CaMdr1p. The ability of the 367, 28, 462, and 418 showed potent inhibition of the MDR transporters Cdr1p and Mdr1p to sensitize yeast growth through the antifungal agent fluconazole was evaluated by the checkerboard method (White et al. 1996). Regarding these results, 367, 28, 462, and 418 displayed high fractional inhibitory index (FICI) values (\u2265 1 \u03bcM), revealing that, despite their ability to inhibit C. albicans MDR transporters expressed in yeast strains, they were not able to induce sensitization to fluconazole for C. albicans-resistant strain growth. However, some jatrophanes were found to be selective or dual inhibitors against the yeast MDR transporters CaCdr1p and CaMdr1p, but only deacetylserrulatin B and 350 obtained from E. squamosa and 295 and 293 isolated from E. mellifera were able to sensitize the C. albicans MDR strain to fluconazole (Nim et al. 2016; Rawal et al. 2014). Even with structural similarity of mentioned jatrophanes with the latter substance, none of them exhibited a similar biological activity; therefore, the ability of inhibitors to sensitize yeast growth to the antifungal activity of fluconazole is mainly dependent on the nature, number, and position of functional groups on the macrocyclic core. To apply SAR study, the chemical space of diterpenoids, was classified into A to D groups (group A: esters of \u20189,14-dioxojatropha-6(17),11E-diene\u2019 (501\u2013503, 488, 359, and 493), group B: esters of \u20189-oxojatropha-6(17),11E-diene\u2019 (360, 367, 484, and 360), group C: esters of \u201814-oxojatropha-6(17),11E-diene\u2019 (28, 47, 32, 38, 421, 422, 417, 457\u2013461, 451\u2013455, and 462), and group D: esters of \u201817-bishomojatrophane\u2019 (28\u201331)). The potency and selectivity of compounds are sensitive to the substitution pattern on the jatrophane skeleton. Hydrophobicity and an electron acceptor moiety are essential factors for the recognition of diterpenes with P-gp multidrug transporters in human cancer cell lines (Ferreira et al. 2011). But according to the results of 84.9% of the data set variance (PC1: 50.4%, PC2: 24.5%, and PC3: 10.0%) it was demonstrated that the modulation of CaMdr1p and CaCdr1p multidrug transporters in S. cerevisiae by 462, 28, 367, and 418 could not be affected by the hydrophobicity or by other chemical properties used in this PCA analysis. It was instead concluded that difference in acylation pattern between 367 with 361 and 484 from group B, appears to play an important role for a strong inhibition of the CaMdr1p multidrug transporter. An isobutyrate group at C-8 in 367, instead of an acetoxy group or hydroxy group in 360 and 484, respectively. Moreover, the comparison of 418 with 417 and 460 from group C showed that the presence of a methylbutyrate group at C-5, instead of either an isobutyrate group or a benzoate group, respectively, had a significant contribution to the inhibition of CaCdr1p activity. Besides, since 29 was much less active than 28, it was indicated that the acetoxy group at C-15 was detrimental for inhibiting drug-efflux activities of both CaCdr1p and CaMdr1p transporters. Regarding complex conformational behavior of jatrophanes depending on their esterification pattern (Esposito et al. 2016; G\u00fcnther et al. 1998), it was deduced that the modulation of CaMdr1p and CaCdr1p multidrug transporters by jatrophanes could rely on their conformational characteristics. In conclusion, 30 and 28 from group C and 417, 418, and 421 from group D were shown to be promising candidates for the development of P-gp modulators to tackle MDR human cancer cell lines. These results also demonstrated that macrocyclic diterpenoids, which are able to reverse the MDR of cancer cell lines overexpressing P-gp transporters, have not necessarily the ability of chemosensitizing C. albicans MDR strains (CaCDR1 and CaMDR1), revealing a possibly different binding mode (Esposito et al. 2017).",

These ion channels selectively expressed in the cardiac atrium are not present in the ventricle. Electrical remodeling of atrial heart muscle during chronic atrial fibrillation may result in a constitutively active form of the GIRK channel, which may indeed lead to a better understanding of the important role this channel plays in said disease. K\u00fasz et al. (2016) investigated electrophysiological effects of guyonianin G (280) and H (281), together with four jatrophanes 326, 302, 372, and 5 previously isolated from E. mongolica (R\u00e9dei et al. 2012), E. serrulata (Hohmann et al. 2002), and E. salicifolia (Hohmann et al. 2001a, b) on stable transfected HEK\u2013GIRK1/4 (Kir3.4) cell lines (K\u00fasz et al. 2016). It was demonstrated that jatrophanes could be new inhibitors with high potency for atrial GIRK channels for the first time. The most significant dose-dependent inhibitory effects on GIRK channel were displayed by guyonianin G (280) and H (281). Guyonianin G (280) had the highest blocking activity (70% at 10 \u03bcM), while the inhibition of GIRK current by guyonianin H (281) at 10 \u03bcM was 48%. 484 also inhibited the GIRK current with similar activity to guyonianin H (44% at 10 \u03bcM). Besides, this substance illustrated a quick effect occurred immediately after the application. Low blocking activity was observed in diterpenes 302 and 372 while 5 did not represent any remarkable effect (K\u00fasz et al. 2016). Selective inhibition of the GIRK channel might lead to develope a promising class of new antiarrhythmic drugs (Dobrev et al. 2005; Hashimoto et al. 2006; Kobayashi and Ikeda 2006).",

The ability of different kansuinins to activate tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) A and Trk B signaling was tested by determining the survival effects of these compounds on fibroblasts expressing Trk A and Trk B. The survival of these cells is solely dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) and BDNF (a member of the neurotrophin family related to NGF) treatment and they would normally die in the absence of NGF and BDNF. NGF had been the best candidate for its neuroprotective effects in the animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. The ability of small molecules like kansuinins which mimic or induce NGF activity was investigated for the treatment of Alzheimer. Kansuinin E (371) showed a particular effect on the survival of TrkA fibroblasts compared with TrkB cells with an ED50 value of 0.23 \u00b5g/mL. In contrast, kansuinins A (95), D (97), and F (369) enhanced the survival of both Trk A- and Trk B-expressing fibroblasts (Pan et al. 2004).",

Therefore PKC plays an outstanding role in the occurrence of thrombotic diseases. Several tumor-promoting Euphorbia diterpenes are known to act as direct activators of PKC, but many types of such diterpenes have not been studied as platelet stimulators yet. Tsai et al. (2016) studied esulatins B and I (470 and 128) previously obtained from E. esula for their effects on PKC activation and platelet stimulation. These compounds did not induce platelet aggregation at a concentration as high as 10 \u03bcM. Furthermore, these compounds which were inactive in the platelet aggregation assay failed to induce platelet secretion but the mentioned research suggests that platelets appear to be a useful model for screening PKC activators of natural origin or their chemical derivatives (Tsai et al. 2016).",

This mini-library of jatrophanes was established to screen hit or lead compounds possessing lipid-lowering activity. LDL-uptake screening assay showed that most of them improved LDL-uptake rate in HepG2 cells, with 239, 161, and 212 displaying superior effects. It was further found that these three compounds could enhance LDLR protein level in HepG2 cells dose-dependently. SAR studies demonstrated that the type of substitution at C-9 is essential for the activity, as replacing carbonyl with acetoxy group considerably increased the activity of 259 vs. 212. However, different substitutions at C-7 look to be less effective on the activity, as compounds (215\u2013217), (242, 244, 245, 106, and 337) and (208, 210, and 265) displayed similar results. 239 with a long conjugated fragment from C-5 to the carbonyl exhibited significantly increased activity. Besides, large steric hindrance between C-14 and C-15 is unpleasant for the activity, as 208, 210, and 265 displayed weak activities although they all have an acetoxy group at C-9. The presence of a carbonyl or an acetoxy group at C-14 also did not influence activity (242 vs. 331, 244 v.s 332, 245 vs. 330). Furthermore, similar activities were seen for 244 vs. 262, 245 vs. 240, 337 vs. 338, 252 vs. 260, and 241 vs. 256 demonstrating that configuration at C-2 was not important for the activity, same being true for configuration at C-13 as the results of 242 vs. 252, 106 vs. 107, 259 vs. 262 had been shown this matter. Among all, 161 showed a notable lowering effect in serum CHOL and LDL-C levels while it was less effective on HDL-C level and body weight in vivo (Li et al. 2018a).",

            "text": "Jatrophanes isolated from Euphorbia species and their polycyclic rearranged derivatives with a wide chemical structural diversity have been mentioned recently as privileged bio-resources for the development of potential drugs (Jassbi 2006; Kirby et al. 2010). Jatrophanes and modified jatrophanes have exhibited a large number of biological activities, such as being inhibitors of CaCdr1p and/or CaMdr1p efflux pumps in Candida albicans (Esposito et al. 2017), modulators of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) exhibiting reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) (Corea et al. 2003a; Hohmann et al. 2002), paclitaxel-like microtubule interacting activity (Miglietta et al. 2003), moderate cytotoxic agents against a variety of cancer cells (Hegazy et al. 2010; Lanzotti et al. 2015), and promising synergistic agents increasing the anticancer activity on resistant cells in combination with anticancer drugs (Pe\u0161i\u0107 et al. 2011). The most studied biological activity of them is the MDR reversing activity in cancer cells overexpressing P-gp. Jatropha-5,12-diene inhibitors of the drug efflux transporters ABCB1 P-gp and ABCG2 have been developed (Reis et al. 2016). SAR studies provide invaluable information on the key pharmacophoric elements of these compounds. Furthermore, they give the possibility to evaluate the efficacy of different ester groups on each position of the jatrophane macrolides requiring no costly, time-consuming labor-intensive synthesis or semisynthetic modifications. These findings coupled with conformational flexibility of twelve-membered jatrophane core have suggested that conformational flexibility is determinant for P-gp modulation, and in MDR activity, they are generally more active than the rearranged polycyclic ones (Ferreira et al. 2014; Reis et al. 2012). Besides, the hydrophobicity along with the substitutions of the \u201csouthwestern\u201d fragment (C-2, C-3, and C-5) are also critical factors for the activity of jatrophane-type diterpenes (Corea et al. 2004a). Jatrophanes exhibit also anti-inflammatory activities (Chen et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2016). They have also been reported for in vitro antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency (Bedoya et al. 2009) and Chikungunya viruses (Nothias-Scaglia et al. 2014). It had been proposed that short cycles of treatment with these small molecules inducing HIV reactivation combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), could contribute to a decrease of viral reservoirs (Bedoya et al. 2009; Nothias-Scaglia et al. 2014). Jatrophanes like pubescenol and pubescene D showed considerable antiproliferative activity against human tumor cell lines MCF-7, NCI-H460, and SF-268 (Valente et al. 2004a, c). Thus, more clinical trials and structural analysis will be required in the future to evaluate the clinical benefits of these recently discovered compounds.",
