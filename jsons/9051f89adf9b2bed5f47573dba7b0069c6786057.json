However, no study has yet determined the impact of this infection on countries with armed conflicts such as Syria, Libya and Yemen. Here in we would like to highlight the burdens of corona virus on these countries and how it could be contained. Armed conflicts have resulted a high rates of Mortality, injuries and population displacement. The highest rate of mortality was reported in the Syrian conflict (7; 1000) followed by Libya (5; 1000) and Yamen (3; 1000). Such conflicts were complicated by the destruction of health care system, lack of food and unstable daily life [2] . This was resulted in emergence of highly infectious diseases such as hemorrhagic fever, cholera and Tuberculosis [3] . The emergence of the new COVID-19 has resulted in a large number of deaths in European countries like Italy, Spain and France which considered to have heath care services with good quality an probably the best standards. Regarding the infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread, the European public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19.Thus they are facing this pandemic hardly and appealing for international help [4] .",

Corona virus have been confirmed in all countries surrounding Syria and full alert has been utilized in Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon, similarly those countries surrounding Libya, (Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia)as well as those surrounding Yemen (Oman and Saudi Arabia and even the African Horn countries and Madagascar) [5] . Therefore, concerns have been raised on the actual status of the spread of the corona virus infection in these countries and how they can be considered safe. These conflict countries are particularly prone to infectious disease such as corona virus and indeed difficult to trace and even hard to control. As many people were injured and thousands have been hold in prisons, refugees and immigrants camps without sanitation and food.",
