A high proportion of Hajj attendees are from Saudi Arabia [1]. The main health hazards for pilgrims at Hajj are respiratory infections, including influenza [2], [3], [4]. It has been reported that over 90% of pilgrims develop at least one respiratory symptom before they return to their home countries [5]. In particular, the rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza among symptomatic pilgrims was observed to range between 4% and 15% [6], [7]. Moreover, the risk of acquiring respiratory viral infections, including influenza, increased significantly after Hajj [6], the risk estimated to be eight times higher than that in community settings [8]. Besides, influenza poses substantial public health risk to the host country [9]. Therefore, the Saudi Ministry of Health has been recommending influenza vaccination for all Hajj pilgrims since 2005, particularly those at higher risk from influenza [10], [11].",

Iranian pilgrims reported satisfactory influenza vaccine uptake that generally ranged between 76% and 88% in the years between 2004 and 2010, reaching up to 100% in 2009 [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Similarly, Australian pilgrims had an acceptable vaccine uptake ranging between 65% and 89% in the years 2011 to 2013, even though pilgrims from Australia comprise less than 1% of the total Hajj pilgrims in a given year [19], [20]. The vaccination rate among Malaysian pilgrims in 2013 was reported as 65%, and the uptake among Indian pilgrims reached up to 72% in 2014 [21], [22]. On the other hand, the uptake in 2005 and 2006 ranged between 27% and 37% among French and UK pilgrims [23], [24], [25], [26]. Several studies measuring influenza vaccination rate among French pilgrims revealed vaccine uptake that fluctuated generally between 26% and 46% over the years 2006 to 2013, with extremes of up to 97% in 2009 and zero in 2013 (due to unavailability of vaccine before Hajj) [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. A large study among Egyptian pilgrims (who represent about 4% of the total pilgrims) revealed low influenza vaccination rates of between 9% and 30% in the years 2012 to 2015 [32].",

            "text": "However, there are limited data on influenza vaccine uptake among Saudi Hajj pilgrims. Two studies assessed vaccine uptake before 2005, reporting rates of 1% and 11% in 2003 [33], [34]. Two further studies examined the uptake in 2006 and 2009, reporting rates of 4% and 13.7%, respectively [25], [35]. Thus, the available data from studies conducted before or around the pandemic year reveal that influenza vaccine uptake among Saudi pilgrims in the past has been lower than the average of other countries. In addition, the rate has not been assessed since the pandemic, while the need for influenza vaccination for Hajj pilgrims has been discussed recently [36], [37], [38], [39]. Considering that between 26% and 45% of pilgrims in the last 10 years have been from Saudi Arabia [1], it is crucial to evaluate influenza vaccine uptake among these domestic pilgrims. Therefore, this analysis is aimed to assess influenza vaccine uptake among Saudi Hajj pilgrims over three consecutive years and to identify the key factors affecting vaccine uptake.",

The Hajj tour group leaders, who were responsible for catering Saudi or Australian pilgrims were approached and invited to take part in the study. In the consenting groups pilgrims were met by the research team members in their tents on the first day of Hajj in respective years (October 13th in 2013, October 2nd in 2014 and September 22nd in 2015) in Mina tent city, Greater Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Only data from domestic Hajj pilgrims, who performed Hajj from Saudi Arabia, regardless of their nationalities, were included in this analysis. All participating pilgrims who gave consent were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire on the first day of Hajj. The questionnaire included participants\u2019 demographic data such as gender, age, address and occupation; their medical histories including pre-existing medical conditions and pregnancy status; and their vaccination history including the receipt of influenza, and the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine if unvaccinated.",

Notable non-Hajj outbreaks such as SARS in 2003-04 and avian influenza (H5N1) in 2005-06 contributed to a relative increase in influenza vaccination uptake in several settings [46], [47], [48], [49]. Similarly, the highest influenza vaccine uptake among Hajj pilgrims from different countries was observed in 2009 during the global outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm 2009 strain [14], [15], [27]. This might be influenced by a heightened awareness and prolific publicity in the media, and its resultant change in policy which made the vaccine as one of the visa requirements for Hajj attendance. The surges of the MERS-CoV epidemic in Saudi Arabia in 2013 and 2014 were followed by enhanced recommendations by Saudi health authorities for influenza vaccination [50]. These policies could have played a role in the improving influenza vaccination rate among Saudi pilgrims seen in this study. However, precise data to explore the motivators of influenza vaccination in the current analysis are insufficient. Additionally, the lower number of participants in 2013 compared to the subsequent two years might have skewed the data bringing the representativeness of data into question.",

Individuals with these high-risk conditions, including Hajj pilgrims before their travel, are recommended to receive seasonal influenza vaccine annually [10], [11], [41]. The current study shows that the pilgrims \u2018at increased risk\u2019 had slightly higher vaccination rate than the other pilgrims. This has also been observed in several other studies. For example, Australian pilgrims and GCC residents who were \u2018at increased risk\u2019 had higher vaccination uptake than \u2018not at increased risk\u2019 participants [19], [26], [51]. Even though vaccination uptake among \u2018at increased risk\u2019 pilgrims is relatively higher than among other pilgrims, vaccination rate has not reached the benchmark set by the WHO. Moreover, in this study, pregnant pilgrims, who are particularly encouraged to receive influenza vaccine before Hajj, had an overall vaccination uptake of just 39%. Similarly, low uptake among non-pilgrim Saudi pregnant women was attributed to misunderstanding about the safety of influenza vaccine for pregnant women [52]. Furthermore, in a hospital based study in Saudi Arabia, it was observed that only 8.8% of HCWs knew that influenza vaccine is recommended for pregnant women [53]. Thus, efforts should be inspired to promote influenza vaccination among both Saudi pilgrims and HCWs to enhance vaccine coverage among pregnant and \u2018not at increased risk\u2019.",

Believing that one can rely on natural immunity was a common misperception about influenza among the Hajj pilgrims in this study. This was also the main reason for not receiving the vaccine among Australian pilgrims in 2011 and 2012 [19]. Furthermore, some pilgrims claimed that they rarely get influenza or underestimated the seriousness of influenza. Likewise, in another study, up to 14% of pilgrims who did not receive the vaccine claimed that they were not worried about getting influenza during Hajj [54]. Concerns about vaccine effectiveness or fear of vaccine side effects were stated by Saudi Hajj pilgrims as reasons for non-vaccination before Hajj. HCWs in Saudi Arabia (in non-Hajj settings) stated that they did not receive the vaccine because they believed the vaccine was not effective (51%) [53]. Other studies show that general Hajj pilgrims had similar misperceptions [45], [54], [55].",

For example, the uptake of influenza vaccine increased twice among pilgrims who received health education before Hajj compared to those who did not [55]. Overcoming the lack of awareness and misperceptions about the influenza vaccine among pilgrims, dissemination of accurate information is needed through communication channels that pilgrims use and trust. For instance, the recommendation of Hajj tour group leaders was the main positive influence on pilgrims\u2019 attitudes towards preventive measures and vaccination among Australian pilgrims [19]. Data from a large survey on vaccination uptake among residents of GCC countries including Saudi Arabia (though not necessarily Hajj pilgrims) revealed that doctor\u2019s advice was the leading motivator for receipt of influenza vaccine [45]. Vaccine advocacy through doctors, health authorities, and Hajj tour group leaders could enhance pilgrims\u2019 vaccine uptake.",
