For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model -the \"Rippled Newsvendor\" -with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and \"wear-and-tear\" (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways. Our simulations indicate that local exogenous risk is of greater importance than non-local exogenous risk. Furthermore, we show that the type of risk, as well as the structural characteristics of the supply chain and inventory system, impact risk severity differently. (S.

The idea is that every individual has a collection of observations and concepts often referred to as knowledge. This knowledge, often represented as , represents all the beliefs that one has about the world surrounding them, and is often referred to as a priori knowledge, or prior belief (Heckerman, 1998) . This is commonly modeled with the use of conditional probability. Conditional probability transcends the concept of belief updating. For example, if represents the amount of income we will earn next year, then an individual initially holds a belief that will be equal to with a value of belief ( = | ).

If inventory is disrupted ( 1 = 1), then we can only use production to satisfy demand so as to prevent a disruption since all inventory is assumed to be wiped out.

Finally, if both inventory and production are disrupted, then there is no product to deliver to the consumer, and hence we must have a disruption. Thus, we have ( = 1| 1 = 0, 1 = 1, 1 = 1) = 1. By similar reasoning presented previously, when both inventory and production are disrupted, it does not matter if there is an exogenous event, since we already will know, in this instance, that there will be a disruption. Hence, we also will have ( = 1| 1 = 1, 1 = 1, 1 = 1) = 1. Now if we do have an exogenous event occur ( 1 = 1), then the chances of our demand fulfillment being satisfied could be attributable to either the exogenous event or the event that occurs with production and inventory. If there is only an exogenous event, but there is no disruption to inventory or production, we need to specify the probability of a disruption at demand fulfillment, which we denote as . We assume this is the same for all firms in the chain for all of their exogenous events. If we have inventory disrupted ( 1 = 1), then the probability of this impacting the demand is based on either the exogenous event impacting all of the demand, or, it does not impact demand but there is insufficient production to satisfy demand. Put differently, the demand cannot be fulfilled if the exogenous event ''trickled down'' to the demand fulfillment, or if > 1 . For the sake of parsimony, we assume these two events are independent (the exogenous event does not impact the ability to satisfy demand with production if production is not disrupted, and likewise, the ability to satisfy demand with production does not impact an exogenous event).

Overall, however, the biggest take-away from our plots is the convex nature of the objective function, which may indicate that optimal solutions do exist for our model, and reflect the trade-off between producing too little or too much so as to minimize severity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 305, "text": "(Schmitt et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Turning to our second experiment, we can see that the probability of a disruption at inventory/production due to an exogenous event ( ), as well as probability of the manifestation of an exogenous event due to the manifestation of the supplier's exogenous event ( , ), impact the severity in a linear manner, ceteris paribus. From Fig. 3(a) we can see that the probability of a manifestation of an exogenous event at a firm's location conditional on no manifestation of an exogenous event at the firm's supplier's location ( ( = 1| +1 = 0)) has a much greater impact on the risk severity than the other sources of exogenous risk.

This observation underscores the importance to distinguish between firm performance and risk severity as well as how risk propagation impacts both. While others in the literature have suggested that there is a greater impact to firm performance due to endogenous risks when compared to exogenous risks (DuHadway and Carnovale, 2019), our results indicate that there is no such difference in magnitude to severity. Rather, there is a distinction of magnitude of impact based on whether the risk had manifested within a firm's boundaries (yet, the risk itself still being considered as ''exogenous'') or from outside. Our results indicate that severity is greater when risk emanates within the firm's boundaries rather than from outside. Hence, our results can be considered as an extension of the extant literature with respect to the consequences of endogenous/exogenous risk and disruption. From Fig. 3(b) , we observe that as the number of firms increase, ceteris paribus, the severity decreases. This result is congruent with the extant literature which suggests that the complexity of the supply network structure is related to the level of severity (Schmitt et al., 2017) . We further emphasize the reasoning for this with two primary explanations with respect to our study. First, the structure of the supply chain is itself linear, and so the number of ''paths'' for risk to ''flow'' is greatly reduced in our risk graph than if we were to have a more complex network. Second, all of our parameters remained fixed, and the probabilities of disruption were fairly low. However, if this result holds in general, we can conclude that firms may want to seek more linear structures (single suppliers), as this would naturally help reduce the number of events that could occur.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1312, "end": 1334, "text": "(Schmitt et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 39, "end": 48, "text": "Fig. 3(d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1064, "text": "Fig. 3(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We therefore have further illustrated that an ''unplanned event that disrupts a complex supply chain would be more likely to be severe than the same supply chain disruption occurring within a relatively less complex supply chain'' (Craighead et al., 2007, pg. 141) .

With risk propagation, we have confirmed the findings of other studies that suggest simpler structures lead to decreased risk propagation (Craighead et al., 2007; Schmitt et al., 2017) .

Since the average demand is higher, we will need to either produce more, or, hold more in inventory.

With respect to the probabilities of disruption, we can see that the probability of the manifestation of an exogenous event at a firm when no exogenous event has manifested at the firm's supplier is the most sensitive of our parameters. This is in line with our earlier observation of this probability having the most impact on the optimal severity in the network. Furthermore, we can observe that the probability of the manifestation of an exogenous event at a firm when an exogenous event has manifested at the firm's supplier is the least sensitive of the parameters in our model.

Our model can be considered an extension of this idea. More appropriately, the Rippled Newsvendor can be viewed as the precursor to various ripple effects, and how the presence of various risks eventually lead to the disruption propagation itself.

Our findings lead us to three major contributions of note. First, we designed a model that radically reshapes the traditional newsvendor model. While cost and profit are always objectives of concern, today's modern supply chains have led supply chain managers to redirect their attention to supply chain disruption, risk propagation, and severity (Craighead et al., 2007; Ivanov et al., 2017a; Hosseini et al., 2019b) . As far as we are aware, this is the first major study to clarify and measure the construct of risk severity through the lens of risk propagation and the ripple effect. We further argue, given our construction, that risk severity is more of a risk propagation construct than it is a risk or disruption construct.

At a general level, our findings lead to a better understanding of how not only inventory and production policies should be structured when the objective is severity-based, but also which portions of the supply network (with respect to disruption risk) should be given the most attention and mitigation efforts. Additionally, managers need to have the appropriate management of exogenous events. This of course has been emphasized in the prior literature through proper risk management methodologies, namely that of identification, assessment, and mitigation (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005) , or the detection, mitigation, recovery viewpoint (DuHadway et al., 2019; DuHadway and Carnovale, 2019). Our results, however, indicate that managers should focus more of their attention on control or mitigation of exogenous events that directly impact their own firm, and spend less of an effort and resources on mitigating the propagation of exogenous risk from a supplier to an exogenous risk of the firm itself.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 681, "end": 709, "text": "(Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Managerial implications"}, {"text": "Furthermore, our results indicate that firms should emphasize strict reliability policy of their machines and inventory systems, and to further ensure that these policies are in line with their market demand. Last, if the firm is in a linear structure (which we contend is not a very realistic assumption), they should aim to contract with suppliers that have longer chains. This may seem counter intuitive, since longer chains may expose the firm to more susceptibility of risk. However, our results indicate that when the firm has a single supplier, and suppliers subsequent to them also have single suppliers, when the chain is longer, the average severity is lower. The reasoning behind this observation is simple. Chains can stop disruptions in their path due to the simplicity of the structure, while networks allow for other paths for the disruption to propagate (Kim et al., 2011) . If the supply chain structure is a pure linear structure, and one of the firms exposed to the risk managed to mitigate it, it is less likely for the disruption to continue downstream. The only other way in which a disruption can occur in a firm lower than the firm that mitigated the disruption would be due to (1) pure coincidence or (2) due to some unknown path of causality, as we argued above.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 870, "end": 888, "text": "(Kim et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Managerial implications"}, {"text": "While our research has made great strides, it is not without it's limitations. First, we only studied a simple chain structure. Future research is needed to understand how multiple suppliers, as well as how general network structure, will impact optimal decision making with respect to minimizing risk severity. Second, while we focused on risk severity, we did not include any profit or budgetary constraints. Future research will need to re-examine our model from either a constrained budget lens, or, a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, we assume that all firms have the same inventory levels with varying production levels. While this was an initial consideration, we decided that varying both the inventory levels and production levels across all firms would add unnecessary complexity and would be outside the scope of this study. Future research should examine this limitation. Furthermore, we assumed that the probabilities of exogenous events were all the same across all firms. This of course is a threat to the external validity of our results. Future research will need to better understand how the Rippled Newsvendor is to respond when the probabilities of exogenous events differ across firms. Last, our model only was studied from a singleperiod perspective.

Even if we were to remain in the severity framework of study, another important consideration to take into account is the manager's risk preference and response (DuHadway et al., 2018) . Some events that manifest may not be as grave of a concern as others. Furthermore, our study only relies on measures of averages without taking into account variation. While the optimal policies characterized herein portend great concern over certain parameters, how would this change when the manager has the competing objective to minimize the variance of the number of events?
