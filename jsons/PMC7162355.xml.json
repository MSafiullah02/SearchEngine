The significance of raised inflammatory markers in those with tonsillitis is debatable, but there is some evidence that their increase is linked to a higher likelihood of streptococcal infection requiring antibiotics.7 An area of particular controversy regarding blood testing surrounds investigation of infectious mononucleosis (IM). Those with IM are increasingly likely to require hospitalisation, have worsening symptoms and suffer from respiratory distress and/or splenic/hepatic complications (including haemorrhage). Monospot testing is routinely undertaken in hospital practice, but results can be misleading, with current commercially available. Monospot tests quoted to be 70\u201392% sensitive and 96\u2013100% specific.8 The gold standard investigation is Epstein\u2013Barr virus serology, but this test is significantly more expensive and is probably unnecessary in the majority of cases.8 IM is a clinical diagnosis with laboratory investigations used to confirm the diagnosis.2 Evidence within the literature9 suggests that the lymphocyte count alone or when used in combination with the total white cell count could be used as a quick screening test prior to monospot or serological testing (level 3/4 evidence). However, it is reported that in the paediatric population or those with strong clinical signs of IM, these methods may be more unreliable.",

Although teasing out the exact effect of using the combination of an intravenous antibiotic with steroid will be difficult, what is clear is in the population of patients presenting with inability to swallow with systemic features, the use of an intravenous antibiotic initially and then converting to oral therapy later is likely to be sound clinical practice (level 5 evidence).\nKeypoints\nOnce patients have made it to the secondary care setting, antibiotic therapy will be necessary in the majority of cases.Penicillin is considered best as a first\u2010line treatment in those with suspected bacterial infection.Patients presenting with inability to swallow and systemic features should be commenced on intravenous antibiotics, with conversion to oral when able to tolerate.\n\n",
