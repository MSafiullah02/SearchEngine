            "text": "Protein aggregation is ubiquitous and results in different outcomes depending on the nature of the interactions between the proteins. Through cyclization and dimerization of the same protein, as well through combination with another protein, aggregation leads to a finite number of predicted topologies of protein complexes in quarternary structure space [1]. 14 of these topologies are observed in the protein data bank [2]. Aggregation may generate amorphous clusters during in vitro misfolding if there is no protection provided by chaperons [3], but it may also produce quasispherical hollow shells as in the case of apoferritin [4]. In addition, it may lead to formation of fibrous structures, such as amyloid fibers [5\u20138] or polymers made of sickle cell hemoglobins [9]. Finally, a spontaneous protein aggregation around a nucleic acid [10] creates compact virus capsids. The key mechanism for co-assembly of capsid proteins and RNA is provided by non-specific electrostatic interactions between RNA phosphate groups and positively charged residues, often located in flexible tails known as arginine rich motifs [11]. There is evidence that there are specific packaging sites on RNA that additionally affect the process [12]. It should be noted, however, that virus capsids can form (in vitro) without any nucleic acid as a result of manipulation of the pH of the solvent [13].",

Here, we propose an approach in which the fully assembled system is dissociated in a controlled manner by heating and then cooled back to the room temperature in an attempt to restore the original structure. Clearly, too much heating will disperse the components too much for them to reassembly within acceptable computational times. Thus there is a threshold bellow which the self-assembly still takes place, perhaps not fully, and, in this regime, one can study the reassembly pathways in a meaningful manner. In this paper, we explore this problem in the context of virus capsids.",

Here, we consider self-assembly of icosahedral virus capsids from proteins that are described by a coarse-grained structure-based model. This kind of the protein-based representation of the capsids has been used previously to study nanoindentation of the capsids that have been already formed [14, 15]. We focus on two viruses: SPMV (satellite panicum mosaic virus) [16] and CCMV (cowpea chlorotic mottle virus) [17, 18]. CCMV is one of the best studied viruses [19]. It contains RNA and 180 identical protein subunits. The subunits are arranged into 12 pentamers and 20 hexamers, known collectively as capsomers. This virus corresponds to the triangulation number, T, of 3 [20, 21]. It is made of 34 200 residues out of which 5 580 belong to disordered tails. SPMV is one of the smallest capsids and its symmetry corresponds to \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}T=1 [22].

An equilibrium Landau-type theory [23] suggests that the icosahedral state is in close competition with states that have tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries which may confound assembly. There is experimental evidence that in the case of CCMV the proteins tend to first form dimers and the capsomers arise by aggregation of the dimers [24]. However, HK97 seems to form heksamers and pentamers in one step [25]. Other experimental insights into the assembly process are scarce which calls for a thorough analysis of the process through modelling.",

Interactions between the apex points are repulsive and those between the base points are described by the Morse potential. The authors demonstrate existence of kinetic traps and a hysteretic behavior. A more detailed model has been considered by Elrad and Hagan [29, 30]. It involves truncated-pyramidal shapes constructed out of rigid polymers (see also [31\u201333]) that minimize their interaction energy in a perfect \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}T=1 icosahedron.

However, the large number of the degrees of freedom involved has allowed only for short-time assessment of the fluctuational dynamics around the native, fully assembled conformation. Thus self-assembly, necessarily involving conformational changes of the proteins, needs to be described in terms of a flexible coarse-grained model. Here, we consider self-assembly of such proteins. They evolve according to the Newton\u2019s equations of motion whereas the rigid supramolecular objects, considered in the previous theoretical approaches, usually undergo purely stochastic displacements (though a Newtonian approach has been proposed in [38]). Each effective atom in our model represents an amino acid residue and the contact interactions between them are of the Lennard-Jones kind. The presence of the interactions is determined through atomic-level considerations whereas in the models with the supramolecular solid objects, the intra-object interactions are engineered.",

The more detailed description of the model necessitates making simplifications in the physical setup. Instead of having a system of diffusing stiff capsomers that would allow for formation of tens of capsids, we just consider a single capsid. We separate the capsid into its proteins by an application of heating and then study the kinetics of self-assembly by restoring the room temperature. We study empty capsids and capsids with the polymeric RNA.",

It is the individual proteins that appear to be the agents of the process. The presence of the RNA molecule is observed to destabilize the capsid in a slight way, but not to affect aggregation in a significant way. The outcome of self-assembly is controlled by the unfolding temperature, the length of time during which unfolding is induced, and the waiting time as measured from the instant at which the room temperature is restored. Substantial thermal unfolding leads to only a partial reconstruction of the capsid in the cooling stage. We expect, however, that applying our procedure to many capsids, instead of just one, especially under the conditions of confinement, would improve the quality of self-assembly because a protein that separates from its original capsid through diffusion is likely to contribute to construction of another capsid elsewhere.",

We use the overlap criterion (for a fuller discussion of possible contact maps see [48]) to determine the existence of a native contact between two residues. The contact is considered to be present if there is at least one pair of heavy atoms whose enlarged van der Waals spheres overlap. The radii of the spheres are taken from [49] and then they are multiplied by 1.24 to account for attraction [50]. This factor corresponds to the inflection point in the Lennard-Jones potential. This leads to 71 520 native contacts in CCMV and 25 980 in SPMV. They split into intra- and inter-protein contacts. There are 19 740 intra- and 6240 inter-protein contacts in SPMV. In CCMV, the corresponding numbers are 54 600 and 16 920. In both cases, the number of the intra-protein contacts is about three times larger than the number of contacts between the proteins. Any conformation of the system of aggregating proteins can be characterized by the fraction of the established contacts relative to the native numbers of the contacts.

When generating such walks, we attempt to select an orientation of each next bond by choosing random Euler angles up to 10 000 times until a non-overlapping conformation is found. A failure results in repeating the construction anew. Such structures need to be equilibrated at Tr. We find that the equilibration lasting for 1000 \u03c4 is sufficient. For a meaningful comparison, we also equilibrate the empty structures in the similar way. Examples of the derived structures are shown in figure 1.

This is the specific heat normalized to its maximal value. The maximum in the specific heat is located at temperature Tmax, the values of which are listed in table 1. Around Tmax there is a transition between the quasispherical shape and disordered arrangements. Tmax is observed to be lower for CCMV than for SPMV. The difference is about 10% both for capsids with the RNA and without. The presence of the RNA is seen to lead to a lowering of Tmax. This happens because the moving RNA molecule keeps striking the capsid shell which contributes to its destabilization. The maxima in C get broader when the RNA is included.

It should be noted, however, that the multiple-capsid problem involves conceptual issues when considered within the structure-based model. These issues are not solved yet. For a single globular protein, the native structure defines a unique contact map (for a given scheme of selecting the contacts).
