Incidence and pathogenicity of influenza-bacterial coinfections are multifactorial processes that involve various pathogenic virulence factors and host responses with distinct site-and strain-specific differences. Animal models and kinetic models have improved our understanding of how influenza viruses interact with their bacterial co-pathogens and the accompanying immune responses. Data from these models indicate that considerable alterations in epithelial surfaces and aberrant immune responses lead to severe inflammation, a key driver of bacterial acquisition and infection severity following influenza. However, further experimental and analytical studies are essential to determining the full mechanistic spectrum of different viral and bacterial strains and species and to finding new ways to prevent and treat influenza-associated bacterial coinfections. Here, we review recent advances regarding transmission and disease potential of influenza-associated bacterial infections and discuss the current gaps in knowledge.",

Multiple respiratory viruses and bacteria can cause an infection that leads to severe pneumonia, and it is now recognized that a high proportion of community-acquired pneumonia is caused by coinfections. Pathogens including influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococcus (S. pyogenes, or GAS), and others, alone or in various combinations, cause millions of ambulatory care visits for pneumonia and thousands of deaths each year in the United States. The resulting economic burden is greater than 17 billion dollars (File and Marrie 2010) . In addition, otitis media is the leading reason for visits to a pediatrician (2.4 million visits per year) (Centers for Disease Control Deaths and Mortality, Centers for Disease Control Estimated Burden of Acute Otits Externa)], further increasing the health care cost of these pathogens. Although otitis media has classically been considered a bacterial disease, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that viral infections are a common cause and a great deal of acute otitis media (AOM) results from coinfections with two or more pathogens (Heikkinen 2000) .",

            "text": "Of the multiple viruses and bacteria that participate in coinfections of the lung and middle ear, one of the most important is the influenza virus. Although influenza is a major public health threat on its own, bacterial coinfections complicating influenza contribute greatly by exacerbating disease severity. Detailed descriptions of fatal cases date as far back as the eighteenth century (Laennec 1923) indicating that viral-bacterial coinfections have been recognized as being prevalent for hundreds of years. Since then, further study has taken place. The most infamous event was during the ''Spanish Flu '' pandemic in 1918-1919 where more than 95 % of the 50+ million deaths were complicated by a bacterial coinfection (Morens et al. 2008) . Although significant improvements regarding health care have been made, new pathogenic strains emerge and complications from bacterial coinfections continue. Approximately 50-70 % of severe or fatal cases in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemics and nearly one-third of those in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic had bacterial complications (Louria et al. 1959; Weinberger et al. 2011) . Furthermore, when a bacterial coinfection was identified, mortality was high despite appropriate antibiotic use in the majority of cases (Dom\u00ednguez-Cherit 2009; Kumar 2009; Jain et al. 2009; Palacios et al. 2009 ). Today, it is well recognized that bacterial pneumonia complicates disease initiated by respiratory pathogens like influenza viruses.",

However, over the last decade, S. aureus dominated influenza-associated childhood fatalities in the US and accounted for *75 % of deaths from bacterial coinfections. S. aureus has likely become a more common cause of fulminant coinfections due to the emergence in some countries of the methicillin-resistant clonotypes USA300 and USA400 (MRSA). It is unclear why these strains are more likely lead to secondary pneumonia with influenza than other circulating strains. There is currently no vaccine for S. aureus. Group A streptococcus only occasionally complicates viral infections (Chaussee et al. 2011 ) and, when present, falls behind pneumococcus and S. aureus in prevalence.",

In the initial model, sublethal doses of PR8 and of a type 2 laboratory strain of pneumococcus (D39) reproducibly caused severe secondary bacterial pneumonia when given intranasally in BALB/c mice (McCullers and Rehg 2002) . The influenza virus infection had to precede the bacterial challenge to observe synergistic disease.

Several different animal models have been used to study the effect that influenza viruses have on bacterial transmission and colonization and on invasive diseases, such as acute otitis media and pneumonia (Wherry and Butterfield 1921; Shope 1931; Francis and de Torregrosa 1945; Berendt et al. 1975; Rarey et al. 1987; Hajek et al. 1999; Hirano et al. 1999; McCullers and Rehg 2002; Okamoto et al. 2003; Seki et al. 2004; Peltola et al. 2006; Montgomery et al. 2008; Small et al. 2010; Diavatopoulos et al. 2010b; Lee et al. 2010; Jamieson et al. 2010; McCullers et al. 2010; Loving et al. 2010; Iverson et al. 2011; Kudva et al. 2011; Ayala et al. 2011; Chaussee et al. 2011; Short et al. 2011; Mina et al. 2013; McHugh et al. 2013; Redford et al. 2014) with the organisms resulted in the most severe disease, and peak severity occurred when pneumococcus was given 7 days postviral infection. Simultaneous administration of the two pathogens had only additive effects on morbidity, rather than the synergistic effects observed during the sequential infection. This model was later improved by engineering pneumococcal strains to express luciferase, which allows for quantitative bioluminescent imaging to track progression of the infection in live mice (McCullers and Bartmess 2003) .",

For example, viruses that replicate well in mice are required to produce robust and reproducible effects, a limitation that affects the certainty with which conclusions can be extrapolated to humans. This is mitigated somewhat by using different species of mice, including the C57BL/6 strain, which behaves similarly to the BALB/c strain (Karlstrom et al. 2011) , and the DBA/2 strain, which is highly permissive to a variety of human influenza strains (Alymova et al. 2011 ). In addition, a ferret model can be used to confirm results found using the mouse model or to answer questions about strain-related differences in pathogenesis since ferrets are susceptible to most human viruses and exhibit a disease course similar to humans (Peltola et al. 2006; McCullers et al. 2010) .",

There are limited data with other viruses and bacteria in the ferret model, but unpublished experience from our laboratory has shown that S. aureus will not cause respiratory infections in ferrets even when the animals are preinfected with influenza. Another limitation of the mouse model is the poor transmission potential for respiratory viruses or bacteria between mice, thus requiring the use of alternate models such as neonatal mice (Diavatopoulos et al. 2010a) Early animal models of AOM utilized the chinchilla due to their large and accessible middle ear spaces (Hajek et al. 1999) . These studies demonstrated that the greatest incidence of AOM occurred in animals receiving bacteria 4-8 days following influenza (Hajek et al. 1999) , similar to the data concerning timing of pneumonia. More recently, juvenile and infant mouse models have been developed so that diseases of young adults and children, respectively, can be mimicked (McCullers et al. 2007; Diavatopoulos et al. 2010a) . Similar models are used to investigate the effects that influenza viruses have on bacterial colonization (Tong et al. 2001; Nakamura et al. 2011) .",

While influenza viruses can spread by large droplets up to six feet away, pneumococcal transmission is thought to require close contact of individuals. Recent evidence, however, suggests that this distance can be lengthened if the individual is virus infected. In fact, epidemiological studies found connections between upper respiratory tract (URT) infections, likely of viral origin, and an increase in bacterial transmission and carriage prevalence (Gwaltney et al. 1975; Garc\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez and Fresnadillo Mart\u00ednez 2002; Pettigrew et al. 2008; Murphy et al. 2009; Ansaldi et al. 2012) . Influenza virus' impact on pneumococcal transmission was recently illustrated in the ferret model where transmission events and recipient acquisition increased while the distance necessary for successful bacterial acquisition decreased ). Both bacterial titers and disease severity intensified in the contact ferrets. This relationship was further examined in the infant mouse model, where influenza virus replication and nasopharyngeal bacterial growth were deemed essential for pneumococcal transmission between littermates (Diavatopoulos et al. 2010b; Short et al. 2012b ).",

Airway damage from overexuberant inflammatory responses and disruption of specific immune responses to viral pathogens leave the airways suitable for invasion by bacterial pathogens (reviewed in Short et al. 2012a; Bosch et al. 2013; Metzger and Sun 2013; McCullers 2014) . The host depends on the mucociliary apparatus in the lung and nasal passages to clear invading pathogens, but viral insults can damage the respiratory epithelium and inhibit this mode of removal (Pittet et al. 2010) . Receptors [e.g., plateactivating factor receptor (PAFr) (Cundell et al. 1995; Miller et al. 2007 )] permissive to attachment of bacterial invaders become exposed in these inflamed areas, as shown by autopsy studies in humans and in vivo infections in mice (Giles and Shuttleworth 1957; Oseasohn et al. 1959; Herzog et al. 1959; Plotkowski et al. 1986 Plotkowski et al. , 1993 Louie et al. 2009 ). Additional adhesion sites in the lung appear as the viral lesions begin to heal. Pneumococcus, H. influenzae, and S. aureus, in particular, all use bacterial adhesions to bind exposed laminin, type I and IV collagen, and fibrin/fibrinogen deposition in areas of incomplete healing (Fainstein et al. 1980 ). Injured or differentiating cells also provide new sites on apical receptors [e.g., asialylated glycans or integrins) for both S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (reviewed in Puchelle et al. 2006) .",

Numerous alterations of the respiratory epithelium and host immune responses occur during influenza virus infection that predisposes a host to coinfection with bacterial pathogens. As influenza virus infects and kills host cells, epithelial surfaces become exposed and permissive to bacterial attachment. Physical barriers (e.g., mucociliary transport) are damaged, pathogen detection is decreased, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are downregulated, receptors are upregulated, virus production is enhanced, bacterial transepithelial migration is permitted, and repair mechanisms are lost. Several host responses are also dampened, altered, or removed. Alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and NK cells have altered cytokine profiles and become impaired and/or depleted. These changes result in a heightened inflammatory environment with decreased bacterial surveillance and eradication are disrupted. Some bacteria, like pneumococcus, use their own NAs to access receptors and cleave sialic acids to avoid host defenses and prevent mucociliary clearance, replacing, or complementing antecedent viral infections (Camara et al. 1991) .",

In this state, bacteria exist in either biofilms or move between intracellular and extracellular states. Most often, colonizing strains remain in the upper airways since movement to the lower respiratory tract is inhibited by physical barriers (e.g., mucociliary mechanisms) and by immune responses (e.g., resident immune cells, complement, and mucosal antibodies). In this manner, the breakdown of physical barriers and disruption of host responses can result in bacteria emerging from biofilms (Marks et al. 2013) .",

This is likely due to colonizing strains being limited by systemic immunity, such as pathogen-specific serum IgG, which prevents successful invasion of the lower airways but may tolerate carriage [reviewed in (McCullers et al. 2010) ]. In the mouse model, bacteria are delivered directly to the lung, which mimics a direct-inhalation scenario. It is unclear whether this scenario is physiologically relevant in humans, or whether some period of colonization of the nasopharynx must occur prior to invasion and dissemination [reviewed in (McCullers 2014) ]. The inoculum size and volume, and the length of anesthesia all influence how much bacteria reach the lower airways and thus the disease model being studied. Both the ferret and mouse AOM models, on the other hand, use colonization as a prerequisite for pneumonia or AOM, so a more natural infection for this site can be instigated.",

This may be mediated by type I interferon responses and bacterial toxins, such as pneumococcal pneumolysin (Nakamura et al. 2011) . Nasopharyngeal colonization can result in bacterial migration to the middle ear via the Eustachian tube. In mice AOM models, animals become colonized with pneumococcus within 72 h after inoculation and can experience recurrent episodes when virus infected (McCullers et al. 2007 ). Of those that developed AOM (*70 %), resolution occurred within 48 h but colonization persisted for nearly 30 days (McCullers et al. 2007) . In the chinchilla model, animals infected with influenza virus experience negative middle ear pressure and eardrum inflammation associated with epithelial damage and cellular and mucosal debris accumulation in the Eustachian tube (Giebink et al. 1987) . Similarly, both virus-mediated inflammation and hearing loss are observed in neonatal mice and ferrets (Rarey et al. 1987; Short et al. 2011) . However, in contrast to the findings in chinchillas, minimal Eustachian tube damage is observed and bacterial localization specificity suggests that invasion techniques observed in other models are unlikely to be relevant to bacterial AOM (Short et al. 2011 ). Nevertheless, the increased pathology may support bacterial replication in the middle ear.",

The high proinflammatory activity of PB1-F2 intensifies disease in animal models, particularly with respect to induction and severity of bacterial coinfections (McAuley et al. 2007 (McAuley et al. , 2010a Alymova et al. 2011; Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012) , and is marked by a large influx of immune cells and cytokine storm (Conenello et al. 2007; McAuley et al. 2007 McAuley et al. , 2010a . Pathogenic PB1-F2s, such as that from the 1918 pandemic strain, elevate neutrophils and macrophages and contribute to the pathologic tissue destruction observed during bacterial coinfections (McAuley et al. 2007 ). This is likely due to regulation of the type I interferon response (le Goffic et al. 2010; Conenello et al. 2011; Varga et al. 2011 Varga et al. , 2012 and apoptotic monocytes infected with influenza (Chen et al. 2001; Gibbs et al. 2003; Zamarin et al. 2005) . Specific molecular signatures that facilitate this inflammatory environment have been identified (McAuley et al. 2007 (McAuley et al. , 2010b . Amino acids 62L, 75R, 79R, and 82L in the C-terminal portion of PB1-F2 of select strains are positively associated with inflammation and hypercytokinemia in infected animals and negatively correlated with survival.

However, given a large invasion or a compromised host state (e.g., influenza virus infected), bacterial outgrowth occurs and an inflammatory response is launched. Neutrophils appear first and are followed shortly by inflammatory macrophages (Jonsson et al. 1985; Fillion et al. 2001; Knapp et al. 2003) .

Viruses and bacteria also activate many of the same cytokines, inflammatory cells, and pattern recognition receptors (e.g., TLR4) that can synergize during coinfections and generate inflammation (Navarini et al. 2006; Joyce et al. 2009; Karlstrom et al. 2011; Kuri et al. 2013 ). Interference of immune responses occurs through various manners, such as by viral expression of multifunctional proteins like the influenza virus NS-1 (Hale et al. 2008 ) and PB1-F2 (McAuley et al. 2007 . Depending on the stage of influenza, the innate, cellular, and anergic responses may differentially synergize.",

The activity of neutrophils and macrophages is dampened along with their cytokine production as natural killer (NK) cells become impaired during influenza virus infection and undergo additional suppression during coinfections as a result of heightened TNF-a expression (Small et al. 2010) . Further functional suppression of these cells occurs when type I interferons (IFNa,b) place epithelial cells in antiviral states and alter their chemotactic functions (Joyce et al. 2009; Shahangian et al. 2009; le Goffic et al. 2010; Conenello et al. 2011; Nakamura et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012) . For instance, neutrophil chemoattractants KC and MIP-2 (Shahangian et al. 2009 ) and macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 (Nakamura et al. 2011 ) all become downregulated, which inhibits recruitment of immune cells leading to inefficient bacterial clearance. IFN-a,b may also decrease Th-17 cytokines IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 during S. aureus coinfection, which increases inflammation and decreases viral and bacterial clearance (Kudva et al. 2011) .",

Indeed, novel analyses of coinfection kinetics identified and detailed the dominant mechanism driving influenza-pneumococcal synergy as a direct viral-dependent reduction in bacterial phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages . We predicted that this phagocytosis is reduced by 85-90 % at day 7 of the influenza virus infection. We later confirmed that this was a major driver of influenza-pneumococcal synergy with a mouse model by labeling and tracking these cells before and during influenza infections . Our experiments showed that the resident macrophage population declines as influenza progresses, suggesting that influenza virus directly depletes these cells rather than simply reducing their function. Furthermore, bacterial outgrowth correlated to the level of depletion, which offers new insight into why the timing of bacterial infection has a profound impact on disease outcome .",

The degree and length of this suppression is viral strain-dependent (Ludewick et al. 2011) , and occurs through diverse mechanisms. For instance, alveolar macrophages with high expression of homeostatic moieties such as CD200R, a regulatory antiinflammatory ligand (Barclay et al. 2002; Minas and Liversidge 2006; Snelgrove et al. 2008; Jiang-Shieh et al. 2010) , become desensitized when expression of CD200 on apoptotic immune cells increases and open the airways to bacterial invasion (Goulding et al. 2011) . In conjunction, absence of CD200R in mice inhibits bacterial outgrowth and prevents migration of bacteria to exogenous sites, such as the blood, in influenza-infected mice (Goulding et al. 2011) . Elevated glucocorticoid levels also cause sustained immunosuppression, as was demonstrated in a model of Listeria monocytogenes coinfection (Jamieson et al. 2010) .",

Determining if bacterial gene products from various species have similar effects during infection and, if so, how they complement viral factors is an important, but largely unexplored, area. Another interesting area for investigation in animal models is the idea that the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiome affects the development of antiviral responses to pathogens (Ichinohe et al. 2011; Licciardi et al. 2012; Abt et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013) .

Viral load dynamics can be accurately modeled using target-cell limitation (Fig. 3) , through undefined mechanisms, as the primary means of viral control while excluding specific immune responses (Baccam et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2011a) . It is important to note that these models do not discount the fact that Fig. 3 Kinetics of influenza-pneumococcal coinfection. Model schematic and equations that result in the observed kinetics of influenza virus infection followed by pneumococcus given 7 days postinfluenza infection . During primary influenza, susceptible epithelial (target) cells (T) become infected at a rate bV per cell. Infected cells (I 1 ) first undergo an eclipse phase at rate k per cell prior to entering a state (I 2 ) in which virus is produced. Productively infected cells are lost, through apoptosis, viral cytopathic effects, or removal by immune cells, at a rate d per cell. Virus (V) is produced at rate p per cell, which is significantly increased by bacterial presence (aP z ) (boxed), and cleared at rate c. Invading pneumococci (P) proliferate at maximum rate r with a tissue capacity K p CFU/ml. Bacteria are cleared via phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages (M A ) at rate cf per cell, which is significantly reduced by virus presence /V=\u00f0K PV \u00fe V\u00de \u00f0 \u00de(boxed). With this kinetic description, viral titers increase exponentially, peak and begin to decline prior to bacterial invasion. Once bacteria are present, a viral rebound occurs and bacteria grow exponentially before reaching a maximum capacity. The potential increase in bacterial adherence to virus-infected cells and any accompanying cell death has little effect are excluded here immunological factors may drive influenza virus pathogenesis, but that this information can simply not be extracted from viral loads Miao et al. 2011) . Quantifying the effect that host factors have on viral replication has been restricted by the limited amount of data detailing the innate immune responses [reviewed in (Smith and Perelson 2011)] .

The dose-dependent invasive ability of pneumococci was solely dependent on the number and phagocytic ability of resident macrophages initially present. Thus, any alterations to resident cells, such as death from an antecedent viral infection, would result in immediate pathogenic invasion. While the rapid neutrophil influx could facilitate bacterial removal, pneumococcal-induced neutrophil apoptosis hindered complete eradication. This process was also dependent on alveolar macrophages and whether they were engaged damage control rather than bacterial clearance. Inflammatory macrophages had little effect on clearance but still contributed to respiratory tract damage. Through this model, we successfully captured the biochemical, cellular, immunological interactions of pneumococci with the host and identify the critical processes driving pathogenesis.",

Our model predicts that bacterial interaction with virus-infected epithelial cells releases virus and thus increases viral loads postbacterial invasion. Bacterial proteases or NAs may liberate virus in the same manner as viral NA. S. aureus proteases can activate influenza virus HA cleavage and enhance viral invasion into host cells (Tashiro et al. 1987) . Furthermore, some commensal bacteria [e.g., S. mitis (Nonaka et al. 1983; Beighton and Whiley 1990) , certain S. pneumoniae (Scanlon et al. 1989) , Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus (Moncla and Braham 1989) , Porphyromonas gingivalis (Moncla et al. 1990) , and S. oralis (Homer et al. 1996) ] that secrete NAs or exogenous NA can rescue influenza virus replication if viral NA is missing or inhibited (Liu and Air 1993; Hughes et al. 2000; Nishikawa et al. 2012) . Thus, it is feasible that other NA possessing bacterial species can act in the manner predicted by our model. To uncover the underlying mechanism, a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments with viruses and bacteria that exhibit differential expression of NA is necessary .",

            "text": "Pathogenicity of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain was likely impacted by possession all four inflammatory signatures together with the 66S polymorphism. While the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic strains also had all four amino acids, both lacked the 66S polymorphism. Subsequent circulating strains became truncated in the H1N1 lineage around 1948(McAuley et al. 2010a) and mutations in the H3N2 lineage resulted in loss of the inflammatory signatures by the 1980s. In fact, an antibacterial phenotype emerged in the H3N2 lineage such that viruses and invading bacteria compete via PB1-F2 expression rather than synergize(Alymova et al. 2011;Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012). The expression of these signatures and the length of PB1-F2 proteins vary widely within influenza viruses. In general, viruses with only the 66S signature or a full set of the polymorphisms strongly support bacterial pathogens, while truncation results in an intermediate phenotype(Zell et al. 2007) and a single substitution at position 82 confers anti-inflammatory properties(Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012). The range of phenotypes highlights the intricate and complicated nature of influenza infections and coinfections and links specific molecular signatures to pathogenicity. It is important to note that each of these effects was demonstrated in animal models using specific viruses [e.g., H3N2(Alymova et al. 2011), swine H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 (Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012]. The H5N1 viruses are of particular interest for further study since they have little diversity in their PB1-F2, are typically full length, and are more likely to possess the full inflammatory panel with the exception of the 66S polymorphism(Smith and McCullers 2013).",
