They contracted with physicians to provide care for their members for a fixed amount per year. Despite the opposition of local medical societies, this approach to assuring access to care grew rapidly and many assumed it was the way most care would be financed in the future. 8 They saw no reason to undermine their influence in recruiting new members by substituting \"compulsory governmental paternalism for private voluntary fraternalism.\" It was also easy to appeal to the broader aversion to racial and ethnic mixing that state legislation implied.",

State Medicaid programs became dominated by Medicaid only HMO plans and DRGs shifted much of the care that had been provided in acute hospitals back into more segregated communities. 11 The Clinton Health Security Act of 1994, relying heavily on HMO contracting in the face of rising opposition to such arrangements from those with private insurance never had a chance. 12 Steps in expanding coverage subsequently followed the lead of conservative think tanks, expanding coverage but privatizing it. This did little to control costs but the more fragmented \"free market\" approach helped insulate the health system from civil rights challenges.
