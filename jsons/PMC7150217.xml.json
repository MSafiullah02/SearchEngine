Annually, approximately 5 million children and infants die worldwide due to diarrheal diseases. In North America, the rate per year is still 0.9 diarrheal episodes per child, and in special circumstances (daycare centers, institutions), the incidence is as high as 5 episodes per year. Fourteen hospital admissions per 1000 children younger than 12 months, per year, result from acute diarrhea. Among the adult population, most patients developing acute diarrhea are managed as outpatients or will not seek medical attention. However, 0.5 million hospital admissions per year, or 1.5% of all adult hospital admissions annually, are due to diarrhea. In developing countries, inadequate water supply, inefficient or nonexistent sewage removal systems, chronic malnutrition, and lack of access to oral rehydration are responsible for the high incidence of infectious diarrheal diseases. In the industrialized world, acute diarrhea is still one of the most frequent diagnoses in general practice and children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients are the most vulnerable individuals and account for the majority of these cases.",

Approximately 100 million episodes of acute diarrhea occur in the United States yearly, with an incidence of 1.2 to 1.5 diarrheal episodes per person-year. Medical costs/analyses show that 8.0 million Americans sought physician care for diarrhea yearly and 250,000 required hospitalization. Hospitalization and medical costs approached $560 million, whereas lost productivity totaled $200 million. Approximately another 8 million people sought physician care but were not hospitalized. These patients incurred $690 million in medical costs and $2 billion in loss of work hours. An estimated 90 million cases occurred in people who did not seek physician care, costing nearly $20 billion in lost productivity. Approximately 90% of all these cases were presumably of infectious origin. Thus, the total cost estimate for diarrheal diseases exceeds $23 billion annually in the United States alone.",

In most gut infections, a pathogen enters via the oral route and colonizes an area of the intestine. Exceptions to this paradigm are the ingestion of preformed toxins. Pathogens produce diarrhea by three basic mechanisms: (1) enterotoxins that induce active intestinal secretion (Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, rotavirus); (2) cytotoxic mediators (most bacteria, parasites); and (3) invasins promoting endocytosis, with subsequent tissue invasion and mucosal injury [Shigella, Salmonella, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)]. In addition to direct effects by microorganisms and their products, enteropathogens induce intestinal damage indirectly via the mucosal inflammatory response, which involves secretion of various powerful mediators of secretion and apoptosis. A summary of the current knowledge about the pathogenesis of the most common acute infectious diarrheal syndromes is shown in Fig. 1.\n",
