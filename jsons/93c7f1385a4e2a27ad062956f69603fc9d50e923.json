Today, real-time retro transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR) is the reference test for the detection of respiratory viruses in clinical microbiology laboratories. However, such tests still require extensive hands-on time and have an average analytical turnaround time of 3-4 hours. Rapid immunochromatographic tests for the detection of viral antigens have an average turnaround time of 20 min, excellent specificity (Sp), but still are hampered by limited sensitivity (Se) that necessitate to confirm negative results using a technique presenting optimal Se (Aslanzadeh et al., 2008; Falsey et al., 2005; Paulson, 2009; Zazueta-Garcia et al., 2014 ). The GeneXpert system (Cepheid, France) is designed for nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and real-time detection using a single-use disposable cartridge and an automated platform. The Cepheid Xpert\u00ae Flu/RSV XC assay allows determination of infections caused by influenza A viruses (Flu A), inclusive of both human and avian strains; influenza B viruses (Flu B); and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) within 63 min. To determine Se, Sp, positive predictive value and negative predictive values, results obtained with the Xpert\u00ae Flu/RSV XC were compared with those observed with single-plex rt-RT-PCR tests routinely used in the virology laboratory for diagnostic purpose (Duchamp et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; van Elden et al., 2001 van Elden et al., , 2003 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 155, "text": "(Salez et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 731, "end": 756, "text": "(Aslanzadeh et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 757, "end": 777, "text": "Falsey et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 778, "end": 792, "text": "Paulson, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 793, "end": 820, "text": "Zazueta-Garcia et al., 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1531, "text": "(Duchamp et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1549, "text": "Kim et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1572, "text": "van Elden et al., 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1597, "text": "van Elden et al., , 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A total of 281 nasal swab (n = 170) and nasopharyngeal aspirate (n = 111) samples were selected.
