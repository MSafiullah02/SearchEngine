After the discovery of viroids in 1971 (2), hepatitis D virus (HDV) was described in 1977 (3) as the first human pathogen with an RNA genome resembling viroids. Like viroids, the circular genome of HDV forms secondary structures by self-complementarity, although the genome of HDV is roughly four times bigger (4). Viroids also replicate by the rolling circle mechanism and possess ribozyme activity (4). However, unlike viroids, HDV encodes a functional protein, and it also requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a helper virus (4). Until recently, deltaviruses had been found only in humans. Then, in 2018, HDV-like sequences were reported from two nonhuman hosts (5, 6). The findings challenged the view on the origin and evolution of HDVs within their human host (7).",

            "text": "Before the discovery of novel deltaviruses (5, 6, 8), HDV was unique among animal viruses, and it formed the genus Deltavirus which has not been assigned to a family (9). The negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome of HDV is approximately 1.7 kb, circular, and highly self-complementary, and as a result of this, it forms unbranched rod-like structures (10, 11). During replication, both genomic and antigenomic viral RNA are found in the infected cells (12). The only conserved open reading frame (ORF) of HDV is in antigenomic orientation and encodes the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg, used for HDV) (10). Both RNA strands possess ribozyme activity responsible for self-cleavage (13). The ribozyme was initially speculated to also mediate the ligation to form the circular genome (14), but later studies indicated involvement of host enzymes (15). As HDV encodes only HDAg, it cannot form infectious particles without a helper virus (16). The discovery of HDV in liver specimens of HBV-positive individuals directly associated HDV with HBV as a satellite virus (3). Later studies demonstrated the transmissible and pathogenic nature of HDAg (17) and that HDV relies on the envelope glycoproteins of HBV to form infectious particles (16). Although helper virus is required for producing infectious particles, the rolling circle replication (12) proceeds independently of the helper virus (18), as it is mediated by host RNA polymerase II (19). During the viral life cycle, two different forms of HDAg, small HDAg (S-HDAg) and large HDAg (L-HDAg), are produced (20). The HDAg ORF encodes the S-HDAg, and a base transition in the amber stop codon results in the elongation of the protein at the carboxy terminus by 19 additional amino acids, thus giving rise to the L-HDAg (21). The two antigen forms have highly diverse roles in the viral life cycle, e.g., S-HDAg promotes viral replication, while L-HDAg inhibits viral replication (20, 22). In fact, L-HDAg also suppresses the expression of HBV proteins and acts in the assembly of infectious particles (23).",

The disease outcome varies greatly and depends on the mode of HDV infection (25). Coinfection often results in acute hepatitis, which tends to be self-limited, whereas superinfection can lead to a fulminant hepatitis which in many cases becomes chronic, ultimately leading to liver cirrhosis (26). In these patients, the risk of liver failure or development of subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma is high (26). However, the disease is also influenced by the HDV genotype (25); eight HDV genotypes are currently known (27). While HDV-1 occurs worldwide, the other genotypes have a specific geographic distribution (27). Interestingly, a very recent study reported HDV to be capable of producing infectious particles utilizing envelope glycoproteins of several viruses (28).",

            "text": "The report on discovery of a HDV-like agent in birds (5) prompted us to publish our observation of a similar, yet genetically distant, agent in snakes (6). Both the avian and snake deltaviruses (AvDV and SDeV, respectively) possess a negative-sense, highly self-complementary circular RNA genome, including ribozymes (5, 6). The findings complemented one another, since no hepadnaviral sequences were identified in the samples (5, 6). Moreover, we could demonstrate the presence of both viral RNA and snake delta antigen (SDAg) in several tissues, indicating that SDeV replication is not restricted to the liver (6), which likely holds true also for AvDV. In further support of the idea that the evolutionary path of HDV is much longer than initially envisioned, more HDV-like agents were identified in fish, amphibians, and invertebrates in early 2019 (8). Similarly to AvDV and SDeV, the newly found deltaviruses were not associated with hepadnavirus infection (8). The new findings have raised the question whether deltaviruses are indeed dependent on hepadnavirus coinfection or not. The authors of the report on AvDV identified sequences matching influenza A virus genome in the same samples (5); similarly, we could demonstrate replication of both reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses in the snakes with SDeV (6). These findings led us to hypothesize that deltaviruses have evolved to use persistent or recurrent infection-causing enveloped viruses as their helpers. The aim of our study was to experimentally demonstrate that SDeV can utilize the envelope glycoproteins of viruses other than hepadnaviruses to form infectious particles.",

            "text": "We originally identified SDeV when performing a metatranscriptomic analysis of a brain sample from a snake with central nervous system signs (6). Subsequent reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening demonstrated the presence of SDeV in multiple tissues, including liver and blood, and further metatranscriptomic analyses of blood and liver samples revealed no traces of an HBV-like virus; instead, we retrieved genomes of coinfecting reptarena- and hartmaniviruses. Since hepadnaviruses are hepatotrophic, we reasoned that successful isolation from the brain on cells other than liver cells would indicate that SDeV could utilize arenaviruses for the formation of infectious particles. We inoculated cultured boid kidney cells (I/1Ki) with the SDeV-infected brain homogenate and at 15 days postinfection (dpi) analyzed the cells by immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Affinity purification served to produce anti-SDAg and anti-NP (reptarenavirus nucleoprotein, the main antigen present in infected cells), which we directly labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 dyes (anti-SDAg-AF488, anti-SDAg-AF594, anti-NP-AF488, and anti-NP-AF594). Our studies show that the anti-NP antibody can be used to detect all reptarenavirus NPs thus far described (30\u201333). As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the reagents produce hardly any background and can be used for costaining of SDeV and reptarenaviruses. Figure 1 further demonstrates isolation of SDeV by inoculating I/1Ki cells with the infected brain homogenate. Titration of the supernatant collected at 7 dpi shows that the infected cells produce progeny virions on clean I/1Ki cells with titers reaching 4.0 \u00d7 103 fluorescent focus-forming units/ml (fFFU/ml). To ascertain whether the number of SDAg-expressing cells would increase over time and whether SDeV could establish a persistent infection, we passaged the infected cells and analyzed them by IF staining at roughly 6 months after inoculation. The staining (Fig. 1) shows that the majority of cells are coinfected with SDeV, reptarenavirus, and hartmanivirus, suggesting a permanent infection with all three viruses.",

            "text": "After successfully isolating SDeV in cell culture, we aimed to study SDeV replication without coinfecting viruses. As replication of HDV occurs via rolling circle replication (12), we generated expression constructs with multiple copies of the SDeV genome, an approach successfully applied in HDV reverse genetics (18). We ordered a synthetic gene comprising two copies of the SDeV genome and subcloned the insert in genomic (pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD [FWD stands for forward]) and antigenomic (pCAGGS-SDeV-REV [REV stands for reverse]) orientation into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS/MCS (MCS stands for multiple cloning site). Because the expression of SDAg is considered essential for virus replication, we included a T7 promoter in antigenomic orientation to enable optional (i.e., when the T7 RNA polymerase is coexpressed) antigenomic transcription. The expression constructs are schematically presented in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material, and the inserts with putative transcripts produced from the constructs are shown in Fig. 2. Assuming that the snake cells do not initiate transcription at the T7 promoter, the pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD construct would produce SDAg only as a result of virus replication, whereas the pCAGGS-SDeV-REV construct would produce the SDAg without virus replication under the \u03b2-actin promoter of pCAGGS. To study SDAg expression, we transfected Boa constrictor (I/1Ki) and African green monkey (Vero E6) kidney cells and studied the cells by IF staining at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days posttransfection (dpt). As Fig. 3A demonstrates, SDAg can be detected from day 1 onwards with both constructs and cell lines. The fact that pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD transfection induces SDAg production suggests initiation of SDeV replication. Interestingly, at 1 and 2 dpt, the SDAg was predominantly found in the cytoplasm when expressed from the pCAGGS-SDeV-REV plasmid, whereas transfection with the pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD plasmid resulted in a predominantly nuclear localization of SDAg. At 4 dpt, however, SDAg was mostly detected in the cytoplasm for both constructs. The observed localization differences could be due to differences in transcription if the protein is produced under the \u03b2-actin promoter present in the plasmid (pCAGGS-SDeV-REV) compared to when the protein is expressed as a result of viral replication. The shuttle of the two HDAg forms between the nucleus and cytoplasm is mediated by posttranslational modifications (34), which could also be different in replication versus transcription from plasmid DNA. Furthermore, similarly to HDV, SDeV\u2019s genomic and antigenomic RNA species could employ different cellular machineries for replication (35), thus adding a potential explanation to the observed differences. We also analyzed the transfected cells by Western blotting (WB) and could demonstrate an increasing amount of SDAg during the 4 days of transfection (Fig. 3B). The S-SDAg and L-SDAg have estimated molecular weights of 22.7 and 25.6 kDa, respectively (6). For a loading control, we probed the membranes with pan-actin antibody, which produced bands of expected sizes (around 42 kDa) in WB (Fig. 3B).",

We transfected human lung carcinoma (A549), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), cervical cancer (HeLa), and embryonic kidney (HEK293FT) cell lines with the pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD plasmid and used IF to demonstrate the presence of SDAg. IF staining at 5 dpt showed cytoplasmic expression of SDAg in all cell lines studied (Fig. 4A). In addition, we found prominent SDAg staining in the nuclei of A549 and HepG2 cells. To study whether similar differences in SDAg localization would occur in snake cells, we transfected boid kidney (I/1Ki and V/1Ki), heart (V/2Hz), liver (V/1Liv), and lung (V/5Lu) cell lines with the pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD plasmid. We performed IF staining at 5 dpt and observed a variable SDAg expression pattern depending on the cell line (Fig. 4B). However, in all cell lines, SDAg was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Curiously, the localization appeared to be more pronounced in the nucleus in liver and heart cell lines. With the current set of experiments, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the observed SDAg expression in mammalian cells is a consequence of leaky transcription from the T7 promoter, since some mammalian cells can use the T7 promoter for transcription (36, 37).",

            "text": "After demonstrating that transfection of cultured snake cells with pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD induces SDeV replication, we wanted to study the effect of prolonged maintenance of the transfected cells under normal culture conditions. The extent of the cytopathic effect induced by the initial transfection varied considerably between the cell lines used, but we allowed the surviving cells to reach confluency. We passaged the cells until they reached a surface area of approximately 150 to 175 cm2, and all\u2014except the lung cell line (V/5Lu)\u2014revived within a few weeks after the transfection. IF to detect SDAg (Fig. 4C) showed its expression in all cell lines, but the number of SDeV-infected cells appeared to vary between the cell lines. For I/1Ki, V/1Liv, and V/2Hz cells, most cells displayed SDAg, indicating active replication, whereas for V/1Ki cells, only 5 to 10% of the cells were SDAg positive. The localization of SDAg varied between the different cell lines, but most often SDAg was found in both cytoplasm and nucleus, which is similar to what we observed in vivo (6). We named the persistently SDeV-infected cell lines I/1Ki-\u0394, V/1Ki-\u0394, V/1Liv-\u0394, V/2Hz-\u0394, and V/5Lu-\u0394. Analysis of the cells by IF at approximately 6 months after the initial transfection showed that most cells express SDAg. To confirm that the observed SDAg expression is indeed due to permanent infection as opposed to transcription from the T7 promoter, we analyzed the cells for the presence of plasmid DNA. To demonstrate that the plasmid DNA would be detected by the chosen approach, we analyzed freshly transfected I/1Ki cells at 1, 4, and 7 dpt. As a further indication of gradual disappearance of the plasmid, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to demonstrate that the amount of plasmid DNA reduces proportionally when passaging the transfected cells. The results show that the generated cell lines do not possess detectable amounts of pCAGGS-SDeV-FWD (or -REV) plasmid (Fig. S3), verifying that the SDAg expression is indeed due to SDeV replication.",

To demonstrate that the permanently SDeV-infected cell lines can be superinfected with reptarenaviruses and/or hartmaniviruses, we incubated I/1Ki-\u0394 cells with reptarenaviruses (University of Helsinki virus-2 [UHV-2] and University of Giessen virus-1 [UGV-1]) or a hartmanivirus (Haartman Institute Snake virus-1 [HISV-1]) and analyzed the cells by IF. Figure 5A shows that I/1Ki-\u0394 cells can indeed be superinfected with reptarenaviruses (UHV-2 and UGV-1). The localization of HDAg changes from nuclear to cytoplasmic during the viral life cycle (39), and we found that most I/1Ki-\u0394 cells display SDAg in the cytoplasm. However, some cells showed a granular nuclear SDAg staining, similarly to HDAg in human hepatocytes (40), and curiously, granules appeared less abundant in the reptarenavirus superinfected I/1Ki-\u0394 cells (Fig. 5A). Next, we tested whether the other permanently deltavirus-infected cell lines could be superinfected with reptarenavirus (UGV-1) or hartmanivirus (HISV-1). IF staining shows that we could indeed superinfect all permanently SDeV-infected cell lines (V/1Ki-\u0394, V/1Liv-\u0394, and V/2Hz-\u0394) with both viruses (Fig. 5B to D). The shift of SDAg from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as a result of superinfection, suggested with experiments done on I/1Ki-\u0394 cells, appeared less clear in the other cell lines tested, and further studies are needed to determine whether coinfection indeed affects the localization of SDAg.",

We inoculated I/1Ki-\u0394 cells with UHV-2, UGV-1, or HISV-1, collected supernatant up to 8 dpi, and analyzed it for infectious particles. Subsequently, we inoculated a fresh monolayer of clean I/1Ki cells with the supernatants and used supernatant collected from nonsuperinfected (mock) I/1Ki-\u0394 cells as the control. At 2 to 5 dpi, we IF stained the cells for SDAg and counted the number of fluorescent foci at each time point; examples of IF staining are shown in Fig. S4. The nonsuperinfected I/1Ki-\u0394 cells did not produce infectious particles, while the cells superinfected with either reptarenaviruses or hartmanivirus produced infectious SDeV particles (Fig. 6A). The production of infectious SDeV particles appeared to be the most efficient in HISV-1-infected cells, while UHV-2-infected cells produced the smallest number of infectious SDeV particles (Fig. 6A). The observed difference between the numbers of infectious SDeV particles produced in UHV-2- versus UGV-1-infected cells might be related to the comparatively lower replication rate of UHV-2, as reported in our previous study (33).",

While the envelope of both classical arenaviruses (genus Mammarenavirus) and reptarenaviruses comprises both matrix protein (ZP) and spike complexes, the envelope of hartmaniviruses lacks the ZP (33). Glycoproteins GP1 and GP2, encoded as a GPC, form the major portion of the spike complex, which in the case of mammarenaviruses and presumably, hartmaniviruses comprises also a stable signal peptide (33). We started by transfecting I/1Ki-\u0394 cells with the GPCs of HISV-1, Puumala virus (PUUV, an orthohantavirus), and UGV-1 (with and without cotransfected ZP). Additionally, we transfected the cells with HBV S-antigen (S-Ag)-bearing plasmid. We included PUUV GPC, since orthohantaviruses, like mammarenaviruses, are known to induce persistent infection in their rodent hosts and could thus represent a potential helper virus. Additionally, the GPC of orthohantaviruses is similar to that of arenaviruses in the sense that it gives rise to two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which form the spike complex (42). We could demonstrate the expression of glycoproteins using IF staining for all glycoproteins except HBV S-Ag (Fig. 8A), for which we did not include the HA epitope tag, and staining with serum from a vaccinated person produced extensive background staining. We found SDAg predominantly in the cytoplasm; however, many of the nontransfected cells displayed a punctate SDAg reaction in the nucleus. We could not conclude whether the expression of viral glycoproteins affects the localization of SDAg.",

We used ultracentrifugation to pellet the material secreted from the transfected cells and analyzed the pellets by WB. Transfection of the cells with glycoproteins appeared to enhance the secretion of SDAg; furthermore, by employing the HA tag, we could demonstrate the expressed viral glycoproteins in the pelleted material by WB (Fig. 8B). To study whether expression of glycoproteins had induced formation of infectious SDeV particles, we infected na\u00efve I/1Ki cells with the collected supernatants. The results show that the cells transfected with an empty plasmid, UGV-1 ZP, or HBV S-Ag did not produce infectious particles (Fig. 8C). In contrast, the cells cotransfected with UGV-1 ZP and GPC did produce infectious particles. Notably, expression of UGV-1 GPC alone produced larger amounts of infectious particles, indicating that the expression of ZP is not needed for the production of infectious SDeV particles (Fig. 8C). Similar to the superinfection experiments, in which HISV-1 was found as the most effective helper virus, the expression of HISV-1 GPC induced the highest concentration of infectious SDeV particles. We could also further show that the expression of the mammarenavirus and even orthohantavirus GPCs induced the production of infectious particles. We assume that the infectious titer of SDeV particles carrying LCMV, JUNV, or PUUV glycoproteins might actually be higher, since these viruses might not enter I/1Ki cells as efficiently as the snake-derived viruses (UGV-1 and HISV-1).",

HDV is a satellite virus of HBV, which mostly targets the human liver (25); hence, HDV infection is mostly associated with liver disease. HDV infection affects around 20 million people worldwide (43); however, it is currently a somewhat neglected disease due to the fact that HBV vaccination is thought to also provide protection against HDV infection. The recent discovery of deltaviruses in the absence of hepadnaviral coinfection across a wide range of taxa (5, 6, 8) provided the first indications that deltaviruses could be much more enigmatic than originally thought. We found SDeV in several tissues of the infected snakes, indicating that the virus has a broad tissue tropism and further implying that SDeV does not rely on a hepadnavirus as its helper (6). Indeed, in 2019, Perez-Vargas and colleagues demonstrated that HDV can form infectious particles utilizing the envelope glycoproteins from various viral species (28). We originally found SDeV in coinfection with reptarena- and hartmaniviruses (6), and wanted to study whether these viruses could provide the glycoprotein-decorated envelope for the production of infectious SDeV particles.",

These findings imply that SDeV replication itself is not limited to any particular cell type but instead would be restricted by the envelope borrowed from the co-/superinfecting helper virus. Similarly, HDV infection is likely not restricted to the liver since Perez-Vargas and colleagues demonstrated infectious HDV particle formation in coinfection with various enveloped viruses (28). By passaging of the cells transfected with SDeV constructs, we could demonstrate that, at least in cell culture, deltaviruses can rather easily establish a persistent infection. The persistently infected cell lines allowed us to imitate SDeV infection in vitro and to overcome the problems faced in human hepatitis virus research, i.e., the lack of a solid cell culture system that allows viral infection and propagation (44). Moreover, our results not only show that SDeV can establish and maintain a persistent infection in vitro but also indicate that helper virus is not required for persistent infection. HBV-independent persistence of HDV and subsequent rescue by HBV superinfection has been shown in woodchucks (45), chimpanzees (46), and mice (47, 48). Also, HDV can persist in human hepatocytes (in the livers of humanized mice) without its helper virus and potentially be rescued by a later HBV infection (48). The persistence of SDeV in snake cell lines shown in this study and the persistence of HDV in human hepatocytes (49) resemble each other in the sense that the accumulation of positive cells appears to rely on cell division rather than a helper virus.",

            "text": "The persistently SDeV-infected cell lines enabled us to study the release of SDAg in boa constrictor cells superinfected with reptarenaviruses and hartmanivirus. To our surprise, we found I/1Ki-\u0394 cells to secrete SDAg even without superinfection. However, cells could not be infected using the material released from nonsuperinfected cells. We also observed that the cellular distribution of SDAg differed between cell lines, ranging from mostly nuclear in liver and heart (V/1Liv and V/2Hz) to mainly cytoplasmic in lung and kidney (V/5Lu and V/1Ki) boa constrictor cell lines. The cellular distribution of HDAg changes during the viral life cycle, as the viral ribonucleoproteins are transported back and forth between the nucleus and the cytoplasm; however, this transport is influenced by different factors (39). It could be that some cell lines express proteins capable of triggering redistribution of SDAg. Such proteins could include, e.g., hepadnaviral and lentiviral glycoproteins integrated into the host\u2019s genome. In fact, infectious HDV particles can be formed via low-level expression of genome-integrated HBV S-Ag (50). It remains unclear to what degree endogenous viral elements found in animals, plants, and fungi could also contribute to the formation of infectious deltavirus particles and thereby also to their spread. Alternatively, it could be speculated that the observed cellular distribution of SDAg in kidney and lung cells would be due to secretion within vesicles. In support of the latter hypothesis, we observed that the SDAg secreted from I/1Ki-\u0394 cells migrates to the same fractions as reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses in density gradient ultracentrifugation. By superinfecting I/1Ki-\u0394 cells with reptarenaviruses and hartmanivirus, we could induce production of infectious SDeV particles. We could further demonstrate that the expression of glycoproteins alone induces formation of infectious SDeV particles, even though the ZP of arenaviruses is known to contribute to the budding of virions (51). The cotransfection of ZPs did not improve but instead reduced the efficiency of SDeV particle production, which could in theory be explained by the ability of ZPs to promote budding and formation of particles without viral glycoproteins. Interestingly, hartmanivirus infection or the expression of hartmanivirus glycoprotein seemed to induce the most efficient production of infectious SDeV particles. The dissimilarity could be due to the suggested differences between reptarenavirus (no cytoplasmic tail) and hartmanivirus (cytoplasmic tail with putative late domains) glycoproteins (33). We could further show that the expression of mammarenavirus (LCMV or JUNV) and hantavirus (PUUV) glycoproteins also induces formation of infectious SDeV particles. We have also applied the same approach for HDV and observed that the expression of arenavirus and hantavirus glycoproteins is sufficient for the production of infectious particles. Since parallel findings using hepacivirus, flavivirus, and vesiculovirus helpers have recently been published by Perez-Vargas and coauthors (28), we have decided not to include our results regarding HDV in this article. However, taken together, these findings imply that various deltaviruses would rely on several different helper viruses to complete their life cycle.",

            "text": "These newly described characteristics of deltaviruses raise numerous questions regarding the range of possible helper viruses, and factors contributing to deltavirus-glycoprotein interactions and subsequent infectious particle formation. Further studies will need to address which viruses can act as deltavirus helpers. It is tempting to speculate that deltaviruses would be opportunistic microbes, the exit (or infectious particle formation) of which would rely on persistent, latent, or recurring infections by enveloped viruses. Such infections could include arenaviruses and hantaviruses, both of which cause persistent infection in rodents (52, 53). In humans, examples of persistent viral infections could include HBV, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, the first two of which have already been demonstrated to induce the formation of infectious HDV particles (28). Additionally, recurring infections such as those caused by ortho-, paramyxo-, or coronaviruses or latent infections caused by, e.g., herpesviruses, could contribute to the spread of deltaviruses. Thus, it seems fair to speculate that HDV could present merely the tip of an iceberg in terms of human deltavirus infections. This theory would be supported by the detection of HDAg in the absence of HBV from the salivary glands of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome patients (54). As the number and variety of deltaviruses are greater than earlier assumed, it would be worth to explore whether deltaviruses are underlying or exacerbating agents in both animal and human diseases. It is tempting to speculate that a common ancestor of deltaviruses could be found among viroids of higher plants, as they show the highest similarities with deltaviruses (4). Since a deltavirus has already been identified in termites (8), one could hypothesize that the deltavirus ancestor was transmitted to Animalia from plants. Indeed, Van Bogaert and colleagues showed the presence of viroids in aphids feeding on infected plants (55), which could support the above hypothesis. However, the questions regarding the origin of deltaviruses will need to be addressed by further studies.",

Briefly, we collected the supernatants up to 14 dpi, cleared by centrifugation (30 min, 4,200 \u00d7 g, +4\u00b0C), and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm syringe filter (Millipore). The supernatants were placed in either 25- by 89-mm (for SW28 rotor) or 14- by 89-mm (for SW41 rotor) Ultra-Clear tubes (Beckman Coulter) that had been underlaid with 3 ml (for SW28 rotor) or 1 ml (for SW41 rotor) of 25% (wt/vol) sucrose (in TBS) using a thin needle. Ultracentrifugation (27,000 rpm,1.5 to 2 h, +4\u00b0C, for both SW28 and SW41 rotor) was performed, the supernatant and sucrose cushion were poured off, and the pellets were resuspended in TBS. We used the same protocol for concentrating the supernatants collected from transfected I/1Ki-\u0394 cells. For density gradient ultracentrifugation, we used Gradient Master (BioComp) to prepare either 10 to 70% (first two attempts) or 20 to 55% (third attempt) linear sucrose gradients (in TBS) in 14- by 89-mm (for SW41 rotor) Ultra-Clear tubes (Beckman Coulter) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. We loaded the viruses concentrated as described above on top of the gradient, performed ultracentrifugation (40,000 rpm for either 18 h [first attempt], 4 h [second attempt], or 1.5 h [third attempt], +4\u00b0C, SW41 rotor, Beckman Coulter), and collected approximately 600-\u03bcl fractions by puncturing the tubes with a thin (23-gauge [23G] or 25G) needle.",
