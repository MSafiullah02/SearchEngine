However, cats, especially domestic shorthaired cats, often are acquired from shelters or farms and therefore pedigree data are less commonly available for cats than for dogs. Yet, only 1 report describes presumed genetic epilepsy in an experimental breeding colony.9 Craniocerebral trauma was an unlikely cause because of a lack of supportive history. Furthermore, none of the owners reported exposure to potential toxins.

This observation may imply that EUC either is a distinct disease entity in cats or that imaging of the feline hippocampus is severely limited using current imaging protocols.18, 29 Recently, FHN has been suspected based on T2\u2010weighted hyperintensitiy only and concurrent contrast enhancement was not a requested feature.15 In contrast, bilateral T2 hyperintensity in the hippocampus and piriform lobe has been interpreted as focal edema by others.30 Hence, there is ongoing discussion whether reported hippocampal changes represent the cause or consequence of seizures. In human medicine, hippocampal sclerosis is the most common pathology underlying drug\u2010resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In order to make a diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis, a standard MRI protocol is used. Common MRI features are decreased hippocampal volume, increased signal intensity on T2\u2010weighted imaging as well as disturbed internal architecture of the hippocampus.31 Attempts have been made to evaluate the use of volumetry and to define an MRI protocol for assessment of the canine hippocampus.32, 33 Nothing comparable has been published for FHN. Consequently, the diagnosis or exclusion of FHN must be based on postmortem histopathologic findings in the absence of unequivocal MRI features. Future investigations of MRI and histopathologic correlates in the same patients are needed, but may introduce bias because they focus on nonsurviving cats. Alternatively, 3T MRI may be warranted.",

This approach may have favored inclusion of cats with structural epilepsy caused by FHN or limbic encephalitis. Consequently, the prevalence of EUC was lower in the present (22%) than in previous investigations (38%).3, 34 Yet, both studies documented comparable age of onset, good outcomes and frequent seizure remission for long periods in association with early treatment. In this study, cats with EUC had a significantly higher 1\u2010year survival rate, compared to cats with structural epilepsy or ASS. At the end of the 12\u2010month follow\u2010up period, 73% of the EUC cats were still alive, which coincides with previous descriptions.1, 34 Seizure remission also was a frequent feature in the first systematic investigation of epileptic cats, but the follow\u2010up time was very variable (ie, 3\u201318 months) and only subtle structural brain lesions were found.35 We confirmed that many cats with EUC had an excellent long\u2010term prognosis and that the epilepsy tended to follow a self\u2010remitting course in a proportion of cats. Cats with EUC exhibited a 44% seizure remission rate with phenobarbital treatment. This remission rate is higher than observed in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy with reported long\u2010time seizure remission rates from 15 to 24%.36, 37, 38 In this investigation, cats with seizure remission were treated earlier in their disease course. Research in human patients has shown that in addition to underlying cause (and possibly age), early seizure control also is an important indicator of outcome.39, 40, 41 Our data indicate that an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach may improve prognosis and may be associated with favorable outcome as suggested previously.1, 34, 42 However, it is still possible that EUC follows a self\u2010limiting course, which is either defined by complete seizure remission or low seizure frequency with interictal periods >1 year.",

The role of inflammation as a predisposing cause for seizures has been the focus of recent epilepsy research.43, 44, 45 Hematology and CSF findings including cytology were not suggestive of inflammation, and other evidence for inflammation was only present in 1 cat, as indicated by neutrophilia and an enlarged mesenterial lymph node. However, 1 cat did not have CSF analysis or PME performed, and therefore inflammation might have been missed in this cat. Limbic encephalitis associated with antibodies against VGKC recently has been proposed in cats with CPS with orofacial involvement and suspected hippocampal pathology.16 The clinical features and the outcome of cats in this study are very similar to those of cats with CPS and orofacial involvement. However, in our case series we were unable to confirm hippocampal signal intensity changes and thus were reluctant to use the terms hippocampal necrosis or limbic encephalitis. However, because VGKC antibodies were not measured in this study, limbic encephalitis cannot be excluded as a potential cause of seizures. Therefore, future studies of feline epilepsy should not only include detailed imaging investigations, but also measurement of VGKC antibodies.",

In addition, the consistent application of diffusion\u2010weighted and postcontrast T2\u2010weighted FLAIR in addition to postcontrast T1 protocols as well as oblique views of the hippocampus might have enhanced detection of infarcts, inflammatory lesions as well as hippocampal and piriform lobe abnormalities.",
