The text approaches the issues by discussing illness due to toxins preformed in foods and toxins made once the microbes have been ingested, illness due to other mechanisms that affect the gastrointestinal tract, and finally foodborne illness that has manifestations other than purely gastrointestinal. A wide variety of the common foodborne pathogens is discussed, with a brief description of what they are, the types of illness they cause, and the kinds of food most frequently associated with them along with some commentary with regard to treatment.",

However, the definition of illness that may be attributed to food or water is broad and encompasses exposure to toxins, carcinogens, metals, prions, allergens, and other factors, in addition to the classic infective pathogens. As reviewing each of these agents in detail is beyond the scope of this article, our focus will be on food- and waterborne infections only; an extensive list of foodborne pathogens is given in Table 1. This article discusses the current epidemiology of foodborne illness, provides an overview of the various toxins and organisms considered to be the more important foodborne agents, and discusses some preventative approaches that can be used to help ensure consumers stay safe with regard to the food they prepare and eat at home. The clinical symptoms, treatment, and long-term consequences of various foodborne infections are also briefly reviewed.\n",

Typically, symptoms resolve without the need for significant medical intervention and without long-term consequence. However, on occasion foodborne infection causes severe illness or death. Unfortunately, in the early stages of illness, differentiating between a patient with an inconsequential infection and the patient who may develop life-threatening sequelae can be difficult. Some systemic consequences of infection occur several days or weeks after the initial exposure. Examples include the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) secondary to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), the development of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) after Campylobacter infection, and the association of a number of enteric bacterial pathogens with reactive arthritis and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.",

Several million children die each year worldwide from acute diarrheal disease and resulting dehydration, the majority of which is likely due to contaminated food or water. In the United States, until recently, we had very little data on the numbers and outcomes of foodborne infection. The development of the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) in 1996 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided, for the first time, the opportunity to determine the epidemiology of foodborne disease in the US population. FoodNet is the main foodborne disease component of the CDC\u2019s Emerging Infections Program (EIP), and is a collaborative venture with EIP program sites, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FoodNet performs population-based active surveillance for confirmed cases of Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Yersinia, and HUS, as well as Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora infections. In 2006, surveillance occurred within a defined population of 44.9 million Americans using information from clinical microbiology laboratories in ten states. FoodNet monitors only confirmed cases of diarrheal infection, missing cases that never present to medical attention. However, through additional surveys, FoodNet has the capacity to determine the frequency of diarrhea and the number of physician visits within the study population. Utilizing FoodNet and other data, the CDC provides our current best estimate of the true burden of foodborne infections in the United States.",

This means that, on average, somewhere between one in three and one in four Americans will have a foodborne infection each year. While these data provide an excellent estimate of disease prevalence in the United States, they also illustrate some major gaps in our knowledge of foodborne infections. Specifically, determining attribution can be very difficult. For example, in the context of sporadic infections, the precise food that has caused the illness and the point at which the food was contaminated are usually unknown. Or indeed whether the infection was acquired through person-to-person spread or by some other route is difficult to ascertain. Also, in 62 million cases, or 82% of the estimated 76 million infections each year, no specific pathogen is identified. Disease due to unidentified agents results in 265 000 hospitalizations and 3200 deaths, which begs the question as to whether these are due to known pathogens or foodborne infections yet to be discovered.",

The summer predominance of bacterial foodborne infections is likely multifactorial. Clearly, warmer weather allows for more rapid bacterial growth on food that is improperly refrigerated. Consumer habits also change in the warmer months, with more picnics and barbecues, contributing to problems with keeping food refrigerated, increased risk of cross contamination, and so on. FoodNet surveillance effectively monitors trends in the rates of infection over time and there have been a number of changes since FoodNet surveillance began, with the estimated annual incidence of several infections changing significantly from baseline to 2006 (Figure 2). The estimated incidence of infection with Yersinia decreased 50% (CI = 37\u201360%), Shigella decreased 35% (CI = 8\u201354%), Listeria decreased 34% (CI = 17\u201347%), Campylobacter decreased 30% (CI = 24\u201335%), and Vibrio increased 78% (CI = 34\u2013138%). The estimated incidence of Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, and STEC O157 did not change significantly compared with the baseline. Although Salmonella incidence did not decrease significantly overall, the incidence of Salmonella typhimurium decreased significantly (41% CI = 34\u201348%). In contrast, significant increases in incidence compared with baseline occurred for Salmonella enteritidis (28%, CI = 4\u201357%), Salmonella newport (42%, CI = 7\u201387%), and Salmonella. javiana (92%, CI = 22\u2013202%).

It does not survey for many of the common foodborne pathogens, including viruses, which are thought to cause the vast majority of foodborne illness. Similarly, it does not address the cause of illness in patients who do not have a stool sample sent for analysis: those who either do not seek medical care or do seek care but do not have a stool sample analyzed. In an adjunctive study reported by the CDC, 11% of 10 000 residents interviewed through random phone consultations reported an episode of diarrhea during the previous month. This translates to 1.4 episodes of diarrhea per person per year, which if multiplied roughly by the population of the United States, represents \u223c375 million diarrheal cases per year. In this study, merely 8% of those with a diarrheal episode sought medical care, and of those, only 20% reported submitting a stool sample for culture. Thus, our best data on the causes of acute gastrointestinal disturbance from FoodNet surveillance are based on cultures of less than 2% of diarrheal episodes. Nonetheless, despite the current limitations of our evaluation of foodborne illness, the endeavors of state, local, and federal authorities have been critical to improving our knowledge of disease frequency, pathogen epidemiology, and the establishment of control systems to limit food contamination. The knowledge gained from FoodNet surveillance allows for targeted efforts to improve food safety and education.",

Although foodborne agents cause disease by a wide variety of mechanisms, the mode of infection often falls into one of the following three categories: (1) ingestion of preformed toxins produced by bacteria in food prior to consumption; (2) infection with pathogens present in food which, following ingestion, produce toxins in the gastrointestinal tract; and (3) infection with organisms having various virulence factors that permit the microbes to be invasive, cause local damage, or create physiologic perturbations that result in clinical disease.",

The organism is known to produce up to three enterotoxins. Cereulide and the tripartite hemolysin BL have been identified specifically as emetic and diarrheal toxins, respectively. Nonhemolytic enterotoxin, a homologue of hemolysin BL, has also been associated with the diarrheal syndrome. The toxins associated with the diarrheal illness are not preformed but produced by the organism during the vegetative growth phase in the small intestine. The emetic toxin, named cereulide, is thought to be an enzymatically synthesized peptide produced as the organism grows in food, especially starchy foods such as rice and pasta. Like staphylococcal toxin, cereulide is resistant to heat, pH variation, and proteolysis, and is therefore rarely destroyed during food preparation. Its exact pathogenic mechanism remains unknown, but it has been shown to stimulate the vagus afferent by binding to the 5-HT3 receptor. The emetic syndrome presents much like S. aureus-related foodborne disease, occurring 1\u20136 h after exposure and causing nausea and vomiting. Fever is not characteristic of the illness and full recovery usually occurs. Diagnosis can be made by finding the organism in the food or vomitus of the patient, or through detection of the emetic toxin through bioassays or the enterotoxins by commercial immunoassays. New approaches include the use of real-time PCR to detect Cereulide-producing B. cereus genes in potentially contaminated food.",

Histamine is produced by bacterial metabolism of the amino acid histidine in fish muscle. Bacterial replication and histamine production occur when fish is not frozen promptly after being caught or is stored at room temperature for several hours. Symptoms of intoxication begin within minutes to several hours following ingestion. Most resolve fully within hours, but, occasionally, bronchospasm or circulatory collapse may occur.

It affects 50 000 individuals yearly, mainly in the Caribbean and South Pacific islands. The toxin is produced in reef algae, the dinoflagellates (e.g., Gambierdiscus toxicus). It spreads through the food chain via consumption of smaller organisms and fish by larger predators, accumulating at dangerous levels in the flesh of large fish. Two groups of compounds are implicated in ciguatera fish poisoning: the lipid-soluble ciguatoxins, which activate nerve synapse sodium channels, and the water-soluble maitotoxin, which induces neurotransmitter release by binding to calcium channels. In humans, these toxins cause gastrointestinal symptoms 3\u20136 h after ingestion, including nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Neurologic symptoms follow, with weakness, heat\u2013cold temperature reversal, vertigo, ataxia, paresthesias, and dysathesias of the perioral region, palms, and soles. Death and serious cardiovascular complications are uncommon. Most symptoms resolve within a week, but neurologic symptoms can persist for months. The diagnosis of ciguatera is clinical; however, the toxin can be detected in fish using a mouse bioassay or newer enzyme immunoassays.",

Like ciguatera, illness is due to toxins generated by algae, usually dinoflagellates, which accumulate in the shellfish. The paralytic variant of shellfish poisoning is due to saxitoxin, an agent that blocks neuronal sodium channels and prevents propagation of the action potential. Clinically, this results in a rapid-onset, life-threatening paralysis. Brevitoxin, the agent responsible for neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, also binds sodium channels but does not cause paralysis; instead, it produces a clinical syndrome similar to but less severe than ciguatera. Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and paresthesias occur within hours of exposure and resolve completely within 3 days. Diarrheic shellfish poisoning causes gastrointestinal disturbance with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The toxin acts by increasing protein phosphorylation.",

Although antibiotic therapy is not routinely required, many antimicrobials are effective; ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones are recommended for serious infection. Yersinia infection is most frequently associated with raw or undercooked pork consumption. Swine are the major reservoir of these organisms, though pathogenic human strains have been found in sheep, dogs, cats, and wild rodents.

Listeriosis is the major concern from exposure to L. monocytogenes and although rare and usually occurring only in high-risk populations (1800 cases per year estimated to occur in the United States) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, with a case fatality rate of over 20%. Of the seven Listeria species, only L. monocytogenes is a significant human pathogen. It is common in the environment, present in soil, water, on plants, and in the intestinal tracts of many animals. Thirty-seven different types of mammals, at least 17 species of birds, and between 1 and 10% of humans are carriers of Listeria. Although the organism is readily killed by heat and cooking, the fact that it is ubiquitous makes recontamination a real risk. Of particular concern is that the organism is able to grow and multiply at refrigerator temperatures in certain foods, so even minor contamination of a product may result in high levels of bacteria after extended storage. The infectious dose is not known, with some studies suggesting it may be as high as 109 organisms, and others suggesting that it may be as low as several hundred. The more critical determinant of Listeria infection is likely individual susceptibility, with the elderly, pregnant women, the immunocompromised, and newborns having higher rates of infection and higher mortality rates.",

Instead, these bacteria are highly host adapted, infecting only humans and some nonhuman primates. Transmission occurs when a food product is contaminated by human fecal material. There are four different species of Shigella (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. sonnei, and S. boydii) and all cause human disease. In the United States and other developed countries, most infection is due to S. sonnei, though S. flexneri is also common. One of the most striking features of shigellosis is the very small inoculum of organisms required to cause disease: as few as 10\u2013100 of the most virulent genus, S. dysenteriae, are sufficient to cause dysentery in healthy adult volunteers. This low infectious dose permits person-to-person spread, with \u223c20% of persons in a household becoming infected when an index case is identified in a family. Given that these organisms are not typically present in food other than through human contamination \u2013 either directly during food preparation or indirectly from contamination with human fecal material \u2013 all shigellosis could be considered to be due to person-to-person spread. A variety of foods have been implicated in shigellosis including salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken), raw vegetables, dairy products, poultry, and common-source water supplies. Shigella often cause bloody diarrhea. Some species carry Stx and may cause HUS like E. coli O157:H7. Treatment with antibiotics shortens the duration of fever, diarrhea, and bacteremia, and reduces the risk of lethal complications. It also shortens the duration of pathogen excretion in stool, thereby limiting the spread of infection. A recent concern, however, is the increasing antibiotic resistance of Shigella species. Antibiotic resistance occurs quickly in Shigella, attributed to horizontal transfer of resistance genes on integrons. Multidrug-resistant isolates have been discovered in several developing countries.",

Hepatitis E is endemic to India, Southeast and Central Asia, parts of Africa, and Mexico. It has an incubation period of 2\u20139 weeks, although most people develop symptoms around 40 days postexposure. Clinically, the disease is similar to hepatitis A, with constitutional symptoms followed by jaundice. Most patients recover, but mortality rates of up to 3% have been reported, with pregnant women at higher risk. The diagnosis is made serologically. Hepatitis E vaccines remain experimental.",

Prevention is particularly important when it comes to individuals who are young, elderly, or have compromised immune systems, and there are a number of steps that can be undertaken to minimize the potential risk. At the outset, it is important to recognize that certain groups are at much greater risk than others. This is well illustrated in the context of listeriosis in which the likelihood of developing illness varies in relation to a variety of underlying conditions (Table 4). For example, there is a 2584 times greater risk of a transplant patient becoming sick from listeriosis as compared to an individual under the age of 65 with no underlying medical conditions.\n",
