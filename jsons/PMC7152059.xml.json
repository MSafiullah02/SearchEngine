            "text": "A recently identified clonal disorder causing lymphocytosis is monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), an accumulation of clonal B lymphocytes that does not meet the criteria for CLL (greater than 5000 clonal B cells/\u00b5L), but is nevertheless defined by the presence of a clonal population of B cells. Data demonstrate that up to 10% to 15% of patients with lymphocytosis have MBL. Three major subtypes of MBL exist: the CLL immunophenotype (CD5+, CD23+), which is by far the most common; the atypical CLL type (CD5+, CD23\u2212); and non-CLL lymphoproliferative disorder (CD5\u2212). In a systematic study of blood donors more than 45 years of age, 7.1% had detectable MBL. Of these, the majority had the CLL immunophenotype and more than 93% were low-count MBL (B-cell clonal count less than 500 cells/\u00b5l). Similar to the relationship between monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance and multiple myeloma, only a small proportion of patients with CLL-type MBL (1% to 4% per year) go on to develop progressive disease requiring treatment. Epidemiologic studies of MBL patients have demonstrated strong familial risk for CLL, and the first reports of MBL came from studies of \u201cunaffected\u201d CLL family members. Studies of CLL families suggest that there is an inherited abnormality that increases the risk of developing CLL, and some families exhibit anticipation, with the disease occurring earlier in successive generations. The supposition that MBL is a progenitor lesion for CLL is strengthened by the observation that both low-count and high-count MBL carry the same cytogenetic aberrations observed in good-prognosis CLL. MBL has been identified in up to 30% of individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and up to 50% of the HCV-associated cases demonstrate the atypical CLL immunophenotype. The presence of MBL correlates with more advanced liver disease, suggesting that the persistence of viral infection is crucial to development of the B-cell clone. Follow-up for MBL patients is not clearly defined, although it is probably reasonable to evaluate lymphocyte counts with complete blood counts and follow the clone with flow cytometry at periodic intervals depending on the pace of the lymphocyte rise, the clinical scenario, the family history, and the age of the patient.3\n",

            "text": "The most common infections causing lymphocytosis are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). In young children, EBV infection frequently presents as an upper respiratory infection, but in adolescents and young adults, it can result in acute glandular fever with pharyngitis, splenomegaly, lymphadenitis, and profound reactive lymphocytosis. Lymphocytosis is less prominent in older adults. Although the B cells are targeted by EBV, the lymphocytosis consists of CD8+ lymphocytes reacting to neoantigens expressed on the surface of infected B cells. The massive T-cell response usually clears the infection in a matter of days to 1 week, and the lymphocytosis resolves. CMV infection can produce a similar lymphocytosis. In the case of CMV, however, the macrophages are the target of infection, and the T-cell lymphocytosis results from a response to the macrophage neoantigen. CMV infection and lymphocytosis are more common in older adults. In both viral infections, lymphocytosis can be profound, with 50% or more of the circulating white blood cells (WBCs) identified as lymphocytes. Examination of the peripheral smear reveals that up to 10% of the circulating lymphocytes are atypical and larger than normal lymphocytes with open chromatin and increased cytoplasm. It is particularly important to recognize lymphocytosis caused by these two viruses in pregnant women because congenital infection can cause fetal death and birth defects. In addition to EBV and CMV, primary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause lymphocytosis and should be suspected in the presence of a viral syndrome in the appropriate clinical circumstance. In children, infection with Coxsackie A and B6 viruses, echovirus, and adenovirus can cause a brief but profound lymphocytosis. Infections with other viruses, including human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) as well as rubella virus, varicella, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and hepatitis viruses, can cause a lymphocytosis, although much less frequently than CMV and EBV.",

In an immune-competent host, Toxoplasma infection is often asymptomatic, but patients can have fever, chills, and lymphadenopathy. Mild lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes can be observed. As in the case of EBV and CMV, infections during pregnancy can lead to adverse effects on the fetus. In children and adults, infection with B. pertussis can lead to lymphocytosis, with the absolute lymphocyte count frequently greater than 10,000/\u00b5L. In more severe cases, lymphocytosis is more pronounced.4 Unlike viral infections and Toxoplasma infection, the lymphocytosis observed in B. pertussis infection is caused by increases in all lymphocyte subsets, and it appears that the pertussis toxin blocks migration of the lymphocytes from the bloodstream into lymph nodes.4 Tuberculosis, rickettsial infection, brucellosis, and shigellosis may also cause lymphocytosis.",

After strenuous physical exercise, subjects develop lymphocytosis, which returns to preexercise levels within 15 minutes to 1 hour of ceasing the activity. The exercise-induced rise is thought to be attributable to catecholamine and steroid hormones, and their effect on expression of cell adhesion molecules and on cardiac output and shear stress.5 Exposure to catecholamines increases the expression of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes influencing cell trafficking. Reports suggest that a number of other physiologic stresses increase lymphocyte counts, including surgery, trauma, cardiac conditions, sickle cell crises, abdominal pain, and obstetric emergencies. In these cases, all lymphocyte subsets appear to increase, but the increase is most profound for CD4 and CD8 memory T cells. Neutrophil counts also rise in these patients, but in most cases, the lymphocytosis resolves before the peak of the neutrophil count.6\n",

In these cases, the lymphocytosis is usually part of a systemic condition that includes a fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Elevation in other WBC counts, including eosinophils and monocytes, is common, and atypical lymphocytes are seen. The time period between drug introduction and the syndrome is usually about 3 weeks with the most common implicated drugs being aromatic anticonvulsants and sulfonamides.7 Some studies differentiate this syndrome from drug-induced cutaneous pseudolymphomas in which collections of nonclonal lymphocytes appear in the skin after longer periods of drug exposure, but there is no peripheral lymphocytosis.",

            "text": "A final entity causing lymphocytosis is persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (PPBL). This rare disorder is seen primarily in young to middle-aged women who smoke and results in mild polyclonal lymphocytosis. The lymphocytes are medium sized with abundant cytoplasm and a variable proportion is binucleate. A polyclonal increase in serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) is also observed, and there is an association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigen D-related 7 (DR7) phenotype. Examination of the B cells reveals that most are CD19+, CD5\u2212, and CD23\u2212, with a normal kappa-to-lambda ratio and a variety of heavy chain rearrangements. Adenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly has been observed in some, but not all, patients. Genetic analysis has demonstrated the presence of isochromosome 3q in a proportion of B cells, as well as the presence of multiple B-cell lymphoma immunoglobulin (BCL2-Ig) gene rearrangements. Similar gene rearrangements have been identified in family members of PPBL patients along with increases in serum IgM, suggesting that there may be an underlying genetic defect. In vitro studies have shown that PPBL cells proliferate in a CD40-CD154 culture system and secrete both IgM and IgG (isotype switching). This suggests that PPBL may arise from deregulation of the microenvironmment or from a defect in a different B-cell activation pathway resulting in extensive proliferation. Overall, the clinical course of this disorder is benign, and the lymphocytosis is not usually progressive; however, clonal B-cell disorders have been seen in a few patients with the disorder, suggesting that it may represent a preneoplastic state.8\n",

            "text": "Although there are few inherited causes of lymphocytosis, such is not the case for lymphocytopenia, in which the genetic bases of a number of inherited immunodeficiency disorders have been identified. Chief among these disorders is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by the absence of functional T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and NK cells share progenitors, signaling pathways in development and function, and metabolic pathways; thus B lymphocytes, NK cells, or both are often severely affected in SCID. Moreover, in the absence of functional CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes, B lymphocytes cannot function properly, and hypo- or agammaglobulinemia is observed. In most cases of SCID, the absence of T lymphocytes leads to an extremely low absolute lymphocyte count. As detailed in Chapter 49, SCID can be grouped based on the cellular pathway that is affected. In general, whereas SCID is characterized by complete loss of function of the affected gene, hypomorphic mutations of the same genes lead to quite different phenotypes (Omenn syndrome and atypical SCID). Defects in more than 30 genes are known to lead to SCID. Inheritance is primarily X-linked or autosomal recessive, but in a few cases, such as the DiGeorge anomaly and some cases of Hoyeraal\u2013Hreidarsson syndrome (defects in telomerase), inheritance is autosomal dominant. Until the genetic diagnosis is known, it is useful to characterize SCID syndromes as T\u2212B+NK+, T\u2212B\u2212NK+, T\u2212B+NK\u2212 or T\u2212B\u2212NK\u2212 based on the presence or absence of defects affecting B and/or NK cells. SCID can be classified based on the cellular function which is lacking, including deficiency in cytokine-mediated signaling, defects in V(D)J recombination, absent signaling through the T-cell receptor, defects in antigen presentation, and defects in basic cellular processes. Defects in the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL7RA), actin-regulating protein coronin 1A (CORO1A), CD3 chain components (CD3D, CD3E, CD3Z), and CD45 (PTPRC) lead to T\u2212B+NK+ SCID. T\u2212B+NK\u2212 SCID defects include deficiencies in cytokine-mediated signaling (IL2RG, JAK3). Defects in V(D)J recombination (RAG1, RAG2) or in nonhomologous end joining for repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DCLRE1C, PRKDC, LIG4, and NHEJ1 mutations) lead to T\u2212B\u2212NK+ SCID. Defects that lead to increased lymphocyte apoptosis (AK2, ADA gene mutations) lead to T\u2212B\u2212NK\u2212 SCID and are often associated with anomalies outside of the immune system. Defects in thymic embryogenesis and calcium flux, as well as a collection of other abnormalities, including defects in telomerase activity, can also lead to SCID and are usually associated with abnormalities of other organ systems.9\n",

Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, caused by mutations in WASP (which encodes a cytoplasmic protein responsible for transducing cell surface signals to the actin cytoskeleton), can present with low T-cell counts early in life and become profoundly lymphopenic over time. Abnormalities in immunoglobulins are also noted in this syndrome, with low levels of IgM and high levels of IgA and IgE.10 Immunodeficiency affects more than half of all patients with ataxia telangiectasia. Patients with ataxia telangiectasia have homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia\u2013mutated (ATM) gene, which encodes a protein kinase with functions in the cellular response to DNA damage. Lymphopenia, especially of naive CD4 cells, is observed in about half of patients with ataxia telangiectasia, with mutations leading to absent expression of ATM kinase activity.11 Heterozygous germline mutations in GATA2 lead to a spectrum of clinical syndromes characterized by dendritic cell, monocyte, B cell, and NK lymphoid deficiency (DCML deficiency) with elevated 3 ligand (Flt3L). Mononuclear cytopenia appears to evolve in diverse clinical groups of GATA2 mutation including monoMAC syndrome (monocytopenia, B-cell and NK-cell lymphopenia, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections and alveolar proteinosis), Emberger syndrome (lymphedema, deafness, and myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) and familial (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML)12. GATA2 mutation appears to cause loss of progenitor cells, clonal hematopoiesis and elevation of Flt3L, but the molecular mechanisms of marrow failure and transformation to MDS or AML are as yet unclear.",

The target of HIV is the CD4 receptor, and the virus selectively targets and infects activated expanding CD4 T cells. Large studies in HIV-infected patients have shown that peripheral blood CD4 T-cell counts fall most rapidly in the year after seroconversion (from approximately 1000/\u00b5L before seroconversion to 670/\u00b5L at 1 year after infection) and then decline more slowly by about 50/\u00b5L per year.13 In a subset of untreated patients, viremia is absent or well controlled, and lymphocytopenia develops very slowly if at all; particular HLA class I alleles are overrepresented in this group. Lymphopenia is an early and reliable laboratory observation in adult influenza infection and is also detected in infections caused by swine influenza (H1N1) and the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1).14 Lymphopenia has been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS-coronavirus. In children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with a reduction in lymphocyte count, which is most extreme in the sickest patients; similar effects on lymphocyte counts are seen in measles infections (also a paramyxovirus). In West Nile virus encephalitis, lymphopenia is profound and prolonged, and the initial degree of lymphopenia is predictive of outcome. A variety of other viruses can also cause lymphopenia, including herpes viruses (herpes simplex, HHV-6, HHV-8), parvovirus B19, and Dengue virus. In many viral infections, the degree of lymphopenia is correlated with the severity of the disease.14\n",

Infections with Ehrlichia (a tick-borne obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria), Salmonella typhi, and Leptospira have all been reported to cause lymphocytopenia during the acute illness. CD4+ T-cell depletion has been described in a subset of HIV-negative patients with tuberculosis and low albumin levels, low body weight, and more extensive disease. Recovery of CD4 count after treatment of tuberculosis suggests that the lymphopenia is caused by the tuberculosis infection.15 Lymphocytopenia is often observed in sepsis and is thought to occur as a result of cytokine-mediated apoptosis of B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, and follicular dendritic cells. In autopsy series, most deaths from sepsis occur during the prolonged hypoimmune state, and the more prolonged the sepsis, the more profound the loss of splenic lymphocytes. In one large retrospective study, severe persistent lymphopenia (defined as an absolute lymphocyte count of less than 600 cells/\u00b5L) on the fourth day following a diagnosis of sepsis was predictive of development of secondary infections, as well as short- and long-term survival.16\n",

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lymphopenia (usually decreases in T cells but occasionally in B cells as well) is not only one of the diagnostic criteria but also a parameter used to assess disease activity. Lymphopenia was observed in more than 60% of patients at diagnosis, with the cumulative incidence over the course of the disease reaching over 90%. Lymphopenia in SLE seems to be more frequent in patients of African descent, and in one study more than half of patients with lymphopenia demonstrated antilymphocyte antibodies. Antigalectin 8 antibodies have been described in patients with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. In SLE, these autoantibodies are associated with lymphopenia. Apoptosis may also play a role in lymphopenia in SLE, possibly by upregulation of fas antigen on naive peripheral T cells.17 CD4 T cells may also be decreased in rheumatoid arthritis, and increasing evidence suggests that deficiencies in DNA repair enzymes such as ATM render rheumatoid arthritis T cells sensitive to apoptosis.18 Apoptotic loss of naive T cells results in lymphopenia-induced proliferation to preserve T-cell homeostasis; this proliferation is now thought to lead to both premature immune aging and an autoimmune-biased T-cell repertoire. In Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, a minority of patients has been noted to have deficient CD4 counts, and this has been correlated with the presence of anti-CD4 antibodies. Similarly, low lymphocyte counts have been observed in patients with primary vasculitides, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn disease.17\n",

Lymphopenia occurs in more than 50% of sarcoidosis patients and is associated with chronic disease.

In clinical trials for multiple sclerosis, delayed release dimethyl fumarate resulted in a decrease in mean lymphocyte count of about 30% in the first year, but about 2% of patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/\u00b5L which persisted for 6 months or longer.

All of these agents are associated with profound lymphopenia, which may persist for several years after completion of treatment. In general, T cells are more affected than B cells.

Patients with CD40L mutations and rarer mutations in CD40 itself and in nuclear factor kappa-B (NF\u03baB) and essential modulator (NEMO), required for CD40-induced signaling, have combined antibody and cellular immune deficits, resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent bacterial infection, as well as opportunistic infections with organisms similar to those observed in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Defects in the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene (AID) produce hypogammaglobulinemia with recurrent bacterial infections and diarrhea, as well as enlarged lymphoid organs filled with proliferating B cells. A similar clinical picture is produced by homozygous defects in uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG). AID is thought to deaminate cytosine to uracil, and UNG subsequently deglycosylates and removes the uracil residue, creating an abasic site, which allows for creation of single-stranded DNA breaks. Deficiencies in these enzymes result in defective class switching and somatic hypermutation.

Finally, an entity termed transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy has been described in which the normal decline in immunoglobulins after maternal transfer is prolonged. This entity is poorly understood and usually affects boys, who have mild infections and diarrhea. Recovery usually, but not always, occurs by 3 years of age.27\n",

In general, treatment is directed at the underlying disease, but there are reports of polyclonal gammopathy leading to symptomatic hyperviscosity. In these cases, plasmapheresis and/or corticosteroids seem to be effective. It should also be noted that polyclonal elevations in serum immunoglobulins can sometimes interfere with the direct Coombs test, possibly via nonspecific antibody binding to red blood cells. The degree of gamma globulin elevation does not seem to be helpful in defining the underlying disease state.",

In fact, elevation of serum gamma globulins is a distinguishing characteristic of autoimmune hepatitis, and the levels usually correlate with activity of disease. The most common etiology for polyclonal gammopathy related to liver disease in the United States is likely infection with HCV, but in any particular clinical setting, the exact distribution likely depends on the population demographic. Other diseases affecting the liver, such as \u03b1-1 antitrypsin deficiency and hemochromatosis, are also accompanied by increases in serum immunoglobulins.",

In many of these diseases, the degree of gamma globulin elevation may reflect disease activity, although a causative link between the autoimmune phenomena and immunoglobulin levels has not been determined. Several of the periodic fever syndromes, which are sometimes classified with the connective tissue disorders, have elevated immunoglobulin levels as a part of their manifestations. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D is one such syndrome and is linked to mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene. Patients with this disorder present in the first year of life with febrile attacks, lymphadenopathy, abdominal symptoms, arthritis, and oral and genital ulcers. Most, but not all, patients have elevated levels of polyclonal IgD during and between episodes often accompanied by elevated IgA levels. TNF receptor 1-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) results from mutation in the gene (TNRFRSF1A) for the TNF receptor 1 and can cause prolonged febrile attacks with abdominal pain, arthralgias, and myalgias. During attacks, polyclonal elevation of immunoglobulins (primarily IgA) is observed.29\n",

These diseases include CLL; large granular lymphocytic leukemia; hairy cell leukemia; and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), a rare disease characterized by rash, widespread lymphadenopathy and extranodal involvement, autoimmune phenomena, and polyclonal gammopathy. Interestingly, despite the elevated levels of immunoglobulins observed in AITL, patients exhibit immunodeficiency and a propensity to develop opportunistic infections. Patients with myeloid disorders can also have polyclonal gammopathies; in one large series, nearly 40% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome had hypergammaglobulinemia, and patients with immunologic abnormalities had inferior survival.30 The incidence of hypergammaglobulinemia is reported to approach 50% in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Hypergammaglobulinemia has been reported in AML both in adults and children, but it appears to be a rare phenomenon. Among solid tumors, ovarian and hepatocellular cancers are most commonly associated with polyclonal gammopathy. There are case reports of cancers, particularly lung and breast tumors, producing and releasing the secretory component of IgA into the bloodstream with the binding of SC to polyclonal IgA, producing hypergammaglobulinemia of serum sIgA.",

These individual disorders are described elsewhere in this text; however, there are a few points to be made about the M protein itself and MGUS. These disorders can produce intact immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgD, or IgE), \u03ba-, or \u03bb-light chains alone or in combination with intact immunoglobulins and rarely heavy chains only. The monoclonal protein is usually detected as a discrete band in the \u03b3 or \u03b2 region in serum or urine protein electrophoresis (M spike), and then characterized and confirmed by immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE). Monoclonal antibodies have been associated with a wide variety of bacterial antigens as well as various other antigens, including thyroglobulin, von Willebrand factor, and lactate dehydrogenase; however, for most M proteins, the antigen is not recognized. A variety of other disorders are also associated with an M protein (Table 49.3\n), including connective tissue disorders, neurologic disorders (including POEMS [polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes] syndrome), renal disorders, and some infections such as HCV and HIV. Patients undergoing bone marrow and solid-organ transplants in which there is immune suppression are also occasionally observed to have M proteins, but these are usually transient and disappear with recovery of the immune system. Acquired immune disorders such as acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, type 2 acquired angioedema, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome have also been associated with M proteins.",
