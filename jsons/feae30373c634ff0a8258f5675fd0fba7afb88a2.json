The watery stools contain increased concentrations of sodium, potassium, and chloride but no significant excess of sugar or fat ( Table 1) . Mucosal disaccharidases, alkaline phosphatase, and sodiumpotassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase are significantly depressed in activity in the small intestine,t3 but adenyl cyclase activity is normal throughout the gut. 3 These findings point to disordered electrolyte transport as an important factor in the pathogenesis of transmissible gastroenteritis diarrhea. We used a marker perfusion technique to study electrolyte and water absorption at different levels of the gut and found a net secretion of water, sodium, and chloride in the jejunum of infected pigs compared with absorption in controls studied 40 hours after infection.3 Segments distal to the infected region showed a trend toward increased absorption, as if to compensate, but no significant differences were detected. Using 22Na in the same model we found the net secretion of sodium was due to a decreased flux from lumen to extracellular fluid and an increased flux from extracellular fluid to lumen. 21 When jejunal epithelium from infected pigs was studied in vitro, either in short-circuited chambers or in suspensions of epithelial cells, the most obvious defect was the failure of sodium transport to respond to glucose. 14 ,17 This particular abnormality was most marked at the stage when diarrhea was most severe. Infected tissue in short-circuited chambers responded normally to the addition of theophylline with brisk increments in electrical activity and in chloride secretion.J1 These in vitro experiments suggest a mechanism for the defective lumen to extracellular fluid flux of sodium observed in intact pigs, but fail to explain the increased extracellular fluid to lumen flux. The normal response to theophylline certainly mitigates against the possibility that cyclic adenosine monophosphate is the mediator of this secretory flux. Whether factors outside the epithelium are involved or whether our in vitro techniques have masked important transport defects that determine the secretory flow of sodium and chloride remains to be seen.",

Thymidine kinase is involved in DNA replication and normally is confined to the crypts. The fascinating implication from these data is that 25 to 40 hours after injection when diarrhea is severe the epithelium clothing the jejunal villi consists of immature cells that have migrated up from the crypts at an accelerated rate.",

However the mechanisms causing viral diarrhea differ from those causing enterotoxigenic diarrhea as seen, for example, in cholera. s , 15 The hallmarks of enterotoxigenic diarrhea are a secretory response mediated by excessive concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the epithelium while sodium absorption responds normally to glucose. In viral diarrhea cyclic adenosine monophosphate appears not to be an important mediator of secretion and sodium absorption does not respond normally to glucose.

It was the long overdue application of electron microscopic techniques to stool examination that led to the identification of infantile gastroenteritis virus. Electron photomicrographs of infantile gastroenteritis virus obtained in many centers show remarkably similar virus particles with an inner core of about 38 nm and a capsid diameter of 60 to 70 nm (Fig. 1) . Empty and broken particles are frequently seen. Morphologically similar viruses that cause diarrhea in young calves and infant mice share certain antigens with one another and with infantile gastroenteritis virus.7 The human virus has not been fully characterized but it is thought to be a double stranded RNA virus. It may replicate slowly in human fetal gut organ cultures. 26 Proof that this agent actually causes gastroenteritis comes from a series of observations made in various centers over the past 18 months.

Long-term carriers and animal reservoirs have not been identified. An antibody response occurs in sera of infected infants,ll and one study has shown complement fixing antibodies to be prevalent among adultsY The fact that we have not yet identified a second attack in a patient suggests that an infection may confer lasting immunity. It is difficult to determine whether breast feeding is protective for the young infant in our locality because such a small proportion of the infant population is breast fed. The virus, like the transmissible gastroenteritis agent, invades the mucosal epithelium of the upper small bowel where it has been identified in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum of villous cells. In postmortem tissue from a patient with fulminant disease, we found virus antigen throughout the small intestine, even involving the crypt regions. It is not known whether the abnormalities of epithelial migration seen in transmissible gastroenteritis occur in infantile gastroenteritis virus in- fection. In some patients, as in some pigs with transmissible gastroenteritis, marked morphological abnormalities occur with flattening of villi, irregularity and derangement of surface epithelium;I,18 in others, no lesion is demonstrable by light microscopy.18 Disaccharidase activities are diminished in proximal intestinal mucosal biopsies from infected children. Recovery is rapid with disappearance of virus from stools and duodenal juice within five to seven days and the reappearance of normal mucosal structure within four to six weeks. 1 No evidence has emerged to incriminate secondary changes in bacterial flora in the pathogenesis of this disease. To date, studies in Toronto and in Melbourne looking for known bacterial pathogens and for enterotoxinproducing strains of E. coli have been unrewardiIig. Furthermore, we have been unable to identify any abnormalities in the metabolism or conjugation of bile salts in children with acute disease. 2 Now that a specific diagnosis can be made it will be possible to define the clinical condition caused by infantile gastroenteritis virus. To date we have had sufficient experience to gain some impression of it. The incubation period is brief, 48 hours or less, and the disease affects the very young; we have diagnosed it as early as four days of life. D sually the first manifestation is vomiting followed by watery diarrhea, cramps, and low-grade fever, a similar sequence to that observed in young piglets after transmissible gastroenteritis infection. Diarrhea is aggravated by feeding and relieved by fasting; it lasts longer than the vomiting but usually settles within four days after which recovery is rapid. The disease may be fulminant with rapid progression to dehydration, collapse and death. There have been at least five fatalities from infantile gastroenteritis virus infection in our community within the past four months in which infants died before they received medical care. If the child survives the acute illness, as in transmissible gastroenteritis, recovery is complete and chronic symptoms are rare.",
