The recent anthrax-related bioterrorist events and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) further underscore the importance of rapid diagnostics for early, informed decision-making related to patient triage, infection control, treatment, and vaccination with life-and-death consequences for patients, health providers, and the public.3, 4, 5 Unfortunately, despite the recognition that outcomes from infectious illnesses are directly associated with time to pathogen identification, conventional hospital laboratories remain encumbered by traditional, slow multistep culture-based assays, which preclude application of diagnostic test results in the acute and critical-care settings. Other limitations of the conventional laboratory include extremely prolonged assay times for fastidious pathogens (up to several weeks); requirements for additional testing and wait times for characterising detected pathogens (ie, discernment of species, strain, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance); diminished test sensitivity for patients who have received antibiotics; and inability to culture certain pathogens in disease states associated with microbial infection.2, 6\n",

The benefits of conservative management may be offset, however, by added costs and potential iatrogenic complications associated with unnecessary treatment and hospitalisations, as well as increased rates of antimicrobial resistance.7, 8, 9 A rapid reliable diagnostic assay, which allows for accurate identification of infected patients and informed early therapeutic intervention, would thus be invaluable for emergency and critical care physicians.",

As molecular diagnostics continue to flow from bench to bedside, clinicians must acquire a working knowledge of the principles, diagnostic value, and limitations of varied assays.13 Here we discuss the most promising molecular diagnostic techniques for infectious diseases in hospital-based settings: the emphasis is on PCR-based methods since they have reached greatest maturity; existing assays, current, and future applications are described. Further, a framework for describing limitations that have been encountered, as well as speculation regarding the potential effect of these developments from the patient, physician, hospital, and societal perspective is provided.",

By contrast with traditional culture-based methods of microbial identification, which rely on phenotypic characteristics, this molecular fingerprinting technique relies on sequence-based hybridisation chemistry, which confers greater specificity to pathogen identification. Direct detection of target microbial DNA in clinical samples also eliminates the need for cultivation, drastically reducing the time required for reporting of results. In 1980, the description of DNA hybridising probes for detecting enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in stool samples raised hopes that nucleic-acid-based technologies would eventually replace traditional culture techniques.17 Since that time, however, a more restrained approach has been adopted due to recognition of technical limitations of the methodology; most notably, the large amount of starting target DNA required for analysis, which results in poor detection sensitivity.18\n",

The method relies on knowing at least partial sequences of the target DNA a priori and using them to design oligonucleotide primers that hybridise specifically to the target sequences. In PCR, the target DNA is copied by a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme, in the presence of nucleotides and primers. Through multiple cycles of heating and cooling in a thermocycler to produce rounds of target DNA denaturation, primer hybridisation, and primer extension, the target DNA is amplified exponentially (figure 1\n). Theoretically, this method has the potential to generate billions of copies of target DNA from a single copy in less than 1 h.

For purposes of clinical applicability, this process represents a major breakthrough since it eliminates the need for laborious post-amplification processing (ie, gel electrophoresis) conventionally needed for amplicon detection, and allows for measurement of product simultaneous with DNA synthesis. One approach for real-time monitoring of amplicon production is to use fluorescent DNA intercalating dyes, such as SYBR-Green I, which bind non-specifically to double-stranded DNA generated during amplification.29 A more popular alternative approach is to use a fluorescent-labelled internal DNA probe which specifically anneals within the target amplification region. The choice of probe format depends on the compatibility of its hybridisation chemistry with the experimental design. Variations in probe format include TaqMan (Applied Biosystems; figure 2\n), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and molecular beacon probes.30, 31, 32 Regardless of the format chosen, the internal probe emits a fluorescent signal during each amplification cycle only in the presence of target sequences, with signal intensity increasing in proportion to the amount of amplified products generated. The amount of starting templates in a specimen can be quantified by comparing the exact cycle number at which amplified products accumulate significantly over baseline with a pre-derived quantitative standard. Development of automated instrumentation with quantitative capacity insures reproducibility. Practical advantages of real-time PCR over conventional PCR are thus myriad and include speed, simplicity, reproducibility, and quantitative capacity.",

Two PCR-based assays are approved by the FDA for direct detection of M tuberculosis from clinical specimens (table 1). Although these assays result in significant improvements in time to diagnosis, the only FDA approved use at this time is as a diagnostic adjunct to the conventional smear and culture. Nonetheless, recent studies suggest that more widespread use of these assays may significantly affect patient management, clinical outcomes, and cost efficacy.56, 57 Potential yet unrealised applications of the assay for use in acute-care settings include earlier informed decision-making for appropriate use of isolation beds in high prevalence sites, regional outbreaks, or where isolation beds are scarce. The use of this and other PCR-based diagnostics in these settings, however, will have to be balanced against costs, expertise, and time associated with routine around-the-clock availability of testing, as discussed in more detail below.",

Testing and application of a PCR assay for enteroviral meningitis has been seen to be highly sensitive.63, 64 With reporting of results within 1 day, preliminary clinical trials have shown significant decreases in hospital costs due to decreased duration of hospital stays and courses of antibiotic therapy.65, 66 Other viral PCR assays, now routinely available, include those for herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis viruses, and HIV.67 Each has a proven cost-saving role in clinical practice, including detection of otherwise difficult to diagnose infections, and a newly realised capacity to monitor progression of disease and response to therapy, vital to the management of chronic infectious diseases.68\n",

Clinical applications are profound. Acute-care physicians could rapidly identify the presence of bacteraemia. Previous empiric decision-making could be abandoned in favour of educated practice, allowing appropriate, expeditious decision-making about the need for antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation. In principle, this approach could be applied to other taxonomic groups of pathogens (eg, genus of species, families of viruses, or fungi) by exploiting common features of classes of organisms for broad-range PCR assay design.72\n",

The sample volume most PCR assays can accommodate is quite small relative to the volume used in conventional culture methods; as such, in cases in which the concentration of infectious organisms is low, the assay may yield false-negative findings. To account for this, DNA extraction and purification steps are usually performed before PCR amplification as a means of concentrating total DNA from a larger sample volume. Additional methods to optimise starting concentration of target DNA for the PCR reaction include: selecting specimen sources (eg, cerebrospinal fluid) or specimen fractions (eg, buffy coat instead of whole blood) with the highest abundance of microbial DNA for the DNA extraction; briefly cultivating samples to increase microbial load before DNA extraction;20 or introducing specific capture probes to concentrate only microbial DNA in a given sample.111 Several sample processing obstacles may also lead to false-negative findings. Three of the most commonly encountered problems are (1) inadequate removal of PCR inhibitors in the sample, such as haemoglobin, blood culture media, urine, and sputum; (2) ineffective release of microbial DNA content from the cells; or (3) poor DNA recovery after extraction and purification steps. Methods to ensure best sample processing include: incorporating internal amplification controls (eg, the human \u03b2-globin gene) to the PCR assay to monitor for presence of both purified sample DNA as well as potential PCR inhibitors;112 and inducing various chaotropic, enzymatic, or thermal methods of cell lysis to effectively liberate microbial DNA content.20 Because of the varying effectiveness of each of these measures, efforts to improve an assay's detection sensitivity may need to be individually adjusted based on the assay's clinical application and the microbial pathogen of interest.",

The ability to interface with high throughput PCR systems is already seen in many new automated extraction instruments. Technical limitations of most PCR instruments to run overlapping reactions in parallel have restricted analyses to batches, thereby compromising the assay's overall turnaround time. However, with the new generation of thermocycler (eg, SmartCycler, Cepheid), separate PCR reactions, each with a unique set of cycling protocols and data analysis, can now be done simultaneously. Furthermore, the recent introduction of hand-held battery-operated real-time PCR instruments (BioSeeq, Smiths Detection-Edgewood BioSeeq) is the latest iteration of the moving trend from laboratory to near patient testing.150 Ultimately, as \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d technologies mature, routine point-of-care testing will be realised.",

Institutional resources, manpower issues, and cost effectiveness also have to be carefully considered when making decisions about the practicalities of replacing traditional diagnostic methodologies.

A universally reliable infectious disease diagnostic system will certainly become a fundamental tool in the evolving diagnostic armamentarium of the 21st century clinician. For front-line acute care physicians, or physicians working in disaster settings, a quick universal PCR assay, or panels of PCR assays targeting categories of pathogens involved in specific syndromes such as meningitis, pneumonia, or sepsis, would allow for rapid triage and early aggressive targeted therapy. Resources could thus be appropriately applied, and patients with suspected infections rapidly risk-stratified to the different treatment settings, depending on the pathogen and virulence. The ability to discern species and subtype would allow for more precise decision-making regarding antimicrobial agents. Patients who are colonised with highly contagious pathogens could be appropriately isolated on entry into the medical setting without delay. Targeted therapy would diminish development of antibiotic resistance, because the identification of antibiotic-resistant strains would permit precise pharmacological intervention. Both physicians and patients would benefit from less repetitive testing and elimination of wait times for traditional laboratory results. Furthermore, links with data management systems, locally, regionally, and nationally, would allow for effective epidemiological surveillance with obvious benefits for antibiotic selection and control of disease outbreaks.",
