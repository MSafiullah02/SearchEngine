            "text": "Because aerosol particles remain suspended in air, pathogens transmitted via airborne route can spread across hospital floors and across long distances. Therefore, physical space and engineering controls such as proper ventilation; air handling including air exchanges and air flow management, i.e., negative pressure air flow; and high-efficiency particulate filtration are the cornerstone for preventing airborne transmission. Measures such as ultraviolet lights are also effective when used as an adjunct. Portable HEPA filters can also be used in certain situations. When combined with appropriate use of respiratory protection, airborne transmission can be prevented effectively. Physical space controls gained particular importance in recent years as research into transmission of emerging pathogens such as coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) and influenza viruses (e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza) identified potential for airborne transmission. A complete discussion of physical space and engineering controls is beyond the scope of this chapter.",

            "text": "PAPRs do not require fit testing and are not affected by facial hair. They have a higher assigned protection factor and therefore useful in high-hazard situations. Patients can see the wearer\u2019s face, and they are easier for communication than an N95 respirator. Reusable respiratory protection equipment has advantages when dealing with pandemic events of potential airborne transmission (such as pandemic influenza or spread of coronavirus such as MERS). In the setting of a pandemic, it is likely that a very large volume of disposable N95 masks would be required to provide protection to every healthcare worker (including not only physicians and nurses but also any other individual, paid or not, who may share air space with individuals with potentially infections transmitted through the airborne route). In these situations, reusable equipment may be more advantageous. They have the disadvantages of being heavy to wear, interfering with stethoscope use, being noisy and sometimes making communication difficult, needing batteries or electricity, and potential for contamination with infectious material, thereby requiring decontamination and reprocessing between uses [8]. There are also theoretical concerns about how PAPRs may affect the wearer\u2019s performance. Some of this data comes from nonmedical use of respirators. Visual acuity may decrease, up to 75% in some reports, and visual range may be diminished. More concerning is the potential impact on steadiness and even cognitive impairment (although most studies have failed to prove this) during use due to thermal burden (when temperature rises over 85 \u00b0F, there is decreased reaction time, and this correlates with unsafe work behaviors) especially in hot environments [9\u201312]. A study performed by AlGhamri et al. [13] found no cognitive impairment in individuals using N95 or PAPRs while performing predetermined tasks but found a negative effect in cognitive function when using negative pressure, full-face respirators. This study was limited by a small sample size and the lack of experience with respirator use by many of the studied subjects. A previous study showed that the use of a PAPR was associated with a potential decline in speech intelligibility, but this did not reach statistical significance when compared to other respiratory protection equipment or no respiratory protection at all. Even though full-face PAPRs do not require fit testing, they need to be properly size fitted. PAPRs are not exempt from limitations in their capacity to protect individuals when they are not properly size fitted. Gao et al. evaluated the level of protection provided by a PAPR in manikins, using different sizes of full-face masks. They found decreased protection when the manikins were not fitted with a properly sized full-face mask [12].",

            "text": "Baracco et al. developed a model to evaluate the cost of three options for respiratory protection requiring airborne isolation in the setting of a severe airborne pandemic event [14]. They compared the cost of stockpiling N95 masks, PAPRs, and reusable elastomeric half-face respirator. They took into account the storage space required, the half-life of the equipment, and the maintenance required, in the setting of a massive event requiring about six million contacts per one million population during the pandemic event. They based their model on assumptions derived from the 1918 influenza pandemic event. They found that the cost of stockpiling PAPRs is likely to be higher than the stockpiling of N95 masks, given the need not only of storage but also maintenance and battery care. Most batteries lose charging capacity over time and need to be replaced. Disposable batteries usually have a longer half-life, but only 10 h of battery life, and are more expensive. These batteries are usually made for the equipment, and regular batteries are not usually utilized. PAPRs need a larger storing area, need to be cleaned between uses, and the batteries expire, requiring battery recharging stations within reasonable access from the patient care areas. They are also more expensive, with each PAPR causing upwards of $1000.",

The cost of each mask is $0.73. For an organization that needs to fit test 5000 persons per year, the direct costs would be close to $100,000 per year.

The plan must detail methods for controlling exposure to aerosol transmissible pathogens are airborne isolation to minimize the number of employees exposed, minimize the amount of infectious aerosol in the air through placement of mask on a patient and use of closed suctioning systems to minimize dispersion of aerosol, and protecting employees who must be exposed through vaccination if available, and use of personal protective equipment.",

The OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134 requires that employers establish and maintain a respiratory protection program for workplaces in which workers may be exposed to respiratory hazards, and respiratory protection is used as an exposure control method. The OSHA recommends a hierarchy of controls \u2013 prevention or substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and work practices, and, lastly, respiratory protection/personal protective equipment. One of the OSHA requirements is that the employer makes available respiratory protection gear in any workplace where respiratory protection may be required. This includes the presence of a program to select the type of respirators, ensure its proper maintenance, employee fitting if tight-fitting respirators are used, use during potential emergencies, cleaning/storage/maintenance of the respiratory protection equipment, training of employees on respirator use, risks of exposures, and evaluation of effectiveness of the program. It is required that respirators are fitted. The standard requires employees to be fit tested prior to the initial use of a respirator, annually, and whenever a different respirator facepiece (size, style, model, or make) is used. Furthermore, personal protective equipment must be provided at no cost to the employee.",

            "text": "Professionals in infection control and occupational health , as well as hospital administrators, need to be knowledgeable about and comply with regulations governing respiratory protection programs in their respective hospitals. While OSHA stipulates federal standards that are followed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and most organizations, the Joint Commission requires that each healthcare facility clearly outlines elements of their respiratory protection program in their policies and procedures and demonstrates compliance [15]. Furthermore, there is considerable variation among states and organizations, especially those which are public, county-owned, or state-owned teaching institutions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthcare facilities follow their respective federal, state, or local regulations as it is not a regulatory agency [17]. It is important to know these nuances. Studies show that hospitals are experiencing challenges with the implementation of their respiratory protection programs. Twenty-four states have state-approved OSHA plans. These state-level plans incorporate regulations that are at least as strict as those set forth by OSHA at the federal level. In August 2009, during the peak of H1N1 pandemic, California enacted the nation\u2019s first occupational standard for aerosol transmissible diseases [18]. The standard requires, among other things, that hospitals care for patients with pandemic influenza using respiratory protection that includes an N95 respirator at a minimum. In addition to variation in state-level plans, recent studies in Minnesota, Illinois, and New York have demonstrated a wide variation in interpretation and implementation at the hospital level [19, 20].",

This is particularly true in healthcare facilities with a very low incidence of TB, and many such facilities are currently moving toward a PAPR-only approach for ongoing respiratory protection. This PAPR-only approach may not work in facilities with a high incidence of TB and a high volume of patients unless a seamless process for availability of PAPRs, cleaning and disinfection between uses, a maintenance plan, operational ownership plan, and training plan are fully established. In these facilities, a combination approach with N95 masks and PAPRs may be appropriate.",

Experts note that \u201cgiven the high cost per unit, PAPR availability will always be a problem in the event of a major outbreak or act of bioterrorism. Health care facilities need to have dual systems for N95 respirators and PAPRs, and they need to train health care workers to use both\u201d [8]. Studies have found that stockpiling PAPRs was the most expensive strategy for a pandemic scenario. Furthermore, respirators do not eliminate the need for negatively pressured rooms or ultraviolet lights or the costs associated with triage and screening in pandemic situations. Therefore, for pandemic situations, a combination approach is probably better, and the proportion of N95 vs. PAPR needs to be customized per the local needs of the hospital.",
