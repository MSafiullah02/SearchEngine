RTFQ-PCR can more quickly, accurately definite pathogenic species, and has important significance for the treatment and prognosis (Drago et al., 2004; Kawada et al., 2004) . It is a pity that the specific fluorescent primers can only be customized by commercial companies with high cost and one test for a virus. However, multiplex RT-PCR achieved the target that one specimen one test can simultaneously test various viruses or different types of one virus (Quereda et al., 2000) , which has the advantages of low cost, simple operation, larger information and so on.

Likewise, if a mosquito-borne virus (e.g., JEV) is identified, then extra effort can be put into mosquito control to prevent additional cases. How to develop an economic, efficient, fast and reliable diagnostic method has become an important subject for doctors from a public health standpoint.
