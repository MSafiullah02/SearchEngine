The target of COVID-2019, angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2), is expressed in the heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder and ileum as well as the alveoli.1 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has many similarities to COVID-2019 and has been shown in an animal model to mediate myocardial inflammation and damage through down-regulation of myocardial ACE2. Direct effects of SARS-CoV on the myocardium may have been responsible for adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS2 and the myocardium may be directly affected by COVID-2019.1 Recently, two case reports from China3 and Italy4 have found that COVID-2019 could cause fulminant myocarditis, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia. But whether acute cardiac injury is common and whether it is associated with death is still unclear. We thus undertook a systemic search of the literature for evidence of cardiac injury among individuals infected with COVID-2019.",

Then, separate meta-analysis was carried out, with SMD using for troponin (troponin I and T, or high sensitivity troponin I and T), and weighted mean differences (WMD) for other biomarkers. Summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were estimated for the association between acute cardiac injury and death. The degree of heterogeneity was assessed using the I2-index. An I2 statistic was considered to reflect low likelihood (0%\u201325%), moderate likelihood (26%\u201375%), and high likelihood (76%\u2013100%) of differences beyond chance, as was a p value, from a Q test of heterogeneity, of less than or equal to 0.05.6 If the results were homogeneous (I2 < 50% and p > 0.05), fixed effects models were utilized, whereas if these results were heterogeneous (I2 \u2265 50% or p \u2264 0.05), then random effect models were used. If only median and interquartile range (Q25, Q75) were reported, then we assumed the median was equal to the mean and that the standard deviation (SD) was (Q75-Q25)/2. We also conducted meta-regression to assess whether severity differences in cardiac injury biomarkers were modified by patient characteristics: age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, history of cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, chronic kidney disease, and severity definitions of COVID-19. In this meta-regression analysis cardiac injury biomarkers are selected with priority troponin>CK-MB > myogloblin>NT-proBNP for each study, for example if one study reported troponin and CK-MB, we used troponin as the outcome and used the standard mean difference model to combine the results. Evidence of publication bias was examined using Egger's regression test for funnel asymmetry, in addition to visual inspection of the funnel plots. Combined means of hsTroponin I and NT-proBNP were calculated as the sum, over studies, of the mean value of the biomarker and n is the number of participants. Data were summarised using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis and a 2-sided p value of less than or equal to 0.05 was deemed significant. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata, version 15.1.",
