Nevertheless, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for the potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density and age structure). Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of noassociation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.",

This epidemiological study assessed the global linkage between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality. Signals of BCG effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. This study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.",

BCG vaccination of newborns and infants prevents disseminated childhood TB and reduces the risk of pulmonary TB by about 50% (6) . Even though the BCG vaccine has been in use for more than 90 years, with proven safety, its efficacy is still controversial (7) . BCG vaccination has shown clear protection in children, but in adults its effects have been inconsistent (8) . Many countries initiated national BCG vaccination in the middle of the twentieth century with variable levels of coverage using different BCG strains (9), number of doses, and delivery method (10) . As the prevalence of TB decreased, countries like France, Germany, and Spain stopped mass vaccination of children and moved to vaccinate only individuals at high risk. Other countries like Russia, Portugal, and China have continued national BCG vaccination to date. Some countries never established national universal BCG vaccination, including the United States and Italy, and only target high-risk individuals (10) For many decades, the innate immune response was thought to be hardwired and unable to adapt and \"learn\" from previous exposure to a pathogen. In the last ten years several studies demonstrated that the priming or \"training\" of the innate immune system is an ancient response observed in evolutionary distant organisms including plants (11) , insects (12) , and humans (13) .",

            "text": "There is also ample epidemiological evidence that BCG vaccination has broad protective effects that are not specific to M. tuberculosis infection. For example, in 1927, Swedish children who received BCG vaccination at birth had a mortality rate almost threefold lower than unvaccinated children that could not be explained by TB infection, and thus early on, it was suggested that the very low mortality among BCG vaccinated children may be caused by nonspecific immunity (18) . In West Africa, a BCG vaccination scar and a positive tuberculin reaction were associated with better survival during early childhood in an area with high mortality; this was not observed with other childhood vaccines (19) . A general reduction in neonatal mortality was also reported in children from Guinea-Bissau, mainly due to fewer cases of neonatal sepsis, respiratory infection, and fever (20) . The BCG vaccine appears to confer broad enhanced immunity to respiratory infections, as infants from Guinea-Bissau with acute viral infections of the lower respiratory tract were more likely to not have received BCG vaccination than matched controls (21) . In Spain, hospitalizations due to respiratory infections in 0-14 year-old children not attributable to TB, were significantly lower in BCG-vaccinated compared to non-BCG-vaccinated children (22) . The observation that this protection was still present in 14 year-old children suggests that the broad protective effect of BCG can be longlasting. Taken together, our current understanding of broad immune protection mediated by trained immunity and the epidemiologic evidence of long-lasting protection from viral infections of the respiratory tract, conferred by BCG vaccination, offers a rational biological basis for the potential protective effect of BCG vaccination from severe COVID-19.",

Number of deaths are also a good proxy of epidemic size during explosive epidemics, considering that often the number of cases is underreported due to overwhelmed and unprepared health systems (i.e., surveillance fatigue) (28) . We developed statistics tests (i.e., ANOVA, t-test, linear regression, normality probability) (29) to determine linkages between use of BCG vaccine and number of COVID-19 deaths (\u03b1=0.05). BCG vaccination data were collected at the country level based on policy of vaccination (i.e., current, interrupted, never) (10) and the mean and median percentage of vaccination coverage during the periods 1980-1985 and 1980-2018 (30) . COVID-19-related deaths were collected until April 23, 2020 and were standardized by population and stage of the epidemic (31) . Independent (i.e., with vs. without BCG vaccination, policy of BCG vaccination in place, percentage of vaccine coverage) and dependent variables (i.e., mean, median, and maximum deaths per million) were compared using data at specific times of each country's epidemic since the first death (e.g., first month, week-three, middle, full period).

We found that COVID-19 mortality in the states of New York, Illinois, Alabama, and Florida (unvaccinated) was significantly higher (t(237)=14.274, p<0.001) than states from BCG-vaccinated countries (Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo in Brazil; Mexico State and Mexico City in Mexico) (Fig. 3A, left panel) . This is remarkable, considering that the three States from Latin America have much higher population density than the North American states analyzed, including New York (Fig. 3A, right panel) . Because of the differences in latitude, one can envision that differences in climate could be responsible for the lower mortality in southern countries. However, one must consider that the average temperature in the month of March in Mexico City (62.2\u00b0F) and Sao Paulo (64.4 \u00b0F) is lower than in Florida (69.9 \u00b0F) or Louisiana (66.3\u00b0F), and that there is preliminary evidence for lack of temperature-dependence for the COVID-19 epidemic, based on data from China (32) .",

To give these differences a quantitative value, a BCG vaccination index was developed by multiplying the age of the older group that was vaccinated (because COVID-19 mortality increases by age) by the number of years that a program was maintained. We found a significant (r 2 =0.44, p<0.0001) negative correlation between BCG index and COVID-19 mortality in European countries that administer the BCG vaccine to infants by intradermal injection (Fig.   4C ). In this analysis, the United Kingdom was excluded because it administered the vaccine to older children (12-13 years old) (10) , and France because it administered the vaccine to infants and young children going to daycare, or to children of school age (40). We noted that COVID-19 mortality was higher in the United Kingdom and France compared to Germany, Scandinavia, or Eastern European countries (Fig. 5A ).",

The augmented COVID-19 mortality in developed countries when compared to developing countries remained consistent even after correcting for social confounding factors and age. There are several important social differences between eastern and western German states, such as lower GDP in former East Germany, and higher percentage of population 65 or older in eastern states (24%) than in western ones (21%) (38) , but it is hard to envision how these factors could decrease their risk of COVID-19 fatality in eastern German states. One should consider that the difference in mortality could also be explained, at least in part, by the lower population density in East Germany (154/Km 2 ) than in West Germany (282/Km 2 ).

Considering the remarkable dissemination capacity and the mortality rates of COVID-19, vaccination capable of conferring even transient protection (e.g., 6 -12 months) may be useful in individuals at high risk, such as health workers, first responders, and police officers, or those with pre-existing conditions such as obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. Similarly, even improved unspecific cellular immunity through BCG vaccination in vulnerable age groups could ameliorate severe COVID-19.
