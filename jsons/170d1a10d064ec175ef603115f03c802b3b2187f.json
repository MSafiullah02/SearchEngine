Since the beginning of the century, the 2001 anthrax attacks in the USA and subsequent hoaxes as well as the global SARS outbreak and in fl uenza pandemic threats have all contributed to raise public awareness about health emergencies, leading authorities to adapt and improve planning for such events. This chapter focuses on natural and intentional public health threats and on biopreparedness from a French perspective, describing legal and organizational frameworks, plans and guidelines.",

As the European Security Strategy identi fi es threats facing the European Union, the French White Paper on defence and national security (2008) identi fi es a number of threats and vulnerabilities for France and its citizens. Among these are weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and emerging health risks, and the issue of the rising number of French citizens living abroad. Other identi fi ed vulnerabilities are ballistic and missile threats, major attacks against information systems, new and robust espionage activities, major criminal networks, natural catastrophes, as well as industrial disasters and technological risks. The strategy also integrates four new security parameters: the growing interconnection between threats and risks resulting from globalization, continuity between domestic and foreign security, the possibility of sudden strategic disruptions, as well as developments impacting military operations.",

In addition, development of drug resistant strains is a public health challenge. Emerging carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are for example considered worrisome, even if few cases have been detected in France until now. The 2010 Bulletin Epid\u00e9miologique Hebdomadaire (BEH) about surveillance assessments of infectious diseases, published by InVS, also underlines the risk of introduction of chikungunya and dengue viruses by travelers arriving or returning from endemic areas, as a potential vector (a mosquito, Aedes albopictus ) is now present in Southeastern France. In 2008, according to Inserm -C\u00e9piDc data, mortality caused by infectious and parasitic diseases represented 2% of the deaths in France.",

According to 2010 InVS epidemiological data, there are also few cases of tularemia, the reporting of which became mandatory in 2002. Reporting of anthrax cases has been mandatory since 2003, but cases are extremely rare with only one imported case (2003) and three patients infected with cutaneous anthrax (2008) reported in the last decade [ 5 ] . Regarding plague, the last cases occurred in 1945. However, this disease is endemic in some areas in Africa and Asia that have close links to France. As for viral hemorrhagic fevers, most cases in metropolitan France are caused by Puumala virus (Hantavirus), responsible for a relatively mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptoms, and yellow fever (Arbovirus) for which vaccination is mandatory to travel to French Guiana. No case of African hemorrhagic fever has been identi fi ed in France since the inclusion of these diseases on the mandatory reporting list, however, the risk of importation must not be ignored.",
