            "text": "Mid-course corrections during implementation of prevention programs targeted to families with young children have long been seen as important ways to refine and modify the roles of program staff working with these populations and add formal and informal supports to ongoing implementation and service delivery prior to final evaluation (Lynch et al. 1998; Wandersman et al. 1998). Mid-course corrections can help implementers in current interventions or programs adopt a more facilitative and individualized approach to participants that can improve implementation fidelity and cohesion (Lynch et al. 1998; Sobeck et al. 2006). Comprehensive reviews of implementation of programs for families with young children have consistently found that well-measured implementation improves program outcomes significantly, especially when dose or service duration is also assessed (Durlak and DuPre 2008; Fixsen et al. 2005). Numerous studies have emphasized capturing implementation data at a low enough level to be able to use it to improve service data quickly and hit the right balance of implementation fidelity and thoughtful, intentional implementation adaptation (Durlak and DuPre 2008; Schoenwald et al. 2010; Schoenwald et al. 2013; Schoenwald and Hoagwood 2001; Tucker et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Inter-organizational networks serving families with young children face special challenges in making mid-course corrections while maintaining implementation fidelity across member organizations (Aarons et al. 2011; Hanf and O\u2019Toole 1992). Implementation through inter-organizational networks is never merely a result of clear success or clear failure; rather, it is an ongoing assessment of how organizational actors are cooperating or not across organizational boundaries (Cline 2000). Frambach and Schillewaert (2002) echo this point by noting that intra-organizational and individual cooperation, consistency, and variance also have strong effects on the eventual level of implementation cohesion and fidelity that a given project is able to reach. Moreover, recent research suggests that while funders and networks may emphasize and prefer inter-organizational collaboration, individual agency managers in collaborating organizations may see risks and consequences of collaboration and may face dilemmas in complying with network or funder expectations (Bunger et al. 2017). Similar organizations providing similar services with overlapping client bases may fear opportunism or poaching from collaborators, and interpersonal trust as well as contracts or memoranda of understanding might be needed to assuage these concerns (Bunger 2013; Bunger et al. 2017). Even successful collaboration may expedite mergers between collaborating organizations that are undesired or disruptive to stakeholders and sectors (Bunger 2013). While funders may often prefer to fund larger and more comprehensive merged organizations, smaller specialized community organizations founded by and for marginalized populations may struggle to maintain their community connection and focus as subordinate components of larger firms (Bunger 2013).",

Fischhoff (1989) notes that in the public health workforce, individual workers rarely know how to organize their work to anticipate the possibility or likelihood of mid-course corrections because most work is habituated and routinized to the point that it is rarely intentionally changed, and when it is changed, it is due to larger issues on which workers expect extensive further guidance. When a need for even a relatively minor mid-course correction is identified, it can result in everyone concerned \u201clooking bad,\u201d from the workers adapting their implementation to the organizations requesting the changes (Fischhoff 1989, p. 112). There is also some evidence that health workers have surprisingly stable, pre-existing beliefs about their work situations and experiences, and requests to make mid-course corrections in work situations may have to contend with workers\u2019 pre-existing, stable beliefs about the program they are implementing no matter how well-reasoned the proposed course corrections are (Harris and Daniels 2005). Given a new emphasis in social work that organizational policy advocacy should be re-conceptualized as part of everyday organizational practice (Mosley 2013), a special focus on strategies that contribute to the success of professional networks and organizations that can leverage influence beyond that of a single agency becomes increasingly important.",

Evidence suggests that behavior in many contexts is easy to predict with high accuracy, and behavioral economics seeks to alter people\u2019s behavior in predictable, honest, and ethical ways without forbidding any options or significantly adding too-costly incentives, so that the best or healthiest choice is the easiest choice (Thaler and Sunstein 2008).",

This study also used ethnographic methods such participant observation and informal, unstructured interview conversations at regularly scheduled meetings. Adding these ethnographic approaches to a case study which is tightly time-limited can help answer research questions fully and efficiently (Fusch et al. 2017). Data were collected at regular network meetings, which are 2\u20133 h long and held twice a month. One meeting is a large group of about 30 participants who supervise or perform screening and case management for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders as well as local practitioners in quality improvement and workforce training and development. A second executive meeting was held with 8\u201312 participants, typically network staff and the two co-chairs of each of organized three groups, a screening and referral group, a workforce training group, and a quality improvement group, to debrief and discuss major issues reported at the large group meeting.",

These network meetings generally used a world caf\u00e9 focus group method, in which participants move from a large group to several small groups discussing screening and referral, training, and quality improvement specifically, then moved back to report small group findings to the large group (Fouch\u00e9 and Light 2011). The author typed extensive notes on an iPad, and note-taking during small group breakouts could only intermittently capture content due to the roving nature of the world caf\u00e9 model. Note-taking was typically unobtrusive because virtually all participants in both small and large group meetings took notes on discussion. Note-taking and note-sharing were also a frequent and iterative process, in which the author commonly forwarded the notes taken at each meeting to network staff and group participants after each meeting to gain their insights and help construct the agenda of the next meeting. By the middle of the program year, network participants had gotten to know each other and the author quite well, so the author was typically able to easily arrange additional conversations for purposes of member checking. These informal meetings supplemented the two regular monthly meetings of the network and allowed for specific follow-up in which participants were asked about specific comments and reactions they had shared at previous meetings.",

The author then coded the author\u2019s meeting notes in an iterative and sequenced process guided by principles of qualitative description, in which the goal of data analysis is to summarize and report an event using the ordinary, everyday terms for that event and the unique descriptions of those present (Sandelowski and Leeman 2012). This analytic method was chosen because it is especially useful when interviewing health professionals about a specific topic, in that interpretation stays very close to the data presented while leveraging all of the methodological strengths of qualitative research, such as multiple, iterative coding, member checking, and data triangulation (Neergaard et al. 2009). In this way, qualitative organizational research remains rigorous, while the significance of findings is easily translated to wider audiences for rapid action in intervention and implementation (Sandelowski and Leeman 2012).",

First, several noted that patients commonly experience inconsistent providers during perinatal care and may have little incentive to follow up on referrals after such a fragmented experience. One participant noted a patient who had been diagnosed with preeclampsia (a pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure) by her first provider, but the diagnostician gave no further information beyond stating the diagnosis, and then the numerous other providers this patient saw never mentioned it again. This patient moved through care knowing nothing about her diagnosis and with little incentive to accept or follow up with other referrals. Other participants noted that the typical approach to discharge planning and care transitions by providers was a poor match for clean, universal screening and referral, and that satisfaction surveys had captured patient concerns about how they were given information, which was typically on paper and presented to the patient as she leaves the hospital or medical office. As one participant noted, \u201cWe flood them the day mom leaves the hospital and we\u2019re lucky if the paper ever gets out of the back seat of the car.\u201d Others noted that patients may not follow up on referrals simply because they are feeling overwhelmed with other areas of life or are feeling emotionally better without further treatment.",

All screening tools used numeric scores, so that triggered referrals were not dependent on staff having to decide independently to make a referral, but conveying the difficult news that a client had scored high enough on a depression scale to warrant a follow-up referral may have been daunting to some staff. An alternative explanation suggested that staff were not ignoring positive screens but were not understanding the intricacies and expectations of the screening process. Of the community agencies partnering with the network to provide screening, many were also able to provide case management as well, but staff did not realize that internal referrals to a different part of their agency still needed to be documented. In this case, a number of missed referrals could have been provided but never documented in the network data-sharing system.",

One participant noted that the elusive warm handoff\u2014a discharge and referral where the patient was warmly engaged, clearly understood the expected next steps, and was motivated to visit the recommended provider for further treatment\u2014was also challenging for staff who might default to a \u201cjust hand them the paper\u201d mindset, especially for those staff who were overwhelmed and understaffed. The network was funding additional case managers to link patients to treatment, but partner agencies were expected to screen using usual staff, who had been trained but not increased or otherwise compensated to do the screening. Additional concerns mentioned the knowledge and preparation of staff to make good referrals, with an example noted of one staff member seemingly unaware of how to make a domestic violence referral even through a locally well-known agency specializing in interpersonal violence treatment and prevention has been working with the network for some time. Meeting participants agreed that in the time remaining for the screening and referral pilot, advocacy efforts would have to be diverted away from senior executives and toward line staff if there was to be any chance of meeting enrollment targets and justifying further funding for the screening and referral program.",

This suggested that additional advocacy at the executive level might still be needed, as executives could lead their agencies out of the network screening system after June 30, but that for the remainder of the program year, the line staff themselves who were performing screening needed to be heavily engaged and lobbied to have any hope of fully completing the pilot program on time.",

Visual charts and graphs displaying successful screenings and enrollments while also emphasizing the remaining screenings and enrollments needed to be on schedule were chosen for further training because these tactics would involve virtually no additional cost to partner agencies and could be implemented immediately. Likewise, shifting to \u201copt-out\u201d enrollment procedures was encouraged, where referred patients would be automatically enrolled in case management unless they specifically objected. In addition, the network quickly scheduled a workshop on how to facilitate meetings so that supervisors in partner agencies would be assisted in immediately discussing and implementing the above course corrections and behavioral strategies with their staff.",

First, it was important to make sure that enrollment goals were always visually displayed in the work area of staff performing screening and enrollment work. This could be something as simple as a hand-drawn sign in the work area noting how many patients had been enrolled compared with what that week\u2019s enrollment target was. Ideally this technique would transition to an infographic that was connected to an electronic dashboard in real time\u2014where results would be transparently displayed for all to see in an automatic way that did not take additional staff time to maintain. Second, the visual incentive needed to be displayed vividly enough to alter or motivate new worker behavior, but not so vividly as to compete with, distract, or delay new worker behavior. In many social work settings, participants agreed that weekly updates are intuitive for most staff. Without regular check-in\u2019s and updates of the target numbers, it could be easy for workers to lose their sense of urgency about meeting these time-constrained goals. Third, training emphasized teaching staff how behavioral biases could reduce their effectiveness. Many staff are used to (and often good at) cramming and working just-in-time, but this is not possible when staff cannot control all aspects of work. Screeners cannot control the flow of enrollees\u2014rather they must be ready to enroll new clients intermittently as soon as they see a screening is positive\u2014so re-learning not to cram or work just-in-time suggested a change in workplace routines for many staff.",

Evidence suggests that behavior in many contexts is easy to predict with high accuracy, and behavioral economics seeks to alter people\u2019s behavior in predictable, honest, and ethical ways without forbidding any options or significantly adding too-costly incentives, so that the best or healthiest choice is the easiest choice (Thaler and Sunstein 2008). Training here also emphasized meeting Thaler and Sunstein\u2019s (2008) two standards for good choice architecture: (1) the choice had to be transparent, not hidden, and (2) it had to be cheap and easy to opt out. Good examples of such choice architecture were highlighted, such as email and social media group enrollments, where one can unsubscribe and leave such a group with just one click. Bad or false examples of choice architecture were also highlighted, such as auto-renewal for magazines or memberships where due dates by which to opt out are often hidden and there is always one more financial charge before one is free of the costly enrollment or subscription. Training concluded by advising network participants to use opt-in choice architecture when the services in question are highly likely to be spam, not meaningful, or only relevant to a fraction of those approached. Attendees were advised to use opt-out choice architecture when the services in question are highly likely to be meaningful, not spam, and relevant to most of those approached. Since those with positive depression screens were not approached unless they had scored high on a depression screening, automatic enrollment in a case management service where clients would receive at least one more contact from social services was highly relevant to the population served in this pilot program and was encouraged, with clients always having the right to refuse.",

This training emphasized the importance of creating spaces for staff to express doubt or confusion about what was being asked of them. One technique that resonated with participants was doing check-ins with staff during a group training by asking staff to make \u201cfists to fives,\u201d a hand signal on a 0\u20135 scale on how comfortable they were with the discussion, where holding a fist in the air is discomfort, disagreement, or confusion and waving all five fingers of one hand in the air meant total comfort or agreement with a query or topic. Training also emphasized that facilitators and trainers should acknowledge that conflict and disagreement typically comes from really caring, so it was important to \u201cnormalize discomfort,\u201d call it out when people in the room seem uncomfortable, and reiterate that the partner agency is able and willing to have \u201cthe tough conversations\u201d about the nature of the work.",

            "text": "Research suggests that collaboration may be even more important for organizations than for individuals in the implementation of social innovations (Berzin et al. 2015). The network studied here adopted behavioral economics as a primary means of focusing organizational collaboration. However, a managerial turn to nudging or behavioral economics must do more than achieve merely administrative compliance. \u201cOpt-out, not-in\u201d organizational approaches could positively affect implementation of social programs in two ways. First, it could eliminate unnecessary implementation impediments (such as the difficult conversations about depression referrals resisted by staff in this case) by using tools such as automatic enrollment to push these conversations to more specialized staff who could better advise affected clients. Second, such approaches could reduce the potential workplace dissatisfaction of line staff, including any potential discipline they could face for incorrectly following more complicated procedures. Thaler and Sunstein (2003) explicitly endorse worker welfare as a rationale and site for behavioral economic approaches. They note that every system as a system has been planned with an array of choice decisions already made, and given that there is always a starting default, it should be set to predict desired best outcomes. This study supports considering behavioral economic approaches for social program implementation as a way to reset maladaptive default settings and provide services in ways that can be more just and more effective for both workers and clients.",
