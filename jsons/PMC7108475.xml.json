The virus was initially identified in people in Mexico and the US in March\u2013April 2009. At the time of writing, there were 1490 confirmed human cases of this novel H1N1 infection in 21 cities across many continents. Hong Kong reported its first confirmed case of this novel H1N1 virus on May 1, 2009. The severity of the human disease remains unclear, with most cases outside of Mexico having a mild clinical course. However, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the most severe influenza pandemic currently known, was also mild at the time of its initial emergence and only acquired virulence during the second wave of human disease in the winter season (3). Current mathematical model\u2013based estimates predict that a new pandemic could result in 2\u20137.4 million deaths worldwide (4).",

Some cases appear to have caused large outbreaks of local transmission (such as in New York), but many other cases have led to little or no secondary transmission. Early detection in suspected patients is crucial for containing the disease and preventing ongoing transmission. Few well-validated laboratory diagnostic methods exist for the diagnosis of this novel H1N1 infection. The WHO defines a probable clinical case as one that is confirmed by (1) specific RT-PCR\u2013based detection methods, (2) isolation of the novel H1N1 influenza virus, or (3) detection of a 4-fold rise of neutralization antibodies to this virus (5). Biosafety level (BSL)1 2 laboratories with BSL3 practices are recommended for virus isolation and serology, whereas PCR detection requires only a BSL2 environment (6). Of the above diagnostic tests, only RT-PCR\u2013based detection methods allow rapid detection of the swine-like H1N1 influenza virus within a few hours.",

FJ966082), we developed and evaluated several RT-PCR assays for the detection of this virus. We used these assays to help confirm the first case found in Hong Kong (7). Here, we describe a conventional 1-step RT-PCR and a 1-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR that can detect this novel swine-like H1N1. Because many laboratories lack the novel A/California/04/2009-like H1N1 virus for use as a positive control for these tests, we used a swine H1 virus (A/SW/HK/PHK1578/03) previously isolated in our routine swine influenza surveillance program (unpublished results) as the positive control in this study. The primers and probes were designed to perfectly match both the swine-like H1N1 and A/SW/HK/PHK1578/03. We reasoned that regions of the genome that are conserved between swine H1 viruses in Asia and the swine-like novel H1N1 virus, but distinct from human seasonal H1N1 viruses, offer several advantages as targets for a molecular diagnostic test. More importantly, we reasoned that this approach might help to minimize the shipping and handling of A/California/04/2009-like H1N1 viruses to laboratories that do not have the recommended biosafety facilities. Accidental release of the human adapted A/California/04/2009-like viruses from the laboratory poses public health concerns. The positive control Asian swine H1N1 virus (A/SW/HK/PHK1578/03), which is not adapted to human transmission, is a much safer option and is available on request.",

(C), Detection of the novel H1N1 from a clinical specimen by the conventional RT-PCR assay. +ve, positive control. (D), Detection of the novel H1N1 from a clinical specimen by the real-time RT-PCR assay. The clinical specimen was serially diluted and tested using the assay. The dilution factors used in each of these positive reactions are indicated. Delta Rn indicates the magnitude of the PCR signal.",
