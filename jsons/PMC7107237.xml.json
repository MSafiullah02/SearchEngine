Taking into consideration examples of historical diseases such as tuberculous or syphilitic aortitis, infections have long been suspected to be trigger factors for many types of vasculitis. However, a causal relationship has only been firmly established in a few instances using an epidemiological approach (e.g. PAN and HBV; cryoglobulinaemia and HCV). In most cases, however, this link remains hypothetical without formal evidence. The physiopathology of this inter-relationship remains poorly understood.",

Recently, antibodies such as ANCA and/or some key components of apoptosis have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of various types of vasculitis in animal models. An important contribution to this field has been the use of a mouse model of ANCA-associated vasculitis [2]. Huugen et al. [2] used a model of passive transfer of anti-MPO antibodies prepared in MPO knock-out mice. They transferred the anti-MPO IgG to na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice (control mice received anti-BSA antibodies). One hour after the administration of anti-MPO, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also injected intraperitoneally in some mice. Clinical manifestations (haematuria and leucocyturia) and pathological findings (necrotic crescentic glomerulonephritis) were more severe in mice receiving LPS, suggesting that LPS is an aggravating factor in anti-MPO vasculitis [2].",

The physiopathology of the complex relationship between infection and vasculitis is not understood completely, but new molecular tools should allow a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these pathologies and may offer a different therapeutic approach in the future.",
