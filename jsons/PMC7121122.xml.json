            "text": "The simplest notation of a tRNA is tRNAAA, where AA is a specific amino acid. For example, tRNAGly refers to all tRNAs that can be charged with amino acid glycine (Gly). A slightly more complicated notation is tRNAAA/AC, where AC refers to tRNA anticodon. For example, tRNAGly/GCC refers specifically to tRNAGly with a GCC anticodon. The general notation of a tRNA is AA2-tRNAAA1/AC, where AA1 is the amino acid the tRNA is supposed to carry, AA2 is the amino acid that is actually carried by the tRNA, and AC is the anticodon. In most cases, AA1 and AA2 are the same. However, there are two cases where AA1 and AA2 can be different. The first is modification of AA2 by a biochemist. The second occurs naturally in a number of species across all three domains of life (Sheppard et al. 2008; Yuan et al. 2008), where Gln-tRNAGln, Asn-tRNAAsn, Cys-tRNACys, and Sec-tRNASec are formed indirectly by two steps. Take Gln-tRNAGln and Asn-tRNAAsn, for example. Glu is first misacylated to tRNAGln, and Asp to tRNAAsn, to form Glu-tRNAGln and Asp-tRNAAsn, respectively. The resulting misacylated tRNAs are then converted to Gln-tRNAGln and Asn-tRNAAsn by a group of tRNA-dependent modifying enzyme.",

            "text": "Isoacceptor tRNA is a somewhat confusing term as it may carry two slightly different meanings. It could refer to a single tRNA decoding different synonymous codons, e.g., tRNAGly/GCC decoding GGC and GGU codons. Alternatively, it could refer to a set of different tRNAs that carry the same amino acid but decode different synonymous codons. For example, tRNAGly/GCC, tRNAGly/CCC, and tRNAGly/UCC are isoacceptor tRNA s. They all carry amino acid Gly but with different anticodons decoding different synonymous Gly codons. Different isoacceptor tRNAs could decode the same codon. For example, tRNAGly/CCC decodes GGG, but tRNAGly/UCC decodes both GGA and GGG, so GGG is decoded by both tRNAGly/CCC and tRNAGly/UCC. Thus, isoacceptor tRNA refers to (1) one tRNA decoding different synonymous codons or (2) a set of tRNAs that carry the same amino acid but decode different sets of synonymous codons. The intersection of different sets of synonymous codons may not be empty. For example, the set of codons decoded by tRNAGly/CCC is {GGG}, and the set of codons decoded by tRNAGly/UCC is {GGA, GGG}. The intersection of the two sets is {GGG}.",

If codon XYZ encoding amino acid AA1 can be misread by tRNA carrying amino acid AA2 (AA1 \u2260 AA2), then that tRNA is a near-cognate tRNA for codon XYZ. The second definition is based on nucleotide similarity among codons. A codon XYZ has nine XYZ-like codons which differ from XYZ by a single nucleotide. Some of these XYZ-like codons are synonymous to XYZ and some not. The set of tRNAs that can decode any of those nonsynonymous XYZ-like codons are near-cognate tRNAs for codon XYZ because they can \u201cpotentially\u201d misread codon XYZ.

The only problem is how to treat reassignment between a sense codon and a stop. Such a change probably should occur less frequently than reassignments involving two sense codons. All pairwise comparisons among the 24 rows (24 genetic codes) generate 609 reassignments involving 2 sense codons and 445 reassignments between a sense codon and a stop codon. However, during the long evolutionary time, the more frequent reassignments will erase each other and the frequencies of their occurrences will be underestimated. So the actual difference between the two numbers must be much greater. If we count each reassignment between a sense codon and a stop codon as equivalent to four reassignments between two sense codons, we obtain a distance-based tree in Fig. 9.1. The topology remains the same if we treat each reassignment between a sense codon and a stop codon as equivalent to two, three, or five reassignments involving two sense codons.",

For such highly expressed proteins, it is very important for their coding genes to have efficient coding strategy to maximize the rate of translation.

There are 11 tRNAArg/UCU genes in the yeast genome that form perfect Watson-Crick base pair with AGA but only one tRNAArg/CCU with AGG. So we expect yeast genes, especially highly expressed ones, to use AGA and avoid AGG, which is true (Table 9.4). The same applies to all other synonymous codon families or subfamilies, except for the Cys codon family. Why the rarely used Cys codon family should be exceptional remains unknown. It is possible that Cys codon UGC may happen to be followed by a GNN codon, leading to methylation of C at the third codon position which then changes to T via spontaneous deamination. Whether the yeast genome has cytosine methylation remains controversial, with both evidence for (Tang et al. 2012) and against (Capuano et al. 2014) the existence of methylation in . However, there is significant CpG deficiency and TpG and CpA surplus in genome, which is consistent with CpG-specific DNA methylation.",

Nucleotide substitutions are synonymous at some first codon positions but nonsynonymous at all second codon position.

            "text": "However, the pattern in Fig. 9.3, while consistent with the mutation hypothesis, has resulted in two misconceptions. First, the pattern shown by the third codon position is often interpreted to reflect mutation bias. This interpretation is incorrect because the third codon position is subject to selection by differential availability of tRNA species (Carullo and Xia 2008; Xia 1998a, 2005, 2008; Xia et al. 2007). We may contrast a GC-rich Streptomyces coelicolor and a GC-poor Mycoplasma capricolum as an illustrative example. M. capricolum has no tRNA with a C or G at the wobble site for fourfold codon families (Ala, Gly, Pro, Thr, and Val), i.e., the translation machinery would be inefficient in translating C-ending or G-ending codons. This implies selection in favor of A-ending or U-ending codons and will consequently reduce GC% at the third codon position. This most likely has contributed to the low GC% at the third codon position in M. capricolum. In contrast, most of the tRNA genes translating the five fourfold codon families in the GC-rich S. coelicolor have G or C at the wobble site, and should favor the use of C-ending or G-ending codons. This most likely has contributed to the high GC% at the third codon position in S. coelicolor. In these two cases, mutation bias and tRNA-mediated selection are in the same direction to drive up or down GC% at the third codon position. The same pattern is observed for twofold codon families. The most conspicuous one is the Gln codon family (CAA and CAG). There is only one tRNAGln gene in M. capricolum with a UUG anticodon favoring the CAA codon. In contrast, there are two tRNAGln in S. coelicolor, both with a CUG anticodon favoring the CAG codon. Thus, the high slope for the third codon position in Fig. 9.3 is at least partially attributable to the tRNA-mediated selection. Relative contribution of mutation and tRNA-mediated selection to codon usage has been evaluated in several recent studies (Carullo and Xia 2008; Xia 2005, 2008; Xia et al. 2007).",

This hypothesis does not deny the existence of codon adaptation, but it asserts that codon-anticodon adaptation and increased elongation efficiency are not related to protein production. Instead, the benefit of codon adaptation and increased elongation efficiency is to increase ribosomal availability for global translation.

It explains why tRNAIle/IAU, where I in IAU is inosine derived from A, is able to translate all three Ile codons (AUC, AUU, and, albeit inefficiently, AUA), why a tRNA with a GI can translate Y-ending codons (where Y stands for C or U), and why a tRNA with a UI can translate R-ending codons (where R stands for A or G).

As an example of parsimonious tRNA usage, the Y-ending codons, be they in twofold or fourfold codon families, are decoded by tRNAs with either a II or a GI, but never both. This rule is obeyed in all three kingdoms of life. Almost all fourfold codon families in Mycoplasma pulmonis (including the Ser UCN codon family and Leu CUN codon family) are decoded by a single tRNA species with a UI, except for the Thr ACN and Arg CGN codon families which are each decoded by two tRNA species, one with a UI and other with a GI. The most dramatic simplification of tRNome is observed in vertebrate mitochondria, e.g., vertebrate mitochondrial genomes which contain only 22 tRNA genes, with each tRNA species decoding a codon family. Instead of separate initiation tRNAiMet/CAU and elongation tRNAeMet/CAU present in all nuclear genomes, a single tRNAMet/CAU, with a modified CI, decodes both the initiation AUG codon and internal Met AUR codons. Each Y-ending codon family is decoded by a single tRNA species with a wobble GI and each R-ending codon family by a single tRNA with a wobble UI which is modified to prevent its pairing with U or C.

            "text": "Wobble pairing is not without cost as it often reduces translation efficiency and accuracy and is generally avoided (Xia 2008). For example, an II/A3 pair is bulky because it involves two purines (Fig. 9.4) in contrast to other base pairs which typically involve a large purine and a small pyrimidine. For this reason, Ile is rarely coded by AUA except for certain viruses with a strong A-biased mutation (van Weringh et al. 2011). Among a set of highly expressed genes in the yeast ( ), AUA is not used at all (Table 9.5). Similarly, a tRNA with a UI can translate A-ending codons better than G-ending codons (Grosjean et al. 2010; Xia 2008). Most of the yeast tRNAArg have a UI, and only one AGG codon is found in contrast to 314 AGA codons in highly expressed yeast genes (Table 9.4). Yeast genomic data also suggest that a tRNA with a GI can translate C-ending codons better than U-ending codons. For example, the yeast tRNAAsn genes translating the Asn AAY codon family all have a GI. Among 219 Asn codons in highly expressed yeast genes, only 11 are AAU codons, suggesting strong selection against AAU codons in favor of AAC codons (Table 9.4). Note that the yeast genome is strongly AT-biased. If there is no selection against AAU codons, we would expect more AAU codons than AAC codons, which is contrary to the observed frequencies. However, the selection against GI/U3 pair is in general much weaker than that against UI/G3 pair. In fungal mitochondrial genomes, there is no avoidance of GI/U3 pair in favor of GI/C3 pair, although UI/G3 pair is strongly avoided in favor of UI/A3 pair (Xia 2008). The weak, or lack of, selection against GI/U3 can explain several puzzling counterexamples against the codon-anticodon adaptation theory (Bulmer 1991; Ikemura 1981b; Xia 1998a) which states that the most frequently used codon in each synonymous codon family should form Watson-Crick base paring with the anticodon of the most abundant tRNA species to reduce translation error and increase translation efficiency. For example, Cys codons (UGY) are translated by tRNACys/GCA in both cytoplasm and mitochondria in the yeast, yet most Cys codons have U3. If there is little selection against GI/U3 pair (i.e., GI/U3 pair is as efficient and accurate as GI/C3 pair), then the frequencies of UGC and UGU will be mostly determined by AT-bias. Because the yeast nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are both AT-rich, we have more UGU codons than UGC codons, in spite of GI in tRNACys. The weak selection against GI/U3 but strong selection against UI/G3 also explains why Y-ending codons are typically translated by a tRNA with a GI, whereas R-ending codons are typically translated by two different tRNAs, one with a UI and the other with a CI (Xia 2008).",

Chemical modification of UI to restrict its pair versatility to R3 in twofold R-ending codon family is universal in all three kingdoms of life and in organelles (Grosjean et al. 2010; Lim 1994). On the other hand, the tRNAMet/CAU in vertebrate mitochondria need to read both the initiation AUG codon and the internal AUG and AUA codons, and its CI is modified to f5CI to increase its wobble versatility so as to form a f5CI/A3 pairing between the anticodon and the AUA codon. Nucleotide modification in tRNA has been extensively reviewed (Grosjean et al. 2010) and chemically detailed in MODOMICS (Czerwoniec et al. 2009).",

A tRNA species with a wobble UI is almost always present among tRNA species decoding fourfold codon families and twofold R-ending codon families, with most exceptions observed in the Arg CGN codon family. In the mitochondrial genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans (metazoan), Marchantia polymorpha (plant), Pichia canadensis (fungus), and (fungus), there is no tRNAArg/UCG, and Arg CGN codon family is decoded by tRNAArg/ACG (Xia 2005). The lack of tRNAArg/UCG in the mitochondrial genome of these diverse taxa suggests that the lack is an ancestral state and that the presence of tRNAArg/UCG in vertebrate mitochondria is a derived state.

Thus, the anticodon UCG would wobble-pair with stop codon UGA through a wobble GIII/U1 pair and should therefore be strongly selected against (Carullo and Xia 2008). This explains not only the absence of tRNAArg/UCG in diverse evolutionary lineages but in particular why tRNAArg/UCG is absent in most eubacterial species and ancestral mitochondrial lineages where UGA is used as a stop codon and why it is present in derived mitochondrial lineages such as vertebrate mitochondrial genomes where UGA is no longer used as a stop codon.",

For example, another dsDNA phage, enterobacteria phage WV8, carries 20 tRNA genes on its genome. In such cases, the phage genes would adapt to the modified tRNA pool which may be different from the tRNA pool where E. coli mRNAs are translated normally (i.e., without phage infection). Partly for this reason, the correlation in RSCU between enterobacteria phage WV8 and its E. coli host is much weaker than that shown in Fig. 9.5 (Chithambaram et al. 2014a). Phage TLS (Fig. 9.5) happens to have a genome that does not encode any tRNA genes of its own. So it depends entirely on the host tRNA pool to decode the codons of its genes.",

            "text": "Second, codon usage adaptation takes time. If a phage having adapted to one host has switched to a new host, and if the original host and the new host differ in their tRNA pools, then the phage codon usage will be more similar to that of the original host than the new host. This may be applicable to phage PRD1 which belongs to the peculiar Tectiviridae family with members parasitizing both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Phage PRD1 is the only species in the family known to parasitize gram-negative bacteria, with other members of the family, i.e., phages PR3, PR4, PR5, L17, and PR772, parasitizing gram-positive bacteria (Bamford et al. 1995; Grahn et al. 2006). It is reasonably safe to assume that the phage PRD1 lineage has switched host from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, there is only one amino acid difference in the coat protein between phages PRDl and PR4 (Bamford et al. 1995). This suggests that PRD1 is phylogenetically close to its relative parasitizing gram-positive, i.e., the host-switching may have occurred quite recently. In fact, codon usage in phage PRD1 is more similar to that in gram-positive bacteria than in gram-negative bacteria (Chithambaram et al. 2014b). Among 87 bacterial genomes covering major groups of bacterial species, the host species with codon usage most similar to that of phage PRD1 are strains in the gram-positive Geobacillus (NC_014206, NC _012793, NC_014650, NC_014915, NC_013411).",

The lysogenic phase effectively hides protein-coding genes of the phage from tRNA-mediated selection, and the phage codon usage will be at the mercy of mutation bias in the host genome. In contrast, virulent phages have their codon usage under tRNA-mediated selection every time they enter the host cell. For this reason, one would expect better codon usage adaptation in virulent phages than in temperate phages, which is true (Prabhakaran et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Fifth, mass translation of phage mRNA often occurs in the late infection phase when the host cellular environment has already been dramatically altered, presumably with a quite different tRNA pool in the late phase from that in the early phase. In vaccinia virus, the degradation of host mRNA appears nearly complete 6 h after the viral infection as no host poly(A) mRNA is detectable at/after this time (Katsafanas and Moss 2007). Shutdown or drastic alteration of host protein and RNA expression implies that many tRNA species are no longer sequestered for host translation, which would dramatically alter availability of different tRNA species. Many other viruses, including hepatitis C (Chan and Egan 2009), SARS (Minakshi et al. 2009), Japanese encephalitis virus (Su et al. 2002), and coxsackie B2 virus (Zhang et al. 2010), can induce stress responses such as the UPR (unfolded protein response) in late phase. URP often results in the shutdown of transcription of ribosomal RNAs as well as repression of translation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-2\u03b1 (DuRose et al. 2009). All these suggest that the tRNA pool in the late phase differs from that in the normal cell. If codon usage of phage genes adapts to the altered tRNA pool in the late phase, whereas that of host genes adapts to the tRNA pool and normal cells, then we should not expect the parasite and the host share high similarity in codon usage. Interestingly, HIV-1 early genes have RSCU positively correlated with RSCU of human genes, but HIV-1 late genes have RSCU values negatively correlated with RSCU of human genes (van Weringh et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Sixth, if mutation bias is in different direction from tRNA-mediated selection, e.g., if tRNA-mediated selection favors Y-ending codons whereas mutation bias favors R-ending codons (where Y and R stand for pyrimidine and purine, respectively), then strong mutation bias will disrupt selection. This may well be the case for the poor codon adaptation in HIV-1. According to a recent compilation of tRNAs in human genome (Chan and Lowe 2009), the AUC codon can be translated by 17 tRNAIle species (14 tRNAIle/IAU and 3 tRNAIle/GAU) and AUU can be translated by 14 tRNAIle/IAU species, whereas AUA can be translated by only 5 tRNAIle/UAU species. In agreement with the tRNA-mediated selection, human genes code Ile mostly by AUC and least by AUA. In contrast, HIV-1 genes code Ile mostly by AUA and least by AUC (Haas et al. 1996; Nakamura et al. 2000). The poor codon adaptation of HIV-1 (Fig. 9.6a) reduces the translation efficiency of HIV-1 genes. Modifying HIV-1 codon usage according to host codon usage has been shown to increase the production of viral proteins (Haas et al. 1996; Ngumbela et al. 2008). The high frequency of maladaptive AUA codons in HIV-1 genes is due to high A-biased mutation at the third codon position of HIV-1 genes (Jenkins and Holmes 2003). The A-bias is mediated by the error-prone reverse transcriptase (Martinez et al. 1994; Vartanian et al. 2002) and the human APOBEC3 protein (Yu et al. 2004). The frequency of A can reach up to 40% in some HIV-1 genomes (Vartanian et al. 2002), resulting in a preponderance of A-ending codons which are typically rarely used in the human HEGs (Kypr and Mrazek 1987; Sharp 1986).",

One viral species that may shed light on this prediction is HTLV-1 which infects the same type of host cell as HIV-1. Both HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are retroviruses with RNA genomes, but HTLV-1 is exceptional in that it does not have a strong A-biased mutation (Van Dooren et al. 2004; van Hemert and Berkhout 1995). HTLV-1 relies for the most part on the host polymerase to replicate through clonal expansion of infected cells rather than undergoing iterative replication cycles like HIV-1 (Strebel 2005). The substitution rate of HTLV-1 is consequently lower, about 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al. 2004; Van Dooren et al. 2004), whereas that of HIV-1 is around 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al. 2004). Thus, although HTLV-1 infects the same cells as HIV-1, i.e., human CD4+ T cells (Rimsky et al. 1988), and both viruses are therefore subject to the same selective pressures on codon usage by the host tRNA pool, mutations are less likely to disrupt codon-anticodon adaptation in HTLV-1 than in HIV-1 as they occur at a lower rate in the former. The positive correlation in RSCU between HTLV-1 and highly expressed human genes (Fig. 9.6b) is highly significant (Pearson r = 0.4982, p < 0.0001, Spearman r = 0.4688, p = 0.0002).",

What originally prompted them to formulate this hypothesis is the observation that CAI for HIV-1 early genes are significantly greater than CAI for HIV-1 late genes when highly expressed human genes are used as reference genes. These late genes encode mass-translated HIV-1 structural proteins and are typically expected to have higher CAI than the relatively lowly expressed early genes.

What matters in translation elongation is not the abundance of transcribed tRNAs but the availability of charged tRNAs. It is tedious to determine the level of charged tRNAs, and researchers typically would use transcriptionally determined tRNAs or even the number of tRNA genes in the genome as a proxy of charged tRNAs. Unfortunately, the abundance of tRNAs often do not reflect the abundance of charged tRNA (Elf et al. 2003).",

For example, a wobble cmo5U in the anticodon of tRNAPro, tRNAAla, and tRNAVal can read all four synonymous codons in the respective codon family, but the same cmo5U in tRNAThr cannot read C-ending codons (Nasvall et al. 2007). For this reason, the optimal codon usage is likely better approximated by the codon usage of HEGs than what we can infer based on codon-anticodon pairing. Consistent with this proposition, CAI , which is based on the codon usage of HEGs (HEGs), performs better in predicting protein production or abundance than other indices based on tRNAs (Coghlan and Wolfe 2000; Comeron and Aguade 1998; Duret and Mouchiroud 1999).",

Other than those previously outlined (Xia 2007c), it often leads to wrong interpretation of tRNA-mediated selection. I illustrate this problem here with the Ala codon subfamily GCR (where R stands for either A or G). The frequencies of GCA and GCG in HEGs, as compiled and distributed with EMBOSS (Rice et al. 2000), are 1973 and 2654, respectively, which may lead one to think that E. coli translation machinery prefers GCG over GCA. However, the codon frequencies of GCA and GCG for E. coli non-HEGs are 25,511 and 43,261, respectively. Thus, GCA is relatively more frequent in E. coli HEGs than in E. coli non-HEGs. This suggests that mutation bias favors GCG, but tRNA-mediated selection favors GCA. The battle between the mutation bias and tRNA-mediated selection leads to increased usage of GCA in E. coli HEGs relative to LEGs , although GCA is still not as frequent as GCG in HEGs. This interpretation is corroborated by the E. coli genome encoding three tRNAArg genes for GCR codons, all with a UGC anticodon forming perfect Watson-Crick base pair with codon GCA.",

The main reason is that, for genes encoded by the nuclear genome, the R-ending codons are typically decoded by two types of tRNA species (one with a wobble C and the other with a wobble U), whereas the Y-ending codons are decoded typically by a single type of tRNA species with either a wobble G or a wobble A modified to inosine, but never by both (Grosjean et al. 2007; Marck and Grosjean 2002). For this reason, the R-ending and Y-ending codons, even within a single fourfold codon family, are subject to different tRNA-mediated selection and therefore should be treated separately. Such implementation is also relevant for certain experimental settings that induce mutation almost exclusively in NNY codons, which is the case in Kudla et al. (2009). However, for comparative purposes, I have included two alternative ITE implementations in DAMBE (Xia 2013, 2017d): (1) with compound sixfold and eightfold codon families broken into twofold and fourfold codon families and (2) lumping all synonymous codons into one codon family.

When such codons are replaced by rarely used codons, protein production is reduced (Robinson et al. 1984; Sorensen et al. 1989). Similarly, when codon usage is optimized, protein production is increased (Haas et al. 1996; Kaishima et al. 2016; Ngumbela et al. 2008). However, to what degree is translation elongation rate-limiting has been controversial. Early theoretical considerations (Andersson and Kurland 1983; Bulmer 1990, 1991; Liljenstrom and von Heijne 1987) tend to favor the argument that translation elongation is not rate-limiting in protein production, but translation initiation is. This hypothesis states that codon-anticodon adaptation and increased elongation efficiency are not related to protein production. Instead, the benefit of codon adaptation and increased elongation efficiency is to increase ribosomal availability for global translation and timely response to environmental perturbations.",

The rationale for using MFE as a measure of translation initiation is that an initiation codon would be inaccessible if it is embedded in a strong secondary structure and that accessibility of the initiation codon is a key determinant of translation initiation efficiency (Nakamoto 2006). Stable secondary structure in sequences positioned at or before the start codon has been experimentally shown to inhibit translation initiation (Osterman et al. 2013), presumably because it embeds SD and start codon in a structural stem and consequently hiding the SD and start codon signals from ribosomes. The previous chapter on translation initiation has already highlighted the point that mRNAs in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes tend to have much weaker secondary structure near the start codon than elsewhere, especially those from highly expressed.",

Second, when ITE is small (e.g., ITE < 0), protein abundance is generally low, suggesting that translation elongation is limiting.

Second, for correlational studies, nature generally does not generate bacterial genes with high translation initiation efficiency but poor codon adaptation or low translation initiation with high codon adaptation. However, the experiment by Kudla et al. (2009) generated both of these unnatural associations, leading to a lack of positive association between protein production and codon adaptation.

            "text": "One key deficiency in Eq. (9.10) is that it does not distinguish between selection due to translation efficiency or that due to translation accuracy (Akashi 1994). Take Asn codons AAC and AAU in E. coli, for example. AAC is a major codon (heavily used by highly expressed genes and decoded by the most abundant isoacceptor tRNA ), whereas AAU is a rarely used minor codon. A major codon is typically translated faster than a minor codon, and highly expressed E. coli genes use AAC almost exclusively to code for Asn, so one could argue that the overuse of AAC is driven by SE. However, AAC and AAU also differ in misreading rate, in particular by tRNALys which ideally should decode only AAA and AAG codons but does misread AAC and AAU, leading to Asn replaced by Lys. This misreading error rate is six times greater for AAU than for AAC, with the error ratio maintained in both Asn-starved and Asn-non-starved conditions (Johnston et al. 1984) or with streptomycin used to inhibit translation (Johnston and Parker 1985). Thus, the overuse of AAC could be driven either by selection for increased translation efficiency or increased translation accuracy or both. Designating SA as selection for translation accuracy, we have three alternative hypotheses expressed, in the simplest form, as9.11\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{CA}=\\alpha +{\\beta}_1{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{E}} $$\\end{document}CA=\u03b1+\u03b21SE9.12\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{CA}=\\alpha +{\\beta}_1{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\\end{document}CA=\u03b1+\u03b21SA9.13\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{CA}=\\alpha +{\\beta}_1{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{E}}+{\\beta}_2{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{A}}+{\\beta}_3{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{E}}{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\\end{document}CA=\u03b1+\u03b21SE+\u03b22SA+\u03b23SESA",

He reasoned that, if codon adaptation is due to selection for translation efficiency, then all codons in the gene should be subject to similar selection regardless of whether the codon is in a functionally important or unimportant site. In contrast, if codon adaptation is driven by selection for translation accuracy, then the selection is stronger in functionally important sites than in functionally unimportant sites. So we should observe greater codon usage bias in functionally important codon sites than functionally unimportant codon sites. He found greater codon adaptation in conserved amino acid sites than in variable amino acid sites and concluded that this difference between the conserved and variable sites to have resulted from selection for accuracy.",

However, such a hypothesis, without considering other factors, often does not produce easily testable predictions. For example, we expect highly expressed proteins to maximize the use of energetically cheap amino acids and avoid the use of the expensive ones. However, many ribosome proteins are highly expressed, yet the need for many of them to bind to the negatively charged mRNA demands the usage of positively charged amino acids such as Lys and Arg that are typically energetically expensive to make in the cell. This would lead to an association between high expression and energetically expensive amino acid, thus confounding the prediction that highly expressed genes should maximize the use of cheap amino acids. Furthermore, amino acid availability changes with environment, and the same amino acid may be manufactured differently with different energy consumption in different organisms. So it is not easy to measure energetic cost of amino acids in different organisms. One could, however, turn the question around and ask how one can characterize energetic costs of amino acids by bioinformatic means. For example, in the ideal situation when all other factors affecting amino acid usage have been controlled for, we may infer that the avoided amino acid is perhaps rare or energenetically expensive to make. This type of inference is of course not very satisfactory and is often derogatively termed the backdoor smuggling approach because one does not present direct evidence for energetic cost.",
