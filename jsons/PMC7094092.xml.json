            "text": "Reported first in the Guangdon province of China, in late 2002, as an atypical pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is of concern, since it subsequently rapidly spread to over 25 countries and displayed an estimated mortality rate of 3\u20136% in infected humans, leading to more than 700 human deaths (Donnelly et al., 2003). In March 2003, four months after the first case was reported, the causative agent of SARS was identified as a new coronavirus (CoV) (Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003). The complete genomic sequence (29,751 nucleotides) of the +ssRNA virus was reported a month later (Marra et al., 2003), providing the opportunity for more in-depth studies and the identification of potential targets for drug and vaccine development. The genome of SARS-CoV contains 11\u201314 major annotated open reading frames including those predicted to encode for known viral proteins, including the replicase polyproteins, S (spike protein), polymerase, M (membrane protein), N (nucleocapsid protein) and E (small envelope protein). The viral proteinase and replicase are the preferred targets for searching and designing of antiviral compounds. Indeed, the SARS-CoV main proteinase, 3CLpro (also called Mpro), exhibits a key role in proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins and, as an essential protein for viral replication and function, is viewed as a key target.",

            "text": "Whilst phylogenetic analysis of the SARS genome reveals little resemblance to any of the three known groups of cornoaviruses, several of the specific viral genes, including the main protease gene (SARS-CoV 3CLpro), do show significant homology. Thus, sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with orthologues from other coronaviruses indicated that the enzyme is highly conserved, with 40% and 44% sequence identity, respectively, to human CoV (HCoV) 229E proteinase and procine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) proteinase (Anand et al., 2003). The crystal structure of the 3CLpro protein has been determined (Yang et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2005), revealing that it is similar to those of other CoV proteinases. SARS-CoV 3CLpro forms a homodimer, comprised of three domains. Domains I (residues 8\u2013101) and II (residues 102\u2013184) are \u03b2-barrels and together resemble the structure of chymotrypsin, respectively, whereas domain III (residues 201\u2013306) consists mainly of \u03b1-helices. Domains II and III are connected by a long loop (residues 185\u2013200). The active site of the Mpro is comprised of a catalytic dyad that consists of the conserved residues H41 and C145, which are located at the cleft between domains I and II (Huang et al., 2004). The availability of protein structures and the known biological characteristics of 3CLpro both encourage and help facilitate it to be a key target for searching for drugs directed against SARS.",

In particular, the proteinase inhibitor Kaletra, which is a mixture of the proteinase inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir (Fig. 1\n), exhibits encouraging signs of being partially effective against the SARS virus (Vastag, 2003). Therefore, a deeper understanding of known proteinase inhibitors as anti-SARS drugs can be used as a starting point to design and discover better or more specific inhibitors for the treatment of SARS, as well as any mutations by predicting resistance mechanisms and/or new drugs for such mechanisms in advance.",

Energy minimization and MD simulations were achieved using the SANDER module of AMBER 7 with the Cornell force field (Cornell et al., 1995). The parm99 force field, which describes the structure and conformation of each compound, was applied. All MD runs reported here were achieved under an isobaric\u2013isothermal ensemble (NPT) using a constant pressure of 1 atm and a constant temperature of 298 K. The SHAKE algorithm (Ryckaert et al., 1977) was used to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Energy minimizations were carried out to relax the system prior to MD runs. To incorporate the solvent and counter ions into the models, each system was neutralized with the counter ions (Na+) and solvated with the TIP3P water model (Jorgensen et al., 1983). The total number of atoms for the three simulated systems, free SARS, SARS\u2013LPV and SARS\u2013RTV, were 77,866, 77,966 and 86,788, respectively. The crystallographic waters were also kept in the simulation box. The simulation time step was set at 2 femtosecond (fs). The simulation steps consist of thermalization, equilibration, and production phases. Initially, the temperature of the system was gradually raised to 298 K for the first 60 picosecond (ps) and then kept constant according to the Berendsen algorithm with a coupling time of 0.2 ps. The systems were maintained at 298 K, until 600 ps. Finally, the production phase started from 600 ps to 2 ns. The 1400 ps trajectories of the production phase were used to calculate the average structure. All MD simulations were carried out for 2 ns. The quality of the geometry and the stereochemistry of the protein structures were validated using PROCHECK. MD trajectories were evaluated in terms of the root-mean-square displacement (RMSD), changes of the distances, torsion angles, H\u2013bond and binding free energies using the CARNAL, Ptraj and MM-PBSA modules of the AMBER7 simulation package.",

The RMSDs of the overall structure and two inhibitors with respect to the initial configuration were analyzed and plotted (Fig. 3\n). The overall RMSDs for the three systems appeared to have reached equilibrium after 600 ps. Whilst no significant difference was found for the overall (black) and for the back bone (dark grey) RMSDs of all plots, that of the RTV in the SARS\u2013RTV complex (light grey) was found to change substantially. This is due to the rotation of the RTV in the SARS-CoV 3CLpro pocket, i.e., initial (docking) conformation of the RTV is totally different from that after equilibration.",

Conformational changes of the catalytic binding domain play a critical role in ligand binding. Here, the ligand-binding site of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro was evaluated focusing on the amino acid sequence around the active sites (H41 and C145, see Fig. 2) of the CoV proteinase (Anand et al., 2002, Anand et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003). The binding of the inhibitor is likely to affect the relative motion between the apex of the loop with respect to the D48 and Q189 loops upon the insertion of inhibitor. The probability distributions of the associated interatomic distances from the center of mass of the following residues for the three systems, d1:H41-C145 and d2:D48-Q189, were evaluated and plotted (Fig. 4\n). Clearly, SARS-CoV 3CLpro shows different dynamic flexibilities in the binding region when the SARS-selective inhibitors are bound to their active sites. In the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme, the most probable d1 distance between H41 and C145 takes place at about 10.0 \u00c5, but this is contracted to \u223c7.1\u20137.3 \u00c5 in the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complexes. For the distance between D48 and Q189, d2, in the loop region, no significant differences were observed between free enzyme and two enzyme\u2013inhibitor complexes. Rather the optimal distances, represented by the maximum of the plots, for both SARS-CoV 3CLpro and its two inhibitor complexes are between 8.64 and 10.02 \u00c5 (Fig. 4b).",

Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a, Hornak et al., 2006b). In addition, the SARS\u2013RTV distribution plots are narrower and higher than those of the SARS\u2013LPV, indicating a lower flexibility of the catalytic pocket and the flap loop of the SARS\u2013RTV complex compared to that of the SARS\u2013LPV complex. This fact relates directly to the greater flexibility of the longer side chain of the RTV than that of the LPV.",

In contrast, C145 and D48 residues generate two peaks (Tor2 and Tor3), representing two preferential conformations. Changes of their conformations due to complex formations were clearly observed for all four residues. For H41, C145 and Q189, where their orientations were represented by Tor1, Tor2 and Tor4, respectively, their side chains were rotated via complex formations, to the same direction for both inhibitors. This is in contrast to D48, where its side chain was induced by RTV and LPV to turn to the opposite side. Tor3 increases for the RTV complex (dotted line in Fig. 5b), whilst only the first peak of \u221257\u00b0 decreases to \u2212147\u00b0 for the LPV complex (dashed line in Fig. 5b).",

The analysis of the energetic binding affinity between the HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors has been extensively performed based on free energy calculations. We have found that the interaction of LPV and RTV does not show a significant difference for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme.",
