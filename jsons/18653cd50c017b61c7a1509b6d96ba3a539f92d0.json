            "text": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH ) is a disease of pulmonary vascular resistance increase caused by a variety of factors, ultimately leading to right ventricular failure. 1 Animal experiments demonstrated that chronic cigarette exposure may cause lung parenchyma and airway inflammation, and induce the reconstruction of small pulmonary vessels and small airway, resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension. 2, 3 Previous studies have reported that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system was involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH. 4, 5 The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increased in the pulmonary arterial of patients with PAH. 5 RAAS system activation and increased AngII levels were observed in PAH rats induced by hypoxia and monocrotaline, 6 and the expressions of AngII and AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) were also increased in vivo. 7 In addition, treatment with ACEI or AT1R inhibitors can relieve the pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH, and improve endothelial function in hypoxia-monocrotaline-treated rats. 8 In the RAAS system, the key role of ACE is to promote Ang I to generate AngII. ACE2 is a regulating member of RAAS system discovered in recent years, with a key role in the pathway of AngII-Ang generation (1-7). 9 ACE and ACE2 may have opposite physiological effects; ACE2 is the specific negative regulatory mechanism after RAAS system activation. 9-11 ACE2 has been suggested to be associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus infection, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and PAH induced by monocrotaline. A recent study showed that the antihypertensive effect of AT1R was partly due to the increased metabolic AngII by ACE2. 8 Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether ACE2 and ACE have effects on the PAH induced by chronic cigarette exposure, further exploring the exact mechanism of chronic cigarette smoking-induced PAH.",

            "text": "Smoke-mediated oxidative stress response can stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and induce inflammatory response. 12 Selman et al. 13 reported that smoking may act directly on the vascular system, affecting the release of vascular regulation factor, thus regulating vascular contraction and relaxation and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle. Eventually, it leads to increased vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure which is caused by the remodeling of pulmonary arterioles, arteries and micro arteries. [6] [7] [8] This study confirmed that chronic cigarette-smoke exposure significantly increased RVSP in rats, which was significantly reduced by losartan. Mean pulmonary arterial hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular muscle degrees were also observed in rats exposed to cigarette smoke for 16 weeks. 14 Our findings were consistent with the above study; cigarette exposure for six months can significantly increase RVSP in rats. In summary, chronic cigarette smoke may directly lead to the pulmonary artery remodeling and PAH. In recent years, it has been found that exposure to nicotine (the main component of cigarette smoke) can increase both the expression and activity of ACE in human endothelial cells. 15 ACE plays a key role in the RAAS system, which can convert Ang I to AngII; cigarette smoke exposure can activate the RAAS system to increase AngII levels. The major physiological and pharmacological effects of AngII are mediated by AT1R, 16 and it has been confirmed that AngII plays an important role in PAH by binding to AT1R. 16 This study suggested that the pathogenesis of cigarette-induced PAH also involves the activation of the RAAS system. We found that compared with the control group, PAH rats exposed to cigarette smoke for six months had a reduction in ACE2 expression and an increased expression of ACE and AngII (almost double). In the RAAS system, ACE decomposes Ang I to generate potent vasoconstrictor and ACE2 hydrolyzes Ang I to generate a negative regulatory protein Ang (1-7). 9 In previous study, Karram et al. 17 found that losartan therapy affected plasma ACE protein expression in normotensive rats. Some experiments have confirmed that losartan can effectively increase ACE2 activity and its protein expression in rat myocardium or human kidney. Increased ACE2 can accelerate the conversion of AngII to Ang (1-7) to reduce the concentration of AngII. [18] [19] This study found that after six months of exposure to cigarette, ACE2 protein expression was significantly reduced and pulmonary artery pressure was increased significantly in rat lungs.",

Losartan treatment can effectively reduce the degree of PAH and reverse the increased AngII and ACE expression, indicating that losartan can not only inhibit the effect of AngII in the lung tissue of cigarette smoke-induced PAH rats, but can also reduce the levels of AngII. ACE and ACE2 play roles in chronic cigarette smoke-induced PAH by regulating AngII expression.",
