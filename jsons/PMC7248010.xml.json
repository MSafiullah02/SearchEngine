            "text": "Eliminating insects inhabiting chicken houses is still an unresolved problem in the poultry industry worldwide. A common insect in poultry farms is the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus Panzer. This insect, because of its tropical origin, has fully adapted to conditions prevailing in poultry houses. It appears in large numbers in poultry litter and manure, especially under feeders and drinking troughs. This pest feeds primarily on spilled poultry feed or cracked eggs but eats sick and weakened or dead chickens as well (Axtell and Arends, 1990; Salin et al., 2000). It is well known that this pest is a source and vector of several pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and platyhelminthes parasites that cause serious poultry and human diseases (Watson et al., 2000; Hazeleger et al., 2008; Roche et al., 2009). In addition, A. diaperinus destroys thermal insulation systems in poultry houses when mature larvae emigrate to search for isolated pupation sites (Vaughan et al., 1984). Such a damage causes temperature drop inside buildings. Thus, its presence in poultry houses creates serious sanitary and economic problems for poultry farmers. The basic method for controlling the pest is by applying chemical insecticides such as pyrethroids, organophosphorus compounds, macrocyclic lactones, and benzylurea compounds, at the end of the poultry cycle. However, these methods are ineffective and do not provide long-term protection against the pest. Continuous usage of these insecticides results in the selection of resistant pest population and increased levels of the chemicals used in the environment. An increasing number of publications have described the resistance of pest to these compounds in several countries (Tomberlin et al., 2008; Chernaki-Leffer et al., 2011; Hickmann et al., 2018). Thus, owing to environmental pollution caused by the excessive use and misuse of agrochemicals and the requirements of health food from consumers, alternative methods must be sought. This problem may solved by introducing proecological factors into chicken houses to ensure long-term protection against the pest as well as guaranteeing poultry safety. This can be achieved by using essential oils or their main components, especially terpenes. The toxic and behavioral effects of these natural products on the lesser mealworm has been well documented in literature (Szczepanik and Szumny, 2011; Prado et al., 2013; Szo\u0142yga et al., 2014; Testa et al., 2018). The results of these studies show that essential oils or their components obtained from various plant species can be used to control A. diaperinus. The methods of their application in poultry houses can differ; they can be used as a feed additive in poultry nutrition, dietary antibiotic replacer, botanical insecticide, or additive to broiler litter material (Hippenstiel et al., 2011). An appropriate polymer carrier containing components of essential oils can be easily mixed in a suitable proportion with the litter and remain in the broiler house throughout the entire poultry cycle. The role of such a carrier may be fulfilled using starch.",

            "text": "Starch consists of two fractions: amylose {(C6H10O5)n where n=5000} and amylopectin {(C6H10O5)n, where n=50 000}, in 20\u201325% and 75\u201380%, respectively (Raquez et al., 2008). Pure starch is a white, semi-crystalline substance free of smell and taste (Kapu\u015bniak et al., 2011; Bajer et al., 2012). Its melting point range is 220\u2013240\u00b0C and its glass transition temperature is 230\u00b0C, higher than its decomposition point at 220\u00b0C. Therefore, processing starch in its pure form is difficult; starch must be subjected to plastification to lower its glass transition point, thus breaking the hydrogen bonds and partly decomposing the starch (Poutanen and Forssel, 1996). Using an increased amount of plasticizer softens all types of starch and lowers the glass transition point (Yu et al., 1998; Mo\u015bcicki et al., 2009; Bajer et al., 2011). Starch of 10% humidity and glycerol content 20-35% shows a glass transition point (Tg) of up to 83\u201371\u00b0C (Yu et al., 1998). Van Soest and Knooren (1997) stated that starch of 11% humidity and glycerol content 26% shows Tg=40\u00b0C. The glass transition point of starch materials of considerable humidity and glycerol content is lower than 20\u00b0C (Mitrus, 2009).",

Water as a starch modifier limits the upper processing temperature by extruction blowing molding because of water vapor emission leading to porosity of the material (Thunwall et al., 2008). Plasticizer causes an interaction between starch macromolecules that increases the elongation at break as well as impact strength, thus lowering the tensile strength (Rychter et al., 2016).",

The litter containing granules with the lowest carvacrol content, 3%, had a limited effect. This environment was toxic only for the larvae, especially for younger ones; they died within six days. By contrast, the survival rate of the adults was high; during one week, only 20% of the insects died (Table 2). Poultry litter mixed with granules containing 5% carvacrol was toxic only to larvae, especially in equal proportions; therefore, those granules were not highly effective. The total mortality of adults in both variants was at a similarly low level. This creates the risk of a relatively rapid restoration of the pest population. The introduction of a smaller amount (30%) of granules to the litter, but with a higher content of carvacrol (10%) was effective only against younger larvae. After three days, only 20% of these larvae remained alive and during one week, all larvae died. However, this variant was not effective against older larvae and adults. The mortality of older larvae after one week was only above 50%; for adults, it was approximately 20% (Table 2). Increasing the amount of these granules in the litter to 40% resulted in a significant increase in toxicity of the substrate for all tested developmental stages of the pest. Three days after treatment, all younger larvae and adults died; mortality among the older larvae was 57.5%. After the next day, mortality among the older larvae increased to 100%. A comparison of the results shows that adding 40 and 50% of the granules into the litter, i.e., an addition exceeding 10%, does not increase the mortality among insects significantly. From a practical and economic perspective, poultry litter with the addition of starch granules with 10% carvacrol in ratio 40:60% (granules:pellets) appears to be the optimal medium applicable to broiler houses for A. diaperinus control.",

Similarly, 5% Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil used with pine shavings reduced infestation by Alphitobius diaperinus in poultry litter (Testa et al., 2018). However, after applying a 5% dose, a second application of the oil was required in the middle of the chicken rearing cycle. It can be assumed that the use of granules containing 5% carvacrol in two applications can be equally effective. Meanwhile, a higher dose of carvacrol accelerates mortality at all life stages of the pest and prevents re-infestation.",

The growth, health, and survival recorded during the rearing of the broiler chickens depended primarily on the quality of the inserted hatchlings. The starting average body weight of the hatchlings was similar to the value of the indicator (42 g) contained in the \u201cROSS 308 Broiler Performance Objectives\u201d (2014) (www.aviagen.com) and ranged from 42.9 g in the control to 42.7 g in the treatment group. During the first 3 weeks of chicken life, a high rate of body weight gain in both groups was observed (Table 3). The average body weight of these broilers was even higher than the standard of 959 g. In this period, only one broiler chicken from the control group died. From the third to the fifth week, the body weight of broiler chickens exposed to treated litter was higher compared to that of the control, but without significant statistical differences (Table 3). The high body weight gain of all chickens recorded between day 21 and 42 of rearing increased the density of chickens in the experimental boxes from 33 to 40 kg/m2. This could be a reason contributing to the increase in broiler chicken mortality. During this period, six broiler chickens in the carvacrol group died, while only three died in the control group (Table 3). Carcasses of the dead birds were assessed by veterinary examination. Based on anatomopathological changes observed through bacteriological and parasitological tests of the intestinal mucosa, it was found that the cause of broiler chicken death was advanced colibacillosis, with symptoms of inflammation in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Colibacillosis can be caused by poor environmental conditions (highly dusty chicken house, presence of ammonia in the environment, and overcrowding). However, considering the intense odor of carvacrol with a strong irritating effect emitted from litter, lack of dust, imperceptible odor of ammonia in the experimental room, and exceedance in bird body weight, determining the direct cause of colibacillosis of the respiratory tract of the chickens is difficult. However, it appears that the strong smell of carvacrol as the cause of broiler chicken death can be ruled out. In the first three weeks when the odor emission was the strongest, death was not observed among the carvacrol-treated birds. The observed increase in bird mortality in this period was likely the result of the onset of sudden cardiac death among experimental chickens that had an intense initial rate of weight gain and subsequently achieved a large, final body weight.",

Additionally, it is necessary to evaluate the amount of carvacrol in the tissues of birds, especially in the muscle tissue and the liver. However, based on other studies, it can be assumed that these granules can be used successfully without the risk of accumulation in tissues. Bioactive terpenes are quickly absorbed after oral, pulmonary, or dermal administration, and most are metabolized and either eliminated by the kidneys in the form of glucuronides or exhaled as CO2. Hence, their accumulation in the body is unlikely owing to the rapid clearance and short half-lives (Brenes and Roura, 2010). Essential oils or individual terpenes are widely recommended as a feed additive in poultry nutrition. Birds supplemented with the plant extracts showed higher body weight gain and increased feed consumption when compared with the other groups (Krishan and Narang, 2014). Carvacrol contained in the granules, through antibacterial and antiviral activities, will enhance the sanitary conditions of the chicken house. The application of starch granules enriched with carvacrol in broiler house would reduce the use of chemical insecticides and enable the production of healthy food.",
