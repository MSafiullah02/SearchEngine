Many of these EIDs, particularly respiratory viruses, have been found to be zoonotic in their origin (Morens, Folkers, & Fauci, 2004) and are often only identified in humans after a spillover from the animal reservoir has occurred. Such examples include avian influenza viruses, swine influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Ebola virus (Wang & Crameri, 2014) . Given that zoonotic viruses have repeatedly caused serious disease outbreaks throughout the world, they are considered to be the most likely aetiological agents for the next pandemic (Morse et al., 2012) . Hence, understanding the epidemiology of viral zoonotic diseases, especially in environments where humans and animals have close contact, is important for prevention efforts.",

More recently, there has been an outbreak of swine influenza variant (H3N2v) virus transmitted from pigs to humans at agricultural fairs in the Midwest, resulting in a total of 376 human cases as of 2 August 2017 (Centres for Disease, 2017). There has also been evidence to suggest an earlier peak in influenza virus transmission among populations residing in geographical areas with a higher density of swine farms (Lantos, Hoffman, Hohle, Anderson, & Gray, 2016) . However, even with this knowledge of potential viral exchange, the human-livestock interface is seldom studied, and often only when an outbreak has already occurred. One barrier to implementing routine surveillance at the human-livestock interface is the concern that identifying a novel agent might have a negative economic impact on production.",

The filter cassettes were placed in the same location in each room, approximately 1.5 m above the ground, between where the medical provider and patient would sit. The sampling pumps were calibrated to a flow rate of 5 L/min and allowed to run for approximately 120-180 min. At the end of the sampling period, study personnel recorded the room number, minutes of sampled air, date, time and sampler number. Cassettes were then placed on wet ice and immediately transported back to the Duke One Health Research",
