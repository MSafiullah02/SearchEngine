By the date of Mar 5th 2020, a total of 49,797 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 had been reported, and 2328 people had died of such infection in Wuhan.1 COVID-19 has spread around world rapidly, with the number of reported confirmed cases reaching a total of 14,053,2 imposing a threat to the global public health. Based on the understanding of the pathogen, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, the National Health Committee decided to include COVID-19 pneumonia as category B infectious diseases according to in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and to control it by taking prevention and control measures of Category A infectious diseases.3 People know little about COVID-19 although a series of related studies have been reported. Moreover, there were fewer reports on COVID-19pregnant women and their outcomes. The pathophysiological changes of SARS and MERS during pregnancy are more likely to lead to severe adverse pregnancy outcomes.4\n,\n5 Currently, there are insufficient data to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their outcomes.6\n,\n7 During the outbreak period, prevention and control of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and new- babies are becoming more important, especially when they undergo delivery during hospitalization. In order to control COVID-19 infection, the isolation suites in our hospital were set up, including outpatient suite, operation room, labor and delivery room, maternal suite, new-baby suite and suite for treating suspected pregnant patients. In order to address the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19, we retrospectively reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings and chest CT scan results of 55 suspected pregnant patients who were admitted to Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 20th to Marth 23th, 2020.",

If the confirmed cases and suspected cases were in labor, they could deliver their babies in isolation suites. During hospitalization, if the suspected patients were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection via throat swab test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) by using of quantitative RT-PCR(qPT-PCR),9 they would be transferred to designated hospital for further treatment. If they were tested negative for more than twice, they could continue to stay in our isolation maternal suite, then go home for isolated observation for two weeks. Additionally, if the cases were not timely diagnosed for suspected COVID-19 on admission, they could be transferred to isolation suite anytime for observation based on symptoms such as fever and/or cough, chest CT scan, and laboratory finding.",

Hu Z et al. 13 found that from close contacts confirmed with COVID-19 in Nanjing, China, there were 24 cases of asymptomatic infection. At present, there are limited data on COVID-19 pregnant women. Chen H et al. 6 reported COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women who presented typical symptoms in a designated hospital of Wuhan, and found seven patients presented with fever and other symptoms including cough(in four), myalgia(in three), core throat(in two), and malaise(in two). In our study conducted in a non-designated hospital of Wuhan, 13 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 were all in mild or asymptomatic degree, including only 15.4%(2/13) prenatal fever and 61.6%(8/13) postpartum fever, and 15.4%(2/13) coughing cases, and no one had expectoration, myalgia or fatigue, hemoptysis, headache, heart palpitations, diarrhea or dyspnea. This is probably because our study was limited to a non-designated hospital of COVID-19 infection and we have paid more attention to distinguish the normal and suspected COVID-19 infection to prevent cross-contamination.",

None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. With the rapid development from focal unilateral ground-glass opacity to diffused bilateral ground-glass opacity, early diagnosis of COVID-19 may be facilitated based on clinical and laboratory findings.15 In our observation, among 13 cases of COVID-19 infection, there were 6/13 presenting ground-glass opocity, 5/13 patch-like shadows, 3/13 fiber shadow, 5/13 pleural effusion, 1/13 pleural thickening and 3/13 normal. Pulmonary CT image of those manifestations is not the specific clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with the common pneumonia in the control group, the imaging showed no difference.",
