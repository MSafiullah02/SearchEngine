RNA viruses infect nearly every type of living organism\u2014from archea to unicellular bacteria and fungi to multicellular plants and animals. Many RNA viruses asymptomatically replicate within their hosts, inducing no obvious disease. Others lead to severe morbidity and/or mortality and therefore have important medical, economic, and social impacts. Specifically, RNA viruses are known to cause devastating diseases in humans, including but not limited to: systemic rashes (measles virus and rubella virus), gastrointestinal diseases (Norwalk virus, rotavirus, and hepatitis A and E viruses), respiratory diseases (SARS\u2010coronavirus, paramyxovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza A virus), chronic hepatitis/liver cancer (hepatitis C virus), hemorrhagic diseases (dengue virus and ebolavirus) and neurological diseases (West Nile virus, poliovirus, bunyaviruses, and rabies virus). In fact, of the 51 distinct families of RNA viruses currently recognized by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, approximately 14 of them contain known or suspected human pathogens (http://ictvonline.org).",

            "text": "Investigation of human RNA viruses and laboratory model animal strains from various families has shed light on a fundamental aspect of their lifecycle\u2014how they synthesize new RNA molecules. During infection, an RNA virus must mediate at least two RNA synthetic processes: (1) transcription of message\u2010sense viral RNAs (i.e., mRNAs) that can serve as templates for protein synthesis and (2) replication of viral genomic RNAs for their ultimate encapsidation into nascent virion particles. Both transcription and genome replication are mediated by specialized, virally encoded enzymes called RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps).1 RdRps are quite conserved among RNA viral families, and they share distant structural and functional homology to cellular DNA and RNA polymerases. However, these viral enzymes have no counterpart in the host cell, making them ideal targets for antiviral drug development.2, 3 Although RdRps are the sole polypeptides that catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) in an RNA\u2010templated manner, these enzymes almost never function alone in the context of an infected cell. Instead, they are usually found along with other viral and/or cellular proteins in higher ordered, multisubunit polymerase complexes. Interactions between the RdRp and cofactor proteins in the polymerase complex allow RNA viruses to precisely regulate the type and timing of viral RNA synthesis during infection and coordinate it with other lifecycle events. In this review, we explore the formation and function of polymerase complexes from several diverse RNA viruses. Particular attention will be paid to summarizing the results of high\u2010resolution structural studies of RdRps and regulatory cofactor proteins from six different RNA viral families (Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, Picornaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Reoviridae) (Table 1). This review is meant to serve as a general introduction into the complex world of RNA virus transcription and genome replication. Where appropriate, detailed review articles are referenced to provide readers enhanced insight into specific RNA synthetic mechanisms.",

A shared feature of (+)RNA viruses is that their genomes are inherently message\u2010sense. In fact, the genomes of these viruses often contain 5\u2032 7\u2010methylguanosine (m7G) caps and/or 3\u2032 poly\u2010A tails much like those of cellular mRNAs, allowing them to be efficiently recognized by the host protein synthesis machinery. Members of the Picornaviridae family, such as poliovirus, rhinovirus, hepatitis A virus, and foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus, do not have 5\u2032 capped (+)RNA genomes, but instead they employ RNA stem\u2010loop elements as an internal ribosomal entry sites.4 Moreover, translation of the Caliciviridae genome is dependent on the presence of a small, virally encoded protein (VPg), which is attached to the 5\u2032 end of the incoming (+)RNA and interacts with components of the host protein synthesis machinery.5, 6 As described below, VPg also serves an important role in initiation of RNA synthesis for Caliciviridae.",

Instead, these viruses utilize host ribosomes to make their RdRps and polymerase complex cofactors once inside the cell (Figure 1(a)). A characteristic trait of (+)RNA viruses is the manner in which their polymerase complexes are formed early in infection. Following entry of a (+)RNA virus into the host cell, the genome is translated into at least one large polyprotein, which is cotranslationally and posttranslationally cleaved by viral proteases into smaller, mature, nonstructural protein products (Figure 1(a)). One of these products is the actual RdRp polypeptide, whereas the other products (and oftentimes precursors) represent regulatory cofactors that play numerous roles during viral RNA synthesis. Most often, the RdRp\u2010containing polyprotein of (+)RNA viruses is intimately associated with membranes of intracellular organelles (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, endosomes, and lysosomes).7 In fact, (+)RNA viruses are known to hijack and rearrange cellular membranes in order to fashion scaffolds on which (or within which) the RdRp mediates transcription and genome replication.",

Unlike the genomes of (+)RNA viruses, those of (\u2212)RNA viruses cannot be directly translated into protein. Instead, the genomic (\u2212)RNA must first be copied into mRNA prior to being used as templates by host ribosomes (Figure 1(b)). Thus, all known (\u2212)RNA viruses will package their polymerase complex, including their RdRp polypeptide, inside of the virion particle. Viruses in the Rhabdoviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families are the most well studied in terms of RNA synthetic strategies. These viruses have single\u2010stranded, (\u2212)RNA genomes that are directly bound by a viral polymerase complex.

The mRNAs generated via this process are not encased by nucleocapsid protein, and they usually contain a 5\u2032 m7G cap structures and 3\u2032 poly\u2010A tails. As such, the viral mRNAs are translated very efficiently by host ribosomes, generating virion structural proteins and new polymerase complex components. For the Rhabdoviridae member, vesicular stomatitis virus, transcription occurs via a start\u2010and\u2010stop mechanism, whereby the RdRp pauses at regulatory signals in the RNA and then reinitiates at the next gene start.19 Termination of the RdRp at intergenic regions also includes a slippage on a poly\u2010U tract to generate the poly\u2010A tails of the mRNAs.19 Genome replication for vesicular stomatitis virus then occurs when the polymerase complex creates a full\u2010length, antigenome (+)RNA by ignoring the transcriptional signals (Figure 1(b)). This antigenome is organized as an RNP, allowing it to be effectively copied into a (\u2212)RNA genome molecule (Figure 1(b)). While influenza A virus and other members of Orthomyxoviridae exhibit a similar RNP\u2010dependent transcription and replication strategy, they do not employ a start\u2010and\u2010stop mechanism. Instead, the influenza A virus polymerase complex creates nearly full\u2010length mRNA copies of each of the eight (\u2212)RNA genome segments.20, 21 Replication of the viral genome is templated by full\u2010length antigenome (+)RNA intermediates, which are copied into (\u2212)RNA strands and encapsidated into RNPs.18 Unlike (+)RNA viruses, which perform transcription and genome replication in intimate association with cellular membranes, RNA synthesis for (\u2212)RNA viruses occurs either in cytosolic inclusions (e.g., Rhabdoviridae) or in the host nucleus (e.g., Orthomyxoviridae).",

Rotaviruses contain 11 dsRNA genome segments and virion\u2010associated polymerase complexes. A unique characteristic of rotaviruses and other Reoviridae members is that they perform all stages of RNA synthesis within a subviral particle.23 More specifically, upon entry of the dsRNA virus into the host cell cytoplasm, the genome is maintained inside an icosahedral capsid; it is not released into the cytosol like those of (+)RNA and (\u2212)RNA viruses (Figure 1(c)). The RdRps within the capsid transcribe mRNAs using the (\u2212)RNA strands of the dsRNA as templates. A single RdRp is thought to be dedicated to each of the dsRNAs, and it is tethered to the inner surface of the capsid, near the icosahedral vertices.24 New (+)RNAs acquire a 5\u2032 m7G cap via viral enzymes as they exit the capsid through aqueous channels. Viral (+)RNAs lack poly\u2010A tails, but nonetheless serve as mRNAs to direct efficient protein synthesis. Two of the rotavirus\u2010encoded proteins induce the formation of inclusions in the host cell cytosol where early particle assembly and genome replication occur.25 These inclusions are not necessarily membrane\u2010associated, but have been shown to contain markers of autophagosomes and lipid droplets.26, 27\n",

Although RdRps from different RNA viral families can vary tremendously in their amino acid sequences, they are strikingly similar in their three\u2010dimensional organization. For example, the RdRps of poliovirus, Norwalk virus, hepatitis C virus, and rotavirus (residues 333\u2013778) all exhibit a central cupped, right\u2010handed architecture with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains31, 32, 33, 34, 35 (Figure 2). This general design is also shared with the distantly related DNA\u2010dependent DNA polymerases, DNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases, and reverse transcriptases.1 Unlike these other polymerases, however, which open and close upon templates, RdRps adopt closed structures mainly because of intramolecular interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains. For (+)RNA viruses in the Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Picornaviridae families, the closed conformation of their RdRps creates three distinct tunnels from the surface of the molecules into the catalytic centers, allowing for (1) the entry of the RNA template, (2) the entry of NTPs and exit of pyrophosphates, and (3) the exit of a transient dsRNA duplex.36 Indeed, RdRps of (+)RNA viruses have been extensively studied structurally and functionally, followed closely by those of dsRNA viruses. RdRp polypeptides of (\u2212)RNA viruses, such as those in the Rhabdoviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families, have been difficult to express and purify.17 As such, little high\u2010resolution structural information exists for the RdRps of (\u2212)RNA viruses (see also below).18, 37\n",

Several of these motifs (A\u2013D) are also seen in cellular polymerases and reverse transcriptases, suggesting that they are critical for the nucleotidyltransferase reaction. Motifs A and C are the most well characterized for RdRps, as they contain the aspartic acid residues that coordinate the two metal ions required for phosphodiester bond formation.39 Specifically, the carboxylate groups of these amino acids anchor a pair of divalent metal ions (usually Mg2+), which play the major role in catalysis. One metal ion promotes the deprotonation of the 3\u2032\u2010OH of the nascent primer, whereas the other ion facilitates the formation of the pentacovalent transition state at the \u03b1\u2010phosphate of the NTP and the exit of the inorganic pyrophosphate group.40 For the poliovirus RdRp, other motifs are known to be involved in nucleotide recognition and binding (A and B), enzyme fidelity (A and D), and initiation of RNA synthesis (E and F)38, 40, 41 (Figure 3). While only some of these motifs have been experimentally confirmed for other RdRps, such as those in rotavirus, they are expected to play analogous roles35, 42 (Figure 3).

The RdRps of Reoviridae members, rotavirus and reovirus, are prime examples because they contain a central right\u2010handed polymerase domain as well as two additional domains comprised of the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini35, 44 (Figure 4). The globular N\u2010terminal domain of the rotavirus RdRp helps anchor the continuous surface of the fingers and thumb subdomains, effectively closing the enzyme. For the rotavirus RdRp, several residues of the N\u2010terminal domain are involved in RNA template interactions.35, 45 The C\u2010terminal domain resembles the sliding clamps of cellular RNA polymerases, which encircle DNA templates and aid in processivity.46 While the precise functions of these additional domains are not understood, they are known to be critical for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In fact, their presence creates a caged enzyme with a central hollow active site. The C\u2010terminal bracelet helps create a fourth tunnel (along with the fingers and palm subdomains) in the Reoviridae RdRps. Unlike other known RdRps, which only contain template entry, NTP entry/pyrophosphate exit, and dsRNA exit tunnels, those of Reoviridae have a fourth tunnel that likely serves as an exit site for (+)RNA transcripts.35\n",

            "text": "RNA synthesis by viral RdRps always occurs in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, and it can be separated into two distinct steps: initiation and elongation. The primer requirement for the initiation step of RNA synthesis varies among the different viral RdRps. Some viral RdRps can initiate de novo (in the absence of primer), whereas others require the presence of a protein or RNA oligonucleotide. During de novo initiation, the first phosphodiester bond is formed between the 3\u2032\u2010OH of the initiating NTP and the 5\u2032 triphosphate of the second NTP. In most cases, initiation takes place at the exact terminus of the template RNA, and as such, the initiating nucleotide is dictated by the template. However, for Flaviviridae members, hepatitis C virus and bovine viral diarrheal virus, initiation of RNA synthesis requires a high concentration of GTP, irrespective of the RNA template.47, 48 Thus, GTP does not serve as the initiating NTP, but instead plays a key structural role supporting the initiating NTP.49, 50 The GTP\u2010binding site that provides a de novo initiation platform is best described for the bovine viral diarrheal virus RdRp.51 The GTP is bound inside the template entry tunnel, 6 \u00c5 from the catalytic site, and makes contacts with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains (Figure 5(a)). While there is currently no high\u2010resolution structure of a Flaviviridae RdRp in the midst of initiation (i.e., with divalent ions, GTP, RNA template, and an initiating NTP), it is suggested that the special GTP may position the 3\u2032\u2010OH of the first NTP for nucleophilic attack.51 The stabilizing GTP is not incorporated into the nascent RNA strand, but rather is thought to be released from the active site during RNA elongation. In addition to this special GTP, a C\u2010terminal loop element is implicated in de novo initiation for Flaviviridae RdRps52 (Figure 5(a)). This loop likely supports the special GTP, but it must move out of the way during elongation so as not to obstruct the egress of the nascent dsRNA.",

However, rather than utilizing a GTP molecule and C\u2010terminal loop to support the initiating NTP, these RdRps employ an internal loop, which is located in between the fingers and palm subdomains35, 44 (Figure 5(b)). In fact, both the first and the second NTPs are stacked together by the priming loop from the bottom and by residues of motif F from the top.35, 44 For the reovirus RdRp, the first two NTPs are further supported by base\u2010pair interactions with the RNA template. Following phosphodiester bond formation between these NTPs, a stable dinucleotide is formed, and the RdRp transitions to elongation mode.44 Interestingly, in the rotavirus RdRp apoenzyme structure, this loop is in a retracted state, incapable of NTP binding.35 It is hypothesized that engagement of the rotavirus RdRp by its cofactor protein induces a structural change in the position of the priming loop, thereby allowing for NTP binding and, thus, the initiation of RNA synthesis (see also below).35\n",

Members of the Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae families, such as Norwalk virus, poliovirus, rhinovirus, hepatitis A virus, and foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus, employ VPg, a small (\u223c20\u2013100 amino acids in length), virally encoded protein, to prime RNA synthesis.53, 54, 55 VPg is covalently bound to the 5\u2032 end of the (+)RNA genome, but it must be modified by nucleotide addition and transferred to the 3\u2032 end of the template prior to its use as a primer. For Picornaviridae members, the VPg protein is uridylated (i.e., several UMP molecules are attached). This uridylation reaction is catalyzed de novo by the viral RdRp and is templated by an internal stem\u2010loop element in the genomic (+)RNA. Much of our understanding of VPg\u2010dependent initiation of RNA synthesis is based on structural studies of the Picornaviridae member foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus. In particular, the structures of the foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus RdRp (1) in complex with uridylated VPg and (2) in complex with a template\u2010primer duplex have provided remarkable insight into this initiation mechanism.56, 57, 58 Together, these structures reveal how VPg accesses the RdRp catalytic site from the front part of the molecule and how the first five nucleotides of the oligo (A) template traverse the template entry tunnel (Figure 5(c)). The final base of the RNA template points toward the catalytic site and is in a correct position to be paired with the UMP molecule that is covalently attached to VPg. Essentially, the 3\u2032\u2010OH of the UMP serves as a molecular mimic of a nucleic acid primer. Moreover, it is important to note that, for the foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus RdRp, high\u2010resolution structures of the enzyme in different states of RNA elongation also exist, providing exquisite insight into the molecular basis for the lack of RdRp fidelity.59\n",

High\u2010resolution X\u2010ray crystal structures of 3D versus 3CD have provided insight into proteolysis\u2010dependent activation of the RdRp.33, 74, 75 Initial X\u2010ray crystal structures of 3D contained packing artifacts, because of the inherent (albeit possibly biologically relevant) capacity of the polymerase to oligomerize.74, 75 These 3D\u20133D interactions obscured the location of the extreme N\u2010terminus of the protein.74 More accurate structures of 3D were generated using a mutant protein that cannot form oligomers.76 In that later structure, the N\u2010terminus of 3D is buried in a pocket at the base of the fingers subdomain, where it helps position the catalytic\u2010site aspartate residues to select the incoming 3\u2032\u2010OH group of NTPs. In the structure of the RdRp\u2010inactive 3CD precursor, the 3C and 3D domains do not make any direct contacts with each other and are connected by a seven\u2010residue polypeptide linker76 (Figure 6(b)). The N\u2010terminal residues of the 3D domain that comprises the linker are relocated in the context of 3CD, thereby preventing catalysis (Figure 6(b)). Thus, the lack of polymerase activity in 3CD is thought to be associated with the preclusion of the N\u2010terminus from the 3D domain. Moreover, in the 3CD structure, the 3D domain makes extensive contacts with the 3C and 3D domains of neighboring molecules.76 The 3C N\u2010terminus is proximal to the VPg\u2010binding site in 3CD, an arrangement that is consistent with a possible role for these contacts in forming and regulating the poliovirus VPg uridylation complex. Essentially, polyprotein processing allows poliovirus to tightly regulate the stoichiometry of 3CD and 3D in the polymerase complex, and therefore to maximize the functions of these proteins during VPg uridylation, initiation, and elongation.",

The location of RNA synthesis for this virus makes sense in light of its mechanism of transcriptional initiation using 5\u2032 m7G\u2010capped oligonucleotides stolen from cellular pre\u2010mRNAs. The PB2 subunit is responsible for binding to the 5\u2032 m7G cap of a cellular pre\u2010mRNA molecule, while the PA subunit will cleave the structure. Then, PB1 will utilize the stolen capped oligonucleotide as a primer for viral RNA synthesis (see also above).",

Portions of the VP2 N\u2010terminal domain are also detected near VP1, perhaps forming tethers that support the polymerase. Thus, in the context of a static structure, both the N\u2010terminal domain and the apical subdomains of the VP2 core shell directly bind VP1. These same regions have been shown to be involved in VP1 enzymatic activation in vitro, suggesting that they may trigger the capacity of the enzyme to mediate RNA synthesis.103 It is hypothesized that engagement by VP2 causes structural rearrangements in VP1 that may include lifting the priming loop to allow for NTP binding. The VP2\u2010dependent mechanism of RNA synthesis for rotavirus ensures that dsRNA genome is only made within a particle that is the morphogenic precursor to a mature virion. Interestingly, the RdRps of several Caliciviridae members, Norwalk virus and murine norovirus, also show enhanced enzymatic activity in the presence of their cognate capsid proteins.104 This observation suggests that coordination of RNA synthesis with virion assembly via polymerase regulation may occur for other families of RNA viruses in addition to Reoviridae.",

It is clear from these examples that RNA viruses have evolved distinctive strategies to control the activity of their RdRps and to orchestrate the kinetics of their lifecycle. Indeed, RNA viral RdRps are almost always found along with other viral (and oftentimes cellular) proteins in higher ordered, multisubunit polymerase complexes.
