In our data, G1a, G1b, G2a and G2b accounted for 1.9% (24 strains We also made a more detailed classification for G2 group, in which G2a was divided into two subgroups, and G2b was separated into four subgroups (Figure 4 ).

Through comparing S1 sequences of all strains with CV777, we found PEDV showed a significant decrease in nucleotide identity with CV777 with time, which meant more diversity generated due to a high mutation rate of coronavirus. To some extent, this also indicated a change in prevalence of PEDV. And further phylogenetic analysis confirmed our assumption. Using the typical classification method (Lee, 2015) , we divided all strains into four groups, in which G2a and G2b are the two most prevalent in China. Traditionally, there was more than one group of strains prevalent in one region, which made PEDV prevention more difficult and complicated. For example, all four groups of PEDV strains existed in Guangdong, Jiangsu and Jiangxi.",

In the detailed classification of G2 group, strains of clades 2, 5 and 6 were more widely distributed in China than those of clades 1, 3 and 4. In our samples, G1b and G2b were first detected at 2012 while G1a and G2a were first detected at 2014 and 2013, respectively(Table 1). In the detailed subgroups, clades 5 and 6 were first detected at 2012, which belonged to typical variant strains, and clades 1 and 3 were first detected at 2013, and clades 2 and 4 were first detected at 2014.Next, we tried to analyse the origin of clades 1, 2, 3 and 4 according to the collection time.

The 10 strains of clade 2 at 2014 were collected in Hubei (three strains), Anhui (four strains) and Jiangsu (two strains). The strains of clade 4 at 2014 were all detected in Guangdong. These results indicated that geographically Guangdong might be the origin of clades 1, 3 and 4, and Hubei, Anhui and Jiangsu might be the origins of clade 2. 3 | DISCUSSION PEDV S gene plays an important role in the molecular epidemiology and in the genetic variation of PEDV field strains. In order to control and prevent PEDV infection, it is necessary for us to further investigate the prevalence of PEDV and the molecular characteristics of the S genes of Chinese PEDV field strains during 2012-2017. In this study, the genetic epidemiology of 1,235 PEDV samples collected between 2012 and 2017 in China was investigated. These samples were collected from 400 farms in 15 provinces, which was one of the most widespread surveys of PEDV in China. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of a large scale of sequences of partial spike gene, several important findings involving the genetic evolution of PEDV in China were unveiled. We found that G2a and G2b are the two most prevalent in China, and they have evolved into six different subclades. And we got some clues of origins of subclades by analysing the time and region of collected PEDV samples in each subclade. Besides, we also got one S indel strain in Guangdong and two S indel strains in Anhui.",

In other word, clades 1, 2, 3 and 4 might contain new mutant strains in G2 group. We concluded that Guangdong might be the origin of clades 1, 3 and 4, and Hubei, Anhui and Jiangsu might be the origins of clade 2. Taken together, these results provided us a clear landscape of genetic epidemiology of PEDV circulating in China in 2012-2017 and would help in the areas of accurate PEDV prevention. 4 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 4.1 | Source of specimens and PEDV isolation Between January 2012 and April 2017, porcine faecal samples (n = 1542) were collected from pigs affected by PEDV from 400 farms in 15 provinces (Guangdong, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Liaoning, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Chongqing, Hebei and Shanxi).
