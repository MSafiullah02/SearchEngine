            "text": "The role of the immune system is to protect a body against bacterial, viral, or any foreign antigen invasions. In order to improve protection, vaccination is used to boost immunity against diseases caused by microorganisms. It typically contains a less virulent agent that triggers a reaction, thus, stimulating a body\u2019s immune system to recognize it as foreign. In the process, a body\u2019s defense mechanism learns to recognize and destroy a microorganism, its toxins or surface proteins [94] every time an invasion is identified. The use of vaccination is important because it promotes the stimulation of the body\u2019s defense mechanisms and the development of both individual and collective immunity. Vaccination can act on specific (adaptive) and nonspecific (innate) immune responses unlike immunostimulants which only act on innate response. In addition, it should be noted the role vaccines play in controlling diseases as preventative as well as non-therapeutic measures. Therefore, the body is able to produce antibodies that recognize, signal and neutralize pathogens or particular cellular responses which detect the specific antigens with high efficiency and affinity. As a result, vaccines protect the body against future infections [27] thus reducing the need for the use of antibiotics and other types of drugs.",

The study of the use of vaccines in fish is an area of fast-growing. As aquaculture expands and the need to control pathogens becomes more pressing, the commercial vaccination of different varieties of fish is already a reality in many countries. It aids in the prevention of diseases that could pose health risks to the shoal as well as in avoiding the economic losses due to mortality caused by infection. It reduces the contamination of water bodies by the excessive use of antibiotics, and the reduction of final fish product quality [5, 24, 42, 79, 100].",

In spite of rodents being the most widely used research model in the world, in recent decades the use of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model has exponentially increased among the scientific community. It follows the principle of 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) as required by a multiplicity of national and international regulatory bodies. Furthermore, the use of zebrafish model results in a reduction of time and use of resources when compared to those more established animals\u2019 models. It also provides a greater informational and predictive capacity when compared to in vitro results [53]. Thus, using the zebrafish model, it is possible to replace and reduce the use of mammals in research as well as mitigate problems related to the welfare of those animals. Furthermore, zebrafish is used as confirmatory models of the positive previously obtained results, thus, having the ability to refine the findings [2]. A review of the literature was carried out aiming at presenting the most recent information on vaccination of fish, which brings to light the advantages of this animal model in tests of efficacy and safety of both animal and human vaccines.",

These are normally assessed using animal models, mainly mammals, which are often imprecise in reflecting human diseases [93], not to mention time consuming, and require a large number of animals. Moreover, the mortality and clinical signs as well as laboratory tests are usually analyzed to evaluate the innate (non-specific) or adaptive (specific) immune system response. As in mammals, Zebrafish has a well-maintained adaptive immune system composed of T and B lymphocytes that develop from the thymus and kidneys respectively. However, in relation to the development of memory lymphocytes, fish seem to have memory cells of the type B and T [78]. Yet, there has not been enough data to confirm that in Zebrafish. Zebrafish also presents the enzyme system involved in the process of genetic rearrangement that originates the B (BCR) and T (TCR) lymphocyte receptors. As in humans, Zebrafish has recombination activator genes that control the rearrangement of gene segments V, D and J to produce the diversity of antibodies and lymphocyte receptors. In addition, the zebrafish\u2019s immune system has only approximately 300,000 antibody-producing B cells, making it three orders of magnitude smaller than mice and five orders simpler than humans [48].",

            "text": "The efficiency of the humoral response increases due to the increased affinity of the antibodies. Affinity maturation of antibody responses is less efficient in cold-blooded vertebrates compared to mammals. Despite this, in zebrafish, data revealed that specific nucleotides in regions of the BCR receptor were target of directed mutations. Therefore it was suggested that activation-induced deaminase and affinity maturation contributed to the diversification of antibodies also in fish [56]. Immunization of teleost fish with the TNP-KLH antigen (linked to trinitrophenyl to keyhole limpet hemocyanin), for example, induced the production of specific low affinity antibodies, which were replaced in 5 weeks by antibodies of intermediate affinity, and after 15 weeks, by antibodies with greater affinity for the antigen [28, 97].",

As for vaccination in humans, for example, about 0.4 to 1.9 people per million who had been vaccinated with BCG against tuberculosis may have developed the disease through vaccine contagion. For hepatitis B, 1 in 600,000 people vaccinated may have presented a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). In the case of vaccine against poliomyelitis, vaccine contagion happened to 1 in every 3.6 million vaccinated. Moreover, to combat yellow fever, the vaccine contagion and seizures happened to 1 in 22 million and internal hemorrhages happened to 1 in 450,000. Thence, the occurrence of side effects is very rare. Side effect reactions in humans may also be observed to be caused by other vaccines such as yellow fever, measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, diphtheria and tetanus. The most common symptoms are seizures, severe allergic reactions, meningitis, encephalitis [26]. Although these risks are irrelevant when compared to damages that could be caused by the non-use of a vaccine, the toxicology, the side effects and immunization at different concentrations ought to be adequately tested.",

In recent years, zebrafish models have been chosen as the preferred model in the production of fish vaccination experiments against several pathogens that cause losses in aquaculture around the world such as bacteriosis and viruses. One of the most important pathogen studies applied to fishing production is attributed to Guo et al. [35]. They analyzed the protective efficacy of four iron-related recombinant proteins and their single-walled carbon nanotube encapsulated counterparts against the Aeromonas hydrophila infection in zebrafish.

Immersion, or bath vaccination, is a common practice in aquaculture, because of it being convenient as mass vaccination giving sufficient protection. The fish is submerged in water with a sub lethal concentration of the bacteria for a specific time. Liu et al.

[101] studied Th17-like immune response in fish mucosal tissues after administration of live attenuated V. anguillarum via different vaccination routes. When compared to injection vaccination, immersion vaccination elicited intense Th17-like immune responses in the gut tissue of zebrafish.

[54] proposed that adult zebrafish could be used to study the immune response to Shigella, which is crucial to understanding the crosstalk between Shigella and T-lymphocytes [75] thus this being relevant in the development of vaccine strategies. Studies have also been conducted with Zebrafish model to promote a vaccine against Salmonella, which produces gastroenteritis that causes massive morbidity and mortality in adults and children in developing countries. Howlader et al. [39] proved that zebrafish was an excellent model for the study of vaccines using successive immersion triple vaccines with the single serotype Salmonella. Typhimurium and Salmonella entereditis induced protective efficacy against a high dose (108 CFU/ml) of infection by these pathogens.",

This model is an important tool for the development of new safe vaccines against diseases which do not yet have preventive treatment, or for which the existing vaccines are not so effective. Thus, previous screening tests with zebrafish have been proven to be effective in preliminary phases prior to testing with mammalians. Despite the evidence from the literature indicating that science in this field is in its infancy, when compared to other animal models used in research, teleost models have proved to be effective in the elucidation of the infection and immunological responses to the diverse animal and human pathogens. In addition, the reduced financial cost and time frame needed for testing are another attractive regarding the use of zebrafish. Thus, it is expected its use would expand in the coming years.",
