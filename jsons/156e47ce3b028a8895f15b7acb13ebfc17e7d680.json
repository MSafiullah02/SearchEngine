In this study, we have used the RNA-seq gene expression pattern in the COVID-19 affected lung biopsy cells and compared it with the effects observed in typical cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We performed functional overrepresentation analyses using these differentially expressed genes to signify the processes/pathways which could be deregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in the symptomatic impairments observed in COVID-19. Our results showed that the significantly altered processes include inflammatory responses, antiviral cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and interleukin signaling etc. along with downmodulated processes related to lung's functionality likeresponses to hypoxia, lung development, respiratory processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and surfactant metabolism. We also found that the viral protein interacting host's proteins involved in similar pathways like: respiratory failure, lung diseases, asthma, and hypoxia responses etc., suggesting viral proteins might be deregulating the processes related to acute lung injury/breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. Protein-protein interaction networks of these processes and map of gene expression of deregulated genes revealed that several viral proteins can directly or indirectly modulate the host genes/proteins of those lung related processes along with several host transcription factors and miRNAs. Surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, TTF1 etc. which maintains the stability of the pulmonary tissue are found to be downregulated through viral NSP5, NSP12 that could lead to deficient gaseous exchange by the surface films. Mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the aberration of NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 etc. by NSP12; abnormal thrombosis in lungs through atypical PLAT, EGR1 functions by viral ORF8, NSP12; dulled hypoxia responses due to unusual shift in HIF-1 downstream signaling might be the causative elements behind the acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients. Our study put forward a distinct mechanism of probable virus induced lung damage apart from cytokine storm and advocate the need of further research for alternate therapy in this direction.",

However the complex interplays between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are yet to be completely illustrated. Apart from the cytokine storm, other factors like-host innate immunity, autoimmunity against the pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells, host genetics and epigenetic factors also play important role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection [15, 16] .

How the deregulation in the lung's gene expression profiles is related to the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and overall pathophysiology of lung failure is not yet devised. Moreover, how the lung's functionality related pathways are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 is still elusive. As a result, designing of more targeted therapeutic approaches for the clinical management of the COVID-19 patients is still very complicated. In this regard, we have analyzed a publicly available transcriptome data from the lung biopsy of a COVID-19 patient and summarized which pathways are particularly modulated during the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how the virus is playing a role in the deregulation of the biological processes/pathways related to lungs' overall functionality and causing acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients.",

Sequence matched exactly more than one place with equally quality were discarded to avoid bias [29] . The reads that were not mapped to the genome were utilized to map against the transcriptome (junctions mapping). Ensembl gene model [30] (version 99, as extracted from UCSC) was used for this process. After mapping, we used SubRead package featureCount (v2.21) [31] to calculate absolute read abundance (read count, rc) for each transcript/gene associated to the Ensembl genes. For differential expression (DE) analysis we used DESeq2 (v1.26.0) with R (v3.6.2; 2019-07-05) [32] that uses a model based on the negative binomial distribution. To avoid false positive, we considered only those transcripts where at least 10 reads are annotated in at least one of the samples used in this study and also applied a minimum Log2 fold change of 0.5 for to be differentially apart from adjusted p-value cut-off of \u2264 0.05 by FDR. Raw read counts of this experiment is provided in supplementary file 2. To assess the fidelity of the RNA-seq data used in this study and normalization method applied here, we checked the normalized Log2 expression data quality using R/Bioconductor package \"arrayQualityMetrics (v3.44.0)\" [22] . From this analyses, in our data no outlier was detected by \"Distance between arrays\", \"Boxplots\", and \"MA plots\" methods and replicate samples are clustered together (Supplementary file 3).",

Our above analysis as indicated that surfactant metabolism could be a target of this virus, we sought to check the routes of deregulations of this pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and how they are affecting the downstream signaling processes to impede normal lung function through impaired surfactant metabolism. To achieve this goal, we have mapped the differentially expressed genes in this pathway using Reactome pathway browser [38] . We looked deeply into the mechanisms of this pathway to elucidate the probable alterations happening in COVID-19 affected lung.",

But in COVID-19 affected lung, TTF1 and SFTPC genes are found to be downregulated, whereas SFTPB is upregulated ( Figure 3 ). GATA6 transcription factor promotes the transcription of SFTPA gene [55] which is involved in immune and inflammatory responses along with lowering the surface tension in the alveoli [56] and both of them are found to be upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung while the GATA6 antagonist LMCD1 was downregulated ( Figure 3 ). While the complex of CSF2RA and CSF2RB can bind GM-CSF to induce activation of macrophages [57] and degradation of STFPs in the alveolar macrophages [58] . We found CFSF2RA downregulated and CSF2RB Numerous genes in the hypoxic responses and HIF-1 alpha signaling were found to be abruptly regulated in the SARS-CoV-2 infected lung (Supplementary Figure 5) . PLAT, a tissue plasminogen activator, have profound roles in maintaining the normal homeostasis of lung and its aberrant regulation can lead to many lung injuries [62] . In the response to hypoxia process, in PPI map of differentially expressed genes of combined GOBP module 'response to hypoxia' and SARS-CoV-2 target genes [33] , this PLAT protein was found to be directly targeted by viral protein ORF8 ( Figure 5) . Moreover, several indirect responses from the viral protein interactions were also revealed ( Figure 5 ). SARS-CoV-2 M protein can target STOM which interacts with SLC2A1. SLC2A1 can also be targeted by host miRNA miR-320a ( Figure 5 ). ORF8 which interacts with OS9 can modulate EGLN1 and EGLN2. Figure 6 ). NSP5 can modulate NOTCH1 through HDAC2 ( Figure   6 ). Moreover, host miRNAs like-miR630 can downregulate TGFBR2; while miR-206, miR320a and miR-375 are downregulated so that SOX9 and WYHAZ are overexpressing ( Figure 6 ). Virus could hamper several growth factor signaling which are crucial for various lung injury repair mechanisms [64, 65] .",

Though the host miRNAs cannot target the YWHAZ which is a prosurvival protein [93] and also can induce expression surfactant protein A2 [94] , it can be indirectly modulated through viral protein NSP7 ( Figure 6 ). Likewise, viral protein ORF8 can indirectly modulate CHI3L1 ( Figure 6 ) which can suppress lung epithelium injury [95] .

LTBP3 can promote lung alveolarization [98] but can be modulated by SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP12 ( Figure 6 ). Aberration in NOTCH signaling contributes significantly in various lung diseases [99] , and in SARS-CoV-2 infection NOTCH1, HES1 is found to be downregulated ( Figure 6 ). CD55, a member of the complement system which plays crucial role in host defense in airway epithelium [100] , can be modulated by viral protein NSP12 (Figure 7 ).

Several mitochondrial genes like-NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 are found downregulated in COVID-19 affected lung ( Figure 7) ; as mitochondria plays important role in cellular respiration and lung diseases [102] , aberration of these might also lead to lung related complicacies.

Several lung diseases like-asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COPD etc. are reported to be associated with aberration in the functionalities of surfactant proteins [70, 106] . In SARS-CoV-2 affected lung, production of the surfactant proteins are found to be deregulated ( Figure 8 ) patient's lung cells ( Figure 1E ) which could lead to low accumulation of phospholipids in lungs. As phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) are the principal phospholipids of surfactant proteins [107] , impeded production of lipids will make surfactant proteins non-functional.",

            "text": "interactions lead to the disease complexity from a viral infection, causing several critical pathophysiological conditions in host respiratory system[51]. To explore which particular biological processes/pathways are deregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection we first identified the deregulated genes in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections and performed functional enrichment analyses and then did comparative analyses[36].We found 3031 (2408 upregulated and 623 downregulated), 142 (91 upregulated and 51 downregulated) and 6714 (2476 upregulated and 4238 downregulated) genes from SARS-CoV infected 2B4 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells and lung biopsy of COVID-19 patient, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). We discovered a wide array of genes to be differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung whose expression profiles were observed to be different in SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHBE cells and SARS-CoV infection (Supplementary Figure 1). As expected, from the enrichment analyses of GOBP, we have observed that biological processes related to antiviral inflammatory responses, viral processes etc. overrepresented in both types of SARS-CoV-2 infections (cell line and primary lung biopsy cells) and SARS-CoV infection (Figure 1A). While several biological processes like-negative regulation of viral replication, immune system process, response to hypoxia, heart development etc. were only enriched for both SARS-CoV-2 infections (Figure 1A), few pivotal processes namelyviral transcription, adaptive immune response, brain development, lung development, respiratory gaseous exchange by respiratory system were uniquely observed for the deregulated genes from COVID-19 affected lung (Figure 1A).Similarly, from 'Bioplanet' module, host antiviral immune responses like-various inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways, apoptosis, interferon-I signaling etc. were activated for all of these infections (Figure 1B, 1C). While, HIF-1 signaling, heart development, asthma, type-II interferon signaling etc. pathways were found in both SARS-CoV-2 infections (Figure 1B, Supplementary figure 2), curiously, some pathways likedisease associated with surfactant metabolism, ROS/RNS production, fatty acyl-CoA biosynthesis, ER-phagosome pathway, inflammasomes etc. were only found in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung biopsy (Figure 1C, Supplementary figure 2). To further understand, we used the module 'DisGeNet' for enrichment analysis which revealed that the deregulated genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections are also involved in different diseases like-virus diseases, lung diseases, asthma, pneumonitis, hypoxia etc (Figure 1D, Supplementary figure 2). Interestingly, several cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were found to be deregulated only in the lung biopsy sample of COVID-19 patient (Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure 2). As cholesterol in lung plays important roles in maintaining normal lung physiology and protection against many diseases [52], downregulation of these indicates possible association with lung-related comorbidities of COVID-19 patients. From these enrichment analyses, it is clearly understood that several pathways related to lung's overall functionality are being deregulated by the infecting SARS-CoV-2 virus. While hunting for more definitive clues on which particular processes are being regulated during this infection, we again performed another round of enrichment analysis with our in house combined module (Supplementary file 4) which gather related modules with few genes to a parent term/process which otherwise left out from analysis due to statistical stringency cutoff (module with 10 genes are selectedly) during enrichment analysis. Surprisingly from this enrichment analysis, we have detected several important lung's overall functionality related processes only for the deregulated genes from the lung of COVID-19 patient, namely-lung development, pulmonary surfactant metabolism disease or dysfunction, respiratory processes, regulation of respiratory gaseous exchange etc. along with some antiviral responses (Figure 2, Supplementary figure 3). We have also exported enriched genes list of selected significantly enriched terms in color coded heatmaps. Intriguingly, while equating the expression of these enriched genes, we discovered that the genes of these key lung related processes are significantly altered in SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs compared to the SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells and SARS-CoV infection (Supplementary figure 4).",

Pro-SFTPB and Pro-SFTPC are cleaved NAPSA, CTSH, PGA3-5 for producing active SFTPB and SFTPC[59,60] but in the COVID-19 affected lung NAPSA was found deregulated(Figure 3) while the rest other enzymes were not found to be significantly differentially expressed (data not shown). Overall, the transcription of the surfactant genes, production of active surfactant proteins, and their turnover might be deregulated in the lung of the COVID-19 patient which could have result in the severe disease complicacies leading to their death. As these mechanisms are found to be aberrantly modulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infections, virus might be positively facilitating these anomalies.Host proteins those interact with virus are involved in different respiratory functions related pathways and diseasesIn previously reported human coronavirus infections, SARS and MERS coronaviruses are often found to takeover host machineries, suppressing host immune responses and other important biological processes for their continued existence inside the infected cells[61]. We have performed functional enrichment analyses using the previously reported host proteins which can interact with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins[33][34][35] to have better understanding in which pathways these proteins are involved and if there any connection with lung degenerative processes -a common complication that we observe in corona infected patient.Upon the enrichment analyses, as expected, we observed several immune signaling pathways like-interleukin signaling, interferon signaling, apoptosis, inflammasomes etc. for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figure 4A, 4C); however, this approach also revealed some vital pathways related to respiratory functions like-HIF-1 signaling, hypoxic and oxygen homeostasis regulation of HIF-1 alpha etc (Figure 4A, 4C). Several respiratory complications related pathways like-lung diseases, asthma, hyperoxia, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension etc. were found to be enriched from DisGenNet database module[41] (Figure 4B). All these enlighten that SARS-CoV-2 might be utilizing its proteins in modulating the host lung's normal physiological and immune responses which can be further explored by linking these viral-host protein-protein interactions (PPI) in our previously identified essential lung processes.SARS-CoV-2 proteins and host epigenetic regulators can modulate the functionality of lung and other respiratory processesAs we have discovered that both deregulated genes in COVID-19 affected lung and SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins are involved in different important respiratory functionalities, we then produced several functional networks with these deregulated genes, viral protein-host protein interactions, and host's epigenetic regulators involved in those processes to shed insights on viral infection mediated deregulations and their resultant pathophysiological effects in COVID-19. We have mainly targeted four broad biological processes which can significantly affect the COVID-19 patients upon any dysregulation, namely-response to hypoxia, lung development, respiratory processes, and surfactant metabolism.",

ORF9c can modulate EDNRA indirectly through F2RL1 (Figure 5). PML functions might be altered through viral N-host MOV10 proteins' interaction. Functions of SLCBA1 can be modulated by NSP13 through PRKACA (Figure 5). NSP7 can regulate ALDH3A1 which can affect CYP1A1 and NR4A2 (Figure 5). NSP5 interacting HDAC2 can curb PML and REST functionalities (Figure 5). NSP12 can modulate the a wide range of hypoxia functions related proteins like-TGFBR2, MECP2, MTHFR, CBFA2T3, EGR1, ANGPTL4 by interacting with the transcription factor TCF12 (Figure 5). NSP12 can deregulate the functions of CFLAR through RIPK1 interactions (Figure 5). Apart from these several host miRNAs can possibly also downregulate the expression of some genes, namely-miR-320a, miR-3188, miR-3661, miR-217, miR-421 and miR-429 (Figure 5). These viral mediated deviations found in the hypoxia responses might be a decisive factor behind the lung injury found in COVID-19 patients [63]. In the lung development network, viral protein NSP13 are found to indirectly target RC3H2, SOX9, GLI3 through CEP350, PRKACA, PRKAR2A proteins (Figure 6). While GLI3 can also be modulated through several viral-host interactions like-ORF10-RBX1, NSP5-HDAC2, M-PSMD8 interaction axis (Figure 6). ORF8 can indirectly modulate ADAMTS2, CHI3L1, NOTCH1, TCF12, FLT4 etc (Figure 6).

Host miRNAs miR-421 are found to be downregulating LMCD1; while miR-137, miR-375, miR-429 fail to modulate CCDC59 and GATA6 because of their probable inactivation/suppression by differential expression of its regulating TFs (Figure 8).
