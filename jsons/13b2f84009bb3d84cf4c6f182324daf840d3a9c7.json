Due to my training as a geriatrician and having an interest in an integrated style of medicine, I feel my non psychiatric medical skills have been of help and avoid overburdening the primary care physicians. Of note, these evaluations occur through telehealth and my experience with this modality and existing therapeutic relationship with these patients, determines the success of this intervention.",

This is a frequent observation by psychiatrists especially geriatricians and this pandemic has further illuminated it. Psychiatrists with dual training in medicine and psychiatry have noted that it makes them better physicians with better diagnostic skills. (1) To that end, integrated care training for psychiatrists, during their training years might be beneficial. (2) It is also important to impart training in telehealth pertinent to communication, evaluation and accurate diagnosing within the limitations of this modality. Scope of practice definitions as well as extent of liability may be modified accordingly.",
