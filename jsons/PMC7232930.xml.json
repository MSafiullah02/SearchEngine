The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in Italy ranged from mild to critical cases, with lethality variability across regions, being higher in Northern Italy, in a possible association with atmospheric pollution [2]. While public health is promoting any measure to limit the transmission of the disease, in-hospital daily clinical activity is called for a fast reorganization to adapt to the healthcare emergency [3]. As a general directive, units uncapable of respiratory intensive care, including cardiac electrophysiology (EP), are often forced either to significantly reduce volume loads or completely interrupt their activity. However, redirection of resources is widely variable, depending on both COVID-19 local case load and specific activities qualifying certain hospitals as referral centers in a pre-existing \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d network. Our EP unit plays as a referral center for a number of procedures, including ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation or cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) extraction; activity was rapidly reorganized to favor the minimal risk-to-benefit ratio. We describe the COVID-19 outbreak impact on daily clinical practice at a referral EP center.",

However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO)-supported procedures were kept to a minimum: this strategy allowed for sparing both ICU beds and anesthesiology personnel, as a maximal priority at a COVID-19 referral center. Conversely, ablation of all supraventricular arrhythmias, including AF, atrial flutter, and tachycardia, as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, was no more performed, unless in life-threatening conditions (i.e., pre-excited AF) or in patients suffering from multiple drug-refractory inappropriate shocks.

For instance, we performed ICD implant in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy, diffuse areas of late gadolinium enhancement, and recurrent episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia with lypothimia. Also, we performed CRT-D implant in a patient with left bundle branch block, following repeated in-hospital admissions for decompensated heart failure.

Of course, device replacement following end-on-life battery status was regularly performed, with usual priority given to pacemaker (PM)-dependent patients and ICD carriers with recent history of appropriate shocks. Conversely, the majority of ILR and percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure interventions were interrupted. In compelling cases, as for inpatients with cryptogenic stroke and no evidence of AF on telemetry, ILR was directly implanted at bedside. To further minimize contact, alternative forms of long-term external monitoring were considered whenever applicable [17, 18].
