Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype coronavirus, is an important pathogen in laboratory animals (Baker, 2003), and the genetics and pathogenesis of this virus have been studied extensively (Masters, 2006, Siddell, 1995). The genomic RNA of MHV is about 30 kb long with a 5\u2032-cap and a 3\u2032-poly A tail. MHV produces seven subgenomic (sg) RNAs in infected cells (Goebel et al., 2004, Spaan et al., 2005). sgRNA1 is equivalent to the genomic RNA and encodes the replicase. sgRNA2 is responsible for the expression of open reading frame (ORF) 2a and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE), sgRNA3 for the spike (S) protein, sgRNA4 for ORFs 4a and 4b, sgRNA5 for ORF 5a and the envelope (E) protein, sgRNA6 for the membrane (M) protein and sgRNA7 for the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Masters, 2006, Siddell, 1995, Spaan et al., 2005).",

Studies show that deletion of MHV gene 4 has no effect on viral replication in cells or on viral pathogenesis in mice (de Haan et al., 2002, Ontiveros et al., 2001). Gene 2a is believed to have been acquired horizontally from sequences encoding cellular or viral 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphodiesterases (Mazumder et al., 2002). HE is a typical transmembrane glycoprotein related to the haemagglutinin of influenza C virus (Snijder et al., 2003) and acts as a cofactor of the S protein in the binding of virus to cells and in the release of virus from cells (Lissenberg et al., 2005). Thus, replacement of MHV genes 2/HE and 4 with foreign genes allows the possibility of using MHV as an expression vector (de Haan et al., 2003, Enjuanes et al., 2001).",

For example, the A59 strain causes primarily moderate hepatitis and can persistently infect the central nervous system when inoculation occurs via the nasal or brain routes (Perlman and Butler, 2008, Stohlman et al., 1998). The JHM strain, on the other hand, is associated with severe fatal encephalitis and severe neurovirulence (Perlman and Butler, 2008, Stohlman et al., 1998, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). It was found that the partial deletion of the endodomain of the MHV S protein decreased syncytium formation dramatically, but there was no significant reduction in the level of viral replication in L2 cells (Ye et al., 2004). Thus, the S mutation might attenuate the toxicity of MHV when it is used as a vector for foreign protein expression. In this study, some features of recombinant MHVs with the S mutation were examined in cultured cells, including replication phenotypes, tropism for murine cell lines and expression of foreign proteins. The eukaryotic DNA expression vector pIRES2\u2013EGFP was used as a control for the distribution of foreign proteins.",

Masters\u2019 Laboratory (Das Sarma et al., 2002, Hurst et al., 2005). A fragment with a 14-aa deletion (Fig. 1A) of a cysteine-rich motif in the S endodomain of MHV was amplified by splicing overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) (Aiyar et al., 1996, Ye et al., 2004). The fragment was inserted into pMH54 between the Mlu I and Sbf I sites to produce pMH-S\u0394CR (Fig. 1B). This fragment was also inserted into pMH54GFP with the same restriction enzymes to construct an intermediate clone. Then, a restriction fragment from pHKP1 between Rsr II and Avr II was inserted into the intermediate clone to construct the triple mutant pMH-H/S/G (Fig. 1B). In pHKP1, the 2a and HE genes of MHV were replaced with a membrane-anchored fusion protein (HK) in which the signal peptide and the ectodomain were from the pHook1 vector (Invitrogen) and the transmembrane domain and the endodomain were from the S protein of MHV A59 (Ye et al., 2004). To construct a eukaryotic expression vector, an HK fragment from pHKP1 was cut out by EcoR V and Asc I. The fragment was blunted with Klenow and inserted into the Sma I site of the pIRES2\u2013EGFP vector (Clontech, BD Bioscience).",

MHV recombinants were produced following the procedure of targeted RNA recombination (Kuo et al., 2000, Masters and Rottier, 2005). Briefly, donor RNA transcription vectors were digested by Pac I and transcribed into mRNAs using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra kit (Ambion). The mRNAs were then transfected into FCWF cells that had been infected previously (2 h) with an engineered fMHV. The transfection was conducted using one pulse at a setting of 975 \u03bcF and 0.3 kV with a Gene Pulser XceII electroporation system (Bio-Rad). The infected/transfected FCWF cells were overlaid onto L2 monolayers. Culture supernatants containing recombinant viruses were collected from 24 to 72 hpi. Recombinant viruses were purified by two rounds of single-plaque-picking on L2 cells. The identities of the recombinant viruses were verified by RT-PCR and sequencing.",

Similarly, the CPE of the recombinant viruses was used to divide the viruses into two groups: MHV-EGFP and MHV-HK formed typical syncytia similar to MHV-WT, and MHV-S\u0394CR and MHV-H/S/G did not produce significant CPE (Fig. 2C). The expressed EGFP was directly examined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2D).

The time-course experiments showed that the peak expression of HK proteins in L2 cells by mutant S viruses (MHV-H/S/G) was delayed about 20 h. Peak expression occurred at 36 hpi for the mutant S viruses, while the peak expression of the wild-type S virus (MHV-HK) occurred at 16 hpi; the amount of protein expressed at the time of peak expression was not significantly different between the two mutants (Fig. 2F).",

The extracellular part of S2, which contains a fusion peptide and two heptad repeat (HR1 and HR2) domains, is involved in membrane fusion. The C-terminal part of S2, which contains the transmembrane domain and the intracellular domain (endodomain), is involved in viral assembly and membrane fusion. There is a unique cysteine-rich motif in the S endodomain of most coronaviruses. In MHV A59, this motif contains nine cysteines (Fig. 1A). This motif has been demonstrated to play an important role in cell\u2013cell fusion during syncytium formation induced by the S protein, which might be associated with the palmitoylation of these cysteine residues (Bos et al., 1995, Chang et al., 2000, Thorp et al., 2006).",

However, alanine-scanning experiments demonstrated that a single cysteine mutation did not influence viral replication or CPE; effects were only observed when three cysteines were mutated simultaneously (data not shown). Further deletion mutations revealed that the number of cysteines present has a substantial influence on the replication of recombinant viruses: fewer than two is lethal, three allows survival and more than four allows the virus to replicate in L2 cells normally (data not shown). In MHV-S\u0394CR, 14 residues were deleted, and 4 cysteines remained (Fig. 1A). The changes in the CPE and plaque formation in L2 cells induced by the partial deletion of the S endodomain might be the result of a decrease in cell\u2013cell membrane fusion. The efficient replication of recombinant viruses with the S mutation in L2 cells might result from the reduced interference in virus\u2013cell membrane fusion during viral entry. Although the deletion delayed the expression of HK and EGFP in L2 cells, the amounts of both foreign proteins were almost equal to those expressed by wild-type S viruses (Fig. 2F). One possible advantage of this mutated MHV as an expression vector is that the infected cells maintained normal morphology for at least 72 h. Conversely, L2 cells infected with wild-type S viruses formed significant syncytia at 8 h and became broken and detached from the culture surfaces within 24 h (data not shown). Apart from the palmitoylation of cysteine residues in the S endodomain, the deleted residues might also be involved in the trafficking of the S protein to the plasma membrane through recruiting distinct cellular cofactors.",

Rat or mouse cell lines such as L2, 17Cl1 and DBT are typically used in multiplication and other experiments with MHV (Das Sarma et al., 2002, de Haan et al., 2002, de Haan et al., 2003, Enjuanes et al., 2001, Hurst et al., 2005, Kuo et al., 2000, Masters and Rottier, 2005, Ontiveros et al., 2001, Ye et al., 2004). Here, two mouse cell lines, NIH/3T3 and Neuro-2A, were used to assess the replication and foreign protein expression of recombinant viruses. The results showed that multiplication and foreign protein expression of MHV-S\u0394CR and MHV-H/S/G in both NIH/3T3 and Neuro-2A cells decreased significantly (Fig. 3B). However, the multiplication and foreign protein expression of the wild-type S viruses (MHV-HK and MHV-EGFP) in both cell lines did not show a significant decrease, but the CPE was delayed about 12 h compared to infection in L2 cells. The decreased foreign protein expression might be attributed to the low level of viral replication because the expression of HK or EGFP was efficient in cells infected with MHV-HK or MHV-EGFP. Similar results were also obtained in 17Cl1 and DBT cells (data not shown). However, the infectivity of these cells, even though there was a 2- to 3-log reduction, indicated that the S-mutated recombinant virus maintained the ability to infect multiple tissues including the central nervous system of mouse models. Further experiments using animal models of infection with the viruses are needed. Moreover, in both NIH/3T3 and Neuro-2A cells, expression of EGFP was found to be better than that of HK (Fig. 3). The differences in expression were related to their genomic locations in MHV. Downstream genes (EGFP) are expressed earlier than upstream genes (HK). This difference in the expression timeline might result from the transcription sequence of the subgenomic mRNAs of coronaviruses (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998).",

For eukaryotic expression vectors, DNA is transferred first into cellular nuclei and then initiates RNA transcription by the IE promoter of CMV. RNAs are then transferred to the cytoplasmic matrix for protein translation. In the pIRES2-EGFP-HK vector, the target HK gene was cloned upstream of EGFP, and the two genes were linked with the EMCV IRES sequence. Although the transcription and translation mechanisms are very different between the recombinant coronaviruses and eukaryotic expression vectors, the distributions of foreign proteins expressed by both viruses and plasmids were shown to be consistent and correct. The correct location of the two proteins was confirmed by confocal microscopy: HK is membrane associated, and EGFP is cytoplasmic (Fig. 4). However, the membrane-associated localisation of HK in L2 and Neuro-2a cells was different as viewed by microscopy (Fig. 4C). This difference might result from the assembly of HK proteins in virus particles in infected cells through an interaction between the HK endodomain and the viral M and N proteins (Ye et al., 2004). In transfected cells, the proteins may be transferred quickly to the plasma membrane.",
