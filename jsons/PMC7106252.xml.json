They also suggested that those in close contact with someone who either traveled to that region or has somehow been exposed to the virus (ie, camel farm or slaughterhouse) are also at risk. Persons with severe disease or chronic illness, or who are immunocompromised, are also at increased risk for exposure and infection. These persons should take precautions when traveling to the Middle East or Arabian Peninsula, or when coming in close contact with an infected individual traveling from that region.1, 5 Precautions should include frequent hand washing, avoiding touching mucous membranes, avoiding any close contact with persons who are ill, and following up on all immunizations about 4 to 6 weeks before travel.6 WHO suggests that the increase in outbreak in a number of hospital-acquired cases may be related to a lack of proper infection control and prevention measures.1 Health-care workers should always use standard precautions, specifically droplet precautions in cases of acute respiratory illness of unknown etiology. Presently, CDC and WHO do not advise any special screening or travel restrictions, but only encourage standard precaution and vigilance.",

It is necessary to identify the clinical manifestation of the disease for proper management, because, in rare cases, this disease may rapidly progress to septic shock or fatal multiorgan failure.7 Common symptomology includes fever, chills/rigor, headaches, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, malagia, and coryza type. Associated gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting may also be present. Low-risk/uncomplicated patients who develop cold-like symptoms were found to recover fairly quickly. Immunocompromised patients, or patients with pre-existing medical conditions, including diabetes, cancers, and chronic lung, heart, or kidney disease, were more at risk for more severe complications, hospitalization, and admissions to the intensive care unit.8 Although transmission of the disease is time limited, there is currently no research suggesting ongoing spread into the community.9\n",
