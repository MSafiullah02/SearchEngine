The approach is more sensitive and specific than the visualization of TZANCK cells and a specific diagnosis can be made earlier in the infection (Arvin & Prober 1999). In this test, the smears taken and applied to clinical laboratory slides, after fixation in 95% ethanol, were stained with a 1\u20132000 dilution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) of monoclonal antibodies to HSV\u20101or HSV\u20102 (DAKO Corp, Carpinteria, CA, USA) that had been conjugated with fluorescein. Staining was for 20 min. in a moist chamber at room temperature. The viral antigen was evaluated for evidence of the HSV\u20101 or \u20102 antigens following several washings with PBS using fluorescence microscopy.",
