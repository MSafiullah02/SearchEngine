I have been involved with Simon Ray (BCS President), Alistair Slade (President Elect, HRS) and Nick Linker (National Clinical Director for Heart Disease) and a number of others around the UK, with the aim of providing some definitive recommendations about optimal PPE for such cases. These recommendations were released a few days ago,[4] and have been endorsed by NHS England and PHE, as being complementary to their recent updated general PPE guidance. I am pleased to reproduce the important part of this cath lab PPE guidance here. Our recommendations are shown in Table 1.",
