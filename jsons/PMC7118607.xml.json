The authors describe pragmatic approaches to the challenges of delivering ECMO to patients with COVID-19, including training health-care personnel, resolving equipment and facilities issues, implementing systems for infection control and personal protection, providing overall support for health-care staff, and mitigating ethical issues. They also address some of the anticipated challenges with local and regional surges in COVID-19 ARDS cases; although there has been an increase in hospitals with the capacity to provide ECMO, the potential demand might exceed the available resources. Furthermore, some health-care systems offer advanced therapies such as ECMO but lack a coordinated local, regional, or national referral protocol.",

This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide.4 WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers.5\n",

If the hypoxaemia progresses to a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of less than 100\u2013150 mm Hg, there are several therapeutic options. The level of positive end-expiratory pressure can be increased by 2\u20133 cm H2O every 15\u201330 min to improve oxygen saturation to 88\u201390%, with the goal of maintaining a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H2O. Lower driving pressures (plateau airway pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure) with a target of 13\u201315 cm H2O can also be used. If the patient is not responding to adjustment of the level of positive end-expiratory pressure, additional strategies might stabilise them. Recruitment manoeuvres probably have little value,6 but moderate pressures of approximately 30 cm H2O for 20\u201330 s can be applied in the presence of a physician to monitor haemodynamics. If there is no improvement in oxygenation or driving pressure, or if the patient develops hypotension or barotrauma, the recruitment manoeuvres should be discontinued. If there is considerable dyssynchrony with positive pressure ventilation, accompanied by increased plateau airway pressures and refractory hypoxaemia, then deep sedation should be used followed by prompt institution of neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium. Additionally, prone positioning should be instituted, unless there is a specific contraindication, and can be initiated along with the interventions already described.",

Inhaled 5\u201320 ppm NO might improve oxygenation. Insertion of an oesophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures to set an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure can be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe obesity, although a 2019 trial in patients with ARDS did not show the benefit of this procedure in most patients.7 Fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema.8 In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0\u00b75 to 1\u00b70 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria. Antibiotics should be considered since secondary bacterial infections have been reported in patients with COVID-19.9 Glucocorticoids should be avoided in view of the evidence that they can be harmful in cases of viral pneumonia and ARDS from influenza.10 Rescue therapy with high-dose vitamin C can also be considered.11 Finally, ECMO should be considered using the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial.3\n",
