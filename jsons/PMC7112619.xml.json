            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the arguably one of the greatest threats to global human health and is driven by the overuse of antibiotics.1 Antibiotics are prescribed to the vast majority of patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness (ARI), including in clinical groups where viruses are strongly implicated in their aetiology. Most asthma exacerbations are associated with respiratory virus infection, especially rhinovirus2 and randomised controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any benefit from antibiotic treatment.3, 4 Additionally, a large retrospective observational study of nearly 20,000 patients hospitalised with an exacerbation suggests that antibiotic use does not improve outcome and is associated with higher costs.5 Professional societies strongly discourage the use of antibiotics in asthma exacerbation through national guidelines6, 7 but despite this antibiotic use in adults hospitalised with exacerbation of asthma remains very common.8, 9, 10 Patients hospitalised with exacerbation of COPD are also routinely treated with antibiotics despite viruses being frequently implicated in their aetiology12 and a lack of high quality evidence for benefit in patients with non-life threatening exacerbations.11 Several randomised trials of biomarker-directed therapy show that antibiotics use can be safely reduced in non-critically ill hospitalised patients with exacerbation of COPD and low levels of CRP or procalcitonin13, 14 supporting the concept that antibiotics are currently overused in this population. Diagnostic uncertainty regarding the aetiology of exacerbations of airways disease contributes to the ongoing overuse of antibiotics in these groups.",

Subgroup analysis from the trial suggests that these antibiotic changes occurred predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease testing positive for viruses, with little difference seen in antibiotic use in other clinical groups such as patients with community acquired pneumonia or in patients testing negative for viruses. Several observational studies support the findings of ResPOC, demonstrating a reduction in unnecessary antibiotics with rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in a variety of clinical setting.15, 16 In addition a post hoc analysis from the trial itself suggests that the very rapid turnaround times for results seen with POCT compared to laboratory testing are critical in modifying antibiotic use in hospitalised patients.17\n",

Rapid, accurate influenza detection is clearly a priority for hospitals during periods of intense influenza transmission, to correctly and rapidly administer influenza antivirals and to efficiently utilise infection control facilities. In addition multiplex syndromic panels are more expensive than uniplex tests for influenza and it is not currently clear what additional clinical value is gained by testing for the other virus types in hospitalised patients.",

            "text": "This study shows that syndromic molecular POCT for respiratory viruses in adults presenting to hospital with exacerbation of airways disease, leads to a reduction in antibiotic use due to early discontinuation in those testing positive for viruses. Most viruses detected in these patients were non-influenza viruses with rhino/enterovirus being the most commonly detected single virus type, and there was no difference in the rate of antibiotic discontinuation between different virus types. As noted in the ResPOC study, POCT did not lead to a reduction in the proportion treated with antibiotics compared to routine clinical care however this is unsurprising as patients are started on antibiotics very early in their patient journey when admitted to hospital and this was often before the results of POCT can be made available. The reason that antibiotics are stopped early in patients with exacerbation of airways disease testing positive for viruses is unknown but is likely to be due to clinicians feeling the detection of a virus adequately explains their acute illness and giving them confidence that a bacterial infection is unlikely and no longer needs to be \u2018covered\u2019 with antibiotics, in combination with other data such as CRP level and radiology results.",

This suggests that for patients with exacerbation of airways disease respiratory virus testing should be performed at the point-of-care using a comprehensive syndromic multiplex panel rather than a molecular POCT for influenza alone, which would not detect the majority of viruses associated with early antibiotic discontinuation. It could be argued that for many of the patients in the study treated with antibiotics that they should not have been treated in any case, on clinical grounds alone, given that antibiotic use in patients with asthma exacerbation is already strongly discouraged by national society guidelines. However, despite these guidelines inappropriate antibiotic use in hospitalised patients with asthma remains very common8, 9, 10 and diagnostic uncertainty regarding the possibility of bacterial infection, especially in the early part of hospital admission before all diagnostic information is available, is likely to be a key driver of this practice. The early provision of accurate results regarding exacerbation aetiology seems to assist in rational antibiotic decision making and is a potential alternative or complementary strategy to biomarker-directed therapy.",

            "text": "There are additional reasons beyond the antibiotic stewardship benefits for choosing to test using a comprehensive syndromic POCT for a range of respiratory viruses rather than with a POCT for influenza alone. Although some molecular POCT platforms for influenza have diagnostic accuracy comparable to laboratory PCR, others have demonstrated inferior sensitivity in non-industry sponsored, real world studies20 potentially reducing their usefulness in the hospital setting where missed diagnoses have serious consequences including nosocomial transmission of influenza. Although influenza may represent a priority for hospital infection control teams during peak influenza season, the detection of other respiratory viruses is also important for infection control purposes as other viruses also pose a serious risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreaks, which are especially dangerous to immunocompromised patients in certain high risk areas such as haematology wards and renal units. In some hospitals a two-step testing process is adopted where a patient with a negative influenza POCT is then tested using a multiplex laboratory PCR, increasing costs and prolonging the time before result are available compared with a comprehensive syndromic POCT. Regulatory consideration are also important and rapid diagnostic platforms may not be able to be used at the POCT in certain countries due to regulatory requirements, for example the current FilmArray system is not fully CLIA waived in the US. A further significant consideration is obviously the higher cost associated with syndromic panels versus molecular POCT for influenza and there is clearly a need for health economic studies to provide evidence for the cost effectives of such an approach considering the incremental benefits of syndromic testing.",

Although it is likely to be generalisable to other centres we cannot rule out that the changes seen are dependent on the processes of care in UK hospitals. It is also currently uncertain as to how molecular POCT for respiratory viruses should be best implemented within the NHS and other health systems. Potential models include training clinical staff to perform the testing or the development of dedicated point-of-care testing laboratories staffed by technicians and located within, or close to, acute areas.21\n",
