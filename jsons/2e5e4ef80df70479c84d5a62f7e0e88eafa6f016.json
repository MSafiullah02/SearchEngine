            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-6 is a critical driver of acute and chronic inflammation. During inflammation, IL-6 signaling drives T cell survival, expansion and proliferation. 4 Moreover, IL-6 signaling promotes a pro-tumorigenic immune-suppressive network. 5 Compared to the other available selective IS, the anti-IL-6R agent TCZ offers several strategic advantages without the risk of compromising immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. 6 In addition, it carries complementary anti-tumor properties, because IL-6 blockade significantly improves the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into IFN-\u03b3-producing effector Th1 cells. 7 Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the IL-6-Th-17 pathway may have an important role in the pathogenesis of irAEs, especially in steroid-refractory cases. 8, 9 IL-17A-expressing CD4 + T cells (c-Kit \u2212 CD161 + MDR1 + Th17 cells) have been reported as key effectors of autoimmune inflammation refractory to glucocorticoids. 8 The pathogenic effect of IL-6 is essential in the differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th-17 cells from na\u00efve CD4 + T cells, which might suggest a role for this Th17 subset in steroid-refractory irAEs. 10 Another important report showed that among adults receiving chimeric antigen receptor T cells, early administration of TCZ to treat the cytokine release syndrome was associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular events. 11 Recently, an approach of blocking the IL-6/IL-6R axis using TCZ suggested a promising immuno-modulatory therapeutic strategy and could be beneficial to avoid rapid clinical deterioration from severe forms of COVID-19. 12 Very interestingly, what we have noticed in our fragile patient is that he remained pauci-symptomatic despite having become COVID-19 positive during long immunosuppression. This observation could suggest a possible additional beneficial effect for TCZ on the clinical courseCOVID-19. In our patient, the use of tocilizumab led to the rapid resolution of the refractory high-grade myocarditis, allowing a significant reduction in the total duration of immunosuppression. The patient began receiving methylprednisolone sodium succinate at a dose of 1 g daily for one day, followed by a dose of 200 mg daily with initial improvement of biochemical variables.",

The patient was then progressively weaned from corticosteroids and did not experience any recurrence of cardiac, myositis or HPS adverse events. \u2021 High-sensitivity troponin T is expressed by skeletal muscle, including regenerating skeletal muscle tissue whereas highsensitivity troponin I is specific to the myocardium. 3, 13 As reported before 3 , given that the patient had severe myositis related to immunotherapy, the high-sensitivity troponin T concentration reflected active skeletal muscle regeneration rather than active myocarditis in the context of normalization of the high-sensitivity troponin I concentration and creatine kinase level. 3 CK, creatine kinase; d, day ; hs, high-sensitivity; IV, intravenous; MP, methylprednisolone sodium succinate pulse; PDN, prednisone; TCZ, tocilizumab; ; us, ultra-sensitivity ; ",

            "text": "TO THE EDITOR. Despite multiple available immunosuppression methods, refractory immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis remains a life-threatening toxicity associated with a high mortality of around 40% as well as severe infectious complications.1 Here we report a case of a 57-year-old male receiving third-line treatment with a combination of checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab and ipilimumab) for metastatic lung small-cellneuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC), stage IIIB. Before receiving the third treatment cycle, he presented a muscular weakness of the lower limbs with dyspnea of sudden onset associated with an oppressive retrosternal chest pain without syncope and a ptosis of the right eye with diplopia. He subsequently developed severe arrhythmias and 3 rd -grade atrioventricular block. Elevated concentrations of high-sensitivity troponins I and T, creatine kinase (CK), ferritin (Figure 1) and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography PET/CT with Ga-68-DOTATOC confirmed the diagnosis of generalized myositis complicated by myocarditis and ocular myositis (Figure S1). The left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved and coronary angiography showed normal arteries. A very broad infectious and myasthenia panel was negative. A myocarditis-myositis overlap syndrome was diagnosed and a pacemaker was placed. He received methylprednisolone sodium succinate pulse therapy at a dose of 1 g per day for one day followed by a dose of 200 mg per day for 5 days. Despite the repeated administrations of high intravenous methylprednisolone over a 1week period, the patient's troponin I, T, CK levels increased quickly as well as the ferritin level (from 1291 to 18522 \u00b5g/l) (Figure 1). The HScore was 211 points with a 93-96% probability for associated reactive Hemophagocytic Syndrome (HPS). Intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) (at a dose of 8 mg per kilogram of body weight weekly for two doses) was administered. The troponin T/I, CK, ferritin levels and inflammatory parameters rapidly decreased(Figure 1). The ejection fraction remained normal, and symptoms of myocarditis (arrhythmias) and myositis (muscular weakness and pain) progressively disappeared.",
