Subsequently, we patiently wait for the administration to decide whether our various expenses can be deemed refundable. From our own personal experience, we feel that the entire process of reporting expenses and claiming reimbursements for travelling and meeting colleagues has been deteriorating over the past couple of years in terms of productivity and efficiency. Naturally, some administrations are more effective than others, yet overall the bureaucracy has been increasing to unreasonable levels that requireand waste-a huge amount of time and energy for budgeting, planning and payments [1] .",

Travelling to a meeting or conference might sound like fun to accountants, but science travel is a serious responsibility, a career non-option and indeed a mission. Scientists risk health incidents, from sharp or emerging epidemicssuch as SARS or the ongoing COVID-19-to long-term health effects-notably DVT, red tape issues, such as visas and border checks, and weather-related snags, such as dreadful delays, time away from home with whatever this entails [2] , hidden yet real costs that cannot be directly reported and even serious life-threatening situations [3] . One of us was hospitalised abroad with a serious influenza episode and the other with a serious infection manifesting symptoms onboard a transcontinental flight. We can remember other dire moments: a colleague who passed away from DVT as a frequent flyer across continents, confusing protocols over passports/ IDs, visa waivers or the \"Schengen Treaty,\" violent storms or volcanic eruptions grounding our flights for days in North America or Europe, sacrificing another precious weekend with the family for a dull meeting at a remote location, thousands of euros, pounds and dollars that were \"not acceptable\" for reimbursement, occasions of political instability and all kinds of minor or less minor accidents.",

It is time to realise that science travel is an assignment that needs to be carried out, often under adverse conditions, and not some happy opportunity to escape from the office. Most scientists are passionate and creative professionals who enjoy meetings as a way to interact and discuss their research and not as an extra vacation. Such a realistic view should inform the mentality and procedures of auditing and expense claims. For example, an aggressive, generous and precise per diem system for research groups works well in the United States [6] and helps to diminish frustration and costs. Another productive solution in terms of reimbursement policy would be self-managed travel budgets under the PI's responsibility. Ideally, we would envisage a more flexible framework with pre-paid credit cards; fully booked travel itineraries with the help of dedicated staff;",
