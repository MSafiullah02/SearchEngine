To date, multiple recombinations and non-synonymous mutations have been identified in clinical specimens with the majority in Spike, Matrix, ORF1ab and ORF4b [2\u20135], but only eight deletion variants have been identified in viruses isolated from humans. All of the deletion variants have been in accessory and structural proteins. The identified deletions have been present in spike, ORF3a, ORF4, ORF5 and between ORF5 and E generating an ORF5E fusion protein [6\u201310]. Of note, the accessory proteins ORF4 and ORF5 are unique to Group 2C Beta coronaviruses and thus are absent in the other highly pathogenic Beta coronaviruses. None of the deletion variants identified in humans have been characterized in vitro, but the 414 nt deletion variant in ORF5 and E was identified in the index patient in China that had close contact with the index patient in South Korea in 2015 who was later deemed as a \u2018super-spreader\u2019 upon starting an outbreak that infected 186 people [7]. A 20 nt ORF5 deletion variant was identified from a fatal case occurred in 2015, linked to nosocomial transmission in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [8]. Notably, deletion variants, with deletions in ORF3 and/or ORF4b have also been identified in specimens collected from dromedary camels in West and North Africa, which are phylogenetically distinct from viruses isolated from the Arabian Peninsula [11].",

The full genome or spike gene of the novel isolates and the matched clinic samples were sequenced, phylogenetic analysis was performed, and sequences were compared to the sequences from the corresponding clinical specimens to identify potential tissue-culture adaptations.

The initial description of the sequences from these clinical specimens described these viral sequences as novel recombinant clade, however we have since adopted lineage language for clarity [2]. Of the eight isolates, five had full-length genomes, and three had genomic deletions. Four isolates with full-length genomes were isolated from clinical specimens in which the full genomes were sequenced. Six isolates had identical sequences in comparison to the available sequences (full genome or spike gene) of their matched clinical samples (Table 1), indicating no tissue-culture adaptations.

Notably, these viruses were of a distinct clade (clade C1), but still had deletions in a similar region to our isolates from clade B human viruses. The clade C camel MERS viruses replicated less efficiently in Calu-3 cells than the human MERS-CoV isolate, EMC. These deletion mutants exhibited increased type I and III IFN responses with increased mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b31. When the deletion was engineered into a human strain of MERS-CoV (EMC), the viruses also exhibited higher type I and III, but did not exhibit growth inhibition suggesting the deletion is not solely responsible for growth inhibition.

Replication of an engineered quadruple deletion mutant was attenuated Calu3 cells but not in IFN-defective Vero cells, suggesting host response may affect the ability of these deletion mutants to grow [13, 15, 16].
