IBV is an agriculturally important pathogen of poultry and despite routine use of vaccines, variant stains continue to cause outbreaks in field situations (personal observations, King and Cavanagh, 1991; Wang et al., 1993). The continuing emergence of new strains may be explained in part by the apparent common occurance in nature of recombination between IBV strains (Wang et al., 1993, Wang et al., 1994).",

We have recently also demonstrated that the S1 can induce IBV specific CTL responses in the chick (Seo and Collisson, manuscript in preparation). Comparisons of the S1 from a number of distinct IBV strains have identified a hypervariable region (HVR) between 50\u2013150 amino acids from the amino terminus (Cavanagh et al., 1988; Kusters et al., 1989; Wang et al., 1994).",

Supernatants were collected following repeated freeze-thaw cycles of infected cells and viral particles were concentrated after clarifying the supernatant at 8000\u00d7g for 30 min by centrifuging at 100 000\u00d7g for 1 h (Williams et al., 1992). The viral RNA was extracted using the proteinase K/chloroform/phenol method (Sambrook et al., 1989) and reverse transcription of RNA was initiated using the downstream strain specific primers described in Table 1\nfor either Ark99 and Mass41 viruses and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) (Wang et al., 1993). Following the removal of RNA from the hybrids of RNA and newly synthesized first strand cDNA with RNaseH, the remaining single-stranded cDNA was used as template for PCR with homologous and/or heterologous primers.

The products from control experiments showed that homologous primers could amplify viral cDNA of the predicted size from particles isolated from either Ark99 or Mass41 infected cells. No recombinant RTPCR product was detected using heterologous primers with either Mass41 or Ark viral RNA, or with mixture of Ark and Mass41 viral RNAs. Nor was any RTPCR product generated from uninfected cellular RNA using both Ark99 and Mass41 specific primers. However, RTPCR amplified recombinant cDNA products could be detected from the viral RNA of Mass and Ark co-infected CEK cells using both sets of heterologous primers. The amounts of viral RNA used for RNA extraction in the experimental and control groups were equivalent.",

RTPCR generated cDNA bands with the predicted 600 nt size were excised from agarose gels and the DNA extracted with GeneClean (Bio101, Vista, CA). The DNA was sequenced after cloning into a PCR cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The sequence information for the recombinant viruses were compared with the published sequences of the parental strains (Binns et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1993). Cross-over sites in the in vitro generated recombinant viruses were detected within cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 50\u201360 and nucleotides 95\u2013100 of the S1 gene. Recombination in the chimeric RNA derived from in ovo co-infection occurred at about nucleotide 99. These sites lie within the putative recombination `hot spot' indicated from sequencing of the S1 of a number of natural isolates (Wang et al., 1993, Wang et al., 1994). No shifts in homology could be detected within the HVR which extends from nucleotides 160\u2013560. An identical change at nucleotide 52\u201355 (TGCT to CTTG) from our original Ark sequence or the Mass41 sequence occurred in three chimeric molecules (Binns et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1993).

Although the viability of the recombinant viruses was not demonstrated in this study, the experimentally produced S1 gene recombination events resembled the shifts in homology observed in nature (Wang et al., 1993, Wang et al., 1994). The approximate locations of all cross-over sites within chimeric RNA were located between nucleotides 50 and 155 (Fig. 2). Comparisons of sequences from the naturally occurring IBV strains had indicated that cross-over sites were concentrated at the 5\u2032 end of the S1 genes (Wang et al., 1994; unpublished data). A second, less often used site was found close to the 3\u2032 end of S1 (Wang et al., 1993, Wang et al., 1994). Although frequencies of recombination are not known, the fact that the HVR and adjacent downstream 600 or more nucleotides may seldom be targets for cross-over events suggests that the region lying upstream, in fact, is more susceptible for recombination. This region may have structures or sequences that promote polymerase interchange of templates. However, because the additional sequences examined were within the HVR, it is also possible that HVR sequences are not favorable sites for recombination. During the process of synthesizing potential chimeric molecules, the variability of the HVR may prohibit necessary RNA\u2013RNA interactions. For example, released, replicating S1 HVR may not be capable of binding to an HVR of new template. An alternative explanation for the absence of detectable recombination events is that chimeric HVR may be less likely to express functional S1 required for viable virus than other chimeric regions, for example, the initial 155 bases of the S1.",

The Mass serotype vaccines have historically by far been most often used to induce flock immunity and does demonstrate more cross-reactivity with other IBV strains (Sneed et al., 1989). Because the parental sequences of many recombinant, naturally occurring strains are derived from distinct Mass41-like sequences, it is a concern that the vaccine may be contributing to the evolution of new strains (Wang et al., 1994). These studies confirm that, with excessive doses of parental virus used to accelerate the rate of recombination, RNA from a Mass serotype can participate in cross-over events resulting in progeny with sequences of the Mass origin and sequences derived from a second parent with the Ark serotype. These studies, which were not designed to examine virulence of experimentally produced recombinants, did produce a chimeric S1 from a sick chick and one from a healthy chick. The contribution, if any, of these recombination events to the generation of virulent strains can only be determined with further investigations.",

Preliminary studies in which recombinant molecules were detected following transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA from the Gray strain into Mass41 infected embryonic cultured cells have suggested that targeted recombination is also feasible (unpublished data). The capacity for Mass41 strains and Mass vaccines, in particular, to participate in the occurrence of new isolates and the ready experimental generation of Mass41 recombinants in vivo, as well as in vitro and in ovo, may further raise concern about the routine use of live IBV to control disease.
