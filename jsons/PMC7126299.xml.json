A key issue in this field is how to find the threshold of an epidemic outbreak, and the remarkable results have been obtained that the epidemic threshold is a positive value in homogeneous networks  [1], [2], but tends to zero in a wide range of SF (scale-free) networks with large size  [3], [4]. Most of these studies mainly focused on epidemic dynamics in static networks, where each node represents a single individual and the connections between individuals are fixed.",

In this situation, the spatial structure of population and human mobility pattern are two primary elements that need to be considered in understanding large epidemic dynamics. To do this, recently, Colizza et al. studied the basic RD (reaction\u2013diffusion) process in heterogeneous networks where the reaction (infection) takes place in the same node. They assumed that the diffusion rates are unitary or null, and investigated the effect of network topology on the epidemic threshold  [17]. Later, following this line, more realistic mobility patterns (diffusion processes), such as the traffic-dependent mobility pattern, the population-dependent mobility pattern, bidirectional mobility pattern, and recurrent mobility pattern, have been introduced to study epidemic dynamics in social networks by using the RD process  [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. In addition, more recently, Lund et al. have investigated the effects of city-size heterogeneity on epidemic dynamics in a metapopulation where small villages and big cities exist simultaneously with the basic RD process  [23].",

In fact, people generally have awareness and change their behaviors (including canceling their trips) to respond to an epidemic outbreak, and such behavior changes have been proved to affect the network structure and epidemic dynamics  [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. To the best of our knowledge, so far there has been no report, except Ref.  [29], that has explicitly considered the response of the variation of human travel rates in epidemic dynamics. In Ref.  [29], the authors assumed that the human mobility rate is adjusted according to the local epidemic prevalence in the destination subpopulation. In this case, only the probability of human traveling to the infected subpopulation is affected. However, in some other cases, a lethal epidemic outbreak can cause reduction of travel in global scope, not just in local infected regions, because of people fearing to be infected on trips. For example, in 2003, the spread of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in several provinces of China led to a decrease of travel all over the country  [30].",

[29], we introduce a time-varying human mobility pattern to model the time variation of global human travel due to the emergence of an epidemic. In this pattern, human mobility rates are governed by the global epidemic prevalence and the fraction of people who have awareness of the epidemic spreading. In addition, not just by simulation method, we also theoretically explore the impacts of the mobility pattern on metapopulation epidemic dynamics. Interesting results are found as follows: (i) the time-varying mobility pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, but it can slightly lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole; (ii) more importantly, we also find that the pattern can produce different impacts on nodes with different degree, and that there exists a critical degree. For nodes with degree smaller than the critical degree, the pattern produces a positive impact on epidemic mitigation; conversely, for nodes with degree larger than the critical degree, the pattern produces a negative impact on epidemic mitigation.",

The second indicates that the infected nodes are cured and become susceptible again with probability \u03bc.",

[17], here we also consider a random walk, but the mobility rates are related to the global epidemic information that can be easily obtained from mass media in today\u2019s information society. Let Sj(t) and Ij(t) denote the number of susceptible and infected individuals in node j at time step t, respectively. The mobility rates are defined as follows: (2a)dI(t)=1\u2212\u03c91\u2211jIj(t)N(0\u2264\u03c91\u22641),(2b)dS(t)=1\u2212\u03c92\u2211jIj(t)N(0\u2264\u03c92\u22641). The quantity dI(t)(dS(t)) is the mobility rate of the infected (susceptible) individuals at time step t. Coefficient \u03c91(\u03c92) represents the fraction of the infected (susceptible) individuals having awareness of an epidemic spreading. For example, \u03c91=\u03c92=1 indicates that all individuals have awareness; \u03c91=\u03c92=0 means that no one has awareness. Clearly, the mobility rates dI(t) and dS(t) are both time varying when \u03c91\u22600 and \u03c92\u22600. At the same time, they will decrease with the increase of \u03c91,\u03c92, and \u2211jIj(t). This reflects the fact that the more people have awareness, and (or) the higher the epidemic prevalence is, the less people travel.",

It can be seen that the stationary infection density in the Case II pattern is always less than that of the Case I pattern irrespective of the \u03c1 value. This means that the time-varying mobility pattern can slightly mitigate the global epidemic spreading as a whole. Moreover, we also find that, in a certain range of \u03c1 (e.g., 5\u2264\u03c1\u226415 in Fig. 1(a) and 2\u2264\u03c1\u226418 in Fig. 1(b)), the value of \u03c1I/\u03c1 in the Case II pattern is significantly lower than that in the Case I pattern, whereas such difference is very small if parameter \u03c1 does not lie in this range. The main reason for the occurrence of this phenomenon can be explained as follows. On the one hand, when the value of \u03c1 is too small, each node has on average very few individuals. In such a case, a mobility rate change can hardly alter the total average number of contacts. On the other hand, the larger the density of individuals \u03c1 is, the more individuals move among the nodes, and the faster the infected individuals move to most nodes.

It is easy to see from Fig. 4(a)\u2013(d) that there always exists a common point at which the \u03c1S,k values are equal for the two patterns, regardless of the \u03c1 value. Here, we denote the nodes\u2019 degree corresponding to the common point as the critical degree kc. For nodes with degree smaller/larger than kc, the relative density of susceptible individuals \u03c1S,k of the Case II pattern is higher/lower than that of Case I pattern. Moreover, it is noticed that the equation \u03c1S,k+\u03c1I,k=k\u03c1/\u3008k\u3009 is always satisfied for these two cases. So we can derive that the relative density of infected individuals \u03c1I,k of the Case II pattern is lower/higher than that of the Case I pattern for nodes with degree smaller/larger than \u03c1c. This means that kc is a critical threshold with respect to the node degree separating the positive impacts from the negative impacts on epidemic mitigation. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. The nodes with higher degree have more individuals, and this is convenient for epidemic spreading inside those nodes. So the infection densities in the stationary state are higher than those in nodes with lower degree nodes. Compared with the Case I pattern, the Case II pattern can decrease the number of individuals moving among nodes. This will restrain, in some sense, the percolation of infected individuals from high infection density nodes to low ones.",

(11), (11) and (12), we can get the expressions of \u03c1S,k for the Case I pattern and the Case II pattern, respectively. Letting the two expressions be equal, one can derive kc as (see the Appendix for details) (22)kc=\u3008k2\u3009(\u03b71(1\u2212(1\u2212\u03bc)\u03b72)\u2212\u03b72(1\u2212\u03b72))\u3008k\u3009\u03bc\u03b71\u03b72, where \u03b71 and \u03b72 are normalized average infected densities \u03c1I/\u03c1 for the Case I pattern and the Case II pattern, respectively. From Fig. 2, we know that \u03b72 is always less than \u03b71 and tends to \u03b71 when \u03c1 is sufficiently large, which leads to a decrease of the kc value. In the extreme case that \u03b71=\u03b72, the minimum value of kc is derived: kcmin=\u3008k2\u3009\u3008k\u3009. So, we can get kc approximately by using kcmin when \u03c1 is sufficiently large (\u03b72\u2248\u03b71). That is, (23)kc\u2248\u3008k2\u3009\u3008k\u3009.\n",

In this paper, we focus on how the response of reducing mobility rates affects the metapopulation epidemic dynamics. We introduce a time-varying human mobility pattern in which human mobility rates are dynamically changed according to the global prevalence. The impact of the pattern on metapopulation epidemic dynamics is studied. It is found that the time variation of human mobility rates does not alter the epidemic threshold, but it can lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole. More importantly, we have also derived a critical value with respect to the node degree. For nodes with degree smaller than the critical value, our pattern produces a positive effect on epidemic mitigation. Conversely, for nodes with degree larger than the critical value, it produces a negative effect on epidemic mitigation.",
