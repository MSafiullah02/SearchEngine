During the hospitalization, none of her roommates in room 6 suffered from SARS, but the first SARS patient was admitted to room 8 3 days before patient 1 was discharged from the hospital. Two days after her discharge from the hospital, she was readmitted to room 6 again because of fever, chills, and rigors. On admission, she was advised to put on a surgical mask, although she showed no symptom of upper respiratory tract infection other than fever. Her initial chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined right lower zone air-space opacity, which rapidly worsened after admission. She was then transferred to the isolation ward after staying in the original ward for 46 hours. Her 7 roommates were then cohorted for suspected SARS contacts. At the end, she (patient 1) was confirmed to have SARS, and 5 of her 7 roommates were also found to have SARS (Fig 4). The ages of these 5 patients varied from 60 to 74 years.

To minimize transport of potential infectious material, the drainage bags of spent peritoneal dialysate were emptied into the sink of the sluice room of the ward where the patients stayed. All the disconnected drainage bags were recapped to avoid leakage and were kept in a covered container while pending disposal. For IPD, the pails used to receive and hold the spent dialysate were previously filled with 500 mL of hypochlorite solution. Extra precautions were also taken to avoid splashing during the emptying process, after which a large amount of hypochlorite solution was poured into the sink and left for 15 minutes before flushing.
