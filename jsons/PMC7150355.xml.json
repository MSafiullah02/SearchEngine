            "text": "Over the last three decades, Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) has remained the cause of the food-borne salmonellosis pandemic in humans. Epidemiological source-tracking studies have identified contaminated table eggs as the primary risk factor for human infection (Gould et al., 2013). Due to this risk of human infection associated with poultry products, SE also poses a significant challenge to the commercial poultry production. Consequently, experimental SE infections in young and adult chickens have been extensively used to acquire basic information about the epidemiology and pathobiology of SE in this reservoir host. Epidemiological investigations show that, unlike other non-host adapted Salmonella serotypes such as S. Typhimurium, which is isolated from variety of food animal sources, SE is most predominantly isolated from poultry, suggesting that SE has likely evolved to gain significant predilection to the poultry host. Pathobiological investigations in chickens indicate that, unlike other non-host adapted Salmonella serotypes, SE has evolved with the unique ability to efficiently contaminate internal contents of eggs without causing discernible illness in the infected laying hens. S. Enteritidis is also antigenically, phenotypically, and genetically different from other nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) serotypes including the most widely studied S. Typhimurium. Nevertheless, the genetic basis of pathogenesis of SE in the chicken host has only been tangentially investigated. In the following sections, we summarize the infection kinetics of SE in the chicken host and provide an overview of the current understanding of genetic factors underlying SE infection. We also discuss the important knowledge gaps that, if addressed, will improve our understanding of the complex biology of SE in young chickens and in egg laying hens.",

            "text": "The primary route of infection and transmission of SE in chickens is via the feco-oral route. After ingestion, SE frequently colonizes crop (Hargis et al., 1995, Turnbull and Snoeyenbos, 1974), less frequently in proventriculus and duodenum, but most preferentially and persistently in the lower ileum, cecum, and cloaca (Turnbull and Snoeyenbos, 1974). Subsequently, SE invades intestinal epithelium and localizes in the submucosa within 4 h postinfection (Berndt et al., 2007). Invasion occurs via specialized M-cells that sample the intestinal lumen as well as nonphagocytic cells. Intestinal invasion induces inflammation, which is characterized by infiltration of heterophils, macrophages, red blood cells, and other immune cells into the lamina propia and cecal luminal exudate (Macri et al., 1997, Porter and Holt, 1993, Van Immerseel et al., 2002). As inflammation progresses, SE produces virulence factors that aid its survival within macrophages and subsequent systemic spread to colonize internal organs including liver and spleen, and in laying hens this also results in colonization of the RT organs (Berchieri et al., 2001, He et al., 2010, Higgins et al., 2007). Interestingly, the infection kinetics vary markedly depending on the age or type of chickens. Porter and Holt (1993) reported that the intestinal inflammation in the adult laying hens was confined to the cecum, whereas in broiler chickens, cellular infiltrates were also reported in the lamina propia of the small intestine (Quinteiro-Filho et al., 2012). Infection of young chickens with doses as low as 100 CFU at 1 day posthatch can induce long-term intermittent shedding of SE for up to 24 weeks postinfection (Gast and Holt, 1998, Van Immerseel, 2010). In contrast, oral infection of laying hens often results in short-term fecal shedding that may vary from 1 week to up to 6 weeks postinfection (Kinde et al., 2000, Shivaprasad et al., 1990). In very young birds, the internal organ colonization often results in gross pathological changes such as hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with foci of hemorrhages (Kinde et al., 2000). However, in adult chickens including laying hens, the internal organ colonization generally occurs without any overt clinical signs (Hogue et al., 1997, Prevost et al., 2006) and despite efficient colonization of chicken RT organs, egg production appears to remain unaffected or sometimes increases (Fan et al., 2014, Guard-Petter, 2001).",

            "text": "Significant research has focused on the pathogenesis of RT infection in chickens because colonization of RT organs is directly associated with contamination of internal contents of eggs. Formation of different internal components of eggs occurs at different anatomical positions in the avian RT. Thus one of the key questions that have attracted the most attention is, which anatomical part(s) of chicken RT contribute significantly to the contamination of internal contents of eggs before oviposition? Some reports show that egg yolk is frequently and heavily colonized when laying hens are challenged with SE by different routes, pointing to the ovary as the primary source for egg contamination (Bichler et al., 1996, Gast et al., 2002, Gast et al., 2007b). Others have reported that egg albumen is most frequently and heavily colonized, suggesting colonization of oviduct structures as the primary source for contamination of egg contents (Cogan et al., 2004, Reiber and Conner, 1995, Shivaprasad et al., 1990). Systemic spread of different phage types of SE to ovaries was demonstrated in hens experimentally infected via both oral and intravenous routes (Gantois et al., 2008b, Miyamoto et al., 1997). It was suggested that SE is deposited near the basement of the highly vascularized follicular theca wall before migrating through the perivitellin layer and/or attaching and invading ovarian granulosa cells to reach the forming egg yolk (Thiagarajan et al., 1994, Thiagarajan et al., 1996a). Ovarian follicle maturation might also play a role in susceptibility of ovarian granulosa cells to invasion (Howard et al., 2005). In one study, invasion frequency of different phage types of SE in ovarian follicles ranged from 0.016% to 0.034% compared with 0.0003% for Escherichia coli (Dawoud et al., 2011). The contribution of oviduct colonization in internal contamination of the contents of freshly laid eggs has also been extensively investigated. In general, SE is isolated more frequently and in higher counts [colony forming units (CFU) per gram] from isthmus and internal contents of eggs when compared with serotypes such as Heidelberg, Virchow, and Hadar (Gantois et al., 2008b, Okamura et al., 2001). When the laying hens were infected via the intravaginal route, the oviduct (isthmus) and uterus were more frequently colonized than the ovary, a phenotype that is likely favored by the ability of SE to attach to vaginal mucosa (Miyamoto et al., 1997, Okamura et al., 2001). In contrast, intravenous infection was reported to result in more prolific colonization of the ovary and the entire oviduct (infundibulum, magnum, and isthmus), yielding more frequent recovery of SE from egg contents and developing eggs when compared with the intravaginal, intracloacal, or oral routes (Bichler et al., 1996, Kinde et al., 2000, Miyamoto et al., 1997, Petter, 1993). In addition to vaginal epithelium, SE also attaches to glandular secretions and tubular glands of isthmus in cultured primary chicken oviduct epithelial cells (COECs), pointing to the isthmus as a colonization site (De Buck et al., 2004a). In summary, it is important to note that most published studies have reported RT organ colonization in terms of either number of SE-positive tissues or number of SE-positive eggs without really establishing bacterial burden (i.e., CFU per gram) as a baseline for comparison. Several variables such as SE strain type, phage type, inoculation route, dose, breed, and age of hens represent a significant challenge for drawing meaningful interpretations from the body of published literature. Therefore there is no clear consensus regarding which parts of RT organs may contribute more significantly to egg contamination; however, the entire RT appears to be colonized by SE. The aforementioned factors (route, dose, strain type, and age of chicken) may as well significantly influence the ability of SE to colonize the avian RT. Thus it is imperative that these factors are carefully considered before designing studies to investigate RT organ infection in chickens.",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that the primary route of egg contamination is via deposition of SE from the infected RT directly into the internal contents of eggs prior to oviposition (Arnold et al., 2014, Gast and Holt, 2000, Keller et al., 1995, Shivaprasad et al., 1990). It is also known that the hen egg presents a hostile environment for efficient propagation of SE. First, the outer shell membrane and shell membrane not only act as physical barriers, but also contain chemical compounds with antibacterial properties including lysozyme (Hincke et al., 2000), ovotransferrin (Gautron et al., 2001), ovocalyxin-36 (Gautron et al., 2007), and an unknown protein extract (Gantois et al., 2009a). In addition, egg albumen, vitelline membranes, and yolk contain antimicrobial compounds such as lysozyme, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, ovomucin, \u03b2-defensin 11, and immunoglobulins (Gantois et al., 2009a, Mageed et al., 2008, Mann, 2007, Stevens, 1991). Despite the presence of these physical and chemical barriers, certain strains of SE are efficiently able to penetrate, survive, and propagate within different egg contents. The eggshell and eggshell membrane penetration is not unique to SE because other Salmonella serotypes and bacterial species can also penetrate these barriers (De Reu et al., 2006). In one study, no significant differences in egg-shell penetration were found between SE and S. Typhimurium (Miyamoto et al., 1998). Others have compared the growth of different Salmonella serovars by artificially contaminating egg albumen and have reported no differences between SE (n\n = 8) and S. Typhimurium (n\n = 24) at 37\u00b0C or 42\u00b0C (Guan et al., 2006). Similarly, Messens et al. (2004) did not observe any growth advantage for SE in egg albumen when compared with other non-SE serovars including S. Typhimurium, Senftenberg, Stanleyville, Mbandaka, and Blockley. Interestingly, however, it was reported that Salmonella generally grew better in egg albumen harvested from fresh eggs than from stored eggs, presumably due to the highly alkaline environment (pH approximately 9.0) associated with storage (Messens et al., 2004). One study reported that the survival of SE (25.8%) was higher than that of Typhimurium (6.5%) or E. coli (1.8%) in egg albumen extracted from fresh eggs and incubated at room temperature (Clavijo et al., 2006). De Vylder et al. (2013) evaluated the survivability of 89 strains of Salmonella belonging to five different serogroups (B, C, D, E, and G) and 26 serotypes within fresh egg albumen incubated at 42\u00b0C. These authors reported that SE isolates generally displayed greater survivability within egg albumen compared with other serogroups, suggesting that both the age of egg albumen and temperature of incubation may have significant impact on the survival of SE in this system. More importantly, published data also show that there is wide interstrain variability in survival/growth of SE within egg albumen, suggesting that individual variation between strains is also an important factor (Clavijo et al., 2006, Shah et al., 2012a, Yim et al., 2010). Finally, it is known that SE can traverse through vitelline membrane into the egg yolk and replicate efficiently. However, this property is not unique to SE because several other serotypes including S. Montevideo, S. Infantis, S. Heidelberg, S. Typhimurium, S. Virchow, and S. Hadar have been reported to display a similar phenotype (Gantois et al., 2008b, Gast et al., 2007a, Murase et al., 2006). Unlike in egg albumen, strains of SE belonging to different phage types (4, 8, 13a, and 14b) grow equally well in egg yolks, presumably because yolk is enriched with different nutrients that can be utilized by bacteria for efficient growth and multiplication (Gast and Holt, 2001). In summary, it appears that SE may have the specialized ability to grow or survive within egg albumen; however, this trait is significantly influenced by the strain type of SE, age of egg albumen, and temperature of incubation. Therefore it is important to carefully consider these factors while designing studies that investigate genetic factors that contribute to the survivability of SE in egg albumen.",

Much of this phenotype variation is not explained at the genotypic level (Shah, 2014, Shah et al., 2011, Yim et al., 2010). In one study, the genomes of different SE isolates were reported to display thousands of SNP differences and greater than 300 variable genes (Allard et al., 2013). In this study, 21 genes from genetic lineages representing outbreak-associated isolates showed nonsynonymous mutations and this affected least five putatively virulence-associated genes. The pseudogene content among different SE strains is also known to vary (genes ratB, a known virulence gene, and mviM are examples) (Matthews et al., 2015). Virtually no studies to date have explored the basis of this inter-strain genetic variation and its association with differential virulence of SE. It is imperative that more efforts be made to compare multiple SE strains in molecular pathogenesis studies before researchers arrive at broad conclusions about this serotype. Rapid screening of thousands or more Salmonella mutants by negative selection is now possible by combining random transposon mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing using transposon directed insertion sequencing (TraDIS) or TnSeq. This technology may allow simultaneous examination of multiple SE strains to identify pathogenicity factors in both young and adult chickens.",

            "text": "Although several studies have focused on identifying and characterizing the role of SE genetic factors in colonization of avian RT, follow-up studies to conclusively demonstrate their role are often lacking. Both in vitro cell culture models and in vivo avian infection models have been utilized to identify and characterize genetic factors that contribute to RT infection in chickens. However, the outcome of different studies is not always comparable. For instance, COEC can be a useful in vitro model for high-throughput screening of mutants to identify genes and their possible role in avian RT infection, as well as to study physiological and immunological responses of RT. Nonetheless, critical aspects regarding the source and treatment of COEC vary among studies: primary cultures have been obtained from birds at different ages under different hormonal treatment schemes. In two separate studies, COEC derived from 7-week-old chicks repeatedly treated with estradiol resulted in successful intracellular replication of SE for up to 24 h postinfection (De Buck et al., 2004a, De Buck et al., 2004b), whereas COEC derived from 25- to 28-week-old mature hens resulted in failure to establish such intracellular replication (Li et al., 2009). The age, sexual maturation, and differential expression of immune mediators are suspected as potential underlying factors (Anastasiadou et al., 2013, Ebers et al., 2009, Withanage et al., 2003). This may also partially explain the differential susceptibility of ovarian follicles at different maturation stages (Wang et al., 2014). Thus, it is imperative to establish a standardized in vitro cell culture system to study interaction between SE and the avian RT, which may also serve as a model to study other relevant avian pathogens (e.g., avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus) with RT tissue tropism (Mork et al., 2014). In vivo studies also differ in several critical aspects that include age, breed, infection dose, route, and bacterial strain. Result outputs are sometimes reported as frequency of SE-positive organs or as bacterial burden (CFU per gram), complicating comparison among different studies. Development and validation of the laying hen model to study the role of different genetic factors in RT infection and contamination of internal content of eggs may help overcome some of the current challenges. In addition to identifying SE factors required for establishing infection in chickens, research is also needed to delineate the host factors. For instance, deciphering the metabolic requirements of SE in the chicken RT may provide some clues to factors that drive predilection of this bacterium to this organ system. In addition, how does SE interact with the chicken microbiota? what factors influence this interaction? and how does this interaction influence outcome of infection? These are some of the key questions that require additional research efforts (Ricke, 2003).",

            "text": "Because the entire hen RT can be colonized by SE, contamination of internal contents of eggs could result regardless of which specific anatomic site is more heavily colonized. Consequently, there is considerable interest in understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying the ability of this serotype to colonize and survive within the internal contents of eggs, more specifically egg albumen. Early work in this field showed that nonmotile mutants of SE (\u0394fliC and \u0394motAB) as well as other nonmotile serovars including S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum are impaired in their ability to propagate in egg albumen (Cogan et al., 2004). Moreover, work conducted in our laboratory revealed that wild-type strains of SE with impaired motility are also impaired in their survival within egg albumen when incubated at 25\u00b0C (Shah et al., 2012a). In addition, we reported that disruption of fliH and fljB in SE conferred motility impairment and these mutants were also impaired in their growth in egg albumen (Shah et al., 2012b). These reports collectively suggest that motility is associated with the ability of SE to survive and propagate within egg albumen. It is also speculated that flagella could be an important factor for moving Salmonella through albumen and toward the yolk (Baron et al., 1997). In addition to motility, curli fimbriae production appears to be important for invasion and survival within egg contents. One study showed that inactivation of agfA (encoding curli production) invaded yolk less frequently suggesting the importance of the role of curli in survival and persistence within the egg (Cogan et al., 2004). In addition, genes involved in DNA replication and repair have been identified in multiple studies. In one study, disruption of yafD (a member of exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase family) was reported to significantly impact the growth of SE and S. Typhimurium within egg albumen (Lu et al., 2003). These authors suggested that absence of yafD may affect the ability of bacteria to repair DNA damage and thereby provide a fitness disadvantage to SE in egg albumen. Subsequently, Clavijo et al. (2006) screened a library of 2850 transposon mutants of SE and identified a total of 32 SE mutants that showed defective survivability (\u226410%) when grown in egg albumen at 37\u00b0C. These genes were broadly categorized into genes associated with cell-wall structure and functional integrity, nucleic acid and amino acid metabolism in SE; however, yafD gene reported earlier was not identified in this study. Interestingly, one SE-specific gene (SEN4287) putatively associated with restriction endonuclease system was identified by Clavijo et al. (2006). When SEN4287 was expressed in trans in S. Typhimurium, it conferred survival advantage in egg albumen when compared with the isogenic wild-type S. Typhimurium; however, the survivability was not as high as the wild-type SE strain (Clavijo et al., 2006). These authors suggested that SEN4287 may have an important role in providing fitness advantage to SE in egg albumen; however, factors other than SEN4278 may also be required for survival in this hostile environment. We reported that disruption in genes involved in DNA recombination, replication, and repair (SEN1152, SEN1393, and SEN1966) and translation (ksgA) resulted in reduced growth in egg albumen (Shah et al., 2012b). LPS also appears to contribute to the survival of SE in egg albumen. In one study, expression of rfbH, an LPS biosynthesis gene, was highly upregulated during SE growth in egg albumen at room temperature (Gantois et al., 2009b). Moreover, disruption of rfbH resulted in impaired growth in egg albumen at both 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C. Additionally, we reported that disruption of rfbN, encoding LPS biosynthesis, resulted in reduced growth in egg albumen (Shah et al., 2012b). It is important to note that several strains of SE contain HMM-LPS, which is associated with egg contamination (Guard-Petter et al., 1999). It is possible that HMM-LPS may interfere with binding of different antimicrobial compounds including lysozyme and ovotransferrin of egg albumen with SE. Thus more research is needed to understand the specific role of the LPS in resistance to the antimicrobial compounds of egg albumen and its association with egg contamination. Collectively, the published body of literature suggests that SE likely undergoes significant metabolic adjustments in egg albumen and that certain strains of SE are likely to be more genetically fit to propagate in egg albumen. One report shows that passage of SE in the egg yolk confers a higher rate of intestinal colonization and extraintestinal organ invasion in orally inoculated mice when compared with SE passaged in laboratory media or in mouse (Moreau et al., 2016). This raises the possibility that propagation of SE within egg contents can significantly increase the pathogenicity of SE in the host; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In conclusion, multiple mechanisms may be at play to regulate bacterial physiology in the egg environment and eventually aid in contamination and survival or propagation of SE within eggs. However, based on the current literature, it has been difficult to pinpoint these mechanisms unequivocally and establish cogent pathways or genetic factors. Consequently, factors or mechanisms that enable SE to colonize and survive within eggs still remain an important knowledge gap. Further research is needed to determine the genetic factors that contribute to the interaction of SE with egg contents and their impact on gene expression and virulence of SE.",
