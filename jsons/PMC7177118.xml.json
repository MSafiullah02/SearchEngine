As the accepted definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in GDP (BBC News, 2008), it\u2019s not entirely clear, as I write, whether that test will be met in the coming months. But one fact is clear, a fact amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic that\u2019s now upon us with a vengeance: Another recession will arrive someday\u2014mostly likely sooner, perhaps later. It is probably\u2014almost undeniably\u2014already here.",

In fact, it\u2019s the norm. What they need, I have found, to better manage their companies\u2019 performance and fund their growth when times are good, and to survive when times suddenly get tough, is a set of tools that can help them answer four crucial questions:1.Where is cash going in my business, and where is it coming from?2.To what extent are my profit margins improving or declining, and why?3.To what extent am I effectively managing the cash-flow relationships with my customers and my suppliers?4.What, if anything, can I do to better manage the cash that flows into and out of my business?\n",

Crucially, we want to know whether Acme was relatively more efficient, or less so, in managing its costs (e.g., cost of goods sold, operating expenses) and the resulting gross margins and profit margins that were delivered. Such efficiency is only meaningful, however, when compared to something else. To what might we compare?\u2022Acme\u2019s history is one useful comparison. Is Acme getting better at managing, say, cost of goods sold, or worse? Is it achieving any economies of scale with regard to operating expenses as it grows?\u2022Comparing Acme to others in its industry is also instructive (Higson, 2012). Is Acme more efficient than others in some expense categories? Less so in others? One source of such information for American companies is the Risk Management Association\u2019s Annual Statement Studies (Risk Management Association, 2020). Industry trade magazines are another.\n",

Try raising prices on these items alone.\u2022In a recession, your suppliers are likely to be worried about falling demand and slow-paying customers. Ask for price concessions in return for agreeing to pay on time, or if your cash permits, in advance. Even better, offer your key suppliers long-term contracts for delivery when sales turn up, even paid in advance if your cash position permits (Tully, 2020). A recession is a good time to cut great deals!\n",

It\u2019s the first thing a company can stop spending money on\u201d (Mullins, 2014, p. 7). In early 2008, his company, Ryzex, found itself with falling revenues (down 25%), declining profit margins (margin dollars down 50%), and $3 million in debt.
