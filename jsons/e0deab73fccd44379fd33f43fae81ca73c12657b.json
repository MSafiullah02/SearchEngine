A person infected with SARS-CoV-2, following an incubation period, will become either sick (with COVID-19) or will be asymptomatic; the latter will recover, whereas a sick person will either recover or will be hospitalized where they will either die or recover. We assume that the interaction between a person who is infected and a person with the capacity to be infected is described by the usual mechanism of the standard epidemiological models. We first show that by choosing appropriately the parameters of the mathematical equations describing the dynamics of the above sub-populations in data stemming from Greece, one can obtain a reasonable match of the existing data for the time evolution of the total number of deaths and infections for both subpopulations during the current state of lockdown. Then, we consider two possible alternatives: first, we keep the two parameters describing the interactions of older-older and older-young as they are now, but we increase the value of the parameter describing the interaction of youngyoung; this means that we allow the lockdown measures to be eased only in the young sub-population. Second, we increase the values of all the three above parameters, which means we ease the lockdown measures in both sub-populations. In the first case, the number of deaths remains relatively small, whereas in the second case the situation, upon sufficient increase of the number of contacts, may become catastrophic potentially leading to a dramatic loss of lives.",

Fortunately, it has lower mortality rates than these two viruses which caused outbreaks in 2012 and 2002 [2] . However, SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. Perhaps the increased transmissivity of SARS-CoV-2 is due to its dual receptor attachment in the host cells: it has been shown that the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the surface of respiratory cells is mediated by certain viral proteins which bind not only to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor [3] , but also bind to sialic acid containing glycoproteins and gangliosides that reside on cell surfaces [4] ; this is to be contrasted with SARS-CoV that binds only to ACE-2 receptors [3] [4] [5] . As a result of this high transmissivity, as well as of the delay of the international community to take appropriate preventive measures, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic, which represents the most serious global public health threat since the devastating 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic that killed approximately 50 million people (in proportion to today's population, this would correspond to about 200 million people).",

As a result of these measures, the number of the total persons infected by SARS-CoV-2, in China, South Korea, many European countries, USA, and several other countries, has now passed the inflection point, namely the point where the rate of infected individuals reaches its maximum. For the above countries, the curve depicting the number of deaths as a function of time is also past the inflection point. Predictions for the time that a plateau will be attained (defined as the time when the rate of deaths is 5% of the maximum rate) as well as the corresponding number of total deaths at that time, have been presented, e.g., in [6] (similar results regarding reported infections are presented in [7] ). In addition to these works, it should be noted that there is a wide effort under way to use epidemiological models stemming from different (deterministic, as well as probabilistic) variations of the broad SIR class of models to capture different countries [8] [9] [10] [11] , and states or provinces [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .

Naturally, the best possible scenario would be the discovery of a safe and effective vaccine; however, it appears that this will not be achieved for at least one year. The second optimal solution would be the discovery of effective pharmacological interventions. In this direction unprecedented efforts are underway, including the use of old or new medications as well as the employment of specific monoclonal antibodies. For example, there are ongoing clinical trials testing the synthetic protein tocilizumab that binds inerleukin-6 (often used in rheumatoid arthritis), as well as the infusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma [18] 1 . Also, taking into consideration that the complement pathway is an integral component of the innate immune response to viruses, and that complement deposits are abundant in the lung biopsies from COVID-19 patients indicating that this system is overacting [21] , it has been suggested that anti-complement therapies may be beneficial to COVID-19 patients 2 . The Federal Drug Administration of USA has granted a conditional approval to the anti-viral medication Remdesivir [22] .

In the second case, the lockdown measures are substantially eased for all interactions without distinguishing the older from the young. Under the assumption of the validity of our mathematical model, we will show that these two alternatives have very different outcomes: in the first case, the total number of deaths of the two sub-populations and the number of total infections is relatively small; in the second case, these numbers are prohibitively high.",

These numbers remain essentially the same even if the lockdown measures for the interaction between the young people are eased substantially, provided that the interactions of older-older and older-young observe the current lockdown conditions. For example, even if the parameter measuring the effect of the lockdown restrictions on the young-young interactions is increased fourfold, the number of deaths and infections are (according to the model extrapolation) 184 and 3585, respectively. On the other hand, even if the parameters characterizing all three interactions are increased only threefold, the relevant numbers are 48144 and 1283462.

It is noted that our model is inspired by various expanded versions of the classic SIR model adapted to the particularities of COVID-19 (such as the key role of the asymptomatically infected). It is, in particular, inspired by, yet not identical with that of [14] . In order to complete the system of equations (1)-(6), it is necessary to describe the mechanism via which a person can become infected. For this purpose we adopt the standard assumptions made in the typical epidemiological models, such as the SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model: let T denote the total population and let c characterize the number of contacts per day made by an individual with the capacity to infect (c is thought of as being normalized by T ). Such a person belongs to S, A or H. However, for simplicity we assume that the hospitalized population cannot infect; this assumption is based on two considerations: first, the strict protective measures taken at the hospital, and second, the fact that hospitalized patients are infectious only for part of their stay in the hospital. The latter fact is a consequence of the relevant time scales of virus shedding in comparison to the time to hospitalization and the duration of hospital stay. The asymptomatic individuals are (more) free to interact with others, whereas the (self-isolating) sick persons are not. Thus, we use c to characterize the contacts of the asymptomatic persons and b to indicate the different infectiousness (due to reduced contacts/self-isolation) of the sick in comparison to the asymptomatic individuals.",

Naturally, for the two-age model considered below, there is one set of such parameters associated with the young population and one associated with the older one. The optimization routine used for the identification of these parameters is explained in detail in Appendix II. The parameters resulting from this optimization for each of the two populations are given in Table III at the end of Appendix II. Clearly, many of these parameters are larger for the older population in comparison to the young, leading to a larger number of both infections and deaths in the older than in the young populations. Support for the validity of our model is presented in Fig. 2 , which depicts its comparison (using the above optimized parameters) with the available data. Our model slightly under-predicts the total infections; this can be improved by using a variant of the model, where the parameters c and b take different values in the two subpopulations. However, since the introduction of additional parameters significantly complicates the model further, we concentrate on the simpler model. We discuss the case of different parameters for different populations, to which we refer to as the \"anisotropic\" variant of the model, further in the Appendix I. The situation corresponding to the unrealistic assumption that the lockdown conditions presently in place continue indefinitely, is the one illustrated in Fig. 2 . In this case, the number of deaths and cumulative infections rapidly reaches a plateau, indicating the elimination of the infection.

The relevant results are illustrated in Figs. 3-5 and the essential conclusions are summarized in Tables I-II for the numbers of deaths and cumulative infections, respectively. First, we need to explain the meaning of the parameter \u03b6 appearing in the above tables: this parameter reflects the magnitude of the easing of the lock down restrictions. Indeed, since the main effect of the lessening of these restrictions is that the number of contacts increases, we model the effect of easing the lockdown restrictions by multiplying the parameter c with a factor that we refer to as \u03b6. The complete lockdown situation corresponds to \u03b6=1; the larger the value of \u03b6, the lesser the restrictions imposed on the population. By employing the above quantitative measure of easing the lockdown restrictions, we consider in detail two distinct scenarios. In the first, which corresponds to the top rows of the Figures 3-5 , we only allow the number of contacts of \"young individuals with young individuals\" (corresponding to the parameter c yy mentioned in the Appendix I) to be multiplied by the factor \u03b6. This means that the lockdown measures are eased only with respect to the interaction of young individuals with other young individuals, while the interactions of the young individuals with the older ones, as well as the interactions among older individuals remain in the lockdown state. In the second scenario, corresponding to the top rows of the Figures 3-5 , the restrictions of the lockdown are simultaneously eased in both the young and the older population; in this case all contacts are increased by the factor \u03b6. It is noted that while we change c by this factor, we maintain the product cb at its previous value, considering that the sick still operate under self-isolation conditions and thus do not accordingly increase their number of contacts. Tables I-II , the situation does not worsen in a dramatic way. In particular, the number of deaths increases by 1, whereas the cumulative infections only increase by the small number of 58.

Here, even the effect of releasing the young population leads to very substantial increases, namely to 6044 deaths and 306219 infections although of course it is nowhere near to the scenarios of releasing both young and older populations.

The fact that \u03b6 = 2 gives rise to a stable situation is consistent with the following considerations: mathematically, the notion of stability is usually formulated in terms of the concept of the so-called \"dominant eigenvalue\". For our case, by computing this eigenvalue for the healthy state (where no individuals are at any stage of sickness, symptomatic or asymptomatic), we find that the transition between stability and instability occurs if the dominant eigenvalue vanishes and this corresponds to c=0.1688. In epidemiological language, this corresponds to the scenario of R 0 = 1. This value of c equals 2.0923 times the value of c corresponding to the lockdown conditions. Thus, the transition from stability to instability occurs between doubling and tripling of all contacts. Indeed, in this case, the analysis of the model provides a warning of a possible disaster: if the number of contacts of the older population increases threefold, either among themselves or with the young population, the increase of deaths and of the number of infected persons is dramatic.

Moreover, we have seen that even increasing that number of contacts by a factor of 4 does not have catastrophic consequences. More dire is the situation when the relevant factor is 5 but even then it leads to a far less significant effect than, e.g., allowing both the young and the older population to triple their contacts 5 . An important potential weakness of our results lies in the possible discrepancy between the function C(t) of the total number of (truly) 'infected' individuals calculated in our model, and the number of 'reported infected' provided in the Greek data. Since the latter number is likely to be smaller than the actual number of infected individuals we have repeated the above considerations using a \"virtual time series\" formed by magnifying the actual data by a factor, e.g., of 2; it is encouraging for the validity of our conclusions that in this case there was qualitative agreement with the trends discussed above obtained using the available data.

A key such factor can be the heat and humidity especially in the northern hemisphere which holds dramatically the lion's share in terms of COVID-19 infections and deaths 6 . Nevertheless, the standing formulation and interpretation of c within SIR models [26] as the number of contacts per unit time (and in our case, per population unit) suggests that policy makers should strongly recommend that people above 40 years of age continue to observe all above measures as strictly as it was done during the full lockdown period.

Actually, taking into consideration that the numbers of deaths and of infected individuals are quite low in Greece in comparison with other countries, it follows that the need for considering the above recommendations is even more crucial in these countries. At the same time, the availability of data that would allow the broader applicability of this type of modeling would be of paramount importance in evaluating the course of the pandemic (the corresponding critical value of c etc.) in different locations and under different population distributions, climate/weather conditions etc. Here, we have focused on the example of Greece where very low numbers of infections and deaths have been recorded, but we would argue that a similar type of analysis can be developed and is worthwhile to examine in other regions/countries. Indeed, we have used the data available for the case of Portugal, another country with a relatively low number of cases [27] . A similar analysis there yields a significantly larger c in comparison to Greece, which is reasonable to expect given that Portugal has a similar population to Greece, yet has about 7 times as many deaths resulting from COVID-19. Nevertheless, our computations indicate that doubling the value of c (i.e., \u03b6 = 2) would be a stable (non-catastrophic) situation for Portugal also, if the lockdown measures were eased for the young population. However, the considerably larger value of transmissivity obtained in the best fit for Portugal (in comparison to Greece) would lead to a catastrophic scenario if the lockdown measures were released for the full population. This highlights the potentially broader applicability of the present proposal. The methodology presented here could (and perhaps should) be applied to other countries; the results will depend crucially on the corresponding data obtained during the lockdown conditions.",

A more detailed analysis should examine the number of patients admitted in the intensive care unit, as well as several other consequences of a COVID-19 infection (including, ideally, age-resolved time series for the evolution of hospitalizations and recovered individuals). For example, it is well known that many viral infections can cause a variety of post-viral illnesses, including many neurological conditions, such as the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndromes (which comprise a spectrum of polyneuropathies 7 ) . The possibility of these devastating conditions implies that the recommendations suggested in this work may also bear a broader impact, in connection to such effects.",

            "text": "With these equations we have a full dynamical system for the young and older populations. Implicit, however, within this dynamical system is the following modeling assumption: in Eqs. (7)-(8), we have assumed a single prefactor c and a single coefficient b. This assumes that young infectious agents (A y + bS y ) interact with a young susceptible person (first bracket in Eq. (7)) in exactly the same way that older infectious agents (A o + bS o ) interact with a young susceptible person. Since it is not clear that this is indeed the case, in a generalized form of the model, one could assume a factor c yy (A y + b yy S y ) for the contact interaction of a young with a young and similarly a different factor c yo (A o + b yo S o ) for the interaction of an older infectious individual (given by this expression) with a young susceptible one. Similarly in this setting, Eq. (8) would include a different mode of interaction between young infectious agents and older susceptibles (proportional to c oy (A y + b oy S y )), and between older infectious agents and older susceptibles (proportional to c oo (A o + b oo S o )). We have analyzed this generalized model, which we have called anisotropic. Actually, we obtained slightly better fits for the numbers of infections and deaths using this model. Nevertheless, we opted against showing the results of the latter computations regarding the effect of varying \u03b6. The reason for this decision is that several more parameters are needed for the specification of the anisotropic model; these parameters characterize the yy , yo , oy and oo interactions (i.e., 4 pairs of (b, c) parameters instead of 1). This enlarges significantly the space of possible fitting parameters; actually, in this case we have observed the existence of multiple possible local minima (although distinct, these minima yield similarly adequate fitting results). A mathematical formulation of this issue is associated with the notion of identifiability of parameters in such SIR type models [29] . Hence, despite the potential slight improvement of the anisotropic model towards capturing the available data, we feel that the simpler model still provides a reasonably accurate picture of the impact of the different easing of lockdown strategies.",

In this connection we distinguish between the individuals who recovered from the asymptomatic state R A , and those that eventually recovered stemming from the sick population, R S ; the total number of recovered individuals is R = R A + R S . The cumulative number of reported infected persons is given by C(t) = S(t) + H(t) + R S (t)+D(t). It is this number of cumulative infections computed from the model that we compare to the corresponding number in the official data. The variable without subscript corresponds to the result obtained from integrating the model equations whereas the subscript data refers to the observed data; both variables are tracked at times t i (that is, every day). The relevant data were obtained from [30] . It is worth highlighting that unfortunately we were not able to obtain relevant data in a ready-to-use format for research purposes (despite our formal request), such as in the form of a spreadsheet. Thus, we had to assemble the relevant data point-by-point from the corresponding daily reports. Hopefully, this will be amended in the near future and will accordingly facilitate relevant future research. Moreover, as indicated above, a potential further partition of ages may be beneficial in its own right. Indeed, in the data such a partition does exist between individuals of 0 \u2212 17 years, 18 \u2212 39 years, 40 \u2212 64 years and over 65 years. This renders the relevant data ripe for a consideration towards a 4-age model in the near future 8 .",
