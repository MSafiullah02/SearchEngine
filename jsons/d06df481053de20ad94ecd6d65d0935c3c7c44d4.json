            "text": "The global distribution of these coastal systems is controlled mostly by relative sea-level changes, particularly eustatic sea-level changes and glacio-and hydro-isostasy. After the last glacial maximum (LGM), about 20,000 years ago, eustatic sea level (global sea-level changes) rose until 4,000 years ago, and since then the sea level has been comparatively stable. However, a relative (observed) sea-level change is locally determined by the combination of these eustatic sea-level changes, isostatic effects of glaciers (glacio-isostasy) and meltwater (hydro-isostasy), and local factors (e.g., tectonics, humancaused subsidence etc.). Glacio-isostasy and hydro-isostasy have strongly impacted Holocene sea-level changes on a global scale. In glacio-isostasy, areas surrounding regions glaciated during the LGM that bulged because of glacial loading, have since subsided; therefore, in such areas, the relative sea level has risen on a millennial timescale. Thus the mid to southern parts of North America, mid to southern Europe, and the Mediterranean region have experienced a rising sea level through the Holocene as a result of glacioisostasy. The relative sea level has risen in these regions at a rate of ca.1 m/ky for the last 7,000 years; therefore, transgressive systems are found in these areas. On the other hand, most of Asia, Oceania, central to southern Africa, and South America were far from glaciers during the LGM. Hence, although FIG. 3.1.1. Coastal depositional systems. (After Boyd et al., 1992.) direct influence from glaciers is less significant, the isostatic effects of meltwater loads (the increased loading of seawater on the mantle) have also led to Holocene sea-level changes in these regions. As a result of movement of the mantle from beneath the ocean floor to under continental areas, land areas have uplifted on a millennial timescale, resulting in a relative sea-level fall of 2-3 m during the last 6,000-7,000 years. Therefore, regressive coastal systems are well developed in these areas. Most lagoons and estuaries that formed in these regions during the early Holocene have been filled or abandoned during the subsequent sea-level fall.",

Although the general distribution of coastal systems is controlled by relative sea-level changes, the amount of sediment supply also influences shoreline migration. Even when the relative sea level is rising, the shoreline may migrate seaward if the sediment supply is high. The Mississippi and Nile deltas, both located where sea level rose through the Holocene, are good examples of regressive coastal systems developed during a sea-level rise. Conversely, along Australian coasts, estuaries are well developed even though the relative sea level has fallen over the last 6,000 years. The estuaries and lagoons that formed during the early Holocene have persisted, remaining unfilled because of the very low sediment supply from that dry and ancient continent (Saito 2001 (Saito , 2005b . Figure 3 .1.2 summarizes the relationship between sediment supply and relative sea-level change with regard to shoreline migration. Barriers and estuaries are typical coastal features when the shoreline is migrating landward. A rise in sea level causes marine inundation of the incised valleys that formed during the sea-level lowstand, resulting in the formation of drowned valleys and estuaries. The sand composing the barriers is supplied mostly from coastal erosion at headlands and by recycling marine sand, because river mouths are in retreat during transgressive periods. As a result the distribution of riverine sand is generally limited to within the estuarine head.

During storms, except for washover sediments deposited on the land, most sediments are moved seaward by offshore bottom currents. These, in combination with gravitational sediment movement in the nearshore zone (shoreface or delta front slope), result in an erosional environment.

The upper shoreface, also called the inshore, is characterized by bar and trough topography as a result of being constantly influenced by waves and wave-induced currents.

They often move landward during fair weather, carried by breakers. The positions of the outermost longshore bars are relatively stable. These bars are thought to be formed during storm waves. Sediments in the upper shoreface are relatively coarse grained, forming dunes and 2D and 3D ripples. Thus active morphological change and sediment movement are typical on the upper shoreface. However, they are not typical on the lower shoreface under fair-weather conditions. Small ripples are often found, but alongshore sediment movement is not active in the lower shoreface. Most sediments are storm generated (HCS/SCS). These differences between the upper and lower shoreface result in a clear erosional boundary and time gap. The water depth of this boundary ranges from 4 to 8 m, depending on wave conditions. Under fair-weather conditions sediment movement and its budget form a closed system in the upper shoreface. The closure depth is located at the boundary between the upper and lower shoreface. However, during storms, when some foreshore and upper shoreface sediments are transported offshore, the closure depth is deepened. Therefore, the sediment budget of the upper shoreface in a shore-normal section is fixed during fair weather, and negative during storms because of sediment loss due to offshore transport. If the sediment supply to the upper shoreface is not enough to compensate for the sediment loss by alongshore sediment movement, coastal erosion will occur along such a coast. As alongshore sediment transport for sands and gravels occurs only in the upper shoreface zone, it is important that coastal structures such as groins and jetties do not cross the whole of the upper shoreface zone and cut off alongshore sediment movement. If the depth and length of such structures are such that the upper shoreface is blocked, sediments will not be transported downcurrent beyond the structures, resulting in coastal erosion in downcurrent areas. Most human-caused coastal erosion is the result of cessation of alongshore sediment transport.",

There are three major sediment sources for coastal sediments: rivers, sediment supplied by coastal erosion from coastal cliffs or headlands, and recycled marine sediment. Most sands and gravels supplied by rivers are deposited in the river-mouth area, except for hyperpycnal flows. Sands deposited in the upper shoreface or delta front platform are removed by waves and transported alongshore by longshore currents, forming bars and foreshore deposits, or offshore by storm waves and offshore-directed bottom currents. Sands supplied from sea cliffs and headlands are also transported alongshore. These point-source sands are transported alongshore and accreted onto the foreshore (beaches), resulting in shoreline migration seaward. However, intense storms pick up these sediments and transport them offshore. Thus, these coastal sediments are regarded as a line source of offshore sediments. Sediment recycling is very important on both wave-dominated and low-energy coasts. Barriers in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and in the Wadden Sea of the North Sea are composed of recycled sands. Some barriers are maintained during transgression by the recycling of both overwash sediments and sediments of retreating barriers. However, at present, some beaches on barriers in the Wadden Sea are maintained by beach nourishment. Mud sediment sources are also from rivers and coastal erosion.

A decrease in the sediment discharge of rivers due to dam construction, irrigation, or sand mining in channels and river banks is also a cause of coastal erosion. An increase in water depth in nearshore zones induces an increase in wave energy, resulting in increased sediment transport offshore.

Very wide, flat morphology that is well developed in the intertidal to subtidal zones is called a tidal flat. Bars and trough topography are also found in these zones. Two directional currents, the flood current and the ebb current, give the sediment transport a characteristic pattern. The capacity for sediment transport of flood and ebb currents is controlled by current velocity and duration. In general, sediment transport by flood currents exceeds that of ebb currents, resulting in a prevailing landward sediment transport. This phenomenon is called the tidal pump. Moreover, current velocity increases with water depth, resulting in more energetic conditions offshore. Therefore, sediment deposits on a tidedominated coast show a landward fining (seaward coarsening) distribution ( Fig. 3.1.4) . Typically, sandy sediments in subtidal zones change to muddier sediments in the intertidal zone and in the vegetated supratidal zone. From the upper part of the intertidal zone to the supratidal zone salt marshes are well developed, particularly in coastal lagoons and estuaries. In tropical to subtropical regions, mangroves are found between the mean tide level and the high tide level.

On a wave-and storm-dominated coast, the shoreface topography is thought to represent an equilibrium profile controlled by waves and sediments (sea level 1 in Fig. 3 .1.5). When sea level rises, a new equilibrium profile is formed. As the sediment supply is generally not enough to fill all the accommodation space to maintain the shoreline position, the shoreline retreats and a new profile forms at the new shoreline position (sea Fig. 3.1.5) . Some of the shoreface sediments are eroded in the process of forming the new equilibrium profile. This phenomenon is called shoreface erosion according to the Bruun principle or rule. It is important to note that erosion occurs not only at the shoreline but also in the shoreface region, at water depths of less than about 15 m. The sea-level rise leads to an increase of wave power caused by the increase in water depth. Coastal erosion of cliffs and strand plains will also be accelerated by a sea-level rise. Mimura and Kawaguchi (1996) estimated that sand beach erosion will occur at all Japanese beaches when sea level rises. Their results show a 60% loss of beaches with a 30-cm sea-level rise, an 80% loss with a 65-cm rise, and a 90% loss with a 100-cm rise. Although a sea-level rise would also increase the sediment supply to beaches as a result of cliff erosion, that was not considered in this estimate. Because most cliffs in the Japanese islands that used to supply sediments to beaches are now protected from wave action by concrete blocks, this additional supply is no longer overly large.",

Subsidence due to groundwater pumping has occurred not only in Bangkok but also in the coastal zone south of the city. The mouth of the Chao Phraya River is located south of these areas. At the river mouth, and in the neighboring coastal zones, more than 60 cm of subsidence occurred during the 1960s to 1980s, resulting in severe coastal erosion (Vongvisessomjai 1992; Vongvisessomjai et al., 1996) . The shoreline retreat was 700 m in total up to the early 1990s. The main causes of this erosion and retreat are submergence and an increase of wave energy as a result of the nearshore zone being deepened by subsidence. As the nearshore zone has a very gentle slope of 1/1000, the more than 60 cm of subsidence (deepening) directly caused an increase in wave energy. Moreover, destruction of mangroves in conjunction with shrimp pond farming has enhanced FIG. 3.1.5. Shoreface erosion due to a sea-level rise. (After Bruun 1962; Saito 1989.) shoreline retreat. Once frontal mangroves were destroyed, the shoreline retreated past the shrimp ponds to the next mangrove forest. Recently, coastal erosion continues to propagate along the coast, in addition to the river mouth, in response to widespread subsidence, with approximately 20 cm of subsidence occurring between 1992-2000. The reduced sediment supply from the Chao Phraya River caused by dam construction has also affected the coastal zone and its ecosystems (Winterwerp et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Asian coasts are characterized by large river deltas: for example, the Indus, Narmada, Godavari, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy), Chao Phraya, Mekong, Song Hong (Red River), Zhujiang (Pearl River), Changjiang (Yangtze River), and Huanghe (Yellow River) deltas. Nine of the world's 16 largest rivers (in terms of sediment discharge) are located in Asia -10 if the Fly River in Papua New Guinea is included. Rivers in Asia and Oceania contribute about 70% of the world's sediment flux from the land to the ocean: large rivers in Asia contribute about 40%, and small rivers in mountainous Oceania contribute 30% of the world's flux. This huge sediment supply causes the formation of large river deltas with a high progradation rate. During the last 2,000 years, the shoreline has migrated seaward about 80 km at the mouth of the Huanghe, 100-150 km at the mouth of the Changjiang, 20-30 km at the mouth of the Song Hong, 30-40 km at the mouth of the Mekong River, and 10-25 km at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River (Table 3 .1.1). Moreover, recently Asian deltas have suffered and undergone rapid change as a result of human activities, particularly the construction of dams. (Data from Saito et al., 2001; Hori et al., 2002; Ta et al., 2002; Tanabe et al., 2003a, b.) Shoreline (MRC 2003) . More than 10 dams are planned or under construction in the drainage basin. The Chao Phraya River in Thailand has also been influenced by dam construction, resulting in decreased of discharge of sediment. The sediment load at Nakhon Sawan, about 300 km upstream of the river's mouth, showed a clear reduction after the Bhumipol and the Sirikit Dams were completed in 1965 and 1972, respectively. The sediment load of more than 30 million tons/ year before 1965 was reduced to less than 5 million tons/year by the 1990s (Winterwerp et al., 2005) . The Huanghe, which was once the second largest river in the world in terms of sediment discharge, delivers less than 10% of its former discharge because of dam construction and irrigation, resulting in serious coastal erosion. The Changjiang has also experienced a sediment-load reduction of more than 40%. Since a delta is defined as a convex coastal topographic feature formed by seaward shoreline migration, a stable shoreline is not a natural deltaic feature. In order to evaluate changes to deltas caused by human activities, it is important to understand that deltaic progradation is a natural state. Recently, Asian deltas have suffered as a result of human activities and have undergone rapid change. Moreover, the impacts of future global warming, notably sea-level rise, on deltaic coasts are of concern. Coastal erosion is a key issue. At a minimum, the evaluation of deltaic coasts and human impacts on the shoreline requires knowledge of the natural state of deltas and the natural changes that FIG. 3.1.6 . Shoreline migration/retreat in relation to sediment discharge from rivers. (After Saito 2005b.) they undergo. To prevent the erosion of present shorelines, appropriate quantities of sediments are needed, above a threshold value. If the sediment supplied from rivers decreases below this value, which is different for each river and delta, deltaic coasts experience serious coastal erosion problems ( Fig. 3.1.6) . We must know these basic values to increase our understanding of delta environments and to develop future measures against erosion. Tanabe S, Saito Y, Sato Y, Suzuki Y, Sinsakul S, Tiyapairach N, Chaimanee N (2003a) Stratigraphy and Holocene evolution of the mud-dominated Chao Phraya delta, The Seto Inland Sea suffered from the most serious water pollution and negative effects of eutrophication about 30-40 years ago when the sea was called \"the dying sea\". It has gradually recovered thanks to the strenuous efforts of a variety of groups and bodies, along with strong political and legal support. However, the Seto Inland Sea still has many eutrophication-related problems to be solved (Okaichi et al., 1997) . The lessons learned from the Seto Inland Sea are a valuable example of a successful case of eutrophication control. The basic mechanism of the eutrophication system found there is also applicable to other areas.",

The Seto Inland Sea has many narrow straits also inside the sea that connect many open areas of the sea with each other. Since the term \"Seto\" means strait in Japanese, the name of the Seto Inland Sea originally indicates an enclosed inland sea with many straits. This highly complicated structure of the sea provides both high environmental and biological diversity and also high biological productivity. This is due to a significantly long residence time of inflowing nutrients and also to strong water mixing in the area of each strait (Hashimoto et al., 1997) .",

Tidal flats are the most important habitat for bivalves and they also play an important role in the decomposition of organic matter -in other words, the purification of organic pollutants. Both seaweed beds and tidal flats have long been significantly decreased in the Seto Inland Sea. During the period 1978-1991, 1,500 ha of seaweed beds and 800 ha of tidal flats were lost from the Seto Inland Sea (Figs. 3.2.1 and 3.2.2), mainly due to reclamation, dredging, and other human activities. Since shallow areas area also valuable recreational spaces, it is very important to restore these lost environments. A significant portion of the natural coastline has been converted to manmade coastlines of upright concrete walls ( Fig. 3.2. 3) Those do not provide a suitable habitat for many organisms and other living resources. The fact that a significant portion of the shallow water area has been lost indicates that there has also been a loss of the buffer action against the pollutant load due to the uptake of nutrients or organic matter by living filters such as seaweeds and bivalves. Hence, in the case of artificial coastlines without shallow areas, terrestrial pollution load has a more direct impact on the coastal seawater. This is because of the lack of a bio-filter action, thereby enhancing the occurrence of algal blooms. The disappearance of shallow water areas, in particular of shallow slopes, has a strong effect on tidal water movement. Horizontal tidal excursion has been minimized by upright concrete walls, which then enhance water stratification causing a stronger algal bloom in the upper layer and oxygendepleted water in the deeper layer, especially during the summer season.",

Without stock replenishment, the catch of many benthic fish species has also gradually decreased. These substantial changes in fish catch statistics indicate a decrease in the stock level of living resources, in particular of benthic animals.

Although examination of the health of the coastal marine environment is widely accepted as a concept analogous to human health check-ups, a definition of marine environmental health and a practical methodology for carrying out such examination has not yet been adequately developed. A new scheme for health examinations as a new ecosystem-based approach to environmental monitoring and management was recently proposed, in which two major functions of the marine ecosystem are included. These two functions are ecosystem stability and smoothness of material cycling in the particular ecosystem under consideration. These functions will be very important both in sustainable fisheries and also in other types of utilization of the coastal environment in future. Based on the established \"Master Plan and Guidelines\", a preliminary health examination was conducted in 88 officially recognized enclosed coastal seas in Japan, among which a health examination of the Seto Inland Sea was also performed. The results of this preliminary examination pointed out the deterioration of the habitat with regard to the extent of the stability of the ecosystem.

Area-wide total pollutant control system An area-wide total pollutant control system has been implemented for every 5 years since 1979 in order to prevent water pollution in the Seto Inland Sea, Tokyo Bay and Ise Bay (Fig. 3.2.4 ). Under the system, target reductions and years for chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, and phosphorus were established for each sea area. Recently, the 6th total pollutant load control program has been implemented with a target year of 2009. Substantive means to reach the targetted reductions include: (1) development of household sewage treatment facilities; (2) application of total amount control standards with regard to industrial wastewater (50 m 3 or more per day on average); and (3) provision of guidance for small-scale and non-controlled industries and, farmers, stock raisers. 2. Relationship between COD load and COD concentration COD loads in 1979, the year that the area-wide total pollutant load control system started, were 1,012 t/day in the Seto Inland Sea, 477 t/day in Tokyo Bay, and 307 t/day in Ise Bay. Implementation of pollutant load control measures is expected to decrease these loads to 630 t/day, 228 t/day, and 203 t/day, respectively, by 2004. This is the year targeted by the basic policy on the 5th total pollutant load control program. The ratios of reduction in the period between 1979 and 2004 come to 38%, 52%, and 34%, respectively, for the Seto Inland Sea, Tokyo Bay, and Ise Bay, respectively. In accordance with the decrease in pollutant load, a generally proportional decrease in COD concentration was observed during the period, although the levels of load and concentration differ according to the area ( Fig. 3.2 .5). It is of note that the level for Osaka Bay in the Seto Inland Sea is very high compared with other areas of the Seto Inland Sea.",

Those for phosphorus were 62.91 t/ day, 41.2 t/day, and 24.4 t/day, respectively. When the pollutant loads of nitrogen and phosphorus in 1979 are compared to the reduction targets for 2004, expected decreases in nitrogen and phosphorus loads are estimated to be 15% and 39% in the Seto Inland Sea, 32% and 53% in Tokyo Bay, and 27% and 43% in Ise Bay, respectively. Consistent with the decrease in nitrogen and phosphorus load, relatively proportional decreases of nitrogen and phosphorus concentration were observed during the period (Figs. 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 respectively). However, the relationships for nitrogen and phosphorus differ slightly. It is also of note that the level for Osaka Bay in the Seto Inland Sea is very high compared with other areas of the Seto Inland Sea. In order to reduce the damage to fisheries due to red tides this law was revised in 1978 to include new policies aimed at preventing eutrophication. The amendment also made it a permanent law, and the law was renamed the Law Concerning Special Measures for Conservation of the Environment of the Seto Inland Sea. This legal system played a valuable role in eutrophication control and also worked as an effective countermeasure against environmental deterioration. Comprehensive conservation measures have been promoted under this legal system. To promote long-term policies relating to environmental management of the Seto Inland Sea in a comprehensive and systematic manner, the national government enacted the Basic Plan for the Environmental Management of the Seto Inland Sea, and the individual prefectures established their own prefectural plans for environmental management of the Seto Inland Sea. In 2000, the Basic Plan established in 1978 was completely revised. The revised plan enhanced conservation policies and added new policies in order to restore lost environments and promote wide-ranging cooperation and participation among the national government, local public organizations, private citizens, companies, and other entities.",

Decreases in sand eel stocks are more directly affected by habitat destruction due to large-scale sea-sand dredging for concrete construction industries. Among the four possible causes identified above, countermeasures against regime shift and long-term ecosystem change are very difficult or almost impossible to be achieved in a relatively short period of time.

As a result, the artificial structure is now working as a new seaweed bed and habitat.

In the Philippines, the inseparable relationship between land use and water quality has become a major issue in the coastal zone.

In the Philippines there have been reports on the outbreaks of toxic and harmful algal blooms associated with deteriorating water quality. From 1983 to 1994 there were 16 areas country-wide that were affected by red tide and shellfish poisoning (Deocadiz 1997). The major fish kill that occurred in Bolinao, Pangasinan in February 2002, was principally attributed to the increased mariculture activity in the area. It also coincided with a bloom of a dinoflagellate identified as Prorocentrum minimum, an organism associated with eutrophied waters (Azanza et al., 2005) . The decomposition of the high organic load contributed by the die-off of the bloom, and a large amount of unconsumed fish feed material, were considered significant factors as these used up oxygen in the water column and subsequently led to the fish kill. In most of the bays coastal pollution due to increased nutrient and pesticide concentrations is usually brought about by intensification of agri-aquaculture activities. The obvious increase in human population in the coastal areas also causes a consequent increase in domestic sewage. Other issues identified were siltation and contamination brought about by heavy metals from industries and mining related activities.",

However the data used in the assessment have wide concentration ranges; thus standard deviations from the mean were large. Hence, a simulation tool (Monte Carlo, Crystal Ball, Descioneering, Inc.) was used to assess and predict the probable status of a bay using the data obtained from the different sources. The purpose of the analysis was to forecast the likelihood that the ambient concentration will exceed the criteria value. The annual mean concentrations that passed the criteria, and their standard deviations, and the risk quotient (RQ = ambient concentration divided by the environmental criteria) were used in the simulation.

            "text": "Hazardous Chemicals 1. Organochlorine compounds In 2001 agreement was reached on the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). It is a global treaty designed to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants. POPs remain in the environment for long periods of time, become widely distributed globally, accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms, and are toxic to humans and wildlife. In implementing the Convention, governments will take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment. Organochlorine compounds (OCs) have been recognized as endocrine disrupting chemicals. Bioaccumulation, metabolization and transfer of these chemicals has given rise to concern about long-term and global environmental contamination, and serious biological impacts on marine animals (Holden 1978; O'Shea et al., 1980; Tanabe et al., 1983; Reijnders 1988; Tanabe and Tatsukawa 1991) . For monitoring marine environmental conditions, marine mammals are considered to be one of the most important biological indicators because they have a long life and occupy the highest ecological niche. Since the latter half of 1960s a mass die-off of marine mammals has often occurred in the closed areas of the northern hemisphere. In particular, mass die-offs of grey and ringed seals in the Baltic Sea, California sealions, belugas in the St. Lawrence River, Baikal seals, and Caspian seals are known to be linked to biological impacts of organochlorine compounds (Helle et al., 1976; Helle 1980; Bergman and Olsson 1986; DeLong et al., 1973; Reijnders 1980 Reijnders , 1986 B\u00e9land et al., 1987; Martineau et al., 1987; Grachev et al., 1989; Osterhaus et al., 1989; Forsyth et al., 1998; Kennedy et al., 2000; Miyazaki 2001) . Biological impacts such as uterine occlusion, skull-bone lesions, and pathological and immunological disorders have been observed in grey and ringed seals in the Baltic Sea. Distemper was considered to be the primary cause of a mass die-off of Baikal seals in 1987-1988 and 1998 , and Caspian seals in 1997 and 2000. Influenza A virus was also detected in Baikal seals, Caspian seals, and ringed seals in the Arctic Ocean. (Ohishi et al., 2002 (Ohishi et al., -2004 .",

            "text": "The levels of DDTs and PCBs in dolphin blubber were considerably higher than those of other OCs (e.g., CHLs, HCHs, HCB) since these compounds are highly persistent, relative lipophilic and less biodegradable. They are therefore retained in an animal's body for a long time (Tanabe and Tatsukawa 1991). The maximum level of DDTs, ranging from 80-96 \u00b5g/ g wet weight, was found in northern right whale dolphins from temperate waters. However, a similar concentration of DDTs has also been observed in animals from tropical waters. Higher concentration of DDTs has also been reported in surface seawater samples from open oceans (Iwata et al., 1993) . Probably the relatively higher levels of DDT found in tropical odontoceti species appear to reflect DDTs originating in tropical countries where they are still used for protection against malaria. The highest level of PCBs (76-130 \u00b5g/g wet wt) was recorded in Risso's dolphins from the Pacific coast of Japan, followed by melon-headed whales (51-55 \u00b5g/ wet wt) and Fraser's dolphin (38-76 \u00b5g/g). Odontoceti species from temperate and cold waters showed higher PCBs concentration than those from tropical waters. These elevated levels of PCB seemingly imply the ongoing use by and dispersion from mid-latitude countries in the northern hemisphere.",

All odontoceti species taken from the northern hemisphere showed much higher values of DDT, PCB, and HCH than did those from the southern hemisphere (Tanabe et al., 1983) . In particular, the concentrations found in odontoceti species were much higher in the mid-latitude waters of the Northern Hemisphere. In surface seawater, a higher concentration of DDTs, PCBs, and HCHs was also found in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere the mid-latitude areas were much more polluted by OCs than other areas, reflecting the extensive use of OCs in countries of the mid-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere. Thus, in Asian waters, it is very important to monitor pollution by organochlorine compounds, based on a well-organized, international research system. ",

Widespread use of these compounds has caused severe environmental contamination and severe biological impacts. On 5 October 2001 the International Marinetime Organization (IMO) adopted the \"International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships.\" This agreement prohibited the use of harmful organotins in anti-ouling paints used on ships by 1 January 2008.

In view of these investigations, control measures on the use of BTs have been adopted in several countries. However, such action has not appreciably reduced the consumption of organotins on a global scale (Kannan et al., 1995) . Environmental monitoring and toxicological studies dealing with water (Fent et al., 1991; Maguire and Tkacz 1985) , sediment (Quevauviller et al., 1994; Kan-atireklap et al., 1997; Maguire and Tkacz 1985) , mussels (Kan-atireklap et al., 1997) , and fish (Kannan et al., 1995; Fent 1992) imply that these compounds continue to pose a major ecotoxicological threat in the aquatic environment. Tanabe et al. (1998) determined the levels of butyltin concentrations in the livers of marine mammals. They showed higher levels in animals inhabiting coastal waters than those inhabiting pelagic waters. A higher concentration of BTs was found in animals from the waters of developed countries compared with those from developing ones, suggesting that waters in the developed countries have more serious BT contamination than those in developing ones ( Fig. 3.2.15 ). Kannan et al. (1995) analyzed concentrations of butyltin residues in the muscle tissue of fish collected from local markets and sea food shops in India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. They reported that intensive ship scrapping activities, sewage disposal and antifouling paints are considered the major sources of butyltins in these countries. The intake of butyltins by humans via consumption of fish in these countries was estimated at less than 25% of the tolerable daily intake of 250 ng/kg body weight/day. Butyltin concentrations in fish from Asia and Oceania were lower than those reported for Japan, Canada, and the USA. Nakata et al. (2002) studied biological effects using mitogen-induced responses in marine mammal and human lymphocytes by in vitro exposure to butyltins. Peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells isolated from Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), a California sealion (Zalophus californianus), a larga seal (Phoca largha), and humans (Homo sapiens) were exposed to varying concentrations of BTs. Concanavalin A-stimulated mitogenesis was found to be significantly suppressed (P < 0.01) when the cells were exposed to 300 nM (89 ng/ml) of TBT and 330 nM of DBT (77 ng/ml), while MBT showed little cytotoxicity at treatment levels of up to 3,600 nM (620 ng/ml) in the above marine mammals as well as in humans. This suggests that BTs could pose a serious threat to immune functions, and both TBT and DBT are much more toxic than MBT.",

(1999) reported clear evidence that BTs were accumulated in most of the organisms, in concentrations up to 50,000 times greater than in seawater ( Fig. 3.2.16) . However, there were no significant differences in the BT residue levels between the trophic levels. This means that there is no substantial biomagnification of these compounds through the food chain. This indicates that there is a big difference in the movement of organotin compounds in the ecosystem compared with organochlorine compounds. In particular, C. danilevskii is a highly sensitive animal to organotin compounds and is thus a most useful bio-indicator for ecotoxicological studies. A a three-generation experimental study can be done in a small glass beaker over a short period of time from June to September. Ohji et al. (2002 Ohji et al. ( -2004 implemented an experimental study of the biological effects at five levels of TBT (0, 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 ng/l) in the Caprelid amphipod C. danilevskii. They obtained the following interesting scientific evidence.(a) Embryonic exposure to TBT indicated that the female ratio of 36% in the control group dramatically changed to 55.6% at 10 ng/l to more than 80% at 100 ng/l and 1,000 ng/l. All specimens died at 10,000 ng/l (Fig. 3.2.17) . However, in contrast, no significant difference was observed in the sex ratio in response to TBT exposure after hatching. (b) Survival rate decreased drastically as the TBT concentration of exposure increased from 10 ng/l to 1,000 ng/l in both the embryonic and the posthatching stages (Fig. 3.2.18 ). (c) In both embryonic and post-hatching stages reproductive inhibitions such as brood loss and oogenensis inhibition occurred at even 10-100 ng/l exposure, a concentration which is often observed in more polluted coastal waters.",

However, even after the decision human health problems still remain among the local people. Recently the problem of mercury pollution from gold mining was also raised in the city of Manado, Indonesia and along the Amazon River, Brazil.

            "text": "According to Limbong et al. (2004) , the Ratatok area of North Sulawesi, Indonesia, has had a long history of gold mining following the activity of a Dutch company, Nederland Mybouw Maschapai during the period from 1887 to 1922. Artisanal or small groups of local people started to seek their fortune in gold mining, using techniques learned from the Dutch company. These consisted of excavating gold vein tunnels and using mercury amalgamation. In the Ratatotok artisanal gold mining area the concentration of mercury in the surface soil decreases from 5 mg/kg in dry weight at a distance of 5 m from the gold mining unit to 2 mg/kg at 30 m. This suggests the concentration gradually decreases with increasing distance of the sampling location from the gold mining unit. About 40 artisanal gold mining units are worked, mainly by informal, illegal and small, less-organized groups. The total number of local people living in coastal villages in this area is about 5,678, of whom about 8% are fishermen. Total fish production in the area is about 150,000 kg/year. Thus, mercury pollution by gold mining has become a severe environmental issue. Corresponding to gold bullion production of about 235 kg/year, total mercury emissions of 1,000 kg/year are spread through the amalgam-burning process. In the ecosystem, methylmercury is accumulated by biota and magnified through the food chain. Most of the mercury in fish tissue is methylmercury. Fish are probably the most common indirect route of exposure to humans. In humans, methylmercury can cause damage to the neurological, excretory and reproductive systems. Methylmercury is the form of mercury of greatest toxicological concern. Limbong et al. (2004) recommended that the gold-processing practices themselves should be improved, or changed to clean technologies, in order to guarantee minimal risk of poisoning the miners as well as the community, and that the Provincial Government of North Sulawesi should play a strong leadership role against the problem of mercury pollution.",

This trend has led to the complete loss and degradation of the ecosystem. In this section, we will review the past trends and present situation of these ecosystems in the region. Mangroves are mainly found in tropical latitudes growing in intertidal zones along coasts and estuaries in areas sheltered from strong tidal action and wind/sea storms. The occurrence and distribution of mangrove species are governed by various parameters such as temperature, wind/tidal range and frequency, availability of freshwater, soil type, terrain and salinity. On a local scale, factors such as salinity, temperature, the frequency and duration of tides, topography, sedimentation, and freshwater influx and light regime interact to produce environmental settings for the growth, zonation, and sustainability of different mangrove species.",

These areas have similar areal extents of mangrove forests, but the Indo-West Pacific region is about five times more diverse. The Indo-Malesia region has the most species (Duke et al., 1998) . Ricklefs and Latham (1993) provided an explanation for the high diversity in this region. Southeast Asia was the centre of the origin of mangrove speciation; the presence of an adjacent diverse terrestrial flora, and a constant wet humid climate may also have been contributory factors. The continuous presence of these factors since the end of the Cretaceous may have enabled diversity to continue to increase when conditions were not ideal elsewhere, or prevented species extinctions. In the latter sense, the Southeast Asian mangroves today represent an important refugium of mangrove biodiversity.",

Mangrove clearance also alters soils in many ways, including accelerating coastal soil erosion, increasing sedimentation transportation and reducing biodiversity of soil fauna. Other serious impacts caused by the destruction of mangroves are a reduction in biodiversity of both flora and fauna due to elimination of their habitats for shelter, spawning grounds, food and nurseries in the system, increasing levels of toxic chemicals causing an adverse effect on the quality of the surrounding water and depleting organic matter through leaching. All impacts caused by the clearance of mangroves will finally result in the loss of productivity of inshore and near shore fishery and have a serious adverse impact on coastal communities. In such communities large numbers of people are highly dependent on mangrove for food, income generation, protection from sea storms and other benefits.",

They grow best in estuaries and lagoons where they are often associated, physically and ecologically, with mangrove forests and coral reefs, often forming the ecotone between these two divergent ecosystems. Sea-grass bed, as an ecotone, is an area of tension between these two habitats. It mediates the structural and dynamic components of the neighboring ecosystems via control of material, water, and energy flows between them. More importantly, sea-grass meadows support a rich diversity of species from adjacent systems and provide primary refugia for both economically and ecologically important organisms. As such, sea-grasses are sensitive to fluctuations because species coming from their neighboring systems encounter \"marginal conditions\" and are at the extremes of their tolerance levels to environmental alterations. This sensitivity makes sea-grasses useful indicators of changes not easily observable in either coral reefs or mangrove forests.",

Limited scope of work -most of the studies are focused on only 10% of the sea grass flora and from only two biogeographic areas of the world. 3. The works are largely descriptive -published works are largely qualitative and not synthetic; hence, they have low predictive value compared to what is required for resource management. 4. There are gaps in basic knowledge -no information exists on the extent, status, and uses of sea-grass beds that are affected by sedimentation, pollution, and unsustainable fishing practices. 5. Lack of appreciation of sea grasses -the importance of sea grasses and of managing these resources is generally academic and peripheral. 6. Limited and uncoordinated research -coordination in the region's sea grass research is extremely limited and fragmented. 7. Misguided management efforts -these have remained focused mainly on identifying the problems and planning remedial or curative, not preventive measures; such efforts do not solve the problems that the marine and coastal environments face. 8. Lack of enforcement of legislation -simple rules and regulations protecting the coastal environment and resources are not implemented, or are often violated where such legislation exists. Marine policy in many member countries remains unenforced, for various reasons. 9. Lack of effective linkages -this is especially between marine science institutions (scientific production) and the productive sector (application). 10. Failure to consider the social and cultural dimensions -the sociocultural aspects of the problems sea grasses are facing have either not yet been studied or not perceived to be an integral part of the process. The above barriers are directly or indirectly related to the improper or nonuse of scientific knowledge that has been generated, coupled with the small importance (hence, support) governments in the region give to sea grasses. Addressing these barriers effectively would substantially reverse the trend in sea-grass ecosystem degradation in the region. The sad state of research on sea grasses is a reflection of the dismal state of marine science worldwide. In Southeast Asia the latter has been confronted. This includes the greatest barrier to its development and diffusion, namely the lack of effective linkages between science institutions (scientific production) and the productive sector (application). With it comes the other obstacles which, in the next decade, would still be a shortage of funds for research, low salaries for staff, lack of access to needed technologies, weak technical support infrastructure, poor public appreciation of coastal resources and environment, and the relatively small number of researchers trained in promoting an integrated management approach. Unless there is a substantial change in the legislative agenda on marine science within the majority of developing Southeast Asian countries, the lack of national commitments to support and encourage the development of the science will remain a major deterrent.

Fiji, Guam, Saipan, Cook Islands, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia are the major tourist destinations in the Pacific islands.",

The impacts on the coastal environment are usually classified as biophysical (e.g., congestion within resorts, pollution, litter, the removal of vegetation cover, soil erosion) and ecological (e.g., damage to fragile ecosystems such as coral reefs) (ESCAP 1995) . In recent years, the ecological aspects are being emphasized in coastal tourism, as this is threatening the region's marine biodiversity. In particular, the construction of hotels, beach clubs and marinas has degraded marine and coastal environments, particularly coral reefs through infilling, dredging and the resuspension of contaminated silt (UNEP 2001) .",

One common example is the removal of coral for construction purposes, thus removing the protection function of reefs, e.g., Candidasa in Bali. Sand is also mined for construction or for beach nourishment elsewhere, leading to coastal erosion and disappearance of small sandy islands. Inappropriate coastal protection structures, the most common being seawalls or groins, are constructed by developers without adequate understanding of beach processes (Wong 1998) . Seawalls constructed too close to the beach encourage erosion. The construction of groins leads to erosion on one side of the structure, e.g., the one-km extension of the airport in Bali affected 300 m of beach with erosion badly affecting the Pertamina cottages. These had to be subsequently protected by a series of minor groins and beach nourishment.",

Changing river mouths, particularly within monsoon Asia, are difficult to be incorporated into the landscape of coastal resorts. The river mouth normally opens during most of the year, but is closed by a sand bar during the onshore monsoon period, resulting in the retention of water that becomes putrid with time. Except for the Maldives and the countries in Oceania, few countries in the Asia-Pacific region have taken into consideration the potential impacts of a future sea-level rise on their coastal resorts (Wong 2005) .

The 23,000-ha Bintan Beach International Resort (BBIR), a joint development between Singapore and Indonesia, is currently the largest integrated resort in the region. Each hotel environmental management and monitoring plans must fall within the guidelines of regional environmental impact assessment for the integrated resort. Available data show that the overall quality of coastal water has been maintained within the guidelines since the coast was opened to resort development (Wong 2003) Rehabilitation would be a logical step for coastal resorts with an already degraded environment. Pattaya started its rehabilitation programme in 1997. The wastewater treatment capacity of approximately 13,000 m 3 /day was inadequate to handle a daily wastewater output of 20,000 m 3 /day.

Green Globle aims to be the primary global standard of environmental commitment by the global travel and tourism industry. Currently, Green Globe Asia-Pacific, based in Canberra, provides the environmental certification program for PATA. This would affect hotels, golf courses, marinas, and protected areas in the coastal areas of the Asia-Pacific region. PATA's own Green Leaf programme merged with Green Globe in 2000. The Green Globe programme is active in Australia,New Zealand, China and Indonesia (Green Globe website). Countries with a higher percentage of tourists interested in natural attractions are seeing the advantages of environmental certification programmes. Since 1987, a certification scheme for beaches and marinas has been applied in Europe under the Blue Flag (an ecolabeling programe for beaches in Europe). UNEP supported a feasibility workshop on the Blue Flag for Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines in August 1999 but nothing has yet been implemented in these countries.",

The world's first such case was the sinking of the Liberian supertanker, the Torry Canyon, at Lands End, off the coast of southwest England in March 1967 (Fig. 3.6.1) . As a result of the accident approximately 93,000 kl of crude oil on the ship spewed out, and contaminated a total distance of about 300 km along the southwestern coastline of England and the northwestern coastline of France. It is well recognized that the accident triggered a reexamination of the direct application of the \"polluters pay principle\". After the first attempt by a Dutch company to salvage the vessel failed, the tanker owner, Bermuda Tanker, abandoned its ownership. Nothing was done to the wrecked ship for about 10 days. Finally the UK government decided to bomb the ship using a Royal Navy fighter jet, as they realized the polluter showed no \"good will\" to clean up the wreckage and respond to the spill. Although the accident brought about enormous environmental damage, it also promoted the establishment of the Marine Pollution Control Unit (MPCU) in the UK, as well as the Fund Convention in 1971 and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships in 1973.",

Both Korea and Japan experienced \"shoreline shocks\" relatively recently. After the accidents they started to revise their spill response and disaster management systems. Before these shocks the two countries employed quite similar systems and legal provisions for oil spill accidents. But in the past few years the systems used by each country have become highly differentiated. Problems that are derived from the different approaches used by each country, and the possibility of a uniform approach to tackling oil contingencies, will be discussed in the following sections.",

After that, oily wastes were recovered by trucks, and the oily shorelines were swept by ships. Moreover, weathered oil and oily wastes were recovered manually with ladles and shovels, mainly by policemen and local residents. People even wiped off oil adhering to the surface of rocks and stones, using rags and sorbent. Stranded oil penetrated into the subsurface of the beach so excavators for construction were used to recover oily sand gravel. This was washed by sorbent and dispersant. This mechanical removal was carried out mainly around Sori Island as the island was heavily contaminated. Other areas deluged by oil were cleaned largely by hand. Many people and a great deal of time were thus required for the cleanup. To make matters worse, the accident occurred in the summer season, so the high temperature made the stranded oil lose viscosity. Low viscosity oil was hard to recover, so cleanup operations along the shoreline had to be carried out for 5 months from July 25 to December 31, 1995 (Lee 2001) .",

So many inappropriate cleanup activities were also carried out here and there. Use of chemical solvents has to be a good example. Exxon's chemical solvent, ISOPAR H, was actually used not only for washing the cleanup crews' property such as clothes and gloves, but also for wiping the oil off the rocks. An important fact is that Mikuni Town officials explained that ISOPAR H was an \"earth-friendly detergent\" and they recommended volunteers use it for recovery work. Volunteers believed this \"official information\", so some workers washed their hands and even their faces with it because public officials had said that ISOPAR H was \"Senzai\", which means detergent or soap in Japanese (Sawano 1998) .",

As for oil spill-combating materials, such as dispersant and sorbent, their quantity was also very limited for an initial response. Since the Sea Prince accident the central government has set 10,000 t of response capacity as the numerical target of the National Marine Police Agency, and they have started to improve their capabilities. Their final goal is to deploy 23 collection vessels, 84 skimmers, six \"500-G/T-class\" barges, and 220 response personnel by the end of 2004.",
