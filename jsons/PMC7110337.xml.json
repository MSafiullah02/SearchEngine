A virion is composed of viral proteins, nucleic acid, lipids and carbohydrates. The structural proteins of viruses protect the viral genome, participate in attachment of virus to a susceptible cell, facilitate transfer of viral nucleic acid from one host cell to another and are antigenic determinants of the virus. Viral envelopes contain lipids and glycoproteins (gp), the lipids are derived from the host cell while the glycoproteins are virus-encoded. Surface glycoproteins attach the virus to a target cell and are important viral antigens. Viral proteins coded by nonstructural genes are known as nonstructural proteins (NS). Present in the virus-infected cells, these proteins appear to have regulatory roles during replication. To give a few examples, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genes code for NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B nonstructural proteins. The mature structural proteins are C, E1 and E2 [6].",

            "text": "Three proteins have been identified in mammals, GLABROUS1 (GLI), GLI2, and GLI3, having a highly conserved zinc finger (ZF) domain and function as transcription factors in the vertebrate sonic hedgehog-patched signaling pathway [7]. During evolution some proteins have chosen Mg2+ as a natural cofactor. Mg-binding sites appear to be weak and can be replaced by other divalent metals like Zn2+, and in some cases, inhibit enzymatic activity thereby. Therefore, it seems that the cell machinery governs the process of metal binding by regulating appropriate concentrations of Mg2+ and Zn2+, etc. in various biological compartments. Zn2+ has a higher affinity for a protein ligand and strongly prefers a tetrahedral geometry. Consequently, rigid Zn2+-binding sites appear to be more selective than Mg2+-binding sites, and a protein can generally select Zn2+ against the background of a much higher Mg2+ concentration [8]. The commonest metal to bind with a virus-protein is zinc. Zinc is the second most abundant trace metal found in eukaryotic organisms, second only to iron. Zinc is required for essential catalytic functions in more than 300 enzymes, stabilization and induction of the folding of protein subdomains. The latter functions include the essential role of zinc in the folding of the DNA-binding domains of eukaryotic transcription factors, including the ZF transcription factors [9]. ZF are small protein domains in which zinc plays a structural role contributing to the stability of the domain and are small DNA-binding peptide motifs. The cysteine-rich zinc-binding motifs known as the RING and B-box are found in several unrelated proteins. ZF are structurally diverse and are present among proteins that perform a broad range of functions in various cellular processes, such as replication and repair, transcription and translation, metabolism and signaling, cell proliferation and apoptosis. ZF typically function as interaction modules and bind to a wide variety of compounds, such as nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules. Three of these fold groups comprise the majority of zinc fingers, namely, C2H2-like finger, treble clef finger and the zinc ribbon [10].",

The NCp of HIV-1 has two ZF, each containing the invariant metal ion binding residues CCHC (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). Guo et al. [12] reported that mutations in the CCHC motifs are deleterious for reverse transcription in vivo. ZF contribute to the role of NC in complete tRNA primer removal from minus-strand DNA during plus-strand transfer. Annealing of the primer binding site sequences in plus-strand strong-stop DNA to its complement in minus-strand acceptor DNA is not dependent on NC ZF. NC ZF are needed to unfold highly structured RNA and DNA strand transfer intermediates [12]. Thus, it appears that in these cases, ZF interactions are important components of NC nucleic acid chaperone activity. Heath et al. [38] suggested that ZF 1 has a greater role in unfolding of strong secondary structures, whereas ZF 2 serves an accessory role that leads to a further increase in the rate of annealing.",

The R region contains the highly stable transactivation response (TAR)\u2013RNA hairpin. NC variants with mutations in their ZF domains have dramatically altered TAR\u2013RNA binding interactions relative to wild-type NC [14].

[42] investigated the Zn2+ binding and acid\u2013base properties of four single-point mutants of a short peptide corresponding to the distal finger motif of NCp7. In each mutant, one Zn2+-coordinating residue is substituted with a noncoordinating one. Using the spectroscopic properties of Co2+, it was establish that the four mutants retain their ability to bind a metal cation. The mutations do not affect the acid\u2013base properties of the Zn2+-coordinating residues. The apparent Zn2+ binding constants of the four mutants are strongly reduced compared to those of the native peptide but are similar to those of various host Zn2+ binding proteins. As a consequence, the loss of viral infectivity following the mutation of one Zn2+-coordinating residue in vivo may not be related to the total loss of Zn2+ binding. The pH dependence of Zn2+ binding indicates that the coordinating residues bind Zn2+ stepwise and that the free energy provided by the binding of a given residue may be modulated by the entropic contribution of the residues already bound to Zn2+\n[42]. This implies that Cys49 may act as a switch for Zn2+ dissociation in the distal finger motif of NCp7, a feature that may contribute to the high susceptibility of Cys49 to electrophilic attack.",

All Co2+-substituted peptide complexes adopt tetrahedral ligand geometries and have S\u2013>Co2+ ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition intensities consistent with three Co2+\u2013S bonds for F1-SC and F1-CS [47]. ZF domains in retroviral NCp usually contain one histidine per metal ion coordination Cys complex. Visna virus NC8, has two additional histidines (in the second of its two ZFs) that could potentially bind metal ions. Absorption spectra of cobalt-bound ZF2 peptides are altered by Cys alkylation and mutation, but not by mutation of the extra histidines. Further, visna p8 ZFs involve three Cys and one His in the canonical spacing in metal ion coordination, and that the two additional histidines appear to interact with nucleic acid bases in p8-DNA complexes [48]. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is the prototypical eukaryotic selenoprotein, with the rare amino acid selenocysteine at the enzyme active site, encoded by the UGA codon in RNA. Selenium-dependent GPx modules are encoded in a number of RNA viruses, including potentially serious human pathogens like HIV-1, HIV-2, coxsackievirus B3 and measles virus [49]. Tan et al. [50] prepared proteins consisting of wild type or truncated HIV-1 integrase fused to the synthetic polydactyl ZF protein E2C. The purified fusion proteins bind specifically to the 18-bp E2C recognition sequence. Thus, the integrase-E2C fusion proteins offer an efficient approach and a versatile framework for directing the integration of retroviral DNA into a predetermined DNA site.",

            "text": "The NS3 region of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes for a serine protease activity, which is necessary for the processing of the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein. The minimal domain with proteolytic activity resides in the N terminus, where a structural tetradentate zinc-binding site is located. The zinc-binding site has a role in maintaining the structural stability and guiding the folding of the NS3 serine proteinase domain. The ligands have been identified by X-ray crystallography as three cysteines and one histidine residue, postulated to coordinate the metal through a water molecule. The structure of NS3 proteinase from HCV BK strain has a substrate-binding site consistent with the cleavage specificity of the enzyme. Novel features include a structural zinc-binding site and a long N-terminus that interacts with neighboring molecules by binding to a hydrophobic surface patch [51]. Evidence for rearrangements of the metal coordination geometry induced by complex formation with an NS4A peptide cofactor have been reported [18]. The HCV NS3 protein N-terminal domain has a zinc-binding site exposed on the surface [52], [53]. The HCV enzyme contains Zn2+ with NS3 ligation and that the metal is required for structural integrity and activity of the enzyme. HCV polyprotein processing is activated by Zn2+ and, to a lesser degree, by Cd2+, Pb2+, and Co2+ and is inhibited by Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions [54]. Zn2+ is not directly involved in catalysis but may have a structural role [55]. It is suggested that the three cysteines, and the histidines coordinate the structural zinc in the HCV NS3 proteinase at a Zn2+-binding site while dengue 2 virus NS3 protease, though lot of homology, does not contain a Zn2+-binding site [56]. Zn2+-dependent HCV NS3 inhibition is relatively insensitive to the structural variations but dependent on the presence of negatively charged functionality [57]. This can be interpreted in the context of an initial electrostatic interaction between protease and inhibitor that is subsequently consolidated by Zn2+, with binding facilitated by the featureless active site and proximal regions of the HCV NS3 protein. NS5A gene product displays a multitude of activities related to enhancement of viral pathogenesis. A complex multimechanistic role of NS5A in promoting viral persistence, pathogenesis and, indirectly, viral-related hepatocarcinogenesis indicates its key role in HCV pathobiology [58]. Potentionmetric and spectroscopic data have shown that a fragment of envelope proteins of the hepatitis B virus could be a very specific binding molecule for Cu2+ ions using arginine lateral NH2 donor sites. The presence of Pro and Asp residues makes Arg binding not only very specific, but also very efficient [19].",

[20] have reported that the herpes simplex virus, HSV-1, infected cell proteins (ICP0) and virion host shutoff protein (vhs) function in concert to disable the host antiviral response. ICP0 also blocks IFN regulatory factor IRF3- and IRF7-mediated activation of IFN-stimulated genes and that the RING finger domain of ICP0 is essential for this activity. Furthermore, HSV-1 modifies the IRF3 pathway in a manner different from that of the small RNA viruses most commonly studied [20]. The GLI-induced transcriptional activation requires the carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The presence of this region in the GLI activation domain provides a mechanism for GLI-induced transcriptional regulation [7]. Proteasome-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins plays a key role in many important cellular processes. One class of E3 ubiquitin ligases has been shown to contain a common zinc-binding RING finger motif. It has been shown that HSV1 ICP0, itself a RING finger protein, induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of several cellular proteins and induces the accumulation of colocalizing conjugated ubiquitin in vivo. Mutations within the RING finger region that abolish the in vitro ubiquitination activity also cause severe reductions in ICP0 activity in other assays [59]. It shows that ICP0 has the potential to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase during viral infection and to target specific cellular proteins for destruction by the 26S proteasome.",

Site-specific mutagenesis of the ZF RING of bICP0 demonstrates that it is important for inducing aggregated chromatin structures in transfected cells and toxicity.

Sequencing of the A45R gene from other orthopoxviruses shows that the protein is highly conserved in all viruses sequenced, including 16 strains of VV, 2 strains of cowpox virus, camelpox virus, and 4 strains of variola virus (reviewed in [22]). In all cases the protein lacks key residues involved in metal ion binding that are important for the catalytic activity. A45R is unusual that affects neither virus replication nor virulence. Molluscum contagiosum, a DNA virus, has been shown to encode a functional selenium-dependent GPx enzyme [49]. Many Chordopoxviruses encode catalytically inactive homologs of cellular Cu\u2013Zn SOD. The biological function of these proteins is unknown, although the proteins encoded by Leporipoxviruses have been shown to promote a slow decline in the level of SOD activity in virus-infected cells. Teoh et al. [60] have reported that Shope fibroma virus SOD retains the zinc binding properties of its cellular homolog, but cannot bind copper. Further, recombinant Shope fibroma virus SOD forms very stable complexes with cellular copper chaperones for SOD. Similar viral SOD/chaperone complexes are formed in cells infected with a closely related myxoma virus. These poxviral SOD homologs do not form stable complexes with cellular Cu, Zn-SOD or affect its concentration [60].",

The wild-type protein has very high specificity for Cu2+ and is only partially inhibited by 1 mM nickel (Ni2+), platinum (Pt2+), and Zn2+\n[24]. The M1 protein has a peptide linker (M1Lnk).

A small but significant portion of the M1 protein is bound to Zn2+ in the virion.

The influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein complex contains an associated RNA endonuclease activity, which is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. Virus-specific RNA cleavage by endonuclease is observed with various metal ions, and maximum cleavage activity is obtained with Mn2+ or Co2+ and is much less with Mg2+. Synergistic activation of cleavage activity is observed with combinations of different metal ions at varying concentrations [25].

This suggests that the zinc in M1 has a structural role in the virion other than nucleic acid binding. A peptide synthesized to the ZF region of the M1 sequence of influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 is effective as a polymerase inhibitor. This peptide represents a ZF and has antiviral activity. Reduction in the number of residues involved in coordination of Zn2+ abolishes antiviral activity.

It was expected that ZF or analogs of ZF may provide a new class of antiviral agents effective against influenza virus and possibly other viruses, but has not happened so far. The data of Hui et al.

The metal binding site is also conserved in the chymotrypsin-like 2A cysteine proteinases of picornaviruses [34].

The coordination of the structural zinc in the HCV NS3 proteinase is mediated by Cys-97, Cys-99, Cys-145, and His-149.

Several NS facilitate the subsequent processes of genome replication and packaging [65]. The structural protein VP6 forms the middle layer in the triple-layered viral capsid with a central Zn2+ located on the 3-fold molecular axis [35]. The properties of VP6 depend on the presence of the centrally coordinated Zn2+ in the trimer. The wild-type VP6 depleted of the zinc behaves like the mutant protein and its susceptibility to proteases is greatly increased in the absence of zinc [66]. These observations suggest that VP6 trimers present a structural flexibility that is controlled by the presence of a Zn2+. The NS1 acts as IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). NS1 synthesized in rotavirus-infected cells binds IRF-3. The binding domain resides in the C terminus of NS1 and that the N-terminal conserved ZF is important but not sufficient to mediate binding to IRF-3 [36]. Therefore, the role for NS1 in rotavirus-infected cells appears to inhibit activation of IRF-3 and diminish the cellular IFN response.",

There is a conserved region between amino acids 37\u201381 which contains a generalized motif for a metal binding domain. All eight cysteine and two histidine residues in this short sequence are conserved between the simian and bovine NS53 [67]. The conservation of this domain despite extensive sequence diversity in the remainder of the protein suggests that this region is functionally important. Brottier et al. [68] demonstrated that the recombinant genomic segment 5 of bovine rotavirus (RF strain) protein binds zinc and is an RNA-binding protein as are several other ZF proteins. The NS2 self-assembles into homomultimers, binds single-stranded RNA nonspecifically, possesses an Mg2+-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity, and is a component of replication intermediates. The presence of Mg2+, Zn2+ and other divalent cations inhibit by approximately one-half the activity of NS2, due to the increased stability of the duplex substrate brought on by the cations. In contrast, under conditions where NSP2 functions as an NTPase, its helix-destabilizing activity is less sensitive to the presence of Mg2+, Zn2+, suggesting that in the cellular environment the two activities associated with the protein, helix destabilization and NTPase, may function together. In contrast, under conditions where NS2 functions as an NTPase, its helix-destabilizing activity is less sensitive to the presence of Mg2+, suggesting that in the cellular environment the two activities associated with the protein, helix destabilization and NTPase, may function together [69]. The octamers formed by the NS2 of rotavirus have RNA binding, helix unwinding, and Mg2+-dependent NTPase activities and play a crucial role in assembly of viral replication factories, viroplasms [70]. NTPase activity of NS2 may have a role subsequent to the formation of viroplasms, consistent with its suspected involvement in RNA packaging and/or replication.",

For example, it is not clear why metal ions tends to bind to viral nucleic acids indirectly via a water molecule whereas it tends to bind to proteins directly. The factors that define the energetically most favorable ligand coordination set and geometry for a given metal cation are ill defined. How does a viral protein select a specific metal cation from the mixture of ions in the surrounding fluids, for example why viral proteins and nucleoproteins choose mostly zinc ions? Is this selectivity due to (i) the natural abundance of the metal in the biological locality, or (ii) properties of the metal (e.g., its stereochemical and charge to size requirements), or (iii) properties of the protein (e.g., its unique set of amino acid residues forming the metal-binding pocket and the stereochemistry of this pocket)? Most of the studies have been done with zinc. There is a need to study interaction of various other metals with different viral proteins. Stray efforts have been made to use these approaches for the development of antiviral agents. A deeper understanding of these questions and lot more studies on structural basis for metal binding should prove useful in the early design and development of viral inhibitors that may lead to new drug discovery.",
