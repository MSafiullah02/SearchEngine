There were many kinds of specimens collected from one patient, but always only one specimen type was detected for positive of SARS-CoV-2, which indicated that specimen used for nucleic acid test should be collected from multiple body parts before discharge. There are 8 discharged patients tested positive only on the fourth test, including two tests before discharge and two tests after discharge, which shown that relatively high false negative rate was 36.4% (8/22) before the fourth test and suggested that increase the number of tests before discharge. The exact period of infection by far has not been determined, and the knowledge of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 were still insufficient so that we need to collect more information to explore.",
