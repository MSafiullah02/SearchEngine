Due to high contagiousness (2) , the disease has spread rapidly (3, 4) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has since confirmed (5) about 1.6 million cases worldwide, with its vast majority as of this writing ( April 11, 2020) in the United States and many countries in Europe. Most countries of the Global South are affected as well, often with reported case numbers just beginning to surge (6) . However, the currently reported low numbers, e.g. about 9000 cases in all of Africa, may be biased as only few individuals have been tested, see (7) for the example of South Africa, and also (8) . Furthermore, such countries operate under vastly different socio-economic conditions, with larger social inequality, distinct transportation options and weaker health care systems compared to those of most countries in the global north (9) (10) (11) , such that core characteristics of potential COVID-19 spreading dynamics and thus the effectiveness of specific countermeasures remain largely unknown for countries of the Global South.",

Symptoms often occur only after an incubation period of several days, with many infected responding entirely asymptomatic. Contagion may also occur via such symptom-free carriers, posing a challenge for tracing and estimating spreading patterns (12) . Transmission predominantly occurs through interactions while being at home, being at work, using shared transportation modes or during group-based leisure activities. In many countries of the Global South, most of these social activities occur under conditions drastically different from those in, for example, Europe or the U.S.. For instance, these countries feature, on average, more people per household, higher unemployment rates, more manual and lower payed work (13, 14) and much of publicly available transportation services used by the middle and low-income population are offered as paratransit shared-mobility services (15, 16) . Moreover, public health care services are different and often less well equipped than in countries of the Global North (11, 17) .",

The resulting contact network forms the basis for extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model dynamics with parameters adapted to COVID-19 (19) . Such agent-based simulations capture the inhomogeneity among the agents and are capable of modeling intricate nonlinear dynamic relationships between them, including a spreading rate that depends on the individual agent's detailed activities, their modes of transportation used, and their distance to each other (20) .",

As the number of reported cases seem to systematically underestimate their actual number by at least a factor of three, as predicted for Austria on April 10, 2020 (8), we estimate that on 9th of April, at least 100 cases existed in NMBM and take that as our initial condition. Starting simulations with the default scenario active, we find that critical cases are likely to vastly exceed the available ICU capacity ( Figure 3A ) within two months. In contrast, introducing the realistic lockdown scenario immediately, i.e. starting April 13th, might support a successful confinement of the number of critical COVID-19 patients in NMBM to manageable numbers ( Figure 3B ). In this scenario, the simulations suggest that there is about 80% likelihood that ICU capacity becomes overloaded at some time and that ,if overload occurs, it will be relatively mild (factor of 2-3 of the capacity, in contrast to factor of about 30 when keeping the default measures as they are). We remark that the success of such lockdown countermeasures crucially relies on several restrictions and our simulations likely under-rather than overestimate future case numbers. First in our simulations, activities are immediately reduced to the set low values (complete shutdown of public transport, child care and educational facilities, 90% reduction of all other activities) and all inhabitants fully comply with these restrictions. Second, our simulations are based on estimated parameters that thereby come with uncertainties, and stochastic dynamics may create large deviations from the predicted values, in particular also earlier growth and larger total num-ber of critical patients, not last due to an exponential growth of the outbreak in its initial phase without severe lockdown (compare (29) ). Third, our estimates assume that all ICU beds would be available exclusively for COVID-19 patients during the entire time of the outbreak. Those and other constraints call for a more conservative, especially earlier introduction of realistic countermeasures.",

It processes travel diaries from the 2004 Travel Survey to compute a synthetic population sample of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM). We employ the Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) framework for MATSim (32) to include the informal minibus taxi transit. In the underpinning MATSim, agents walk to a bus stop and request a DRT vehicle (in this case a minibus taxi). Their ride is pooled with rides of other agents with similar destinations. The simulated routing is more flexible than in reality, since the minibus taxis operate on a stop-based system with routes. Due to a lack of detailed data, this mode was implemented based on a door-to-door based operating scheme and pick ups waiting passengers from the stops. Consequently the vehicles are less frequented on the one hand but travel longer distances with passengers on board to pick up customers in the city on the other. This reduces the likelihood of being on a minibus with an infected person, but increases the contact time if an infected person is actually on board. The formal bus transport services in NMBM are provided by Algoa Bus Company (34) . Due to limited data on frequencies and schedules, the formerly bus passengers are assigned to the minibus taxis in the simulation.",

A fleet of 2,300 vehicles with a capacity of 15 optimises these criteria and was introduced into the model.

After an infection, an agent's state changes to infected but not contagious, due to incubation time. With the beginning of the fourth day after an infection, the agent's state changes to contagious. From this step on, the agent's differ in their behaviour. In the default scenario, 20 % of the agents put themselves into quarantine. The idea of the simulation model is that only a certain share of those suffering from COVID-19 notices symptoms. In addition, it is to be expected that some infected persons will go into public despite symptoms. The self-quarantine lasts 14 days and is assumed to mitigate social contacts completely, even within the household. 4.5 % of all infected agents become seriously sick on day 10 and of these, 25 % become critical the following day. In this way, a distinction is made between patients who require regular medical care and those who are dependent on ICUs.

Even if scenarios of harsh but realistically possible or complete lockdown were enacted only seven days after reaching 100 infected people, the outbreaks would still become macroscopic, with tens of thousands of infected people (Figure 1C and 1D) in the NMBM alone. Across all scenarios enacted, outbreak dynamics also causes overload of the approximately ICU beds estimated as baseline for NMBM (Figure 1E,F). As a precondition for successful containment, lockdown needs to be implemented sufficiently early on (in particular less than 7 days after the first 100 infected, not the first 100 confirmed infected).",

In our NMBM scenario simulations, ICU capacity would be exceeded by a factor of more than 200 without any countermeasures, by factor of about 20 with default measures, by a factor of 5 with realistic lockdown and still by a factor of 3 even with complete lockdown. These numbers underline the strong fragility of the health care services by example of the NMBM. We expect similar orders of magnitude of capacity exceedance throughout South Africa and in many countries of the Global South. Therefore, all realistic scenarios, including the default scenario currently enacted in South Africa, hardly seem capable of containing the COVID-19 pandemic without substantially overloading ICU availability. Our results suggest that such overload could even be expected if all the 267 ICU beds in both private and public hospitals within the entire Eastern Cape Province would be exclusively available for critical COVID-19 patients in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality only.",

A comparison to artificial settings where infections during minibus transit are neglected demonstrate the importance of the minibus taxi service as a driver for the spreading, in particular under partial lockdown.",
