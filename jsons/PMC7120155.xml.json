In fact, death from chronic lung disease is increasing, and as of 2017, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become the third leading cause of death in the United States in the past decade, disproportionately affecting the elderly [1]. Another lung disease, asthma, affects 1 in 13, or about 25 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics [2]. This is 7.6% of adults, more women than men, and 8.4% of children. Asthma is the leading chronic disease in children [3]. This disease has been increasing since the early 1980s in all age, sex, and racial groups. In Europe, lung disease represents 15% of all deaths \u2013 the fourth leading cause. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2008, 9.5 million people died from acute or chronic lung disease, representing one sixth of the global total deaths [4].",

Connective tissue in the lung is key for the passive diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide that characterizes alveolar-capillary gas [18]. Collagen homeostasis is vital to maintaining respiratory function, where collagen production and degradation are balanced. Dysregulated collagen homeostasis that favors collagen production over degradation can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and compromised lung function [24]. Some key nutrients to consider for collagen synthesis and cross-linking to maintain connective tissue integrity are vitamin C, vitamin B6, iron, copper, zinc [25], riboflavin, thiamin, and pantothenic acid [11].",

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is usually at the root of this. ACD is often the result of inflammation.

Typical iron markers , such as transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin, are also affected by inflammation and are less useful markers in chronic disease.

In fact, 90% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy are iron deficient. Inflammation also plays a role in iron homeostasis.

A few studies suggest that alpha-tocopherol found in sunflower and olive oils has a beneficial effect on FEV (forced expiratory volume), whereas gamma-tocopherol found in canola, soybean, and corn oils has a negative effect on FEV [81]. However, from these authors\u2019 perspective, this is likely due to the source and type of the oils, which can be inflammatory, rather than the form of vitamin E. For example, a recent study showed that gamma-tocopherol was protective in allergic asthma [82]. In addition, sufficient levels of vitamin E, in the alpha-tocopherol form, were found to reduce susceptibility of the elderly to acquiring pneumonia. Some of the positive effects of vitamin E are synergistic with vitamin C [83].",

It is also a heavy metal chelator. It is more effective than some other antioxidants because it is intracellular and extracellular. In isolated type II alveolar epithelial cells, extracellular glutathione inhibits hyperoxia-induced injury, inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and promotes cell growth. It is obviously very important to maintaining lung function as this is the inflammatory process that begins lung cell or tissue damage, as mentioned above. The highest levels of glutathione concentrations in the body are in the lungs, liver, and brain. GSH depletion leads to activation of NF-kB (pro-inflammatory signaling) and increased pro-inflammatory gene transcription and cytokine release from histone deacetylase suppression in epithelial cells. Total and reduced GSH concentrations are much lower in people with ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis than observed in healthy adults.

This influence in immune patterning can be seen through higher expression of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 and CD14 on peripheral blood cells, which implies possible desensitization to allergens in children [178]. T regulatory cells, which serve an important role in immune regulation and are thought to play an important role in asthma by suppressing the Th2 inflammatory response to harmless air particles, have been shown to be impaired in the cord blood of neonates at hereditary risk for allergy [179].",

Although this is extremely important, more attention needs to be directed toward emphasizing micronutrients and phytonutrients. Research is strong regarding the benefits of vitamins, minerals, and pre- and probiotics, and indeed, some integrative and functional practitioners are using vitamin and mineral nutritional therapy in oral, intramuscular, and intravenous applications, when allowed, in practice. A newer area of research is around nutraceuticals, including targeted vitamins, minerals, and plant-derived constituents concentrated to therapeutic doses.

The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of natural products against fibrosis. a TGF-b exerts a profibrotic effect through Smad-dependent [Target (1)] and Smad-independent pathways [Target (2)]. In the Smad-dependent pathway, TGF-b1 directly phosphorylates and activates the downstream mediator Smad2 and Smad3 through TGF-b receptor I, and then Smad2 and Smad3 bind Smad4, which forms a complex that moves into the nucleus and initiates gene transcription. Smad7, transcribed by Smad3, is a negative regulator of TGF-b/Smad signaling, and the imbalance between Smad3 and Smad7 contributes to fibrosis. PI3K, ERK, and p38 MAPK are downstream mediators of the Smad-independent TGF-b pathway. PPARg [Target (3)] could inhibit TGF-b to reduce fibrosis, while CTGF [Target (4)], a matricellular protein, contributes to wound healing and virtually all fibrotic pathology. Additionally, Gas6 contributes to fibrosis through the TAM receptor, which further activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. Similarly, LPA triggers fibrosis through the LPA1 receptor [Target (5)] that stimulates b-catenin to induce fibrogenesis. The activation of the hedgehog pathway [Target (6)] induces the transcriptional activity of Gli to express target genes, which have an important role in interstitial fibrosis, undergoing myofibroblast transformation and proliferation. IL pathway [Target (7)] stimulates NF-kB [Target (8)] to activate TGF-b to induce fibrogenesis, while Nrf2 [Target (9)] antagonizes NF-kB activity to protect against fibrosis. b The chemical structures of isolated compounds and their therapeutic targets are presented.

Once an injury occurs in an organ, epithelial and/or endothelial cells are impaired, which results in the release of chemokines and growth factors, including IL-13 and TGF-b1. Macrophages and monocytes are recruited and activated, both of which further release cytokines and chemokines and further induce fibroblast activation. Activated fibroblasts transform into a-SMA-expressing myofibroblasts and migrate into the wound along the fibrin lattice. ECM is excessively accumulated, and some parenchymal cells (hepatic stellate cells in the liver, tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, alveolar epithelial cells in the lung, or cardiomyocytes in the heart) are further differentiated into myofibroblasts or fibroblasts by the stimulation of cytokines and chemokines, especially for TGF-b1. After the inflammatory phase, two events occur. One is the regeneration of injured tissues followed by wound contraction and reepithelialization. In contrast, once chronic injury, inflammation, and necrosis occur, myofibroblasts are perpetually activated, and excessive ECM is deposited, finally resulting in fibrosis formation.
