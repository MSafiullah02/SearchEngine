More interestingly, recent evidence has also shown these medications to lower lipid levels in systemic lupus erythematosus (LE) and to play a cardioprotective role in addition to lowering rates of thrombosis (1). Payne is credited with being the first in 1894 to prescribe an antimalarial, quinine, to treat patients with lupus (2). Quinine is a natural alkaloid isolated from the South American cinchona bark tree (3).",

Quinacrine replaced quinine as an antimalarial compound in World War II when over 3 million American servicemen each took quinacrine for 4 years. As well, Page effectively treated 18 cutaneous lupus patients who were resistant to treatment with quinine (5). In the 1950s the 4\u2010aminoquinoline derivatives of quinine, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, became well\u2010accepted drugs for the management of skin lupus as they were found to be more effective with more tolerable side effects in lupus patients (6).

The isoquinoline nucleus has a double benzene\u2010like structure with a chloride atom at position 7 and an alkyl side chain at the 4\u2010amino site. It is a chiral molecule with D and L forms (7). The clinical relevance of the chiral isoforms remains a subject of debate (8). The drug is manufactured as a diphosphate (aralen phosphate, resochin) for oral administration or as a hydrochloride for intramuscular injection (in the therapy of malaria\u2010induced coma). Approximately 60% of the diphosphate represents the base. It is water soluble and readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmacokinetics of the drug was reviewed by Krishna and White (9) and by Ducharme (10). After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached within 8\u201312 hours. Approximately 60% of the drug in the plasma is bound to protein. Doses of 250 mg daily lead to stable plasma concentrations of 100\u2013500 ng/mL (11). The drug is deposited in tissues with 200\u201320,000 times the plasma concentration found in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung (12). Significant accumulation of the drug also occurs in leukocytes. Highest concentrations of the drug are found in melanin\u2010containing cells in the retina and skin. As a result of this widespread tissue deposition, there is a large volume or distribution (over 100 L/kg) (9). Chloroquine undergoes hepatic biotransformation into two active metabolites, desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine via the cytochrome P450 enzymes (13, 14). Renal clearance accounts for half of the total systemic clearance and is increased by acidification of the urine. The pharmacokinetics is complex with plasma levels determined by the rate of distribution rather than by the rate of elimination. When the drug is discontinued after daily dosage for 2 weeks, plasma half\u2010life is initially 6\u20137 days with a gradual increase to 17 days after 4 weeks and a terminal half\u2010life of 30\u201360 days (7). Chloroquine remains in the skin for 6\u20137 months after cessation of therapy at a time when the drug is no longer detectable in the plasma (11).",

It is available for oral administration as hydroxychloroquine sulfate (plaquenil) of which 200 mg contains 155 mg base in chiral form. Hydroxychloroquine has similar pharmacokinetics to chloroquine with rapid gastrointestinal absorption, a large volume of distribution, and renal elimination. Hydroxychloroquine is N\u2010desethylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP 2D6, 2C8, 3A4 and 3A5 into N\u2010desethylhydroxychloroquine (15). Whether genotype differences in these enzymes affect the efficacy or toxicity of hydroxychloroquine is still unknown. Maximal clinical efficacy may take up to 3\u20136 months to achieve. Dose loading, with administration of higher doses (up to 1200 mg/day) for the first 6 weeks, has been shown to accelerate clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis (16), albeit with an increase in incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance. Interestingly, the efficacy of this drug has been correlated with drug blood concentrations in rheumatoid arthritis (17) and in systemic LE. In a recent study, whole blood drug concentrations were measured in 143 unselected systemic lupus patients receiving 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine for at least 6 months (18). A large variability in whole blood drug concentrations was noted possibly due to poor compliance and as of yet unknown interindividual pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean whole blood concentrations in patients with inactive disease (1079 ng/mL) was significantly higher than in patients with active disease (694 ng/mL) and a low level of blood hydroxychloroquine was a predictor of exacerbation during follow\u2010up, leading the authors to propose individual dosing schedules to maintain whole drug concentrations above 1000 ng/mL. Similar studies are not available for chloroquine. It has been stated, based on therapeutic response in rheumatoid arthritis, that hydroxychloroquine in approximately two\u2010thirds as effective as chloroquine and half as toxic (19). Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine readily cross the placenta. Hydroxychloroquine blood levels in the fetus are similar to those in the mother and are excreted in small amounts in breast milk (20).",

The foreign antigens are digested within the lysosomal cellular compartment and loaded onto a peptide groove of the class II MHC molecule. Chloroquine interferes with the digestion of these antigens and the subsequent presentation of these antigens to T cells (33). Chloroquine also prevents the dissociation of the invariant chain from the class II MHC molecule. This dissociation must occur for peptide loading to proceed. Thus, chloroquine interferes with class II MHC antigenic peptide loading (34). As self\u2010peptides are thought to be of relatively low affinity to the class II MHC molecules (35), it has been proposed that this process might preferentially diminish responses to self (36). Whereas lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine have been known to interfere with class II MHC\u2010restricted antigen presentation, they have recently been shown to increase the CD8 T\u2010cell responses against soluble antigens (37): A single 500\u2010mg dose of chloroquine, 1 day prior to hepatitis B vaccine booster dose immunization, increased the CD8 T\u2010cell response to the vaccine. It was shown that interference with soluble antigen degradation in the lysosomes increased export into the cytosol, where the soluble antigen could access the pathway leading to loading of class I MHC molecules for presentation to CD8 T cells. This dichotomous effect (inhibition of CD4 T\u2010cell stimulation and promotion of CD8 T\u2010cell stimulation), which still needs to be demonstrated with chronic antimalarial use, may explain in part the paucity of opportunistic infections during antimalarial therapy.",

A dose\u2010dependent inhibition of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106 by endotoxin\u2010stimulated whole blood was also noted (39). Although inhibition of T\u2010lymphocyte mediated cytokines such as IL\u20102, IL\u20104, and IFN\u2010\u03b3 is described (40), the major cellular target appears to be macrophages and monocytes whose IL\u20101 and IL\u20106 production is readily inhibited (41). Monotherapy of SLE patients with chloroquine results in a decrease in serum levels of IL\u20106, IL\u201018, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 (42). It has been suggested that antimalarial\u2010induced inhibition of TNF\u2010\u03b1 production, which mainly affects monocytes, may be independent of the lysosomotropic action of the drugs and related to nuclear effects (43). Chloroquine was shown to interfere with phosphorylation of extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 and the ERK\u2010activating kinases mitogen\u2010activating protein/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 and thus inhibit TNF\u2010\u03b1 production (44). However, many of these assays were conducted using concentrations at or above 10 \u00b5m, which are higher than attained in vivo and that may also result in mammalian cell growth inhibition.",

            "text": "A more potent effect of the antimalarials has recently been noted on the inhibition of stimulation of the toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 9 family receptors. TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses through activation of the innate immune system (45). Nanomolar rather than micromolar concentrations of chloroquine were shown to potently prevent bacterial DNA\u2010induced IL\u20106 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (46), an effect now known to be the result of inhibition of TLR\u20109 signaling. TLR\u20109, \u20108, \u20107, and \u20103 are all found within the endosomal compartment of antigen\u2010presenting cells and are susceptible to inhibition by lysosomotropic agents. In a recent mouse model, rheumatoid factor production by B cells could be induced by chromatin\u2010containing immune complexes, and this effect required signaling through TLR\u20109, which could be inhibited by chloroquine (47). In SLE, DNA and DNA\u2010associated auto\u2010antigens were shown to activate auto\u2010reactive B cells via sequential engagement of the B\u2010cell antigen receptor (BCR) and TLR\u20109. Likewise, TLR\u20107 signaling promotes the activation of autoreactive B cells by RNA and RNA\u2010associated autoantigens in SLE (48). Furthermore, necrotic synovial cells from RA patients induce pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production by synovial fibroblasts through a TLR\u20103\u2013mediated mechanism (49). DNA\u2010associated auto\u2010antigens also stimulate dendritic cells to produce inflammatory cytokines through TLR\u20109\u2013mediated signaling (50). All of these events are inhibited by low (and therapeutically relevant) concentrations of antimalarials. Taken together, these observations suggest that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a potent effect on TLR signaling, which may explain their efficacy in the treatment of SLE, RA, and possibly other inflammatory diseases (51, 52). As this effect is primarily on antigen\u2010presenting cells which initiate immune reactions, this may account for their delayed onset of action in the clinic (in that previously activated T cells and perhaps B cells are less readily inhibited).",

Quinacrine, but not chloroquine has been shown to affect matrix metalloprotein production by leukocytes (58).

Quinacrine was noted to increase the tolerance of lupus patients to light over 50 years ago (63). The increase in mean UVB erythema doses (MEDs) recently confirmed in lupus patients following 3 months of chloroquine therapy may be to the result of either the anti\u2010inflammatory or the photoprotective actions of the drug (42).

Antimicrobial effects upon HIV, SARS coronavirus, and influenza have been noted (69), related in part to interference with protein glycosylation.

Two studies indicate that such combination antimalarial use may be of benefit in skin disease (85, 86). Interestingly, the addition of quinacrine therapy to patients with stable systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone has been shown to decrease systemic activity scores, together with a lowering of serum levels of B lymphocyte activating factor (BLyS) and anticardiolipin antibody titers (87). With this antimalarial combination treatment, if clinical effect is achieved, then the hydroxychloroquine dosage may be lowered to 200 mg/day after 1 month, as well the quinacrine dosage may be lowered to reduce any side effects. Alternatively, chloroquine 250\u2013500 mg daily (maximum dosage 4 mg/kg lean bodyweight/day) may be used in cases not responding to hydroxychloroquine and can also be combined with quinacrine. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are avoided due to the risk of retinal toxicity. Clinical improvements with cutaneous LE are not seen until several weeks later with the use of antimalarials; therefore, 2 months is considered the standard time frame before changing to another therapy (88).

In addition, when two patients were taken off of hydroxychloroquine, the cutaneous rash flared up and cleared after receiving treatment again. Hydroxychloroquine has also been shown to be effective in childhood dermatomyositis as shown in a study consisting of nine patients with incomplete response to corticosteroids or flaring up when corticosteroids were lowered (103). With hydroxychloroquine, these patients showed significant improvement in cutaneous symptoms at 3 and 6 months and also had a reduction of proximal and abdominal muscle weakness. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended in the treatment of dermatomyositis with patients having cutaneous lesions not responding to steroids and in patients with cutaneous involvement without any muscle involvement (termed amyopathic dermatomyositis). Recently, the use of combination antimalarial treatment (with this addition of quinacrine to the 4\u2010amino quinolone) has been shown to be of benefit in patients that do not respond to a single 4\u2010amino quinolone antimalarial alone (104).",

In a study with nine patients that received less than 6.5 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine with a total cumulative dose of greater than 1000 g (1054\u20133923 g), no individuals acquired retinal toxicity (149). The second study being the largest retrospective study on hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity contained 1207 patients being followed up for 2 years also observed no toxicity in the same dosage range (150). Mackenzie followed up over 900 patients with rheumatoid arthritis over 7 years to determine retinopathy associated with cumulative and daily dosage regimens (151). From these patients, those that received greater than 1 kg of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were further observed to find that the mean daily dosage were: (i) 3.65 mg/kg/day of chloroquine and 6.49 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine in those that did not progress to retinopathy; (ii) 5.11 mg/kg/day of chloroquine and 7.77 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine in those that developed retinopathy. Therefore, Mackenzie concluded in his study that recommended safe dosages for chloroquine is less than 4 mg/kg/day and for hydroxychloroquine is less than 6.5 mg/kg/day to prevent retinopathy. A review of the literature has shown that chloroquine 250 mg/day is more oculotoxic than hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, whereas quinacrine has a relative lack of retinal toxicity (152, 153).

Chloroquine can reduce the bioavailability of ampicillin and increase cyclosporine levels (21). Kaolin and anti\u2010acids may decrease absorption of chloroquine and therefore the intake of these medications should not be within 4 hours of chloroquine therapy. Anti\u2010arrhythmic activity is possible with chloroquine as seen with amiodarone and chlorpromazine, and therefore caution should be used in prescribing these medications concurrently (21). Cimetidine tends to impair elimination of chloroquine. Simultaneous usage of chloroquine with hepatotoxic drugs increases the risk of hepatotoxicity and use with mefloquine with seizures (173, 174, 175). Antimalarials interfere with neuromuscular transmission and therefore should not be used in patients with disruption of neuromuscular transmission via predisposing conditions or secondary to medications. Smoking has been reported to inhibit the P450 enzyme system, decreasing the efficacy of antimalarial therapy (176). Furthermore, nicotine may inhibit the lysosomal uptake of antimalarials (177).
