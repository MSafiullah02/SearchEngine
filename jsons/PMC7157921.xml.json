            "text": "There is a great interest and increasing need for studying ligand\u2013receptor binding affinity due to the important role in drug development(Bertucci and Cimitan 2003), ligand selection(Morrill et al. 2003), antibody(Kim et al. 2012) and nuclei acid(Krusinski et al. 2010) developments, and understanding the mechanism of biomolecular interactions as well(Bertucci and Cimitan 2003; Kim et al. 2012; Krusinski et al. 2010; Morrill et al. 2003). A variety of methods have been developed for characterizing ligand\u2013receptor interactions such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)(Orosz and Ovadi 2002), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)(Chiad et al. 2009), ultra-violet/visible light (UV/VIS) spectrum(del Toro et al. 2008), surface plasmon resonance (SPR)(Homola 2008), surface acoustic wave devices (SAW)(Dragusanu et al., 2010, Mitsakakis and Gizeli, 2011) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)(Liu et al. 2005). The ELISA(Gochin et al. 2006) and UV/VIS spectrum require probe-labeling (del Toro et al. 2008). ITC usually needs a large sample amount(Jing and Bowser 2011). SPR has led to a commercialized equipment (BIAcore), which has been successfully utilized for ligand\u2013receptor interaction study(Bertucci and Cimitan 2003). However, the commercialized SPR equipment is still expensive and the cost for research is high. On the other hand, biosensors have been successfully used for detecting biomolecules and studying ligand\u2013receptor interactions(Chen et al., 2012, Dragusanu et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2005, Mitsakakis and Gizeli, 2011, Wang et al., 2005). Field-effect-transistor (FET)-based sensors have advantages such as low-cost, high sensitivity, label-free and real-time detection. Si-nanowire FETs, carbon nanotubes and graphene-based FETs have been used to find out the dissociation constants for protein\u2013protein interaction by using Langmuir equation for a one-binding site model(Chen et al., 2012, Lin et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2005). However, a receptor may have more than one binding site. It is very important to identify the number of binding sites on the receptor and the dissociation constants between the receptor and ligands at different binding sites. To the best of our knowledge, FET sensors have not yet been used for identifying the number of binding sites on a receptor and the dissociation constants of the receptor\u2013ligand complex, simultaneously.",

When an additional PBS solution was added on the sensor, an abrupt deep peak appeared and then quickly recovered to the baseline. This abrupt peak occurred due to the mechanical disturbance resulted from dropping the PBS droplet with a micropipette by hands. After the current went back to the original baseline, there was no net current change observed around 100 s. When the target concentration of 0.5 pM of the peptide was dropped onto the surface of the gate area, there was no significant current change. In sharp contrast, when the target concentration of 5 pM of the peptide was added, a clear current change was observed as the system reached a steady state. Real-time current monitoring spanned the range of target concentrations from 0.5 pM to 5 \u03bcM of the peptide. Upon these target concentrations of the peptide, the 50 pM gave a most significant current change. The current change gradually saturated as the peptide concentration increased. Eventually, no more current change increase was observed at high concentration of the peptide, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The background test (control experiment) was conducted with different concentrations of the short peptide showing no significant current change which demonstrated that there was no any non-specific binding on the chip, as shown in Fig. 2(b).

(5) using the dissociation constant extracted from Fig. 4(a) and the \u0394I/\u0394Imax obtained from the experimental results shown as dots versus the antigen concentration in log scale. It is obvious that the curve of the surface coverage ratio does not match well with those experimental dots. From eq. (5), it is shown that the surface coverage ratio actually depends on the ratio of dissociation constant to the concentration of antigen, that is K\nD/[Ag]. When K\nD equals to 10 folds or 10% of [Ag], the surface coverage ratio goes to around 9.09% and 90.91%, respectively. Beyond 90.91% or below 9.09% of the surface coverage ratio, increasing or decreasing the concentration of antigen does not change the surface coverage ratio much. Therefore, we conclude that for a one binding-site model, the most significant change of the surface coverage ratio is within the range of the antigen concentration between one order higher and one order lower than the value of the dissociation constant. This was also shown by experimental data in literature(Maehashi et al. 2009). Thus, ideally once the dissociation constant is determined, the highest sensitivity for the sensor is only within this two-order range of antigen concentration. On the other hand, for any experimental result, the surface coverage ratio between 9.09% and 90.91% should only cover two orders of antigen concentration for an ideal one-binding site model. However, in Fig. 4(b), it is significant that between 9.09% and 90.91% of the surface coverage, the experimental data points cover almost 4 orders of the antigen concentration. Therefore, it is not possible to fit these experimental points well into the surface coverage ratio with the one-binding site model. The wide range of the antigen concentration within that coverage ratio (9.09\u201390.91%) may be resulted from multiple binding-sites of the receptor. Compared with Fig. 4(a) and (b) is clearly more sensitive to see whether the model using the extracted dissociation constant can really fit into the experimental data. Thus, the surface coverage ratio versus the antigen concentration will be used for finding out the number of binding sites and the associated dissociation constants. Here a two-binding-site model is proposed as the following.",

The total current change is assumed to be the sum of the current change resulted from antibody\u2013antigen complex at site 1 and at site 2, respectively, as shown in eqs.

If we assume antigens bind at the two different binding sites of an antibody equally affect the conductance of the transistor, it is quite reasonable to allow \u0394Imax1=\u0394Imax2=\u0394Imax/2. Then the total surface coverage ratio \u03b1 can be expressed as the average of the two individual ones (\u03b11 and \u03b12) at the two binding sites as shown in eq. (11). We then fit this two-binding-site model into the experimental data points to find out the two dissociation constants, K\nD1 and K\nD2.(11)\u03b1=\u0394I\u0394Imax=\u03b11+\u03b122\n",

The model and the experimental data points perfectly fit together. The K\nD1 and K\nD2 are 4.404\u00d710\u221211\n M and 1.596\u00d710\u22129\n M, respectively. The correlation coefficient, r\n2 is 0.9948. These two binding constants are in a reasonable range of regular antibody\u2013antigen binding constants(Kim et al., 2012, Mitsakakis and Gizeli, 2011). The antigen, the peptide, consisting of only 20 amino acids is pretty small and the antibody is allowed to bind two antigens on its two binding sites. Because the two binding sites of an antibody are usually regarded as identical structures, the site 1 and site 2 in this reaction should not be recognized as two different sites. Instead, they are more preferably regarded as the binding sequence with the antigens. The difference between these two dissociation constants is probably ascribed to the stereo hindrance resulted from the first antigen\u2013antibody complex for the second one. It may be arguing that whether the assumption of equal maximum current changes for the two binding complexes is appropriate or not. If \u0394Imax1 and \u0394Imax2 are allowed to be variables and eq. (9) is used for the curve fitting (assuming \u0394Imax1=c1\u0394Imax and \u0394Imax1=c2\u0394Imax=(1\u2212c1)\u0394Imax), we can get c1=0.6862, c2=0.3079, K\nD1=7.875\u00d710\u221211\n M M, K\nD2=4.667\u00d710\u22129\n M and r\n2=0.9979. Fig. 5(b) shows the average surface coverage ratios derived from this non-equal maximum current changes for the two binding complexes. It is widely known that antibodies have two almost identical binding sites, as our experimental results predict. Therefore, this technique is adequate to determine the number of the binding sites of a receptor for its analyte. These two dissociation constants have less than one order of magnitude shift compared with the ones derived from the equal maximum current change for the two binding complexes. What happened if the high sensitivity region covers 5\u223c6 orders of magnitude? In that case, we may further need to consider a three-binding-site model. Now when we look back at the detection limit of the sensor, which is between 5\u201350 pM of the antigen is just consistent with the lower-half high sensitivity region of K\nD1 (between one order lower and the order of the dissociation constant). This result shows that the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are still very sensitive in low antigen concentration. However, the detection limit for the antigen of this sensor is not depending on the transistor, but on the affinity of the antibody\u2013antigen complex, that is, depending on its dissociation constant.",

            "text": "In summary, AlGaN/GaN HEMTs immobilized with antibodies can detect a short peptide consisting of 20 amino acids in a low detection limit (\u223c10 pM) which is proved to be depending on the dissociation constants between the short peptide and the antibody. It has been found that directly using the conventional linear regression of Langmuir isotherm equation to extract the dissociation constant may lead to incorrect dissociation constants due to ignoring the number of binding sites on the receptor for the ligand. Instead, through the analysis of surface coverage ratio versus the ligand concentration in the binding-site model, the number of binding sites of a receptor and the dissociation constants can be determined. In this study, two binding sites of the FHC antibody are predicted and two dissociation constants, 4.404\u00d710\u221211\n M and 1.596\u00d710\u22129\n M, are extracted by the analysis of experimental results with the binding-site model. The AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and the analysis of the surface coverage ratio are demonstrated to be good tools for the biological affinity study. Our future works will be utilizing this platform to study DNA\u2013protein and protein\u2013drug interactions such as the applications for DNA-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus protein package and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) drug development. Another future work is the advance toward to the binding-site models for different ligands competing with one another for the same receptors on our HEMT-based sensors.",
