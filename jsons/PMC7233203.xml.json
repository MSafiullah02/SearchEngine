The results of such informal and formal meetings to focus on the pandemic resulted in the establishment of universal testing protocols for pregnant patients, the suspension of all non-urgent surgeries, and the conversion of operative units to intensive care units (ICUs). In this letter we share the protocol for the care of patients in need of emergent gynecologic surgery.",

A PUI must wear a surgical mask and all personnel in contact with the PUI require personal protective equipment (PPE). This PPE includes an N95 mask underneath a surgical mask, a face shield or eye goggles, a gown, double gloves, head covering, and shoe covers. There are designated PPE coordinators in each unit to ensure proper distribution of supplies for the safety of staff.",

Once the patient is in the OR, only the anesthesia team remains in the room for anesthesia induction. Intubations are performed using the assistance of a video laryngoscope while the patient is placed under a clear plastic sheet to reduce viral spread. After intubation, the surgical team returns to the room which is then deemed a restricted zone to minimize all traffic in and out (Figure 1\n).",
