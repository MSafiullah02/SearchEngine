The pupil constricts when the light signal is carried to the tectal plate in the midbrain, then to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and then to the eye where it causes the motor fibers to contract, visualized clinically by pupil constriction. The pupillary light reflex, along with size and size differences between pupils (anisocoria), provides information regarding the functional status of both the optic and the oculomotor nerves.",

Similarly, the pupil\u2019s diameter and anisocoria were assessed by an approximate estimation. However, manual examination of the pupillary light reflex is subject to large inter-examiner discrepancies, as high as 40%, particularly when miosis is present. The discrepancy may be further increased in the presence of other confounding factors such as alcohol, drugs, or hypothermia [1]. Couret et al. observed an error rate of 20% and a 50% failure rate in the detection of anisocoria even for pupils of an intermediate size (2\u20134 mm) [2]. Larson et al. demonstrated that there was a complete failure in detecting the pupillary light reflex when manual examination was performed when the reflex amplitude was <0.3 mm [3]. The examiner would score the initial diameter of the pupil, followed by light stimulation. Reactivity was described as present or absent, or briskly reactive versus sluggishly reactive.",

In fact, pupillary constriction is mediated by the parasympathetic system, whereas dilation is mediated by the noradrenergic sympathetic fibers that are under the influence of stimuli, including stress and pain. A painful stimulus would typically evoke a pupillary dilation reflex. The potential for application of pupillometry for pain evaluation becomes even greater when dealing with the unconscious patient, during general anesthesia for example, where pain assessment scores have no value. Several studies have suggested the use of pupillometry in noncommunicative ICU adults. Paulus et al. demonstrated that pupillary dilation reflex evaluation may predict analgesia requirements during endotracheal aspiration [16]. Moreover, this method may be able to reveal different levels of analgesia and could have discriminatory properties regarding different types of noxious procedures [17]. Recently, scientific interest has been directed toward the use of specific protocols for pupillary dilation reflex assessment because of their low stimulation currents. The pupillary pain index protocol suggested in our approach has been previously investigated in anesthetized adults, revealing a significant correlation between pupillary dilation reflex and opioid administration [18]. Furthermore, Sabourdin et al. demonstrated that pupillary dilation reflex can be used to guide individual intraoperative remifentanil administration and therefore reduce intraoperative opioid consumption and postoperative rescue analgesia requirements [19].",

Using a linear probe placed transversally over the closed eyelid of the patient, the clinician can scan the optic nerve behind the eye, as a hypoechoic structure extending posteriorly from the retina. Measurements of its diameter should be taken 3 mm from the globe perpendicularly (as shown in Fig. 7), using an electronic caliper. The rationale behind this technique is related to the anatomy of the optic nerve, which originates directly from the central nervous system (CNS) and is surrounded by the meningeal sheaths and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): increases in ICP shift CSF into this space, which increases in diameter. This easy and repeatable technique carries one important pitfall, which is the artifact created by the retinal artery. This vessel runs close to the nerve and might appear as a hypoechoic bump that is particularly difficult to distinguish from the optic nerve. When any suspicion arises, color Doppler mode should be used to evaluate the presence of blood flow.",

The best ICP threshold estimated was 24.8 mmHg, which carried a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 91.2% [25]. Another useful tool to consider while estimating ICP using this technique is the pulsatility index. This is calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic flow velocities, divided by the mean velocity. Many studies have supported the interpretation of the pulsatility index as a tool to reflect distal cerebrovascular resistances, attributing a higher pulsatility index to higher cerebrovascular resistances [26]. However, the pulsatility index is not dependent solely on cerebrovascular resistances, but its value is the result of an interplay between cerebrovascular resistances, CPP, and compliance of the arterial bed. Some authors consider this parameter as less reliable for estimation of ICP [27], and it should therefore be used together with other noninvasive methods for estimation of ICP (transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasonography\u2014optic nerve sheath diameter, as already described).",

Guidelines agree on the importance of monitoring blood flow velocities noninvasively [28]. Transcranial Doppler and transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasonography play a pivotal role in the detection of this complication after aneurysmal SAH. Monitoring mean flow velocities is not enough, as an increase in flow velocity does not necessarily imply arterial narrowing. To differentiate this from cerebral hyperemia, Lindegaard et al. [29] introduced a ratio between either the middle cerebral artery or the anterior cerebral artery and the internal carotid artery, using a threshold of 3 as a diagnostic criterion. A Lindegaard ratio of 3 or above was diagnostic for vasospasm, a Lindegaard ratio of less than 3 indicated hyperemia, and a Lindegaard ratio of 6 was highly predictive of severe vasospasm. A blunt increase in flow velocities of 50 cm/s or more within 24 h is also predictive of vasospasm. In 2002, a modified Lindegaard ratio was published for the assessment of basilar vasospasm as a ratio between basilar artery and extracranial vertebral artery, using a cutoff of 2 to differentiate between vasospasm and hyperemia [30].",

Having identified the third ventricle, the clinician should use an electronic caliper to measure the distance between the ventricle and the inner part of the skull bone, bilaterally. The difference between the two measurements divided by two is the estimation of the midline shift.

Briefly, subcortical regions (e.g., the thalamus) produce small potentials that cannot be identified from electrodes placed on the scalp because an electric field decreases in strength by the square of the distance from its source (Fig. 11). However, because of the close and continuous interconnection between superficial and deep brain structures, surface EEG reflects the states of both cortical and subcortical areas. Dedicated monitors that automatically elaborate the frontal EEG trace are needed because a full-montage EEG during sedation requires cumbersome equipment and specialized training, not available to all intensivists. Moreover, a frontal processed EEG trace is considered reliable for the purposes of anesthesia/sedation monitoring even if some clinical conditions (see later) eventually require some knowledge of basic EEG principles. Processed EEG monitors deliver three main pieces of information: (1) the raw trace, (2) the numerical index of anesthesia/sedation depth, and (3) the 2D spectrogram (Fig. 12). The reader is referred to dedicated articles for details about the specific parameters [37].\n\n",

            "text": "Processed EEG was originally intended for the management of the anesthetic state during surgery to avoid accidental awareness and to titrate sedation in critically ill patients where clinical scales represent the gold standard. The inclusion of processed EEG into many multiparametric ICU monitors reflects the perceived need for ICU caregivers to use a comprehensive approach in the management of sedated patients. Deep sedation is clearly associated with poor short- and long-term outcomes in critically ill patients: prolonged mechanical ventilation and cognitive and psychological complications all increase hospital and ICU length of stay and mortality [38]. Although light sedation, with patients being able to communicate and cooperate at any time, represents a modern target of sedation and a standard of care in ICUs, moderate-to-deep sedation (e.g., a Richmond Agitation\u2013Sedation Scale [RASS] \u22643) may be needed in a non-negligible number of patients, including those with alcohol weaning syndromes complicated by uncontrolled agitation; complex ventilator\u2013patient desynchrony; refractory status epilepticus; intracranial hypertension; patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents; postsurgical patients requiring hemodynamic, temperature, or bleeding stabilization; post-cardiac arrest therapy (post-resuscitation care); or TBI. In these categories of patients, clinical scales (e.g., RASS, Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale [SAS]), unless they represent standardized assessment of sedation levels, cannot be applied. Moreover, they are commonly evaluated every 4\u20136 h, and may not detect periods of inadequate sedation occurring between assessments, whereas processed EEG is a continuous method of analysis. In addition, clinical scale assessment is performed by disturbing sedated or sleeping patients (processed EEG does not require modification of the sedation state) and can never identify phases of burst suppression or isoelectric traces (total suppression) [39], which are associated with negative outcomes (e.g., delirium occurrence, prolonged mechanical ventilation, mortality). In this context, in a post hoc analysis of a prospective observational study performed in 125 ICU patients under mechanical ventilation, burst suppression occurred in 39% of the cases and was an independent predictor of increased risk of death at 6 months [40]. Processed EEG values can vary greatly in patients sedated in the ICU because, unlike those undergoing painful surgery, patients in the ICU may not experience strong stimulation and therefore require relatively low levels of sedation, appearing calm with BIS values of around 60\u201380. Clinical procedures, spontaneous patient arousal, physiological sleep cycles, noise, and nursing activities may cause sedation levels to fluctuate. What is important to consider is that muscle activity (mainly) and electric devices (less frequently) may interfere with the ability of the system to process the raw trace, leading to falsely increased sedation indexes [41]. In order to limit this sort of artifact the companies are improving their devices keeping them more \u201cresistant\u201d to EMG interference.",

Using processed EEG systems as an objective guide for sedative dosing in critically ill patients can decrease the medical complications of oversedation, such as depressed cardiac contractility and hypotension. There are few studies on processed EEG monitoring in the ICU. The first was a prospective trial that randomized patient sedation to be assessed using the Ramsay Scale or BIS monitoring during propofol sedation that was stopped every 2 h [44]. A nurse-guided Ramsey score of 4 was the target in controls, and a BIS value of 70\u201380 was the target for the study group. A reduction in propofol of 50% was obtained in the BIS group versus controls. The second study [45] was a prospective randomized trial in which patients sedated with morphine and midazolam were randomized to sedation titration based on a BIS >0 versus clinical assessment. No difference was found in the total amount of administered sedative drugs, length of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay. In a recent study on 110 trauma patients, use of BIS resulted in a decrease in sedation and analgesia use, decrease in agitation, less failure to extubate, and fewer tracheostomies, with an approximate 4-day decreased length of stay [46].",

Nevertheless, depending on the frequencies of the ictal waveforms, processed EEG may have variable values that only skilled intensivists are able to read on the raw EEG trace to successfully understand this clinical condition. Processed EEG monitors can also be used to guide therapy aimed at minimizing cerebral metabolism rate to reach predefined levels of burst suppression [47]. A significant proportion of critically ill patients with altered mental status have nonconvulsive subclinical seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus [48]. Continuous EEG assessment for nonconvulsive subclinical seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus in patients with altered mental status can be indicated in patients with a history of epilepsy, fluctuating level of consciousness, acute brain injury, recent convulsive status epilepticus, stereotyped activity such as paroxysmal movements, nystagmus, twitching, jerking, hippus, and autonomic variability [49]. Nonconvulsive subclinical seizures, seizures with little or no overt clinical manifestations, can be detected with EEG monitoring.",

Moreover, it has become a mainstay for the early detection of vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal SAH. In the emergency department, expanding focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) assessment to brain ultrasound may enable the physician to become aware of increased ICP even before the patient is transported for a CT scan, and prompt early neuroprotective medical intervention.",

They require a global knowledge of technology and of EEG tracings to avoid misinterpretation, especially when muscle activity interferes with the processing algorithm. The use of processed EEG in the ICU could be much more complex than during anesthesia in the operating rooms. Nevertheless, processed EEG monitors offer advantages in the management of patients under moderate and deep sedation and in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents to avoid both awareness and burst suppression.
