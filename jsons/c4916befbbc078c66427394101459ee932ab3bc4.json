Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in nearly 1,000,000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 50,000 deaths. Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-toperson transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections. However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Despite the much lower crude fatality rate of COVID-19 (0.25% to 5%) than that of SARS (about 10%), the high number of patients affected in this ongoing pandemic due to a complete lack of population herd immunity resulted in a staggering number of deaths. 9 The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can vary from asymptomatic virus shedding among household contacts, mild upper respiratory tract infection, acute asymptomatic walking pneumonia, to symptomatic pneumonia with bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities on lung imaging studies, and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. 10 Though animal models of non-human primate, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transgenic mouse, and golden Syrian hamster successfully challenged by SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported, studies on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in human subjects are still largely lacking. [11] [12] [13] While bronchoalveolar lavage was frequently performed in severe COVID-19 patients for making a virological diagnosis, transbronchial or open lung biopsy for detecting the histopathological changes and host response in the human lung induced by SARS-CoV-2 was almost never performed for understanding the pathogenesis in these severe patients with respiratory failure.",

It is notable that the ex vivo lung tissue from each individual donor patient can be divided into two parts for parallel challenge by the test SARS-CoV-2 and the control SARS-CoV. Thus this ex vivo lung model system provides a unique opportunity for side by side comparison of the virological and host response characteristics that clinical studies on patients or animal models cannot achieve. The findings are important in understanding the relatively more efficient transmissibility of COVID-19 and the innate immune mechanism behind this phenomenon.",

These findings might explain the high viral load in the respiratory secretions of COVID-19 patients during the early days on presentation or even during incubation, and thus its high person-to-person transmissibility. 4 Studies of SARS-CoV in cell culture suggested that its N protein antagonized IFN\u03b2 response in a dose-dependent manner. 22 Moreover, two other SARS-CoV proteins, namely Orf3b and Orf6, also antagonise IFN synthesis and signalling pathway. 23 While SARS-CoV-2 is also postulated to possess IFN antagonising proteins, the exact identities of these proteins remain undetermined at this stage. The differential degrees of IFN inhibition by these viruses' IFN antagonising proteins may explain the discrepant viral replications and inflammatory responses in human lungs observed in the present study. Moreover, most proinflammatory A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 16 cytokines and chemokines except IP10, a chemoattractant for monocytes/macrophages, T cells and NK cells, were more significantly induced by SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV-2. This finding may explain the more severe disease and higher mortality of SARS than that of COVID-19.",

The viral kinetics and innate immune response profiles in ex vivo human lung tissue characterised in this study might help to explain this observation. The suboptimally activated innate immune response would allow SARS-CoV-2 to replicate to high levels in the respiratory tract early on and may contribute to its efficient person-to-person transmission via droplets or contact with contaminated respiratory secretions containing high viral loads. 4, 21, 25 Notably, the higher degree of viral infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissues corroborated with our recent finding that SARS-CoV-2 exhibited more efficient replication in Calu3 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells than SARS-CoV. 15 Our findings have important implications on the infection control and treatment strategies for COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2-infected patients may be infectious during the incubation period before onset of clinical symptoms due to its efficient suppression of host innate immune and proinflammatory response as evidenced by our findings. 26 ",

With immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV could infect human lung tissues as evidenced by viral N antigen expression in representative images of two donors (Figure 1). Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2-N antigens were consistently detected in higher abundance and in broader areas of the lung tissues of all donors than that of SARS-CoV-N antigens (Figure 1). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the relative fluorescent intensity of SARS-CoV-2-N antigen was significantly (P<0.0001 to 0.041) higher (2.30 to 2.87 folds) than SARS-CoV-N antigen in the donors' lung tissues (SupplementaryFigure 1). To more thoroughly quantify the different infectiveness and replication of the two viruses in human lung tissues, we inoculated additional lung tissue samples and measured the infectious virus titers generated at 2, 24, and 48hpi with plaque assays. Among the four lung tissues evaluated, the maximum SARS-CoV-2 titer increased between 2hpi and 48hpi ranged from 1.20logs to 2.04logs. With the same experimental setting, the maximum SARS-CoV titer increase between 2hpi and 48hpi ranged from 0.61log to 1.15logs only(Figure 2A). To determine the relative replicaiton capacity of the two viruses in lung tissues, we set the virus titer at 2hpi as the baseline, which represented the residual inoculum after inoculation and wash, and calculated the virus titer increase from the baseline",

Our data demonstrated that the 2003 SARS-CoV infection resulted in significant upregulation of types I (IFN\u03b2), II (IFN\u03b3), and III (IFN\u03bb1, IFN\u03bb2, and IFN\u03bb3) IFNs in human lung tissues. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not significantly trigger the expression of any IFN at all evaluated time points (Figure 4). In addition to types I, II, and III IFNs, we evaluated the four key pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 5A) and nine key proinflammatory chemokines (Figure 5B) that have critical roles in immune cell recruitment and activation. Our data showed that SARS-CoV infection resulted in significant activation of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) evaluated pro-inflammatory factors at either 24hpi or 48hpi. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection only significantly upregulated five of these 13 (38.46%) inflammatory mediators including IL6, MCP1, CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXLC10 (IP10). In addition, among all assessed IFNs and cytokines/chemokines, the expression of 12 out of 19 (63.16%) genes were significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung tissues in comparison to that of the SARS-CoV-infected samples (Figures 4 and 5). Only IP10 was significantly more induced by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV. Collectively, our results illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 generally triggered significantly lower levels of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines despite being capable of infecting and replicating in the human lung at significantly higher efficiency.",

While the innate immune response in infected cells is our first line of defence against acute viral infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not significantly trigger any IFN response at all, and only significantly activated 5 of 13 proinflammatory mediators. Thus, unlike SARS patients who generally presented with high fever followed by rapidly progressive pneumonia and then respiratory failure with a mortality rate of about 10%, only about 16% of COVID-19 patients are severely ill and less than 5% percent of them died.2,10 The low degree of innate immune activation could also account for the mild or even lack of symptoms in many COVID-19 patients who were not even tested and unknowingly spreading the virus in both community and hospital settings, making the pandemic control much more difficult than SARS.While both 2019 SARS-CoV-2 and 2003 SARS-CoV can attach and enter host cells via ACE2, the mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 overcome the innate immune response and suppress the IFN and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to achieve a higher degree of viral replication is still elusive. Despite that the N protein of both of these coronaviruses share 94% of amino acid similarity 3 , significantly higher N expression in terms of both the extent and intensity was readily observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected ex vivo lung tissues.",

Thus, unlike SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome which have viral loads peaking at day 7 to day 10 and therefore sufficient time for antivirals to act and reduce the peak viral loads, early initiation of antiviral therapy would be even more important to improve the clinical outcome of COVID-19.24,28 Moreover, the use of high-dose corticosteroids and antagonists against major inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 6 should only be used together with effective antivirals to avoid over-suppression of the innate immune response in COVID-19 patients as SARS-CoV-2 is already suppressing the host innate immune response at the beginning of the infection. 29 There were limitations in this study. First, the ex vivo human lung tissue explant culture is short-lasting and cannot represent the effect of host systemic inflammatory response and the adaptive immune response. Second, the supply of human lung tissues is limited and thus it was not possible for us to investigate the characteristics of different SARS-CoV-2 strains in this ex vivo model. More studies should be performed using both ex vivo lung and intestinal organoids to elucidate additional details on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvement.",
