One day after the infection of Pp, mice were intranasally infected with a mouse\u2010adapted strain of SARS\u2010CoV (Fr\u2010mo). Although Pp is of low virulence and causes only a mild respiratory disease, Pp\u2010infected mice showed a transient loss of bodyweight and ruffled hair from 1 to 3 days postinfection and then gradually recovered. However, mice coinfected with SARS\u2010CoV 1 day after Pp infection had severe weight loss and showed high mortality with exacerbated pneumonia (11). In this murine model of SARS, both control and UV\u2010V\u2010 or UV\u2010F\u2010V\u2010vaccinated mice showed a transient decrease in bodyweight until day 2 after SARS\u2010CoV infection (Fig. 1).

Similar to the results of whole virion vaccines as described above, mice vaccinated with DIs showed transient and minimal clinical symptoms, such as ruffled hair and weight loss until 3 days after Fr\u2010mo infection (Fig. 2, left). Severe symptoms continued during the observation period in control mice. On days 4\u20137 after virus infection, these mice suffered the loss of 40% or more of their bodyweight, and more than 80% of those mice died after exhibiting severe respiratory disease, whereas none of the mice vaccinated with recombinant DIs expressing S proteins died (Fig. 2, right). To further evaluate the vaccine effect, we measured serum neutralizing antibody and SARS\u2010CoV titer in the lung lavage of vaccinated mice. Before Pp and SARS\u2010CoV coinfection, vaccinated mice developed a high level of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV IgG with neutralizing activity (data not shown). As shown in Figure 3a, a high level of neutralizing antibody was maintained during coinfection experiments, at day 3 until day 7 postinfection in all vaccinated mouse groups. The SARS\u2010CoV titer in the lung lavage was high at day 3 postinfection, decreased at day 5 (Fig. 3b, blank column: alum only and DIs\u2010cont) and virus became undetectable at day 7 (data not shown). In contrast, the virus titers were significantly reduced in parallel with a high titer of plasma neutralizing antibody in all vaccinated groups (Fig. 3a). Therefore, both whole virion vaccines and vaccinia vector expressing spike protein were protective from a highly pathogenic pulmonary infection of SARS\u2010CoV in the presence of opportunistic infection by Pp in this case. Furthermore, the results by DIs\u2010S vaccine suggest that the neutralizing antibody against SARS\u2010CoV spike protein alone is highly effective for the prevention of SARS development.",

However, these cytokines became undetectable at day 4 postinfection. To better understand the involvement of cytokines in the lung pathogenesis of SARS, we simultaneously measured six cytokines (IL\u20106, IL\u201010, MCP\u20101, IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u201012p70) in the lung lavage of vaccinated or unvaccinated mice at day 3 after SARS\u2010CoV infection, when viruses replicate most extensively and vaccinated mice experienced maximum weight loss. As shown in Figure 4, the increased production of MCP\u20101 and IL\u20106 in the lungs of the control mouse group (alum and DIs\u2010cont) was strongly suppressed in vaccinated mice, which were able to control virus replication. Increased production of other cytokines, including TNF\u2010\u03b1, was not observed. Therefore, it is possible that IL\u20106 and MCP\u20101 play a role in the establishment of lung pathology in the Pp and SARS\u2010CoV coinfection model.",

Previously, we established four S\u2010protein\u2010specific monoclonal antibodies with potent in vitro neutralization activity (17). Among them, a major epitope of SKOT\u201020 localizes to the RBD of the S protein and exhibits the most potent neutralizing activity (18). To demonstrate that the anti\u2010spike neutralizing antibody is mainly responsible for the protective efficacy we observed in SARS model mice, we administered SKOT\u201020 i.p. once, just before Pp infection. As shown in Figure 5a, the mice treated with SKOT\u201020 recovered from the loss of bodyweight and were resistant to the fatal outcome as we observed in vaccinated mice.",

However, the cytokine profiles in these mice may be variably modified by Pp infection alone, SARS\u2010CoV infection, or both. Therefore, we measured 20 cytokines in lung lavages of these protected and unprotected mice by using a mouse cytokine 20\u2010plex antibody bead kit at day 0 (after Pp infection before SARS\u2010CoV infection), day 1, day 2 and day 3 after SARS\u2010CoV infection as previously reported (16). The production of two cytokines, IL\u20106 and MCP\u20101, were increased at days 2 and 3 after SARS\u2010CoV infection in association with high titers of SARS\u2010CoV, as shown in Figure 4. Interestingly, the production of IL\u20106 was increased by Pp infection alone, decreasing on day 1 and increasing again, whereas that of MCP\u20101 increased only after SARS\u2010CoV infection. These cytokines were not increased in protected mice (Fig. 6a), suggesting the importance of these two cytokines in the lung pathogenesis. Other cytokine profiles are shown in Figure 6b and c. The level of IP\u201010 was quite high after SARS\u2010CoV infection on day 1. However, even protected mice produced a high level of IP\u201010. In contrast, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u20101\u03b1, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and KC were produced only before SARS\u2010CoV infection and the levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and VEGF were consistently low.

The results shown in this paper suggest that whole virion vaccines, either with or without formalin treatment, and DIs\u2010S were protective against a highly pathogenic pulmonary infection of SARS\u2010CoV in the presence of opportunistic infection by Pp. By giving SKOT\u201020 just before SARS\u2010CoV infection, the mortality of mice coinfected with Pp and SARS\u2010CoV was dramatically reduced. The level of serum neutralizing antibody in these mice was proportionally high and a virus titer in the lung lavage after SARS\u2010CoV infection was substantially decreased in accordance with the concentration of neutralizing antibody given. Therefore, if a high titer of neutralizing IgG antibody against the S protein is systemically elicited by vaccination, it would be sufficient to prevent SARS development.",

(19) Subbarao et al. have shown that passive transfer of murine neutralizing antibodies can prevent replication of SARS\u2010CoV in the respiratory tract (20). This antibody has been shown to neutralize the virus in vitro and to prevent viral replication in a mouse model of SARS\u2010CoV infection. Sui et al. have investigated the antiviral activity of a human monoclonal antibody to the S1 protein that blocks receptor association (21), demonstrating the prophylactic effectiveness of this monoclonal antibody in vivo using a mouse model of SARS (9). Recently, several humanized monoclonal antibodies against the S protein have been developed for therapeutic application (22, 23). Many of the neutralizing antibodies against SARS\u2010CoV recognize a RBD in S1 of the spike protein, but other N\u2010terminal domains of the S1 and S2 domains also have neutralizing epitopes (8). For the passive immunization to be highly effective, a combination of neutralizing antibodies recognizing several epitopes of the S protein should be designed so that virus escape mutation can be prevented.",

When the levels of various cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of mice infected with Pp and SARS\u2010CoV were measured, high levels of only IP\u201010 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production were noted on day 2 following coinfection, but not on day 4 (11). Therefore, the involvement of these cytokines in the high pathogenesis caused by a coinfection with Pp and SARS CoV has been suggested. In this study, we observed that the production of IL\u20106 and MCP\u20101 were increased at day 3 after SARS\u2010CoV infection in association with high titers of SARS\u2010CoV, whereas these cytokines were not increased in vaccine\u2010protected mice. Therefore, we analyzed the kinetics of multiple cytokine and chemokine production in detail after Pp only and Pp and SARS\u2010CoV coinfection in na\u00efve and vaccinated mice. Although several cytokines and chemokines were ubiquitously and temporarily upregulated during the lung inflammation caused by these microbes, we found that the levels and profiles of IL\u20106 and MCP\u20101 production were well matched with the disease severity and protection. The contribution of these inflammatory cytokines to SARS in humans needs to be investigated further.",
