The ever\u2010changing nature of influenza viruses allows these agents to continuously evade host immunity and to pose a constant threat to human and animal health 1, 2. The acquisition of subtle alterations (antigenic drift), mainly amino acid changes in the viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA), is responsible for the yearly occurring influenza epidemics (seasonal influenza), which claim 36 000 lives per year in the Unites States alone 3. The exchange of entire genomic segments (reassortment) between influenza viruses of different subtypes in a co\u2010infected cell can result in the emergence of new viruses (antigenic shift), which, upon introduction into an immunological na\u00efve population, can initiate a pandemic spread (pandemic influenza) with potentially severe medical and social consequences 1, 4, 5. It is estimated that up to 50 million people, or about 2% of the world's population, succumbed to the influenza virus circulating in 1918, the causative agent of the disastrous Spanish influenza 6, 7. A distantly related virus, which emerged in Mexico in February 2009 8, 9, is responsible for the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, with 258 698 laboratory confirmed cases by 5 December 2009 (the number of actual cases is expected to be much higher) 10. Albeit infection by the 2009 H1N1 virus usually does not cause severe disease in patients without underlying illness, it is notable that the virus shows augmented pathogenicity in animal models compared to contemporary seasonal influenza viruses 11, 12, raising concerns that viral variants with increased pathogenicity might emerge in the course of the pandemic.",

However, the variability of influenza viruses compromises the antiviral defences directed against the surface proteins. Thus, as a result of antigenic drift, the vaccine needs to be reformulated on an annual basis to provide protection against the viral strains expected to be circulating during the next \u2018influenza season\u2019, and seasonal vaccination will not be effective against newly emerged viruses, like the 2009 H1N1 virus. In addition, viruses frequently acquire mutations, which confer resistance in the molecular targets of M2 and NA inhibitors 17. Therefore, novel strategies to combat influenza are required, which should be based on a thorough understanding of viral and host cell factors essential for influenza virus spread and pathogenesis. Proteolytic activation of the influenza virus HA by cellular enzymes is indispensable for the virus to transform into an infectious form 18, and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for intervention. However, the nature of the proteases, which activate human influenza viruses, is unclear. Recently, evidence was reported that type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) might play a major role 19, 20. Here, we will review our knowledge on proteolytic activation of human influenza viruses, with a particular focus on the role of TTSPs, and we will discuss the implications of different modes of HA activation for viral tropism, pathogenicity and antiviral intervention.",

The subunits function differently in the entry process: HA1 facilitates binding to receptors on the host cell surface while HA2 drives membrane fusion. Important receptor determinants for influenza viruses are alpha 2\u20136 (preferred by human viruses) and alpha 2\u20133 (preferred by avian viruses) linked sialic acids, which are bound by a pocket located in the membrane distal part of HA1 21, 22. Upon uptake of bound particles, which can proceed via multiple endocytic pathways 23, the low pH environment in endosomal vesicles induces conformational changes in HA2, which facilitate membrane fusion 24. The successful membrane merger requires the concerted action of several functional elements in HA2, including an N\u2010terminal fusion peptide (FP), the transmembrane domain and a central coiled coil, which is located between the FP and the transmembrane domain 21, 22. The membrane fusion reaction commences with a pH\u2010induced loop\u2010to\u2010helix transition of a sequence located between the FP and the coiled coil. As a consequence of this transition, the hydrophobic FP is propelled towards the target cell and inserts into the cellular membrane 21, 22. Subsequently, the C\u2010terminal extracellular portion of HA2 folds onto the central coiled coil in an antiparallel fashion, forming a stable post\u2010fusion structure in which the FP and the membrane anchor of HA are located in close proximity. As a result of this conformational change, the viral and the target cell membrane are pulled into close contact and ultimately fuse 21, 22.",

The influenza virus HA is initially synthesised as a precursor protein, HA0, in the secretory pathway of infected cells 21, 22. Despite proper glycosylation, folding and trimerisation of HA0 25, 26\u2014intimately connected processes 27\u2014HA0 is unable to mediate membrane fusion. To acquire its membrane fusion potential, HA0 must be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 by host cell proteases 18, 28, 29. Cleavage occurs at a linker sequence connecting the HA1 and HA2 subunits, which is located on a partially surface exposed loop, and proceeds in two steps. First, an endoprotease cleaves HA at the carboxyl terminus of an arginine located at the border between HA1 and HA2 and thereby generates the N\u2010terminus of mature HA2 28, 29. Subsequently, a carboxypeptidase removes the arginine and thereby creates the C\u2010terminus of mature HA1 30. Cleavage is associated with a structural change in HA, during which the FP, probably due to electrostatic interactions, inserts into a conserved cavity formed by residues within HA1 and HA2 31. This configuration is essential for fusion, since only the liberated (separated from the C\u2010terminus of HA1) FP is able to insert into the target cell membrane upon a low pH stimulus. Amino acids within the cavity and the FP are essential for membrane fusion and determine at which pH fusion is triggered 27, 32, suggesting that the cavity and the FP are potential targets for therapeutic intervention 28.",

            "text": "The nature of the linker sequence critically determines access to proteases, which in turn impacts viral tropism and pathogenicity, at least in the context of avian viruses. Thus, for low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) the linker consists of a single arginine (in some cases lysine), which is accessible to only a limited number of trypsin\u2010like proteases 28, 29. Tissue expression of these proteases is believed to be restricted to the respiratory tract (terrestrial birds) and gastrointestinal tract (water fowl, terrestrial birds). Consequently, viral replication is confined to these compartments. In contrast, the linker sequence in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) contains several arginines, with R\u2010X\u2010R/K\u2010R as consensus motif 33, 34, 35. This sequence is surface\u2010exposed and readily recognised by furin and PC5/6, members of the proprotein convertase family of eukaryotic subtilisin\u2010like serine endoproteases, which are ubiquitously expressed 36, 37. Therefore, HPAIVs can replicate systemically and cause severe disease. In this context, it needs to be noted that some HPAIVs do not harbour a furin consensus sequence. However, cleavability of these viruses might be increased due to the absence of a carbohydrate side chain, which would otherwise limit recognition by proteases 38, 39, 40, 41, or due to amino acid substitutions close to the cleavage site, which might increase surface exposure of this sequence and thus accessibility to proteases 21.",

            "text": "Early, groundbreaking studies on the activation of influenza viruses noted that viral infectivity correlated with the status of HA cleavage and that activation of viruses by trypsin correlated with HA cleavage 43, 44, 45. Within these studies it was also observed that some viruses contained cleaved HA and were highly infectious irrespective of the cellular systems used, while HA cleavage and infectivity of others were strongly dependent on the host cell 43, 44, 45. Viruses of the former phenotype were subsequently shown to harbour several arginine and lysine residues at the cleavage site 33, with an R\u2010X\u2010R/K\u2010R consensus sequence being indispensable for efficient cleavage 46. In addition, evidence was obtained that cleavage of HA might occur in the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN) 47. Stieneke\u2010Gr\u00f6ber and colleagues then demonstrated that these viruses are activated by furin (Figure 2) and that peptide derivatives spanning the R\u2010X\u2010R/K\u2010R consensus sequence were able to suppress viral spread 36. Furin, which is mainly expressed in the Golgi apparatus but also found on the cell surface, processes a host of cellular pro\u2010proteins in the secretory pathway and is indispensable for normal embryonic development 37. Increase of influenza virus pathogenicity in poultry is associated with acquisition of a multibasic cleavage site 1, 33, 48 and this effect is reversed when the cleavage site is mutated 49, underlining that the protease recognition site in HA of avian influenza viruses is an important determinant of pathogenicity. Nevertheless, introduction of a multibasic cleavage site is not necessarily sufficient to immediately transform a LPAIV into a HPAIV 50, suggesting that determinants in HA other than the cleavage site might contribute to viral pathogenicity. Besides influenza virus, several other viruses, including HIV 51, Respiratory Syncytial Virus 52 and Chikungunya virus 53, misuse furin and potentially related proteases (seven pro\u2010protein convertases were identified in humans: furin, PC2, PC1/3, PC4, PACE4, PC5/6 and PC7) to facilitate their activation by cleavage. In addition, furin activates several bacterial toxins, including the anthrax toxin 54, 55 and Clostridium septicum \u03b1\u2010toxin 56, making furin and related enzymes attractive targets for therapeutic intervention 37. Identification of the pro\u2010protein convertases with the highest activity for the pathogen protein in question 57 and generation of specific inhibitors are therefore important tasks 58.",

The role of these proteases in influenza virus infection has recently been reviewed 62, and will only be briefly discussed here. For some of the soluble, HA\u2010activating proteases distinct expression patterns in the respiratory epithelium have been identified, suggesting that different enzymes might activate influenza viruses in different sections of the respiratory tract 62. In addition, endogenous inhibitors of these enzymes, like secretory leukoprotease inhibitor and pulmonary surfactant, have been identified and were shown to inhibit viral replication in vitro and in experimentally infected rats 62. Although these observations suggest a role of soluble cellular proteases in influenza virus spread in the infected host, direct evidence to support this hypothesis, for instance reduced viral spread in knockout animals, is largely missing.",

Indeed, co\u2010infection of mice with a Staphylococcus aureus strain secreting an HA\u2010activating protease and an influenza virus with a monobasic cleavage site caused severe disease, while infection with bacteria or virus alone did not induce overt symptoms 64. Severe disease was also not observed when bacteria were inoculated, which did not secrete the HA\u2010activating protease, or when a virus was employed 64, which was not activated by the protease in question, indicating that the HA\u2010activation by the Staphylococcus aureus protease was the pathogenic mechanism underlying the above described observations. In summary, soluble proteases produced by both host cells and bacteria 63, 64, 66 can activate influenza virus HA.

Thus, cleavage by TMPRSS2 but not HAT was resistant to certain protease inhibitors and resistance seemed to correlate with cleavage of HA inside the cell compared to cleavage at the plasma membrane 78 (Figure 2). This finding has implications for inhibitor development (since membrane permeable inhibitors will be required to block TMPRSS2 but not HAT) and for our understanding of HA cleavage in lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, the nature of the cellular compartment(s) where TTSPs mediate HA cleavage deserves further characterisation.",

Evidence from other viruses indicates that proteolytic activation can occur even after attachment of progeny virions to target cells. The envelope proteins of Ebola virus (EBOV) and SARS\u2010coronavirus are activated by the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L 87, 88, and these enzymes constitute potential therapeutic targets. Cathepsins require low pH for their activity, and the previously reported pH\u2010dependence of EBOV and SARS\u2010coronavirus entry is due to the requirement for cathepsin activity rather than direct glycoprotein activation by low pH 87, 88. Notably, activation in target cell vesicles has also been described for influenza virus A/WSN/33 89 (Figure 2). This process was observed with MDBK but not CV\u20101 cells and was sensitive to serine\u2010 but not cysteine protease inhibitors 89, suggesting that influenza virus activation in target cells might occur in a cell\u2010type dependent fashion and is not facilitated by cathepsins. The protease(s) responsible for influenza virus activation in MDBK cells remains to be identified.

One is the frequently studied, neurovirulent 90 laboratory strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1), which was obtained by extensive passaging of the parental virus, WS/33, in different animals. The spread of WSN/33 in infected mice is not limited to brain and lung tissue but is rather systemic 91, suggesting that the virus evolved a mechanism to ensure efficient HA cleavage in a broad spectrum of cell types. Studies dating back to the 1970s demonstrated that (i) WSN/33 was activated by the serum protease plasmin 92, (ii) NA was intimately involved in HA\u2010cleavage 93 and that (iii) NA 90, specifically adequate glycosylation of NA 94, was required for neurovirulence in mice. Work by Goto and Kawaoka linked these observations by demonstrating that WSN/33 NA recruits serum plasminogen, which upon conversion to plasmin, activates HA 95, 96, 97. One of several amino acid exchanges present in WSN/33 NA but not the parental WS/33 NA was found to be crucial for HA activation: Mutation N146R (N2 numbering), which inactivated a signal for N\u2010linked glycosylation, conferred plasminogen binding to WS/33 while the reverse exchange abrogated plasminogen recruitment by WSN/33. In addition, the carboxy\u2010terminal lysine residue 453, which is conserved among NAs of the N1 subtype, was essential for plasminogen recruitment 95, 96, 97, suggesting that certain influenza virus NAs might have the intrinsic capacity to bind plasminogen, which is masked by posttranslational modification of N146 by a glycan side chain.",

Analysis of the 1918 NA revealed the presence of the lysine residue crucial for plasminogen binding but also showed the presence of the glycosylation signal incompatible with plasminogen recruitment by WSN/33 98. Notably, the 1918 virus replicated in the dog kidney cell line MDCK with high efficiency in the absence of trypsin, and trypsin\u2010independent spread was dependent on the presence of the 1918 NA 99. These results suggest that the 1918 NA also facilitates HA cleavage, at least in some cellular systems (MDCK cells), and might do so by recruiting a protease. A subsequent study demonstrated that WSN/33 NA but not 1918 NA was able to sequester plasminogen and to activate WSN/33 HA 20. Conversely, and unexpectedly, the 1918 HA but not the WSN/33 HA bound plasminogen and the biological significance of the plasminogen capture is at present unclear 20. These results argue against 1918 NA facilitating HA cleavage in a manner directly comparable to WSN/33 NA. It can be speculated, however, that 1918 NA might recruit a factor which promotes plasminogen conversion into plasmin, like annexin II, which was shown to be incorporated into influenza virus particles and to support viral replication by activating plasminogen 100. Regardless of the, at present unclear, mechanism underlying NA\u2010dependent 1918 HA cleavage, it needs to be noted that this process was not detected in the human hepatoma cell line Huh\u20107 or the human kidney\u2010derived cell line 293T 20, and is thus of uncertain relevance to 1918 virus spread in the human host. Finally, it is noteworthy that the 1918 influenza virus and a seasonal influenza virus replicated in the human lung cell line Calu\u20103 with high efficiency in the absence of trypsin 99. Cleavage of the HA proteins by TTSPs, which does not depend on NA, might have been responsible. Expression analysis and knock\u2010down studies are needed to test this hypothesis.",

The potential of combination therapy should therefore be explored, and the development of new drugs is imperative. The cellular proteases which activate HA are attractive targets for several reasons. For one, they are essential for viral spread and, as host cell\u2010encoded factors, of invariable nature. As a consequence of the latter property, viral resistance due to mutation of the drug target can be excluded. The alteration of the cleavage site in response to protease inhibition is conceivable. However, it is important to note that evolution of seasonal influenza viruses with a multibasic cleavage site, which would confer resistance to inhibitors directed against proteases recognising monobasic cleavage sites, has never been observed in humans. Another advantage of protease inhibitors is the mere fact that ample proof of concept is already available: protease inhibitors have been documented to suppress influenza virus spread in cell culture 78, in experimentally infected animals 101, 102 and, most importantly, in humans 102. Major unwanted side effects were not observed in these studies but are of concern when considering clinical development of protease inhibitors for influenza therapy. However, identifying which of the so far described HA\u2010processing proteases indeed support(s) spread of human influenza virus in infected individuals would allow the generation of highly specific inhibitors, which can be expected to be both safe and effective. The discovery of TTSPs as HA\u2010activating enzymes combined with the observation that knockout of TMPRSS2 has no phenotype in mice 103, might be the first step in this direction.",

For avian influenza viruses, a correlation between the cleavage site sequence, the nature of the HA\u2010processing proteases and the degree of viral pathogenicity has been firmly established. For human influenza viruses, a similar correlation does not exist and the paradigm on HA cleavage shifted from cleavage by soluble proteases to cleavage by cell\u2010associated proteases. Recent studies suggests that members of the TTSP family, specifically TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT, mediate cell\u2010associated HA\u2010cleavage, and future studies must define the importance of the respective enzymes. Protease inhibitors are effective as treatment for influenza 102, and TTSPs might emerge as prime targets. Finally, inhibitors of TTSPs might be of therapeutic value for conditions others than influenza, since recent evidence suggests that TTSPs are also involved in the proteolytic activation of human metapneumovirus 104 and SARS\u2010coronavirus 105, and an important role of TTSPs in several cancers is well documented 71, 74.",
