            "text": "Grass carp reovirus (GCRV), which belongs to the genus Aquareovirus of the family Reoviridae, has caused severe epidemic outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease and has an extremely high mortality rate among grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) [1]. At present, known GCRV strains can be divided into three distinct subtypes based on sequence comparisons and analysis. The representative strains of the three groups are GCRV-873 (GCRV-I), GCRV-HZ08 (GCRV-II), and GCRV-104 (GCRV-III) [2]. The most commonly isolated strain is GCRV-\u2161 [3]. GCRV is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus and the genome consists of 11 segments (termed s1\u2013s11) encased in a multilayered icosahedral capsid shell [4,5]. The protein sequence comparison showed that the similarity among the three groups is <20%, so the functions of the encoded proteins are likely diverse. For instance, s7 of GCRV-I has been found to encode a non-structural protein (NS16, NS31) [5,6]. S7 of both GCRV-II and GCRV-III are codified as a fiber like protein, which are predicted to be 56 KDa (VP56) and 55 KDa (VP55) [7,8]. In recent years, great progress has been made in the pathogenesis of GCRV and the host response to GCRV infection. For example, by using high-throughput methods such as transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, many immune-related genes have been identified as being involved in a GCRV infection [9]. Overexpression of Mxs blocks the replication of GCRV and delays the CPE induced by GCRV infection [10]. In crucian carp, viperin confers cells significant protection against GCRV infection [11].",

            "text": "Interferon (IFN) response plays an essential role in protecting the host against virus infection [12,13]. The host possesses conserved pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that can sense viral RNAs and trigger multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) pathway, which eventually results in the production of IFN to set up the antiviral state [12,[14], [15], [16]]. The specific RLR pathway is as follows: upon binding with viral RNA, the N-terminal caspase recruiting domain (CARD) of the RLR family (including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), interacts with another CARD-containing protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also called VISA, IPS-1, and Cardif) [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. Then, the signal transmits to the downstream mediator of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation (MITA, also known as STING, ERIS, or MYPS) and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) [21]. Subsequently, activated TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3/7 are translocated to the nucleus and trigger the transcription of IFN [22,23]. Similar to mammals, fish also possess a conserved RLRs signaling pathway. For example, MAVS or MITA plays an important role in IFN activation in zebrafish (Danio rerio), which can significantly decrease the probability of viral infection [24,25]. Overexpression of grass carp TBK1 induces the expression of IRF7 and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and inhibits the replication of GCRV [26]. IRF7 in zebrafish and grass carp also exhibits a critical role in IFN activation [27].",

IRF7 is a key transcription factor that regulates IFN induction in response to viral infection [28,29], most signals ultimately converge on IRF7, so it is targeted by viruses as a major negative regulatory target to decrease the IFN response and facilitate viral replication. For instance, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) utilizes the nsp 7 protein to inhibit IRF7 expression, thereby down-regulating IFN production and counteracting the host antiviral state [30]. The 3Cpro of Seneca Valley Virus (SVV) reduces IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression and phosphorylation via its protease activity, thus blocking IFN transcription to escape the host immune response [31]. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded viral interferon regulatory factor 4 (vIRF4) interacts with IRF7, resulting in the inhibition of IRF7 dimerization and ultimately suppressing IFN production [32].",

To further investigate the immune evasion strategies of GCRV, we further revealed that GCRV VP56 is associated with IRF7 and promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of IRF7, thereby inhibiting IFN expression and accelerating viral proliferation. These results will lay a foundation for further studying host-virus interactions among lower vertebrates.",

Here, to further investigate the other strategies used by GCRV to combat the host, other constructs of GCRV segments were employed for luciferase experiments in vitro, and the s7-encoded protein (VP56) exhibited the potential to inhibit host IFN activation. Upon infection with GCRV, the viral s7 gene was increased significantly in GCO cells, which indicated that the cells were successfully infected with GCRV (Fig. 1\nA). Four type I IFNs (IFN1-IFN4) have been identified in grass carp, but only IFN1 can be significantly activated by poly I:C, a mimic of viral RNA [35] (data not shown). Thus, grass carp IFN1 was used in this study. As shown in Fig. 1B, poly I:C stimulation induced the upregulation of IFN1 transcripts; however, such induction was significantly impeded by the overexpression of VP56. Moreover, VP56 also blocked the poly I:C-activated expression of isg15 (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that GCRV VP56 serves as a negative regulator to interfere with host IFN production.",

In the host IFN response, the ISRE motif is considered the binding site of ISGs that responds to transcriptional factors.

As shown in Fig. 4\nA, overexpressed VP56 did not cause any obvious change in RLR molecules at the protein level. Given that IRF3/7 phosphorylation is indispensable for mediating the IFN response, whether the phosphorylation of IRF3/7 is influenced by VP56 needs to be clarified. First, the function of grass carp TBK1 was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, both IRF3 and IRF7 caused a band shift and exhibited higher mobilities when they were co-transfected with TBK1-Flag in 293T cells. Subsequently, the cell lysates were incubated with CIP. As expected, the band shifts disappeared, demonstrating that IRF3 and IRF7 are also phosphorylated by TBK1 in grass carp. Then, we evaluated whether IRF3/7 phosphorylation would be impaired by the overexpression of VP56. As shown in Fig. 4D and E, the amount of IRF7 was dramatically reduced by the overexpression of VP56 in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, VP56 had minimal effects on the IRF3 level. Similar results occur in zebrafish (Fig. 4F and G). These results suggest that VP56 specifically promotes the degradation of IRF7.",

            "text": "Protein degradation is one of the main strategies involved in modulating protein functions in biological processes and there are two main systems for protein degradation: ubiquitin proteasome and autophagosome pathways. To identify the degradation pathway of IRF7, the cells were treated with indicated inhibitors. The VP56-mediated degradation of IRF7 was completely inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not 3-MA, which is an autophagosome pathway inhibitor (Fig. 5\nA). Since ubiquitination is an important process during proteasome-dependent degradation, we further determined whether the degradation of IRF7 was due to ubiquitination. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Flag-TBK1, Myc-IRF7, HA-VP56, and HA-Ub in the presence or absence of MG132. Following the immunoprecipitation of Myc-IRF7, IB revealed that VP56 potentiated the ubiquitination of IRF7 (Fig. 5B). K48 and K63, the lysines at positions 48 and 63 of ubiquitin linked with polyubiquitin chains, are two canonical polyubiquitin chain linkages. Given that K48-linked polyubiquitin chain modification leads to the targeting of proteins for proteasome recognition and degradation, whereas K63-linked polyubiquitin chain modification enhances the stability of target proteins [[36], [37], [38]], we chose to investigate whether VP56 promoted the K48- or K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF7. To achieve this goal, plasmids expressing ubiquitin mutants and retaining only a single lysine residue either K48 (ubiquitin-K48) or K63 (ubiquitin-K63) were used. As shown in Fig. 5C, immunoprecipitation and IB indicated that VP56 promoted IRF7 ubiquitination with wild-type ubiquitin and ubiquitin-K48 but not with ubiquitin-K63. The above results indicate that VP56 induces the K48-linked ubiquitination of IRF7, which is recognized and subsequently degraded by the proteasome pathway.",

The GCRV virion consists of 11 dsRNA genome segments surrounded by multiple concentric protein capsids [8]. The 11 segments encode seven structural proteins and five nonstructural proteins. Five of these proteins (VP1-VP4 and VP6) form the core layer [39]. The functional exploration of non-structural proteins among the 11 segments remains unclear. We have reported that VP41 prevents the fish IFN response by attenuating the phosphorylation of MITA for viral evasion [40]. Further study in this manuscript has revealed that VP56 interacts with IRF7 and promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF7. Many viruses have evolved strategies to elude the host immune system and one or several host immune molecules may be involved in this evasion because of viruses' relatively limited genome capacity [41].",

            "text": "RLRs toll-like receptor (TLR)- and NOD-like receptor (NLR)-mediated immune responses are the first line of defense against pathogenic microbes [12]. The IFN system is a particularly critical component in the host response, including the induction of IFN, IFN-mediated signaling, and the amplification of the IFN response [42]. IRF7 is a critical component of the intrinsic immune system [43]. Although various PRRs activate different signal pathways, most signals transduction ultimately converge on IRF7. In addition, IRF7 is induced by viral infection and is essential for sustained transcriptional activation of IFN genes [44]. In response to host defend mechanisms, viruses have evolved various strategies to inhibit the activation of IRF7, including inhibiting IRF7 dimerization and altering IRF7 modification (sumoylation, phosphorylation, or ubiquitination) [[45], [46], [47], [48]]. In fish, antiviral effects of IRF7 has been reported in crucian carp, zebrafish, and grass carp [49,50]. Following GCRV infection, host induces a series of antiviral immune responses, then stimulates the transcription of a broad range of ISGs including irf7, which in turn establish an antiviral state within the cells to eliminate viral infection [51]. However, viruses have established multiple mechanisms to counteract host antiviral state [52]. So far, the relationships between fish viruses and IRF7 are not well known. In the present study, GCRV VP56 induced the degradation of IRF7, resulting in the reduction of IFN expression. These results demonstrate that fish virus also possesses the function to antagonize host IFN response.",
