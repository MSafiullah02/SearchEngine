Thus a successful species requires some mechanism or mechanisms to prevent germination before, but not at, the optimum time so that the probability of encountering poor growing conditions in the period after germination is reduced (\nAngevine & Chabot 1979).",

In these environments, species need to avoid germination on small falls of rain during the dry season as mortality can be complete during subsequent dry periods (\nMcKeon 1985;\nMcKeon et al. 1985\n). Seeds then need to germinate early in the wet season as later\u2010establishing seedlings are less likely to survive competition from established perennial plants and older seedlings (\nRoss & Harper 1972;\nCook & Ratcliff 1984,\n1985). Surface soil temperatures frequently exceed 50\u00b0C during the dry season in tropical areas (\nMott 1978;\nMott et al. 1981\n;\nMcKeon et al. 1985\n) and exposure to such high temperatures is an important dormancy\u2010breaking mechanism in some tropical grasses and Stylosanthes species (\nMott 1978;\nMott et al. 1981\n;\nHacker 1984;\nHacker et al. 1984\n;\nHacker & Ratcliff 1989). Herbaceous communities can contain many more species than those assessed already, so this study was undertaken to compare the changes in dormancy and germination of seed of a wide range of native and exotic species (based on\nHenderson 1997) collected at two sites typical of the seasonally dry tropics. The seed was stored under relatively constant laboratory conditions (control), exposed on the soil surface to simulate field conditions, or kept in an oven with fluctuating temperatures similar to those found on the soil surface (25/60\u00b0C). The oven treatment approximates the temperature environment experienced by seed in the field (\nMott 1978;\nMcKeon et al. 1985\n) but excludes other effects such as wetting/drying and fungal infections. Seed size has been related to seed germination and persistence and has been used to predict seed longevity (e.g.\nGrime 1989;\nThompson et al. 1993\n;\nBekker et al. 1998\n). Germination rate may control germination in tropical areas (\nMcKeon et al. 1985\n) so relationships between seed weight and germination rate were also examined to assess the utility of seed size as a predictor.",

Optimal conditions for germination are not known for most species but 30/25\u00b0C is in the optimum range for many tropical species ( Ellis et al. 1985\n). Germinated seeds were counted and removed daily for 14 days. Any seeds which did not germinate during that period were dissected and classified as dormant if the embryo and endosperm were firm and intact, or as dead if the tissues were pulpy and had begun to decay (\nMott 1978). There was some field germination after 16 weeks and it is possible some seeds in these samples classified as dead had previously germinated. This gave four classes of seed: field\u2010germinated, germinable, dormant and dead. (For the two legumes, hard seeds were also counted separately but have been included in the dormant class.)",

Dactyloctenium radulans is an annual grass which increases under heavy stocking (\nAnderson 1993;\nRoberts & Silcock 1993) and can be a weed of cultivated areas and roadsides (\nTothill & Hacker 1983). Urochloa mosambicensis is a perennial grass sown in pastures but which is naturalized in northern Australia and can be a problem in cultivation (\nKleinschmidt & Johnson 1977). Stylosanthes hamata and S. scabra are important sown legumes in semiarid tropical areas and the high hard seed level is an important adaptation to the variable climate experienced in these areas. Gomphrena celosioides is a common weed of disturbed areas and often invades overgrazed pastures (\nKleinschmidt & Johnson 1977;\nAnderson 1993). Although all species in this group had high dormancy levels during the wet season and some may survive in the soil for a number of years (e.g. Eleusine indica;\nHawton & Drennan 1980), very few seeds of Urochloa mosambicensis and Themeda triandra exposed on the soil surface for a further 64 weeks were dormant at the end of the period.",

The low dormancy levels in the three weedy species in this group (Digitaria ciliaris, Themeda quadrivalvis and Hyptis suaveolens) is surprising although\nMarks & Nwachuku (1986) found there were few viable seeds of Digitaria ciliaris after storage in the soil for a wet season.

The sample of Heteropogon contortus collected from Katherine had lower dormancy than the Woodstock collection in both the late dry (17 vs 42%) and mid wet seasons (1 vs 17%). Such variation between collections could be expected as Heteropogon contortus is a variable species (\nTothill 1966;\nTothill & Hacker 1976) and a higher level of dormancy would be expected in a collection from an area with more variable climate (e.g. Woodstock) than one from an area with more reliable climate such as Katherine (\nMcCown 1981).",

Almost all species germinated faster after exposure on the soil surface than after storage for the same time in the laboratory.\nMcKeon (1984) found a similar result with Stylosanthes hamata, Stylosanthes humilis and Digitaria ciliaris which all germinated faster after exposure on the soil surface to rainfall. The wide range in germination rates between species means there could be large differences in establishment after small falls of rain; some species had almost complete germination within 1 day whereas others required more than 4 days to reach 50% germination. Rapid germination may particularly increase the likelihood of establishment of smaller seeds in seasonally dry environments (\nMurali 1997) and in this experiment there was a weak trend for germination rate to decline as seed size increased. Similar relationships have been found with other suites of species or genotypes from the seasonally dry tropics (\nKrishnasamy 1986;\nAgboola 1996;\nMurali 1997) but not necessarily in temperate (e.g.\nCounts & Lee 1991) or cultivated species (e.g.\nImrie 1972;\nNewell & Bludau 1993).",

This is just prior to the median start of the wet season at Townsville ( McCown 1981). For three species (Dactyloctenium radulans, Eleusine indica and Gomphrena celosioides), dormancy level did not alter during storage in the oven also, suggesting dormancy\u2010breaking is complex and not simply the result of high temperatures.\nSilcock et al. (1990)\n found virtually no germination of Dactyloctenium radulans even after 8 years\u2019 storage in a laboratory unless the seed was scarified; treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid can also increase germination of this species (\nSilcock & Williams 1975). Dormancy of Eleusine indica is decreased by gibberellic acid and potassium nitrate and can be broken by mechanical or acid scarification (\nHawton & Drennan 1980;\nKanzler & van Staden 1984). Dormancy in the other four species (two Stylosanthes species, Pennisetum pedicillatum and Sida acuta) responds to high temperatures (\nMott 1980;\nMott et al. 1981\n) and it is possible the temperatures in the field were not sufficiently high to affect them;\nMott (1980) found Pennisetum pedicillatum seed in the hotter environment at Katherine was nondormant by the end of the dry season and in this study there was a significant decline after 32 weeks in the oven.",

Removal of a species from the community for more than 1 or 2 years is likely to leave no seed available for re\u2010establishment and could result in permanent changes to the community unless the species is able to recolonize from elsewhere or is deliberately reintroduced.",

First, the dormancy and germination characteristics of the species depend on storage conditions with the changes for seeds stored on the soil surface markedly different to the changes for seeds stored in the laboratory or oven. Other authors working both with temperate ( Grime et al. 1981\n;\nBaskin & Baskin 1988;\nWashitani & Masuda 1990) and with tropical species (\nElberse & Breman 1989) have concluded that field behaviour can be related to laboratory germination and response to storage conditions. From this study, the most useful treatments will be those where the storage conditions are as similar as possible to the conditions actually experienced by seeds in the field, for example the soil storage treatment in this experiment. Second, there are a range of dormancy responses in species from these communities. This is true even within a plant type, for example all four dormancy groups were represented in the annual grasses. The major native perennial grasses had very low to low levels of dormancy after exposure on the soil surface during the dry and wet seasons but a number of weedy annual grasses and dicots (except Hyptis suaveolens) had medium to high dormancy levels at the end of the dry season which were maintained to different degrees during the following wet season. Third, provenance or seed collection site (they were confounded in this experiment) may affect seed dormancy patterns.",
