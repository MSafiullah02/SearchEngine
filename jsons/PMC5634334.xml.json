SARS-CoV first emerged in 2002 with a case fatality rate of 10%, claiming the lives of over 800 people and infecting more than 8000 [1], [2]. After 10 years, MERS-CoV emerged with a shocking case fatality rate of nearly 35% and has spread to 27 different countries to date [3]. The continuing threat of MERS-CoV was recently underscored by one of its most recent outbreaks in Republic of Korea. This outbreak quickly led to 36 deaths, which has brought the total MERS-CoV global deaths to over 600 [4], [5].",

Together, these enzymes cleave the viral polyprotein into 16 different nonstructural proteins (Nsps 1\u201316) in order to generate the membrane-bound replicase complex for RNA replication [6], [7], [8], [9]. CoVs encode either a single PLP, termed PLpro, or two PLPs that process a total of three cleavage sites within the polyprotein [7], [10]. For instance, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encode a single PLpro, while other CoVs such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) encode for both the PLP1 and PLP2 (Fig. 1a).",

            "text": "Beyond cleaving the viral polyprotein, PLPs have additional activities that promote virus replication. The X-ray structure of the first CoV PLP determined from SARS revealed that these enzymes resemble the structure of human ubiquitin (Ub)-specific proteases (USPs) and are thereby known as viral USPs, often acting as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) with the ability to remove the post-translational modification Ub from target proteins [8]. Some PLPs are also deISGylating enzymes with the ability to reverse the post-translational modification of the Ub-like (Ubl) protein interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins [11]. Such activities were implicated in SARS-CoV's suppression of the innate immune responses, particularly antagonizing type-I interferon (IFN) signaling and chemokine and cytokine production [12], [13]. Simultaneous disruption of both activities, either by mutation in MERS CoV PLpro's Ub/Ubl binding region [14] or by a destabilizing mutation in MHV PLP's Ubl domain [10], has been observed to prevent the antagonization of IFN signaling, chemokine and cytokine production, and viral pathogenesis, respectively. Overall, these studies suggest that the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of PLPs, sometimes packaged together as DUB activity, are a likely contributor to viral pathogenesis.",

So far, several X-ray structures of PLpro and PLP2 bound with Ub molecules have been reported [8], [15], [16]. However, no structure of any CoV PLP in complex with an ISG15 molecule has yet been reported. Due to the lack of structural detail about the interface between CoV PLPs and ISG15, understanding how CoVs' PLPs specifically engage with ISG15s versus Ub has been especially difficult to understand. The lack of structural information has led to problems in defining the differences between CoV PLPs' deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities among different CoVs. A further complication in our understanding stems from the fact that the sequence identity of ISG15 among mammals is low, ranging from 58% to as low as 35% when a broader range of animals is compared (Fig. 1b). In contrast, Ub is highly conserved among eukaryotes.",

            "text": "The sequence diversity of ISG15 among animals and the impact of this diversity on the recognition of these ISG15s by viral USPs have not been well studied despite the potential implications. For example, certain CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are known to replicate and survive in a broad range of animals including bats, camels, mice, civets, shrews, badgers, pigs, and humans [10], [17], [18]. In contrast, other CoVs such as MHV only replicate in mice, suggesting that some CoV PLPs may have evolved strict specificity for their single host's ISG15 [19]. The potential for species\u2013species variances in ISG15 has already been shown to be a key factor in other viruses including influenza B where it was shown that NS1 is unable to bind mouse ISG15 (mISG15) unlike its non-human primate and human counterparts, limiting influenza B virus infection in mice [20], [21], [22]. Also, biodiversity that occurs between species within ISG15s was recently shown to impact the ability of nairovirus viral ovarian tumor domain proteases (vOTUs) to effectively process certain ISG15s [23]. Overall, many CoV PLPs have been observed to show robust deubiquitinating activities; [11], [24] however, recent in vivo studies have started to unveil the importance of PLPs deISGylating activity [25], [26]. This has led to a need for a better and more detailed understanding of the interactions between CoV PLPs and ISG15 at the molecular level.",

This is especially important when the intramolecular arrangement of the two domains of ISG15 is considered. For example, the hinge region of ISG15 shows a significant degree of sequence diversity between the different species (Fig. 1b). Although several structures of human ISG15 (hISG15) have been reported, no complete structure of ISG15 from another species has been resolved. Moreover, the recent elucidation of the structure of the C-terminal domain portion of mISG15 prompted questions on the impact of ISG15 biodiversity on the overall ISG15 structural fold [23].",

Differences in cleaving ability of proISG15s by SARS and MERS PLpro may be due to sequence and structural differences, which may affect binding affinities for the ISG15s. This possibility was explored using ITC to measure the binding affinities of different ISG15s missing the P\u2032-sites (Fig. 3\n). As deISGylases natural substrates include an isopetide bond, removal of the P\u2032-sites also allows the avoidance of potential confounding factors related to CoV PLPs' other prominent function of processing the viral polyprotein to promote viral replication. This part of the process requires that PLPs recognize and cleave the peptide bond after the LXGG sequences within the polyprotein, and the ability of PLPs to cleave this bond has been shown to be reliant on residues flanking the peptide cleavage site [6], [9]. This requisite function is not associated with other viral deISGylating proteases such as nairovirus vOTUs [23]. Therefore, ITC measurements were performed using mature ISG15. Although the mature ISG15s resemble the product by the absence of an isopetide bond, binding affinity could be assessed independent of any P\u2032-sites contribution associated with using the ISG15-pro-form protein. This would also provide a more quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic parameters related solely to the species and virus-related variances of the protease and ISG15s, respectively.",

Although there is only a minor variation surrounding a 180\u00b0 flip of Trp123 between the two copies of ChISG15 in the asymmetric unit, both ChISG15 chains are analogous in how they are accommodated by SARS-CoV PLpro compared to Ub (Fig. 4e). The differences appear to be driven by how hISG15 and Ub differ in their ability to interact with a hydrophobic region consisting of residues Arg167, Met209, and Pro248. For Ub, the interactions with this region occur by means of a hydrophobic patch consisting of Ile44, Val70, and Leu8 [15]. In contrast, ISG15 lacks such a hydrophobic patch. The interaction is primarily driven by two distinct sets of hydrophobic interactions: hISG15's Trp123 with Met209 of the protease's palm region, and hISG15's Phe149 with a second hydrophobic site driven by Pro224 of the protease's fingers region (Fig. 4c and d). This predominate hydrophobic binding nature was also seen in the ITC results of SARS-CoV with ChSIG15, with an observed increase in entropic favorable interactions when compared with the hISG15 (Table 2). Surprisingly, while the Ub-bound structure contains other polar and water-mediated interactions between Ub and the palm region of the PLpro, such interactions seem to be less pronounced in the more charged ChISG15 structure [15]. Overall, there are only a few water molecules present within the interface between PLpro and ChISG15 compared to the larger number that is observed in the Ub-bound structure, potentially indicating a lesser role of water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions in the binding of hISG15.",

From a structural prospective, the reduction of Ub-AMC activity is not surprising as M209A shrinks the hydrophobic patch that engages the Ile44-centered hydrophobic patch in Ub. The observed increase of the activity toward Z-RLRGG-AMC is less straightforward. M209 lacks direct interaction with the last 5 aa of Ub or ISG15. However, its replacement by alanine could sterically open up a space that is more accommodating for the artificial Z-adduct of the peptide. The other two mutants were found to have increased catalytic efficiencies for processing either Ub or ISG15 with a corresponding reduction in activity for the other. R167E is over 8 times more efficient than the wild-type enzyme at hydrolyzing Ub but is about 20 times less efficient at hydrolyzing ISG15 (Fig. 5c). In contrast, Q233E is nearly threefold more efficient than wild-type at hydrolyzing ISG15 and twofold less efficient at hydrolyzing Ub. In the case of Ub, the mono-Ub structure suggests that the charge flip with R167E may introduce an additional electrostatic interaction with either Arg42 or Gln49 of Ub. For the ChISG15 structure, this change occurs in close proximity to the interaction between Trp123 and Met209. Examination of the structure reveals that Arg167 may contribute to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions involving Trp123 and Arg153 of ChISG15 (Figs. 4e and 5a). Replacing the longer and positively charged arginine with the shorter glutamate removes this contribution. Additionally, this charge flip may disrupt the electrostatic interaction between Arg153 and Glu168 of the PLpro, potentially resulting in a loss of affinity for ChISG15. For Q233E, the change from a neutral polar to a charged group may create a potential electrostatic repulsion with the backbone carbonyl of Ala46 in Ub (Fig. 5b). For the ChISG15 structure, in comparison, there is not a clear direct interaction between PLpro and ISG15 that would be affected. This suggests that the impact of this mutation may stem from internal changes within the PLpro regarding the flexibility of the finger region rather than direct interactions with the substrate.",

To this end, a structure of SARS-CoV PLpro with CmISG15 was determined to a resolution of 2.4 \u00c5 (Fig. 6a). The structure of the catalytic core domain of SARS-CoV PLpro is consistent with the structure of the ChISG15 SARS-CoV PLpro structure. However, a major difference in the orientation of the Ubl domain of SARS-CoV PLpro is observed when bound to CmISG15. Unlike previous SARS-CoV PLpro structures where the Ubl domains differ only slightly in its position/orientation to the catalytic domain or are unobservable because of weak electron density, suggesting potential flexibility, the Ubl in the SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013CmISG15 structure takes a sharp, almost 90\u00b0 turn in orientation when compared with previous X-ray structures (Fig. 6c). The new orientation does not appear to form contacts with the bound CmISG15, suggesting that there is no direct influence on the Ubl domain to adopt this conformation. Further analysis of the new orientation reveals a seam made up of several electrostatic interactions between the Ubl domain and the thumb domains of the PLpro, indicating that this orientation can be stabilized (Fig. 6b).",

Surprisingly, the global orientation of CmISG15 is tilted 27\u00b0 away from the fingers in SARS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 6d). Interestingly, 4 aa appear to explain the lack of CmISG15's accommodation in the same orientation to that of bound ChISG15. At position 149 in ChISG15 and 147 in CmISG15, there is an amino acid difference of a phenylalanine and an isoleucine, respectively (Fig. 6e). This change in CmISG15 eliminates the hydrophobic interaction with the finger region of SARS-CoV PLpro seen in the ChISG15-bound structure and likely aids in the tilt toward the Ubl domain. In addition, there is a change from Asn89, Thr125, and Asn151 in ChISG15 to Glu87, Ser123, and His149 in CmISG15 (Fig. 6f). These amino acid differences create a hydrogen bond network among Glu87, His149, and Ser123 in the CmISG15, which is absent in the ChISG15-bound structure. This network locks the Glu87 into an unfavorable position for CmISG15 to bind in the same manner as ChISG15. The unfavorable position ultimately results in the repulsion of CmISG15 against PLpro.",

Consistent with the X-ray structures of other deISGylases bound to the C-terminal domain of hISG15 [27], [28], the conserved Trp121 of mISG15 is centric to the interface. However, unlike the interaction observed in the SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013ChISG15 structure, Trp121 in the mISG15 does not insert into a hydrophobic pocket. Instead, mISG15's Trp121 and Pro128 form significantly smaller hydrophobic interaction with SARS-CoV PLpro via the proteses' extended alkyl chain of Glu168 generated by the hydrogen bond formed between it and Thr171. In contrast to the bound ChISG15 and outside the last five C terminus consensus amino acids of Ub and ISG15, this weak hydrophobic interaction between CmISG15 and the protease is the only one observed. In addition to the hydrophobic binding contributions of mISG15 Trp121, a water molecule is observed to mediate a hydrogen-bonding network between Trp121's indole nitrogen and several nearby PLpro residues (Fig. 6g and h). Including this hydrogen bond network, CmISG15 forms almost 40% more hydrogen bonds with the protease that is then observed with ChISG15. One set of these additional electrostatic interactions are centered on SARS-CoV PLpro's Arg83 and CmISG15's Lys132. Others are also observed to form between SARS-CoV PLpro's Asn157, Gln175, and Arg167 and CmISG15's Glu130, the carbonyl of Gly126, and His149, respectively (Fig. 6g and h).",

In line with this, a greater number of water molecules, approximately 10, can be observed within the interface, further indicating the degree to which binding may be driven by more hydrophilic interactions. This characterization of the binding interaction is consistent with the thermodynamic properties observed for the binding of CmISG15 to SARS-CoV PLpro (Table 2\n). Also, when viewed in conjunction with the affinity data of mISG15 and hISG15 and their C-terminal domain counterparts, it suggests that the type of interface formed between CmISG15 and SARS-CoV PLpro is less stable than its ChISG15 counterpart and may be one of the contributing factors to the overall reduction in binding affinity observed for full-length mISG15 when compared to hISG15 via ITC.",

With only the full-length hISG15 structure available, the impact of ISG15 biodiversity within the N-terminal region has been difficult to assess. To address this issue, we determined the X-ray structure of mISG15 with both domains to assess the conformational variability of mISG15 compared to hISG15. Initially, only a low-resolution (4 \u00c5) structure could be determined. Truncation of the last non-structured 5 aa led to a structure that could be determined to a higher resolution of 3.25 \u00c5. Using the program Define Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP), the secondary structure of mISG15 was determined to be comparable to hISG15. mISG15 contains nine beta sheets, two helices, but only two 310 helices within the C-terminal domain; this differs from the hISG15 that contains two 310 helices per domain of ISG15 (Fig. 7a) [29]. The asymmetric unit consists of 2 twisting filaments, containing 10 copies of mISG15. Upon examining the differences between the monomers within the asymmetric unit, some flexibility between N- and C-terminal domains was observed (Fig. 7b and c). This flexibility was probed by aligning the C-terminal domains of each mISG15 monomer and measuring the angle between the point of divergence and the farthest N termini. There is a 20.2\u00b0 range of motion between the N- and C-terminal domains of mISG15 (Fig. 7b). Comparable flexibility was also observed in hISG15 structures, with an 18.3\u00b0 range of motion (Fig. 7c; PDB entries: 1Z2M, 3R66, 3PSE) [27], [29], [30].",

Specifically, the twist about the C- and N-terminal domain of mISG15 in relation to hISG15 ranges from 43.0\u00b0 to 66.9\u00b0 (Fig. 8a). Closer investigation reveals that differences in tertiary arrangement can be attributed to several molecular interactions within the structures driven by the primary sequence differences of mISG15 compared to hISG15. Specifically, the presence of Asp79 creates a kink in the hinge region of hISG15 as a result of the carboxylate group of Asp79 forming a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Thr101 (Fig. 8b). This interaction does not occur in mISG15 since Ser77 replaces Asp79.",

However, the four structures of hISG15 alone, or bound to viral proteins, suggest the opposite (Fig. 7c) [27], [28], [29], [30]. Akin to polymeric Ub, ISG15 appears to have relatively limited conformations between the two domains.

The highly conserved nature of this phenylalanine and other surrounding residues suggests that ISG15s in general likely utilize hydrophobic forces to adhere the two domains together (Fig. 1b, residues involved are boxed in blue). However, as shown with mISG15, the influence of the core on the orientation of the domains can vary. In mISG15, residues forming the core solely dictate its interdomain orientation, whereas in hISG15, additional electrostatic interactions involving Glu139 and His39, and to a lesser extent Thr101 and Asp79, appear to play an additional role to favor one orientation over another (Fig. 8b and c). Intriguingly, the pairing of Glu139 and His39 is extremely unique to hISG15. Although Glu139 or another acidic residue is well conserved at that position, His39 is typically a proline. In hISG15, it appears that this favorable electrostatic interaction may promote hISG15's domain orientations. Multiple crystal structures reveal this conformation to be consistent despite differences in space groups and crystallization conditions, suggesting that the observed tertiary structure is a stable and likely preferred conformation (Fig. 7c). In addition to favoring hISG15's conformation, His39 may also act as a steric block preventing hISG15 from adopting a similar tertiary structure and conformation as that of mISG15.",

The absence of such a comparable patch in ISG15 and the more generally charged surface of hISG15 naturally spurred speculation on mechanisms behind how PLPs may engage ISG15s. The SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013ChISG15 complex reveals that in PLPs, the binding interface may have evolved to recognize specific features of ISG15s from different species outside the 5-aa C-terminal sequence (Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly) they share with Ub. For hISG15, this includes not only the highly conserved Trp123 of ISG15s but also the specific interactions that are unique to hISG15. For instance, Arg87 in hISG15 is often substituted for a lysine residue that is too short to form any water-mediated interactions with the SARS-CoV PLpro's Asp230 and Ser222. Interestingly, Phe149, which forms a second hydrophobic interaction site with the protease's Pro224, is one of the 3 aa recently implicated in species specificity among nairovirus vOTUs [23]. Residue changes between hISG15 and mISG15 at the other two positions, Asn151 and Asn89, appear to impede the accommodation of mISG15 in the active site of SARS-CoV PLpro compared to the more favorable hISG15 orientation. This appears to advocate that differences at these three ISG15 positions have a broader range of influence beyond only one class of viral proteases and could conceivable represent an evolutionary pressure that underlies a part of ISG15 sequence diversity. Also, SARS-CoV residues that interact with these residues and SARS-CoV PLpro deubiquitinating and deISGylating altering mutants, R167E, M209A, and Q233E, may offer advantageous starting points for developing SARS-CoV PLpros with directed shifts in substrate specificities.",

            "text": "Beyond the C-terminal domains' interaction with PLPs, the N terminus of hISG15 has been previously proposed to interact with a ridge helix spanning the conical PLP thumb domain with the Ubl domain to enhance affinity. Currently, no X-ray structures of a PLP with full-length ISG15 exist, and previous computational models utilizing existing SARS-CoV PLpro structures bound with mono-Ub have had difficulty reconciling the significant gap that occurs between hISG15's N-terminal domain and the protease when anchoring C-terminal hISG15 domain on bound Ub. The SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013CxISG15 structures offer two synergistic explanations. First, the 6.3-\u00c5 shift of ChISG15 relative to bound Ub translates the N-terminal domain toward the ridge helix (Fig. 9a). In addition, the alternate Ubl conformation found in the SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013CmISG15 structure reveals that such a conformation translates the ridge helix up to 14 \u00c5 toward the location of the ridge helix (Fig. 9b and c). Interestingly, comparing this model to the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV PLpro bound to K48-linked di-Ub highlights that different facets of the Ubl fold found in the N-terminal domain ISG15 are likely involved in the interaction (Fig. 9d). Specifically, in this model, a triple serine repeat, Ser20\u201322, and Glu27 located in hISG15's \u03b22\u03b13 loop and \u03b13, respectively, point toward the protease's ridge helix, creating a surface that is available to be engaged by the bevy of charged and polar residues located on SAR-CoV PLpro's ridge helix that has been previously implicated in binding [15]. These potential electrostatic interactions may contribute to the four-times-larger enthalpy binding component observed in the interaction of full-length over the C-terminal domain of hISG15 when being accommodated by SARS-CoV PLpro. The impact of mISG15's divergent domain orientation from hISG15 is also apparent. Initial molecular modeling of the hISG15 structure onto the CmISG15-bound SARS-CoV PLpro structure with CmISG15 as an anchor reveals a steric clash with the ridge helix. This is the same for hISG15 drawn from any of its known X-ray structures. However, the divergent interdomain orientation found in full-length mISG15 structure determined here allows for the mISG15's N-terminal domain to fit unobstructed (Fig. 9e). The significant domain\u2013domain orientation differences between hISG15 and mISG15 result in a different facet of mISG15 facing the protease. Specifically, mISG15's \u03b11\u03b23 loop comprises the surface oriented toward the ridge helix presenting a polar interface that ITC suggests may be involved in forming additional electrostatic interactions beyond those of the C-terminal domain. However, when comparing the ITC data for full-length and its CmISG15 counterpart, these additional interactions might potentially come at an ethalpic cost. This may suggest that different ISG15 N-terminal domains may engage the protease's ridge helix to differing degrees and thermodynamic characteristics. The need for PLPs to accommodate not only surface differences between species ISG15s but also divergent interdomain orientations highlights the difficulties for a CoV PLP to be active to all species ISG15s. This could also be perceived as a possible benefit to ISG15's unique tandem Ubl arrangement. Also, the improved structural perspective on how the N terminus of ISG15s from different species may engage CoV PLPs provides a clearer path toward utilizing this region to influence the deIGylating activities of CoV PLPs. As a result, combining this information along with the alterations possible in the C-terminal domain, we can envision fresh tools to address the role of deubiquitination and deISGylation through the use of reverse genetics systems.",

Intriguingly, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros, whose viruses replicate in a wide range of hosts, recognize and cleave proISG15 from almost all of the species tested. In contrast, the mouse-specific MHV PLP2 is limited predominantly to the mouse substrate. This wider range of specificities appears substantially larger than that found recently in nairovirus vOTUs. This may imply that with the greater binding interface provided by the palm, fingers, and thumb domains of the USP fold, CoV PLPs can either engage a wider array of ISG15s than that of vOTUs or be highly selective for just one or two ISG15s as in the case of MHV.",

Understandably, this could be a by-product in the evolutionary process of a specific viral protease seeking to optimize toward a certain species ISG15 and inadvertently picking up enzymatic activity toward another ISG15; or, in an environment where a virus only has to optimize its replication in one species, there is less selective pressure and hence a greater chance of losing the ability of recognizing ISG15s from other species. Alternatively, some of these types of off-species PLP activities could be indicative of evolutionary memory for ISG15s. In essence, this could give a possible view into the zoonotic evolutionary history or potential future zoonotic drift for a certain virus. Naturally, a wider sampling of CoV PLPs' affinities for certain species ISG15s, knowledge of what species their parent viruses infect, and a multitude of reverse genetics experiments will be necessary to discern which of the above scenarios take place in the evolution of virus recognition of host ISG15s.",

The change in the relative fluorescence as a function of time (RFU/min) was monitored over a sufficient time period to allow the determination of the enzymatic rate in the steady-state region. For the ISG15-AMC assay, the substrate concentrations were varied from 0.2 \u03bcM up to 19.2 \u03bcM. The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme with the final enzyme concentrations as follows: 0.48 nM WT, 0.23 nM Q233E, 0.23 nM M209A, or 7.3 nM R167E. For the Ub-AMC assay, substrate concentrations were varied from 0.5 \u03bcM to 17.6 \u03bcM. The final enzyme concentrations were 3.7 nM WT, 7.3 nM Q233E, 7.3 nM M209A, or 0.23 nM R167E.

As such, the kinetic response of the enzyme to these substrates was linear, and thus, the data were fit to a line to approximate the catalytic efficiency (k\ncat/K\nm) for each enzyme. For the ISG15-AMC assays, the data were fit to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation to determine the associated kinetic parameters (k\ncat, K\nm, and k\ncat/K\nm) for each enzyme [24]. Saturation was not attained with the R167E mutant enzyme for ISG15-AMC, and therefore, these kinetic data were also fit to a line to determine the apparent k\ncat/K\nm.

The final SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013ChISG15 crystals were obtained through vapor diffusion using a 500-\u03bcL reservoir with 4-\u03bcL hanging drops mixed (1:1) with protein solution (6.99 mg/mL) and reservoir solution [0.1 M lithium sulfate, 0.1 M bis-Tris, (pH 6.5), and 22% PEG3350], which also contained 0.25 \u03bcl of 30% (vol/vol) glycerol. For mISG15, the initial screen yielded the best crystals in a solution containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M trisodium citrate (pH 5.6), and 15% (wt/vol) PEG4000. This condition was further optimized along buffer, pH, and PEG4000 gradients in addition to using the Additive Screen from Hampton Research. In conjunction with using these optimization methods, the mISG15 was shorted by 5 aa. The final crystals of the 5-aa-shortened mISG15 were obtained through vapor diffusion using a 500-\u03bcL reservoir with 4-\u03bcL hanging drops mixed (1:1) with protein solution (6.9 mg/mL) and reservoir solution [0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 12% PEG4000, and 0.2 M sodium malonate].",

Subsequently, each structure was rebuilt initially using Autobuild [37] followed by successive rounds of manual model building and refinement using Coot [38] and Phenix [39]. The initial solution for the SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013CmISG15 complex was achieved by using the catalytic core of a previous SARS-CoV PLpro structure (PDB entry: 3E9S). Density from the last 10 aa of the CmISG15 molecule served as an anchor for the initial global placement of the CmISG15 from a Erve nairovirus vOTU-CmISG15 complex (PDB entry: 5JZE). This partial model was then used as a search model along with the Ubl SARS-CoV PLpro domain from PDB entry: 4MM3 to obtain a complete global model using Phaser [36]. For the SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013ChISG15 complex, an initial molecular replacement solution was obtained by using the core and other elements from the SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013CmISG15 as a search model. A partial molecular replacement solution using Phaser [36] for mISG15 was obtained by searching with the CmISG15 from the Erve nairovirus vOTU\u2013CmISG15 complex structure (PDB entry: 5JZE). This partial model was used in a sequential Phaser [36] run using a mISG15 N-terminal domain homology model based on the previously solved hISG15 structure (PDB entry: 1Z2M). All structures were validated using Molprobity [40] and have good Ramachandran statistics: SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013CmISG15 (96% favored and 4% allowed), SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013ChISG15 (96% favored and 4% allowed), and mISG15 (99.08% favored and 0.92% allowed).
