We collected data from outpatient healthcare visits between January 1, 2020, and Mar 31, 2020 as well as historical data during the same period of 2019 from the Children\u2019s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. This children\u2019s hospital, with more than 1900 beds, is the largest comprehensive pediatric medical center in Zhejiang Province and the Chinese National Clinical Research Centre of Child Health. We calculated the rate of each disease in all visiting before and after Jan 25, 2020, and using the change rate (CR = rate in all visiting after outbreak / rate in all visiting before outbreak) and daily visiting number before and after outbreak (DVNbefore and DVNafter) to show changes of children\u2019s health during the pandemic under rigorous epidemic control measures. CR=1 means that the diseases do not changed after the COVID-19 outbreak; CR < 1 means the diseases were suppressed or inhibited during the pandemic; CR > 1means the diseases were stimulated or relative not inhibited during the pandemic. We use the CR< 0.5 to identify inhibited diseases and use CR> 3 to identify stimulated diseases. We also using the daily visiting number before outbreak >3 to filter inhibited diseases and total visiting number after outbreak >120 to filter stimulated diseases to exclude the effects of rare sporadic diseases.",

As shown in Figure 2, A, most decreases in visitations were for other infectious diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (CR=0.07, DVNbefore=4.08, DVNafter=0.08), influenza (CR=0.12, DVNbefore=494.38, DVNafter=15.95), infectious diarrhea (CR=0.12, DVNbefore=9.00, DVNafter=0.29), rotavirus enteritis (CR=0.19, DVNbefore=22.50, DVNafter=1.14) and hand foot mouth disease (CR=0.24, DVNbefore=3.08, DVNafter=0.20).",

Most of common infectious diseases were also suppressed during the periods due to measures as expected. The potential explanation for increased visits by adolescents may be weight gain due to longtime home quarantine and lack of exercise during this period. The high rate of atopic dermatitis and related skin conditions may be related to the lack of sunlight exposure and decreased vitamin D levels during the longtime home quarantine.",

There are also some changed conditions such as Leukemia (CR=3.98, DVNbefore=11.38, DVNafter=11.94 ) can be partially explained by this reason and the culture that patients do not want to accept risk treatments before spring festival.
