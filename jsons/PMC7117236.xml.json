While it is not as yet known what triggers FIP to develop within a particular individual, a relatively new theory suggests that, within an already immune-compromised individual, the development of extensive viral quasispecies may overwhelm the immune system, allowing FIP to develop (Horzinek et al., 1995, Horzinek, 1997). The aim of this study was to determine whether FCoV infection involved the generation of quasispecies, and if quasispecies did exist, to determine what role they may play in the development of FIP.",

Positive and negative controls were incorporated in each set of reactions. The PCR protocol consisted of an initial incubation of 94\u00b0C (10 min), followed by 35 cycles of melting 94\u00b0C (1 min), annealing 55\u00b0C (1 min) and extension 72\u00b0C (2 min), then a final extension of 72\u00b0C (10 min). PCR products were Southern blotted and hybridised with specific probes to ensure that the RT-PCR assay produced only specific products which ran on agarose gels as a single band (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998). The presence of quasispecies within the PCR products was assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), then constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE), using the denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis system (DGENE, BioRad), according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The acrylamide gels were stained with silver stain. Experiments were run in duplicate to ensure repeatability.",

A number of cell culture-adapted strains of FCoV were available (n\n = 8), and blood was collected from healthy cats living within households with endemic FCoV (n\n = 34), and cats with clinical FIP (n\n = 20). To assess how quasispecies changed on ex vivo culture a number of samples were assessed both prior to culture and after variable periods of culture in different cell types (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998). Quasispecies were demonstrated within FCoV extracted directly from blood. They were also evident when field-strain viruses were grown in cell culture, and although they showed some degree of simplification over time, they maintained complex patterns, irrespective of whether they were grown in heterogeneous or homogeneous cell lines (data not shown). Quasispecies were also found in cell-culture adapted FCoV, and even in biological clones generated by serial dilution (Fig. 1\n).",

From the current study the exact relevance of these factors remains unclear. Little difference was found in the quasispecies patterns according to age, while the majority of cats with FIP demonstrated rather limited viral variation. The diversity of exposure appeared to correlate with increased viral heterogeneity, since kittens from mixed-source households showed the most marked variability, possibly representing co-infection with a number of different FCoVs.",
