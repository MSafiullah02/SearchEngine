This dramatic change comes with a number of educational challenges for all labour market stakeholders (e.g. educational decision makers, employers, and employees). The gap, for instance, between skill demands and educational programs [2] , [3] is eminent. Moreover, the existence of transparent information on skill requirements should be a deep concern of our current societies and citizens alike. This information has significant importance to those, who want to secure long term employability, achieve promotions in their current workplace [1] , [4] , or, in the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, to those, who need to re-skill themselves to adapt to post COVID-19 labour markets (and regain employment). In order to supply stakeholders with labour market information, a number of occupational taxonomies (e.g. ESCO, O*NET) exists to provide information to job-holders and job-seekers about occupations. However, most of these taxonomies are manually maintained, therefore they are time-consuming, expensive and also susceptible to being outdated [5] .",

Open Educational Resources (OERs), especially videos, as content sources have become popular for learners [7] . They are supplied by large amount of experts around the world, with different levels of expertise in a wide range of professional contexts (e.g. discipline, location or language). However, the uptake of OERs is limited in most user groups (e.g. educators or learners) [7] - [11] , as OER repositories still struggle to provide personalised services for their users. As an illustration, if a learner wants to find appropriate learning content, (s)he must search manually through several OER repositories with different interfaces. Furthermore, the few OER recommendation algorithms available are limited to approaches such as building (or reusing existing) ontologies [12] , [13] , analysing user behavior in social networks [14] , or applying text mining techniques to identify similar OER documents [15] .",

We used online job vacancies and built a model to extract skills for jobs dynamically and avoid any dependency on existing taxonomies (which are susceptible to outdating). To build such a model, we used a crawled sample dataset from Monster.com containing 22,000 job vacancies 1 . After an exploratory analysis, we concluded that large number of vacancies do not contain a \"Required Skills\" section. Therefore, we selected vacancies explicitly containing a \"Required Skills\" section and used them to build a classification model to detect sentences, which define skill requirements. To build the model, at first, we run the following pre-processing procedure:",

We apply the described method to obtain a vector representation for both video transcription and skill description. Finally, the text similarity is a cosine similarity between the resulting two vectors. 70% of the data was used to train the model and the remaining 30% was used for the evaluation. The classifier achieves F1 score of 86.3% in predicting whether a video matches a skill. Additionally, we analysed the importance of each feature for the classification task. The trained model assigned different importance score to each feature on the basis of the provided training data. Each feature has a different weight on the decision based on these scores. The weights are calculated by pruning out trees below a particular node (as feature selection). The weights for the selected features are calculated as follows: length: 0.61, rating: 0.10, view count: 0.10, relevancy score: 0.08, level: 0.2, text similarity: 0.09.
