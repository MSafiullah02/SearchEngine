However, in 2014\u20132016, EVD spread throughout West Africa (predominantly Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), fueled in part by a fragile pre-existing health system and lack of human resource capacity, and led to the world\u2019s largest outbreak (28,610 cases with 11,308 deaths and a case fatality ratio of 39%) [13]. Since the West African outbreak, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has faced three more EVD outbreaks.

Its viral glycoprotein enhances receptor binding and attachment to the endosomes of cells [23]. The virus attacks dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, which then migrate to the lymph nodes where early viral replication and dissemination occurs before the onset of symptoms. Ebola virus disseminates to infect a broad range of cells including endothelial cells, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and the adreno-cortical cells, among others. Ebola virus uses its structural and membrane proteins through a number of mechanisms to evade the host immune response [23, 25, 26]. Tissue damage happens via numerous but closely related mechanisms such as direct viral cytopathy, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disruption, and likely, the host\u2019s own inflammatory response [23]. Infected patients undergo a cell-mediated immune activation, however, patients that succumb to EVD may have a more limited functional T-cell-mediated response [4, 27].",

For screening suspected EVD patients in remote settings without access to PCR testing, WHO recommends use of highly sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Table 2 outlines various RDTs available, with only a few, such as ReEBOV, Ebola eZYSCREEN and OraQuick, having undergone clinical validation [35, 37\u201340]. Laboratory testing for alternative or co-infections such as malaria and bacterial infections should be considered [8, 12, 23, 31], since these are often assumed to co-exist with Ebola in severely ill patients and may lead to over-prescription of antimalarials or antibiotics unless rapid tests (for malaria) and cultures (for bacterial infections) can rule these out.",

A buddy (two person) system while providing care, and PPE adherence supervisors are both advisable. Vaccination of frontline HWs should be a standard of clinical practice [16, 42].",

Basic supportive care recommendations [11] include: systematic monitoring and documentation of clinical signs and symptoms; a clinician to patient ratio of 1:4 but with emphasis placed on maximizing patient contact time; patient\u2013family audio-visual communication; psychosocial care; provision of oral rehydration therapy to correct or prevent hypovolemia; parenteral fluids for patients unable to achieve sufficient enteral hydration; measurement of serum biochemistry with correction of identified electrolyte abnormalities; oxygen administration to achieve normal oxygen saturation; intravenous vasoactive medications for patients with fluid-resistant hypotension and organ hypoperfusion; pain management, antiemetics, and anxiolytics; nutritional support customized to patient assessment including treatment of hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose when necessary; and microbiological analysis to guide antimicrobial use, and in absence of such capacity, a low threshold for empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials, depending on the geographical context and symptoms [9\u201312, 14, 44, 45]. Provision of supportive care to patients will inevitably require a multi-disciplinary team of HWs: nurses, physicians, IPC personnel, laboratory personnel, and ideally, nutritionists, social and community workers, and psychologists. These recommendations derived from observational studies that generally found improved outcomes later in the outbreak compared to the beginning, attributed to improvements in multiple domains of care, including clinical monitoring and fluid administration [46].",

Interventions include careful monitoring of urine output, maintaining adequate renal perfusion with fluids and vasoactive agents, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs and diuretics in hypovolemic patients, and treatment of other underlying cause(s) [10\u201312, 16]. Electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia have commonly been reported in the context of Ebola-related renal injury. Temporizing measures for complications of acute kidney injury should be available, such as bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, intravenous short-acting insulin and dextrose for hyperkalemia, and a diuretic trial in oliguric volume-replete patients. Where facilities and expertise are available, renal replacement therapy should be offered [11, 12, 16], as feasibility of delivering dialysis has been demonstrated in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings [12, 16, 47].",

The trial was stopped early after MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were found to be superior to ZMapp in reducing 28-day mortality, with event rates of 35.1% for MAb114 [risk difference (RD) vs. ZMapp, \u2212 14.6%, 95% CI \u2212 25.2 to \u2212 1.7%) and 33.5% for REGN-EB3 (RD vs. ZMapp, 17.8%, 95% CI \u2212 28.9 to \u2212 2.9%). Mortality among patients receiving ZMapp was 49.7% and among those receiving remdesivir was 53.1%. However, mortality rates in patients with high viral loads or those with organ dysfunction (high creatinine or transaminases) remained high (> 60% for all interventions), even in a trial setting of optimized standard of care. This observation validates the need for advanced supportive interventions tailored to patient-specific critical care needs whenever feasible, and continued research into refining more effective anti-Ebola therapeutics, either newer drug compounds or combinations of the current ones [52].",
