Wang et al. 2 reported 124 patients (89.9%) in China who received antiviral therapy with oseltamivir, and 36 of these patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 6 died (4.3%). Holshue et al. 3 presented the first case to receive intravenous remdesivir in the United States, and the outcome was satisfactory. Lopinavir and ritonavir were associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with SARS in a non-randomized open-label trial. 4 Here, we report five confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan; two were prescribed LPV/r as two tablets twice daily for empirical therapy, and three were not prescribed LPV/r. We describe their diagnosis, clinical course, and novel coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) viral loads during the treatment course.",

            "text": "Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that was shown to act at both entry and post-entry stages of SARS CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. 7 Chloroquine is an immunemodifier that can be distributed throughout the body, including the lungs. Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and may have immunomodulating properties. Mechanisms may include inhibition of viral enzymes or processes such as viral DNA and RNA polymerase, viral protein glycosylation, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, and virus release. Other mechanisms may also involve ACE2 cellular receptor inhibition, acidification at the surface of the cell membrane inhibiting fusion of the virus, and immunomodulation of cytokine release. Preclinical in vitro data suggest hydroxychloroquine has activity against SARSCoV-2. 7,8 Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 Z 0.72 mM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 Z 5.47 mM) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in Yao X's study. 8 In case 2, hydroxychloroquine was added since illness day 18 after virus was not detected two days later, so it could not be concluded the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. An open-label, non-randomized clinical trial compared hydroxychloroquine treatment (n Z 26) to an untreated negative control group. 9 Preliminary data showed the proportion of patients that had negative PCR results significantly differed between treated patients and untreated controls. On day 6, 70% of hydroxychloroquinetreated patients were virologically cured compared to 12.5% in the untreated control group.",

In contrast, therapeutic lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon-beta-1b preserved pulmonary function but did reduce viral replication in vivo. 11 The first reported case in the USA showed a prompt reduction in fever and much-improved clinical symptoms after administration of remdesivir on day 12 of illness after administration of remdesvir starting on day 10 of illness. 3 Thereafter, the effectiveness of remdesivir garnered much attention worldwide. However, chest roentgenography of the aforementioned US case showed only relatively mild infiltrations, and the rRT-PCR assay of a oropharyngeal swab was negative on illness day 12, soon after remdesivir was first administered. Thus, the suppression of SARS CoV-2 activity by remdesivir needs to be further investigated, and as of now, there have been only a few clinical experiences.",

Cao and co-workers showed 199 adult patients with severe COVID-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavireritonavir treatment beyond standard care, and mortality at 28 days was similar in LPV/r group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; 95% CI, \u00c017.3 to 5.7). 12 Chu and coworkers assessed the effects of LPV/r compared to historic controls treated with ribavirin only. 13 Adverse events, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death within 21 days, were significantly lower in the LPV/r group than in the historic controls (2.4% vs. 28.8%, p < 0.001). In addition, a significant reduction in the need for rescue pulsed steroids (p < 0001) and significantly lower nosocomial infections were also noted in patients treated with LPV/r (p Z 0.043). Chan and colleagues demonstrated that the addition of LPV/r as an initial treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the overall death rate (2.3% vs 15.6%) and intubation rate (0% vs 11.0%) when compared with matched controls (both p < 0.05). 14 In a nonhuman primate model of common marmosets, subjects with MERS-CoV treated with LPV/r or interferon-beta-1b had better prognoses than untreated subjects. 15 In addition, a randomized placebocontrolled trial of MERS-CoV treated with a combination of LPV/r/interferon-beta-1b has been ongoing since 2016. 16 Based on the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS CoV-2, we prescribed LPV/r for our first two cases and presumed that it would suppress the viral load. Unfortunately, there was no obvious shortening effect on viral shedding in our limited dataset. In the future, peptides or small compounds that bind to carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cellular receptor for both SARS viruses, may be potential treatment agents. 17 The effective treatment is lacking, and some clinical trials investigating the efficacy are conducting globally. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 18 There are some limitations to this study. First, the study population was small because there were only a few confirmed and recovered cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan. Second, no documented effective medication could be used in a parallel group. However, the strength of our study is the complete dataset of Ct values obtained during hospitalization, and sputum and oropharyngeal swab specimens collected every 2 or 3 days to document the serial change in SARS CoV-2 viral shedding.",

Panel A (case 1) shows small areas of ground glass (arrows) in the peripheral zones of the lower lobes of the bilateral lungs on illness day 28 (before discharge). Panel B (case 2) shows patchy ground glass infiltrates (arrows) in the right upper lung on illness day 24. Panel C (case 3) shows multiple patchy ground glass infiltrates (arrows) in the bilateral lung on illness day 25. Panel D (case 4) shows a few patchy ground glass infiltrates (arrows) in the bilateral lungs on illness day 25. Panel E (case 5) shows normal finding in the bilateral lungs on day 32. CT scans were performed after at least two consecutive tests were negative in these 5 cases.",

Panel B shows the Ct values obtained using oropharyngeal swabs. Case 1 received LPV/r since illness day 5e8, and case 2 received LPV/r since illness day 2e14. Panel C shows the ratios of the Ct values for sputum and oropharyngeal swab samples, and for 67.5% (27/40) of the samples, the ratios were less than or equal to one.",
