Tuberculosis has been estimated to cause 7% of all deaths and 26% of preventable deaths in the developing world (1). Most deaths occur in young adults between the ages of 15 and 40 years, during their most economically productive years (2).",

Nevertheless it usually recommended that 4 standard drugs be given, namely rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Drugs that are available in some countries for parenteral use include rifampicin, isoniazid, and streptomycin, and these may be considered in cases where there are serious concerns of gastrointestinal absorption (13). The use of corticosteroids in patients with tuberculosis is discussed in detail elsewhere (43-45). However, most authors recommend the use of these agents to all patients with acute respiratory failure, provided the patients are initiated on effective anti-tuberculosis therapy (13,32). Similar recommendations are made for patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis in the ICU, particularly if they are extremely ill, severely hypoxic, or have involvement of the meninges or pericardium (6).",

While initially cardiac compression occurs due to fluid alone, later an effusive constrictive process may follow. This has been said to be the most common clinical presentation in South Africa, and is associated with increased pericardial pressure due to due to pericardial effusion in the presence of visceral pericardial constriction (46).

A positive acid-fast smear is very uncommon and culture is positive in 25-50% of cases (13). In a study from South Africa, tubercle bacilli were cultured from 59% of 189 pericardial effusions (46). Elevated levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in pericardial fluid were found to be helpful in assisting in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in a study from South Africa (46).

The addition of prednisone/prednisolone in dosages of 60 -80 mg/day is therefore usually recommended, unless contraindicated, to be tapered over 6 months (13). Patients not requiring pericardiectomy initially should be followed up with serial echocardiography and managed appropriately. Constrictive pericarditis due to tuberculosis requires anti-tuberculosis therapy, as for pericardial effusion, together with pericardiectomy for persistent constriction (46) Constrictive pericarditis with cardiac decompensation requires an urgent pericardiectomy (13).",

Meningitis occurs as a consequence of the rupture of a subarachnoid focus (Rich's focus that developed following previous haematogenous dissemination (50)), into the subarachnoid space (13). The major impact of the dense inflammatory exudate is on the basal meninges (so-called \"basal meningitis\")(13, 50). Cranial nerve involvement is quite common and with the inflammatory arteritis, vascular occlusion with cerebral infarction occurs commonly. Blockage of the basal cisterns by the inflammatory exudates may result in obstructive hydrocephalus. Most cases are referred to an intensive care unit for deteriorating neurological status (49).",
