Now as an ornamental groundcover, Lonicera japonica commonly planted in many areas for sprawling habit, numerous sweetly fragrant white flowers, attractive evergreen foliage, and become naturalized in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and United States. Due to Lonicera japonica has escaped from cultivation in several places, becoming a major nuisance, and is restricted in parts of North America and New Zealand (Starr et al., 2003). But in China, 1500 years ago, Lonicera japonica has been planted largely in Fengqiu county of Henan province, and the flowers of Lonicera japonica have been used as the local and traditional medicine in clinical practice for the treatment of exopathogenic wind-heat, epidemic febrile diseases, sores, carbuncles, furuncles and some infection diseases. Scine 1995, Lonicera japonica has been listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China and more than 500 prescriptions containing Lonicera japonica have been used to treat various diseases in China (http://www.zysj.com.cn). The modern pharmacological studies showed that Lonicera japonica and its active principles possessed wide pharmacological actions, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiendotoxin, blood fat reducing, antipyretic and other activities (Wang, 2008c). Most of these actions matched to those traditional uses seriously. At the same time, it was also used as food, healthy beverage in the world (Wang, 2010). Along with Lonicera japonica being used and cultivated in more and more countries, the chemical compounds have been extensively studied. Essential oils, organic acids, flavones, saponins, iridoids and inorganic elements as the main compositions were isolated and identified. Among of them, essential oils and chlorogenic acid have been proved with some good pharmacological effects, and were though as the active compounds of Lonicera japonica. In current Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2010), chlorogenic acid (1) has been officially used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of this herb.",

The flowering duration of individual plant is usually 5\u20138 days, but the flowering period is from May to September in the field, can be divided into six stages, i.e. the juvenile bud stage, the third green stage, the second white stage, the complete white stage, the silver flowering stage and the gold flowering stage. Lonicera japonica often grows in hillside scrub, rocks pile and roadside, and the highest altitude is 1500 m. Due to its beautiful flowers and strong roots, Lonicera japonica was cultivated for people to watch, conserve water and soil in world. In traditional Chinese medicine, due to the outline form of sprawling and twining lianas, and the different flower colors, the dried flowers or flower buds of Lonicera japonica was named as Jin Yin Hua and Ren Dong in TCM. Both the chemical contents and compositions of Lonicera japonica flowers vary in a flowering-dependent characteristic with the collection time (Fig. 1\n) (Wang et al., 2009).",

In addition, changes of the volatile components emitted from the living flowers throughout the whole day were investigated by dynamic headspace analysis using GC and GC\u2013MS, and the strongest odor was found to be emitted in the middle of the night (Ikeda et al., 1994). In 2010, Feng (2010) identified the content of chlorogenic acid from Lonicera japonica in different habitats by TLC. Results showed the content were 3.43%, 3.14%, 1.62% and 2.11% in Shanxi, Shandong, Hubei and Henan, respectively.",

In 2008, 9 iridoids, loganin (63), sweroside (64), secoxyloganin (67), secologanin (72), kingiside (74), ketologanin (78), 7\u03b1-morroniside (79), 7\u03b2-morroniside (80) and secologanoside (81), with 12 pyridinium inner salt alkaloids lonijaposides A\u2013L (82\u201393) were isolated from the flower buds. And in an in vitro assay, lonijaposide C (84) showed inhibitory activity against the release of glucuronidase in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) induced by the platelet-activating factor (PAF) with an inhibition rate of 69.5% at 10 \u03bcM, while compounds lonijaposides A (82) and B (83) give inhibitory activities with 11.0% and 35.8% inhibition rates at the same concentration, respectively. This suggested that the ethanol-2-yl unit at N-1 and the acid form of C-11 may increase the activity (Song, 2008, Song et al., 2008). Then, four new iridoid glycosides, named l-phenylalaninosecologanin (94), 7-O-(4-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyloxy-3-methoxy-benzoyl) secologanolic acid (95), 6\u2032-O-(7\u03b1-hydroxyswerosyloxy) loganin (96) and (Z)-aldsecologanin (97), also were isolated, together with a known one, newly named (E)-aldosecologanin (98), from the stems and leaves (Machida et al., 2002). From the dry flower buds of Lonicera japonica, 10 known iridoids and loniceracetalides A, B (99, 100) (secoiridoid glycosides) have been identified (Kakuda et al., 2000).",

But higher dose of the extract was required to suppress the expression of mRNA than protein. This result indicated that the extract acted translationally or post-translationally at lower doses and transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally at higher doses (Xu et al., 2007). Kang et al. examined the effect of water fraction of Lonicera japonica on trypsin-induced mast cell (HMC-1) activation. After stimulated with trypsin (100 \u03bcM), Lonicera japonica could inhibit TNF-\u03b1 secretion, tryptase mRNA expression and trypsin-induced ERK phosphorylation at a dose-dependent manner. However, it did not affect the trypsin activity even with 1000 \u03bcg/ml. These all indicated that Lonicera japonica might inhibit trypsin-induced mast cell activation through the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation than the inhibition of trypsin activity (Kang et al., 2004).

Flower of Lonicera japonica showed an inhibition of 5.8 \u00b1 1.7% at a concentration 100 \u03bcg/ml. And in 2008, Xi (2008) suggested that Lonicera japonica extraction showed an obvious therapeutic action on the influenza A virus infected Pneumonia mouse. The lung indexes of Lonicera japonica group and the ribovirin group were lower than the model group with the significance difference (P\n < 0.01), but no significance difference (P\n > 0.05) between these two groups. Lonicera japonica could reduce the histopathological changes, the viral duplication, and the contents of influenza virus nucleic acid (P\n < 0.01), compared to the model group). At the same time, the TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 expressions of Lonicera japonica group and the ribovirin group are lower than the model group with significant difference (P\n < 0.01).",

In vitro tests, Lonicera japonica showed 104 and 72 times of TI for anti-HSV (Herpes simplex virus)-1F and anti-HSV-1HS-1 to acyclovir (ACV). But in vivo tests, the anti-viral activity of Lonicera japonica was closed to ACV (Wang, 1999). As to the caviid beta herpesvirus 1, Lonicera japonica showed significant inhibition of the duplication of guinea pig cytomegalovirus in cell level.

But, Hu et al. suggested that the total flavones of Lonicera japonica have significantly protective effect on immunological liver injury in mice. Administered ig*10d, the total flavones (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) could significantly decrease the raised liver and spleen indexes, and improve the aggravated liver histopathologic changes. In addition, this extract could reduce the high levels of NO and iNOS in liver homogenate and inhibit the expression of TNF-\u03b1 in liver tissue. This mechanism possibly was due to diminishing the inflammation mediators (Hu et al., 2008).",

The apoptosis induced by PDT combined with Lonicera japonica extract was accompanied by DNA condensation, externalization of phosphatidylserine and formation of apoptotic bodies, it showed to be caspase-3-independent apoptosis via activation of AIF. P38-associated pathway may be involved in apoptosis induced by PDT with Lonicera japonica in CH27 cells. These demonstrated that they induced CH27 cells apoptosis was probably related to its ability to change the protein expression and distribution of heat shock protein 27 (Leung et al., 2008). When the aqueous extract of Lonicera japonica (100 \u03bcg/ml) was applied to the HepG2 cells, the lysates of the treated cells were associated with increased stimulatory phosphorylation of JNK and p38 as compared to the basal value, similarly to the MAPK activation profile of PCA. Further experiments showed that this aqueous extract also decreased the viability of HepG2 cells to 50%. So Yip thought that the aqueous extract of Lonicera japonica could trigger HepG2 cell death in a JNK-dependent manner (Yip et al., 2006).",

(2006) has employed the binary chromatographic profiling in fingerprint analysis of Lonicera japonica, Correlation analysis showed that six chromatographic peaks in ethanol extract were positively correlated with in vitro bacteriostasis activity. Two standard fingerprints were developed with 10 genuine samples of Lonicera japonica. Similarity analysis with a limited number of samples showed a fair consistence in the chromatographic profiling of Lonicera japonica from various sources and two harvests, and significant differences from other species. Combination use of the two fingerprints demonstrated confirmative identification and quality assessment of Lonicera japonica.",

The single oral dose of the ethanol extract at 5000 mg/kg did not produce mortality or significant changes in the general behavior and gross appearance of the internal organs of rats. In subacute toxicity study, the ethanol extract was administered orally at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day for a period of 14 days. The satellite group was treated with the ethanol extract at the same dose and the same period and kept for another 14 days after treatment. There were no significant differences in the body and organ weights between the control and the treated group of both sexes. Hematological analysis and clinical blood chemistry revealed no toxicity effects of the extract. Pathologically, neither gross abnormalities nor histopathological changes were observed. Then, Chang et al. (2003) assessed the toxicological assessment on food safety of the flower bud of Lonicera japonica. Acute toxicity test showed LD50\n > 15 g/kg Bw. on mice orally. And micronucleus test of bone marrow cell and Salmanella typhimurium/mammals microsomal enzyme test showed it was safe without mutagenesis. Meanwhile no toxicity test on mice and in antifertility test on SD female mouse. In summary, the extract was found to be fairly nontoxic when oral acute and subacute toxicities in rats were performed. Chronic toxicity study is needed for further support the safe use of this plant.",

Of these, due to the good antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities, chlorogenic acid and luteolin were used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of Lonicera japonica and the preparations in Chinese Pharmacopoeia. But recently, chlorogenic acid and luteolin were found in other medicinal plants, and even the contents were higher than Lonicera japonica (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2010). So employing chlorogenic acid and luteolin to control the quality of Lonicera japonica lacked specificity. At the same time, Wu suggested that the antibacterial of the flavones of fresh flower buds were 4 times of chlorogenic acid, and iridoids were also presented the marked biology activities (Wu et al., 2001). The different habitat, harvest's time, medicinal parts, extraction methods, fresh flowers and dry flowers would result in the different chemical compositions and the quality of Lonicera japonica. So, how to exclusively and accurately control the quality of Lonicera japonica in TCM and preparations should be studied further.",
