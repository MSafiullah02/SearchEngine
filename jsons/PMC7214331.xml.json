Although so-called \u201csheltering in place\u201d is proving to be an effective way to decrease community transmission, patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, like warfarin, may be harmed by such policies. Routine reporting of patients to outpatient clinics of hospitals or laboratories for checking their international normalized ratio (INR) places them at risk for community-acquired infection from COVID-19, whereas not traveling for INR checks places them at risk for a complication of over- or under-anticoagulation as INR levels can be labile in many patients on VKAs.",
