PDCoV has been reported initially in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012). In early 2014, PDCoV was first detected in pigs in the U.S. (Wang et al., 2014a). Since then, PDCoV has been identified in numerous U.S. farms, South Korea, Canada, Thailand and some provinces of China and the virus has been associated with substantial economic losses (Wang et al., 2014b, Sinha et al., 2015, Hu et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2016, Song et al., 2015, Zhai et al., 2016). However, little is known about the prevalence of PDCoV in Hebei, one of the major pig breeding provinces of China. Therefore, epidemiological studies based on serological and/or virological assays are valuable for the assessment of the PDCoV distribution to implement control strategies if needed.",

The M protein of coronaviruses plays an important role in the induction of protection and in mediating the course of the disease (Fleming et al., 1989, Vennema et al., 1991). Cross-reactivity of PDCoV with antibodies to either PEDV or TGEV M protein has not been previously observed (Chen et al., 2015, Jung et al., 2015, Ma et al., 2015, Jung et al., 2016). Therefore, the M protein may be an ideal candidate for the detection of PDCoV specific antibodies and diagnosis of PDCoV infection. In this study, a recombinant M protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and used to investigate the antibodies against PDCoV in porcine serum.",

            "text": "Since PDCoV was recently identified, serological assays available for the detection of antibody against PDCoV are limited. ELISA is suitable for testing a large number of samples (Zhang, 2016). A recombinant PDCoV S1 polypeptide-based ELISA and a recombinant PDCoV N protein based ELISA have been developed to detect PDCoV IgG antibodies (Thachil et al., 2015, Su et al., 2015). Neither ELISA methods cross-reacted with antisera against PEDV, TGEV and other pig pathogens and these results were supported by other research studies using indirect immunofluorescence assays (Chen et al., 2015) and immunohistochemical staining assays (Jung et al., 2015, Ma et al., 2015). However, a recent research study reveals that the conserved or similar epitopes on the N proteins of PEDV and PDCoV could cause two-way antigenic cross-reactivity of the two viruses (Ma et al., 2016). No cross-reactivity was detected by virus neutralization, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunostaining assays using pig hyperimmune antisera to PEDV or PDCoV in that study (Ma et al., 2016) and the PEDV whole virus-based ELISA and the S1 protein-based ELISA showed no cross-reaction with pig antisera against PDCoV, PRCV or TGEV Purdue strain (Chen et al., 2016). While the S protein gene has a high degree of variability in the members of coronaviruses (Su et al., 2015), which could lead to decreased sensitivity, N protein gene is conserved, which could lead to cross-reaction to porcine coronaviruses (Ma et al., 2016).",

Considering that there is possibility that antibodies produced by PDCoV infection may cross-react to other porcine coronaviruses antigen, and that it may affect the validation of the developed ELISA, serum samples used to establish the cutoff value were negative for antibodies against TGEV, PEDV and PRCV. The ROC curve assay showed that the relative sensitivity and specificity of the PDCoV-rM ELISA were 90.6% and 93.3%, respectively, indicating a potential diagnostic application compared to previously developed ELISAs (Thachil et al., 2015, Su et al., 2015).",

The detection results showed that 11% of samples were positive for antibodies against PDCoV. The total positive rate of the PDCoV antibodies in samples is similar to that reported in Heilongjiang province (11.6%) from January 2014 to June 2015 (Su et al., 2015). When compared with samples from farms with occurrence of diarrhea, the positive rate in Hebei province (11%) was much lower than that in Heilongjiang province (27.5%) (Su et al., 2015). In addition, the positive rate in weaning pigs (7.35%) was lower than that of suckling pigs (12.1%) and sows (16.9%) in our study. The relatively higher levels of antibodies in suckling pigs may be due to presence of maternally-derived antibody and are in agreement with the results that the PDCoV genome was absent in suckling piglet fecal samples in southern China (Zhai et al., 2016). Overall, the obtained data suggest that PDCoV has been circulating in the Hebei province.",
