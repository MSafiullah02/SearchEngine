In our own studies, we found an esophageal variceal bleeding-related death rate of nearly 40 % [ 2 , 3 ] , although in-hospital death rate of variceal bleeding has dropped considerably within the last decades [ 1 ] . However, a rather high percentage of patients still die before they are admitted. Hence, despite the fact that bleeding is no longer the most frequent complication of liver cirrhosis, preventing bleeding from varices induced by portal hypertension remains a major treatment aim. The natural history of liver cirrhosis induced by chronic viral infection [ 4 ] shows an occurrence rate of ascites and hepatocellular carcinoma of around 2 % per year after diagnosis of compensated liver cirrhosis, while variceal bleeding occurred only in 5 % of patients within a time period of 10 years. Furthermore, bleeding is often more a bystander than a cause of severe liver decompensation. Nevertheless, variceal bleeding is a dramatic event and clinicians have been developing strategies for its treatment and prevention over decades.",

Portal hypertension is defi ned as portal pressure, which exceeds the pressure in the vena cava by more than 5 mmHg [ 6 ] . It is commonly assumed that varices develop once this pressure surpasses 10 mmHg; a pressure threshold established as signifi cant portal hypertension. If this pressure is higher than 12 mmHg, esophageal varices may rupture and bleed [ 5 , 6 ] . Most bleedings are intestinal, namely from esophageal varices and gastric varices, while large collaterals embedded in the paraintestinal tissue very rarely show spontaneous rupture.",

Thus, hemodynamic factors such as the esophageal variceal blood pressure or-indirectly-the portal blood pressure on the one hand and morphological characteristics of the vessel, such as size and properties of the wall, on the other hand [ 7 , 9 ] possibly deliver indications about the risk of bleeding and therewith prognostic information.

In patients with previous variceal hemorrhage, this hepatic venous portal pressure gradient (HVPG) was nearly always greater than 12 mmHg. Yet, this pressure could in fact represent the threshold for formation of varices rather than serve as a good discriminator for bleeding, since many retrospective studies [ 14 , 15 ] failed to fi nd signifi cant differences of the average HVPG between bleeders and non-bleeders. Few data exist on the risk of diurnal pressure changes, e.g., induced by meals or physical activity, which can be quite remarkable [ 16 ] . Furthermore, portal fl ow may vary considerably between patients with a similar degree of portal hypertension. There is some evidence that blood pressure within the varix or transmural pressure [ 17 ] , which, however, is ideally assessed invasively, might be a better predictor of variceal bleeding [ 18 ] .",

Chronic administration of these available drugs might therefore play a role in the pre-primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. However, randomized trials are lacking to date. Around 10 years ago, a homologue to ACE, the so-called ACE2, has been described [ 46 ] . ACE2 degrades the active angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, which binds to the so-called MAS receptor. This receptor elicits contrary effects to AT1Rmediated processes; it blunts fi brosis and causes vasodilation. Thus, ACE2-defi cient mice show more severe liver fi brosis, while the administration of recombinant ACE2 reduces experimental liver fi brosis [ 47 , 48 ] and reduces portal hypertension via the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 by dual effect prevention of AT1R stimulation and increased MAS receptor stimulation.

Consequently, ligation has become the endoscopic procedure of choice in the prevention of fi rst variceal bleeding [ 105 ] . Typically, 2-3 sessions of ligation are necessary. The interval between these sessions varies between the groups from 1 to 3 weeks, with 2-3 weeks [ 106 ] as possibly the best interval for the repetition of the procedure.

It is believed that the latter phenomenon contributes about one third to the degree of portal hypertension. The speculation by the French group of Clichy that portal tributary blood fl ow could be reduced by administration of a nonselective \u03b2-blocker was indeed ingenious. The blockade of \u03b21-adrenoceptors decreases the cardiac index and therewith the splanchnic infl ow. At the same time, blockade of the \u03b22-adrenoceptors renders \u03b11-adrenergic reaction unopposed within the splanchnic vasculature, which results in vasoconstriction and a further drop in splanchnic perfusion [ 108 ] . The decreased splanchnic perfusion and consequently the reduced portal venous infl ow achieve-on average-a reduction of portal pressure by 12 % [ 109 , 110 ] . It is believed that it is mainly this long-term reduction of portal pressure under continuous intake of propranolol that reduces the bleeding risk, as shown consistently in randomized controlled trials [ 111 ] . It was suggested early on that propranolol should be dosed up to a reduction of the heart rate by 25 % or the maximal tolerated dose. Once this hemodynamic reaction is achieved, 20-40 % of patients [ 109 , 110 ] show a decrease of HVPG by \u226520 %, which is believed to be the best prognostic sign for prophylaxis success. An analysis of the data of 589 individual patients from four randomized trials [ 111 ] showed that the percentage of patients without upper gastrointestinal bleeding increased from 65 % (controls) to 78 % (verum groups) within 2 years. The percentage of patients without fatal bleeding increased from 82 % (controls) to 90 % (\u03b2-blocker). There was a trend in favor of prolonged survival, but this was far from being signifi cant (71 % vs. 68 %, p = 0.34).",

In rat models of cirrhosis, low-dose administration of losartan could reduce portal pressure and improve vascular hypocontractility, and fi nally, renal function [ 45 , 89 ] . While we found no additional effect when adding irbesartan to low-dose propranolol for reduction of HVPG, sodium excretion increased when we added the AT1-antagonist [ 138 ] .
