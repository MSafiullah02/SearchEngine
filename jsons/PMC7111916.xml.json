In the past few years, also two novel human CoVs, NL63 and HKU1, have been identified causing rather severe symptoms in infants and the elderly (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005). The discovery of so many novel CoVs calls for a better understanding of the phylogeny of CoVs.",

More recently, these groups have been further subdivided into, in total, 9 subgroups, based upon amino acid similarity of structural and non-structural proteins (nsp) (Snijder et al., 2003, Woo et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2007). However, other studies propose at least 5 distinct lineages (Tang et al., 2006, Dong et al., 2007, Vijaykrishna et al., 2007), and even for SARS-CoV there is discussion whether it represents a separate lineage (Rota et al., 2003) or is an early split-off of group II CoVs (Snijder et al., 2003, Gibbs et al., 2004). Thus, in addition to the conventional pair-wise comparison of viral protein sequences, other genetic or structural features may be helpful in the classification of CoVs.",

In Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a group II CoV, a bulged stem\u2013loop and a pseudoknot structure were identified in the 3\u2032 UTR (Goebel et al., 2004a). Similar pseudoknot structures were found in other group I and II CoVs, showing structural conservations of the CoV 3\u2032 UTR (Goebel et al., 2004a). However, the 3\u2032 UTR of MHV could be functionally replaced by the 3\u2032 UTR of group II SARS-CoV but not by that of the group I Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or the group III Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), indicating certain group-specific functions for the 3\u2032 UTR (Goebel et al., 2004b).",

Sequence comparison further showed conserved and unique features for each CoV group, including: (i) the relative location of the core sequence of the leader transcription-regulating sequence (L-TRS) is quite conserved in all CoVs, except for the one in group Ia CoVs which has a rather long leader sequence upstream of the core TRS; (ii) the potentially translatable short ORF upstream of the genomic ORF1ab, the uORF, is present in most CoVs except for group IId, IIIb, IIIc, and IIId CoVs; (iii) the 5\u2032 UTR in group III CoVs is substantially longer than that in group I and II CoVs, while group IIa CoVs have an exclusively short 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 1). It has to be noted that in order to obtain a higher threshold of the phylogenetic distance, strains with the highest sequence variation were used for analysis (selected from the genomic sequences of all CoVs available in GenBank). This made it more promising if homology was found within a cluster. To further examine if particular features found in the RNA sequence in each group are relevant to specific organization of the 5\u2032 cis-acting elements, we globally predicted the secondary structures of the CoV 5\u2032 UTRs, predominantly using computational calculations at the mfold webserver (Zuker, 2003). We have identified several conserved stem\u2013loop (SL) structures in this region, some of which are organized in a group-specific manner (see Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n).",

We found that the core L-TRS and the adjacent sequence may fold into SL3 in some CoVs, e.g. the group II Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), SARS-CoV and Bat coronavirus HKU4 (BatCoV-HKU4), and the group III coronavirus SW1 (CoV-SW1), Bulbul coronavirus HKU11 (BuCoV-HKU11), and Munia coronavirus HKU13 (MuCoV-HKU13) (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). However, the sequence variations found in group IIa CoVs are partially in conflict with the lower part of SL3, while in other CoVs there are no co-variations to support the formation of SL3. Thus, the CoV SL3 may not structurally resemble the L-TRS Hairpin (LTH) found in the related arterivirus, the Equine arteritis virus (EAV), which directs discontinuous transcription (van den Born et al., 2004, van den Born et al., 2005). In some other CoVs, e.g. TGEV and the Human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), the core L-TRS was predicted to participate in the stem of SL4 (Figs. 2A and B), although sequence variations found in group Ib CoVs do not strongly support the involvement of the core L-TRS in the SL4 stem (Fig. 2B). All in all, based on the structural\u2013phylogenetic survey, it can be concluded that the core L-TRS and the flanking sequences are poorly structured in CoVs.",

We noticed that 4 different patterns of the SL5 substructural hairpins were found in group I CoVs. This finding supports the idea that group I CoVs may be clustered into 4 subgroups, groups Ia to d. Nonetheless, the structural homology of SL5 within the lineage of the group I CoVs is still higher than that of the group II CoVs; three hairpins, SL5a, b, and c, with mainly the conserved 5\u2032-UUCCGU-3\u2032 loop sequence, were found in all group I CoVs. This is in agreement with the shorter phylogenetic distances found between each subgroup (group Ia\u2013d) in group I CoVs compared to group II CoVs, which feature more diverse sequence insertions, in terms of length, the presence of 5\u2032-UUYCGU-3\u2032 motifs, and secondary structure. The greater structural variation in SL5 of group II CoVs is as follows: (i) the substructural hairpins are replaced by an 8-nt sequence in group IIa CoVs (Fig. 5E); (ii) one of the three substructural hairpins in SL5, SL5c, contains a GNRA tetra-loop sequence (group IIb) or a non-conserved hepta-loop sequence (group IIc) but not the UUYCGU motif (Figs. 5F and G); (iii) only two substructural hairpins are folded on top of SL5 in group IId CoVs, yet an additional conserved UUCCGU motif is present in SL5.1 located further upstream, in between the L-TRS and SL4 (Fig. 3, Fig. 5). Thus, the pattern of the SL5 substructures is strongly related to the lineage and the phylogenetic distance of the group I and II CoVs.",

In fact, several (tandem) U:U mismatches were identified in the SL5 substructural hairpins, e.g. the SL5a in the group Ic Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Fig. 5C) and the group Id Bat coronavirus 1A (BtCoV-1A) (Fig. 5D), as well as in other 5\u2032 cis-acting elements, e.g. the MHV SL1 (Li et al., 2008).

For other groups of CoVs, e.g. SARS-CoV, the identification of a putative PS has been reported by Hsieh et al. (2005). This PS was thought to be a homologue of the MHV PS located in the corresponding region near the 3\u2032 end of ORF1ab. However, it has to be noted that the specificity of the proposed SARS-CoV PS to direct RNA packaging was not determined in their study, and the predicted secondary structure of their \u201chomologue of MHV PS\u201d lacks the conserved features of the MHV PS structure reported by Chen et al. (2007). Also we doubt the possibility of identifying a MHV-like PS in the \u201ccorresponding region\u201d of SARS-CoV genomic RNA because an alignment of nsp15 sequences clearly shows that the sequence corresponding to the MHV PS is absent in SARS and other non-group IIa CoVs (Fig. 7\n).",
