Alphaviruses mentioned on the CDC list (such as eastern equine encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus) are currently not considered to be agents of major concern in Germany. Another difference is the listing of food and water safety threats on the CDC list, such as Salmonella, E. coliand Shigellaspecies. Furthermore, the CDC list includes emerging pathogens which are often omitted from bio-threat lists. In terms of public health response, those pathogens are covered by other mechanisms such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) and nationally by the German Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG).2\n",

It allows abrogating basic rights such as freedom of assembly or freedom of movement in order to control the spread of infections.

ZBS1 works on highly pathogenic viruses, including developing diagnostic methods and strategies on how to combat and prevent infections with highly pathogenic viruses. Also affiliated to ZBS1 are two consultant laboratories: for tick-borne encephalitis and for orthopoxviruses. ZBS2 works on highly pathogenic bacteria, develops diagnostics for bacterial pathogens of high-risk groups, and also focuses on assuring the quality of diagnostics, e.g. through interlaboratory experiments (EQADeBa3). ZBS3 works on microbial toxins, including research on their pathogenesis. ZBS4 provides rapid diagnostics of relevant pathogens; mainly, this department focuses on different forms of electron microscopy. ZBS5 plans the building and setting up of a BSL-4 facility that is currently under construction. The newest addition, ZBS6, works on proteomics and spectroscopy of highly pathogenic organisms.",

The main purpose of this matrix is to identify pathogens with potentially severe public health consequences. Currently, 127 biological agents are scored and divided into four priority groups. The list contains not only bacteria and viruses but also prions, fungi, parasites and even an unidentified agent (unidentified agent causing Kawasaki syndrome). Only one of the \u201cclassical\u201d biothreat agents scores in the highest priority group of this list pertaining to naturally occurring diseases (Staphylococcus aureustoxins). Several others are grouped in the second (e.g. Brucellaspp., several hemorrhagic fever viruses, SARS corona virus and Variola virus) or the third priority group (e.g. Bacillus anthracis, different Burkholderiaspecies, Francisella tularensis, Vibrio choleraeor Yersinia pestis), while several others are not listed at all (e.g. equine encephalitis viruses, Nipah virus, Japanese encephalitis virus). The fact that toxins such as abrin, ricin or saxitoxin are not mentioned reflects the fact that these are not transmissible pathogens.",

In order to improve the preparedness of allied armed forces against emergencies due to natural epidemics or acts of bioterrorism, the Committee of the Chiefs of Military Medical Services in NATO (COMEDS) decided in Vilnius 2008 to build a multinational Deployment Health Surveillance Capability (DHSC) which was established in January 2010 at the BundeswehrMedical Office in Munich [1]. Its main task will be the near-real-time epidemiological monitoring and symptoms-based detection of outbreaks during missions.

These concepts were adapted to the special requirements of the medical support of soldiers deployed in Germany or abroad, resulting e.g. in the influenza pandemic planning and BundeswehrHospital Alert and Emergency Plans.",

It offers civilian and military researchers as well as medical and political stakeholders from all over the world a scientific forum to exchange actual assessments of biological risks and threats, perspectives and developments in diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and anti-epidemic management of diseases caused by pathogens of concern, and reconnaissance and verification of unusual events.
