One hundred and twenty\u2010six healthy infants, living in the Rotterdam area (the Netherlands), were included in this prospective birth cohort study and were followed until 2 years of age. Recruitment of children took place at the Department of Obstetrics (Sophia's Children Hospital), at health centres, and among participants of the PIAMA birth cohort study (22). Eighty\u2010six infants (68%) were selected who had a family history of atopy, defined as allergic disease in one or both parents. Parents with self\u2010reported asthma, hay\u2010fever, house dust mite allergy, or pet allergy were considered to be allergic. This was established with a validated screening questionnaire (23). Forty infants were selected with a negative family history of atopy; infants of whom both parents reported not to have allergic disease. The Erasmus University Medical Ethics Committee in Rotterdam approved the study design and parents of all infants gave informed consent.",

However, the importance of rhinovirus in infants has been underestimated. It is only in recent years that PCR techniques have become available. These techniques can detect rhinoviruses more accurately than the viral culture methods used previously (26). In adults, rhinovirus has already been shown to be the most prevalent viral pathogen during URTI (15, 16). We have now shown that rhinovirus is the most frequently detected viral pathogen during URTI and rhinitis in infants as well. This is in accordance with recent data from the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study that observed similar high rates of rhinovirus infection in infants during episodes of URTI and acute otitis media (21, 27). It can therefore be concluded that rhinovirus frequently infects both infants and adults.",

Epidemiological studies indicated that frequent respiratory tract infection in infants, associated with day\u2010care attendance or the numbers of siblings, may reduce the risk of developing allergic disease 10, 11, 12). On the basis of extensive virus diagnostics, this study found prevalences of viral infections in infants in day\u2010care, in particular rhinovirus, which were \u223c2.7 times higher than those for other children. We therefore concluded that the indirect indications of protection by recurrent respiratory infections in epidemiological studies, such as by day\u2010care attendance, are probably rhinovirus infections to a large extend. A well\u2010known protective factor for lower respiratory infections during childhood is breast\u2010feeding whereas a parental history of allergic disease and exposure to tobacco smoke have been described as risk factors (22, 28, 29). Remarkably, in contrast to lower respiratory tract infections, the same studies showed that breast\u2010feeding, a parental history of allergic disease and exposure to tobacco smoke did not relate to upper respiratory tract infections. In line with these reports, we also did not observe a relation between a family history of atopy, breast\u2010feeding or smoking by one or both parents and the prevalence of rhinovirus infections during routine visits at 12 months.",

Only a few coronavirus infections were detected in children of 12 months and older. Below the age of 24 months, the prevalence of RSV remained \u223c20%. This is likely to decrease during later childhood because prevalences up to 13% have been reported in adults (30). At the age of 18 months, most children (75%) will have been infected with RSV at least once (31). The prevalence of rhinovirus increases slowly to more than 50%. In adults, a prevalence of 80% has been reported for rhinovirus during the common cold (16). This indicates that rhinovirus prevalence found in infants in the present study may increase further. Why does the prevalence of rhinovirus remain unaltered or even increase gradually, whereas the prevalence of RSV decreases with age? For RSV, which has few different serotypes, humoral and cellular responses may possibly protect the child from frequent re\u2010infections. By contrast, over 100 different serotypes of rhinovirus are present (32). Re\u2010infection with rhinovirus is therefore likely to occur with a new serotype for which the child does not yet have induced humoral and cellular responses.",

This maturation is likely to result from repeated stimulation by pathogens, rather than from a single viral infection. The general effect of a particular virus is dependent on both the prevalence of the virus and on the type of host immune response upon infection. RSV is capable of inducing a general inflammatory response in infants which largely induces an immune response towards Th1 (33). Since now rhinovirus has been found to be more prevalent than RSV in infants, the question arises to what extend rhinovirus infections are able to influence the infant immune maturation and modulation. We are currently investigating what type of immune response a rhinovirus infection can induce in infants and whether this type of immune response differs between infants with URTI and rhinitis (van Benten et al., unpublished data).",

As the nasal mucosa is colonized by bacteria, it is likely that it can also harbor respiratory viruses (35).
