The first positive test was identified on January 21st in Snohomish County, when a man presented to a local hospital with typical symptoms and a history of recent travel to Wuhan, China. The power of the virus revealed itself several weeks later in a skilled nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, a Seattle suburb located 11 miles from downtown, and only 8 miles from the main campus of the University of Washington, when the first documented U.S. death occurred. At least 37 residents of the Life Health Center later succumbed, and on March 11th, Gov. Jay Inslee restricted gatherings of more than 250 people in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties. Two days later, he announced that all schools in the state would close for six weeks, and two days after that, with coronavirus infections and deaths still rising, he revised his restrictions on gatherings to a 50 person maximum and ordered the temporary shutdown of all bars, restaurants, gyms, hair and nail salons, and other social gathering places to stop the spread of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed every aspect of \u201cnormal\u201d practice in a large academic institution. As vascular surgeons we are looked upon to be leaders and the so-called \u201cfiremen\u201d of the hospital, responding to urgent intraoperative consultations and requests from our medicine and surgical colleagues. Our practice consists of treating the highest risk patients with both cutting edge, minimally invasive techniques and large open procedures. Our patients require the use of personnel, equipment (gowns, gloves, masks), and hospital space for their recovery. The majority of our practice is in the elderly population, who often require other medical specialties to assist in their care both before and after a procedure. On March 12, 2020 our department announced that elective cases should be postponed in an effort to create capacity for the expected surge of COVID-19 patients. We quickly mobilized and created our list of non-elective procedures and planned on treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) measuring greater than 5.5cm, chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) with tissue loss, dialysis access, and acute limb ischemia. We rescheduled all other cases and trimmed our clinic patients based on these parameters; however, as stated earlier, in discussion with our Italian colleagues (Drs Pierantonio Rimoldi and Germano Melissano) who were a few weeks ahead of us in the pandemic, we quickly adopted their plan of performing only emergent procedures.2 We employed the following philosophy: if a patient was seen in clinic and scheduled for a procedure in the future, the procedure was elective. Our mindset therefore changed, and although it was not a comfortable feeling among our surgeons, we recognized that even a CLTI or AAA patient seen in clinic is usually not scheduled emergently, but rather is scheduled after appropriate risk stratification has been performed.",

To our surprise, most of our patients understood our reasoning, and many were relieved to hear that they did not need to enter the hospital and potentially be exposed. In addition, as our hospital has imposed a strict visitation policy, many of our patients would be entering the hospital and not have family support during their recovery. We enacted teleconferencing and telemedicine protocols to maintain our communication with patients and for our division (Table I) and have found that after employing these methods, we have not been flooded with acute cases or patients requiring amputations at this point. Our clinical volume has decreased significantly, and many of our consultations have been able to be handled with telehealth.",

To combat the lack of procedures, we have added more electronic educational events, including daily recorded lectures, and continue to work on scholarly activities and research, all of which can be accomplished remotely. By concentrating on areas of productivity, we can maintain trainee morale and education, with the assumption that the operative volume will return once the pandemic surge ends. However, for any program, the lack of procedures will be a lingering concern as we are asked to do less in the operating room.",

As our institutional practices have changed, from testing only symptomatic patients to now testing all patients being admitted to the hospital, our operating room policies have also changed and now include testing of all surgical patients pre-operatively. While emergent cases with pending tests were originally performed using full airborne precautions, this quickly became unsustainable. Thus, our operating room policy has shifted to using full airborne precautions only for those with pending tests who are unable to give a reliable history, which is in contrast to those patients who have a pending test but are able to deny any symptoms of infection. For these patients, full airborne precautions are only maintained during the 30 minutes following intubation and extubation, when the anesthesia provider is the only person present in the operating room. Internal reports have noted previously that during these 30 minutes, circulation within the operating room clears over 99% of air particles, and thus our institution has adopted the policy of proceeding with standard precautions following the 30 minute recirculation period in patients with pending tests who are asymptomatic and thus deemed low risk.",

If we consider even our emergent case of the open ruptured juxtarenal AAA patient, we can see the resources required. During that procedure, the patient\u2019s colon appeared potentially threatened, and thus a temporary abdominal closure was performed. A subsequent colectomy and repeat laparotomy and closure was required, with the patient developing respiratory failure post-operatively with CT scan findings concerning for COVID-19 infection. The patient was therefore transferred to a COVID unit until the results of testing were negative. In addition, the patient also suffered a myocardial infarction during recovery, necessitating percutaneous coronary intervention. This all occurred during the restricted visitation policy, and thus the family of the patient, who could not visit in person, were updated remotely. Ultimately, the patient was transitioned to comfort care measures only after he failed to progress. While it is difficult to understand whether this patient\u2019s outcome would have been different in \u201cnormal\u201d situations, what is clear is that the amount of resources required for this emergent procedure would likely not be available during a true crisis.",

Our guidelines will continue to be malleable as the situation requires, and we are starting to plan for a return of capabilities as our situation in Seattle allows. We believe in our system and understand we may have a unique perspective, and that other locations may be in a different stage of this pandemic.
