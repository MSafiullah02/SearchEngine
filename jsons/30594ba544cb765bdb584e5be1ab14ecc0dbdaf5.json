[1] [2] [3] The management of perioperative echocardiography in suspected and infected pediatric patients requires careful consideration of this infectious risk, including personal protective equipment. [3] [4] These significant considerations have recently prompted specific statements for echocardiography in these settings from the American Society of Echocardiography, the British Society of Echocardiography and the Italian Society of Echocardiography and Cardiovascular Imaging. [5] [6] [7] The unique considerations for echocardiography in pediatrics and congenital heart disease have now also received due attention. 8 The purpose of this freestanding editorial is to provide perspectives on this important disease for the perioperative echocardiographic community with respect to pediatric and congenital heart disease patients. The indications, venue, and approaches for imaging will be discussed in these settings to offer a framework to navigate these compelling considerations in pediatric practice. These recommendations will be examined from the perspective of the cardiovascular anesthesiologist and perioperative echocardiographer to encourage best practices in this clinical arena. The provided references can also assist policy leaders in their management of the pandemic at their institutions.",

            "text": "Pediatric echocardiography, including transthoracic, transesophageal, and fetal imaging, has established indications and procedures. 9-10 Based on published appropriate use criteria for pediatric echocardiography, the indication for an echocardiographic examination is considered appropriate when the expected incremental information, combined with clinical judgment, exceeds the expected risks to a acceptable and reasonable degree. [10] [11] Furthermore, an indication for echocardiographic imaging has been classified into one of 3 categories: generally appropriate (as reflected by a median panel score of 7-9); maybe appropriate (as reflected by a median panel score of 4-6); and , rarely appropriate (as reflected by a median panel score of 1-3). [10] [11] [12] The goal with this scale of appropriate use criteria has been to minimize echocardiography examinations in pediatric practice for rarely appropriate criteria. [10] [11] [12] With the advent of the coronavirus crisis and the potentially life-threatening risks of infection, the imaging indication in pediatric echocardiography should be carefully screened with a preference for delaying examinations that are either elective or that are rarely appropriate in accordance with institutional practice. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Emergency examinations in pediatric echocardiography with strong indications therefore have a high priority to proceed. Given that the intensity of the coronavirus crisis is variable and dynamic, the triage of echocardiography examinations must remain agile and responsive to local conditions. 13 This management process should also focus on strict infection control. [1] [2] [3] Fetal echocardiography should also be triaged based on published levels of risk. 14 A fetal echocardiogram for a low-risk patient will typically have a low-risk referral indication in the setting of a normal cardiac screening exam and as such has a low priority for further consideration during the peak of the coronavirus crisis. 8;14 A fetal echocardiogram for a moderate-risk patient will typically be indicated by a moderate-to-high risk referral indication with a gestational age greater than 24 weeks or by confirmed congenital heart disease with a gestational age less than 34 weeks. 8;14 These examinations can typically be rescheduled after the 4 peak of the crisis has passed. 8 A fetal echocardiogram for high risk patients will typically include an urgent clinical indication, or a moderate-to-high risk referral indication with a gestational age less than 24 weeks, or conformed congenital heart disease with a gestational age above 34 weeks. 8;14 The examinations in this category should be scheduled as soon as possible.",

            "text": "Airborne precautions against viral droplet infection include N-95 masks, N-99 masks as well as powered air purifying respirators. [15] [16] Transesophageal imaging in suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection has a heightened risk of viral transmission due to the increased load from viral aerosolization. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] It may be reasonable during the height of the crisis to assume that all children who require transesophageal examinations are positive for the infection. In the setting of a protocol for disease testing, a documented negative test within 48-72 hours may be considered adequate at some institutions to conduct the examination with standard precautions such as eye protection, mask and gloves rather than the enhanced standards with full personal provider equipment. 8 In pediatric patients who do not have known testing results and who have an endotracheal tube prior to arrival in the operating room or interventional suite, the risk of viral transmission from aerosilization is considered low. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] What about the risks for viral aerosolization in asymptomatic untested children who do not have an endotracheal tube negative and who require transesophageal imaging in the operating room or interventional suite? In this scenario, it is reasonable to plan that the infectious risk is high, assuming that these children may be positive and that endotracheal intubation generates a high load of aerosolized viral particles. 8 In this setting, airway management and probe placement should likely proceed with maximal barrier precautions, including personal provider equipment and consideration for air turnover in the given space. 8 It is also reasonable that the transesophageal probe be placed and positioned by the airway team during aerosol precautions to minimize operators and infectious risks. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] In the setting of children with known 7 positive infection, full isolation and aerosol precautions should apply not only for the conduct of the echocardiographic examination but also the overall care of those pediatric patients. 4-8; 15-16 The intensity of the coronavirus crisis at a given institution challenges in many ways not only the imaging protocols and but also the infectious control procedures for pediatric perioperative echocardiography. A further consideration for infection control concerns the appropriate care of echocardiographic equipment (the 'hardware') to minimize the risks of viral transmission. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The relevant probes and machine consoles may be covered with disposable plastic. Depending on institutional circumstances, certain hardware can be specifically designated for imaging of suspected or confirmed pediatric cases of coronavirus infection. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Although most disinfectant solutions are viricidal, all echocardiographic equipment should be processed thoroughly for the goals of viral clearance and hardware functionality with maximal protection of patients and ultrasound providers. [25] [26] [27] Despite the variations in sanitation protocols, these standards should comply with the recommendations from the American Institute for Ultrasound in Medicine to balance infectious risks with imaging performance. 4-8; 25-27 Education and teaching in pediatric echocardiography are important. 13; 24 During the coronavirus crisis, however, learner wellbeing has a higher priority. 24 In this stressful clinical learning environment, it is reasonable to cancel elective rotations and to restrict trainee exposure. 24 Furthermore, education in echocardiography can be transitioned to distance-based learning, including remote conferencing technology. 24 The protection of echocardiography personnel can be enhanced further by thoughtful assignments for staff with risk factors for severe infection such as advanced age, chronic conditions, immunosuppression, and pregnancy. 8 ",
