Zoonotic diseases carry a common ancient history between human and animals as a result of pathogen exchanges involving transgression of the species barrier. Nowadays, several agents have been targeted for their potential to be a major risk for human and animal populations and, have been characterized by their potential to be highly pathogenic and/ or transmissible, and lacking of any means of protection. Those agents have been listed as \"Select Agents\" having the potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health, as well as to animal and plant products. Several of the most dangerous agents responsible of viral hemorrhagic fever are review in this chapter including: Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Rift valley fever virus, Kyasanur forest virus, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus. 1015 ",

The nosologic term of \"Zoonosis\" has been crafted to gather all transmissible diseases harboring a potential to infect both human and animal (Palmer et al. 2001) . Zoonosis (i.e. zoonotic diseases) are transmissible diseases between animals and man with an infectious (microbes and prions) or parasitic origin. In another term, a zoonotic disease represents any animal disease communicable to human and/or vice versa. Ultimately, zoonosis can be transmitted from animals to humans, directly or indirectly, sometimes by a vector or an intermediate host, or also from humans to other animals. This is considered as reverse zoonosis and called anthroponotic disease, or zooanthroponosis. Zoonoses can be of viral (Yellow Fever, HIV, hantavirus) , bacterial (tularemia, leptospirosis, lyme disease), rickettsial (Q-fever), fungal (aspergillosis, histoplasmosis), parasitic (giardiasis, cryptosporidiasis), or prions (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) origins. Also the mechanisms of transmission are the main factors driving the risk of human infection. Infectious agents are transmissible under natural circumstances from wild or domestic vertebrate animals to humans. They can also be transmitted from animal products causing foodborne diseases, e.g. Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, Calicivirus, or Salmonella.",

Indeed, several zoonoses have been known since early prehistoric times. The first hominids were in direct contact with animal groups which previously appeared on Earth some 540 million years ago (ya.). The history of mankind, starting with Australopithecus, begins about 5 million ya. and coincides with the first contact and potential of microbe exchanges between fauna and this human precursor. Also, one of the most ancient hominids, Australopithecus, was not hunter, but a pretty game (!) hunted by large and powerful carnivorous. Also sick and infected individuals were eaten by such large predators, and human epidemics turned short (Debr\u00e9 and Gonzalez 2013) . Earlier Homo species from the Pleistocene era (2.6 million-11,700 ya.) utilized larger animals for subsistence (Rabinovich et al. 2008) including mammoths, long horned bisons, saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths, among others mammals of North America, Asia, and Europe. It is quite acceptable that these creatures were able to exchange their parasites, e.g. intestinal and blood parasites or fur ectoparasites, with humans.",

First attempts to domesticate dogs, goats, and sheep, occurred as early as 15,000-9,000 ya., giving rise to domestic zoonotic parasitic disease. Ultimately, about 1000 ya., 22 species were domesticated including dog, goat, sheep, cattle, camel, pigs, and chicken. Later, during the Neolithic period, when agricultural practices appeared, domestication was well under way supporting the appearance of e.g. flea-or louse-transmitted bacterial zoonoses or pyogenic infections after contact to wild and domestic animals. In fact, in prehistoric times, when human populations were organized in small tribes with a limited number of 100-200 individuals, the human population was actually an accidental victim of infectious diseases, developing rapidly an herd immunity and leaving the pathogens to infect and survive in the more abundant animal populations (e.g. anthrax, rabies, tularemia, cysticercosis) (Debr\u00e9 and Gonzalez 2013) .",

The species barrier can easily be violated when species are sympatric and/or taxonomically closely related (e.g.: Arenavirus and different rodent species). Although some pathogens have a high infectious specificity and are usually restricted to infect one host species, some of them can pass the species barrier after a mutation or genetic re-assortment (e.g.: the SARS coronavirus from chiropteran to Palm civet, avian influenza from bird to pig) and/or after an alteration of the permissive host (e.g. due to immunodeficiency). Ultimately, zoonotic diseases result from parasites, sensu lato, that can live apparently harmlessly in a natural host while producing disease upon entry into a different host. Some prominent examples are e.g. HIV having a non-human primate origin and influenza viruses generated from pig and bird viruses after genetic re-assortment, both subsequently evolving to be adapted to a human-to-human virus transmission.",

            "text": "Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) appear as a whole clinical entity characterized by (high) fever and bleeding that can progress to shock and death. The first severe VHF identified was the Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (1976), although the Marburg virus was isolated and characterized earlier in 1967; Marburg virus, however, appears in the medical literature as part of the nosocomial framework of VHF only in 1977 when published aside with the Ebola virus (Bowen et al. 1977) . Later, several already known VHF joined the concept including: the Hemorrhagic Fevers with Renal failure (known since 1951), the Hantavirus in 1978 (Lee et al. 1978) ; the Lassa fever and Bolivian and Argentine HF, Yellow Fever, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and others. The group of VHF was identified as a nosologic entity associated with viruses belonging essentially to five distinct families of RNA viruses: the four Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae. Only recently in September 2012 scientists reported the isolation of a member of the Rhabdoviridae family responsible for VHF in the Bas-Congo district of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Grard et al. 2012) . Several VHFs share many important features: (1) many of them may be transmitted by arthropod-borne agents (usually mosquito vector), (2) person-to-person transmission is possible through direct contact with infected patients, their blood or other body fluids; (3) natural animal reservoirs are mainly rats and mice, but also domestic livestock, monkeys or other NHP may serve as intermediate hosts. Moreover, with the increasing international travel, these mainly tropical viruses may now be imported into non-endemic countries thus posing a major global risk for human public health. Furthermore, several of these agents have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks involving health care and laboratory workers. Due to special biosecurity concerns, we will mainly focus in the following on Filoviruses, RVFV, other flavivirus responsible of hemorrhagic fevers, Kyasanur Forest disease and Omsk HF. Alkhurma HF virus is cited in cursory detail because its limited geographic distribution.",

The same studies described similar results with Ebola's cousin in the filovirus group, Marburg virus, showing that it too needs NPC1 to enter cells (Carette et al. 2011; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2011 ). Furthermore, NPC1 was shown to be critical to filovirus entry because it mediates infection by binding directly to the viral envelope glycoprotein (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2011 confirmed the findings that NPC1 is a critical filovirus receptor that mediates infection by binding directly to the viral envelope glycoprotein and that the second lysosomal domain of NPC1 mediates this binding. Carette et al. (2011) showed mice that were heterozygous for NPC1 were protected from lethal challenge with mouse adapted Ebola virus.

Human-to-human transmission occurs via direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person (including embalming of a deceased victim) or by contact with contaminated medical equipment such as needles. In the past, explosive nosocomial transmission has occurred in underequipped African hospitals due to the reuse of needles and lack of implementation of universal precautions.

Marburg virus has been isolated from blood; serum; secretions, including respiratory and throat secretions; semen; urine; and various tissues and organs from human or animal hosts, or their homogenates (Fisher-Hoch 2005) .",

Traces of EBOV were detected in the carcasses of gorillas and chimpanzees during outbreaks in 2001 and 2003, which later became the source of human infections. However, the high lethality from infection in these species makes them unlikely as natural reservoir . Plants, arthropods, and birds have also been considered as possible reservoirs; however, bats are considered the most likely candidate. Bats were known to reside in the cotton factory in which the index cases for the 1976 and 1979 outbreaks were employed, and they have also been implicated in Marburg virus infections in 1975 and 1980 . Of 24 plant species and 19 vertebrate species experimentally inoculated with EBOV, only bats became infected (Swanepoel 1996) . The absence of clinical signs in these bats is characteristic of a reservoir species. In a 2002-2003 survey of 1030 animals that included 679 bats from Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, 13 fruit bats were found to contain EBOV RNA fragments (Leroy et al. 2005) . As of 2005, three types of fruit bats ( Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata) have been identified as being in contact with EBOV. They are suspected to represent the EBOV reservoir hosts (Pourrut et al. 2007 ).",

LF occurs in rural West Africa, and appears to be hyper-endemic in Sierra Leone with an antibody prevalence of 8-52 %, Guinea (4-55 %) and Nigeria (21 %). Natural transmission of Lassa virus (LASV) occurs from its domestic, ubiquitous, prolific and common multimammate rodent virus reservoir, Mastomys natalensis. As for other Arenaviruses it is transmitted to humans directly through rodent urine and faeces or indirectly by contaminated food. Person-to-person transmission has been described posing a risk for healthcare workers. The virus can also be contracted by an airborne route or by direct contact with infected human blood, urine, or semen, up to three months after clinical recovery. LF is a prominent threat outside the endemic area with several imported cases in Germany (Gunther et al. 2000) , Japan (Hirabayashi et al. 1988) , the United States (Holmes et al. 1990 ), the United Kingdom (Kitching et al. 2009 ) among others. About 80 % of patients experience a mild or asymptomatic infection. LF has a relatively low mortality rate up to 5 %. Among the endemic countries, it is estimated that LF is responsible for about 5000 deaths a year. Pregnant women have the greatest risk of fatality. After an incubation period of 1-3 weeks an acute illness develops while the virus infects every tissue from the mucosa (e.g., intestine, lungs and urinary system) and subsequently progresses to the vascular system. Initial non-specific symptoms include fever, facial swelling, muscle fatigue, conjunctivitis and mucosal bleeding. Later on there might develop gastrointestinal tract bleeding, bloody vomiting, dysphagia, melena, accompanied with cough, dyspnea worsening to cardiovascular system dysfunctions (pericarditis, tachycardia) and hepatitis; finally hearing deficit, meningo-encephalitis and seizures occur. Death is due to multiorgan failure. With respect to this multiple organ infection and accompanying HF signs differential diagnoses include other VHFs such as Ebola or Marburg, malaria or influenza (Yun and Walker 2012; for a review 4 ).",

This is followed by a 2-4 week period in which a rash develops and progresses from macules, to papules, to vesicles, and then to pustules, followed by umbilication, scabbing and desquamation (CDC 2003) . The rash is usually confined to the trunk, but can spread to the palms and soles of the feet, occurring in a centrifugal distribution (Parker et al. 2007) . Lesions can also develop on mucous membranes, in the mouth, on the tongue, and on the genitalia (Nalca et al. 2005) . The pathogenicity of monkeypox is similar to that of smallpox except for the pronounced lymphadenopathy associated with monkeypox and generally milder symptoms (Heymann 2008) . Lymphadenopathy is thus considered to be a key distinguishing feature of monkeypox (Weber and Rutala 2001) . The CFR is approximately 1-10 % in Africa, with higher death rates among young children (Parker et al. 2007 ). In children unvaccinated against smallpox, the case-fatality rate ranges from 1 to 14 % (Heymann 2008) . In addition, children may be more susceptible to monkeypox due to the termination of regular smallpox vaccinations following the worldwide eradication of the disease in 1980.",

Also Rodent and Chiropteran are one of the most species richness among the vertebrate orders, they harbor a variety of viruses that can be potentially infectious for human.

An analysis of all documented events has led to develop a spatial and temporal approach for a better understanding of dynamic risk factors (so-called drivers) associated with disease emergence (Souris et al. 2010) . By understanding these variable drivers of different scales (e.g. from molecular to spatial, including environmental factors) using computing assisted analysis and mathematical models we might finally be able to predict and hopefully prevent emerging zoonotic infections (Morse et al. 2012) . Obviously, theoretical models will have always to be sustained by accurate survey networks coupled with multidisciplinary research.

EEEV transmission is most common in and around freshwater hardwood swamps in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the Great Lakes region. Between 1964 and 2010, there were 270 confirmed cases of EEE in the US. Several states in the northeastern USA have seen increased virus activity since 2004. Between 2004 and 2006, there were 17 equine cases and at least 13 human cases of EEE reported in Massachusetts. In 2006, approximately 500,000 acres (2000 km 2 ) in southeastern Massachusetts were treated with mosquito adulticides to reduce the risk of humans contracting EEE. Subsequently, between 2007 and 2010, there were two confirmed human cases and six equine cases reported to CDC and USDA respectively. In October 2007, a citizen of Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland became the first European victim of this disease. The man had visited New Hampshire during the summer of 2007 on a fishing vacation, and was diagnosed as having EEEV on 13 September 2007. He fell ill with the disease on 31 August 2007, just one day after flying home.",
