If there were another one, all measures should be taken to keep a section of the hospital clean, so that the regular activities could continue for as long as possible. Sooner or later patients have to be transferred to makeshift hospitals. If this is done in the early phase of the disease 2 , normal activities could be continued for much longer and priority cancer patients would benefit of timely treatment. The early testing of health personnel and patients and the use of adequate protective gear would prevent the dissemination of disease in the hospital, which has been catastrophic in our case. These measures would reduce the number of infections among the health care personnel, would maintain an area of the hospital clean, and would increase the capacity to continue the regular activities with non-Covid-19 patients.",

In early March, the commission in charge of the hospital organization during the pandemic restricted the outpatient clinic to the day-hospital for onco-hematologic treatments and the surgical activity to priority oncologic operations. However, with the exponential increase of Covid-19 patients, the outpatient clinics and the postsurgical recovery rooms had to be transformed into hospitalization wards and intensive care units, respectively, and the respirators of the operating rooms had to be used to ventilate Covid-19 patients. The result is that no surgery can be performed other than emergency cases and no new patients can be seen in the outpatient clinics. Our hospital is like a casualty hospital. All wards are filled with Covid-19 patients. Nearly 300 health professionals are infected and more are in quarantine for having been in close contact with infected patients or colleagues. Those who can still work are devoted exclusively to Covid-19 patients. Some patients have been externalized in a nearby hotel because there was no room in the hospital. Pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons and oncologists, who usually meet in tumor boards, are now working in improvised medical teams attending infected patients. There is only one thoracic 3 surgeon who controls the chest tubes and performs tracheostomies. Tumor boards are now conducted virtually, if there are patients to discuss. The numbers in surgical waiting lists and of patients waiting to be diagnosed are increasing. The consequences",
