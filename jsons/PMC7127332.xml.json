In the interest of public health, rapid and accurate methods for differentiating and identifying aerosolized bacteria, fungi, and viruses are needed. Early recognition of airborne pathogens would be extremely important in preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases. Microbial identification systems designed for this purpose could effectively be used in industrial/agricultural settings, health facilities, and locations where large groups of people assemble for work, leisure, or travel. Mounting concerns regarding the deliberate use of biological substances as weapons by state-sponsored organizations and terrorist groups [4], [5] also places a high priority on fast, reliable techniques for detecting airborne pathogenic microorganisms.",

Lipid biomarkers, and in particular, the relative concentration and distribution of the fatty acid moieties, have long been recognized for their chemotaxonomic importance [16], [17]. Classification, based on varying distributions of fatty acids, has become a routine method in microbiology laboratories. A typical method involves saponification of whole microbial cells releasing glycerol bound fatty acids followed by methylation and subsequent extraction of the derivatized fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) into a nonpolar organic solvent. Separation and analysis of the FAME extract is then completed by gas chromatography (GC). Exemplifying this technique is the well known commercialized Microbial Identification System (MIDI) [18].

Efforts to reduce the sample preparation time were successfully accomplished by Dworzanski [19], [20] and Holzer [21]. Both research groups utilized an on-line derivatization procedure in which whole bacterial cells, in the presence of strongly basic methylating reagents (e.g. tetramethylammonium hydroxide or trimethylanilinium hydroxide), were pyrolyzed in the injector block of the GC. Thermal hydrolysis and subsequent methylation of the cellular lipids was observed to occur nearly instantaneously during each heating cycle. The resulting chromatograms of the volatile methyl derivatives showed a high degree of similarity to FAME profiles obtained from extracts prepared by conventional wet-chemistry methods. Aside from coating a pyrolysis filament with a mixture of sample and derivatizing reagent, no further sample manipulation was necessary, hence reducing the chance of losing or contaminating the sample. The thermal hydrolysis/methylation (THM) technique required only 5\u201310 \u03bcg of sample, whereas the wet chemistry procedure required 10\u201315 mg of sample. Therefore, the THM process is better suited for situations involving low levels of analyte. A thorough review of on-line derivatization procedures using quaternary ammonium salts has been published [22].",

In these studies, sample preparation and mass analysis were accomplished in less then five minutes producing spectral profiles featuring taxonomically significant biochemical signals. For the present study, use of this rapid technique was extended to the analysis of intact fungi, pollen, viral infected cell culture media, and proteins. These biological samples were chosen to emulate constituents normally found dispersed in the atmosphere. The aim of this current report was to identify characteristic biomarkers that could facilitate the differentiation of these samples from each other and from whole cell bacteria. For comparison, five known human pathogenic bacteria were included in the analysis. Positive identification of pathogenic bacteria collected during atmospheric sampling must include an initial step that is capable of differentiating the prokaryotic organism from a multitude of other possible airborne constituents.

Mass spectra were collected as a set of raw intensities and normalized to constant length to correct for variations in total ion current. The following equation was used:xi,j*=xi,j*1000/\u2211j=1nxi,j2,where x\ni,j* is the normalized intensity of mass spectrum i and mass j, 1000 is a constant scaling factor and n is the number of masses in the spectrum. Mass peaks corresponding to m/z 207, 267, 281, 327, 341, and 355 were omitted (silicone contamination) from the calculations. The multidimensional data set was mean centered and reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) to a smaller collection of factors still containing a significant proportion (\u223c95%) of the total variance. Subsequent examination of this reduced set of factors or principal components (PCs) was conducted using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In this way, mass spectra from samples listed in Table 1 (five replicates of each run in random order) were used to train a model for classifying unknown samples. Test sets were produced from the same samples examined in triplicate and submitted, as unknowns, to the LDA model for classification. Samples for the training set, first test set, and second test set, were analyzed on July 21, August 3, and August 19, 1999, respectively. Cross-validation was used as an assurance against over fitting the trained models with measurement noise [29].",

For each fungal species studied, a distinctive series of peaks (m/z 410, 396, 378, 363,337, and 253) were detected and identified as products of electron ionization of ergosterol. The mass peak observed at m/z 396 is the molecular ion of the free steroid while the mass peak observed at m/z 410 corresponds to the methylated derivative. The incomplete derivatization of ergosterol is attributed to the fact that steroids are weakly acidic and as such do not favorably methylate to form ethers during the THM process [22]. Chemically, this process involves the liberation of bound ergosterol and fatty acids by saponification and transesterification (competing mechanisms) following the application of an aliquot of a methanolic solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide to the intact fungal cells. The released fatty acids (as well as any naturally free fatty acids), being more acidic, are readily deprotonated in this highly basic medium and form salts with the quartenary ammonium cations. These salts thermally degrade (nucleophilic attack of the carboxylate anion upon the quartenary N-methylammonium cation) to FAMEs and tertiary amines when heated to a sufficiently high temperature.",

Also originating from saturated FAMEs, but lower in abundance, is the series of fragment ions detected 31 Da. ([M-31]+) below the molecular weight of the precursor fatty acid. Mechanistically, these ions are created by homolytic cleavage of the methoxy group resulting in the formation of a stable acylium ion. For unsaturated FAMEs, the two major electron ionization fragment ions were observed at 32 Da. ([M-32]+) and 74 Da. ([M-74]+) below the molecular mass of the analyte.

Therefore, the detection of FAMEs with two or more double bonds could be used to corroborate the presence of eukaryotic organisms. In addition, if mass peaks from ergosterol are also detected, then it may be inferred that the sample contains fungal cells. Unfortunately, fungi do not produce a large variety of fatty acids, as such; there is not much variation between different FAME profiles [31]. This limits the ability of using THM-MS to identify whole fungal cells at the genus or species level. However, the THM mass spectra exhibited by fungi do differ significantly from profiles generated by bacteria, pollen, viral infected media, and proteins.",

Two such media were examined by THM-MS and the mass spectra are shown in Fig. 2\n(a\u2013b). These two media were inoculated separately, one with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), and the other with Venezuela Equine Encephalitis (VEE). For comparison, a non-infected medium (same medium used to propagate VEE) was also analyzed and is shown in Fig. 2(c). From an earlier study, it was found that viruses do not contribute significantly to the overall mass spectrum from cell culture media [27]. The relative contribution of the viruses to the total mass of the cell culture medium is only about a tenth of a percent and accordingly does not generate an intense set of ion signals (relative to the cell culture media). Hence, the two mass spectra (Fig. 7(b\u2013c)) of media recovered from Vero cell cultures (one with the virus the other without) are essentially indistinguishable. It was further discovered that the major source of fatty acids and steroids detected from the media supernatant originated from blood serum.

This biomarker has also been detected from a purified mouse hepatitis virus [23] further substantiating its general use as a mammalian/viral signatory biomarker. For enveloped viruses, cholesterol is incorporated within the lipid bilayer that covers the viral protein coat. Furthermore, the virus acquires both steroids and lipids from the host and therefore the composition of these biomarkers will resemble the media that was used in propagation. It can further be postulated that if a selective trapping method is employed to capture airborne viruses prior to THM-MS analysis then mass spectra simliar to those shown in Fig. 4 will be generated and directly attributed to the viruses.",

Proteins were included as a comparative measure of the isobaric effects made by a biological compound containing no lipids. The mass spectra from three protein standards, mass analyzed following thermal treatment with TMAH, are shown in Fig. 4\n. Peaks were observed at virtually every mass signifying the complicated nature involved with the thermal clevage of high molecular weight proteins. Thermal degradation coupled with electron ionization produces a mulititude of possible fragmentation mechanisms resulting in a complex mixture of predominantly low molecular weight gaseouse ions. The most abundant ions observed in the subsequent mass spectra are the smaller (generally below 150 Da), more volatile distillents. The ions observed in the mass spectra illustrated in Fig. 4 are most likely dipeptide remnants and diketopiperazines that were formed by a known intra-polypeptide cyclization mechanism [37].",

The experimental setup was designed to enrich the cellular lipid fraction and minimize contributions from proteins, carbohydrates, and DNA. Lipid products, from thermal degradation of biological samples, are more volatile than other constituent biochemicals, especially for the mass range above 180 Da. Consequentially, by maintaining the transfer line from the heating chamber at lower temperatures (140\u00b0C), we could effectively prevent (by condensation onto the cold walls) less volatile thermal products from reaching the ion source. In fact, for proportionally similar amounts of samples, the total ion current (TIC) from whole cells (containing lipids) was an order of magnitude or more greater than the TIC produced from pure proteins. Needless to say, there does exist isobaric contributions from cellular proteins, but the overall contribution is minimal. In view of their negated significance to this study, no further attempt was made to identify the protein mass peaks demonstrated in Fig. 4.",

This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 5 for Y. pestis (Fig. 5(b)) and V. cholera (Fig. 5(c)), respectively. The base peak observed in both spectra is from the molecular ion from C16:0Me. Monounsaturated, C18:1 (m/z 296) fatty acid, is also prevalent to Gram-negative bacteria and is noticeable in both spectra by the appearance of the electron impact fragment ions at m/z 264 ([M-32]+) and m/z 222 ([M-74]+). Similarly, C16:1 (m/z 268), detected by its fragment ions at m/z 236 ([M-32]+) and m/z 194 ([M-74]+), was also detected in both spectra. Cyclopropyl heptadecanoic acid (cyC17:0), known to be produced by Y. pestis (and not by V. cholera) [40], accounts for the greatest difference between the cellular fatty acid profiles of these two bacteria species. Chemical signals corresponding to the losses of 32 and 74 Da from the methyl ester of this cyclopropane fatty acid (m/z 282) were observed at m/z 250 and m/z 208, respectively.

Thus, along PC1, samples which generated mass spectra with these peaks in high abundance will plot on the negative side of the axis while those samples with these peaks in lesser abundance will plot to the positive side. The polyunsaturated FAMEs are responsible for the grouping of both the pollen and fungi samples on the negative half of PC1. Several bacterial samples were also slightly negative along PC1. Both Y. pestis and V. cholera exhibited an intense C16:0Me peak while B. melintensis produced m/z 264 ([M-32]+, C18:1Me) in high abundance. The postive loadings are mainly the mass peaks extending from m/z 186 to m/z 230. This region of the mass spectrum appears to be most characteristic of the protein standards which consequently had the most positive scores on PC1. Although the viral media samples showed both FAME and steroid peaks in their mass spectra, they also contained high abundances of the lower mass peaks common to the proteins. On account of this proteinaceous influence, the viral media samples also grouped to the positive half of PC1. Futhermore, the cholesterol molecular ion (m/z 386), common only to the viral media samples, contributes to the slightly positive loading value for PC1.",

In fact, the influence of this biomarker on both PC1 and PC2 makes it possible to separate the pollen samples from the other classes. The fungi can be isolated due to the ergosterol peaks which cause this class to plot negative on the second factor axis.

For example, from the loading plot for PC3, it can be seen that mass peaks originating from ergosterol impart a positive contribution to the variance while the contribution from the odd-chain FAMEs (C15:0, C17:0) is in the opposite direction.

Like the protein standards, the viral media samples also plotted in the right, upper quadrant (although their determined coordinates placed them to the left and above the protein samples). The most notable influence on the viral samples came from the loading for m/z 386 which is in the postive direction on CV2. Finally, samples representative of the bacteria plotted close to the score plot origin because of their more heterogenous distribution of fatty acids.
