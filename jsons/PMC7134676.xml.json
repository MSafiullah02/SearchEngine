Epidemiologic investigation of outbreaks of EVA has shown that the incidence of clinical to subclinical infection can vary from 1.4:1 to 1:6 in mares bred to persistently infected stallions.39 During the 1984 epidemic in Thoroughbreds in Kentucky, it was estimated that 57% of affected farms had one or two cases of EVA, and only 14% of premises had five or more cases of the disease.41\n",

Typical cases of the disease may present with any combination of the following: pyrexia of up to 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) that develops after an incubation period of 3 to 14 days (6 to 8 days after venereal exposure) that can be of 2 to 9 days duration; depression and anorexia; leukopenia; limb edema, especially of the hind limbs; stiffness of gait; nasal and lacrimal discharges; conjunctivitis and rhinitis; periorbital/supraorbital edema; mid-ventral edema involving the scrotum and prepuce of the stallion and mammary glands of the mare; urticarial-type rash that may be localized to the sides of the neck or face or generalized over most of the body; and abortion in the mare. Pyrexia and leukopenia are the most consistently observed clinical features of EVA. Less frequently observed signs include respiratory distress, coughing, diarrhea, ataxia, papular eruptions beneath the mucous membrane inside the upper lip, submaxillary lymphadenopathy, and adventitious edematous swelling in the intermandibular space, beneath the sternum, or in the shoulder region. Severity of clinical signs is likely to be greater in very young or very old horses and in debilitated animals. With rare exceptions, horses naturally affected with EVA make uneventful clinical recoveries even in the absence of symptomatic treatment. Mortality in natural cases of the disease is very uncommon and has only been reported infrequently in neonatal foals that succumbed from a fulminating interstitial pneumonia2., 41., 49. and in foals up to a few months of age affected with a rapidly progressive pneumoenteric syndrome.15\n",

On the other hand, stallions that have been acutely affected with the disease may undergo a period of temporary subfertility that is considered to be the result of increased testicular temperature rather than a specific side-effect of the virus. Reduced libido during the acute phase of infection is associated with decreased sperm motility, concentration, and percentage of morphologically normal sperm in ejaculates. These changes have been reported to persist for up to 6 to 7 weeks in stallions after experimental infection with EAV.34 Although the magnitude of these changes is sufficient to cause temporary impairment of fertility in certain stallions, no long-term effects on semen quality have been observed in naturally infected stallions, even those that have remained long-term carriers of the virus for several years.43\n",

Apart from the potential of EAV to cause abortion in mares and, very rarely, fulminating respiratory disease in young foals, mortality does not occur following infection with naturally occurring strains of the virus. This is in sharp contrast, however, to what has been seen in horses challenged with an experimentally derived velogenic variant of the Bucyrus strain of EAV. This experimental variant of the virus can cause up to 60% mortality in adult horses exposed by the respiratory route (McCollum WH, personal communication, 1983). Much of the confusion that currently prevails regarding this disease has stemmed from incomplete and misleading descriptions of EVA in some widely referenced texts.",

Five known epidemics of EVA have occurred in the past 40 years, all of them in North America. With the exception of the 1984 epidemic on Thoroughbred breeding farms in Kentucky, all of these occurrences took place at racetracks and were characterized by rapid spread of the virus, with several hundred horses becoming affected in each instance.42\n",

The importance of aerosol transmission has been documented in both natural and experimental infections,9., 24., 25. and it is very probably the primary route of dissemination of EAV during widespread outbreaks of the disease that occur infrequently at racetracks. Although virus is also shed in vaginal secretions,12., 26. urine,24., 26., 35. and feces,12., 35. during the acute phase of the infection, the amount and duration of virus shedding is greatest via the respiratory tract. EAV can be found in high concentration in respiratory secretions for up to 7 to 14 days.24 Another potential source of virus is the fetus, placenta, and placental fluids from a mare that has aborted as a result of EAV infection.5., 11., 26. It would appear, however, that close or direct contact is required for aerosol transmission to occur from any of the aforementioned sources of infection.6., 40.\n",

Re vaccination results in markedly enhanced serologic responses that persist for at least several breeding seasons (Timoney PJ, McCollum WH, Umphenour N, Roberts AW, unpublished data). The vaccine was used successfully to curtail the spread of EVA during the 1984 epidemic in Kentucky, and in three subsequent large-scale outbreaks of the disease that have occurred in North America. Its use as part of the EVA control programs in Kentucky and New York for the past 9 years has not been associated with any adverse sequelae.",

The possibility of introducing EAV into a group of susceptible horses can be minimized by isolating all horses returning from other farms, sales, or racetracks for 3 to 4 weeks. If feasible, segregation of pregnant mares from other horses is recommended. In the event of an outbreak of EVA, restriction of movement of breeding stock, selective vaccination, and, as an extreme resort, closure of the breeding sheds have been measures that have been successful in curtailing the spread of the disease among breeding farms.41\n",

Kentucky and New York are the only two states that have formulated preventive and control programs for their respective Thoroughbred breeding industries.41 Both programs are predicated on the unique significance of the carrier stallion in the epidemiology of this disease. This fact and the high frequency of the carrier state in recovered stallions have underscored the importance of identifying carrier animals in any population of breeding stallions and of implementing a policy of annual vaccination of all at-risk breeding stallions at least 28 days before onset of each breeding season. There are several advantages to this strategy, including control over establishment of the carrier state in additional stallions, and preventing possible venereal transmission of EAV in the breeding shed and precluding the need to screen mares entering the breeding shed for evidence of EAV infection. Additionally, all first-season stallions should be checked for presence of the carrier state before the start of each breeding season. Stallions that are confirmed semen shedders and carriers of EAV can continue to be used commercially, subject to certain safeguards being met. Carrier stallions should be kept physically isolated and bred only to mares that are seropositive from previous natural exposure or vaccination or, if seronegative, vaccinated not less than 3 weeks previously. After being bred, recently vaccinated mares should be kept isolated from other seronegative horses for a period of 3 weeks. These measures, when implemented fully, have been successful in preventing occurrences of EVA associated with the use of carrier stallions.",

Based on the results of recent studies confirming the testosterone-dependency of the carrier state in the stallion19 and the inability to establish long-term infection in the reproductive tract of prepubertal colts,16 EVA vaccination of all Standardbred colts between 6 and 12 months of age ought to be promoted as a means of preventing future establishment of the carrier state in these animals. Because there is a risk of inadvertently introducing EAV into a susceptible horse population through the use of infective fresh or frozen semen, measures need to be formulated to obviate this happening in those breeds in which artificial insemination is permitted.",

The most important consequences of this infection are abortion in the mare and establishment of the carrier state in the stallion. Equine arteritis virus becomes localized in the reproductive tract of a relatively high percentage of infected stallions which serve as very efficient transmitters of the infection through direct or indirect venereal contact with susceptible mares. The long-term persistently infected stallion appears to play a major epidemiologic role in the dissemination and perpetuation of the virus in horse populations throughout the world.
