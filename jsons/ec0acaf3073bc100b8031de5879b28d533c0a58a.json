            "text": "The novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly across the globe causing 1,850,220 confirmed cases at the time of writing and 114,215 deaths. 1 Cases have been reported in 206 countries and COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. The pandemic is causing substantial strain on healthcare systems worldwide due to a high frequency of affected cases requiring hospitalization and intensive care unit admission. 2 Health and social care workers (HSCW) are disproportionately affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare workers accounted for 21% of cases of SARS during the 2002 outbreak 3 , and recent experience in China and Italy confirms high rates of healthcare worker infections during the current pandemic. In China, up until February 24 th , 2055 healthcare workers were infected with 22 deaths. 4 in Italy it has similarly been reported that 20% of documented cases are healthcare workers. 5 In addition to the direct effects of the virus on HSCWs, infections have indirect effects on their families and staff morale and can have a significant impact on the ability of healthcare systems to function due to staff absence. Scotland recently began reporting staff absence rates in the health and social care sector showing that at the time of writing 1 in 20 staff were absent as a direct result of Current UK guidance for social distancing and self-isolation requires that HSCWs experiencing symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as cough or fever, should be absent from work for 7 days, while if a household contact is unwell, the staff member should be absent from work for 14 days to account for the incubation period of the virus. In most cases, particularly during the early stages of a pandemic, most respiratory illnesses will not be caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the rapid availability of testing would allow SARS-CoV-2 to be excluded and for critical healthcare staff to return to work. Nevertheless, widespread testing of HSCWs and their symptomatic household contacts (SHCs) has not been implemented in the United Kingdom or many other countries.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of a systematic testing programme for HSCWs across a health board (Healthcare region) designed to ensure healthcare system resilience by reducing sickness absence. The results show a striking save of over 8000 lost working days for health and social care staff over a period of just 3 weeks which is likely to have a significant impact on the ability of health systems to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. HSCW infections are a significant problem both from the point of view of delivering healthcare but also for patient safety as HSCWs may transmit the virus to vulnerable patients in hospital or care facilities. There have been few systematic studies of infections in healthcare staff, but one such study reported by Reuksen et al at two hospitals in the Netherlands found 4% of healthcare workers were infected. 8 Most infections were mild and many staff continued to work due to the mild nature of the systems unaware they had SARS-CoV-2. 8 We speculate that availability and awareness of a staff testing programme for those with mild systems and their contacts may reduce the pressure for staff to work while unwell and therefore reduce the risks of healthcare-associated virus transmission. There are some important considerations when implementing a staff testing programme. Firstly, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs have been reported to have a sensitivity ranging from 63% to 90%, but all studies suggest a sensitivity below 100%. 9,10 It is therefore theoretically possible that some individuals tested in our study returned to work with a \"falsenegative\" result. We acknowledge this is a risk, but this small risk must be balanced against the risk of decimating the healthcare workforce through isolation of all HSCWs when they or their close contacts develop symptoms. We also acknowledge that we did not test for other respiratory viruses and that HSCWs or their household contacts may be infected with other communicable viruses, however household isolation for these reasons is not part of standard healthcare practice outside of pandemics. It is acknowledged that the precise number of working days saved through this practice is difficult to estimate as not all HCSWs would be working full time and on all days during the isolation periods which leads us to overestimate days saved. We have assumed a single HSCW per household but this is not necessarily correct and a SHC testing negative in some cases would result in more than one HSCWs being able to work, leading us to underestimate the days saved. Therefore the estimates provided should be treated with caution but likely represent the maximum utility of a healthcare working testing programme. The ability to perform over 1800 rtPCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 is only possible if there is sufficient testing capacity and it is acknowledged that this could be a limitation to implementing widespread testing in other regions or other countries. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was only possible because of the availability of staff in the Virology laboratory in Tayside who are highly skilled in molecular diagnostic methods.",
