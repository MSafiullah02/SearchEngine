Ideal markers should be readily detectable in surrogate tissues such as peripheral blood lymphocytes with high precision and appropriate technical effort (\n2\n). As functional characterization of cellular protein markers is often complex and difficult, many studies are currently concentrating on DNA genotype and RNA expression analyses (\n3\n,\n4\n). Measuring steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in circulating lymphocytes should be a good choice as this determines not only efficient gene transcription but also correct processing and maintenance of mRNA. Regulation of mRNA expression is, however, tissue specific and can be affected by genetic and endogenous factors such as age (\n5\n), gender (\n6\n) and potentially body mass index (BMI). Exogenous factors like exposure to tobacco smoke (\n7\n) or nutrition-dependent serum antioxidant levels (\n8\n) have also been shown to influence mRNA expression. To obtain reliable results, these modifying factors have to be taken into consideration together with high technical standards in isolation and processing of RNA throughout the experimental protocol (\n9\n).\n",

Especially, polymorphisms affecting gene expression might be used instead of costly and time-consuming measurements of mRNA levels. It is, however, difficult to assess the impact of a single-nucleotide polymorphism on a highly complex cellular process such as mRNA expression when using molecular biology methods in cell lines that carry a certain genotype. Association studies evaluating the correlation between genetic variants and mRNA expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of an ample number of individuals should provide a better rationale for the use of genetic markers.",

Furthermore, low\nERCC1\nexpression in patients with ovarian tumors has been reported to be associated with increased clinical chemotherapy sensitivity (\n33\n).\nERCC1\nexpression in peripheral blood lymphocytes was recently found to reflect expression of this gene in head and neck cancer tissue, and it was suggested to be indicative for therapy success (\n31\n). The ratio of\nERCC1\nmRNA expression in tumor head and neck versus normal tissue was reported to predict the response to neoadjuvant therapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and radiation (\n34\n).\n",

These differences can be at least partially attributed to genetic variation but can also be modified by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as antioxidants. Only weak effects of single polymorphisms on\nERCC1\nexpression were detected but carriers of\nERCC1\nCC haplotype had significantly lower expression values than non-carriers. This low\nERCC1\nexpression might be associated with reduced DNA repair and better chemotherapy or radiotherapy response. Our study used primary lymphocytes as suitable surrogate cells to assess the impact of molecular markers in clinical/epidemiological settings, this is because target tissue samples are more difficult to obtain and only available by using invasive procedures (\n2\n). Published studies that aimed to characterize the functional impact of polymorphisms were mainly performed in immortalized tumor cell lines. However, these cells might have cellular characteristics considerably different from those of primary lymphocytes thus explaining some of the observed inconsistencies. Therefore, our\nex vivo\nresults in patients contribute to a better understanding of the impact of genetic variants on mRNA expression of DNA repair genes. Once validated in further analyses, such markers should provide valuable tools for the assessment of therapy response.\n",
