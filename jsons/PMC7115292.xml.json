            "text": "A-IC is a group of institution-specific measures that go above and beyond B-IC and enhance their effectiveness. It is vital that administrative support is sought to approve and fund the necessary initiatives. The following outlines the A-IC measures adopted at our institution (Table 1).1.\nInterdepartmental collaborative meetings: As part of the established institutional epidemic plan, using both interdepartmental collaboration and institutional expertise, daily morning meetings are held. These meetings are undertaken at a time of high incidence within the community, other regional institutions, or when an alert has been issued by the MOH. Key members include hospital administration, senior staff from the infectious diseases department, ICP, ED, ICU, nursing, microbiology, case management, and others as deemed necessary. Their objective is to assess, monitor, and recommend risk mitigation strategies. Current regional and international information regarding MERS-CoV disease activity, institutional preparedness, and its capabilities are discussed. During these meetings initiatives are formulated, implemented if applicable, and evaluated for success and/or modification. Measures to reduce risks referred to in this article as A-IC were discussed in these meetings and implemented institution-wide.2.\nInfection Control Risk Assessment: Multidisciplinary institution-wide infection control risk assessment to address areas of concern was undertaken. Areas of deficiencies addressed at the organization level include insufficient number of staff in high-risk areas, fit testing for high-efficiency particulate respirators (especially for ED, ICU, and direct patient care providers), overcrowding in the ED, ventilation systems in the ED, extended turnaround time of MERS-CoV test results, and awareness of the importance of early identification and isolation of suspected cases. With each automated telephone text message reminder of upcoming clinic or admission came an additional reminder to inform staff of any flu-like illness upon arrival. This is in conjunction with a prescreening process established in the ED and clinic receptions.3.\nMERS-CoV Epidemic Plan: A MERS-CoV epidemic plan was implemented as an extension of the existing institutional epidemic plan (Table 2\n, Fig 1\n).4.\nFlagging Electronic Charts: Real-time isolation supported by an electronic integrated clinical information system (ICIS) where transmission-based precautions are activated upon MERS-CoV order entry. Discontinuation of isolation precautions per ICP team protocol.5.\nICP Team On Call: Newly implemented permanent service to assist in bed use and ICP issues.6.\nInterhospital Patient Acceptance and Transfer Criteria: Referrals from outside centers require documented MERS-CoV testing before acceptance. Documentation of travel and exposure history has been established as a new routine practice for each admission, clinic appointment, or ED visit.7.\nOrdering, Collection, and Transportation of MERS-CoV Specimens: The criteria for MERS-CoV testing is based on currently approved MOH case definitions posted on the MOH Web site.3 Staff education and compliance monitoring of appropriate ordering, collection technique, and transportation of MERS-CoV specimens to optimize yield and reduce risk of false results.8.\nReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) MERS-CoV Testing Capability: To improve test turnaround time, patient management, bed/resource use, and decrease reliance on the MOH reference in-house MERS-CoV PCR testing capabilities were implemented. Turnaround time was reduced from 1 week or more to <6 hours, 7 days per week.9.\nStockpiling of Essential Supplies: On activation of the MERS-CoV epidemic plan stockpiling of essential supplies is initiated. An increase from the normal 6-month availability to an 8-month supply is authorized. Additional stockpiling is considered based on demand and/or anticipated market unavailability.10.\nHigh-Efficiency Particulate Respirator Fit Testing: Qualitative fit testing was undertaken for high-efficiency particulate respirators (eg, N-95 and R-95) as a major interdisciplinary performance improvement project. Of the hospital staff members who require fit testing (approximately 8,000 individuals) 50% were fit tested over a 12-month period. A permanent process was implemented to fit test the remaining staff and new hires. Fit testing results are documented in the employee's medical file on ICIS.11.\nAdvanced Airway Management: Use of indirect video laryngoscopy (eg, glidescope [Verathon, Bothell, WA]) for intubation and use of a high-efficiency particulate respirator for all intubations involving patients with suspected/confirmed airborne or droplet diseases and/or emergency respiratory failure due to respiratory illness was introduced as a standard of care. Powered air purifying respirators were purchased. Approved use includes during tracheostomy and other procedures (eg, lung biopsy for suspected/confirmed MERS-CoV cases) or when a high-particulate respirator mask cannot be worn (eg, HCW failed fit testing).12.\nED Contingency Plan:\na.\nReduce overcrowding: Administrative approval for institutional occupancy decrease by 20% with the aim to conversely decrease ED boarding of admitted patients.b.\nExternal prescreening capabilities: In anticipation of a patient influx, specialized outdoor tents that can be converted into negative pressure were purchased.c.\nReduce patient wait time (door-to-doctor time): The institutional standard median waiting time from presentation to the ED (door) and until examined by a physician (doctor) for all category patients (per the Canadian Triage Acuity Scale) is kept below 1 hour. To maintain and where possible reduce door-to-doctor time below 1 hour a lean methodology was used for all ED processes. A sustained reduction in waiting time was achieved for category 2 patients to around 30 minutes by implementing improved communication between ED staff.d.\nED early isolation and patient placement: Airborne infection isolation room are available in the ED for patients with airborne diseases. This was expanded to use for all patients requiring aerosol-generating procedures to reduce the risk of pathogen spread.10\ne.\nPatient transportation: Isolation transportation pods were purchased to be used for transportation of any patient suspected or confirmed positive for an airborne infectious disease, including MERS-CoV.\n13.\nPatient, Family, and Visitor Education and Communication: During epidemic plan activation a disease-specific education campaign is implemented. Posters, pamphlets, and the intrahospital television system are used for communication (Fig 2).14.\nStaff Education and Communication: Staff preparation training and specific education to care for patients with/suspected MERS-CoV was undertaken.15.\nTransparency: While maintaining confidentiality, transparency is important to enhance dissemination of accurate information to all staff. This can create an atmosphere of trust, loyalty, and support; therefore, HCWs are more likely to adhere to recommendations and reduce their absenteeism.\n\n",

The approval by executive management to implement the recommended ICP measures was primarily due to recognition of a true potential threat, and in support of recommendations by the taskforce. This prompt action and support is reflective of the mission, vision, and core values of our institution, which supports a culture of safety. Due to urgency, time for a prescheduled mock drill to test proposed interventions and make the necessary adjustments based on the results of the simulation was not possible at time of initial implementation. Changes or improvements to ICP measures occurred in real time with immediate effect. Ongoing monitoring for effectiveness occurred through observational HCW compliance monitoring, noting frequency of unprotected exposure events, and screening during outbreak investigations. Those working in our institution\u2014especially within high-risk areas (eg, ED and ICU) observed an increased level of anxiety reflected by an increased use of masks while not performing direct patient care. In particular, in the use of high-particulate respirators. In our opinion this anxiety was as a result of rumors and misconceptions of MERS-CoV transmission and number of actual cases within our institution, documented human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission, a high mortality rate (36%) that includes HCWs, limited treatment options, and the unavailability of vaccines.4 Communication and transparency helped to reduce levels of anxiety and rumor. Our reported MERS-CoV mortality rate of 62% is higher than that reported nationally and most likely due to the complexity and comorbidities of the patient population served in our major city tertiary care institution.",

Many of the A-IC measures implemented during this period have now become standard-of-care practices within the institution. Without administrative and leadership support, targeted resource allocation, and high HCW compliance rates, ICP measures would not be effective. This includes timely information dissemination, investment by the institution on education, ongoing awareness and staff development, adequate and high-quality supplies, and meticulous screening processes.
