Recently, due to changes in virus classification, the virus was classified as a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, species Alphacoronavirus-1, together with transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) and feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Carstens, 2010). The genome, 27 kb in length, contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b which encompass the 5 two thirds of the genomic RNA and encode polyproteins leading to the replicase complex. The ORFs, encoding for the structural spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and the non-structural proteins (3a, 3b, 3c, 7a and 7b), are located downstream of the replicase gene (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008).",
