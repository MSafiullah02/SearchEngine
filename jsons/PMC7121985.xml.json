            "text": "In eukaryotes, translation initiation involves recruitment of 40S ribosomal sub units at either the 5\u2032 m7G cap structure or internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). The ribosomal subunit together with other factors locates a start codon and protein synthesis begins following binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit, terminating at a stop codon (1, 2). To fully use their compact genomes, viruses have evolved various mechanisms either to redirect the translational machinery to favor viral transcripts or to regulate the expression of internal genes. Genome partitioning and the use of sgRNAs are common mechanisms used by many plant viruses to make their internal genes accessible for the ribosome (3). In addition, nonorthodox strategies such as the use of internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) elements have been exploited by viruses to express multiple genes from a single RNA species. IRES elements are initially discovered in picornavirus RNAs to confer internal initiation independent of the 5\u2032 end (4, 5). Since then, functional IRES elements have been reported in various viral and cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Cellular mRNAs that contain IRES elements encode a wide variety of proteins such as translation initiation factors, transcription factors, oncogenes, homoeotic genes, and growth factors (6). IRES elements have also been reported in plant viruses such as Tobacco etch virus (TEV) (7) and Crucifer infecting tobamovirus (crTMV) (8, 9).",

An uncapped dicistronic sgRNAl directs the expression of only the MP, while a capped monocistronic sgRNA2 is responsible for the expression of the CP (10). The gRNA of crTMV is able to direct the synthesis of CP in vitro. A 148-nt region preceding the CP of crTMV was tested in a bicistronic construct to contain an IRES element with relatively short and simple structure (8). IRES elements identified in crTMV have been reported to be active in rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (8) and have recently been demonstrated to function in yeast and HeLa cells (11).",

Most of the known viral IRESs are located in 5\u2032 UTRs, highly structured and contain multiple conserved AUGs. Parts of the secondary structure of IRES elements associated with activity include sequences that form part of double-stranded regions (12, 13) or sequences located in apical or internal loops (14, 15). Disruptions of these regions have been associated with the modification of essential RNA-protein interactions (16). The GNRA tetraloop, an example of a conserved motif located at a distal loop in the central domain of Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES, has been indicated to be involved in long range RNA interactions (14). Such RNA-RNA interactions, dependent on RNA concentration, ionic conditions, and temperature (17, 18), suggest dynamism in the tertiary structure of IRES that may play an important role in the IRES activity. Identification and characterization of a putative IRES element can be tested in wheat germ extract, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and mammalian cells.",

The vector can be a pBluescript\u00ae or any suitable plasmid that contains a T7-RNA polymerase promoter so that a full-length sequence containing a putative IRES element can be cloned into it for transcription. The transcribed RNA template can then be used for in vitro translation. A reporter gene (such as green fluorescent protein, GFP) at the 5\u2032 end is used as an internal control for the internal initiation event and the stability of RNA templates during translation.The region containing the IRES element is inserted into a bicistronic construct containing GFP gene as the 5\u2032 cistron and the envelope (E) protein gene of coronavirus Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (21) as the 3\u2032 cistron, giving rise to construct pGFP-IRES-E.A series of sequential deletions of the full-length sequence containing a putative IRES element is carried out to delineate the region responsible for internal initiation. When the expression of the reporter gene is observed to be reduced by several folds, it indicates that the IRES element has been deleted. Construct pGFP-E, containing the GFP gene and the E protein gene in different reading frames, are used as controls (22).Expression of pGFP-E resulted in the detection of GFP. With the insertion of the putative IRES element inserted between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 cistrons, the GFP encoded by the 5\u2032 cistron and the E protein encoded by the 3\u2032 cistron were expressed.To avoid repeated freezing and thawing of the coupled transcription and translation kit.
