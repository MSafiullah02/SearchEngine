Antibiotic reliability is the foundation for modern medicine and has facilitated the development of numerous, formerly impossible, medical procedures. Virtually every aspect of what we call modern medicine: treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies, therapeutic use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant drugs, chemo- and radiation therapy, any and all surgical procedures, burn and wound treatment, to include any procedures or accommodations in which stents, catheters, orthodontic wires, ventilators, staples, sutures, bandages, clamps, belts, implants, or virtually any procedure in which an inert object-biological interface exists; they all put the patient at risk for infection. The development of antibiotic drugs made all this possible. On the other hand, researchers and medical professionals alike continue to struggle with the intensifying issue of antibiotic resistance, especially prominent in healthcare environments, which threatens to collapse the crucial foundation on which modern medicine was built.",

More specifically, many highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria from the ESKAPE group, including P. aeruginosa, are emerging as exceptionally noteworthy pathogens in threatening public health in United States as well as other parts of the world [3]. The ESKAPE bacteria are of tremendous concern because they are responsible for causing the overwhelming majority of nosocomial infections. Several reports identify significant limitations in current treatment options for these pathogens that force medical professionals to settle on the use of previously discontinued drugs having documented toxicity and unclear dosage and administration guidelines [4\u20138]. They also provide complex models of pathogenesis, transmission, and drug resistance [2, 3]. Treatment regimens found to exhibit success against the ESKAPE bacteria can be applied to virtually any other species. Successful treatment of these species alone will result in significantly safer healthcare environments, more suitable for treating disease and illness.",

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to the Gram-negative Gammaproteobacteria class [9] and the Pseudomonadaceae family. Of all the species in the Pseudomonas genus, P. aeruginosa is the most common agent causing infections in humans [10]. It is abundant in the environment in general, and especially copious in the water and wastewater systems [10], making accidental inoculation difficult to avoid. P. aeruginosa infections are implicated in the morbidity and mortality of a wide spectrum of immunocompromised patients [11, 12]. The seriousness of the problem with multiple-drug resistant P. aeruginosa has been highlighted in a recent WHO report, which placed it in the highest global priority \u201ccritical\u201d category, together with A. baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae [13]. In the United States, an estimated 51,000 healthcare-associated P. aeruginosa infections are reported each year [14]. Of these, more than 6000 (13%) are patients infected with multidrug-resistant strains, and approximately 400 deaths per year are attributed to these infections [14]. P. aeruginosa is not only one of the leading pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections [15\u201318], but also causes the morbidity and mortality of oncology and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where it is implicated in more than 90% of the occurrences of respiratory failure [19]. It is also prevalent in the burn units [20, 21], the intensive care units causing ventilator-associated infections [22, 23], and the neonatal intensive care units [24]. P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent isolate in intensive care units (ICUs), accounting for 23% of isolates, and the most common isolate taken from the human respiratory tract, accounting for 32% of isolates [25]. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality responsible for 25% of infections in ICUs [26, 27]. P. aeruginosa-related VAP results in high mortality, ranging from 40% to nearly 70% [28\u201331]. A recent report has also provided evidence that, of all the microbes causing bloodstream infections, P. aeruginosa is the one most commonly associated with mortality [32]. It possesses a significant number of virulence factors that work against the patient\u2019s immune system, making the bacteria highly adaptable and often lethal [33].",

            "text": "Production of a biofilm also contributes to the ability of P. aeruginosa to elude antibiotic treatments and host immune defenses; phagocytosis is frustrated, and antibody penetration is limited [34]. The phenotypic switch to the biofilm mode of growth is governed by gene modulation [35]. Van der Waals forces initially hold planktonic bacterial cells to a surface, where they can then use appendages such as flagella, cilia, or pili as an anchor for stronger adhesion [34]. It has been demonstrated that, during the attachment phase, the genes encoding synthesis of the extracellular matrix are activated [34, 36]. The biofilm mode of growth is characterized, in general, by a reduced bacterial growth rate compared to the planktonic mode, the production of a protective extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) layer, and biofilm-specific gene activation [37]. The EPS layer constitutes a physical barrier, interfering with the ability of therapeutic antibiotic drugs to interact with the bacterial cells and exert their action. It is composed of several polymers as well as DNA; however, it consists primarily of alginate. Production of the alginate EPS by P. aeruginosa was initially discovered in 1966 by Linker and Jones [38]. Alginate is an anionic (negatively charged) co-block polymer composed of \u03b2-d-mannuronic acid (M) and C-5 epimer \u03b1-l-guluronic acid (G) residues attached in a linear fashion by 1\u20134 linkages [36, 39\u201342].",

Biofilms also escalate the severity of infections in the respiratory tract, burns, and other open wounds, as well as virtually any other organ system [59]. The reduced efficacy of therapeutics caused by the presence of biofilm EPS layer serving as a barrier to antibiotic drug penetration limits treatment options even for antibiotic-susceptible strains [60]. In the case of treatment of biofilm infections in the CF respiratory tract, two barriers to drug diffusion exist: the biofilm EPS layer and the thick CF mucus layer (Fig. 1).",

Due to their undisputable antibacterial properties, silver NPs are among the most commonly exploited nanomaterials in commercialized products [100]. Although silver NPs have demonstrated antimicrobial properties against many bacterial species, silver is costly, and is also known to exhibit toxicity in multiple species [101\u2013103], including in vitro cytotoxicity in various human cell lines [100, 104, 105]. Most researchers attribute the observed toxicity either to silver ions [101] or the combination of silver NPs and silver ions [103, 104]. An ideal bactericidal agent should be lethal to bacteria, but safe to human cells. One such candidate is iron and its compounds. Iron-oxide NPs have been shown to be non-toxic [106\u2013109]. For example, feraheme/ferumoxytol containing superparamagnetic iron-oxide NPs was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an iron supplement for treatment of iron deficiency in patients with renal failure [110\u2013112]. According to a previous report, iron-oxide in NP form is not only non-toxic, but its byproduct, degraded iron from the cores, apparently accumulates in natural iron stores in the body [113]. Properly biofunctionalized iron-oxide NPs have been shown to inhibit growth of Staphylococcus aureus [114\u2013116] and Escherichia coli [115, 117], prevent biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa [118] and Streptococcus mutans [119], and exhibit bactericidal activity against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species [120\u2013125]. While these are very encouraging results, more work is necessary in the investigation of iron-oxide NPs as a feasible alternative to silver NPs in the treatment of bacterial infections and for biofilm disruption.",

For example, changing the zeta potential of as-synthesized iron-oxide NPs from negative to positive by coating their surface with biocompatible chitosan has significantly increased their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli, reducing the percentage of viable cells after 22-h exposure to 50 \u00b5M of NP suspension in nutrient broth from over 60% to less than 30% for either bacterial species [124]. Significant documented evidence suggests that the properties of the surface coating may account for the large differences in sensitivity results reported by various groups investigating the antibacterial effects of iron oxide, as the NPs used in the experiments often have different coatings. More research is necessary to thoroughly characterize the effects of surface coating on antibacterial properties.",

Because uncapped iron-oxide NPs are unstable and aggregate at physiological pH of 7.4, they must be coated with a biocompatible polymer [126\u2013128]. The coating must also contain additional, unbound functional groups for conjugation to a drug. For this study, we have opted to cap the NPs with natural alginate, rather than a synthetic polymer, to maintain green methodology and natural reagents. In addition, we anticipated that, since the bacterial biofilm is mostly composed of alginate, which is negatively-charged [129], the alginate-coating will impart a negative charge on iron-oxide NPs. It is well established that capping can be used to alter the surface charge of the iron-oxide NPs [125\u2013128]. In our case, giving the nanocomposites similar negatively charged electrostatic properties to the target environment should promote diffusion through the alginate biofilms.",

Characterization was done using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Tobramycin-conjugated NPs, as well as unconjugated NP samples were used to determine the susceptibilities and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of established P. aeruginosa colonies. All the microbiological procedures were carried out in a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory. The susceptibility to zero-valent iron NPs was also investigated as a positive control. Tobramycin antibiotic was chosen for these studies because it has been shown to be the most active drug tested on clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and has exhibited excellent activity against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, usually in combination with other antibiotics [130\u2013142].",

A typical carboxylic acid has a pKa between 4 and 5 [154], however, titration experiments have shown that oleic acid has a much higher pKa of 9.85 [155]. An organic acid will be significantly deprotonated in a solution if its pKa is two or more units lower than the pH of the solution. Although the reaction would have proceeded at a higher pH, we used an HCl solution having a pH of 1 to ensure a more rapid protonation and thus, detachment of oleate from the iron-oxide NP at 25 \u00b0C. Inserting our pH value of 1 and the oleate pKa of 9.85 into Eq. 1 returns a value of 6974.3 for the ratio [HA]/[A\u2212]. Upon reaching this pH, the yellow-tinged transparent oleic acid could be visually observed to fall out of solution. The NPs were separated in a 95% hexanes/methanol mixture, in which the methanol solvated the oleic acid.",

Septa were placed on the other two flask necks, with a nitrogen adaptor on the central neck to purge with nitrogen. To keep a sealed pyridine bottle under close to atmospheric pressure, 25 mL of nitrogen gas were drawn up into a syringe through the septum of a nitrogen-filled three-neck flask connected to the Schlenk line and injected into the pyridine bottle. After injection, 25 mL of anhydrous pyridine were drawn up from the bottle and injected into the nitrogen-filled flask. The temperature controller was set to 50 \u00b0C, the temperature at which the solid mPEG dissolves. Subsequently, 2.5 g of succinic anhydride were added to the three-neck flask. This reaction process lasted for 1 h at 50 \u00b0C. The addition of pyridine was repeated four more times using the same methodology as described above, and the reaction could continue for another 2 h at 50 \u00b0C. The pyridine solvent, which has a boiling point of 115.3 \u00b0C at 1 atm, was removed using the rotary evaporator set at 40\u201350 \u00b0C to facilitate evaporation separation of the solvent. The evaporation procedure was followed by three DI water washes. The product was then re-dissolved in DI water and placed in 1-kDa-cutoff dialysis tubing in a 1-L beaker filled with DI water. The succinylated 5-kDa PEG was trapped inside, while the lighter precursor materials could diffuse out of the bag into the surrounding fluid (dialyte). The DI water in the 1-L beaker was replaced after 2, 4, and 8 h. Figure 2 shows the purification through dialysis with 1-kDa dialysis bags. After dialysis purification, the mixture was dried with the rotary evaporator, with the water bath set to 50 \u00b0C, the same as the synthesis temperature. The dried succinylated PEG was still liquid at this temperature and turned into a light-brown waxy solid when cooled to room temperature. After succinylation, PEG capping was performed using a modified procedure from [164]. For our work, we only used the succinylated PEG, prepared from mPEG as described above, as opposed to the costlier phospholipids with PEG tails used in [164].",

            "text": "Drug conjugation to tobramycin was done using EDC with sulfo-NHS. Sulfo-NHS is a chemical modification reagent used in the conversion of carboxyl groups to amine-reactive esters in bioconjugation or crosslinking. Sulfo-NHS is a charged analog of NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) and, like NHS, facilitates control and alteration of carbodiimide crosslinking reactions in which carboxylates (\u2013COOH), such as those present in the polymer molecule, are activated for conjugation with primary amines (\u2013NH2) found on the tobramycin molecule. Such derivatives are synthesized by mixing the sulfo-NHS with a carboxyl-containing molecule, such as alginate, citrate, or carboxy-PEG, with a dehydrating agent such as the carbodiimide EDC. EDC is a \u201czero-length cross-linker\u201d, meaning that it acts by bringing the two molecules of interest together, but does not change their combined size by increasing the polymer chain length. In the first step of the reaction, the carboxylated particles are activated by addition of the EDC, followed by the formation of a reactive ester intermediate, O-acylisourea. After that, the ester will react with an amine group forming an amide. However, this amide is highly unstable and will hydrolyze, regenerating the carboxyl group, if it does not encounter another amine functional group. Our procedure was modified for our purposes from a generic procedure for EDC crosslinking of carboxyl and amine terminal functional groups [165]. To conjugate the NPs capped with any of the above-mentioned organic molecules or polymers, 100 mg of Fe3O4 NPs washed three times with 10 mL of coupling buffer (50 mM phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2) were removed by magnetic separation. The purified NPs were then suspended in 5 mL of coupling buffer. To ensure an excess of the ligand, 50 mg of tobramycin (50 mg of tobramycin per 100 mg of NPs) were dissolved in coupling buffer, thus making a 10 mg/mL tobramycin solution. Under gentle stirring, the NP solution was added drop-wise into a beaker containing the tobramycin solution, and allowed to sit for 2 min at 450 rpm. 100 mg of EDC for each 100 mg of NPs were added to the reaction mixture, under stirring until solvated. Then, 5 mM sulfo-NHS was also added to the reaction vessel. The conjugation reaction could proceed for 4 h at room temperature under gentle stirring. Afterwards, the NPs were washed twice with 5 mL of coupling buffer, before being resuspended in coupling buffer containing 35 mM Tris to block excess reactive sites. Finally, the NPs were washed twice again, suspended in DI water, and stored in the refrigerator. Conjugation to tobramycin was confirmed with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy done on EDC-crosslinked NP-tobramycin nanocomposites in KBr pellets.",

Although the zeta potential measurement is often regarded as NP surface charge, it is not actually a measure of surface charge. Zeta potential measures the potential difference between the dispersion medium and the adsorbed layer of solvent ions surrounding the particle. This is not equal to the surface charge or the Stern potential [166], which are defined at a different location. Colloids with a zeta potential between -10 and +10 mV are considered neutral, while colloids with a zeta potential greater than 30 mV or smaller than -30 mV are considered strongly cationic, or anionic, respectively [167]. Particles with a large measured value of zeta potential, whether negative or positive, are electrostatically stabilized, whereas particles with low absolute values of zeta potential aggregate or flocculate [167\u2013169]. According to Liao et al. [170], iron-oxide NPs in water had a zeta potential of +16.1 mV (incipient stability), which shifted to \u2212 60.1 mV (good\u2013excellent stability) after capping with alginate. Because most cell membranes are negatively charged, zeta potential is a key parameter in membrane permeability, and cationic particles tend to exhibit toxicity associated with membrane disruption (lysis) [167]. In our case, the alginate coating will impart the nanocomposites similar negatively charged electrostatic properties to the target membrane and biofilm environment, which should promote diffusion through the alginate biofilms, while also imparting the colloid significant stability at physiological pH.",

The disks, impregnated with NPs, drug, or NP-drug conjugates were then placed on top of the agar. A previous method of impregnation, the dip method, in which dry disks were dipped into known concentrations by forceps and then placed onto the agar cultures was found to produce inconsistent results because it was shown that the disks can absorb different amounts of liquid, introducing variability in the absorbed concentrations [179]. Instead, the more accurate drop method described by Sabath [180] was used. In this method, the dry disks are placed on the agar plates, then a known volume. The dry disks were placed atop the cultures and a 0.1 \u03bcL drop of the solution of interest at the desired concentration was applied to the disk using a micropipette calibrated micropipette. This method eliminates variability in the total absorbed amount since a known volume is applied. Disk concentrations of tobramycin were initiated at the CLSI recommended disk content for tobramycin, corresponding to 10 \u03bcg absorbed into the disk, when this mass returned a negative susceptibility, the concentrations were increased incrementally, until a susceptible mass was determined. For the initial disk diffusion study investigating tobramycin, NPs, and NP-conjugates, the mass on the disk was determined from concentration and applied volume. For example, a 0.1 \u03bcL aliquot of a solution having a concentration of 100 mg/mL corresponds to 10 \u03bcg in the disk (0.1 \u03bcL*100 mg/1 mL = 10 \u03bcg), a 50 mg/mL concentration corresponds to 5 \u03bcg in the disk (0.1 \u03bcL*100 mg/1 mL = 5 \u03bcg), and a 25 mg/mL concentration corresponds to 2.5 \u03bcg in the disk (0.1 \u03bcL*25 mg/1 mL = 2.5 \u03bcg), and so on. All doses based on concentration or weight correspond to the total nanocomposite, not to NPs, PEG, or tobramycin alone. The cultures were grown under the previous conditions overnight (16\u201318 h) at 37 \u00b0C. The diameter of zone of inhibition around the disc was observed and recorded.

Superparamagnetic behavior of the Fe16N2 NP samples was confirmed in magnetic hysteresis measurements. Consistent with the results of DC magnetization measurements, magnetic hysteresis measurements at 293 K performed on Fe16N2 NPs found no coercivity.

Disk diffusion results for tobramycin were interpreted based on the 2019 CLSI breakpoints for tobramycin in P. aeruginosa [178], in which the mass of tobramycin on the disk is 10 \u00b5g and a disk diameter of \u2265 15 mm is susceptible (S), 13\u201314 mm is intermediate (I) and \u2264 12 mm is resistant (R). Since there exist no standards for the investigation of iron oxide nanoparticle susceptibility in any microbes, we used the same cutoff values as for tobramycin in order to maintain consistency. We also investigated a range of concentrations of tobramycin, NPs, and NP-conjugates in order to determine susceptibility range. Over time, the disk diffusion results (Table 3), taken together with the MIC results, demonstrate that the tobramycin susceptibility decreases and resistance increases as the colonies are allowed to grow in biofilm mode for longer periods of time, despite being tobramycin na\u00efve. Therefore, this is not due to exposure-related resistance development. It is important to note that the observed increase in resistance is not due to a larger initial amount of CFU\u2019s in the 60-day old biofilms, because cultures were diluted and identical concentrations of CFUs were used for inoculation and plating for all time periods. These findings suggest that the age of the infection alone (i.e., establishment of a chronic infection) contributes to resistance. This is possibly due to broader genetic diversity in the population. No comparable increase in resistance over time was observed for the NP samples investigated, suggesting that a genetic resistance mechanism to counter the action of the compound may not exist. We can speculate that the mechanism of action of the iron-oxide NPs is not based on inhibition of genes or bacterial protein synthesis, which implies the toxicity may not be prokaryote-specific.",

This group also reported that planktonic cells taken from the same strain was completely killed by only 50 \u03bcg/mL. Another relevant study reports the MIC from their clinical isolates to be 8 \u03bcg/mL [130]. These published findings suggest a huge theoretical therapeutic dose ranging from 8 to more than 1000 \u03bcg/mL.

For this study, 50 mg/mL concentrations of NPs and NP-conjugate solution were applied to the disk, such that each disk contained 50 \u00b5g of test article. The results without (Table 4) and with (Table 5) magnetic field application demonstrate zero susceptibility to tobramycin alone. No CLSI breakpoints exist for NPs or NP conjugates at present, however, the CLSI cutoff values for determination of P. aeruginosa susceptibility to tobramycin with 10 \u03bcg absorbed onto a disk are \u2265 15 susceptible, 13\u201314 intermediate, and \u2264 12 resistant [178]. The same parameters were used for interpretation of the NP and NP-conjugate results. Tables 4 and 5 demonstrate the highly statistically significant contribution of the external magnetic field in enhancing susceptibility to the test articles. More work is needed to determine the exact role of the magnetic field in addition to determining the minimum or maximum field strength necessary to achieve maximum susceptibility. It is possible that the pulling force of the magnet may relate in some way to the thickness of the biofilm and mucus barriers.",

OD600 was determined against a blank cuvette, containing broth only. The OD600 of the negative control samples (containing only inoculated broth) was determined to be 0.22 to 0.24. This result is slightly higher than the lowest treatment concentration (8 \u00d7 10\u22126 mg/mL). Due to the lack of prior art suggesting an inhibitory concentration, it was necessary to investigate a large range of concentrations to determine MIC. The range used was 17.35 mg/mL to 8 \u00d7 10\u22126 mg/mL, in a consistent volume, determined by serial dilution, as the graph in Fig. 16 illustrates. Complete inhibition was observed for all materials at concentrations at 17.5 mg/mL (or higher), and various degrees of inhibition fall off somewhat linearly at concentrations below 17.35 mg/mL (Fig. 16). The inhibition by zero-valent iron was, not surprisingly, higher than iron-oxide NPs and NP-drug conjugates. We attribute this to the high reactivity of zero-valent iron and its ability to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the local region [182]. Although speculative at this stage, it is also possible that high levels of iron contribute to cellular toxicity. More work is necessary to determine toxic and non-toxic dose ranges.",

Figure 17 shows that the inhibition of bacterial cells was evident even at surprisingly low (8 ng/mL) concentrations, although the minimum therapeutic dose would probably be much higher; the range in which more significant bacterial inhibition was observed. Speculation on a therapeutic dose for targeted delivery would likely differ from the systemic dose, and both will depend on observed cytotoxicity in mammalian cell cultures, at these concentrations.

Although zero-valent iron is too reactive for in vivo use at present, it may be a candidate for incorporation into antibacterial coatings. Similarly, iron-oxide NPs having high biocompatibility, may be a candidate material for incorporation into polymer for use as antibacterial coatings on virtually any inert surface used outside of the body, as well as medical devices such as stents, catheters, and surgical sutures as a low-cost alternative to silver NPs. We anticipate that the combination of tobramycin or other drugs with iron-oxide NPs incorporated into biodegradable polymers may hold promise for the long-term control of biofilms and multidrug resistant microbial strains.

For example, H2O2 could penetrate the cell membrane of the bacteria and kill the bacteria by entering the intracellular space. It appears that a destructive consequence appears under of greater concentrations of zero-valent iron and consequently, ROS induced by the presence of iron. Experimentation to determine the bactericidal effects of zero-valent iron and the theoretical mechanisms leading to cell death has been done previously, and the established findings may be referenced in any of the following notable publications. The first of which reports significant disruption of the Escherichia coli cell membrane by zero-valent iron NPs suggesting inactivation or enhanced the biocidal effects of dissolved iron as well as oxidative stress as mechanisms of cell death [192]. Another report, [193], investigated the use of zero-valent iron NPs against Gram negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis showing that B. subtilis was more tolerant to zero-valent iron NPs than E. coli, but states that the bactericidal mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Despite these findings, there is not yet a consensus in the literature regarding this effect; another paper published elsewhere claims that zero-valent iron had no deleterious effect on total bacterial abundance in the microcosms. This paper reports that zero-valent iron with a biodegradable polyaspartate cap increased bacterial populations by an order of magnitude relative to controls [194]. Perhaps, upon reaching stable oxidation equilibrium in the body, this material will benefit bacterial populations by providing beneficial doses of iron.",

However, if this is occurring, it is not happening on a large scale since no statistically significant difference in the MIC or susceptibility was noted in tobramycin conjugated iron-oxide NPs compared to unconjugated NPs. However, more work is needed to clarify the antibacterial mechanism(s) of action of iron-oxide NPs alone and in combination with the aminoglycoside, or other antibiotic drugs, and to clarify the overall role of the capping agent.",

Since uncapped iron-oxide NPs (~ 16 nm) had similar antibacterial effects as the alginate-capped and alginate-capped/tobramycin conjugated NPs (~ 200 nm), whereas the PEG-capped NPs (~ 40 nm) were ineffective, we do not attribute these findings to size effects.

The NPs investigated in this study have an average hydrodynamic diameter of 16 nm, prior to capping with natural alginate. The NP-drug conjugates were prepared using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (EDC/sulfo-NHS) crosslinking of the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin with alginate, by way of carboxyl and amine functional groups. Bacterial biofilm cultures were grown for 60 days to more closely model an established infection. We also investigated an in vitro CF model, in which a magnetic gradient was applied to NP-drug conjugates atop an artificial biofilm (alginate layer) and mucus layer on agar. Positive inhibition of bacterial growth was observed for uncapped and alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs, and the corresponding MICs have been presented. We have observed zero susceptibility to iron-oxide NPs capped with PEG, suggesting that the capping agent plays a major role in enabling bactericidal ability in of the nanocomposite. Our findings suggest that the alginate-coated nanocomposites investigated in this study have the potential to overcome the bacterial biofilm barrier, possibly by simple diffusion, due to the favorable solubility of the alginate-coated NPs within the alginate biofilm. Magnetic field application increases the action, likely via enhanced diffusion of the iron-oxide NPs and NP-drug conjugates through mucin and alginate barriers, which are characteristic of CF respiratory infections. We have demonstrated that iron-oxide NPs coated with alginate, as well as alginate-coated magnetite\u2014tobramycin conjugates inhibit P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation in established colonies, which are often the most difficult to treat. We have also determined that susceptibility to tobramycin decreases for longer culture times, as the colonies are allowed to differentiate for longer periods of time. In contrast, susceptibility to the iron-oxide NP compounds did not demonstrate any comparable decrease with increasing culture time. These findings appear to imply that iron-oxide NPs are promising lower-cost alternatives to silver NPs in antibacterial coatings, solutions, and drugs, as well as other applications in which microbial abolition or infestation prevention is sought. Future work should include multiple strains of P. aeruginosa in order to determine to what extend the response may be strain-dependent, as well as detailed investigations into the mechanism(s) of action.",
