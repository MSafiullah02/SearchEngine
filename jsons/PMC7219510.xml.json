Most of the time such systems reside in the vicinity of some attractor, undergoing small random excursions around it. Yet, occasionally a rare large fluctuation, on the order of the typical system size, may occur, which can lead to a transition to an absorbing state (a state that, once entered, cannot be left) or to the vicinity of another attractor. As a result, stochasticity can turn deterministically stable attractors into metastable states [1]. Examples of such extreme, rare events, which may be of key practical importance include population extinction [2\u20136], switching in gene regulatory networks [7\u201310], the arrival of biomolecules at small cellular receptors [11], and power-grid destabilization [12\u201314].",

In this case, analytical treatment is possible using standard techniques [6,9,15]. On the other hand, it is known that in topologically heterogeneous networks, e.g., where nodes have a variable degree, the critical behavior can be dramatically affected [16\u201319]. Unfortunately, predicting rare events in degree-heterogenous networks is notoriously difficult, due to high dimensionality and complex coupling between degrees of freedom. Though some progress has been made by applying semiclassical approximations to master equations governing stochastic dynamics in complex systems [20\u201322], often the resulting Hamilton equations are difficult to solve, as they require computing unstable trajectories in high-dimensional phase spaces [23\u201326]. Consequently, analyzing rare events in general networks has been mainly limited to near-bifurcation regimes, where dimensionality is reduced.",

Our approach is shown analytically for two canonical examples of fluctuation-driven rare events: extinction of epidemics in the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on networks, and switching (or spontaneous magnetization flipping) in binary spin networks.",

A transcritical bifurcation occurs as \u039b passes the value of 1. While it gives some intuition, the deterministic picture ignores demographic noise emanating from the discreteness of individuals and stochasticity of the reactions. This noise, and the fact that the extinct state n1=n2=0 is absorbing, make the nontrivial stable fixed point in the language of the rate equations, metastable. Thus, the network ultimately goes extinct via a rare, large fluctuation [4,6,30\u201332].",

Next, we assume that the network settles into a long-lived metastable state prior to extinction. This assumption is justified if N is large, and the mean time to extinction (MTE), T, is very long. This metastable state, which is described by a quasistationary distribution (QSD) about the stable fixed point, slowly decays in time at a rate which equals 1/T, while simultaneously the extinction probability grows and reaches the value of 1 at infinite time [1,4]. We now plug the ansatz Pn1,n2\u2243\u03c0n1,n2e-t/T into master equation (3), where \u03c0n1,n2 is the QSD, and employ the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for the QSD, \u03c0n1,n2\u2261\u03c0(x1,x2)\u223ce-NS(x1,x2), where S(x1,x2) is the action function [1].

            "text": "Given our analysis for bimodal networks, it is straightforward to generalize to arbitrary, symmetric degree distributions, first, and then to skewed distributions. Let us denote by g(k) the node degree distribution. That is, if Nk are the number of nodes of degree k such that \u2211kNk=N, we have g(k)=Nk/N. We assume that g(k) is a symmetric distribution about the mean k0\u2261\u27e8k\u27e9, such that g(k0+i)=g(k0-i) for i=1,2,3,\u2026. Let us also assume our distribution has a bounded support such that kmin=k0-\u0394 and kmax=k0+\u0394, where g(k<kmin)=g(k>kmax)=0. We again denote by nk the number of infected individuals on degree-k nodes, and by xk=[1/g(k)]nk/N=nk/Nk the fraction of such infected individuals. Writing down the master equation for P{nk}\u2014the joint probability to find (nkmin,\u2026,nkmax) infected nodes of degree k, and using the above WKB formalism, P(x)\u223ce-NS(x), where x=(xkmin,\u2026,xkmax), we arrive at a Hamiltonian equivalent to [21]. Denoting g(k)pk=\u2202S/\u2202xx, the action can be shown to satisfy [33]\nS(0)=\u2211k=k0-\u0394k0+\u0394g(k)\u222bpkdxk=g(k0)\u222bpk0dxk0+\u2211j=1\u0394g(k0-j)\u222bpk0-jdxk0-j+pk0+jdxk0+j,(8)where we have used the symmetry of g(k) about its mean k0. Now, since each pair of nodes k0\u00b1j for j\u2208[1,\u0394] can be viewed as a bimodal network, using Eqs. (6) and (7), the action for such a bimodal network with degrees k0-j and k0+j, satisfies (1/2)\u222bpk0-jdxk0-j+pk0+jdxk0+j=S0-fE(\u039b)\u03b5j2, where \u03b5j=j/k0. Moreover, the node of rank k0 can be viewed as a bimodal network with \u03b5j=0, such that \u222bpk0dxk0=S0. Therefore, using the fact that \u2211kg(k)=1 and that the variance of g(k) satisfies \u03c32=\u2211k(k-k0)2g(k), the action [Eq. (8)] and MTE become T\u223ceNS(0),  S(0)=S0-fE(\u039b)\u03c32/\u27e8k\u27e92.(9)",

As a consequence, the deterministic trajectory starting from the vicinity of the unstable point 0 and ending at the stable fixed point x* coincides up to time reversal, with the fluctuational path from x* to 0 [1].

We computed the rate of increase of rare events, and showed that it depends solely on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the network\u2019s degree distribution, but is independent of the exact type of network and connectivity matrix. A key insight therein, was to compare different networks with the same distance to threshold, such that deterministic or fluctuation-free stability was held constant, while propensities for noise-induced fluctuations could be isolated. We found that the rate of extinction or switching can be dramatically increased, as long as the CV of the network\u2019s degree distribution exceeds N-1/2, which is a reasonable assumption for realistic networks. Finally, we have shown that our approach is valid in processes with maintained as well as broken detailed balance, holds across a broad range of network topologies, and generalizes to different noise sources [33]. Thus, we conjecture that our results are applicable to rare events in a wider range of network processes driven by noise, which include local interactions, and where fluctuations drive a network from a metastable state to an unstable state who merge in a single fixed-point bifurcation [33].",

This is repeated for 20 different network realizations with the same degree distribution and the same number of edges. The log of all such averages is then averaged. Error bars are given by the standard deviation of the latter. Results are shown for uniform (green, \u039b=1.16, N=1500, \u27e8k\u27e9=50), Gaussian (red, \u039b=1.24, N=600, \u27e8k\u27e9=108.5), and Gamma (magenta, \u039b=1.26, N=500, \u27e8k\u27e9=110.4) distributions. Note that each distribution has one tunable parameter for the variance given a fixed \u27e8k\u27e9. Right panel: MTE versus the threshold parameter \u039b. Results are shown for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks (green, N=600, \u27e8k\u27e9=160, \u03c3/\u27e8k\u27e9=0.067) and (magenta, N=300, \u27e8k\u27e9=120, \u03c3/\u27e8k\u27e9=0.072), and Gaussian distributions (red, N=400, \u27e8k\u27e9=110.4, \u03c3/\u27e8k\u27e9=0.064). The MTEs and error bars were computed through the same procedure as in the left panel.",
