            "text": "In man, viral infections causing respiratory disease have been known for many years. Every now and then such viruses may cause epidemics involving large groups of people or even pandemics with worldwide spread. At the end of the last century and at the beginning of this century zoonotic viruses emerged that were of serious risk for the human population: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (CoV), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 and pandemic influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1). Both SARS-CoV and influenza A viruses cause respiratory disease that may lead to severe and even fatal cases of pneumonia. The course and outcome of these infections are related to their pathogenesis, which can be explored by describing and comparing pathology, virology and genomics. Understanding the pathogenesis of SARS and influenza is valuable for development of therapeutic and preventive strategies. Since the pathology of acute human fatal cases of SARS and influenza is rarely described, there is a need for animal models to provide information about the early stages of the disease. Additionally, pathological descriptions of human cases with uncomplicated viral pneumonia are sparse because patients have multiple therapeutic interventions and secondary co-infections that may alter the pathology. This review focuses on the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and influenza A virus infections, not only comparing the two viruses, but also comparing the pathology of these virus infections in experimental animals to that in man (van den Brand, 2013).",

Masked palm civet cats and raccoon dogs, which are kept and sold at so-called Chinese wet-markets (markets selling live poultry, fish and exotic animals for human consumption), have provided transmission of the virus to man (Guan et al., 2003, Webster, 2004). In 2005, horseshoe bats were identified as a natural reservoir for a group of coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV with approximately 88\u201392% homology by genome sequences (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005b). SARS is spread by close person-to-person contact through droplet transmission or excretions (Peiris et al., 2003b), as was demonstrated in a hospital where virus spread due to over-crowding and poor ventilation (Wong et al., 2005), and later also by airborne transmission in a private residential complex in Hong Kong (Yu et al., 2005).",

The histopathology of SARS is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The stage of DAD is related to the duration of the illness and may be divided into an exudative phase, a proliferative phase and a fibrotic phase. Patients in the initial 10 days of the disease demonstrate an exudative phase, with necrosis of alveolar epithelial cells, intraluminal oedema, fibrin exudation, hyaline membrane formation, haemorrhage and infiltrates with inflammatory cells such as monocytes or macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils into the alveolar wall and lumina (Ding et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2003, Hsueh et al., 2004, Shieh et al., 2005). There is necrosis of the bronchiolar and bronchial epithelium with infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils into the bronchial wall (Ding et al., 2003, Franks et al., 2003). In the proliferative phase, after 10\u201314 days, there is less epithelial damage with interstitial and alveolar fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and regeneration that is characterized by type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Franks et al., 2003, Cheung et al., 2004, Shieh et al., 2005, He et al., 2006). Large multinucleated cells composed of macrophages or pneumocytes are frequently observed and atypical enlarged pneumocytes with large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli are seen (Franks et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2003, Tse et al., 2004). In the fibrotic phase after 14 days interstitial thickening is described with mild to moderate fibrosis and BOOP-like pattern and only few inflammatory cells (mainly histiocytes and lymphocytes) (Cheung et al., 2004, Tse et al., 2004). Other features are haemophagocytosis, squamous metaplasia (Nicholls et al., 2003) and fibrin thrombi in vessels (Ding et al., 2003).",

The severity of the lesions in aged cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV is more extensive than in young-adult macaques, including severe oedema with hyaline membrane formation and syncytia (Smits et al., 2010) (Fig. 1\n). Young-adult AGMs develop more severe lesions from SARS-CoV infection than young-adult cynomolgus macaques (Fouchier et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003a, McAuliffe et al., 2004, Smits et al., 2011). By gross pathology, the percentage of affected lung tissue is higher in AGMs than in cynomolgus macaques and is characterized by multifocal consolidation. By histopathology, there is acute exudative DAD characterized by necrosis of alveolar epithelium, moderate multifocal hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, variable intraluminal oedema and exudate sometimes with hyaline membrane formation, mild multifocal necrosis and regeneration of bronchiolar epithelium, and sometimes intraluminal syncytial cells or mild multifocal tracheobronchoadenitis (inflammation of the submucosal glands of the trachea and bronchi). These pulmonary lesions are significantly more severe in young-adult AGMs than in young-adult cynomolgus macaques. However, the character of the pulmonary lesions is similar, except that young-adult AGMs show hyaline membranes and young-adult cynomolgus macaques do not (Table 1\n).",

Additionally, AGMs, young-adult macaques and cats have lesions in the submucosal glands of trachea and bronchi that are not seen in man. Secondly, the character of the lesions is similar among all species; these characteristics are epithelial necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Additionally, syncytia and hyaline membranes are present in lesions of man, aged macaques and AGMs. Thirdly, the severity of the lesions among species can be divided into two groups.

Firstly, there is irreversible damage to the pneumocytes, which therefore fail to re-epithelialize the alveolar walls. Instead, the denuded basement membrane is repaired by fibrosis. Secondly, there may be a specific epithelial sensitivity to interferon (IFN)-\u03b3: lung epithelial cells are more responsive to IFN-\u03b3-induced damage than fibroblasts during SARS-CoV infection. Thirdly, there may be a T-helper (Th)1-dominant immune-mediated cell death, which may favour the damage to infected alveolar epithelial cells over damage to non-infected fibroblasts, leaving the latter relatively intact. This would mean destruction of the epithelial layer, a basis for stimulation of fibroblasts for repair (Theron et al., 2005). Fourthly, there may be Fas-mediated apoptosis of human epithelial cells, while lung fibroblasts are protected and are also not infected by SARS-CoV (Coulter et al., 2002, Tanaka et al., 2002). The importance of the previously-mentioned factors for fibrosis in SARS is not clear and needs further investigation.",

Furthermore, one should realize that most pathological descriptions of human SARS involve people who have been hospitalized for an extended period and have undergone multiple interventions; there are only a limited number of descriptions of acute fatal human cases without intervention. In contrast, animals that have been infected experimentally with SARS-CoV usually do not undergo intervention and are killed before the endpoint of severe disease. Finally, one should consider that only about 10% of people with confirmed SARS-CoV infection die (Peiris et al., 2003b) and it is likely that many people who recovered from SARS had less severe respiratory tract lesions.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV enters the body via the respiratory system by droplet transmission and interacts with cellular receptors via the surface spike protein (S-protein) to infect target cells (Simmons et al., 2004). Several host cell receptors have been found to bind to the S-protein. One is metallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Others are lectins: C-type lectin DC-SIGN (or CD209), human CD209L (or liver/lymph node specific (L)-SIGN and DC-SIGNR) and LSECtin (Li et al., 2003, Jeffers et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004a, Gramberg et al., 2005). Binding of the S-protein to the main functional receptor ACE2 on the target cell leads to fusion between the virus envelope and the host cell membrane. SARS-CoV infection of ACE2-expressing cells seems to be dependent on the lysosomal proteolytic enzyme cathepsin L that is present in various cell types (Simmons et al., 2005, Huang et al., 2006b). ACE2 in man is present in type I and II pneumocytes, small intestinal enterocytes, the brush border of proximal tubular cells of the kidneys, endothelial cells of small and large arteries and veins, and arterial smooth muscle cells (Hamming et al., 2004). DC-SIGN (or CD209) is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages. The low expression of cathepsin L in human endothelial cells might explain the low infection rate of these cells despite their high expression of ACE2 (Huang et al., 2006a). On the other hand, virus replication was observed in colonic epithelial cells and in hepatocytes without ACE2 expression, which may be explained by the presence of other receptors and co-receptors like dendritic cell-specific DC-SIGN and human CD209L (Lau and Peiris, 2005). Binding of SARS-CoV to this receptor did not lead to entry of virus into dendritic cells, but facilitated transfer of viruses to other susceptible cells (Yang et al., 2004a). CD209L acted in conjunction with LSECtin to enhance SARS-CoV infection (Jeffers et al., 2004).",

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in-situ hybridization (ISH) studies demonstrate virus antigen or viral nucleic acid in alveolar, bronchiolar, bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and multinucleated cells (To and Lo, 2004, Shieh et al., 2005). Co-labelling for cytokeratin and surfactant shows that the infected cells are mostly pneumocytes, predominantly type II pneumocytes (Shieh et al., 2005). Type II pneumocytes secrete surfactant, which is involved in reduction of the surface tension and integrity of the alveolar lumen, and they are important in tissue restitution and differentiation into type I pneumocytes. In extrarespiratory tissues, SARS-CoV RNA is detected in small and large intestine, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, adrenal gland and cerebrum, suggesting that SARS has extra-pulmonary dissemination leading to virus excretion in respiratory secretions, stools, urine and possibly sweat (Leung et al., 2003, Ding et al., 2004, Farcas et al., 2005).",

The epithelial damage can partly be explained by the direct cytopathic effect and apoptotic mechanisms due to viral infection and replication, resulting in lysis of the infected cells and inflammation in the infected tissue (Ng et al., 2003, Zhou et al., 2006).

In SARS patients, the results of cytokine and chemokine measurements are difficult to interpret due to many confounding factors. However, the levels of both cytokines and chemokines in the blood are elevated: interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 (or CC-motif ligand 2, CCL2), monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 (MIG), IFN-inducible protein (IP-10 or chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 10, CXCL10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (Wong et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2005, Baas et al., 2008). Increased expression of chemokines and cytokines such as IP-10, MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-8 are important for chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils and monocytes (Ware and Matthay, 2000, Fan et al., 2001, Tsushima et al., 2009). Infiltration of these inflammatory cells corresponds with the severe pulmonary lesions observed in human cases (Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2005, Cameron et al., 2007, Smits et al., 2010).",

Similar to human ACE2, both ferret and feline ACE2 bind the attaching S-protein of SARS-CoV efficiently (Zamoto et al., 2006, Guo et al., 2008). However, cell tropism and ACE2 expression do not always correspond. For example, ferret bronchiolar epithelial cells express ACE2, but are apparently not infected by SARS-CoV (Table 1). This discrepancy may be explained by the necessity for other receptors besides ACE2 for virus attachment or for other factors (such as cathepsin L) for SARS-CoV replication in the host cell (Gramberg et al., 2005).",

While the submucosal glands of both cats and ferrets expressed ACE2, only the submucosal glands of cats became infected and inflamed. As indicated above, this discrepancy may be due to species differences in expression of other co-factors necessary for viral replication. Alternatively, this discrepancy may also be due to species differences in the histological architecture of the tracheobronchial submucosal glands, which contain both serous and mucous cells. Ferrets have relatively more mucous cells than cats. This may have inhibited the attachment of SARS-CoV to serous cells, which was the main cell type infected in cats.",

The cytokine response in SARS is probably host specific since aged macaques had a stronger up-regulation of those chemokines and cytokines than young-adult macaques, despite similar virus replication (Smits et al., 2010). When up-regulated chemokines and cytokines of macaques and AGMs were compared, IP-10, MCP-1, CXCL-1, CXCL2, IL-6 and IL-8 were up-regulated in macaques, but not in AGMs. However, despite similar virus replication levels, the young-adult AGMs showed more severe lesions with hyaline membranes when compared with the young-adult macaques. Comparative gene expression analyses revealed induction of proinflammatory and antiviral pathways in both species. Cytokines important for ARDS or neutrophils attracting activity, such as CXCL-1, CXCL2, IL-6 and IL-8, were up-regulated in the macaques, but not in the AGMs. Other proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as SPP1 (osteopontin), CCL20 and CCL3 were up-regulated more in AGMs than in macaques. Additionally, osteopontin and CCL20 were significantly more up-regulated in AGMs and aged macaques than in young-adult macaques. Osteopontin is expressed predominantly by macrophages and is important in type 1 (Th1) cytokine expression and plays a role in development of lung fibrosis (O'Regan, 2003, Pardo et al., 2005). In AGMs, many macrophages, presumed to express osteopontin, were seen histologically, while in macaques there were both macrophages and neutrophils. The above-mentioned differences in the gene expression profile as well as the difference in the tropism, which also involves bronchiolar and tracheal epithelial cells in AGMs (Table 1), help to explain the more severe lesions in the AGMs.",

The cell type tropism as described in virus-specific factors by the distribution of ACE2 may result in differences in the severity of the disease between animal models and man. Additionally, the difference in the outcome of the disease between AGMs and cynomolgus macaques indicates that there may be more differences in the reaction of the immune response between the species. These differences may be related to evolutionary adaptations and differences in selection of major histocompatibility complexes, immune response, cytokine production and sensitivity to viruses. Co-morbidities and genetic factors that are associated with severe disease in man have not been investigated in laboratory animals and thus an insight into those factors from SARS animal models has not been obtained.",

Aged cynomolgus macaques (10\u201319 years old) infected with SARS-CoV had more severe lesions than young-adult animals (3\u20135 years old), even though viral replication levels were similar (Imai et al., 2008, Smits et al., 2010, Rockx et al., 2011). Additionally, aged mice showed more severe lesions than young-adult mice on infection with SARS-CoV and the transcription profile in aged mice generally indicated a stronger proinflammatory response than in young mice (Baas et al., 2008, Rockx et al., 2009). It is suggested that age-related accumulated oxidative damage and a weakened anti-oxidative defence system cause a disturbance in the redox balance, resulting in increased reacting oxygen species (Smits et al., 2010). Subsequently, redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, can be activated, which is followed by the induction of proinflammatory genes such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and adhesion molecules (Chung et al., 2006). Therefore, ageing is not only associated with alterations in the adaptive immune response, but also with a proinflammatory state in the host (Smits et al., 2010). Oxidative stress and Toll-like signalling, via NF-\u03baB triggered by viral pathogens like SARS-CoV, may further amplify the host response, ultimately leading to acute lung injury (Imai et al., 2008).",

Today, human influenza occurs yearly as seasonal influenza, mainly in the winter months of temperate climates, every year as interpandemic epidemics, and, sporadically at an average of 35 year intervals, as more severe influenza (i.e. pandemics). Seasonal influenza and interpandemic epidemics occur as a result of mutations in influenza viruses that are circulating in the human population (antigenic drift). In contrast, influenza pandemics occur as a result of the introduction of an animal influenza virus or a human\u2013animal influenza reassortant virus in which the surface glycoprotein haemagglutinin, with or without other virus proteins, substantially differs antigenically from those circulating in the human population (antigenic shift) (Cox and Subbarao, 2000).",

Avian influenza virus can be of high or low pathogenicity (HPAI or LPAI) based on the pathogenicity for chickens. During human infection, human influenza viruses use host trypsin-like proteases in the respiratory tract to cleave HA, while LPAI viruses replicate in both the respiratory and the digestive tracts of birds (WHO, 2004). HPAI viruses use a wide range of proteases allowing replication outside the respiratory tract in chickens (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2001).",

H5N1 virus infection has also been associated with extrarespiratory disease. In the lymphoreticular system there was marked histiocytic hyperplasia and reactive haemophagocytic syndrome. Other lesions included atrophy of white pulp in the spleen, centrilobular necrosis in the liver, acute tubular necrosis in the kidney, necrosis of skeletal muscle fibres and necrosis in the brain with microglial nodules (To et al., 2001, Peiris et al., 2004b, Chokephaibulkit et al., 2005, Uiprasertkul et al., 2005). Infection with pH1N1 rarely demonstrates haemophagocytosis or neuromuscular and cardiac complications (Rothberg et al., 2008). Infection with seasonal influenza virus primarily infects and causes disease in the respiratory tract and is associated, albeit to a lesser extent, with disease in extrarespiratory organs. These include influenza-associated acute encephalopathy (Studahl, 2003), myocarditis (Ray et al., 1989) and myopathy (Agyeman et al., 2004).",

Experimental H5N1 infection in cynomolgus macaques causes both morbidity and mortality (Kuiken et al., 2010). Microscopical lesions are centred in the alveoli and bronchioles and consist of DAD that is more severe than for human influenza viruses (Table 2, Fig. 1) (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001, Kuiken et al., 2003b, Kreijtz et al., 2009). Extrarespiratory tissues do not show histological lesions (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001, Kuiken et al., 2003b, Baskin et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009), although suppurative tonsillitis, lymphocytic necrosis in lymphoid organs, hepatic necrosis and renal tubular necrosis are seen rarely (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001, Kuiken et al., 2003b). Experimental pH1N1 infection in cynomolgus macaques causes morbidity, but no mortality. Microscopical lesions consist of multifocal moderate DAD (Table 2). In addition, there is moderate bronchiolitis and mild bronchitis, tracheitis and rhinitis. The severity of pH1N1-induced pulmonary lesions is higher than those induced by seasonal influenza H1N1, but lower than those induced by H5N1. Experimental seasonal influenza virus infection in cynomolgus macaques also causes morbidity, but no mortality. Microscopical lesions consist of focal to multifocal mild DAD with mild necrosis and no oedema, hyaline membranes or lesions in the other parts of the respiratory tract (Herfst et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The pathological changes of influenza virus infection in fatal human cases and in laboratory animals show both differences and similarities (Table 2). These can be compared according to localization, character, severity and temporal changes in the lesions, and the degree of extrarespiratory spread. Firstly, the localization of the lesions in the respiratory tract, between different viruses, in general is similar for man and laboratory animals. In seasonal influenza infection, the upper respiratory tract is mostly affected, in pH1N1 infection, all parts of the respiratory tract are affected, and in H5N1 infection, the lower respiratory tract is mostly affected (Guarner et al., 2006, Shieh et al., 2010, van den Brand et al., 2012a). There are some differences in localization, since H5N1 infection in laboratory animals involves more of the air-conducting parts of the respiratory tract than in man, and vice versa for pH1N1 and seasonal influenza virus infections. Secondly, the character of the respiratory tract lesions is similar for man and laboratory animals. This includes the alveolar lesions after infection with H5N1 and pH1N1. These alveolar lesions result in DAD characterized by necrosis of epithelial cells, oedema, infiltration of inflammatory cells and epithelial regeneration. Thirdly, the severity of the respiratory tract lesions appears greater in man than in laboratory animals. For example, fatal human cases often show alveolar oedema and hyaline membranes, which are less common in laboratory animals. One factor may be that laboratory animals are killed before severe disease or death occurs. Fourthly, the temporal dynamics of influenza virus infection in ferrets may reflect the differences in the age of pathological changes in fatal human cases due to the duration of their illness before dying. Fifthly, the degree of extrarespiratory involvement of H5N1 infection in man is difficult to compare with that in laboratory animals because it is so poorly described in man. The involvement of the CNS in some human cases of H5N1 infection (de Jong et al., 2005) appears similar to that in ferrets, where extrarespiratory spread often is limited to the CNS. In contrast, extrarespiratory spread of H5N1 in man is probably not as common or as widespread as in cats (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2006). Overall, many features of the pathological changes in man and laboratory animals are similar. The choice of animal model, including laboratory animal species, route of virus inoculation and dose of inoculum, will depend on the specific feature of influenza in man that one wishes to study.",

Attachment of the viral haemagglutinin to its host cell receptor is the first step in the influenza virus replication cycle. The receptor on the surface of the host cell is a sialic acid (SA)-terminated glycan. Human-adapted influenza viruses prefer binding of an \u03b1-2,6 SA linkage, which is present throughout the human respiratory tract, while avian influenza viruses prefer binding by an \u03b1-2,3 SA linkage, which is abundantly present in the respiratory and intestinal tract of aquatic birds (Connor et al., 1994, Shinya et al., 2006). Because different influenza viruses use different SAs as their receptor, and because the expression of SAs differs both across the respiratory tract and across species, this step influences both the pattern of disease in the respiratory tract and the host range of virus infection.",

Direct cytopathic damage is suggested by high virus titres found in severely damaged lung tissue as well as in throat or nose swabs (Hien et al., 2004, Peiris et al., 2004b), while virus antigen expression in epithelial cells was associated with severe DAD (Uiprasertkul et al., 2005, Uiprasertkul et al., 2007, Kuiken et al., 2010).",

The different age distribution of fatality from pH1N1 infection is probably related to the presence of immunity from previous infections with H1N1 influenza viruses in older people. Because these viruses were antigenically related to pH1N1, the antibodies were cross-reactive and therefore protected from severe disease from pH1N1 infection (Hancock et al., 2009).",

For pH1N1, the pattern of virus antigen expression in ferrets most closely resembles that in man. For seasonal influenza viruses, the pattern of virus antigen expression differs between man, cynomolgus macaques and ferrets. When comparing the results of virus antigen expression studies in experimentally infected animals and fatal human cases, the following factors need to be taken into account: route of virus entry, dose of virus inoculum, stage of disease at which tissue samples are taken, and immune status. The route of entry in animal models is mostly by intranasal or intratracheal inoculation, while in man it is by air through small or large droplets. The dose of the virus inoculum in animal experiments is usually much higher than in human infection. Tissue samples are often taken at an earlier, less severe stage of disease in laboratory animals than in man. Tissue sampling in laboratory animals is usually from non-fatal cases, because the animals are killed before they succumb to the infection. In contrast, tissue sampling in people is usually from fatal cases, where patients have died after protracted disease and multiple therapeutic interventions. Finally, the immune status is different: laboratory animals are usually na\u00efve to influenza virus, while many people have specific immunity, which may alter the course of subsequent influenza virus infections.",

Apoptotic damage is suggested by experiments with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-expressing macrophages that induced epithelial cell apoptosis in influenza virus pneumonia (Takizawa et al., 1993, Lowy, 2003, Herold et al., 2008). Additionally, apoptosis may be induced by up-regulation of certain chemokines and cytokines (Uiprasertkul et al., 2007). These findings suggest that direct damage of the virus by cytopathic and apoptotic mechanisms is important in the development of pathological changes in influenza virus infections.

Differences in histopathological changes, antigen expression and receptor specificity between people and laboratory animal species are species related, as was seen in SARS-CoV infection. Macaques infected with H5N1 displayed severe disease and activation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses (Baskin et al., 2009). In ferrets, H5N1 infection also induced severe disease associated with strong expression of interferon response genes, including the IFN-\u03b3-induced chemokine CXCL10. When those ferrets were treated with an antagonist of the CXCL10 receptor (CXCR3), the severity of H5N1-related disease and the viral titres were reduced when compared with controls (Cameron et al., 2008). For pH1N1, the abundance of neutrophils and macrophages in pulmonary lesions corresponded with up-regulation of CCL2, CCL3, CCL8, CXC10, IL-8 and CXCL1, which are known chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, as is seen in macaques. Compared with lungs of cynomolgus macaques infected with seasonal human H1N1 virus, concentrations of MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-18 were higher. This is in line with the more severe pulmonary lesions in cynomolgus macaques infected with pH1N1 than with seasonal human influenza H1N1 virus (Itoh et al., 2009). On the contrary, alveolar macrophages infected with H5N1 did not induce excessive TNF-\u03b1. However, alveolar macrophages were infected more abundantly by H5N1 than by seasonal H1N1 or pH1N1 (van Riel et al., 2011). Therefore, the imbalance in the level of virus infection and resultant cytokine and chemokine production may at least in part contribute to the development of lesions after infection with H5N1 and pH1N1.",

SARS and influenza show a similar character of lesions, typified by necrosis and inflammation. Firstly, the necrosis that is seen in the lungs with both SARS and influenza can in part be explained by a direct cytopathic effect or apoptotic mechanisms. These mechanisms lead to damage of epithelial cells, increased permeability of the alveolar epithelium, damage of endothelial cells and subsequent oedema and haemorrhage, followed by formation of hyaline membranes (Berthiaume and Matthay, 2007). Secondly, the necrosis and inflammation in SARS and influenza can additionally be attributed to the dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine production. Dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines in SARS-CoV and H5N1 virus infection correlates with high viral loads in pharyngeal swabs and more severe pathological changes in severe or fatal cases (de Jong et al., 2006, Cameron et al., 2007, de Lang et al., 2007). Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 attract immune cells that constitute the inflammatory infiltrate, which leads to even more production of cytokines and chemokines (Theron et al., 2005, Berthiaume and Matthay, 2007, Thiel and Weber, 2008). Together with the activation of oxidative stress mechanisms that are induced by the up-regulated cytokines, there is further cellular damage and inflammation resulting in DAD (Tsushima et al., 2009). Additionally, the infiltration of neutrophils results in a release of lytic enzymes that cause further necrosis of epithelial cells and the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells that results in necrosis of infected epithelial cells.",

For infections with SARS-CoV and influenza viruses, there is a correlation between the distributions of the receptor, the tropism of the virus and the associated lesions (Tables 1 and 2). However, not all differences in the pathology between various animal species can be explained by the differences in receptor distribution (Tables 3 and 4). This implies that other receptors and factors also play a role in the attachment, replication, infectiousness and virulence of both viruses (Lau and Peiris, 2005, Nicholls et al., 2007).",

            "text": "There are two pathological features that are remarkable in both SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections: pulmonary fibrosis and tracheobronchoadenitis. First, in severe human cases of both SARS and influenza there is marked loss of alveolar epithelial lining, which may lead to re-epithelialization and recovery, to death or to pulmonary fibrosis. Late stages of fatal human cases of SARS were characterized by intra-alveolar and intrabronchiolar fibrosis, and in approximately 62% of non-fatal SARS cases there was evidence for fibrosis in thin section computed tomography (CT) 1 month later (Franks et al., 2003). In contrast, interstitial fibrosis has been described in only a few fatal cases of H5N1 influenza, including in two case descriptions with radiological follow-up showing fibrosis-related changes (To et al., 2001, Antonio et al., 2003). For pH1N1 influenza, pulmonary fibrosis was also seen in only a few cases by follow-up CT and the fibrosis often disappeared after 1 month (Bai et al., 2011, Mineo et al., 2012). The importance of the previously mentioned factors for fibrosis in SARS is not clear. Unfortunately, fibrosis is not a prominent feature of SARS-CoV or influenza virus infection in laboratory animals. This may be explained in part by the less severe lesions and the early time point at which the animals are killed. Therefore, this phenomenon is difficult to study in animal models. The reason for the severe fibrosis in fatal human cases of SARS remains unclear and needs further investigation. Secondly, tracheobronchoadenitis was demonstrated in SARS-CoV infection in cats and young macaques (van den Brand et al., 2008, Smits et al., 2010) and in pH1N1 virus infection in ferrets and was clearly associated with expression of virus antigen (van den Brand et al., 2012a). This finding has potentially important implications for the excretion of those viruses. Excretion of virus might increase due to infection of the tracheobronchial submucosal glands and a diminished efficient defence by the mucociliary system, and virus secreted by these glands into the trachea and bronchi is more likely to be expectorated than virus produced lower in the respiratory tract.",

This phenomenon is also seen in a variety of other viral infections, such as West Nile virus and norovirus infections, probably because the elderly respond poorly to new antigens compared with younger people due to immunosenescence (Plackett et al., 2004, Licastro et al., 2005, Meyer, 2005, Murasko and Jiang, 2005, Salvioli et al., 2006). Immunosenescence is a multifactorial process that is associated with thymic involution, chronic antigen stimulation due to persistent infections, signal transduction changes in immune cells and protein\u2013energy malnutrition (Fulop et al., 2005). Although all components of immunity are affected with ageing, the T cells are the most susceptible and the increased susceptibility to lower respiratory tract viral infections is particularly related to defective T cell responses (Fulop et al., 2005, Holt et al., 2005, Johnston, 2007). Additionally, advanced age causes a general increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in plasma, resulting in an age-related increase of inflammation (Salvioli et al., 2006). Increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8, were produced upon stimulation of leucocytes in the elderly, while induction of antiviral type I IFNs was decreased compared with young adults (Rink et al., 1998, Yoon et al., 2004, Kong et al., 2008). Moreover, ageing results in less protection against the oxidative stress that is induced by virus infections and overreacting proinflammatory responses (Chung et al., 2006).",

Pre-existing co-morbidities and pregnancy are associated predominantly with suppression of the immune response, as is seen in older patients. In SARS, male sex is correlated with more severe disease, while in H5N1 infection females appear to have a worse outcome than males, although not significantly (Table 4) (Karlberg et al., 2004, Louie et al., 2011, WHO, 2012). Interestingly, a sex difference in the pathology of immune responses after viral infection is suggested, since influenza virus infection of mice results in greater neutrophil influx and more severe lesions in females than in males (Karnam et al., 2012).",

            "text": "When comparing the influenza virus infections in man, it is remarkable that H5N1 appears more likely to spread to extrarespiratory tissues than seasonal influenza virus (de Jong et al., 2006). In patients infected with H5N1, diarrhoea was associated with the detection of H5N1 RNA in faeces; it was suggested that the virus may infect the gastrointestinal tract directly or after subsequent dissemination via blood, since H5N1 RNA was also detected in plasma (Beigel et al., 2005, Uiprasertkul et al., 2005, Chutinimitkul et al., 2006, de Jong et al., 2006). The hypothesis that H5N1 could enter the human host via the gastrointestinal tract is supported by the results of experimental H5N1 infections in cats. Intestinal H5N1 inoculation resulted in viral replication in the capillary endothelium of the intestinal mucosa, which was not seen in cats infected intratracheally (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2006, Reperant et al., 2012). Like H5N1 influenza, SARS in man is a respiratory disease with extrarespiratory virus dissemination, as demonstrated by antigen expression in several organs and excretion of virus via respiratory secretions, stool, urine and possibly sweat (Ding et al., 2004, Farcas et al., 2005). Additionally, diarrhoea was seen in SARS, with active viral replication in enterocytes but minimal disruption of the intestinal architecture or cellular infiltration. Up-regulation of the potent immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-\u03b2 (Cheng et al., 2004) and an anti-apoptotic host cellular response in the intestinal epithelial cells (Peiris et al., 2004a) may be a cause for the diarrhoea. Spread to other extrarespiratory tissues, such as the CNS, has been noted in H5N1 infection of mammals such as mice, ferrets and felids (Lipatov et al., 2003, Tanaka et al., 2003, Keawcharoen et al., 2004), but has been recorded rarely in human H5N1 infections (Morishima et al., 2002, Sugaya, 2002, de Jong et al., 2005, Gu et al., 2007). For SARS in man, no involvement of the CNS has been seen.",

Samples taken from fatal human cases of SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections often do not represent the full range of the different temporal stages of a disease. Instead, they are more likely to represent late-stage disease. In addition, the lesions caused by the viral infection may be complicated by lesions caused by clinical treatments and concurrent pre-existing disease. Therefore, to be able to study the course of the disease caused by these viruses, good animal models are necessary for SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections in man. Good animal models for SARS and influenza in man should ideally show virus replication dynamics, clinical illness and pathological changes that resemble those of human cases. The choice and design of an animal model used in an experiment is crucial for the outcome of the investigation and should be considered carefully. Time course experiments provide information about the temporal and spatial dynamics that help to design such animal models, including which time points and which samples are best to gain the most useful information (van den Brand et al., 2012a). Not only the best time points and analyses of the most informative samples should be considered carefully, but also the animal species, the inoculation route and the age of the animals are important, as is shown by studies of H5N1 influenza in ferrets and of SARS in aged mice and macaques (Rockx et al., 2009, Smits et al., 2010, Bodewes et al., 2011). Taken together, animal models should be designed specifically to address the aspect of SARS or influenza in man that one is interested in, since no one animal model can hope to address all the variation that is inherent in these viral diseases.",

            "text": "In designing animal models for SARS, important factors are the species and age of the laboratory animal used. Non-human primates, especially aged cynomolgus macaques and AGMs, most closely reflect the pathology in fatal human SARS by demonstrating typical pathological features such as hyaline membranes and syncytial cells on SARS-CoV infection (Smits et al., 2011). However, the severity of the clinical signs and lesions, level of mortality and extent of antigen expression in non-human primates is less (Table 1) (Nicholls et al., 2006). The variation in pathological changes and cytokine profiles among different non-human primate species, as well as among age groups within each species, may reflect the variation in severity of disease among people. For example, the mild degree of pneumonia in SARS-CoV-infected young-adult cynomolgus macaques may resemble the milder cases of SARS in man (Kuiken et al., 2004, Qin et al., 2005, Lawler et al., 2006, Smits et al., 2010). While aged cynomolgus macaques are good animal models for pathogenesis studies, vaccination studies and intervention studies of fatal SARS in man, large disadvantages are ethical, cost-related and housing problems. Ferrets infected with SARS-CoV only partly resemble fatal human SARS in terms of clinical illness, mortality and typical histopathological features (Table 1) (van den Brand et al., 2008). Moreover, methods for measuring gene expression profiles of ferrets are not yet fully developed. Nevertheless, ferrets can be used for pathogenesis and vaccination studies because they show SARS-CoV-associated pulmonary lesions and develop humoral immunity associated with reduced virus replication on vaccination. Cats infected with SARS-CoV show fewer similarities with the human situation and have greater ethical, cost-related and housing problems. Therefore, they are used less as animal models for human SARS (van den Brand et al., 2008). Although not discussed here, the use of aged BALB/c mice as an animal model for fatal human SARS may be an alternative, since there are many difficulties in the use of aged macaques (Subbarao and Roberts, 2006). Recombinant zoonotic and early phase SARS-CoV infection of these mice results in clinical signs, virus replication, pulmonary lesions and associated virus antigen expression in type II-resembling pneumocytes, bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells that partly resemble the features seen in fatal human SARS (Rockx et al., 2009). Therefore, aged BALB/c mice may be used for pathogenesis, antiviral and vaccination studies. A disadvantage may be age-related disease or mortality not related to SARS-CoV infection, which may influence the results.",

Therefore, route of inoculation often depends on the purpose of the experiment. Transmission studies (at least in ferrets) may well use intranasal inoculation, which favours replication in the nose rather than in the lungs. This may correlate with virus excretion from the nose and minor pulmonary lesions. Additionally, intranasal inoculation in ferrets results in encephalitis, sometimes without pneumonia (Bodewes et al., 2011), and therefore this is not a good route for inducing viral pneumonia. In contrast, intratracheal inoculation favours replication in the lungs and is more likely to result in severe pneumonia, which makes this route of inoculation useful for pathogenesis and vaccination studies for viral pneumonia (van den Brand et al., 2010a).",

In cynomolgus macaques, the outcome of infection differs markedly according to the influenza virus used (Table 2) (Herfst et al., 2010). Therefore, cynomolgus macaques are probably not the best species to use for pathogenesis studies of fatal human disease from pH1N1 or seasonal influenza virus infections. However, because these viruses do replicate and cause virus-associated lesions, cynomolgus macaques may be useful for vaccination studies. In contrast, cynomolgus macaques infected with H5N1 show similar features as fatal human H5N1 infection and therefore can be used for pathogenesis, vaccination or therapeutics studies of H5N1 infection. Ferrets infected with different influenza viruses show similar virus replication dynamics, clinical illness, virus associated pathological changes and virus attachment patterns as in man (Table 2), and therefore are often used in animal models for various purposes. Cats infected with H5N1 show similar pathology of the respiratory tract, but additionally demonstrate a more widespread systemic infection than is seen in human cases. The virus antigen expression and virus attachment patterns in cats show differences and similarities similar to the case in ferrets. The systemic dissemination makes the cat less useful for animal models of fatal human H5N1 pneumonia or vaccination studies, since extrarespiratory replication and inflammation can influence the results. Taken together, ferrets are a good animal species to model fatal human influenza; however, there are species differences between man and ferrets, as well as differences between laboratory and field conditions. Therefore, the conclusions from ferret studies need thorough assessment to be able to make full use of the results without over-interpreting them.",

Only very recently and ongoing there are two outbreaks of mild to severe respiratory illness with clinical disease and pathological features comparable to those in SARS-CoV and influenza viruses. In 2012, there was an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by the MERS-CoV in the Middle East (van Boheemen et al., 2012). People from Europe and Africa have acquired MERS-CoV while travelling or staying in the Middle East, with to date more than 139 cases with 60 fatal cases (CDC, 2013). Additionally, there is limited human to human transmission, as is demonstrated by reports on 12 clusters, which occurred among close contacts or in healthcare settings (CDC, 2013). Only one autopsy of a MERS patient is described so far and this revealed severe DAD comparable with that seen in SARS (unpublished data). Experiments with rhesus and cynomolgus macaques and ferrets have demonstrated that the character of the lesions is comparable with those in macaques infected with SARS-CoV (unpublished data) (Munster et al., 2013). As in SARS-CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques, the severity and extent of the lesions in macaques is less than seen in human patients. Ferrets did not show a productive infection in contrast to what is seen in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV. As in SARS, a good animal model for severe pneumonia in human MERS has not yet been established and more research needs to be done.",

In the future, new or improved techniques such as genomics, proteomics and stem cell research may improve our knowledge of disease and recovery after disease and may be helpful in the development of effective interventions against severe disease. For seasonal influenza, aged animals may be an alternative for the inoculation of high doses of virus in ferrets as is seen in SARS-CoV infection in aged macaques and mice and recently for pH1N1 in aged macaques (Rockx et al., 2009, Smits et al., 2010, Josset et al., 2012). For all respiratory viruses that cause severe damage of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, treatment with stem cells may prevent severely ill patients from dying (Kumar et al., 2011). For both SARS and influenza, experiments with immunosuppressed animals (e.g. by using methods that are also used in organ transplantation) may help find better animal models that more accurately mimic the clinical situation (van der Vries et al., 2013).",
