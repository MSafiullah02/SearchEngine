Since there are no valid medicines or vaccines for SARS, measures to control the spread of SARS had to take two major forms: isolation of symptomatic individuals and quarantining and close observation of asymptomatic individuals [2]. It had been shown that quarantining and isolating diseased individuals is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks, because of a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals [2], [3], [4]. Moreover, Gumel [3] examines the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing in a mathematical way. It uses a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS-related deaths.",

            "text": "In addition, mathematical models have recently been used to examine the transmission dynamics and to model the control of SARS in the literature [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. But most of them are mainly in the purely simulative levels [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Wang and Ruan [9] propose a mathematical model consists of six subpopulations, namely susceptible, exposed, quarantined, suspect, probable, and removed, to simulate the SARS outbreak in Beijing. Chowell and Castillo-Chavez [10] use the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R0 to assess the role that the model parameters play in outbreak control, and the results show that the transmission rate and isolation effectiveness have the largest fractional effect on R0. Shi [11] and Lloyd-Smith [12] present a stochastic dynamic model of SARS spreading, and a stochastic model of a SARS outbreak in a community and its hospital, respectively. Furthermore, small-world networks have been introduced to study the propagation of SARS by Naoki Masuda [13] and Small [14]. It has been shown that if all infectious individuals are isolated as rapidly as they are identified, the severity of the outbreak would be minimal [14]. Moreover, Gumel [3] and Chowell [4] attempt to obtain a threshold for the basic reproductive number R0 for assessing the strategies of quarantine and isolation, and discuss the control of SARS by looking at the role of disease transmission parameters in the reduction of R0 and the prevalence of the disease, while the discrete case has been studied by Zhou and Ma [15]. However, those models do not consider control strategies, since their discussions are based on prevalence of disease at equilibria. In Swan\u2019s work [16], optimal control theory is applied to obtain maximal benefits in terms of social benefits from the parsimonious use of insufficient public funds in the control of epidemics. Moreover, the Pontryagin\u2019s Maximum Principle [17] and the time dependent control strategies are also applied for the studies of HIV models [18], mosquito-borne diseases [19], insect transmitted diseases [20], dengue models [21], tuberculosis models [22] and others [23].",

This performance specification involves the numbers of individuals of symptomatic, asymptomatic, quarantined, or isolated, respectively, as well as the cost for applying quarantine control (u1) and isolation control (u2). The total cost includes not only the consumption for every individual, but also the cost of organization, management, and cooperation etc. Hence, the cost function should be nonlinear. In this paper, a quadratic function is implemented for measuring the control cost by reference to many papers in epidemic control [18], [19], [20], [21], [22].

The uniqueness of the optimal control pair follows from the uniqueness of the optimality system, which consists of (1), (5), (6) with characterizations (7), (8). There is a restriction on the length of the time interval in order to guarantee the uniqueness of the optimality system. This smallness restriction on the length on the time interval is due to the opposite time orientations of (1), (5), (6); the state problem has initial values and the adjoint problem has final values. This restriction is very common in control problems (see [18], [22]).\nRemark 2The problem described above is a Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP), with specified initial conditions for the state equation (1), and terminal boundary conditions (6) for the adjoint equation (5). It can be numerically solved by the iteration method presented in Section 5.\n",

The optimal Quarantine and Isolation Control is obtained by solving the optimality conditions, consisting of twelve ODEs from the state and their adjoint equations. This problem (TPBVP) is solved by using the multiple shooting method (see, for instance, [21], [26], [27]) as follows: (1)Select n nodes to divide the interval [0,tf], or, 0=t1\u2a7dt2\u2a7d\u22ef\u2a7dtn=tf.(2)Choose yi\u2254[x(ti),\u03bb(ti)], i=1,\u2026,n.(3)Integrate (1), (5) for each time interval [ti,ti+1) using yi as the initial conditions, and obtaining y(ti\u22121)=[x(ti\u22121),\u03bb(ti\u22121)].(4)Compute h\u2254[hi] where hi\u2254yi\u2212y(ti).(5)If |h| is sufficiently close to a minimum value, then stop; Else modify the initial conditions yi for the next iteration (using, for instance, the Newton\u2013Raphson algorithm to make hi\u2254yinew\u2212y(ti)=0) and go to step (3). In this work, the optimal control was computed using the multiple shooting method with 30 nodes, up to a tolerance of 10\u22125 for |h|. Considering the four weight factors associated with E, Q, I and J, we choose B1=B2=B3=B4=1, C1=300 and C2=600 to illustrate the optimal strategies. Remark 3We assume that the weight factor C2 associated with control u2 is much larger than C1, which is associated with control u1. This assumption is based on the following facts: The cost associated with u1 mainly includes the cost of monitoring and quarantining programs, while the cost associated with u2 includes the cost of monitoring and isolating programs, and the hospital treatment resource. The ideal weights are very hard to obtain in practice. It needs a lot of work on data mining, analyzing, and fitting. Hence, the acquisition of appropriate practical weights is a difficult problem and it still remains for further investigations. It should be pointed out that the weights in the simulations here are of only theoretical interest to illustrate the control strategies proposed in this paper.\n",

As normally expected, in the early phase of the epidemic breakouts, keeping the quarantine and isolation controls at their upper bounds will directly lead to decreasing of the number of the infected people. Moreover, Fig. 3\nshows that if we take the lower bound values for each control throughout the simulated time, the number of infected individuals would reach about 4.1919\u00d7106 (nearly 35% of the total population). This illustrates that the quarantine and isolation strategies are critically important to control the outbreaks of SARS.

Furthermore, this idea of introducing these two new control variables is helpful for further discussions on catastrophic epidemic control. It should be pointed out that, as was mentioned in [23], the ideal time-varying optimal strategy might not be applied in practice easily. Nevertheless, it does provide a reference basis on which to design the practical quasi-optimal control strategies or policies, and to assess their effectiveness. However, the proposed sub-optimal control in this paper can provide much simpler strategies, which, as verified by numerical simulations, can also lead to a performance very similar to that achieved by the optimal control.
