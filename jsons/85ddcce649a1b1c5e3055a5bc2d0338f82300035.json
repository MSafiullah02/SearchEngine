World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of fatality rates are of the above type, which may not be able to reflect the latest changes in fatality due to treatment or government policy in a timely fashion. Here, the authors propose an estimate of a realtime fatality rate based on a chain multinomial model with a kernel function. It is more accurate than the WHO estimate in describing fatality, especially earlier in the course of an epidemic. The estimator provides useful information for public health policy makers for understanding the severity of the disease or evaluating the effects of treatments or policies within a shorter time period, which is critical in disease control during an outbreak. Simulation results showed that the performance of the proposed estimator is superior to that of the WHO estimator in terms of its sensitivity to changes and its timeliness in reflecting the severity of the disease. disease outbreaks; epidemiologic methods; fatality rate; models, statistical; multinomial model; severe acute respiratory syndrome Abbreviations: SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; WHO, World Health Organization.

Estimation of fatality rates for an outbreak or epidemic of an emerging disease is not straightforward. This was particularly true for the SARS outbreak, in which clinicians all over the world had to deal with this highly contagious and frightening pneumonic illness with almost no knowledge about its etiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, management, or prognosis, other than anecdotal information obtained from colleagues in China (2) (3) (4) .",

These discrepancies do not reflect a change in the severity of the disease; rather, they are an artifact of WHO methodology. The WHO estimate of the fatality rate is the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the total number of cases diagnosed. In the early part of the epidemic, few patients died from SARS, since their infection had not run its course; hence, the estimated fatality rate was low. As the epidemic developed, more people reached the terminal stage of the disease and died, but more people were being diagnosed, so the estimated rate was still low. It was only towards the end of the epidemic, when there were relatively few new cases arising, that the WHO estimate could be expected to perform well. Apparently, this problem is known to public health professionals; for example, it was acknowledged in the cautious paragraph published along with the definition of ''case fatality rate'' in Last's Dictionary of Epidemiology (6). However, no viable alternative has been suggested in the literature. Underestimation of the fatality rate might affect how seriously an outbreak is taken and subsequent vaccination efforts aimed at controlling the epidemic. This deficiency in the WHO estimate of the fatality rate of a disease motivated us to write this paper. We developed a new estimator using a chain multinomial model of an emerging epidemic. In this model, in time period t, hospital inpatients either die with probability p 1t , recover with probability p 2t , or remain in the hospital. The transition probabilities are assumed to depend on calendar time (days since the start of the epidemic) rather than chronologic time related to the onset of disease for each individual, since the latter times often are not known or cannot be obtained quickly, especially in the case of a new emerging disease. There is no need to model the number of infectious disease patients if our interest is in the fatality inflicted by the epidemic. The fatality rate p t \u00bc p 1t /(p 1t \u00fe p 2t ) is the conditional probability of death given either recovery or death. Simple estimates of p 1t and p 2t may be obtained at each stage of the epidemic. However, these estimates may be based on limited numbers of cases and may be quite variable. We propose applying a kernel smoothing method to the simple estimates of the probabilities of recovery and death. Then, a simple transformation of the estimated transition probabilities yields an estimate of the fatality rate in real time. The variance of this estimator and associated pointwise confidence limits for the fatality rate are also given here.",

This may reflect that the patients who were initially admitted were quite ill but, as the epidemic progressed, patients were admitted earlier in the progression of their disease. The estimated fatality rate stabilized at the beginning of April, and until mid-June it fluctuated between 15 percent and 25 percent. The stabilization of the estimated fatality rate could reflect a more mature approach in the diagnosis and treatment of SARS, although the efficacy of using high-dose corticosteroid and ribavirin to deal with lung parenchymal inflammation and the coronavirus itself is controversial (14) (15) (16) . Alternatively, it could reflect a stationary distribution of the chain multinomial model. The WHO-adopted estimate increased gradually over the course of the epidemic and converged to the final overall fatality rate, which was approximately 17 percent. . As in Hong Kong, the fatality rate was estimated to be high in the early stage of the epidemic. It then continuously improved over the course of the epidemic, with an overall fatality rate of approximately 8 percent. The reduction in the fatality rate is possibly related to the use of different treatments by the Chinese authorities, who also implemented effective measures to prevent infection in the community and in hospitals during the epidemic. In Beijing, a special hospital was built within 2 weeks of the start of the epidemic to treat SARS patients. Here, the WHO fatality rate overestimates the fatality rate in the latter part of the epidemic. The use of traditional Chinese medicine has also been suggested to have contributed to the low rate of fatality in Beijing, and glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice root, has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARSassociated coronavirus (17) .",

This mirrors the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong, where the strain of the SARS virus was found to be more lethal. In this scenario, it is assumed that the death rate then drops back to its initial level after a period of time. Scenario III assumes a consistently decreasing death rate and an increasing recovery rate. In this scenario, the fatality rate would decrease monotonically.",

In addition, the WHO fatality rate did not reflect the later decrease in the fatality rate.

The present formulation is also different from traditional survival analysis, which adopts chronologic time on the individual level rather than calendar time on the population level and thus requires more detailed data. The proposed chain multinomial model of using the real-time case fatality rate should allow epidemiologists to monitor not only SARS but also other emerging infections and conditions in the future. It can provide a timely and accurate estimate of the number of fatalities inflicted by an epidemic, especially in the earlier period when decisions on health policy and treatment are most critical. It works satisfactorily if the durations of hospital stays for recoveries and deaths are not that different. Yip et al. (18) adopted a competing risk model to provide an estimate of the real-time fatality for SARS using a counting process approach. In the absence of data from controlled clinical trials on SARS treatment, it is interesting to speculate as to whether the different estimated fatality rates between Hong Kong and Beijing could be related to the different clinical treatment protocols used.",
