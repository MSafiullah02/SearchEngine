The ESPREssO Project (Enhancing Synergies for Disaster Prevention in the European Union) aims to improve management of transboundary disasters by encouraging closer synergies between the CCA and DRR communities. Using targeted stakeholder interviews, questionnaires, Think Tank discussions and purpose-built serious games, ESPREssO draws on both CCA and DRR stakeholder experiences and informed perspectives in order to identify current gaps. Set within a fictitious border zone, ESPREssO's RAMSETE II serious game challenges CCA and DRR stakeholders in making coordinated decisions before, during and after a simulated disaster, in protection of population and critical infrastructure.",

These good practice examples reflect the fact that transboundary settings, despite their challenges, act as fertile ground for mutual growth, offering opportunities for CCA and DRR communities to find innovative ways to cooperate and unite in developing synergies and strengthening their mutual efforts towards resilience. Stakeholders emphasise a need to invest more resources in informal cooperation and call on policy makers to recognise that each border zone raises its own unique set of complex challenges that requires flexibility and special consideration by transboundary authorities in management of disasters.",

Legislation such as the Hyogo Framework (2005-2015 [11] ) and its successor the Sendai Framework (2015-2030 [12] ) provided practitioners with synergising starting points, but increased emphasis and more work is still needed to be put into creating practical solutions to their integration (Gero et al., 2010 [13] ) which must be adequately supported by local government (EUR-OPA UNISDR, 2011 [7] ). The 2011 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction suggested incorporation of CCA and DRR in central planning locations or a relevant ministry with funds and the authority to support a risk reduction agenda (GAR, 2011 [14] ). Governments are beginning to combine the two spheres into new national legislation or in a single ministerial responsibility but in Europe there are still problems with national-level planning and investment that need to be overome in order that their progression is synergetic (EUR-OPA UNISDR, 2011 [7] ). This paper concentrates on when these efforts stop or meet additional hurdles at borders, where complexities can be amplified by different (or even conflicting) policies, practices and cultures. Integrated delivery of CCA and DRR is driven by and critically dependent on detailed local socioeconomic and environmental knowledge (EUR-OPA UNISDR, 2011 [7] ). It is therefore logical that local governance often takes the first proactive steps in creating initiatives to deliver CCA and DRR in coherent ways. The outstanding challenge is preventing loss of support and both knowledge and financial investment as issues filter upwards through different levels of governance to regional to central government and competing priorities converge to potentially dilute or duplicate actions.",

There are gaps at local transboundary level in terms of scientific investment, and in overcoming bureaucratic hurdles in order to share data and expertise. Yet these are the front lines most vulnerable in times of crisis, often requiring rapid access to state-controlled or even cross-border resources. Lack of scientifically relevant (or useable) data at these levels exacerbates their vulnerability, when compared to national level. It is the local level which also contains the flexibility to be proactive in securing themselves, particularly true of transboundary areas, so while there is vulnerability, there is a natural generation of proactive resilience-success stories which should be used as templates for other areas.",

Barriers exist that hinder horizontal integration-particularly across borders-such as language, differing political priorities, divergent funding mechanisms, competition for resources and mismatched timescales for implementation. There is less experience for cooperatively developing lateral multisectoral strategies (Braunschweiger et al., 2018 [19] ) amongst administrative members, and traditional conflicts may hinder fruitful cooperation. Coordinating agencies which take on organisational duties for other sectors without challenging their sovereignty are viewed as successful options for increasing horizontal cooperation (Braunschweiger et al., 2018 [19] ) along with building on existing networks already in place. Taskoriented project collaboration works best for issue-based cooperation between sectors, which requires to produce visible results. This can lead to longer term partnerships which integrate adaptation measures into ongoing development processes (Braunschweiger et al., 2018 [19] ).",

Brethaut et al., (2018 [33] ) states that if water management is already characterized by complex multi-level interactions and trade-offs among various sectoral uses, the transboundary scale represents an additional level of intricacy with the involvement of different institutional and legal frameworks, multiple asymmetries among parties involved (Warner and Zawahri, 2012 [39] ) and tensions between national interests. In other words, transboundary water management represents a \"wicked problem\" (Levin et al., 2012 [40] ; Varone et al., 2013 [41] ) which calls for new solutions and new institutional arrangements. (Brethaut et al., 2018 [33] ). There is therefore a two-sided aspect to CCA therefore that policy makers need to be objective of. CCA (rightly or wrongly) can be used to move the goalposts of long-held political processes, it can increase competition and it can elevate political ambitions. In other words, CCA, is a \"game-changer\" in many aspects of DRR. The implications of this for transboundary risk management are particularly notable, e.g. in the locating of vulnerable assets. This \"game-changing\" aspect will be incorporated into ESPREssO's serious game to explore both positive and negative outcomes, depending on the choices players make.",

The whole region is exposed to a range of natural hazards: earthquakes, floods, storms, as well as the potential for Natech (a technological event, e.g., chemical spill, triggered by a natural hazard) events, both chemical and radiogenic. The exercise sees the participants confronted with a series of extreme events, requiring some form of collaboration between the participating countries, as well as with NGOs and European mechanisms. Therefore, the importance of this exercise is the decisions made about what are the best policies to follow so as to deal with extreme events, while taking into consideration the other nation, including following a \"build back better\" policy. The exercise involves three rounds, each dealing with a different disaster. Each round consisted of several phases: (1) Policy and preparedness, during which participants negotiated among themselves on how to best establish national and transboundary regulations for the most effective response to natural disasters. (2) Response and recovery, where an extreme event has occurred and the participants must deploy their resources to cope with the resulting damage to the affected assets. Again, this must be dealt with by employing not only the national resources, but also those of the NGO, the EU and, if possible or necessary, the neighbouring country. (3) Debriefing, where the participants are interviewed to determine their motivation for the decisions made, hence one of the more critical aspects of the exercise. It also allows the stakeholders to discuss the more 'realistic' situations given such circumstances in the real world (Fleming, et al., 2019 [49] ).",

In addition, there was the need to consider the recovery phase, including the option of 'building-back-better'. The challenge to the participants was therefore how to best combine policies in order to make the best use of resources in order to safeguard their own territory, and to prevent the other country's crisis affecting theirs. The process of the game therefore saw the participants working within existing regulations, but then deciding on which ones to change where possible, which in turn involved the use of resources.

NGOs do not take a holistic (multi-hazard) approach to strengthening resilience at the local level. Tensions and conflicts among different NGOs may exist, eg., competition for resources, differing interests and visions. However, competition between NGOs for recognition and visibility may also be positive in that it may motivate improved efficiency and best practices with regards to actions on the ground.

Similarly, links between central and local governments first need to be robust-their relationship clearly defined, before effective engagement with satellite NGOs and with the European Commission can yield the most reward, creating a strong institutional framework. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also recognises that intervention of a single agency cannot be evaluated in isolation from what others are doing, particularly as what might seem appropriate from the point of view of a single actor, may not be appropriate from the point of view of the system as a whole (OECD, 1999 [50] ). Local government needs to take a shared global view and national governments need to retain an awareness of local issues. Encouraging state-level understanding of the issues faced by local and regional practitioners in transboundary disasters is critical to moving forward, in ensuring they have the flexibility and reliability in seeking resources to deploy in times of crisis.

Institutional channels of communication may not be symmetrical on both (or all) sides of a given border, creating mismatches in scope and response. The scope of the messages in particular was noted as a key aspect: it is very important that the right stakeholders receive the information they need in a way that they can understand and act upon it. Miscommunication problems often arise between two different political cultures. There may be strong public policies on both sides of a border, but the border area itself becomes a transitionary space, in which institutional frameworks might become blurred, or require strengthening in order to fully operate.
