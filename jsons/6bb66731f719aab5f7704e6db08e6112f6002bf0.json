There are still many unresolved questions regarding the pathogenesis of this disease and especially the reasons underlying the extremely different clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe manifestations, including the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 showed phylogenetic similarities to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, and some of the clinical features are shared between COVID-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections. Available evidence indicate that the so called \"cytokine storm\" an uncontrolled over-production of soluble markers of inflammation which, in turn, sustain an aberrant systemic inflammatory response, is a major responsible for the occurrence of ARDS. Chemokines are low molecular weight proteins with powerful chemoattractant activity which play a role in the immune cell recruitment during inflammation. This review will be aimed at providing an overview of the current knowledge on the involvement of the chemokine/chemokine-receptor system in the cytokine storm related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Basic and clinical evidences obtained from previous SARS and MERS epidemics and available data from COVID-19 will be taken into account.",

The pathogen was identified as a novel enveloped RNA \u03b2 coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4] . The virus showed phylogenetic similarities to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. In view of its similarities to bat coronaviruses, it was postulated that bats could have been the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis suggested that the infection originated via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. On January, 30 th , 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) a public health emergency of international concern, and on March 11 th , WHO Director General referred to COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of May 5 th , 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 3 million worldwide, with more than 250,000 COVID-19-related deaths. The epidemic has put public health systems under severe strain both in western countries and in the developing world. SARS-CoV-2 displays a more efficient transmission pattern when compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [5] , retaining a high transmission rate also in the asymptomatic incubation period [6] . The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 syndrome varies remarkably, going from asymptomatic forms to acute bilateral pneumonias requiring hospitalization. Common presenting symptoms include fever, fatigue and dry cough, while laboratory tests often show lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Chest computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. A significant percentage of cases requires admission to intensive-care-units (ICU) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation support. A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 can experience the so-called \"cytokine storm syndrome\", characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia associated with multi-organ failure.",

It seems not casual that the term cytokine storm was first employed in describing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the events modulating the onset of the graft-versus-host disease [8] , a condition characterized by an impressively powerful activation of the immune system. Cytokine storms characterize a wide spectrum of infectious and non-infectious diseases, and since 2005, it was associated to the avian H5N1 influenza virus infection [9] .

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating event, with an estimated mortality of approximately 40%, defined as the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates and severe hypoxemia. ARDS can occur in a variety of clinical situations, including pneumonia, sepsis, pancreatitis, blood transfusion. ARDS pathogenesis involves inflammatory injury to the alveolo-capillary membrane, which results in increased lung permeability and the exudation of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid into the airspaces, leading in the end to respiratory insufficiency [12] .",

As far as COVID 19 infection is concerned, Huang et al recently reported that infected patients also show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [4] . The demonstration of increased levels of IL-1B, IFN\u03b3, CXCL10, and CCL2 strongly pointed toward an activation of T-helper-1 (Th1) cell function. More importantly, the so called \"cytokine storm\" emerged as a main factor driving a more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f severe clinical course. This concept originated from the observation that COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission displayed higher concentrations of CXCL10, CCL2 and TNF\u03b1 as compared to those in which the infection was less severe and did not require an ICU admission. To further complicate the issue, it should be highlighted that, in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, at difference from SARS-CoV infection, there is also an increased secretion Th2-immune-oriented cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, whose main effect is to suppress inflammation [14] .",

They mediate the traffic of immune cells to the site of the infection, induce the increase of the acute phase signaling, activate epithelial cells and mediate the production of secondary cytokines [21] . Among them, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) deserves a more extensive discussion in view of its involvement in the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm. IL-6 is crucially involved in acute inflammation due to its role in regulating the acute phase response [21] . It is produced by almost all stromal cells and B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells and other non-lymphocytic cells, such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, glomerular Mesangial cells and tumor cells [22] . The production of this cytokine is increased by IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) [23] . IL-6 may also be responsible for the activation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells in the dendritic cell-T cell interaction [24] . In COVID-19 affected patients, a high TH17 cells activation could result from a virus-driven increased production of IL-6 by the immune system. IL-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm owing to its pleiotropic properties. Several studies showed that the serum levels of IL-6 are increased in COVID-19 patients and that its circulating levels are positively related to disease severity [14, 25, 26] . For this reason, high serum IL-6 levels were suggested as predictors for disease severity [27, 28] . Indeed, in animal models of SARS-CoV infection, the inhibition of the transcription factor of IL-6 and, in turn of its production, was associated with reduced mortality [29] .",

Several studies also showed that the intratracheal injection of mob-1 in mice induced pulmonary migration of leukocytes in the alveolar space, with massive recruitment of neutrophils, especially monocytes. This event was rapidly followed by microvascular injury and pulmonary edema typical of ARDS [35, 36] . CXCL10 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the onset of ARDS, as shown in mice models of ARDS induced by either acid aspiration or by viral infection (with influenza H5N1 virus). Briefly, Ichikawa et al, demonstrated that wild-type mice developing ARDS had increased levels of CXCL10 mainly due to an increased secretion by infiltrating neutrophils, which induced an autocrine loop mechanism on the chemotaxis of inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. On the contrary, CXCL10 and/or its receptor CXCR3 knock-out mice showed decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to both viral and non-viral lung injury [37] . Moreover, CXCL10 expression in the lung was significantly up-regulated after induction of ARDS with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a mouse model of lung injury, and the neutralization of CXCL10 with anti-CXCL10 antibody lead to amelioration of lung injury [38] .",

Chemokines play an important role in the inflammatory response by attracting leukocytes to sites of infection. These small proteins also contribute to the homeostatic circulation of leukocytes through tissues [31] . At present, 50 chemokines and 20 chemokine receptors have been recognized and classified. Chemokines are named according to the most recent nomenclature, which classifies them according to their chemical structure, the C, CC CXC and CX3C families [48] . The binding of chemokines to their receptors is responsible for their chemoattractant ability. The chemokine receptors belong to the seven-transmembrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors, which are expressed primarily on leukocytes but also on other cells, e.g., endothelial cells [49] . The many functions of chemokines include the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, the regulation of angiogenesis and immune and inflammatory responses, tumor growth and metastasis [50] [51] [52] . Most recently, several studies investigated the involvement of chemokines in coronavirus-related infective disease. It emerged that specific chemokines could play a crucial role in the development of COVID-19-related symptoms, thus confirming what previously known for other types of coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS. [13, 53] . These findings could be somehow expected in view of the well-known role of chemokines in viral infections.",

Chemokines also recruit immune cells to the site of infection, which will fight against the intruder [55] . Viral infections are associated with enhanced expression of several chemokines, in particular the interferons-inducible ones. Interferons, which can be produced by any mammalian cell, are involved in the rapid and efficient host innate response against viruses. A powerful IFN response triggered by the first contact with a virus can slow down viral multiplication and \"buy time\" for the organism to establish a more efficient adaptive immune response [56] . IFNs can stimulate surrounding cells to express potent antiviral proteins including enzymes, transcription factors, cell surface glycoproteins, cytokines and chemokines [57, 58] . Moreover, they can inhibit cell proliferation, regulate apoptosis and modulate the immune response [59] . Among interferons-induced molecules, the chemokine CXCL10 is currently regarded as a main player in the organism anti-viral response [60] , and particularly in respiratory tract infections.",

            "text": "Since the first reports of SARS, it seemed clear that the severe clinical manifestations of the disease could not be ascribed only to the viral activity per se, but that an immune-mediated mechanism rather than a direct virus-induced damage would drive the clinical progression [67] . Indeed from the physio-pathology point of view, the most interesting observation was the demonstration that viral titers seemed to paradoxically diminish during the most severe phase of the disease both in humans and in several animal models [1] . Data In vivo studies showed that several circulating chemokines (CXCL8, CCL2 and CXCL10) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12) were elevated in patients with SARS-CoV [68, 69] . CXCL10 was also considered an excellent prognostic marker for SARS disease progression [70, 71] . In particular, Jiang et al showed that CXCL 10 serum levels were significantly increased during the early stage of SARS, and remained elevated until resolution. Moreover, persistently elevated CXCL10 serum levels during follow-up were predictive of a worse outcome of the infection [71] These findings prompted further in vitro studies aimed at investigating the relationship between SARS and the chemokine system. Spiegel et al, demonstrated that, in addition to its direct effect on epithelial lung cells, SARS-CoV could also enter macrophages and dendritic cells [72] . This appeared crucial as viral entrance in these cells lead to an abortive infection (e.g. the virus enters the host-cell but cannot successfully complete replication). Yet the virus elicited the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines by dendritic and macrophages cells [73] . This finding was confirmed in vivo because the serum levels of a wide spectrum of cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and macrophages were elevated in SARS-CoV infected patients [74] . Furthermore, the infection with SARS-CoV of human primary myeloid-derived dendritic cells was followed by an impaired defensive IFN\u03b2 response, which was paralleled by a moderate up-regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and a much more significant up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines (such as CXCL10, CCL3, CCL5, and CCL2) [75] . The authors suggested that the lack of response to antiviral interferons in the presence of chemokine up-regulation could represent a further mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV [73] . In line with this hypothesis, the direct exposure of lung epithelial cells [76] or Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) [75] coming from SARS infected patients to viral proteins (such as S-protein and N-protein) induced a prompt release of several chemokines, including CXCL8 and CXCL10. In vitro gene-expression studies also reported that PBMC from normal healthy donors inoculated with SARS-CoV showed an early enhancement in the expression of several chemokines belonging both to the CC family (CCL4, CCL20, CCL22, CCL25, CCL27, and their receptors J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CCR4, CCR7) and of the CXCL family (CXCL8 and IL-17) [77] . Additional data came from animal models of SARS-CoV infection. In mice infected with SARS-CoV, the clinical features of the syndrome showed an age-dependent increase in severity (similarly to what observed in humans), which was related to an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, paralleled by a reduction in T-cell responses [78] .",

Hopefully, the advances in our comprehension of the mechanisms sustaining the clinical course and patients-related factors driving the final outcome will be helpful in developing effective preventive strategies and/or therapeutical options. Based on current knowledge, the \"cytokine storm\" appears as one of the most dangerous and potentially lifethreatening event related to COVID-19 sustaining its major clinical consequences. The immune mediated events related to the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the role of the chemokine/chemokine receptor system, will be further and more extensively characterized with the final goal to identify targeted therapeutic strategies. Although lessons from the previous SARS and MERS epidemics can be drawn, there is still much to do in order to conclude whether SARS-CoV-2 virus behaves in the same way of its predecessors or if it is characterized by peculiar specificities. Clearly, the hide-and-seek challenge between the virus and our immune defenses will also help us understanding the extremely variable spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, which appears to range between asymptomatic cases to possibly lethal bilateral pneumonia with multi-organ failure.

Although preliminary, the available data provided by both clinical and in vitro studies suggest possible similarities between what was observed after SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov infection. Overall, an increased production of pro-inflammatory chemokines (mainly CXCL10 and CXCL8) seems to characterize also COVID-19 infection. There are few in vitro studies regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection published so far. The results of a study comparing SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses behavior in the lung tissue should be overviewed.",

            "text": "Chen et al, recently characterized the immunological features of COVID-19 patients with different severity of the disease. Briefly, the 11 patients with severe disease displayed significantly higher serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 and lower absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells as compared with the 10 patients with moderate disease. Of note, severe cases were characterized by a lower expression of IFN-\u03b3 by CD4+ T cells as compared with moderate cases. [98] Xiong et al performed a transcriptome sequencing analysis of several pro-inflammatory genes in both PMCs and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19, compared with samples form healthy donors. The authors reported that COVID-19 patients showed up-regulation of genes encoding for several immuneregulatory molecules, in particular CXCL10, in PBMCs whereas no up-regulation of CXCL10 gene was observed in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Moreover, an up-regulation of several genes involved in apoptosis and P53 signaling pathways in PBMC was observed, leading to the hypothesis that this process could be the underlying cause of lymphopenia commonly observed in COVID-19 patients. [99]. Another study by Wang et al, including 65 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients showed that the absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells progressively decreased in relation with increasing severity of illness. [100]. In this view, the findings recently reported by Yang et al. appear of potential clinical relevance. Indeed, several cytokine/chemokine levels were measured and found to be elevated in patients with different clinical severity of the COVID-19. Among them, CXCL10, CCL7 and IL-1 receptor antagonist were the ones significantly related to disease severity and even more importantly, CXCL10 levels were the only one to be positively and significantly correlated with the viral load (Yang, et al. 2020).",
