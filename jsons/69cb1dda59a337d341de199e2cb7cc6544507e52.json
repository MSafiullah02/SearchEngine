The genesis of classical cold symptoms such as rhinorhea, nasal blockage, sore throat and cough following infection is not defined but may be the result of kinin release and other vasoactive substances induced by rhinovirus [Naclerio et al., 1988] . However, initial rhinovirus infection occurs in the airway mucosa and release of other permeability factors from epithelial and fibroblast cells may explain the development of rhinorrhea at an early stage, usually within 48 hr [Grunberg and Sterk, 1999] . This is feasible because early innate responses to rhinovirus are characterized by release of a variety of mediators including the neutrophil chemokines interleukin 8 (IL-8) [Johnston et al., 1998 ] and epithelium neutrophil-activating peptide-78 (ENA-78) [Donninger et al., 2003; Ghildyal et al., 2005] , and cytokines IL-6 and IL-11 [Zhu et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1999] . Other investigations have demonstrated that the eosinophil chemokine regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) is produced by airway epithelium following rhinovirus infection [Konno et al., 2002] . However, release and the role of mediators of vascular leakage are still unclear .",

            "text": "One of the potent proteins involved in vascular growth and remodeling is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF induces endothelial cell proliferation, augments cell migration, and reduces apoptosis [Gerhardt and Betsholtz, 2005; Ribatti, 2005] . VEGF also increases the permeability of endothelial cells, a response now known to be mediated via induction of blood vessel fenestration and the formation of channels through which blood products can extravasate [Feng et al., 1999] . VEGF can be produced by a variety of cells that include epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, granulocytes, and smooth muscle cells [Horiuchi and Weller, 1997; Neufeld et al., 1999] . In highly vascular tissues such as lung, VEGF appears to be produced in significant quantities [Maniscalco et al., 1995] . VEGF has also been linked to airway diseases including asthma [Choi et al., 2004] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [Kranenburg et al., 2005] . Lee et al. [2000] demonstrated production of VEGF in epithelial cells by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection but the investigators were unable to elicit VEGF responses from epithelial cells following rhinovirus infection. However, alternative cellular sources of VEGF such as mucosal fibroblasts may also contribute to VEGF production following rhinovirus infection and we have recently demonstrated its induction by rhinovirus in airway fibroblasts .",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections caused by rhinovirus, RSV, coronavirus, adenovirus, and a variety of other 'common cold' viruses induce characteristic symptoms. Increases in nasal secretions are universal manifestations of infection, often accompanied by nasal blockage and sore throat and less often by constitutional symptoms. The genesis of a 'runny nose' is poorly understood and has been ascribed to the release of kinins [Naclerio et al., 1988] and other vasoactive substances such as leukotriene C4 [Skoner et al., 1995; Gentile et al., 2003] . The potent effects of the angiogenic factor VEGF on vascular permeability have been characterized and found to be more than a 1000-fold greater than histamine [Senger et al., 1990] . If produced during viral infections it may explain some of the explosive vascular leakage found 24-72 hr after initial exposure to the causative agent. The present studies first evaluated VEGF responses in epithelial cells, both in a cell line (HeLa) and in primary bronchial epithelial cells. Significant amounts of VEGF protein were produced in both types of cells in culture (2,500-10,000 pg/ml) but this was not increased after infection with rhinovirus. These findings are similar to studies by Lee et al. [2000] who could not detect rhinovirus induced VEGF release by epithelial cells. However, the data pertaining to rhinovirus infection was not shown in the report and it is not clear whether VEGF increased in non-infected and infected cells over time as shown in the current study. An important issue to consider is whether necrosis of rhinovirus-infected cells may reduce cell numbers precluding measurable increases in VEGF, a possibility that was investigated by measuring LDH release into the culture supernatant. However, levels of LDH were not increased in rhinovirus infection. In contrast, infection with rhinovirus serotype 2 (a minor group rhinovirus) caused substantial cell death with an increase in LDH and a late decrease of VEGF release (data not shown), a finding not observed after rhinovirus 16 infections. The difference noted in the same experimental context provides additional evidence to verify that cell death did not cause lack of VEGF release. Taken together, the study of Lee et al. [2000] and data presented now suggest that rhinovirus does not induce release of VEGF from epithelial cells.",

Fibroblasts act as sentinel cells and provide early innate immune responses following infections [Smith et al., 1997] . Based on these considerations studies have previously investigated and reported the role of fibroblasts in tissue responses to rhinovirus; these studies detected release of the key neutrophil chemokine ENA-78. In tandem with ENA-78 release and over similar time courses there was production of VEGF following rhinovirus infection . In the current studies, these investigations were extended Fig. 3 . VEGF measurements in nasal aspirates. Nasal aspirates obtained from patients with verified respiratory tract infection (rhinovirus or RSV or a combination of both) were compared with patients negative for both viruses. Rhinovirus alone did not induce a significant increase in VEGF compared to non-infected subjects. However, RSV in combination with rhinovirus induced a significant increase in VEGF. Filled squares, no infection; filled triangles, rhinovirus infection only; filled inverted triangles, RSV infection only; filled diamonds, RSV and rhinovirus infection. and VEGF responses to rhinovirus infection in a fibroblast cell line, the fetal cell line MRC5 were compared. Infection with rhinovirus did not induce VEGF to levels above a time-dependent increase of VEGF in mock and UV-RV16 treated cells ( Fig. 2A) . It suggests that VEGF responses in primary culture fibroblasts and in a fibroblast cell line are discordant and that human primary airway cells (although difficult to obtain and culture) are required to assess initial cellular activities following rhinovirus infection in a comprehensive fashion. The disparity is not unusual and there are several reports noting differences in the reaction of cell lines and primary culture cells following infection [Vitkovic et al., 1995; Richardson et al., 1996] and in response to other stimuli [Hermanns et al., 2004; Kartsogiannis and Ng, 2004; Shapiro, 2004] .",

The isoforms may differ in their biologic functions and expression following infection and hence we examined production of isoforms following rhinovirus infection of primary fibroblasts. Using RT PCR and primers designed to detect all isoforms we could identify assay products on gel electrophoresis that were consistent with production of isoforms 121, 145, 165, and 186/189 aa. Detection of the protein isoforms was also attempted but not successful. Our data suggest that similar isoforms are produced (121 and 165) as reported in response to RSV [Lee et al., 2000] but that RT-PCR identifies also the 145 and 183/189 proteins. This is most likely because these isoforms remain cell and/or matrix associated in vitro and in vivo [Dvorak, 2000] . Rhinovirus induces additional isoforms in fibroblasts implying that detection of protein moieties only may not provide information on all the isoforms. However, it remains to be established that these mRNA isoforms are translated to produce VEGF protein.",

            "text": "To assess whether rhinovirus infection of airway cells is relevant to events in human rhinovirus disease, studies were undertaken to determine nasal VEGF levels in a cohort of children with confirmed rhinovirus associated asthma exacerbation [Kling et al., 2005] . RSV infection was studied as a positive control because RSV is known to increase nasal VEGF [Lee et al., 2000 ] and children without rhinovirus or RSV were included as a control group for comparison. VEGF levels were low in patients with absent rhinovirus or RSV and also in those in whom rhinovirus RNA only was detected. In the latter group only two patients had a slight increase in VEGF detectable. It is possible that VEGF proteins had been degraded in the nasal aspirates containing rhinovirus. However, elevated levels of VEGF were observed in aspirates containing both rhinovirus and RSV; aspirates obtained from the same cohort of asthmatics with handling and storage in an identical fashion. Patients with RSV had significantly higher levels of VEGF in the nose; others have reported comparable findings in patients with RSV infection, but not with influenza infection or when either virus was absent [Lee et al., 2000] . Of note was that 5/6 patients with RSV had both RSV/rhinovirus present; unfortunately the cohort contained only one patient with RSV infection alone; thus it is not possible to judge the contribution of dual infection to increases in VEGF. This data implies that complex interactive events influence human responses to virus infection; aspects that merit investigation in future employing in vitro models. Interestingly, a study of acute asthma found elevated levels of sputum VEGF during asthma exacerbations though the role of viruses as a cause of the increases was not investigated [Lee and Lee, 2001] . Overall results suggest that measurable nasal VEGF is induced by RSV infections but not by other viruses such as rhinovirus or influenza.",

However, the in vivo data presented indicate that measurable VEGF is not present in the airway lumen (of the nose) following rhinovirus infection and hence there is some discrepancy between these results. One explanation may involve the anatomical position of fibroblasts relative to epithelium because if most of the VEGF following rhinovirus infection is generated in submucosal fibroblasts, mediators such as VEGF may not penetrate the basement membrane and epithelial layers to appear in luminal fluid. In contrast, if VEGF is generated mostly in epithelium, as with RSV infection, detection may be possible. Finally, considerable dilution of mediators occurs when nasal aspirates and washes are obtained, this may vary as much as 50 times [Hendley and Gwaltney, 2004] and would influence measurements if low levels of VEGF are present.",
