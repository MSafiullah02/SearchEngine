Accurate clinical diagnosis of acute viral respiratory infection is challenging because of overlap of symptoms associated with various viruses and overlap with symptoms associated with other illnesses. Flu A, Flu B and RSV are clinically most important since they are the most frequently encountered, they cause substantial disease burden and a targeted treatment exists. Using a first-line method with a high sensitivity and short TAT to guarantee a result 24 h a day/7 days per week for these pathogens could be of considerable clinical importance. Many commercial as well as in-house developed assays are available, including the Simplexa\u2122 Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay system (FDA-cleared), a real-time RT-PCR system that enables the direct amplification, detection and differentiation of Flu A, Flu B and RSV virus RNA from unprocessed nasopharyngeal swabs (no separate sample extraction steps are required). This system could also be used as a point-of-care test.",

In this study, the Simplexa\u2122 Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay system showed comparable performance characteristics for Flu A, Flu B and RSV in comparison with TAC testing. The four samples missed by Simplexa\u2122 in this study had a low viral load (median cycle threshold of 34), suggesting a slightly lower sensitivity of the assay in comparison with that of the TAC assay. A possible explanation could be the simple lysis of the sample with insufficient viral RNA return compared to a real extraction of the nucleic acids. The TAC technology targets a large panel of viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory pathogens. Logically, the diagnostic yield of this multi-pathogen molecular method was much higher compared to that of DFA and Simplexa\u2122 testing which target only a limited number of pathogens. Also, in almost one-third of the Simplexa\u2122 positive samples, TAC detected Flu A and the presence of an additional pathogen. Respiratory co-infections, in particular, the association of Flu A with (an)other viral, bacterial or fungal pathogen(s), could be associated with longer hospital stay, a longer ICU stay and even higher mortality (Shah et al., 2016, Echenique et al., 2013, Crotty et al., 2015). Detecting these co-infections could have an important clinical impact. Performing a method that allows a syndromic approach on all samples \u2013 or at least those coming from specific patient populations such as those included in this study \u2013 would be diagnostically valuable. When comparing TAC results from this study with those from previous winter season (Steensels et al., 2015), the overall positivity rate was comparable (62 versus 66.4%).",

DFA requires experienced lab technicians and is labor intensive. In our lab, DFA is only performed during regular laboratory operating hours and not in weekends, so it can take up to 2\u20133 days to have a result if the sample is taken on a Friday evening. On the other hand, the Simplexa\u2122 direct assay system is an all-in-one system (no separate sample extraction steps needed) which requires minimal hands-on-time and results are available in about 1 h 15 min from the start of a test run. The assay is easy to perform, without the need of specialized equipment or experienced molecular lab technicians, so it can easily be performed 24 h a day/7 days per week, and even as point-of-care test. Performing the Simplexa\u2122 assay as first-line test would guarantee a fast result for Flu A, Flu B and RSV, regardless of the sampling timing. Having a fast negative result for these pathogens could also result in cost savings thanks to reduced time spent in isolation, shorter length of inpatient stay and a faster discontinuation of empiric antiviral therapy such as oseltamivir (Pettit et al., 2015). For TAC testing, a separate nucleic acid extraction step is required, as are specialized equipment and lab technicians, and samples cannot be treated individually in the TAC format, so a same-day-result cannot always be guaranteed. Nevertheless, laboratories with a high respiratory sample turn-over could ensure an acceptable TAT, providing their clinicians with a much more complete result.",

            "text": "Even though molecular methods still have a significant higher cost than conventional methods such as DFA, it is important to point out the reasonable cost of the TAC technology considering the large number of agents detectable. The TAC method is actually the least expensive in terms of cost per pathogen. In addition, the gain in sensitivity and diagnostic yield could improve patient outcomes and could reduce overall costs for the hospital, making it cost-effective (Olofsson et al., 2011, Mahony et al., 2009). The added cost of testing with a multi-pathogen panel such as the TAC assay should be weighed against the potential benefits of increased identification of the causative pathogen(s). Even though targeted antiviral treatment not always exists, other treatment options such as antifungals or corticosteroids could be important. In addition, the diagnosis of a viral respiratory infection can potentially reduce the use of antibiotics (Gelfer et al., 2015, Falsey et al., 2013, Rogers et al., 2015), it can assist infection control practitioners in providing appropriate infection control measures (e.g. droplet and/or contact precautions and considerations in creating cohorts) and it can stop the more thorough search for a diagnosis avoiding unnecessary medical procedures. Moreover, co-infections are routinely reported using multi-pathogen molecular assays (Chung et al., 2007, Mahony et al, 2007, Pierangeli et al., 2007). Testing for multiple pathogens in a single assay may also provide a savings of resources including technologist time and expendables and cost less than the aggregate cost of performing multiple uniplex PCR tests. And finally, these tests will contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical importance of respiratory tract infections. Many commercial as well as in-house developed assays exist today which offer a syndromic approach for the detection of respiratory pathogens. Each system has its advantages and disadvantages, and each user should determine which system is appropriate for their specific laboratory and/or patient population. However, more studies will be needed to determine populations or situations in which these methods would be the most useful in order to optimize their clinical and financial impact (Valli\u00e8res and Renaud, 2013). Several testing algorithms could be proposed. Ideally, the TAC technology or another comparable multi-pathogen method would be performed on all patient samples with a guaranteed result within 24 h. Another option would be to perform the Simplexa\u2122 assay 24 h a day/7 days a week as a first-line test in winter period for all patients, and to reserve the more complete TAC technology for specific patient populations such as immunocompromised patients, patients in ICU, neonates, etc.",
