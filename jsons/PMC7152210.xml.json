Clinical disease results from dysregulation of the mucosal immune response. The umbrella term IBD used in ferrets and other small animals for a variety of gastrointestinal diseases is not the same disease that is seen in humans. Clinical signs, origin, endoscopic features, and histopathologic features are very different from those seen in humans. Continued use of the term IBD for these diseases in small animals is a source of frustration and confusion to clinicians and pathologists alike.",

Many genetically susceptible humans, mice, and dogs have defects in intracellular pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (e.g., toll-like receptors [TLRs] and nuclear organization domain receptors [NODs]) that are responsible for clearing virulent and commensal bacteria. It is thought that this inability to clear commensal bacteria leads to chronic immune stimulation and harmful cytokine release, resulting in disease.\n",

Subjective impressions of increased numbers of leukocytes within the lamina propria represent the least reliable but the most widely used criterion for a diagnosis, simply because most biopsy samples do not have any other mucosal abnormalities.\u2022Histopathologic features that are wrongly interpreted as IBD include increased numbers of lamina propria lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils; increased numbers of goblet cells; villous blunting; and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in normal ferrets, older animals, and animals with numerous and different gastrointestinal diseases.\u2022Histopathologic features of Crohn's disease involve the deeper layers of the bowel wall with fissures, sinus tracts, fistulas, and fibrosis, all of which may produce radiographically or endoscopically evident areas of mural thickening and/or luminal stenosis. Most of these features cannot be evaluated in mucosal biopsy specimens and require full-thickness biopsies. Often seen are the following: a mixed inflammatory infiltrate; cryptitis and microabscesses; lymphoid aggregates; branching atrophic crypts; and Paneth cell metaplasia. Crohn's disease will also exhibit granulomas in the ileum or the colon that are unassociated with crypt rupture; disproportionate submucosal inflammation; transmural lymphoid infiltrates; and serositis.\u2022Ulcerative colitis involves the mucosa in a diffuse and continuous fashion and always affects the rectum.\u2022Colonoscopy reveals erythema, edema, obscured normal vascular pattern, multiple ulcers and/or strictures, and stenosis.\u2022Other causes of diarrhea should be ruled out by using the appropriate tests (fecal flotation, fecal culture, food trials, serology, and endoscopy).\u2022Refer to appropriate section/topic for specific diseases.\n",
