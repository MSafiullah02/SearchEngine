            "text": "van Regenmortel et al., 2000). Influenza virus (family Myxoviridae) or respiratory syncytial virus (family Paramyxoviridae), for example, have helical nucleocapsids. Although each virus has two glycoproteins in the envelope, one of which is cleaved by furin during transport or assembly, these two glycoproteins do not interact during assembly. Instead, each glycoprotein forms spikes that consist of homomultimers. The assembled virions are not uniform in composition or structure. Rather than forming regular structures in which the envelope proteins are present in quasi-equivalent positions, virions are pleomorphic and do not have a fixed composition. Retroviruses, such as HIV, use yet another assembly mechanism. The immature nucleocapsids are assembled using radial symmetry and are not icosahedral in structure (Wilk et al., 2001). The glycoproteins do not form a regular icosahedral lattice and the final composition of the virion is not rigorously constrained. In fact, nucleocapsids will bud in the absence of glycoproteins. Thus, it is possible that the ability to form a regular icosahedral, enveloped virus may have arisen only once. It is interesting to note that hepatitis C virus (genus Hepacivirus, family Flaviviridae), Cryoelectron Microscopic Reconstruction of an Alphavirus Virion (Ross River Virus) which is only distantly related to the members of the Comparison of the Genome Organizations of a Tobamovirus (Tobacco Mosaic Virus) and an Alphavirus (Sindbis Virus) genus Flavivirus, is also thought to possess a glycopro-multiple recombination events in which new proteins tein with the same fold as the flavivirus E protein (Yagnik have been introduced from other viruses or from the et al., 2000).
