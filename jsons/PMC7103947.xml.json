Throat swabs were taken and assessed for the presence of the coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E. These swabs were used as the only respiratory sample to avoid potential difficulties in the interpretation of the results based on the sample type. The throat swabs were sent to the laboratory in a viral transport medium (MTV, Vircell, Granada, Spain). Only one sample per patient was considered. The samples were processed to detect the various respiratory viruses using a real-time genomic amplification technique (commercial real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kit), which provides simultaneous and differential detection of 16 different respiratory viruses (Anyplex RV16, Seegene, South Korea). Blood cultures were performed for patients with suspected pneumonia, and serological determinations for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were conducted. The medical records and epidemiological data of the patients with coronavirus were reviewed. The statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test and Student's t-test for paired data. Values of p\n < .05 were considered significant.",

However, in Brazil, these viruses only represented 1.2% of the cases studied from 2009 to 2010,9 while in China, the rates were 4.4%10 and 11.7%11 for a pediatric population and an adult population, respectively. In a study performed in Canada,12 coronaviruses only represented 2% of the respiratory samples from adults, which is consistent with that observed by Gaunt et al.13 in Great Britain (2.3%). However, all of these estimates generally refer to the rate of positivity for a total number of samples analyzed. Thus for the Gaunt et al. study,13 the rate of etiologic participation of the coronaviruses rose to 8.1% of all the samples positive to any virus. In our study, we detected coronaviruses in 6.9% of the enrolled patients and in 12.6% of those in whom a virus was demonstrated, with readings very close to those measured in neighboring countries, such as France.8\n",
