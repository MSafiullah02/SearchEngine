Here we have discussed about the spread of COVID-2019 epidemic in great detail using Euler's method. The Euler's method is a method of solution of ordinary differential equations. The SIR model has the combination of three ordinary differential equations. In this study, we have used the data of COVID-2019 Outbreak of India on 8th May, 2020. In this data, we have used 135710 susceptible cases, 54340 infectious cases and 1830 reward/removed cases for the initial level of experimental purpose. Data about a wide variety of infectious diseases has been analyzed with the help of SIR model. Therefore, this model has already been well tested for infectious diseases. Using the data on the number of COVID-2019 outbreak cases in India, the results obtained from the analysis and simulation of the proposed model show that the COVID-2019 epidemic cases increase for some time and thereafter this outbreak will decrease. The results obtained from the SIR model also suggest that the Euler's method can be used to predict transmission and prevent the COVID-2019 epidemic in India. Finally, from this study, we have found that the outbreak of COVID-2019 epidemic in India will be at its peak on 25 May 2020 and after that it will work slowly and on the verge of ending in the first or second week of August 2020.",

Almost the entire population of the world is currently using lockdown, social distancing and masks to stop this epidemic. India is also using such resources to fight this epidemic at the moment. The COVID-19 epidemic is a member of SARS-Cov-2 family. No medicine has been prepared for this disease yet. COVD-2019 is an epidemic spreads from one human to another at a very rapid speed due to the breathing or contact of an infected person. Hence COVID-2019 is a contagious disease. The incubation period of this disease is 2 to 1 4 days. In a recent study, it has been found that the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 epidemic is estimated at about 2-3%. This disease proves fatal for people above 60 years. The overall mortality rate for people above 40 years of age is about 27% [2, 3] . In India, on January 20, 2020, a patient of COVID-19 was found. This person came to Kerala from Wuhan city of China. The first case of COVID-19 was found at the end of November 2014 in Wuhan city of China. After 30 January 2020, the corona virus slowly spread in whole India.",

After this, the Prime Minister gave lockdown to India all over India till 14 April 20 20. Even after lockdown in India, COVID-19 epidemic patients continued to grow. Today, according to COVID-19 epidemic data in India which was available on Indian council of medical research (ICMR) website, 81970 are infected, 27920 were cured and 2649 people died on 15 May 2020. However, India has a much larger population density than other countries and apart from this; medical facilities are not available in sufficient quantity. Therefore, the risk of spreading corona virus is very high here. Despite all these, corona infection in India is very less compared to other countries. In recent studies, it has been found that the cause of corona virus infection in India is low due to warm climate as well as humidity [4, 5] , Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and a large amount of young population [6] . Due to all this, the resistance of people here is very high compared to other countries. All these studies are preliminary studies and no scientific evidence of this type of study is available till now [7] . Hence there is a need to study COVID-2019 outbreak with more evidence now. In this study we have presented an epidemic model based on sir method of COVID-19 spread to India. Most epidemics have an initial exponential curve and then gradually flatten out [8] . In this proposed study, we have also considered the effects of social distancing on the growth of infections, lockdown and face mask India. India announced a countrywide lockdown on March 24 for 21 days although a study has suggested that this period may be insufficient for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [9] . In the present study, we have assumed the effects of social distancing measures, lockdown and face cover from the time of spread to India. Hence there is a need to study COVID-2019 with more evidence now. In this proposed study, we have presented an epidemic model based on SIR method of COVID-19 spread to India. The proposed SIR model has three differential equations. The solution of such type of differential equation is difficult and time consuming. Therefore we have used Euler's method for solving these three differential equations. Most epidemics have an initial exponential curve and then gradually flatten out. The objectives of these studies are given below:",

These are the assumptions of SIR model regarding the COVID-2019 outbreak of India. Therefore from the above two assumptions, we can say that the behavior of COVID-2019 outbreak of India depends on the values of following expression: (10) This quantity is known as the threshold number. In this present study we have defined another quantity called reproductive number which is denoted by and defined by the following expression (10) . This is the number of secondary infectives of COVID-2019 outbreak produced by one primary infective in the susceptible populations.

On the basis of the data obtained by this model, it would be wrong to say that the COVID-2019 outbreak in India will go on because people here today are neither following social distancing nor applying their face masks. Hence this epidemic threat is very high risk in India. This study also shows that if locking, social distancing and masks etc. are used properly in India, then the outbreak of COVID-2019 epidemic can be almost eliminated in the first or second week of August 2020. This proposed study is very useful for the future prediction of outbreak of COVID-2019. This proposed SIR model will automatically estimates the number of cases of weekly, bi-weekly, month and even year.
