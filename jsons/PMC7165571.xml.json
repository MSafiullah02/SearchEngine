At present, the most efficacious treatment regimen for SARS, if any, is unknown. For patients with progressive deterioration, intensive and supportive care is of primary importance. In Hong Kong, antibiotics were given to patients suspected of having SARS; once the patients progressed to the severe stage and experienced shortness of breath, vibavirin and steroids were used.\n2\n Some patients had progressed to a severe stage of the disease, characterized by oxygen desaturation. They required intensive care and ventilatory support for a mean period of 6.4 days.\n3\n, \n4\n\n",

The within\u2010case analysis was performed by identifying the important variables and associations in relation to the case. Different tactics of analysis, including clustering, noting themes and patterns, and making comparisons of variables, were employed. The next step was the cross\u2010case analysis, where the data on the cases were compared and contrasted with noted generalizations and particularities. The basic reason for employing a cross\u2010case analysis is to allow the researcher to explore the subject more fully and to deepen understanding of the relevant issues.",

Isolation was found to be a source of stress because it led to boredom, loneliness and frustration. Having control over information was important for the patients as it gave them the feeling that they were maintaining some sort of control over themselves. From the findings, it seems that holding perceptions of support from health\u2010care professionals, family members and friends, having a trusting attitude towards the physicians and the treatment, being informed about one's progress and having a balanced attitude towards the illness all directly help the patient cope with the illness.",
