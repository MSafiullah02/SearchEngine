We also reported an alcohol-induced ONFH rat model and that the TLR4 signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced ONFH [10]. Furthermore, we reported that ONFH results from the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) via the TLR signaling pathways, followed by a subsequent repression in NF-\u03baB activity by corticosteroid treatment, whereas IRF7 activity is unaffected by corticosteroid treatment. Further, the suppression of IRF7 activity by the use of an inhibitor, BAY11-7082, could interfere with the development of ONFH while maintaining the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids [9]. However, as rats co-administered with BAY11-7082 and corticosteroids showed high mortality, BAY11-7082 may be unsafe for human use. As new drug development requires an enormous amount of time and money, drug repositioning has been attracting a good deal of attention in recent years [11, 12].\n",

            "text": "It has been reported that innate immune signaling via TLR pathways contributes to the pathogenesis of underlying diseases in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH [8, 9]. Consequently, we previously reported that corticosteroid treatment after TLR4, TLR7 or TLR9 ligand injection induces ONFH in Wistar rats and that ONFH results from the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF7 via the MyD88-dependent pathway, followed by a subsequent repression in NF-\u03baB activity by corticosteroid treatment, whereas IRF7 activity is unaffected by corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, suppression of IRF7 activity using BAY11-7082, Ikk-\u03b1 inhibitor and Ikk-\u03b2 inhibitor with the potential to inhibit NF-\u03baB and IRF7 activity [22] interferes with the development of ONFH [9]. Thus, we believe that a proinflammatory response induced by corticosteroids leads to the development of ONFH. However, as the safety of BAY11-7082 has not been approved for humans, its clinical application is difficult. Therefore, we explored the use of an approved, commercially available drug, which has the potential to suppress IRF7 activity. It has been reported that LPZ exerts anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines via the suppression of NF-\u03baB activity [14]. Consequently, we hypothesized that LPZ also inhibits IRF7 activity and prevents ONFH development in rats, and this study showed that LPZ significantly suppressed IRF7 activity in the LPS + LPZ + MPSL and imiquimod + LPZ + MPSL groups compared with that in the LPS + MPSL and imiquimod + MPSL groups. This is consistent with previous reports on the effect of BAY11-7082 [9] and confirms that LPZ inhibits IRF7 activity. Further, NF-\u03baB activity was significantly suppressed in the LPS + LPZ + MPSL group only. We previously reported that corticosteroid treatment suppressed NF-\u03baB activity in imiquimod + MPSL rats compared with that in imiquimod + Saline rats [7]. This result indicates that LPS activates NF-\u03baB activity more than does imiquimod. Therefore, NF-\u03baB activity was significantly suppressed by LPZ treatment, and the co-treatment of LPZ with corticosteroids prevents the development of ONFH in rats. The results of the experimental study indicate that LPZ may also prevent the development of ONFH in patients with immune diseases needing corticosteroid treatment.",

These reports studied specific diseases, such as renal recipients, severe acute respiratory syndrome and SLE, so there is a possibility that specific treatments were provided for each group of patients. The present study could not determine whether the disappearance of ONFH was due to its natural course or the effects of LPZ, and ONFH patients need to be observed in a future clinical study.",

First, it was unclear whether the pharmacological effect of LPZ as prevention agent for osteonecrosis in rat models can be transferred to humans and there have been no reports to date. Second, the sample size was small, and it was a single-center and historically controlled study. Further, there were differences in underlying diseases in this study group from those in past reports, particularly, as a large number of patients with IgG4-related disease were included in this study. This is due to the high rate of patients treated for IgG4-related disease in our hospital. Furthermore, there was some bias in terms of underlying diseases between the study and control groups. Last, we could not evaluate transcriptional factor activity in the patients. Nevertheless, our clinical trial did show a decrease in the incidence of ONFH in our institute.",

Moreover, LPZ also prevents ONFH development in immune disease patients treated with corticosteroids, although the study was only preliminary. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct a multicenter clinical trial with large sample size. Nevertheless, we believe that LPZ is safe to use and could be effective in preventing osteonecrosis of the femoral head in patients needing corticosteroid treatment. We anticipate that further clinical trials will show that this protocol is both consistent and reproducible.",
