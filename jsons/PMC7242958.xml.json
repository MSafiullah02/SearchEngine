For patients with COVID-19 symptoms, protocols for immediate triage to testing, assessment and management plan discussion should be in place. RTTs should discuss the patients\u2019 fitness for continuation of RT with the responsible radiation oncologists. RT treatments may need to be deferred until symptoms resolve or may continue with the appropriate precautions in place.\u2022Patients wear their own personal face masks even when they do not have symptoms.

The wearing of a face mask should be considered not only for protection of RTTs, but primarily for patient safety.\u2022RTTs should be provided with personal protection equipment (PPE) as per national or WHO recommendations for treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 status. For treatments and procedures where there is a higher chance of droplet transmission, eye goggles and face shields should be considered. Examples of PPE recommendations are given in table 1\n. Strict hand hygiene must be followed before and after removing the PPE.\u2022Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 status should be treated on a separate treatment machine with its own entrance if possible. Alternatively, these patients can be treated at the end of the day to minimise any unnecessary contact between these patients and other COVID-19 negative patients.\u2022RTTs should be split into teams with no crossover of staff from one team to another. Additionally, a separate team can be assigned to duties without patient contact, to ensure that there is always one team available to provide the RT service if the other team needs to be quarantined.

Quality assurance and education activities should be carried out remotely if possible. Back-up staff for RT pre-treatment simulation and treatment machines should work from home until required. Such staff should have remote access to the main RT department for administrative duties. To provide an efficient and reliable telecommunication system between the RT department and remote access stations, RT departments need to optimise the ways of how to store relevant data electronically and safely. Caution should be taken during the exchange of confidential patient data.\u2022Where clinic review and follow up appointments are RTT-led, these should be conducted through telephone consultations/virtual meetings, in consensus with the radiation oncologists.\u2022An internal communications plan should be established to ensure continuous communication from the senior administration to clinical RTTs.

RTTs should escalate any suspicious findings to the responsible radiation oncologist when they review these images. Below are guidelines for necessary adaptions in RT practice in response to COVID-19.\u2022With the evolving COVID-19 outbreak, service continuity is of key importance. There should be a prospective re-organisation of departmental provisions to allow this, and to minimise the impact caused by a staff shortage due to sickness. A minimum of two RTTS should work on RT pre-treatment simulation and treatment machines.\u2022A Perspex shield at the treatment console should be erected so that RTTs can converse with patients while minimising any unnecessary physical contacts with patients. In addition, the Perspex shields can be placed at every point of contact between staff and patient where there may be closer than stipulated social distance measures.\u2022In order to minimise the chance of cross infection during RT, it is crucial to identify and promptly isolate subjects which are potentially COVID-19 contaminated in a RT department. In case of using spirometry-based breath-hold RT equipment, infection prevention and control teams should be consulted to check if the hygiene rules of treating patients with the equipment should be adapted. Specialist cleaning of all RT equipment and treatment rooms is required after RT delivery to patients with a COVID-19 suspected or confirmed status.\u2022Where additional personnel for online image guided RT (IGRT) decisions are required e.g. complex cases, gross anatomy changes, tumour displacement, these should be viewed and approved at a remote station.\u2022Recognised offline IGRT correction protocols should be used if daily online imaging is not possible, whilst ensuring that adequate coverage for uncertainty is maintained.\n",

To ensure RT departments continue to provide a safe and efficient service for the foreseeable future, there is a need to analyse solutions for the current pandemic, as described in the recommendations above. Imposed measurements in every regard, e.g. increased use of hypofractionation, postponement of treatment, increased hygiene and security regulations have to be revaluated and adapted according to the present situation and knowledge. Exploring new ways to react to further outbreaks is a prerequisite in long term planning. There needs to be ongoing monitoring of the situation within individual health organisations, in partnership with RTTs. COVID-19 protocols may require ultra-hypofractionated RT treatment schedules in conjunction with stereotactic body radiotherapy [13], [14].

The profession is being put under pressure to provide optimum care to patients and often are required to wear PPE for extended periods. RTTs can be in constant distress worrying if they will get infected or infect others at work and at home.
