In this context, Boivin et al.\n5\n reported the role of picornaviruses in flu\u2010like illnesses in adults.

The reasons identified were fear of adverse side\u2010effects from the vaccine, avoidance of medications and on individual belief of low susceptibility to influenza infection.\n2\n The major reason identified by another study of vaccination refusal in the Brazilian elderly was the misconception that the vaccine may cause influenza and the common concern about the \u2018non\u2010 effectiveness\u2019 to prevent \u2018flu and cold\u2019.\n13\n\n",

The frequency of rhinovirus infection is probably underestimated because coinfection in these influenza positive samples was not assessed. In addition, ILI clinical presentation was associated with rhinovirus infection in half of the study population and is likely to contribute to the misconceptions about influenza vaccine effectiveness, particularly during the influenza season, with there being high circulation of both viruses. As ILI in this study was the reason for a physician consultation, the high rate of these symptoms among rhinovirus infected patients may be overestimated. The design of the study did not allow investigation of rhinovirus infection in patients with mild symptoms. However, Boivin and collaborators did assess the role of rhinoviruses as a frequent pathogen associated with important respiratory and systemic symptoms among health volunteers, during the influenza season.\n5\n Those results strongly suggested that rhinovirus contributed to the maintenance of the myth that inactivated influenza vaccine could cause the flu.",
