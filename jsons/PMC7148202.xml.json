In 2013, the Associated Press (AP) Twitter account was hacked and published a tweet that two explosions rocked the White House and President was injured. The tweet led Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 143.5 points and Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index lost more than $136 billion in a short time period after the event [6]. In this paper, rumours refer to any unconfirmed information, including misinformation, regardless of the intention of the information source.",

Content-based methods focus on rumour detection using the textual contents of tweets and their user comments [12, 25, 30]. Generally tweet contents have direct signals for misinformation and content analysis for rumour detection is desirable. Feature-based models exploit features other than tweet contents such as author profile information for rumour detection [3, 9, 10, 13, 23]. Propagation-based methods exploit patterns in tweet propagation for rumour detection [14, 16, 18, 27]. Most existing approaches rely on large volumes of training data that are only possible when users have shown sufficient usage or tweets have been propagated for a while, and therefore are not designed for early detection.",

It is shown by previous research [30] that users post comments to tweets early and they contain questioning or enquiring phrases (e.g. \u201cIs this true?\u201d or \u201cReally?\u201d) that can be exploited for early detection of rumours.

Our main idea is to exploit the wisdom of the public crowd. As shown in previous studies [11, 30], the crowd shows attitudes such as disagreeing and questioning toward rumours. We therefore hypothesize that attitudes of the crowd to a tweet contains signals for identifying rumour tweets. We propose to mine the user comments to predict crowd attitudes and detect rumours. But we face the challenge that there do not exist annotations of attitudes for tweet comments. We specifically address the following research questions:Can crowd attitudes be exploited for effective early rumour detection?How to learn attitude representation from tweet comments without costly human annotation?\n",

We further propose CNN-BiLSTM and BERT neural models to integrate attitude representation and content representation for tweets and their comments for rumour detection.

Other studies [10, 13, 23] build time series model for information propagation and integrate other social and contextual features to detect rumours. Generally the feature-based approaches can be applied only when the original tweets have attracted significant attention on the social network after some time and therefore are not adequate for early detection of rumours or misinformation.",

Similarly if tweet C has \u201cFavour\u201d stance for topic A and tweet D has \u201cAgainst\u201d stance for topic A, then we generate an instance (tweet C, tweet D) with the label \u201cFavour-Against\u201d.

This can be explained by that for the true rumours, the stance information is harder to capture. It appears that the tree-structure neural network TD-RvNN model performs worse than our models in general. It confirms that the structural information can contribute the rumor detection to some extent, but for early detection, the average length of tree nodes can only get up to 5, and can not capture sufficient propagation signals for effective rumour detection.",

As shown in Fig. 6, Stance-BERT clearly performs better than BERT by grouping the same type of rumours into clusters. It confirms that transferred stance knowledge work effectively with rumour data.

We further propose CNN-BiLSTM and BERT-based models to integrate stance representation into the representation for tweets for rumour detection. Experiments on two public Twitter datasets showed that user comments contain early signals for detection rumour tweets. Especially our model based on BERT achieves consistently good performance for early rumour detection and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For future work, we will investigate making use of non-content information to further improve the performance of early rumour detection.",
