            "text": "Equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), genus Erbovirus, family Picornaviridae occurs as two serotypes, ERBV1 and ERBV2. An ERBV-specific nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that amplified a product within the 3D pol and 3 non-translated region of the viral genome was developed. The RT-PCR detected all 24 available ERBV1 isolates and one available ERBV2 isolate. The limit of detection for the prototype strain ERBV1.1436/71 was 0.1 50% tissue culture infectious doses. The RT-PCR was used to detect viral RNA in six of 17 nasopharyngeal swab samples from horses that had clinical signs of acute febrile respiratory disease but from which ERBV was not initially isolated in cell culture. The sequences of these six ERBV RT-PCR positive samples had 93-96% nucleotide identity with six other partially sequenced ERBV1 isolates and one ERBV2. ERBV was isolated from one of the six samples at fourth cell culture passage when it was shown that the addition of 20 mg/mL MgCl 2 to the cell culture medium enhanced the growth of the virus. This isolated virus was antigenically similar to ERBV2.313/75. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the P1 region of the genome also indicated that the isolate was ERBV2, and it was therefore designated ERBV2.1576/99. This is the first reported isolation of ERBV in Australia. The study highlights the utility of PCR for the identification of viruses in clinical samples that may initially be considered negative by conventional cell culture isolation. 138 W. D.

The ERBV1 serotype comprises two distinct phylogenetic groups, one of which is phenotypically acid stable and the other, acid labile [1]. ERBV1 and ERBV2 have been isolated from horses in Switzerland, UK, USA, Canada and Japan over an approximately 30-year period [5, 9, 19, 20, 27]. ERBV1and ERBV2-neutralising antibodies are present in approximately 50-80% of horses in Switzerland, ], and similar rates occur in Australian horses (unpublished). ERBV1 and ERBV2 have been isolated from horses with acute febrile respiratory disease with clinical signs that include fever to 41 \u2022 C for one to three days, serous nasal discharge, anorexia, oedema of the legs, lethargy, and pain and swelling of the lymph nodes of the head and neck. ERBV1 and ERBV2 subclinical infection and subsequent seroconversion were also recognized [2, 26] .",

Samples were then incubated at 50 \u2022 C before the addition of 0.5 \u00b5L of Superscript II-RNAse H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 0.5 \u00b5L RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences), 1 \u00b5L 10 mM dNTP, 2 \u00b5L 100 mM DTT, and 4 \u00b5L 5\u00d7 RT buffer. After incubation at 50 \u2022 C for 45 min, reactions were inactivated at 70 \u2022 C for 5 min and either used undiluted, or diluted 1:10 with water. If stored for later use, samples were heated to 70 \u2022 C and vortexed immediately prior to use. PCR reactions were prepared in 200-\u00b5L PCR tubes (CLP Biological), with 25 \u00b5L final reaction volume with 400 nM of each primer, 10 units Taq polymerase (Promega), Taq buffer, 3.5 mM MgCl 2 , 200 \u00b5M of each dNTP [12] . Primers used in the first round were: 400 nM of primers ERBV.OUTER.f (TTTTGATGCTTCA CATTCTCC) and ERBV.OUTER.r (CGCTGTACCCTCGGTCCTACTC), to which 5 \u00b5L of the undiluted RT mixture was added as template. One drop of mineral oil was added to the reactions. Aerosol-resistant micropipette tips (CLP Biological) were used throughout. PCR cycle conditions were: 1 min at 95 \u2022 C, then 35 cycles of 30 sec at 60 \u2022 C, 45 sec at 72 \u2022 C, and 30 sec at 95 \u2022 C. 2 \u00b5L of the resulting first-round PCR mixture was diluted in 1 mL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and 5 \u00b5L was then added to the second-round PCR reactions as template. Second-round PCR reactions were performed as for the first-round PCR, but using primers ERBV.INNER.f (CTTACTAYGAATGTGARGGGGC) and ERBV.INNER.r (GCCTCGGCGAGTGAAGAG). Cultured ERBV isolates were diluted 1:1000 in transport medium prior to viral RNA extraction to avoid overloading the nested RT-PCR. Amplicons were analysed in 1% agarose gels as previously described [1] . Purification of amplified viral cDNA for sequencing were also as previously described [1] . Typically, for sequencing 1 pmol of primer, 4 \u00b5L of BDT3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and 60-90 ng of template DNA was used per sequencing reaction. Both strands of at least three separate clones were sequenced.",

The amino acid alignment was then used to determine percentage amino acid identities and similarities between each sequence. The deduced amino acid sequences obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab samples were very similar to each other (99.4% amino acid identity; 98.8-100% amino acid similarity), and were very similar to ERBV sequences (96.5-100% amino acid identity; 97.6-100% amino acid similarity).

In the presence of MgCl 2 and ZnCl 2 , the plaques were very large and visible (approximately 250-1000 \u00b5m), but the uninfected cells also had some slight cytopathology presumably due to the toxicity of the solutes. ZnCl 2 was cytotoxic at 2 mM, causing complete destruction of the RK13 cell monolayer. Other solutes such as CuSO 4 , NH 4 SO 4 , MnCl 2 , glutathione and DEAE, were assayed, but were either cytotoxic or had little effect on the virus titre at the concentrations used.

The detection of ERBV in six of 17 swabs tested, and the observation that ERBV1 and ERBV2 were isolated from the saliva of horses at titres from approximately 56-5600 TCID 50 /mL [9] suggests that the ERBV-specific nested RT-PCR is sensitive enough to detect ERBV in clinical samples, assuming that nasal swabs and saliva samples are similar.

Efforts were then made to improve the culture conditions for ERBV in general and for ERBV2.1576/99 in particular. Plaques produced by human rhinoviruses were reported to be larger in the presence of 20 mM MgCl 2 and also when low bicarbonate medium was used [8] , while zinc ions may inhibit the growth and or cytopathogenicity of rhinoviruses [23] . Cardiovirus growth in cell culture is enhanced by 40 mM magnesium ions [25] . Similarly, we found that the plaques formed by ERBV2.1576/99 and ERBV2.313/75 were larger and more visible in L-15 medium supplemented with 20 mM MgCl 2 . The apparent enhancement of ERBV2.1576/99 titre in medium supplemented with 20 mM MgCl 2 was possibly due to the effect on the cells, rather than on the virus per se, given the similarity of effects using ZnCl 2 .

            "text": "The development of an ERBV-specific fully nested RT-PCR allowed the identification and first isolation of ERBV in Australia, demonstrating conclusively that ERBV is present inAustralian horses. The ERBV-specific RT-PCR would facilitate detection of ERBV in nasopharyngeal swab samples by reducing the dependence on cell culture conditions and virus viability in samples. RT-PCR is advantageous because of high sensitivity and specificity, and the short time required to produce a result relative to established techniques such as virus isolation by cell culture, or the observation of seroconversion using paired serum samples and testing by ELISA or SN antibody assay [6, 10] . Seroconversion of convalescent horses to ERBV1 or ERBV2 may not be a reliable means of diagnosis given that approximately 80% of horses sampled had detectable SN antibody to either virus, albeit at low SN antibody titre, and that most seropositive horses had only mild (i.e., <4-fold) subsequent rises in SN antibody titre. ERBV has been isolated from horses without detectable SN antibody, and conversely, some horses were observed to seroconvert without isolation of ERBV [5] , strengthening the need for a fast, reliable and sensitive method of detection, such as RT-PCR, that does not rely on a serum antibody response or virus isolation. The conclusive determination of ERBV as the cause of equine respiratory disease by detection of virus in nasopharyngeal samples by nested RT-PCR is, however, also made difficult by the long-term persistent infection of horses with these viruses without causing apparent disease, as reported after the repeated isolation of ERBV1 over 2 years after two yearling colts were experimentally infected [3] . Conclusive demonstration of the association between ERBV and clinical disease in future studies would be greatly facilitated by the use of the nested RT-PCR described above.",
