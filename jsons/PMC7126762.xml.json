It is well known, when the materials size are brought to nanoscale sizes they suddenly display very different properties compared to their original properties as a bulky material (Vigneshvar et al., 2016). A variety of nanomaterials has been synthesized using different preparation methods (Yang et al., 2015, Sadeghian et al., 2017, Ahmad et al., 2017a, Ahmad et al., 2017b, Ahmad et al., 2017c, Ashley et al., 2017, Luong and Vashist, 2017, Shrestha et al., 2017). Among diverse nanomaterials architectures, NWs are highly functional structures and offer unique properties due to their one dimensionalities. Especially, the electrical conductivity through NWs is greatly affected by the biological/chemical species adsorbed on their surface. Hence, NWs are effectively used to develop nanoscale devices with enhanced sensing performances.",

Bioanalysis in general and biosensor fields in particular are showing special interest in NWs due to rapid response, small size, and high sensitivity and portability. Moreover, newer NWs with particularly impressive, robust and economically feasible platforms may provide high current amplification and sustain an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio among all the detection methodologies owing to their excellent sensitivity, label-free, real-time response for bio- and chemical molecule detection (Turner, 2013, Citartan et al., 2013, Sang et al., 2015). Other nanomaterials (bulk or non-NWs) nanostructures are also used for the fabrication of FET-based sensing devices. However, such devices made of bulk or non-NWs materials offer poor sensitivity due to the high dimensionality and lower surface-to-volume ratio.",

Recently, FET-based biosensing devices were reported with high sensitivity and easy fabrication process, compared to other biosensing devices (Chen et al., 2011b, Rubtsova et al., 2017, Arya et al., 2015, Huang et al., 2015, Zheng et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2016, Piccinini et al., 2017, Jin et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2015b, Tran et al., 2016, Mao et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2016, Minami et al., 2016, Tan et al., 2015, Park et al., 2016, Puchnin et al., 2017). Additionally, FET-based biosensing devices have the advantage of low-weight, low-cost of mass production, small size and compatible with commercial planar processes for large-scale circuitry. During biological fragments analysis, these biosensing devices directly concert the biological actions into electronic signals, which can be the shortest route of detection. Therefore, development of new nanostructured materials for FET-based biosensor fabrication drew more attentions. In this context, this review summarizes the recent advances of NWs-based FET biosensors for different biomolecule detection. Utilization of various materials NW, comparative sensing performance, limitations, present challenges, and future prospects of NWs-based FET biosensors are also discussed.",

            "text": "Since the development of first FET in 1970, there has been the major drive to utilize FET-based biosensor devices for different analytes detection (Bergveld, 1970, Balasubramanian, 2010, Cella et al., 2010, Artiles et al., 2011). In these biosensors, current flows along a semiconductor path (the channel) that is connected to two electrodes, S-D. When charged molecules exist on the surface of the FET biosensors, the channel conductance between S-D can be controlled by a third (gate) electrode that is capacitively coupled through a thin dielectric layer (Liu and Guo, 2012, Shoorideh and Chui, 2014). In such devices for insulation, an oxide is used as a gate dielectric, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) (\nScheme 1a). It also contains a p-type silicon substrate (bulk). Where the negative gate potential leads to the accumulation of holes (majority charge carriers), resulting in an increase of the channel conductance, while the positive gate potential leads to the depletion of holes and hence decrease the conductance. The adsorption of molecules on the surface of the semiconducting channel either changes its local surface potential or directly dopes the channel, resulting in the change of FET conductance. This makes the FET a promising sensing device with easily adaptable configuration, enhanced sensitivity and real-time capability. Additionally, the nonspecific absorption problem is solved using smart chemistry to prevent the fouling of the surface when device is exposed to complex media i.e. human serum/blood (Cheran et al., 2014).",

From the scheme, the semiconducting NWs channels are immersed in a flow or sensing chamber, which is used to confine the solution. In such FET biosensors, the source and electrodes are insulated to prevent current leakage from ionic conduction using insulators i.e. poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(dimethylsiloxane)/silicone rubber, SiO2 thin film, SU8 passivation, and silicone rubber (Yang and Zhang, 2014, Huang et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2011a, Kergoat et al., 2012, Chen et al., 2013, Feigel et al., 2011, Sudibya et al., 2011). The gate electrode (Ag/AgCl or Pt) is immersed in the solution. Due to the small size of devices, use of a conventional reference electrode limits seriously. Therefore, the development of a miniature reference electrode is necessary. At the channel/solution interface, the gate potential is applied through thin electric double layer capacitance. The sensing performance of FET biosensors depends on the variety and thickness of the gate insulators. The ionic strength of solution determines the double-layer thickness (or Debye length), which is typically within 1 nm. Maehashi et al. (2013) have demonstrated a graphene-based FET for the detection of K/Na ions in solution. In this report, the solution-gated FET was over two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the typical back-gate FET.",

Recently, ZnO NWs-based FET biosensors for glucose detection were reported with enhanced sensing performances. Importantly, in an aqueous environment the fabricated glucose sensing device sensed glucose in the concentration range of 0.1\u2013100 mM with high sensitivity, which matches the physiological concentration of glucose (1\u201320 mM) in humans (Heller and Feldman, 2008). Yu et al. (2013) demonstrated the fabrication of a self-powered, piezotronic effect enhanced glucose sensor based on metal-semiconductor-metal structured single ZnO NW device. The results showed that piezotronic effect significantly raises the sensitivity as well as improve the sensing resolution of ZnO NW-based glucose sensors and provides a possible way to build up a self-powered glucose monitoring system.",

They functionalized the back channel of IGZO-FETs with aminosilane groups that were cross-linked to GOx and have demonstrated that these devices have high sensitivity to changes in glucose concentrations. Glucose sensing occurs through the decrease in pH during glucose oxidation, which modulates the positive charge of the aminosilane groups attached to the IGZO surface (d). The change in charge affects the number of acceptor-like surface states, which can deplete electron density in the n-type IGZO semiconductor. Increasing glucose concentrations leads to an increase in acceptor states and a decrease in S-D conductance due to a positive shift in the turn-on voltage. This study advances the development of oxide-based FETs for applications to glucose biosensors with the potential to integrate fully transparent sensors into contact lenses.",

The cross-linking method was used to immobilize uricase on ZnO NWs and device characteristics were measured, which showed high on/off ratio and very low transconductance of ~4.6 \u00d7106 and ~8.2 nS, respectively. While increasing uric acid concentration, a rapid increase in device conductance was recorded at room temperature in an ambient environment. The response time turned out to be in the order of a millisecond, which is relatively short compared to other diagnostic technologies. Also, the sensor was more sensitive at low uric acid concentrations than at high concentrations. High selectivity, low detection limit, and cost-effective approach of the device can be further exploited by expanding into arrays for portable, reliable and real-time detection of analytes.",

To protect NWs from the harsh environment and enhance electrical conductance, some groups have used effective surface modification platforms (Keem et al., 2007, Ra et al., 2012). Also, the charge transport in single NW strongly depends on its surface environmental conditions and can be explained by the formation of depletion layer at the surface by various surface states present on it. As known, that the ZnO NWs contains a lot of surface oxygen sites due to the very large surface-to-volume ratio. According to this phenomenon, the surface electron depletes from the surface of the ZnO NW and hence decreases the channel conductivity. Verma et al. (2008) reported an ultraviolet irradiation treatment method at high temperature and vacuum. Where ultraviolet light stimulated oxygen desorption from the active channel and improves the device performance (~17 times) of ZnO NW-FETs. The nondestructive surface cleaning removes these absorbed surface states from the NW and the current values increase up to ~7 \u03bcA from ~0.4 \u03bcA at a bias voltage of 3 V. Recently, Choi et al. (2010) also used physical method to change the conductance of ZnO NWs surface through modification that also enhances the enzyme immobilization efficiency. The fabricated FET-based biosensor-utilizing surface modified ZnO NWs were further characterized for streptavidin detection. The ZnO NW biosensors easily detect streptavidin binding down to a concentration of 2.5 nM in an enhancement mode with a higher sensitivity compared to other NW-based biosensors.",

(2012) demonstrated a robust and multifunctional nanosheath based on nonthermal plasma technology, which can overcome the problem of the chemical instability of the core ZnO NWs in a solution environment and make it possible for them to serve as pH sensors and biosensors. A polymer-like amorphous carbon (PAC) was deposited on ZnO NWs during nonthermal plasma technology-based chemical modifications on the surface, which were subsequently used for amino group's formation for the effective immobilization of biomolecules. The additional advantage of this approach allows controlling the thickness of the PAC shell on the ZnO NWs without any significant changes in the electrical properties of the ZnO NWs (Ra et al., 2009). Further, the potential biosensor applications showed that the amino functionalized ZnO/PAC NW FETs can be directly employed for the real-time, label-free detection of anti-\u03b1-feptoprotein (AFP). The anti-AFP modified NW FET was successfully applied to the real-time, label-free detection of cancer biomarkers in human serum of a liver carcinoma patient. In particular, this study can be directly extended to high-performance biosensor applications with higher sensitivity and selectivity, since the PAC shell can be easily functionalized for the purpose of covalent binding and steric stabilization.",

These properties greatly enhance the sensing abilities i.e. selectivity and sensitivity, real-time response, and label-free detection capabilities; especially the detection limit can be measured up to femtomolar (fM) concentrations with high sensitivity. Additionally, the small dimension (~1\u2013100 nm) makes them more comparable and compatible to the dimensional scale of biological and chemical species (Nair and Alam, 2007). In FET-based devices, SiNWs with the smallest dimension resulted in fast electron transfer due to direct charge accumulation in NWs that leads to ultrasensitive and selective detection of various analytes.",

With these improved devices, selective detection of insulin-analog in both buffer and diluted human serum with LOD down to 10 fM was achieved repeatedly. In another report, Puppo et al.

As a consequence of the field-effect-based sensing mechanism, the distance of the DNA (charge layer) to the SiNW surface plays a key role in the detection sensitivity.

The electronic measurements showed that a single-stranded complementary oligonucleotide significantly changed the conductance of a group of 20-nm-diameter SiNWs in 0.165 M solution by hybridizing to a primary DNA strand that has been electrostatically adsorbed onto an amine-terminated organic monolayer atop the NWs. This intimate contact of the primary strand with the amine groups of the NW surface brings the binding event close enough to the NW to be electronically detected. In addition, within a 0.165 M ionic strength solution the DNA hybridization was more efficient. Li et al. (2004) reported SiNWs-based highly sensitive and sequence-specific DNA FET device with ss-probe DNA molecules covalently immobilized on the NW surface. Label-free complementary (target) ss-DNA in sample solutions was recognized when the target DNA was hybridized with the probe DNA attached on the SiNW surfaces, producing a change in the conductance of the SiNWs. For a 12-mer oligonucleotide probe, 25 pM of target DNA in solution was detected easily (signal/noise ratio >6), whereas 12-mers with one base mismatch didnot produce a signal above the background noise.

Many groups demonstrated the use of AlGaN/GaN heterojunction FETs to detect biological target molecules such as DNAs and proteins with low concentrations (Jin et al., 2013, Lee et al., 2015a, Wen et al., 2011, Li et al., 2014).

Williams et al. (2014) demonstrated a solution based functionalization method for the specific and selective attachment of streptavidin protein to GaN NWs. They performed all functionalization steps in solution, which enabled the assembly of multiple protein-specific NWs on a single biosensing platform. Streptavidin was immobilized on the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) functionalized NWs. Such biotinylated GaN NW surface was highly specific towards the binding of streptavidin and demonstrated no affinity towards a control protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). However, there was evidence of non-specific, electrostatic binding of both the streptavidin protein and the BSA protein to the APTES-coated NWs, revealing the importance of the biotinylation step. This study presented GaN NWs as a suitable material for protein sensing and for biosensing applications.",

(2011) reported In2O3 NW FET-based label-free biosensing system that rapidly detected cancer biomarkers directly from human whole blood collected by a finger prick. As shown in the\nFig. 6a, first, they collected blood through finger prick device, allowed to clot, and passed through the microfilter to remove blood cells. Fig. 6b shows the microscopic and optical images of a blood sample before and after filtration. The blood cells were almost completely filtered (99.6%), which was delivered to the nanosensor for electrical measurements (Fig. 6c). These nanosensors with In2O3 NWs were coated with the CA-125 antibody (\nFig. 7a). The real-time response for CA-125 antibody coated device showed the decrease in S-D current and re-equilibrated to a lower level after being introduced to 1 U/mL CA-125 with the change in current about 1%. However, when the device was first submerged in serum and then exposed to CA-125 of 1 U/mL concentration, there was no noticeable sensing signal during real-time sensing response (Fig. 7b). Hence, the loss of sensing response in serum was due to the presence of nontargeted proteins in the serum that negatively impacts the sensitivity of nanosensors. Further, to overcome the limitation induced by nonspecific binding of nontargeted proteins, they utilized an amphipathic polymer, Tween 20, to passivated the NW surface that reduces nonspecific binding (Fig. 7c). The passivated device almost showed a similar response to the device in purified buffer (Fig. 7a), which clearly confirm that the Tween 20 passivation of NW surface protects the nonspecific binding of nontargeted proteins and retain the excellent sensing performance of fabricated devices even in the complex medium such as serum. Finally, devices were used to detect two epithelial ovarian cancer biomarkers, CA-125 and insulin-like growth factor II in real time. They got a 0.1 U/mL detection limit for CA-125 and an 8 ng/mL detection limit, which was at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than the clinically relevant level for diagnosis in both cases.",

AMPs are the polypeptides, which bind to their target analytes with high affinity and specificity, just like conventional antibodies, but are much smaller in size (2\u20135 nm, less than 10 kDa). They utilized In2O3 NWs to fabricate FET-based sensor after modifying with an AMP as a biomarker (Fibronectin, Fn), to detect a nucleocapsid protein biomarker associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. BSA was used as passivation to get rid of nonspecific binding interactions of proteins with the NW device and probably false positive results (inset of\nFig. 8c). Fig. 8a and b show the change of normalized current when adding BSA. After several times of BSA addition, the current stabilizes as a baseline and are suitable for the detection of N protein. The current response with the addition of different concentration of N protein is demonstrated in Fig. 8c. A higher concentration leads to a larger normalized current response. When Fn was removed, no significant response can be observed, confirming that the Fn-based capture probe can selectively capture the N protein. In another work, Ishikawa et al. (2009b) reported that the electrostatic interaction is the dominant sensing mechanism for In2O3 NW-based FET biosensors, and studied the correlation between the gate dependence and the absolute responses of biosensors measured by means of a liquid gated electrode. They developed a data analysis method to calibrate the sensor performance by dividing the absolute response by the gate dependence of each device and successfully reduced the device-to-device variation according to the correlation.",

The resistance could be switched by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude by repeatedly cycling with water and 0.1 M HCl. A similar but lower resistance change was observed for PPy.

Biotin conjugated to a 20-mer DNA oligo (biotin-DNA) was applied for sensor fabrication. The resistance of avidin-functionalized NWs was increased rapidly to a constant value upon addition of 1 nM of the biotin-DNA conjugate, and the resistance change increased with increasing concentrations up to 100 nM.

Especially for the NWs-based biosensors fabrication, NWs not only improved the performance of biosensors but also reduced the size of the device, which enables detection of clinically important biomolecules in laboratories or at home. Furthermore, the combination/modification of different NWs with metal/metal oxide to increase even more the performances of biosensors is a well-accepted strategy. A vast number of different NWs-based biosensors all with its own specific properties have been recently published emphasizing the principal advantages of such NWs usages. However, the advantages of those novel biomolecular detection platforms over conventional bioassay tools remain to be clarified. Despite achieving high detection sensitivities by NWs-based biosensors, their reliability and reproducibility may need careful examinations.

The development of a reliable and scalable fabrication method is needed for the mass-production of identical NWs. Also, the integration of NWs into functional devices with high yields is another important issue. The fully integration of separation and purification processes are used to control NWs properties during device fabrication. Recently, solvent-based reproducible and controllable positioning, placement and orientation of NWs on the desired substrate locations are effectively utilized. From the application point of view, the development of a simple and reliable reference electrode integration method and diagnosis under physiological conditions may lead to a new generation of devices. Additionally, fouling during bioanalytical applications in a real sample is another problem, which greatly reduces the sensitivity of the device during detection of specific targets. To overcome this issue, antifouling surface coatings are mainly used to reduce/minimize nonspecific interactions. Moreover, introduction of microfluidics to the devices for designing lab-on-a-chip based nanosensor devices will strongly benefit the miniaturization, nano-fabrication, and combining the stereo specificity of biological macromolecules, to get the desired result of ultra-sensitive micro sized diagnostics, within the reach of patient, physician, emergency room, hospital use in static and dynamic continuous monitoring mode.",
