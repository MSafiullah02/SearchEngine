Some point to these events as illustration of the weakness of the global health security narrative (Youde 2014) . In particular, it has been noted that the Ebola outbreak in 2014 was initially met with no international capacity outside of the World Health Organization (WHO) to respond to this crisis. The creation of the UN Mission on Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September (2014) was the first, and some argue should be the last, effort to respond to a viral outbreak (Panel of independent experts 2015). Others contend that, given that there is no procedure under the UN Charter for the General Assembly or Security Council to examine health matterslet alone develop a mission like UNMEERbroader UN engagement in health beyond the WHO could point to the success of the global health diplomacy (McInnes 2015) . The question is what does successful global health diplomacy look like? Do we see in practice the securitisation of health as essential to pursue international diplomatic engagement in global health?",

            "text": "There have been recent claims that the successful international engagement in health initiatives such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global Fund) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have been achieved without asserting their necessity 'primarily on security considerations ' (McInnes and Rushton 2013: 16 ; see also Sridhar 2012; Gagnon and Labonte 2011) . However, the assumption remains that linking health issues, specifically health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks to security discourse will create more opportunities for diplomatic cooperation and engagement (see Feldbaum et al. 2010; Hafner and Shiffman 2013) . This chapter explores this argument beginning with the period where the phrase 'global health diplomacy' and 'global health governance' began to gain usage in international relations in the 1990s. In the first part of the chapter I briefly present the conceptual history of health security and its relationship to 'global health diplomacy'. I explore the argument that the success of global health diplomacy has come from the preponderant use of security language, referents, and discourse (cf. Elbe 2011; Feldbaum et al. 2010; Kickbusch et al. 2007; McInnes and Rushton 2013) . In the second part of the chapter I examine two cases, one where a type of security logic was deliberately employed to frame the 'health emergency' (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control or FCTC) and one where human rights logic was initially deployed when advocating for its creation (the Global Alliance for Vaccine Immunization or GAVI). I evaluate what 'health security' looks like in these global health initiatives and explore the presumption that 'security discourse' must be present in comparing these two major, successful global health initiatives.",

Likewise, the post-Second World War Bretton Woods system had a profound influence upon health-care policy and practice around the world, with key lending institutions like the World Bank promoting particular health-care systems and policies in their lending programmes (Sridhar 2012) . In this period, key discourses such as 'Health for All', the Essential Medicines List, and Right to Health emerged in the absence of linkage to security. These discourses brought in a range of actors including international organisations, NGOs and transnational corporations with the power to shape health opportunities and outcomes within and amongst states (Gagnon and Labont\u00e9 2011) . In the 1990s, however, foreign and defence ministries became increasingly interested in global health policyparticularly infectious diseaseswhich would be referred to as having a 'securitising' effect on health (McInnes and Lee 2006) .",

Acute awareness was growing amongst Western states that they were not immune to health events such as infectious disease outbreaks. The outbreak and spread of HIV across developing and developed countries during the 1980s; fear of biosecurity attacks with the breakdown of security in laboratories across the former Soviet Union (Koblentz 2010) ; sudden outbreak of the plague in India in 1995 and the arrival of West Nile virus near New York City in 1999; and the return of 'slow-burn' diseases thought eradicated such as Tuberculosis (TB), measles and meningitis in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia (Price-Smith 2002).

Clinton's move created a wave of interest in other developed countries, particularly the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, all shifting to appreciate and contextualise health threats in foreign policy terms (McInnes and Lee 2012: 32). Until then, on the rare occasion that health policy was discussed at the international level it was in relation to (mostly) infectious disease outbreaks such as plague and cholera, or large-scale efforts such as the mass immunisation programme led by WHO to eradicate smallpox. During infectious disease outbreaks, emphasis had been squarely placed on the responsibility of the host state and regardless of the capacity of its public health system to effectively respond (Fidler 1999) .",

At the same time, David Fidler and Andrew Price-Smith called for equal attention to the economic, political, and social insecurity that stems from a range of infectious diseases already prevalent in countries (Fidler 2003; Price-Smith 2002) . Using quantitative analysis of the relationship between infectious diseases and state capacity, Price-Smith claimed that 'infectious disease [already] constitutes a verifiable threat to national security and state power' (Price-Smith 2002: 19) . Health security, Price-Smith (2002: 9) argued, referred to the threat of the disease on particular populations as well as the country's economic and political stability becoming unsustainable as a result of a pathogen wiping out the core population base.

As state capacity declines and as pathogen-induced deprivation and increasing demands upon the state increase, we may see an attendant increase in the incidence of chronic sub-state violence and state failure. State failure frequently produces chaos in affected regions as neighbouring states seal their borders to prevent the massive influx of disease-infected refugee populations. Adjacent states may also seek to fill the power vacuum and may seize valued territory from the collapsing state, prompting other proximate states to do the same and so exacerbating regional security dilemmas. (Price-Smith 2002: 15) In a similar vein, David Fidler's seminal 1999 book International Law and Infectious Diseases argued that with the increased risk of drug-resistant microbes in the twenty first century, as identified by public health officials (Institute of Medicine 1992; Heymann 1996), it will become important to 'understand the international politics of infectious disease control, or microbialpolitik' (Fidler 1999: 19) . Microbialpolitik, argued Fidler, was 'wrapped up not only in traditional concerns such as sovereignty and power but also in the implementation of scientifically sound infectious disease policies at the national and international levels' (ibid.).",

Jeremy Shiffman's (2006: 411-420 ) work on the peaks and troughs of investment in global health initiatives has revealed that despite disease burden to a population, some infectious diseases (i.e. HIV/AIDS) consistently attract stronger short-term investment from donor statesprimarily those that are contagious or linked to the national security interests of donor states. However, it would be a mistake to assume that the threat of infectious disease alone encapsulated all diplomatic engagement with health issues at the turn of the twenty-first century.",

If insecurity and grievances amongst the population played a large part in the civil wars that gripped the 1990s (Fearon and Laitin 2003) , engagement with health is not just a security concern for developed states but also for developing states. In other words, appreciations of health security were not one-dimensional. It was possible to advocate for a vision of health security that sought to protect individuals as much states. Indeed, a human centred appreciation of securitycoined 'human security' by the 1994 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report (see MacFarlane and Khong 2006)sought to redefine the 'traditional' security with issues and concepts under the umbrella term 'non-traditional' security, including health (Chalk 2006) .",

In the last decade, events such as the United Nations Security Resolution on HIV/AIDS (S/Res/1308) and SARS create an explosion of IR engagement with global health governance, particularly in the area of health security. This 'phenomenon' has been witnessed again with the Ebola outbreak (Youde 2014) . Amongst all these engagements, two key approaches have emerged. First, those who accept the inevitability of a 'narrow' approach to health and IR, focused on infectious diseases and bioterrorism as security threats (Koblentz 2012) . Alternatively, there are those who articulate a broader vision related to development, state capacity, and cross-national health issues (Shiffman 2006; Nunes 2014; Rushton and Williams 2012) . One of the central claims of the former approach is that health securitisation is an effective way of galvanising diplomatic engagement amongst states and other actors, resulting in the allocation of political will and material resources (Collier and Lakoff 2008; Elbe 2011; Hafner and Shiffman 2013) .",

Interest in these two cases comes from exploring the above presumption that security and health, particularly concerning infectious diseases, drives, and delivers policy momentum. While there is debate about whether that momentum translates into 'real' policy progress or whether it is mere rhetoric deployed at particular crises/events with no lasting impact, there is no debate that health security has dominated global health and foreign policy discourse (Feldbaum et al. 2010; McInnes and Rushton 2013) . Below, I briefly examine the dominance of health security in successful global health initiativesone where you would expect it to be deliberately deployed (GAVI) and one where it was not (TFI). TFI and GAVI, I contend, are interesting cases precisely because they confound the issueframing conventions about the relationship between health and security.",

The TFI sought to reach an international agreement under international law that countries would adopt to regulate the sale and production of tobacco. This global health initiative was in aid of preventing the unchecked rise of tobacco related illnessesnon-communicable diseasesincluding cancer (various), emphysema, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes (to name a few). In the case of the TFI, and in light of the literature discussion concerning health security above, it would be expected that there was little to no presence of security discourse in the early days of this initiative. It was (and is) about introducing tobacco control legislation, addressing unregulated sale and distribution of tobacco to address preventable tobacco-related diseases in young populations in already over-burdened public health-care systems (Roemer et al. 2005) . In contrast, the GAVI is a public and private partnership between states, international organisations, pharmaceutical companies, and philanthropic donors that sought cooperation amongst this diverse group of actors to manufacture, purchase and deliver life-saving vaccines against deadly infectious diseases in the most remote, dangerous and impoverished locations around the world. GAVI is, ostensibly, the initiative where it would be expected to see initial employment of 'security' rhetoric given it is addressing the health insecurity of under five children in need of vaccination from, mostly, contagious infectious diseases. In fact, the immediate previous iteration of GAVIthe Child Vaccination Initiativeused security type discourse such as 'mission', 'operation', and 'threat'' under the steerage of a former US defence army medic (see Muraskin 2002) .",

The main difference, of interest to this chapter, is that the association of security with the health issue confound the type of cases analysed to date in the IR literature on global health security.

To facilitate answering these three levels of inquiry, three query searches within NVivo of each document were conducted: (1) word frequency analysis, (2) text search of 'security' terms and, and (3) text search of 'other' normative terms (development, rights, economy). A word tree was then developed for the second and third text searches with a 'in context' search up to ten surrounding words (on either side) to enable understanding of the context and usage of the key words, i.e. 'threat' or 'poor' being searched in the document. The word frequency search assisted with identifying the primary actors discussed in the documentsi.e. who was identified as the referent actor intended for that initiative versus the functional actor necessary to give effect to the initiative.",

In both cases, the presence of security language was less than 1% of each document. What was significant was that in the search for 'other' normative terms (terms: responsible, rights, develop, needs, poor)the Framework Convention was comparatively high at 1.05%, and a similar search for GAVI came at 0.4% references. However, given the Framework Convention is a legal document the presence of 'right/rights' partly accounts for high percentage compared to GAVI. Contextual analysis of these terms reveals further detail in how the documents framed the problem, the referent actor and the functional actor (see Table 14 .1).",

The Convention directly refers to populations at risk (women and minors) and the need for member states to support civil society capacity to inform and educate tobacco awareness in these populations. Again, this is a legal instrument so the emphasis on member states is not surprising as they are the only signatories. However, even in 'other normative' references to rights, responsibilities and needprimary emphasis remains on the state as the functional actor protects the population at risk of addiction rather than alternative dominant frames such as the right to health, the right to information. The Framework Convention leans towards more 'traditional' security language in conceptualising the In the case of GAVI, the 0.07% security references in contrast with its 0.4% 'other' references hints at a different frame being brought to this initiative. However, it is not particularly clear until, again, the broader context of these terms is analysed. In the case of GAVI the focus is overwhelming on the 'mission' of the alliance and ensuring institutional clarity to support the primary focusthe right of the child to immunisation. This is clearly stated as seen above, particularly in the mission and responsibility statements (Table 14 .1). The only time the roles of functional actors are associated with either security or other terms are in the context of securing commitment from actors (broad range of board membership from states to international organisations, pharmaceutical companies, and civil society), and development of health sector capacity.",

Others contend it is a 'smokescreen' that captures short bursts of attention that are episodic and may have immediate impact but no essential 'follow through ' (McInnes and Rushton 2013) .

In examining the cases of TFI and GAVI, I looked at their core document: their mission and value statements reflected in, respectively, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the first meeting documents of GAVI.

In the case of the Framework Convention where a focus on security was expected and to a greater extent seen here was an equally strong presence of human rights and 'sovereignty as responsibility' language. The security discourse may have helped capture attention but it was not the only discursive tool at play and neither did it obviously displace other discourses. In the case of GAVI, the initiative identified its primary mission as fulfilling the rights of the child; whereas for TFI, emphasis was member states fulfilling their responsibility to address the threat of tobacco related illness from tobacco usage. GAVI appears to have a single referentthe right of the child to health via immunisation; while TFI related to a multitude of actors. The operationalisation of the initiative(s) and their embeddedness in global health architecture dominated the discussion far more than the framing language. Framing language constituted a relatively small part of the discourse compared to the consuming discussion of institutional design. What this comparison of two global health initiatives reveals is that whilst security discourse might help capture the attention of states, it has not necessarily overtaken other policy frames such as human rights and 'sovereignty as responsibility language'. Indeed, the key priority seems to be not whether the international community should be engaged with these issues, but the appropriate institutional design for initiatives to achieve these health goals.",
