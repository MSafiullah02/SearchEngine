Measurements and Main Results: Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scanning. Conclusions: The present study indicates that COVID 19\u00c0specific guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room. Most patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography scans. \u00d3 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Isolation of a novel coronavirus (CoV) responsible for the COVID 19 outbreak-a novel beta-coronavirus-in patients from Wuhan subsequently was completed by Chinese scientists, and it was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 4 As of March 8, 2020, a total of 80,735 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections had been reported in China, with 3,119 deaths and 5,111 of the cases being classified as severe. 5 By January 2, 2020, Huang et al. 2 had reported clinical features of the first 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infections in Wuhan. Clinical manifestations are very similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, including dyspnea, which developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients. Furthermore, patients with severe 2019-nCoV developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required intensive care unit admission, oxygen therapy, and endotracheal intubation.",

The patient with the first documented case in the United States presented with pneumonia and showed nonspecific signs and symptoms of mild illness, and this type of presentation undoubtedly increases the difficulty of early protective preparation for operating room personnel.

Anesthesiologists in Wuhan have made great efforts to control this epidemic (Fig 3) . As previously mentioned, anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted by an expert panel from the Department of Anesthesiology at Wuhan Union Hospital (Fig 4) ; these procedures are detailed in the Supplementary Material as follows: (1) anesthesiologists' procedures for emergency intubation of patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV infection, (2) precautions for 2019-nCoV infection in outpatient evaluation center, and (3) precautions for 2019-nCoV infection control in the operating rooms. After adopting the aforementioned procedures, the 4 hospitals in the study completed 321 cases of emergency surgical anesthesia, including for 37 patients who were laboratory-confirmed as having or were suspected of having 2019-nCoV.

In operating rooms in which infection control procedures are rigorously applied, the risk for staff to contract 2019-nCoV from patient contact is low, despite long exposure times. In addition, for the present study, the anesthesia-related characteristics of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 in the 4 most affected hospitals in Wuhan, China, were examined. On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and subsequently named COVID-19 (also named as 2019nCoV earlier) by the World Health Organization. 4, 5 Coronaviruses, such as SARS 11, 12 and Middle East respiratory syndrome, 13, 14 mainly cause respiratory tract infections in humans. In the present study, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, and bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest CT scans. These data are consistent with recent reports. 2, 6, 9 Transmission rates are unknown for 2019-nCoV; however, there is strong evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission. 6, 7, 9 The number of infections is increasing quickly. By January 30, 2020, 9,692 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections had been reported in China, with 213 fatal cases. 5 In particular, at the same time, 15 health care workers had been reported to be infected by 2019-nCoV, 14 of whom were assumed to have been infected by caring for 2019-nCoV patients. The overall infection rate of health care workers at the time of the present study was unknown. However, precautions and related management procedures need to be implemented immediately to prevent any additional infections. This has challenged health care workers to use effective infection control procedures and measures. Anesthesiologists, as specialists in airway management, generally perform endotracheal intubation in severe cases of hypoxia and provide emergency anesthesia for surgery in these cases. This undoubtedly increases the exposure risk for anesthesiologists because of the frequent exposure to patients' respiratory secretions and blood. Therefore, 2019-nCoV\u00c0specific anesthesia guidelines need to be developed and used to prevent nosocomial spread of the virus.",

Therefore, all anesthesiologists who may be in contact with patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV must take level 3 protective measures, which are detailed in the Supplementary Materials. The World Health Organization also has released important information that has prompted health care workers caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV to reexamine the precautionary procedures of infection control. 4 Furthermore, diagnosis before the patient enters the operating room is important in the effort to prevent cross-infection. Body temperature, laboratory findings (especially lymphocyte count), and chest x-ray and CT findings (especially multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity) should be confirmed before a patient enters the operating room. If the patient has a fever of unknown cause, the examination results show pulmonary infection or low oxygen saturation of unknown cause (< 90%), and the surgery is not an emergency case, anesthesiologists should communicate to the patient, family, and the surgeon that the surgery should be suspended. Meanwhile, during emergency surgical cases, close attention should be paid to the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, especially during anesthesia induction and the procedure.",
