Intracranial infection of Balb/c mice at postnatal day 5 induced a lethal encephalitis in all animals. Of Wistar rats infected at day 2 or 5 after birth, 30 to 70%, respectively, survived. The distribution of viral antigen was studied in frozen brain sections of animals that died after infection; astrocytes were found to be the major virus-infected cell type throughout the central nervous system. More than 75% of the surviving rat pups developed paralysis, but viral antigen was detected in only few brain cells and not in astrocytes. The cell tropism of MHV-JHM was examined further in virus-infected glial cell cultures derived from brains of rats or mice. In the glial cultures derived from Wistar rats, only oligodendrocytes were infected, whereas in cultures derived from mouse or Lewis rat brain viral antigen was detected in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Infection of astrocytes led to the formation of syncytia and degradation of the cytoskeleton. Infected rat oligodendrocytes gradually disappeared from the cultures because of cell death. These phenomena indicate that, besides a n indirect autoimmune response triggered by infected astrocytes, direct virus-induced injury t o astrocytes or to oligodendrocytes can have a dominant role in the neuropathogenicity of mouse hepatitis virus.

An answer might be that the susceptibility to infection with MHV of the various CNS cell types is species dependent. The present experiments support this hypothesis and agree with previous observations made in situ (Powell and Lampert, 1975; Nagashima et al., 1978; Sorensen et al., 1980) and in vitro (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Beushausen and Dales, 1985; Wilson et al., 1986) . When MHV-JHM infection caused an acute encephalitis in young rat pups, antigen could be found throughout the brain, mainly in astrocytes (Fig. 1A,B) . However, when chronic paralysis followed infection, unidentified cells were found to be positive for the viral antigen. These results suggest that a susceptibility of immature brain cells to infection by MHV-JHM may result in a n acute disease in young rat pups. Acute encephalitis in mice, after infection with MHV- Number of virus-uositive cellsb JHM, is always associated with infection of astrocytes (Wilson et al., 1986) . This susceptibility to MHV-JHM infection is found also in cultures of mouse astrocytes and Lewis rats (Massa et al., 1986) . Astrocytes from Wistar rats are not susceptible to MHV-JHM infection, suggesting that they lack distinct binding sites for MHV-JHM. In this context, it is noteworthy that Boyle et al. (1987) reported that target cells from susceptible animals have a MHV-binding molecule on their membranes.

Beushausen and Dales (1985) showed that MHV-JHM replication in oligodendrocytes, derived from newborn Wistar-Furth rats, is maximal between 10 and 15 days after explantation. Replication is suppressed between day 15 and 21, which fits with the report of the same group (Sorensen et al., 1980) that their rats became highly resistant to MHV-JHM infection 3 weeks after birth. It appears, therefore, that MHV-JHM can induce paralysis in Wistar rats only during a short time span of the differentiation phase of oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes (Walker et al., 1984) and astrocytes (Schachner, 1982) in culture develop according to a fixed time schedule.

Such infections could initiate processes having indirect long-term effects on oligodendrocytes and myelin.
