Mean-field models are a special case in which this function is a constant [5] . In this work, we consider a different model in which the agents are mobile and can only infect each other if they are in sufficiently close proximity. The model is motivated both by certain kinds of biological epidemics, whose transmission may be dominated by sites at which individuals gather in close proximity (e.g. workplaces or public transport for a disease like SARS, cattle markets for foot-and-mouth disease, etc.) and by malware spreading between wireless devices via Bluetooth connections, for example.",

In [10] , the authors derive a threshold for the persistence of the epidemic by computing the average number of neighbours of a given node. Using a similar approach but with different mobility patterns, Nekovee et al. [11, 13] explore the evolution of the number of devices that are infected in terms of the contact rate between users. A related line of work studying the dissemination of information in opportunistic networks [3] focuses on the following analogous problem: Suppose that all individuals are interested in a piece of information that is initially held by one user. The information is transmitted between users who happen to be close to each other. As in the case of static networks [12] , one may be interested in the time it takes for the rumour to be known to all users. To this end we need to understand how information is transmitted between an informed and an ignorant user. Our work gives some insight on the impact of the network structure on the likelihood of successfully transmitting the rumour.",

In this framework we were interested in the setting where there are two individuals one infected and one healthy both performing random walks on the network. Our preliminary investigation highlights the effect of the topology on the spread of an epidemic, motivated by networking phenomena such as worms and viruses, failures, and dissemination of information. Under this natural model, we provided an explicit relationship between the structure over which the walks are performed and the coincidence time of the two walkers. To this end we analysed both homogeneous (regular, complete and Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graphs) and heterogeneous (power-law graphs) networks. We pinpointed the existence of a phase transition for the coincidence time in the case of power-law networks depending on the parameter of the power-law degree distribution. We also derived bounds on the probability of infection.",

In our present model individuals are supposed to start their walks in stationary regime. This can be relaxed since the networks we study are expanders and thus random walks on such networks have nice mixing properties as illustrated in [9] through the computation of the isoperimetric constant of the underlying graphs. We also anticipate that similar results can be derived when considering k walkers as long as k is small with respect to n the number of sites in the network.",
