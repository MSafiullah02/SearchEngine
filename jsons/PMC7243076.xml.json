This conceptualization of tolerance was also proposed and discussed in social psychology (Verkuyten & Yogeeswaran, 2017). Allport (1954) once wrote, \u201cWhen we say that we tolerate a headache, or our shabby apartment, or a neighbor, we certainly do not mean that we like them, but merely that in spite of our dislike we shall endure them\u201d (p. 425).",

It presupposes a negative attitude together with refraining from acting on this attitude when one has or believes to have the power to interfere (e.g., constrain, prohibit, persecute): not out of indifference, fear, or threat but because there are additional reasons (e.g., civil liberties, equal rights) for enduring such beliefs, practices, or way of life (Cohen, 2004). Tolerance shares with discrimination a negative attitude, but prevents this attitude from becoming negative actions, and therefore acts as a barrier against discrimination. It is this type of forbearance that some people described when they speak of the capacity of mere tolerance to wound and to be tolerated as an emotionally uncomfortable and hurtful experience (Schirmer et al., 2012). The experience of being tolerated can be examined through the lens of ethnic, cultural, sexual, religious, or ideological out-groups who find that their beliefs or practices are disapproved of and yet endured by others within the social context.",

With toleration, the objection toward minority beliefs and practices is implicitly affirmed, and the implied deviance can threaten a valued minority group membership for the target of tolerance. There is clear empirical evidence that identity devaluation and identity threat have negative psychological consequences (Major, Mendes, & Dovidio, 2013; Major & O\u2019Brien, 2005; Meyer, 2003), but this evidence has not yet been examined in relation to being tolerated.",

Yet, whereas groups can accept that they are perhaps less competent or less sociable when differentiating between their group and others, they want to consider their in-group more virtuous (see Ellemers, 2017). In the case of tolerance, groups may be strongly motivated to identify and maintain the moral high ground of being people who tolerate. Although this does not have to mean that the tolerated are evil, it introduces a relative intergroup differentiation in favor of those people who tolerate. In this context, then, being tolerated implies a morally disadvantaged and inferior position because it involves an unfavorable intergroup comparison with a more virtuous other.",

With toleration, there typically is no full inclusion or equal footing with the majority.1 This means that the practices and policies of toleration can be perceived as confirming and justifying existing power differences and the subordinate position of the minority group (i.e., second-class citizen). This perspective was expressed in a public speech by Leroy Lucas, a Black activist, who said, \u201cI refuse to be a bit-player who is tolerated in his own house. White Dutch people talk about the tolerant Netherlands. Let me be clear: I refuse to be tolerated in my own country\u201d (\u201cIk weiger,\u201d 2015, para. 5). The powerful define the terms and limits of toleration. For example, beliefs and practices related to minority group identities (e.g., not shaking hands with people of the opposite sex, wearing of a headscarf) can be confined to the private domain, whereas the general normative principles and values of the majority group apply to the public sphere. A policy of toleration can thus imply the privatization of immigrants\u2019 cultures (e.g., Yogeeswaran, Dasgupta, Adelman, Eccleston, & Parker, 2011), such as in Denmark\u2019s assimilation policy. Although minorities are not coerced into adopting the majority culture, they are expected to keep their own culture as much as possible in the private sphere (Tawat, 2014), which means that true believers can only be Muslim, Christian, or Jewish at home or in their own religious community.",

Minority members demonstrate either vulnerability or resilience, and biopsychosocial research demonstrated that discrimination can also be experienced as a challenge and a possibility for improvement (Scheepers, 2013).

Although situations involving discrimination can sometimes be ambiguous, this is even truer in situations in which one is tolerated, similar to the ambiguous nature of microaggressions (Lui & Quezada, 2019). In general, minority individuals can be aware of the societal disapproval of their dissenting cultural and religious beliefs and practices. Most Muslim minorities are aware that many majority members evaluate Islamic beliefs and practices negatively (e.g., Pew Research Center, 2017), and most immigrant groups know that some of their cultural beliefs and practices are considered normatively deviant (e.g., Huijnk & Andriessen, 2016). At the same time, it might be more difficult to recognize that these negative evaluations do not lead to discriminatory behavior but rather to toleration. The majority can explicitly state that some beliefs and practices will be put up with, or minority members can experience that they are conditionally allowed to practice their culture or religion (e.g., in private but not in public). But minority members\u2019 awareness that others tolerate their dissenting cultural practices still forces them to determine what attributions to make about specific incidents that they encounter.",

The resulting ambiguity can be cognitively demanding and taxing and might lead to relatively strong feelings of uncertainty that consume cognitive resources and threaten a sense of predictability and control (Guinote, Brown, & Fiske, 2006). Furthermore, research has demonstrated that positive behaviors can be attributionally ambiguous and minorities can sometimes regard such behavior from majority members with suspicion and uncertainty. To convey a nonprejudiced image, majority members sometimes show support and amplify their positivity toward members of ethnic and racial minorities (e.g., Mendes & Koslov, 2013). As a result, it is difficult for minority members to tell whether these positive responses are genuine or should be viewed with skepticism. Tolerance may be a source of uncertainty and threat when minorities suspect that majority members are motivated by a desire to appear tolerant and are hiding group-based antipathy behind more principled claims of disapproval (see Major & Kunstman, 2013). The uncertainty might make targets on guard during daily interactions, resulting in a vigilant state associated with maladaptive cardiovascular responses that in time can have negative health outcomes (Derks & Scheepers, 2018). In addition, the uncertainty can also undermine one\u2019s self-confidence and sense of belonging and reduce one\u2019s task motivation and performance (Mendoza-Denton, Goldman-Flythe, Pietrzak, Downey, & Aceves, 2010; Shelton, Richeson, Salvatore, & Hill, 2006).",

Some empirical evidence for these different psychological consequences is supported by research that found that being tolerated had more beneficial consequences for positive affect compared with perceived discrimination but less positive outcomes compared with the feeling of being accepted and recognized (Cvetkovska, Verkuyten, & Adelman, 2020).",

However, a key aspect of being tolerated, as well as facing discrimination, is that one\u2019s minority group identity is at stake, which means that social identity processes are involved (Verkuyten, Thijs, & Gharaei, 2019). Therefore, a social identity perspective can provide a theoretical understanding of the psychological implications of being tolerated. Specifically, notions developed in identity process theory (Breakwell, 1986; Vignoles, 2011) and the concept of social identity threat are useful to discuss the mediated relation between being tolerated and its possible personal, interpersonal, and intergroup consequences (see Fig. 1).",

Thus, individuals would be motivated to adopt and construct social identities that allow them to think positively about themselves in relation to others, give them the feeling that they belong to groups, make them feel competent and in control, and provide them with a sense of certainty about who and what they are.",

For example, in research among Kurdish minority members, LGBTI members, and disabled people living in Turkey, higher perceived tolerance was associated with a lower sense of identity-based self-esteem, belonging, and control (Bagci et al., 2020). These associations were found over and beyond the negative correlates of perceived discrimination. In research among ethnic minority members in the United States, it was found that independently of perceived discrimination, perceived toleration was negatively associated with a sense of control (Cvetkovska, Verkuyten, Adelman, & Yogeeswaran, 2020). As shown in Figure 1, we propose that the two key elements of being tolerated are likely to threaten different identity needs with negative consequences for the tolerated persons. The devaluation aspect of toleration is most likely to be associated with reduced feelings of self-esteem and a reduced sense of belonging, whereas noninterference is expected to be especially problematic for a sense of control and a feeling of uncertainty.",

People\u2019s sense of control and efficacy is linked to their social identity and the perceived ability of themselves as group members and of their group as a whole to achieve its goals (Vignoles, 2011). The need for control can be one reason why minority members tend to minimize or underestimate the discrimination that puts their lives in the hands of others (Crocker & Major, 1989; Ruggiero & Taylor, 1997). Being tolerated implies that to some extent, what one can do depends on others\u2019 continuing goodwill and the conditions that they choose to set. This situation can diminish a sense of control and efficacy to freely determine one\u2019s own life. It can make minority members feel restricted in their identity choices and less authentic, which results in negative affect and lower well-being (Sanchez, 2010).",

            "text": "The conditional noninterference might also increase uncertainty. There is the ever-present risk of losing permission that has been granted and fear that prohibitions or restrictions of certain practices may emerge. For example, the past decade saw a diminishing space for tolerance of Muslim minority practices in various Western countries. There is an increasing sense of conditional acceptance of Muslim practices, which has been described as a new type of liberal intolerance (Mouritsen & Olsen, 2013). Because tolerance depends on the goodwill or mercy of the dominant group, it can create a sense of uncertainty about whether it will be possible to continue to live the life that one wants. Different lines of research have argued for the role of uncertainty regarding one\u2019s personal and social identity in well-being and psychological functioning. For example, uncertainty-identity theory (Hogg, 2001), the status-based identity uncertainty model (Destin, Rheinschmidt-Same, & Richeson, 2017), the uncertainty management model (Van den Bos, 2009), the need for cognitive closure (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994), and loss aversion (Tversky & Kahneman, 1991) all point toward the role of uncertainty in psychological functioning. Feeling uncertainty about the social world, oneself, or one\u2019s in-group is highly aversive and can lead to negative health outcomes (Derks & Scheepers, 2018). It is often linked to feelings of unease, anxiety, and distress, which motivate attempts at uncertainty management and resolution (Hogg, 2001; Van den Bos, 2009).",

However, discrimination experiences differ considerably in their specific features. For example, having to deal with long-term and pervasive discrimination can be expected to have a more detrimental effect compared with a single incident of discrimination. And facing discrimination in various social contexts or by many people is likely to be more problematic than facing discrimination in a single context or by a single person. Furthermore, individuals differ in their coping strategies and the emotional and practical support that they can draw on in dealing with discrimination (Major et al., 2018). It is likely that similar factors and conditions are also relevant for understanding the negative psychological consequences of being tolerated over and beyond those of discrimination experiences.",

It could lead to strategies of identity concealment (e.g., Plante, Roberts, Reysen, & Gerbasi, 2014; Quinn & Earnshaw, 2011) and avoidance strategies in fear of provoking the dominant other, which leads to engaging in behavior that reduces or prevents interference in their lives (e.g., taking off one\u2019s headscarf in public places).

An admission that one\u2019s minority group or other minority members are discriminated against implies a devaluation of the minority in-group and the possibility that one could experience the same in the future. Furthermore, meritocracy beliefs can lead individuals to perceive another\u2019s failure as indicative of a lack of deservingness (McCoy & Major, 2007). As a result, people who attribute their disadvantaged situation or unfavorable outcomes to subtle (but also overt) discrimination are perceived as complainers and as avoiding personal responsibility for their outcomes (Garcia et al., 2005; Kaiser, 2006). The self-presentation concerns this elicits can lead to minority members being less likely to make attributions to discrimination (Sechrist et al., 2004; Stangor, Swim, Van Allen, & Sechrist, 2002).",

Although people in many places across the world recognize that it is wrong to discriminate (and it is illegal to do so in many countries), they may not as easily recognize the potential harms of being the target of toleration. First, tolerance is typically seen as morally praiseworthy, which makes it difficult to demonstrate to others how toleration may be harmful. Second, whereas discrimination implies interference, toleration involves noninterference, and it might be difficult to convince others, including bystanders (Krolikowski, Rinella, & Ratcliff, 2016), of the harmful consequences of being tolerated. As a result, complaints about toleration might be seen as unreasonable, unjustified, and demanding, similar to the discrediting of those who contest subtle biases (Jones, Peddie, Gilrane, King, & Gray, 2016; Lui & Quezada, 2019).

But not discussing the negative aspects of toleration can cause targets of toleration to feel angry and disappointed, especially among people who think that they should directly confront it (Shelton et al., 2006). People may try to avoid majority group members and start to withdraw from society. Feeling devalued and being conditionally accepted implies a sense of vulnerability that may lead to distancing oneself from people whose acceptance cannot be fully trusted. Research on interracial interactions found that minority members are wary regarding interactions with majority members in which they might feel devalued, rejected, or conditionally accepted (Shelton & Richeson, 2006). Furthermore, feelings of uncertainty, as well as a lack of belonging, control, and not being valued, can lead to a segregationist orientation on one\u2019s minority community that is more likely to furnish these feelings and thereby protects one\u2019s well-being (Hogg, 2001; Schmitt & Branscombe, 2002). Feeling devalued and conditionally accepted may lead people to seek alternative groups that fulfill their various needs, and their minority community is likely to do that. However, distancing from dominant society does not come without social costs and may also lead to the dominant group penalizing that act.",

The social identity model of collective action (Van Zomeren, Postmes, & Spears, 2008) proposes that perceived injustice, a sense of collective efficacy, and a strong (politicized) minority identity independently and in combination predict collective action. These three aspects might imply that compared with, for example, experiences with overt or subtle biases (Sohi & Singh, 2015), toleration could lead minority members to attend less to group-based disparities and thereby decrease collective action that challenge disparities.",

The belief that one\u2019s minority group is capable of addressing group-related disadvantages and grievances is a critical ingredient in collective action (Van Zomeren et al., 2008). A perceived lack of control undermines a sense of group efficacy and may reduce the willingness of the tolerated to act collectively against social injustice and inequality. Furthermore, toleration discourse emphasizes that people are permitted as much as possible to live the life that they want. This idea might stimulate the belief in an individual mobility structure in which societal failure stems from individual shortcomings rather than group disadvantages that should be addressed as a collective (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). It can lead minority members to attend less to group-based disparities and to engage less in collective action that challenge these disparities.",

Social-identity theory proposes that identification with the disadvantaged group predicts engagement in collective action (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Stronger group identification is associated with a greater commitment to one\u2019s group and involvement in trying to achieve group goals. Identification serves to mobilize people for social change, especially when there is a politicized collective identity that focuses on the struggle for power in the public domain (Simon & Klandermans, 2001). Whereas perceived discrimination tends to increase minority group identification and thereby engagement in collective action (e.g., Stronge et al., 2016), there is empirical evidence among ethnic minority groups in the United States and the Netherlands that perceived toleration is not associated with minority group identification (Cvetkovska, Verkuyten, & Adelman, 2020; Cvetkovska, Verkuyten, Adelman, & Yogeeswaran, 2020). Rather, being tolerated might lead minority group members to feel sufficiently part of the larger society to not rely on their minority identity and seek collective action, all without actually having an equal position.",

Minority members will differ in the extent to which characteristics and meanings associated with their minority group are endorsed as self-descriptive (Ashmore, Deaux, & McLaughlin-Volpe, 2004). It might make a difference whether self-attributed beliefs and practices that are tolerated are central to one\u2019s minority identity. Group membership can be defined by the presence or absence of necessary features that function as minimal criteria. For example, wearing a headscarf can be construed as a necessary requirement for being a true Muslim woman (Hoekstra & Verkuyten, 2015), speaking the ethnic language can be considered necessary for being a true ethnic group member (B\u00e9langer & Verkuyten, 2010), and a belief in a specific god can be considered critical to be a true believer. Practices and beliefs that are considered defining parts of a social identity directly implicate what it means to be a group member. Disapproval of these defining aspects is likely to be more hurtful than facing disapproval of beliefs and practices that are less central to one\u2019s minority identity. It probably has a larger negative psychological impact when the religious doctrines of one\u2019s faith are considered misguided, oppressive (e.g., patriarchal), and morally wrong than when more \u201csecondary\u201d religious beliefs are involved. Both can be grudgingly endured, but the dismissive concession is likely to be more meaningful in relation to the former compared with the latter. Yet the conditional noninterference of tolerance also implies that one is able to practice one\u2019s religion, which is especially important for those who are strongly committed to their religious doctrines. Strong believers (e.g., Hasidic Jews, orthodox Muslims) might be especially concerned about their religious freedom rather than about the disapproval attitude of religious outsiders who can be considered inherently different and thus mostly irrelevant.",

Minority members typically identify with ethnic, national, religious, and other groups in various combinations and with varying multiple jeopardies. Belonging to multiple marginalized groups or a mix of advantaged and marginalized identities can differentially affect one\u2019s experiences given their unique placement on these intersecting identities. Facing double disapproval with the related conditional noninterference might change the perceived likelihood, nature, and impact of experiencing tolerance. For example, Eastern Orthodox immigrants may find greater belonging in Western nations relative to orthodox Muslims, who are more tolerated. Likewise, people of color may find belonging in a religious community, but homosexuals of color may experience mainly tolerance (\u201caccept the sinner but not the sin\u201d). The way that individuals react to experiences of being tolerated may depend on how they cognitively and psychologically organize and integrate their multiple identities (Roccas & Brewer, 2002). Individuals with a more integrated multiple identity tend to be better able to cope psychologically and socially with negative experiences (Nguyen & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2013).",

However, minority members often have a preference and tendency to make intragroup comparison over comparisons with the majority group (Leach & Smith, 2006; Major, 1994; Zagefka & Brown, 2005). The greater availability and assumed similarity and diagnosticity of in-group member makes them more meaningful points of comparison for what is important, what to believe, and how to act. In addition, individuals tend to behave in ways that conform to the norms and demands of their in-group to secure acceptance as an in-group member (Klein, Spears, & Reicher, 2007). Recognizing these important intragroup processes, Tajfel (1978) pointed out that feelings about oneself are at least as much, if not more, contingent on intragroup than intergroup comparisons.

However, a societal emphasis on toleration of cultural diversity might inadvertently support domination of minorities within minority communities (Verkuyten, Maliepaard, Martinovic, & Khoudja, 2014). The \u201cin-group domination objection\u201d toward policies of toleration implies that majority group members\u2019 noninterference in minority beliefs and practices can create, maintain, and justify intragroup relations of dependency and oppression (Lovett, 2010). For example, traditional gender values of many religions and cultures can support patriarchal relations (Green, 1995; Okin, 1999), whereas apostasy, homosexuality, and other acts might result in intragroup oppression, shunning, and even death threats. Ethnic and religious identity is typically strongly debated and shaped by interactions with in-group members. Through intragroup communication and so-called norm talk (Keblusek, Giles, & Maass, 2017), individuals control and negotiate normativity, which enables them to define appropriate conduct and deviance. One example is that a few years ago in some areas of London, orthodox Muslims were spreading posters with \u201cYou are entering a Sharia controlled zone.\u201d The posters suggested that alcohol, high heels, drugs, music, and gambling were forbidden in the area.

The institutionalization and public endorsement of civil liberties and democratic values (Weldon, 2006), the degree of religiosity or secularism (Helbling, 2014; Van der Noll et al., 2018), dominant diversity ideologies and policies (Guimond, de la Sablonniere, & Nugier, 2014), citizenship criteria (Yogeeswaran & Dasgupta, 2014), existing migration and integration policies (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997), and the degree to which intergroup relations in society are considered to be stable and legitimate (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) might all be relevant for the experience of being tolerated. For example, toleration can go together with a relatively secure status for members of minorities as citizens with equal rights and opportunities (Galeotti, 2002). Respect for their legal status together with the necessary institutional safeguards ensures (to some degree) that minority members live less with the threat of arbitrary interference. And this is even more likely when there are strong societal norms of solidarity and civility (Honohan, 2013; Petit, 1997). Likewise, the effects of being tolerated on minority outcomes may also vary depending on the extent to which authoritarian versus egalitarian norms and ideals (power distance; Hofstede, 1984) define the national identity. In nations characterized by low power distance and egalitarian ideals, minority groups may experience more negative psychological outcomes because of the mismatch between societally driven expectations and actual experiences. However, in nations characterized by high power distance and hierarchical relations, being tolerated may be seen more strongly as a concession from the dominant group, and minority groups may see tolerance as relatively normative because hierarchies are inherent within the wider society. Whether, when, and how exactly various contextual conditions are relevant in moderating basic psychological processes involved in being merely tolerated are important avenues for future research.",

Toleration offers the possibility to accept dissenting beliefs and practices without giving up one\u2019s own beliefs and convictions, protects minority and marginalized group members from discrimination and violence, provides access to rights and resources, and gives opportunities to live the life that they want.

For example, researchers using physiological measures could examine whether and when toleration has a threatening meaning or is considered a challenging opportunity for minority group members (Major & Kunstman, 2013; Scheepers, 2013). Likewise, researchers could examine whether intergroup contact with majority members provides a new or different perspective on the reasons and meaning of being tolerated. In such work, it is also important to take a relational approach and systematically examine actual interactions in which episodes of toleration occur, similar to research on interracial interactions (Richeson & Shelton, 2007). Researchers studying the consequences of discrimination could also examine the role of different legitimizing ideologies such as a belief in a just world and meritocracy beliefs (Major et al., 2002) in shaping reactions to being tolerated. These ideological beliefs might affect whether people perceive themselves or their group as being merely tolerated and whether they experience this as threatening. In addition, it would be useful to conduct longitudinal research that considers the temporal features of being tolerated. People\u2019s feelings about being tolerated can gradually change; the initial indignation and anger may be replaced by resignation and avoidance.",

This is unfortunate for theoretical and applied reasons. Toleration implies a specific form of disapproval and noninterference (putting up with), which makes it different from other behaviors, including discrimination and acceptance. Because toleration is widely promoted across a wide range of settings and across the political spectrum for establishing multicultural justice and peaceful coexistence, it is important to systematically investigate the different complexities and paradoxes involved in toleration. Although prior work provided a theoretical account of the social psychological processes involved in toleration (Verkuyten & Yogeeswaran, 2017; Verkuyten, Yogeeswaran, & Adelman, 2020), in this article, we delve deeply into what it means to be tolerated and the possible implications for minority and disadvantaged target individuals. We tried to offer a mapping of a terrain that is largely unexplored by psychologists by identifying important questions and theoretical avenues to explore and develop. Acknowledging the continued and increased importance of intergroup toleration does not mean that we should ignore their possible negative consequences. On the contrary, a focus on possible negative consequences allows us to make progress in finding more viable approaches to multicultural diversity and in our theoretical thinking and the development of novel research questions.",
