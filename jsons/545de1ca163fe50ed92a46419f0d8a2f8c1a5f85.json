This is a novel coronavirus; much is unknown as to how it will affect people with IBD. We also lack information about the impact of different immunosuppressive medications. To address this uncertainty, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) COVID-19 IBD Working Group has used the best available data and expert opinion to generate a risk grid that groups patients into highest, moderate and lowest risk categories. This grid allows patients to be instructed to follow the UK government's advice for shielding, stringent and standard advice regarding social distancing, respectively. Further considerations are given to service provision, medical and surgical therapy, endoscopy, imaging and clinical trials.",

Data reported from 1099 Chinese patients with COVID-19 did not observe immunodeficiency as a risk factor for severe disease (defined according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community acquired pneumonia). 4 The currently understood predictors associated with COVID-19 mortality at the time of hospital admission are older age (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17 per year increase), higher No specific recommendations are being made regarding IBD and pregnancy, and pregnant women with IBD are encouraged to follow the guidance available from the UK government for pregnant women in the general population. This guidance was last updated by the BSG COVID-19 IBD Working Group on 2 April 2020, and was based on expert opinion and the available evidence at the time. *The UK government advises those at increased risk, but not reaching the highest risk, of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent when applying social distancing recommendations. \u2020That is, at least one of (comorbidity listed above or age \u226570 years) plus at least one of (therapy from middle column or moderate to severely active disease). \u2021Patients should be categorised as highest risk (requiring shielding) within 6 weeks of starting biologics if they are on concomitant immunomodulator treatment or systemic steroids, whether started simultaneously or prior to the biologic. After 6 weeks they may enter the 'moderate' risk category provided they do not meet other highest risk criteria, for example, moderate-severe disease not controlled by treatment. Biologic plus immunomodulator in stable patients may increase the risk over monotherapy but there is no specific evidence for this situation. \u00a7As judged by the clinical team responsible for patient care. \u00b6Patients who have stopped biologics or immunomodulators should remain within their pre-treatment cessation risk category for 3 months; for drugs with a much shorter half-life (eg, tofacitinib), we advise clinician discretion. 5-ASA, 5-aminosalicylic acid; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; TNF, tumour necrosis factor. sequential organ failure assessment score (OR 5.65; 95% CI 2.61 to 12.23) and d-dimer >1 \u00b5g/mL (OR 18.42; 95% CI 2.64 to 128.55). 5 However, smoking, comorbidity, particularly hypertension, vascular disease, diabetes and male sex have been associated with poor outcome. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Prolonged illness and complications from respiratory infection are perhaps more common when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used, but no data in COVID-19 currently exist. 10 11 Given NSAIDs have also been implicated in IBD flare, paracetamol is advocated as firstline analgesia/antipyretic. 12 At the time of writing, the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE)-IBD registry has reported 239 (54% male) cases of COVID-19 in IBD patients (137 CD, 94 UC, 5 IBD unclassified), of whom 64 were hospitalised and 11 patients died. 13 Seven patients underwent ventilation. Among the 11 patients who died, a range of medications were seen; five patients were receiving mesalazine alone or no therapy, although all were aged 69 years or older; four were receiving steroids alone or in combination; and the youngest patient who died was 33 years and was receiving combination therapy with adalimumab, azathioprine and prednisolone. 13 The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), in line with the International Organisation for the Study of IBD and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation, recommend that patients with IBD do not routinely stop their medication to prevent infection or adverse outcome with COVID-19. 14 15 'Social distancing' (https://www. gov. uk/ government/ publications/ covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-andfor-vulnerable-people/ guidance-on-social-distancing-foreveryone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults) and 'shielding' (https://www. gov. uk/ government/ publications/ guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremelyvulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/ guidance-on-shielding-andprotecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid- 19) are measures to reduce spread within the population and to protect high risk groups. These are also an understandable source of anxiety for patients with IBD. 16 On behalf of the BSG, a UK-wide IBD COVID-19 Working Group has been established and has defined patient risk as highest, moderate and lowest for COVID-19 related poor outcome (see table 1 and below for justification of groupings). Patients classified as at highest risk, correspond to group 5 in the UK government's instruction to undergo 'shielding', the most stringent form of isolation. The moderate group are recommended to be even stricter at following the government's instructions regarding social distancing. Note that all patients should still attend for infusions of biologics, irrespective of risk stratification.",

Patients may self-identify into risk group (https://www. ibdregistry. org. uk/ covid-19) and/or contact their local IBD team (ideally by email). 4. Secondary care IBD teams will then provide patient details to the National Health Service (NHS). The self-identification tool (point 3 above) was developed using the information in table 1 in partnership with the IBD Registry as a pragmatic solution to obtain up to date information from UK patients with IBD and maximise the ability to identify patients in the highest risk group. Early identification and intervention (shielding education) to 318 Chinese IBD patients in Hubei at risk of COVID-19 was well received by patients and may have protected them from infection, with none of them reporting infection, as of 28 February 2020. 17 At the time of writing, there is a lot of activity at UK government level around the wearing of masks by the general population in public spaces and hospitals. The BSG recommends members of the public to follow the most up to date advice from the government with respect to this.",

The grouping has therefore been determined following extensive discussion among UK IBD specialists with input from international colleagues. Based on the current evidence, we understand increasing age, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension are the among the greatest risk factors for poor outcome in COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] As such, priority has been given to these factors alongside medications, other than individuals on high dose steroids (table 1 and below). Where risk is primarily determined by IBD (patient and treatment factors), we recognise this is a dynamic process-that is, patients may move between risk categories over the duration of the pandemic. This is a very busy time for clinical teams with redeployment in order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. We have therefore aimed for simple clear messages wherever possible. For this reason, we have deliberately not provided a drug by drug description of clearance, and recommend it is 3 months after cessation of a drug therapy before a patient changes risk category. In part, this is to discourage the practice of stopping drugs purely to switch risk category. The exception is steroids, which is covered explicitly in the grid. As a working group, we have had some discussion about tofacitinib which has a much shorter halflife; in this case, we advise clinician discretion regarding the time point at which cessation impacts on risk categorisation.",

We will do everything we can to keep you safe and well during the COVID-19 pandemic. Note that hospitals are undergoing massive reorganisation to prepare to care for those with serious infection. 2. Don't stop your medication; preventing disease flares is a priority. We want to keep you out of hospital if possible, but if you are unwell, we will be there for you. 3. Ensure you have a good supply of medication should you need to self-isolate or shield yourself. Do not take steroids (prednisolone) from your general practitioner without discussing with your local inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) team. 4. Contact your local IBD team via telephone or email helplines if you are experiencing a flare. 5. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face; this goes for everyone. 6. Work from home if possible, and avoid non-essential travel and contact with people who are currently unwell. 7. Stop smoking, as this increases the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection, and avoid non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen). 8. Government guidelines on self-isolation and social distancing are changing rapidly so please visit www.gov.uk and www.nhs.uk to keep up to date. (If you are unclear on your level of risk, contact your local IBD helpline for further advice). 9. If you, or a household member, develop a continuous cough, flu-like symptoms OR fever you should: a. follow the government's recommendations about selfisolation and household quarantine b. if you test positive for COVID-19 you should contact your IBD team c. stop taking medicines in the middle column of table 1. Take care of yourself but also be kind and considerate to others in these difficult times.",
