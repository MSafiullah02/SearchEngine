The tissue and species specificities are determined by the presence of appropriate adhesion and entry receptors on the cell surface. Some alphacoronaviruses, e.g., transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV), employ aminopeptidase N, whereas human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1\u20133). At the same time, ACE2 serves as a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a betacoronavirus (4). A number of receptors have been described for betacoronaviruses, including carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 for murine hepatitis virus (MHV), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and major histocompatibility complex class I for human coronavirus OC43 (5\u20139). Furthermore, several alpha-, beta-, and gammacoronaviruses, e.g., TGEV, human coronavirus HKU1, HCoV-OC43, bovine respiratory coronavirus (BCoV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), reportedly use sialic acids for initial attachment to the cell (summarized in reference 10).",

Binding to HSPG is the initial event promoting subsequent recognition of a secondary receptor by increasing the local concentration of pathogens or triggering conformational changes of proteins involved in viral entry. As an example, binding to HSPG induces structural rearrangements of proteins responsible for infection by adeno-associated virus 2 (16), adenovirus types 2 and 5 (17), human papillomavirus 16 (18), and several herpesviruses (19). Furthermore, the majority of oncogenic viruses (hepatitis B and C viruses, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, human papillomaviruses, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1) initially attach to the HSPGs (20). HSPGs can also enhance virulence by binding accessory viral factors necessary for viral replication. This is illustrated by HSPG binding of the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus, which after internalization activates transcription of the viral RNA (21).",

To evaluate protein expression, insect cells infected with bicistronic recombinant baculovirus (rBV) coding for M and E proteins (M+E) and monocistronic N rBV (and optionally monocistronic S rBV) were immunostained and examined under a confocal microscope. Colocalization of the M and N proteins was observed, suggesting the formation of a protein complex within the producer cells (Fig. 1A). To verify whether VLPs were effectively assembled and released, the culture medium harvested from insect cells expressing M, E, N, and S proteins was analyzed by Western blotting. The M (26-kDa), N (42-kDa), and S (150-kDa) proteins were detected in the secreted fraction when insect cells were coinfected with (M+E) rBV, N rBV, and, optionally, S rBV (Fig. 1B). In agreement with our previous studies, the M protein migrated as two bands, reflecting its two different glycosylation states. Similarly, two bands of the N protein were observed, upon electrophoresis, resulting from protein degradation under denaturing conditions (23). In contrast, the apparent molecular weight of the S protein band was higher than expected, most likely because of the glycosylation and/or incomplete denaturation of the protein trimer. Both VLPs, composed of M, E, and N (MEN) and M, E, N, and S (MENS) proteins, were concentrated and purified using a heparin column according to a previously developed protocol (22) (Fig. 1C). The analysis of purified samples by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed spherical particles of different diameters, which might reflect the amount of the N protein incorporated into VLPs (Fig. 1D).",

This confirmed that the S protein is required for particle internalization but dispensable for VLP adhesion. To further validate this result, we blocked the virus-ACE2 interaction with anti-ACE2 antibody, which resulted in inhibition of MENS VLP internalization but not adhesion to the cell surface (Fig. 3). Interestingly, for MENS VLPs, we observed a higher number of viral particles on cells preincubated with anti-ACE2 antibodies. We believe that this is an artifact, as during entry, VLPs fuse with cellular membranes, which results in diffusion of the fluorescence signal and a decrease of the score. Blocking of the interaction with the cellular receptor hampers VLP-cell fusion, and the scored number of particles remains high. Adhesion of MEN VLPs to cells was not affected by inhibition of the VLP-ACE2 interaction. Altogether, these observations indicate that S protein of HCoV-NL63 is not involved in virus attachment to target cells.",

While initial binding is usually nonspecific and mediated by ubiquitous molecules, such as sugars or glycoconjugates (glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans), the second step requires a highly specific interaction with the entry receptors, often involving their proteolytic processing. In some viruses, a single protein is responsible for both steps of this interaction, whereas in other viruses (i.e., paramyxoviruses), different structural elements of the virion are employed for the attachment to and fusion with the cellular membrane (26). This sophisticated interplay of distinct receptor entities and their sequential engagement increase viral avidity and coordination in time for key events for efficient cellular uptake.",

This large (\u223c150-kDa) glycoprotein consists of three segments: an ectodomain, a transmembrane anchor, and a short endodomain. The ectodomain can be further divided into S1 and S2 subunits, although not all coronaviruses undergo enzymatic cleavage of the S ectodomain (29). Different experimental approaches demonstrating that the S1 domain encompasses one or more receptor binding sites (RBSs), located at its C terminus, have been reported for almost all studied CoVs. While the C-terminal part of the S1 domain (S1-CTD) is highly divergent and responsible for the interaction with entry receptors, the more conserved N-terminal region of S1 (S1-NTD) is thought to function as a ligand for the initial attachment factors. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the S1-NTDs of several coronaviruses bind carbohydrates. Examples include the alphacoronavirus (TGEV), betacoronavirus (HCoV-HKU1 and BCoV), and gammacoronavirus (IBV) genera (30\u201333). In contrast, the S2 domain presumably participates in the fusion of the cellular membrane with the viral envelope (34). This was confirmed for a number of coronaviruses, including HCoV-229E (35), SARS-CoV (36), MHV (37), and HCoV-NL63 (38).",

Some authors speculate that S1 also contains a domain responsible for binding to the attachment receptors on the cell surface, which triggers binding with ACE2 (27, 41). Of note, it has been shown that purified full-length S protein of HCoV-NL63 exhibits surprisingly low-affinity binding to its putative receptor (43). At the same time, there is evidence that the RBD of the HCoV-NL63 S protein binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than its full-length counterpart and with efficiency comparable to that of S1 of SARS-CoV (40, 41, 44).

            "text": "In the present study, we provide evidence that the M protein may be responsible for the interaction of the virus with cellular HSPG. For this, we have used previously developed VLPs, produced in insect cells, which enable efficient and scalable expression of complex macromolecular structures. First, using confocal microscopy, we showed that adhesion to the cell surface was not abrogated in VLPs missing the S protein. Moreover, blocking the VLP-ACE2 interaction with specific antibodies did not affect adhesion. Next, using flow cytometry, we confirmed that adhesion is mediated by HSPG, since soluble HS blocks the interaction. To identify the ligand involved in this interaction, we decided to first screen the M protein for the presence of putative heparin binding domains. Using a simple peptide array overlay, we identified three regions that may potentially be responsible for such an interaction. The experimental data were consistent with the notion that these regions are rich in positively charged amino acids, lysine, and arginine (45, 46). Subsequently, we verified this result using the predicted topology of the M protein and literature data. Only one site was predicted to localize on the virion surface, and consequently, we assumed that this particular site is responsible for the interaction. This assumption was then proven by an in situ ELISA, which demonstrated that the region from aa 153 to 226 of the M protein binds to cellular HSPG.",

            "text": "Of note, topology prediction algorithms detected four transmembrane domains (TMDs) within the M protein, which is somewhat atypical for coronaviruses (Fig. 6). The C terminus of the M protein is essential for the M-M, M-N, and M-S interactions, and it is thought to be hidden within the virion envelope (6, 47\u201351). However, the exact region of the M protein responsible for these interactions has not been defined for most coronaviruses. Recently, it was suggested that this interaction might rely on structural motifs consisting of several residues dispersed throughout the protein (52). Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that a C-terminally tagged M protein is assembly competent for VLP formation, which supports the four-TMD model of the M protein and the resulting Nexo-Cexo topology. This conclusion was validated by the observation that HCoV-NL63 and NL63 VLP adhesion is hampered by an antibody raised against two peptides corresponding to the distal part of the M protein. Interestingly, this observation was consistent with works of Enjuanes and colleagues (53, 54), who demonstrated a similar M protein topology of TGEV CoV belonging to the same genus (alphacoronavirus) as HCoV-NL63. Hence, we propose that such a unique organization of the NL63-HCoV M protein might be one explanation for its engagement in HCoV-NL63 infection.",

The sequence (6\u00d7His-M153\u2013226) was verified by sequencing. The Escherichia coli BL21 strain was transformed with the recombinant plasmid and precultured overnight at 37\u00b0C.
