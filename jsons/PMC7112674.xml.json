Complement clears immune complexes and cell debris and elicits immediate, highly efficient and tightly regulated inflammatory and cytolytic immune responses to infectious organisms including bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasites (Dunkelberger and Song, 2010). The complement system comprises more than 50 plasma and membrane-associated proteins (Kjaer et al., 2013). Complement activation leads to a proteolytic cascade that culminates with the recruitment of inflammatory cells, phagocytosis and cell lysis (Kjaer et al., 2013). It produces anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a), which are potent proinflammatory mediators, and opsonins (C3b and C4b), which cover the pathogen's surface, mediating phagocytosis. The cascade culminates with assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on the cell membrane, forming pores that lead to cell lysis (Dunkelberger and Song, 2010).",

Independently of the initiation pathway, proteolytic cascades converge towards activation of the major component C3, with subsequent assembly of MAC (Chen et al., 2010). Activation of the classical pathway is initiated on immune complexes by the binding of the C1 complex mainly to IgM or IgG, but also to apoptotic cells, pentraxins and pathogens. On the other hand, the activation of the alternative pathway occurs by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 in plasma. The lectin pathway is initiated by the binding of pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) to carbohydrates or acetylated residues present on the surface of microorganisms (known as PAMPs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or on aberrant glycocalyx patterns of apoptotic, necrotic or malignant cells (known as DAMPs or damage-associated molecular patterns) (Ricklin et al., 2010).",

In fact, different PRMs activate the lectin pathway: oligomers of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), heteromers of collectins 10 and 11 (COLEC10, alias collectin liver 1 or CL-L1 and COLEC11, alias collectin kidney 1 or CL-K1) and oligomers of either Ficolin-1, 2 or 3 (also called M-, L- and H-ficolin, respectively) (Henriksen et al., 2013, Holmskov et al., 2003, Ma et al., 2013). They recognize PAMPs, highly conserved structures present in several microorganisms, such as lipoteichoic acid of Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria, \u03b2-glucan of fungi (Zhu et al., 2005), glycoproteins of viruses (Tarr et al., 2012), protozoa and multicellular parasites (reviewed by (Messias-Reason and Boldt, 2008). They also bind DAMPs, altered carbohydrate patterns on the surface of apoptotic, necrotic and malignant cells (Ren et al., 2014). The dimers, trimers and/or higher oligomers of trimeric structural subunits of these PRMs form complexes with homodimers of serine proteases (known as \u201cMBL-associated\u201d serine proteases or MASPs), which are initially in the form of proenzymes (zymogens) (Kjaer et al., 2013). After binding of these PRMs to their targets, MASPs are cleaved and activated (Dahl et al., 2001, Degn et al., 2009, H\u00e9ja et al., 2012b). Although MASP-2 autoactivates, being long thought to be the central activator of the lectin pathway (Ambrus et al., 2003, G\u00e1l et al., 2005, Matsushita et al., 2000), different authors provided recent evidence that MASP-1, which also autoactivates, has a significant role in activating MASP-2 (Degn et al., 2012, H\u00e9ja et al., 2012b, Kjaer et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Activation was initially supposed to occur through conformational changes similar to those undergone by the C1 complex of the classical pathway (Gingras et al., 2011). More recently, the proteolytic cascade was proposed to initiate through MASP-1\u2013MASP-2 cross-activation. This occurs with comparable efficiency within co-complexes comprised of a MASP-1 homodimer, a MASP-2 homodimer and a pentamer or higher-order oligomer of PRMs, or by clustering and juxtaposition of PRM/MASP-1 and PRM/MASP-2 complexes on ligand surfaces, where the PRMs may not be identical (MBL and FCNs, for example) (Degn et al., 2014). Although MASP heterodimerization (e.g. MASP-1 + MASP-2, MASP-1 + MASP-3) is possible in vitro, its physiological importance is uncertain (Degn et al., 2013, Par\u00e9j et al., 2014). The observation that around 70% of MBL circulate in blood as trimers of trimeric subunits (MBL3 \u00d7 3) associated with MASP-1 or MAp19, or as tetramers of trimeric subunits (MBL4 \u00d7 3) associated with MASP-2 or MASP-3 (Dahl et al., 2001) implies a major role for intercomplex cross-activation in the initiation of the complement cascade. This is also supported by images of 450 kDa MBL/MASP-1 complexes obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy (Kjaer et al., 2015). Non-active complexes may be formed with the truncated proteins MAp44 (also called MAP-1) (Degn et al., 2009, Skjoedt et al., 2010a) and MAp19 (also known as sMAP) (Stover et al., 1999a, Stover et al., 1999b, Takahashi et al., 1999), which lack the serine protease domain and thus functional activity. Once associated with MBL, MASP-1 and 2 seem not to exchange, nor are they competitively replaced by MASP-3 and MAp19 (Laursen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, they can be displaced by MAp44 (Degn et al., 2013).",

The heavy chain comprises the linker and the CUB1-EGF-CUB2-CCP1-CCP2 regulatory domains, i.e. the N-terminal CUB (C1r/C1s, Uegf and bone morphogenetic protein-1) domain of about 110 amino acid residues (CUB1), followed by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of the Ca2+-binding type, of approximately 50 amino acid residues, a second CUB domain (CUB2) and two contiguous complement control protein modules (CCP1 and CCP2). The light chain constitutes the chymotrypsin-like serine protease (SP) domain (reviewed by (Kjaer et al., 2013)). The CUB1-EGF domains are responsible for Ca2+-dependent dimerization of MASP polypeptides, yet CUB1-EGF-CUB2 are involved in the Ca2+-dependent association of MASP dimers with PRMs (Degn et al., 2009, Thielens et al., 2001, Wallis and Dodd, 2000).",

            "text": "MASP-1 was identified in the early 90s as a bactericidal factor with structural similarities to C1s, reactive to Salmonella typhimurium (Takada et al., 1993). The MASP1 gene is located on chromosome 3q27-8 (Takada et al., 1995) and contains 18 exons, which encode three proteins by pre-mRNA alternative splicing: MASP-1, MASP-3 and MAp44 (Fig. 2\n). Exon 1 is not translated and exons 2\u201311 encode the CUB1-EGF-CUB2-CCP1-CCP2 regulatory domains. The first eight exons are common to all three proteins, meaning that they share CUB1-EGF-CUB2-CCP1. Exon 9 is unique to MAp44. Thus, MAp44 lacks the second CCP domain and the entire SP domain (Degn et al., 2009, Skjoedt et al., 2010a). The SP domains of MASP-3 and MASP-1 are encoded by exon 12 and exons 13\u201318, respectively. This explains why both proteins have different SP domains and also differ in the preceding 15 amino acid residues. Interestingly, the sequence encoding the upstream MASP-3 SP domain has no introns and its active serine residue is encoded by an AGY codon, as in MASP-2, C1r and C1s. This reflects a common origin for the unique SP exon, presumably by retrotransposition of a sequence encoding a MASP-3-like factor B encoding protease in ascidians, after the divergence of urochordates, and subsequent gene duplication events. Instead, the active serine of MASP-1 is encoded by a TCN codon, as typical for chymotrypsin genes, turning the MASP-1 encoding sequence representative of the most ancestral serine protease gene of the lectin pathway, appearing as early as in cnidaria (Kimura et al., 2009, Nonaka and Miyazawa, 2001).",

            "text": "MASP-1 was discovered in 1992 as a C1s-like protein associated to MBL (Matsushita and Fujita, 1992). MASP-1 protein contains 699 amino acid residues and a 19 amino acid leader peptide (Thiel, 2007). It is primarily expressed in the liver, being up-regulated by IL-6 during the acute phase response (Knittel et al., 1997). MASP-1 is considered a promiscuous protease because its substrate binding groove is wide and resembles that of trypsin rather than early complement proteases (Dob\u00f3 et al., 2009). Normal MASP-1 concentration in serum/plasma is around 11 \u03bcg/mL (range 4\u201330 \u03bcg/mL), 20-fold higher than of MASP-2 (Thiel et al., 2012). Among patients with different cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, MASP-1 levels were highest in patients with subacute myocardial infarction (median 12 \u03bcg/mL) and lowest in those with acute ischemic stroke (median 8.6 \u03bcg/mL) (Frauenknecht et al., 2013). In addition, the expression of MASP-1 was observed to be up-regulated in primary uterine leiomyosarcoma (Davidson et al., 2014) and in HCV infected-hepatocyte cell lines (Saeed et al., 2013). Having much higher propensity for autoactivation than MASP-2 (Ambrus et al., 2003), MASP-1 activates MASP-2 in heterocomplexes of large oligomeric MBL and produces 60% of C2a responsible for C3 convertase formation (Degn et al., 2012, H\u00e9ja et al., 2012b). In fact, MASP-1 autoactivation seems to control the initiation of the lectin pathway (Megyeri et al., 2013). Nevertheless, MASP-1 does not cleave C4 and therefore is not capable of generating C3 convertase alone (Ambrus et al., 2003). Direct activation of C3 by MASP-1 can occur but is physiologically irrelevant (Ambrus et al., 2003). MASP-1 was reported to be essential for the development of autoimmune-associated inflammatory tissue injury by activating the alternative pathway of complement in an experimental model of inflammatory arthritis (Banda and Takahashi, 2010). Nevertheless, the reported role of MASP-1 on activation of the alternative pathway was not confirmed in humans (Degn et al., 2012). MASP-1 was shown to play a role in the coagulation, cleaving factor XIII and fibrinogen and mediating the formation of cross-linked fibrin, although with a lower catalytic efficiency compared with thrombin (Krarup et al., 2008). In fact, antithrombin in the presence of heparin is a more potent inhibitor of MASP-1 than C1 inhibitor (Presanis et al., 2004). Furthermore, MASP-1 caused obstructive thrombosis in a mouse model of arterial injury (Bonte et al., 2012).",

MASP-3 occurs in serum mainly associated with Ficolin-3, and in lower amounts with Ficolin-2 and MBL (Skjoedt et al., 2010b). So far, the biological role of MASP-3 remains unclear. MASP-3 does not cleave any complement components and it is not inhibited by C1-inhibitor (Zundel et al., 2004; Yongqing et al., 2012). However, MASP-3 may reduce the lectin pathway activity due to competition with MASP's binding sites on the recognition molecules (Degn et al., 2009). Recently, MASP-3 was proposed to have a role in the activation of the alternative pathway in mice (Iwaki et al., 2011), however, in humans MASP-3 seems not to be required for activating the alternative pathway (Degn et al., 2012).",

These results remained independently associated with acquisition of infection after correcting for baseline characteristics, risk factors, and the other lectin pathway proteins in multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Similarly to MASP-3, MAp44 is largely expressed not only in the liver, but also in bladder, brain, cervix, colon and prostate (Degn et al., 2009), and does not behave as an acute phase protein. In contrast to MASP-3, its levels are highest in heart (Degn et al., 2009) and also decrease slightly in serum during the first 6 months after birth (Degn et al., 2010). Normal MAp44 serum levels are around 1.5 \u03bcg/mL (range 0.3\u20133.2 \u03bcg/mL) (Degn et al., 2010, Degn et al., 2009). MAp44 has been associated with cardioprotective effects, preserving cardiac function, decreasing infarct size and preventing thrombogenesis in murine models of ischaemia/reperfusion injury and arterial thrombosis by inhibiting MBL and C3 deposition (Bonte et al., 2012, Pavlov et al., 2012). The inhibitory effect on MBL deposition however, was only evident at pharmacological levels (10 \u03bcg/mL) on N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, bovine serum albumine (GlcNAc-BSA) \u2013 coated, but not mannan-coated plates, which was interpreted as an attenuating mechanism for MBL recognition of endogenous ligands (Pavlov et al., 2012). Yet the precise mechanism enabling MAp44 to inhibit MBL deposition awaits further elucidation. Nevertheless, MAp44 levels were not related to cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases in humans but associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, obesity and hypertension (Frauenknecht et al., 2013).",

Ten haplotypes with these polymorphisms were associated with low, intermediate and high producing haplotypes (Boldt et al., 2011a, Boldt et al., 2011b). MASP-2 deficiency may occur in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for p.D120G, p.156_159dupCHNH and p.R439H variants, due to different reasons. The Asp-Gly substitution in residue 120 disrupts calcium ion binding of the first CUB1 domain in individuals with the p.D120G SNP. This turns MASP-2 and MAp19 unable to bind MBL and ficolins, abrogating complement activation and reducing MASP-2 concentration in up to 0.3% homozygote Europeans (Stengaard-Pedersen et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2007, Valles et al., 2009). Yet the rare duplication of four aminoacids within the EGF domain (p.156_159dupCHNH) was found in Asians and probably results in MASP-2 misfolding (Thiel et al., 2009, Thiel et al., 2007). The p.R439H variant occurs with a predicted frequency of 2.6% among Africans and disrupts the activation peptide of the SP domain of a MASP-2 molecule still able to bind MBL. This probably reduces binding opportunities with full-working MASP-2 in heterozygotes and blocks complement activation in p.439H homozygotes (Thiel et al., 2009, Thiel et al., 2007). Beside these, three other non synonymous substitutions were associated with the modulation of MASP-2 levels, without obvious reasons: p.P126L (in the first CUB1 domain), p.V377A and p.Y371D (in the CCP2 domain) (Schadt et al., 2008, Thiel et al., 2009, Thiel et al., 2007). Interestingly, the g.21370G>T polymorphism responsible for p.Y371D is imbedded within a region with one of the strongest signal of selective sweep in the human genome (Ronen et al., 2013). Furthermore, polymorphisms in introns 4 and 9 were associated with opposite MASP-2 and MAp19 levels, probably due to an interference in mutually alternative mRNA splicing (Boldt et al., 2013a, Boldt et al., 2011a, Boldt et al., 2011b).",

            "text": "MASP-2 was characterized by Thiel and others in the late 90s as an protein similar to MASP-1 (Thiel et al., 1997). It binds MBL and ficolins as a homodimer in a calcium-dependent manner through its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, assisted by the two surrounding CUB domains (Feinberg et al., 2003). Although found sufficient to autoactivate and initiate the lectin pathway of complement (G\u00e1l et al., 2005), MASP-2 is activated by MASP-1 at physiological conditions, afterwards cleaving the complement components C4 and C2, thus generating the C3 convertase C4bC2b. In fact, MASP-1 is required for efficient activation of the lectin pathway (Thiel et al., 1997, Degn et al., 2012, H\u00e9ja et al., 2012a, H\u00e9ja et al., 2012b, Kocsis et al., 2010, Megyeri et al., 2013). Compared to C1s, the serine protease of the classical pathway, MASP-2 is up to 1000 times more catalytic active and up to 50-fold more rapidly inhibited by C1-inhibitor (Kerr et al., 2008). MASP-2 also acts in the coagulation cascade, cleaving prothrombin in the same way as factor Xa, generating cross-linked fibrin covalently bound on bacterial surfaces (Gulla et al., 2010).",

MASP-2 levels lower than 100 ng/mL are considered deficient (Thiel, 2007). MASP-2 levels were lower in myocardial infarction and acute stroke patients, compared with patients with stable coronary arterial disease and controls (Frauenknecht et al., 2013). This is in line with the observation that myocardial ischemia induces complement activation with MASP-2 consumption (Zhang et al., 2013). Among critically ill children, higher MASP-2 levels (around 360 ng/mL) were associated with malignancy, while lower MASP-2 levels (around 150 ng/mL) were associated with cardiac disease (Ingels et al., 2014). High MASP-2 levels were also associated with the development of severe infections in adult patients with haematological cancer undergoing chemotherapy (Ameye et al., 2012).",

It is secreted by the liver to the plasma, and expressed by Kupffer cells with similar median level of MASP-2 (217 ng/mL, ranging from 26 to 675 ng/mL). Nevertheless, only a minor fraction is associated with MBL and ficolins, and this binding occurs with ten times lower affinity compared with MASP-2 (Degn et al., 2011). MAp19 is excreted in human urine and may play a role in the inhibition of calcium oxalate renal stone formation (Degn et al., 2011, Kang et al., 1999).

The majority (95%) of individuals infected with HTLV-1 remain asymptomatic lifelong, whereas others develop severe diseases, such as the HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukemia (Izumo et al., 2000). In a study involving 96 patients of Northwestern Brazil, MASP2 p.Y371D (rs12711521) was associated with susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection. Specifically, aspartic acid at residue 371 was associated with a dominant higher risk for HTLV infection both in heterozygous and homozygous individuals (OR = 2.71 [95%CI = 1.56\u20134.74], P\n < 0.001) and was independent of genetically determined MBL deficiency, also associated with the disease. The possession of both MASP2*371D and MBL2 low-producing haplotypes increased the risk for HTLV-1 infection by approximately 60%, but no association with viral load was seen (Coelho et al., 2013). Although MASP-2 levels were not evaluated in the study, it is known that the p.371D variant is associated with a dominant effect on MASP-2 levels \u2265600 ng/mL, and an additive effect on MAp19 levels \u2264100 ng/mL (Boldt et al., 2013a). Thus, compound MBL deficiency and MASP-2 overproduction may play a role in the susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection. This association however, awaits replication in other cohorts.",

Whereas early increased Ficolin-2 levels correlated with a better response to treatment (Hu et al., 2013), MBL deficiency was associated with no treatment response (Alves Pedroso et al., 2008, Eurich et al., 2012). Regarding MASP-2, Tulio et al. (2011) investigated 104 South-Brazilian patients with chronic hepatitis C and found an association of homozygotes for the p.371D variant with susceptibility to HCV (OR = 6.33 [95%CI = 1.85\u201321.7], P\n = 0.003). Confirming the findings in healthy populations (Boldt et al., 2013a, Boldt et al., 2011a, Boldt et al., 2011b), MASP-2 levels were higher in patients with p.371D, than in those without these variant. Genotypes causing partial MBL deficiency (YA/YO) were also positively associated with HCV infection in the same patient group (Alves Pedroso et al., 2008). Thus similarly to HTLV-1 infection, MBL deficiency and the MASP2*371D variant may exert a synergistic effect that increases susceptibility to HCV infection, but replication within other cohorts is needed to confirm the results.",

In contrast, MBL deficiency was negatively associated with the severity of liver fibrosis (Alves Pedroso et al., 2008). Lower levels of functional MBL protein would be expected to impair the reported thrombin-like activity of the MBL/MASP-1 complex (Ambrus et al., 2003, Presanis et al., 2004), reducing fibrin cross-linking and the generation of fibrotic liver tissue. In fact, based on the premises that both MBL and MASP-1 are mainly produced in the liver and that MASP-1 has a reactivity profile similar to thrombin, a study was carried out to investigate MBL and the MBL/MASP-1 complex in the development of HCV-related liver fibrosis in English patients. Corroborating previous findings that MBL deficiency exerts a protective effect against liver fibrosis, median MBL serum levels were higher in patients with severe liver fibrosis than in those with mild disease (P\n = 0.002). Enzymatic activity of MBL/MASP-1 complexes correlated with MBL levels (Spearman's rho = 0.78, P\n = 0.01) and was also found to be raised in HCV patients with severe fibrosis (171.5 units/min) compared to those with mild fibrosis (80.3 units/min), non-HCV mild fibrosis (41.5 units/min) or controls (24.1 units/min). Moreover, MBL/MASP-1 complex activity remained associated after adjustment for MBL concentration in the multivariate model: OR = 7.26 per log10 units, [95%CI = 2.36\u201322.40], P\n = 0.001 (Brown et al., 2007). Very similar results were obtained by others in an Egyptian cohort, again presenting a strong association of HCV-induced liver fibrosis with the activity of the MBL/MASP-1 complex, adjusted for MBL levels (P\n = 0.003) (El Saadany et al., 2011). Furthermore, both MBL2 and MASP1 genes were up-regulated, presenting higher mRNA expression in hepatocyte cell lines infected with the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV clone, as revealed by two different groups using microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis (Blackham et al., 2010, Saeed et al., 2013). Activated recombinant MASP-1 was actually shown to directly cause hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to differentiate to a myofibroblast phenotype in vitro, as measured both by morphology and by the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) (Saeed et al., 2013). This cell differentiation culminates in the deposition of excess fibrogenic extracellular matrix proteins and may occur through binding to a protein of the Protease-activated Receptor (PAR) family, as suggested for human vascular endothelial cells (Megyeri et al., 2009).",

Even though activated HERVs are rarely found in healthy individuals, MS patients have elevated levels of anti-HERV Gag and Env antibodies in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid directed towards distinct HERV epitopes (Christensen et al., 2007). In a study with 25 cases of sporadic MS and 42 MS patients with familial MS, including 32 unaffected relatives, the authors found a significant negative correlation between MASP-3 levels and seroreactivity to HERV peptides, but only in patients with active disease (Spearman's r\n = \u22120.631, P\n = 0.001). Low MASP-2 levels were also correlated with high MASP-3 levels, again only in MS patients with active disease, but with borderline significance (Spearman's r\n = \u22120.401, P\n = 0.06). Interestingly, higher MASP-2 levels were more common in MBL-deficient individuals, regardless of being affected or not (P\n = 0.0036). In this study, higher MASP-2 expression seemed to occur as a compensation mechanism for MBL deficiency, and higher MASP-3 levels may play a protective role against establishment of the disease (Christensen et al., 2007).",

For this reason, low levels of lectin pathway PRMs have long been proposed as beneficial against the infection, by disfavoring bacterial dissemination into host tissues (Garred et al., 1994). There is in fact evidence for a protective effect of low MBL and Ficolin-1 levels, as well as corresponding haplotypes/genotypes of these genes and FCN2, against the infection and development of lepromatous leprosy, the most severe form of the disease, which is characterized by a strong Th2 response (Boldt et al., 2013b, De Messias-Reason et al., 2009, De Messias-Reason et al., 2007, Dornelles et al., 2006, Garred et al., 1994, Sapkota et al., 2010). In the first study about a possible association between leprosy and MASP-2 levels generated by MASP2 polymorphisms, leprosy patients had lower MASP-2 serum levels compared with controls and a higher frequency of low MASP-2 producing alleles. The p.126L and p.439H polymorphisms, which are associated with MASP-2 deficiency, had a dominant effect on leprosy susceptibility (P\n = 0.007). Yet genotypes composed of intermediate producing MASP2 haplotypes were protective against the disease (P\n = 0.0014). There was also an association between the lepromatous form of the disease and low producing MASP2 polymorphisms. Thus in contrast to PRMs, low MASP-2 levels increased the susceptibility to leprosy per se and to the lepromatous leprosy form (Boldt et al., 2013a). Replication of these studies in other populations is needed in order to confirm these genetic associations.",

In contrast, no association between bacterial infections and MASP-2 levels and/or MASP2 polymorphisms has been found in two independent studies (Carlsson et al., 2005, Haerynck et al., 2012), despite the report of extremely severe lung disease in a cystic fibrosis patient homozygous for the p.120G variant (Olesen et al., 2006).

It affects the heart, joints, nervous system and skin and may progress to rheumatic heart disease, with stenosis of valve tissue and permanent heart damage (Chang, 2012). MBL and Ficolin-2 promote complement deposition on the streptococcal cell wall through binding to GlcNAc (Neth et al., 2000) and lipoteichoic acid (Lynch et al., 2004), respectively. Nevertheless, MBL levels were significantly higher in patients with RHD, than in controls, probably causing undesirable complement activation and tissue damage in RHD patients, whereas MBL2 variants leading to low MBL levels were found to protect against RF (Messias Reason et al., 2006, Schafranski et al., 2004). Instead, MASP-2 levels were found to be lower in 145 patients with history of RF from south Brazil (103 with RHD and 42 without cardiac lesion [RFo]), than in controls. Furthermore, the low MASP-2 producing p.377A and p.439H variants were negatively associated with RF (P\n = 0.02, OR = 0.36) and RHD (P\n = 0.01, OR = 0.25) and haplotypes producing higher MASP-2 concentrations, sharing the intron 9\u2013exon 12g.1961795C, p.371D, p.377V and p.439R polymorphisms increased the susceptibility to RHD (P\n = 0.02, OR = 4.9). Thus, MASP2 gene polymorphisms and protein levels seem to play an important role in the development of RF and establishment of RHD (Catarino et al., 2014).",

Although the classical pathway was initially proposed as mainly responsible for S. pneumoniae opsonization (Brown et al., 2002), neither the classical, nor the alternative activation pathway compensated for the absence of the lectin pathway in MASP-2 deficient mice, which were highly susceptible to pneumococcal infection and failed to opsonize S. pneumoniae (Ali et al., 2012). In fact, these mice presented similar infection survival times and mortality rates to those previously found for C1q and C4 deficient mice, employing the same strains of bacteria and mice, and the same dose and route of infection.",

Another group concomitantly proved both Ficolins-1 and -2 to be essential for survival in ficolin-deficient mice infected with Streptococcus pneumonia (Endo et al., 2012). Taking into account the results in MASP-2 deficient mice, it is not surprising that the first patient described as homozygous for the p.D120G mutation presented recurrent infections, including severe pneumococcal pneumonia (Stengaard-Pedersen et al., 2003). Nevertheless no other investigation was conducted in humans with pneumococcal bacteremia, besides a case-control study with 54 HIV positive patients. In this particular study, the authors did not find any association with three polymorphisms associated with MASP-2 levels (p.R99Q, p.D120G and p.P126L). (Horcajada et al., 2009). In the light of the reported associations of MBL with respiratory infections, including a meta-analysis showing an association between MBL deficiency and death in patients with pneumococcal infection (reviewed by (Eisen, 2010)), further investigations on MASP levels and polymorphisms with susceptibility to pneumococcal disease should be warranted.",

            "text": "Despite of the relative importance of the lectin pathway in fighting P. falciparum infection, MASP1 and MASP2 polymorphisms have only been investigated in placental malaria. Among several variants genotyped in 269 primiparous Ghanaian women, of whom 54% had placental malaria, none of the investigated MASP1 variants were associated with the disease. Nevertheless, the p.439H variant encoded by MASP2 exon 12 showed a protective effect (OR = 0.55 [95%CI = 0.34\u20130.89], P\n = 0.014), especially against the presence of the hemozoin malarial pigment in the placenta, a feature suggestive of chronic placental infection (OR = 0.47 [95%CI = 0.26\u20130.83], P\n = 0.008). There was also a trend for a protective effect against low birth weight (OR = 0.51 [95%CI = 0.24\u20130.99], P\n = 0.057). Furthermore, the allele encoding the major p.126P variant, which occurs in absolute linkage disequilibrium with the allele encoding the major p.439R variant, was found to have the opposite effect, increasing susceptibility to the disease (P\n = 0.005). The p.439H mutation actually disrupts the activation peptide of MASP-2, which is still able to bind PRMs of the lectin pathway, but cannot activate complement (Thiel et al., 2009). The reasons why a dysfunctional MASP-2 protein protects against placental malaria nevertheless are not well understood, especially if taking into account that MBL deficiency presented the opposite effect, increasing susceptibility to placental malaria in the same patient group (Holmberg et al., 2012). Thus, these associations cannot solely be due to balanced/disturbed complement activation, a process dependent on intact MBL and MASP-2 molecules. Phagocytosis is expected to be hampered, since MASP-2 with the p.439H variant is able to bind PRMs of the lectin pathway and thus to block the interaction site with phagocytic receptors (Duus et al., 2010). In addition, p.439H-containing MASP-2 cannot generate opsonizing C3 fragments by complement activation (Thiel et al., 2009). This would mean less hemozoin uptake, explaining the strong negative association with hemozoin placental levels, and less consequent hemozoin-driven inflammation and tissue damage (Kalantari et al., 2013), explaining the negative association with chronic placental malaria. Functional studies on the p.439H MASP-2 variant will possibly clarify some of these issues.",

The causal parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellated protozoan, is transmitted to humans through the sting of a blood-sucking triatomine bug (Lescure et al., 2010). After the infection, the lectin pathway becomes efficiently activated through the binding of MBL and Ficolins-2 and -3 to N- and O-glycosylated molecules on the parasite metacyclic trypomastigotes and amastigote surfaces (Fig. 4\n) (Kahn et al., 1996). The lysis of T. cruzi is dependent on MASP-2, which cleaves C2 and C4. In nonimmune serum depleted of MBL and ficolins, the classical pathway was inefficient to activate the complement response, and the alternative pathway was just slowly activated in the presence of the parasite. Therefore, the lectin pathway seems to play an important role by controling T. cruzi infection in humans (Cestari and Ramirez, 2010, Cestari et al., 2009). This issue is nevertheless controversial in T. cruzi-infected murine models (Gibson et al., 2012, Ribeiro et al., 2015). Susceptibility to T. cruzi infection was not increased in MASP-2-deficient mice, even though this mice lack functional activity of the lectin pathway (Ribeiro et al., 2015).",

Other diseases previously associated with polymorphisms and levels of MBL and ficolins, should be investigated as well.

Activation of the lectin pathway occurs through binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) oligomers, ficolin oligomers or collectin heteromers (CL-K1 + CL-L1), complexed with MBL-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 homodimers (MASP-1 and MASP-2, respectively), to various carbohydrates or acetylated groups on the surface of pathogens (PAMPs: pathogen associated molecular patterns). Like C1s, MASP-2 leads to the formation of the C3 convertase, C4b2a, but its activation is dependent on MASP-1. MASP-1 also cleaves C2. Activation of the alternative pathway depends on spontaneous low-grade hydrolysis of C3 in plasma leading to the formation of C3b. This C3b binds Factor B (homologous to C2) to form a C3bB complex. The cleavage of Factor B by Factor D form the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. Properdin stabilizes this complex. The C3 convertases cleave C3 to C3b, which bind covalently next to the site of complement activation (opsonization). This amplifies the cascade and mediates phagocytosis, as well as adaptive immune responses. The addition of additional C3b molecules to the C3 convertase forms C5 convertases (C3bBbC3b for the alternative pathway or C4bC2aC3b for both classical and lectin pathways). This C3b acts as a binding site for C5 and initiate the assembly of the membrane-attack complex (MAC) by cleavage of C5\u2013C5a and C5b. Whereas C5a acts as a potent anaphylatoxin, C5b forms a complex with C6 and C7, which is inserted in the cell membrane. Thereafter, C8 and 10 \u2013 18 C9 molecules (80 \u00d7 55 \u00c5 each) bind to this complex, resulting in a fully functional MAC (C5b-9). The three pathways converge to this common terminal pathway, culminating with cell lysis and death (Abbas et al., 2012).",

Epimastigotes, which are the flagellated forms in Triatominae vectors, are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. Under natural conditions however, they are never confronted with it. On the other hand, the amastigote and trypomastigote forms infecting humans, resist complement-mediated lysis. Moreover, they use recognition by MBL/ficolins/MASP complexes to invade host cells. Several complement inhibitor molecules are expressed on T. cruzi surface, such as: Gp 58/68 (Fischer et al., 1988), Trypanosoma cruzi-decay accelerating factor (Norris et al., 1991), Complement regulator protein (Norris, 1998), Complement C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning (Inal et al., 2005) and Trypanosoma cruzi calreticulin (Ferreira et al., 2004).
