            "text": "Patients with COVID-19 infection present with pneumonia (ie, fever, cough, and dyspnea). Although fatigue is common, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and diarrhea uncommonly occur. A recent report in The Lancet described the clinical manifestations of NCIP in 41 patients [16]. According to that report, abnormal chest imaging findings were observed in all patients, with 40 having bilateral disease at initial imaging. This early report on the presentation of the NCIP in intensive care unit patients indicated bilateral subsegmental areas of air-space consolidation, whereas in non\u2013intensive care unit patients, transient areas of subsegmental consolidation are seen early, with bilateral ground-glass opacities being predominant later in the course of the disease (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3\n). Serial chest radiography of a 61-year-old man who died of NCIP showed progressively worsening bilateral consolidation during a course of 7 days. Another report on 99 individuals with confirmed NCIP described similar imaging findings, with bilateral lung involvement in 75% and unilateral involvement in 25% [17]. Another study of five individuals in a family cluster with NCIP [18] described bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, with more extensive involvement of lungs parenchyma in older family members. The reported imaging features most closely resemble those of MERS and SARS. No pleural effusion or cavitation has been reported so far in confirmed cases of NCIP, but pneumothorax was reported in 1% of patients (1 of 99) in a study by Chen et al [17]. Overall, the imaging findings are highly nonspecific and might overlap with the symptoms of H1N1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, or atypical pneumonia. The acute clinical presentation and history of contact with a COVID-19-infected patient or history of recent travel to an eastern Asian country (eg, China, South Korea, or Japan), Italy, or Iran should raise clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of NCIP. Although further investigations on the clinical and radiologic aspects of the COVID-19 are ongoing, imaging will continue to be a crucial component in patient management.",

Diagnostic imaging facilities should have guidelines in place to manage individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The novel COVID-19 is highly contagious and is believed to transmit mostly through respiratory droplets, but there is uncertainty as to whether the virus can be transmitted by touching a surface or an item that is contaminated (ie, a fomite). A thorough understanding of the routes of virus transmission will be essential for patients\u2019 and health care professionals\u2019 safety. Droplets have the greatest risk of transmission within 3 ft (91.44 cm), but they may travel up to 6 ft (183 cm) from their source [19]. For the purpose of diagnostic imaging in individuals with NCIP, whenever possible, portable radiographic equipment should be used to limit transportation of patients. On the basis of experience with SARS, the use of a satellite radiography center and dedicated radiographic equipment can decrease the risk for transmission from known infected individuals. If a patient needs to be transported to the radiology department, he or she should wear a surgical mask during transport to and from the department.",
