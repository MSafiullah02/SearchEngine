Viral RNA recombination is believed to be quite different from the process of RNA trans-splicing, since it is not site-specific (Lai 1992) and is apparently associated with the RNA synthesis by viral replicases (Kirkegaard and Baltimore 1986).",

            "text": "Since recombinations occur rarely and randomly, they are only observed if their products can be amplified, cloned, and distinguished against a large background of nonrecombinant RNAs. So far, RNA recombination has been studied in vivo, almost exclusively on viruses or their defective interfering (DI) particles amplified in living cells under selective conditions. Thus, only those recombination events that render the particles infectious have been detected. It is therefore not surprising that most reports on RNA recombination concern homologous recombination, i.e., recombination between similar segments of related RNAs (Lai 1992). The homologous recombination can most readily be accounted for by a copy choice (template switch) reaction mechanism (Cooper et al. 1974), which implies that recombination between RNA molecules occurs via copying of the 3\u2032 portion of the first molecule by the replicase that eventually jumps, together with the nascent strand, to a homologous region of the second molecule where it resumes RNA synthesis. This hypothesis has become commonly acknowledged and has been used to explain both homologous and nonhomologous recombinations, although it has never been proved directly, apparently because of the constraints and uncertainties inherent to the in vivo experimental models. Also, the in vivo experiments have not answered the basic questions regarding the recombination mechanism, such as whether the recombination is performed or promoted by viral replicase, by RNA molecules themselves, or by host cell proteins. Moreover, the in vivo experiments have not definitely ruled out the involvement of DNA intermediates and, therefore, the possibility that recombination occurs at the DNA, rather than at the RNA, level.",

The system utilizes pure RNAs and a homogeneous preparation of Q\u03b2 replicase, the bacteriophage Q\u03b2 RNA-directed RNA polymerase, which is particularly efficient in the RNA synthesis in vitro (Chetverin and Spirin 1995). A recently developed molecular colony technique allowing individual RNA molecules to be grown as colonies (7, 10) was used in this study to detect rare recombination events. Earlier studies have provided evidence for the occurrence of both homologous (Palasingam and Shaklee 1992) and nonhomologous RNA recombination (27, 28, 25) in the Q\u03b2 phage-infected Escherichia coli cells. There have also been indications that RNA can probably recombine in the in vitro Q\u03b2 replicase reaction (Biebricher and Luce 1992).",

These subgenomic RNAs are the most suitable for in vitro studies on RNA recombination, since they are more efficient templates for Q\u03b2 replicase than the genomic Q\u03b2 RNA. Many RQ RNAs have themselves been generated in vivo by intermolecular recombination, and their sequences can accommodate foreign inserts without losing the ability to replicate (Chetverin and Spirin 1995). In contrast to viral genomes, however, RQ RNAs lack genetic markers facilitating the selection of recombinant molecules against a large excess of parent RNAs. To overcome this problem, we devised the following experimental scheme (Figure 1A).\n",

Q\u03b2 replicase can start at the 3\u2032 end of the 3\u2032 fragment and copy it together with the foreign extension, producing a complementary strand.

According to this method, an RNA sample is spread over a thin Q\u03b2 replicase-containing agarose layer, which is then covered by a nylon membrane impregnated with all four ribonucleoside triphosphates. If there are replicable RNAs on the interface between the agarose and the membrane, RNA colonies appear within an hour, each colony containing up to 1012 copies of a single progenitor template (Chetverina and Chetverin 1993). While the replicable recombinant molecules will produce colonies, the nonreplicable fragments of the original RQ RNA will not. This procedure ensures positive selection of the recombination products and allows the number of recombinant molecules to be directly assessed by simply counting the RNA colonies hybridizable with the labeled 5\u2032 fragment. The fragment is not copied by Q\u03b2 replicase and thus its complementary strand does not appear unless recombination occurs. This eliminates the background hybridization problems even when relatively high concentrations of the nonreplicating RNA fragments are used in experiments. The recombinant molecules carrying foreign inserts are detected by hybridizing the colonies with labeled oligonucleotides complementary to the foreign sequences.",

Colonies did not appear in control experiments where the RNA fragments were replaced with the plasmids used for their synthesis (data not shown), which excludes the possibility that recombination is due to traces of DNA in the fragment preparations. The number of colonies corresponded to an \u223c10\u22127 recombination frequency at the fragment concentration of 0.45 nM. The actual frequency might have been higher, since only a fraction (\u223c10%) of RQ135 RNA molecules are capable of producing colonies (Chetverina and Chetverin 1993) and not every recombination product can be replicable. In more dilute samples, the yield of recombinant molecules decreased roughly proportionally to the product of the fragment concentrations, as expected for a bimolecular reaction; that is to say, the recombination frequency was proportional to the RNA concentration. At a higher concentration of the fragments, the number of colonies became too large to be counted. A large proportion of the recombinant RNA colonies were hybridizable with an oligonucleotide targeted to the foreign extensions (cf. Figure 2B and Figure 2C), indicating that the extension sequences were incorporated into the recombination products. In additional experiments, we found that the complementary versions of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments recombined at a similar frequency (data not shown), meaning that the ability to recombine does not depend on strand polarity.",

Since this step does not depend on the presence of Mg2+ (Figure 2B), it could be a noncovalent interaction between the fragments that precedes the creation of a recombinant molecule. Indeed, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments were capable of forming a noncovalent associate (heteroduplex) stable enough to survive electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and gel-filtration in a low-salt buffer (Figure 3A), and annealing of a mixture of the fragments efficiently promoted their recombination at a given fragment concentration (Figure 3B).\n",

To this end, the total RNA was extracted from an agarose lawn containing more than 100 RNA colonies, subjected to reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification, and the obtained DNA fragments were cloned in a plasmid vector. The plasmids purified from randomly picked clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Since each RNA colony contained at least 1011 molecules (as estimated by normalizing the autoradiography spots to a known amount of RQ135 RNA hybridized with the same probe), the extracted material contained at least 1013 recombinant RNA molecules, or 103 times as many as the number of the added 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments. Therefore, any subsequent recombination between the fragments during reverse transcription or PCR amplification could not appreciably contribute to the cloned sequences. In control experiments, the fragment mixture was subjected to the same procedure, except the colony growth was omitted and the fragments were mixed either before (Figure 4C) or after the reverse transcription step.\n",

            "text": "The following observations could be made from inspection of the Q\u03b2 replicase-amplified sequences shown in Figure 4A and Figure 4B. (i) None of the sequences coincided with the primary structure of wild-type RQ135\u22121 RNA (Munishkin et al. 1991), and almost all included, at least partly, the foreign extensions of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments. This observation strengthens the above conclusion that these molecules were formed by genuine intermolecular recombination. (ii) In most cases, crossover sites lay within the foreign extensions and were precisely identified (recombinants A1\u2013A5, B1, and B2). All these recombinants were of a purely nonhomologous type. (iii) Surprisingly, there were no recombinants of a bona fide homologous type expected of copy choice: the nearly perfect homology between the foreign extensions was invariably ignored. Crossover sites were sometimes found within very short (1\u20133 nt) homologous stretches. Almost all of these crossovers involved the vector portion of either the 5\u2032 or the 3\u2032 fragment (recombinants B4\u2013B6). Nevertheless, the recombinant molecules retained the UCCCU/AGGGA helix of the vector RNA (Figure 5), indicating that the relatively large proportion of this type of recombinants might have resulted from their selective amplification at the expense of those molecules in which this helix was distorted. (iv) Contribution of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments to the recombinant sequences was markedly asymmetric: 12 of the 17 clones included the intact 5\u2032 fragment (recombinants A1\u2013A5, B1, B2), whereas the complete 3\u2032 fragment was preserved in only one case (recombinant A5). The latter recombinant molecule was formed by end-to-end joining of the two fragments. Some of the recombinants with the intact 5\u2032 fragment contained one to three extra nucleotides upstream from crossover sites (A2, A3, A5, B2). These nucleotides were possibly added to the 3\u2032 terminus of the 5\u2032 fragment during its synthesis by T7 RNA polymerase (Milligan et al. 1987) or during the subsequent incubation with Q\u03b2 replicase (Biebricher and Luce 1992). (v) All recombinants in which the 5\u2032 fragment was abbreviated were generated in the experiment in which the fragments were preincubated in the presence of Mg2+ prior to contacting them with Q\u03b2 replicase (recombinants B4\u2013B6 and, possibly, B3). Interestingly, these were the recombinants whose crossover sites lay within the short stretches of homology between the fragments (see item [iii]). Although the presence of Mg2+ during the preincubation step did not noticeably influence the recombination frequency (Figure 2B), the latter observation suggests that it might have affected the recombination mechanism. (vi) Crossover sites were not evenly distributed along the 3\u2032 fragment sequence. As seen from Figure 5, they tended to concentrate at or close to the 5\u2032 base of a helix of the putative intermolecular structure formed by the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 fragments. (vii) Eight of the seventeen clones apparently were formed by adding the intact 3\u2032 terminus of the 5\u2032 fragment to the beginning of sequence UCUAGA in the 3\u2032 fragment (recombinants A1\u2013A3, B1). This crossover site was located at the 5\u2032 base of the helix closest to the 3\u2032 terminus of the 5\u2032 fragment (Figure 5). Although five of these clones were identical and had been isolated from one RNA pool (recombinant A1), the probability that all of them were descendants of a single original recombinant molecule was negligibly low, less than 10\u22126, as expected from a random distribution of the material contained in at least 100 RNA colonies among the 9 clones isolated from that pool. Moreover, a clone with the same nucleotide sequence had been independently isolated from another RNA pool (recombinant B1), and there were three more clones in which recombination had occurred in a close proximity to this site (recombinants A4, B2, B3).\n",

Since such sequences did appear only if the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RNA fragments were mixed before the cDNA synthesis step, they seemed to result from a template switch occurring during reverse transcription (Negroni et al. 1995).

Since the fragment contains the hydroxyl group at the terminal 3\u2032 position as a result of transcription, we checked whether the presence of the 3\u2032 hydroxyl is essential. To this end, the 3\u2032 terminal ribose was oxidized with periodate, and the terminal nucleoside dialdehyde was eliminated by treatment with aniline. This resulted in a 1 nt shorter fragment that bears the phosphoryl group at the 3\u2032 end (Steinschneider and Fraenkel-Conrat 1966b). Figure 7A (upper row) shows that such a modification of the 5\u2032 fragment reduced the number of RNA colonies to zero, and that the removal of the 3\u2032 terminal phosphate with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIP) restored the ability of the fragment to recombine. Moreover, recombination could be switched on by adding the phosphatase directly into the sample containing a mixture of the 3\u2032 phosphoryl 5\u2032 fragment and the 3\u2032 fragment (Figure 7B).\n",

The fragments were derived from the RNA sequence by breaking it at the junction site between the in vivo duplicated segments (Chetverin et al. 1992), i.e., these RNA molecules may resemble the natural recombination substrates.

For example, one might argue that elimination of the terminal hydroxyl simply prevents extension of the 5\u2032 fragment on the 3\u2032 fragment complementary strand, which can be synthesized by Q\u03b2 replicase. This could not prevent, however, a reciprocal extension of the newly synthesized strand on the 5\u2032 fragment, since its 3\u2032 terminus was not modified, and only a slight (some 2-fold) reduction in the recombination frequency could be expected. The absence of recombination in this case (as well as in the reciprocal experiment with the complementary versions of the fragments) means that the newly synthesized strand lacked its recombination partner, which must be the missing complementary copy of the 5\u2032 fragment.",

This discrepancy may be partially due to selection pressure that rejects in vivo most nonhomologous recombinants.

A backward extrapolation of the frequency of homologous recombination in Q\u03b2 phage to the RNA concentrations used in our in vitro experiments would give the value of 10\u221213 per 30 nt. Of course, this is a very rough estimate, but it helps to demonstrate that even if the copy choice mechanism operated in the in vitro system as efficiently as in Q\u03b2 phage, it would not, except fortuitously, show up on the million-fold higher background of nonhomologous recombinations.",

Most homologous recombinations occur by a copy choice mechanism, and their frequency is a virus-specific parameter, inasmuch as it is determined by the properties of viral replicases, such as the enzyme processivity. At the same time, nonhomologous RNA recombinations mainly occur via splicing-like reactions, probably nonenzymatic ones, and their frequency is relatively virus-nonspecific, since it is determined by the general properties of RNA, such as its secondary and/or tertiary structure. Given the fact that viruses with a high overall recombination potential (such as picorna- and coronaviruses) predominantly display homologous recombination, one could predict that the relative contribution of nonhomologous recombinations to the totality of recombination events in different viruses would increase as the overall recombination rate decreases, and this largely conforms to the available in vivo data (Lai 1992). For example, most of the nongenomic (satellite) RNAs of Q\u03b2 phage, which are less subject to selection than the genomic RNA, consist of a mosaic of fragments of both viral and cellular origin, i.e., they have formed via nonhomologous recombination (Chetverin and Spirin 1995). This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that the RNA fragments used in this work produced only nonhomologous recombinants when amplified by Q\u03b2 replicase, whereas the same fragments produced only homologous recombinants when they were copied by reverse transcriptase whose template switching ability seems to be even higher than that of poliovirus replicase (Negroni et al. 1995).",

As has been pointed out (Lai 1992), the homologous recombination may be a mechanism to eliminate replication errors, and this could be particularly advantageous for viruses with large nonsegmented genomes and for those encoding large polyproteins. Therefore, the elevated capability of template switch may have been acquired by the replicases of picorna- and coronaviruses as a result of evolution. At the same time, nonhomologous recombinations provide for big and instant evolutionary jumps by enabling a virus to create new genes or to borrow them from other viruses or from the host cell, and they are also responsible for the generation of DI genomes that strongly affect viral infection. The low capability of Q\u03b2 replicase to switch between templates does not allow homologous recombination to be observed in our cell-free system. At the same time, it makes the system perfectly suited to studying nonhomologous recombinations.",

A hallmark of the splicing mechanism is that the 3\u2032 terminus of an attacking substrate is preserved within the recombinant sequence. This is especially easy to discern if the sequence includes the 3\u2032 terminus of an intact RNA, and such recombinants have been reported for viruses of all types of organisms. Q\u03b2 phage satellite RQ120 RNA has been generated by the addition of the 3\u2032 terminus of E. coli tRNAAsp\n1 to the last quarter of the Q\u03b2 coat protein cistron (Munishkin et al. 1988). A number of Sindbis virus DI genomes include the 3\u2032 terminus of rat tRNAAsp attached to the beginning of the viral genome sequence (Monroe and Schlesinger 1983). Also, one half of the experimental recombinants between the genome of turnip crinkle virus and its satellite (sat-D) RNA have been generated by the addition of the 3\u2032 terminus of sat-D to the 5\u2032 base of a hairpin in the genomic 3\u2032-terminal untranslated region (Carpenter et al. 1995), which is reminiscent of the secondary structure requirements for the in vitro recombination.",

Although recombination between cellular RNAs has not yet been experimentally demonstrated, apparently because of the absence of a suitable experimental system, the sequencing of some RQ RNA molecules has shown that they consist of fragments of cellular RNAs only (28, 25). Our data support the hypothesis that the modern splicing systems, together with the exon-intron structure of genes, have evolved from the ability of cellular RNA to recombine (Gilbert 1986).

The primary structures of the resulting constructs were checked by sequencing.
