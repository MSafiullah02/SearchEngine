            "text": "Background: Since the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, Public Health England have developed a suite of real-time statistical models utilising enhanced pandemic surveillance data to nowcast and forecast a future pandemic. Their ability to track seasonal influenza and predict heightened winter healthcare burden in the light of high activity in Australia in 2017 was untested. Methods: Four transmission models were used in forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England: a stratified primary care model using daily, region-specific, counts and virological swab positivity of influenza-like illness consultations in general practice (GP); a strain-specific (SS) model using weekly, national GP ILI and virological data; an intensive care model (ICU) using reports of ICU influenza admissions; and a synthesis model that included all data sources. For the first 12 weeks of 2018, each model was applied to the latest data to provide estimates of epidemic parameters and short-term influenza forecasts. The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored. Results: The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic. Short-term predictions of burden on primary and secondary health services were initially highly variable before reaching consensus beyond the observed peaks in activity between weeks 3-4 of 2018. Estimates for R 0 were consistent over time for three of the four models until week 12 of 2018, and there was consistency in the estimation of R 0 across the SPC and SS models, and in the ICU attack rates estimated by the ICU and the synthesis model. Estimation and predictions varied according to the assumed levels of pre-season immunity. Conclusions: This exercise successfully applied a range of pandemic models to seasonal influenza. Forecasting early in the season remains challenging but represents a crucially important activity to inform planning. Improved knowledge of pre-existing levels of immunity would be valuable.",

            "text": "The evolution of influenza viruses results in annual epidemics of seasonal influenza, with less frequent global pandemics occurring due to the emergence of novel influenza viruses to which there is little population immunity. Both have the potential to cause substantial burden of disease to the population and to present significant challenges to already strained healthcare systems [1] [2] [3] . Many countries have invested substantial resources to developing epidemiological and virological surveillance tools to rapidly detect the onset of the influenza season each year [4, 5] ; to measure the level of activity and the impact on the health service; and to characterise the main circulating virus strains and how well they match the seasonal vaccine. Attempts, however, to undertake seasonal influenza forecasting have been historically challenging due to the complex interplay between the influenza virus, population immunity, and environmental factors [6] . Nonetheless, progress has been made in the provision of short-term predictions of influenza in some countries in recent years particularly in the United States [5, 7] , encouraging similar endeavours elsewhere.",

The availability of these models, together with complementary surveillance and data collection systems including sero-epidemiology for seasonal influenza, provided the opportunity to address the challenge of predicting seasonal influenza activity in England. This became a pressing need, when, following a particularly intense 2017 influenza season in Australia [12] , prior to the winter season 2017/8 the National Health Service (NHS) put in place winter preparedness plans to manage potential acute pressures on the health service [13] . Ultimately, England experienced the most intense influenza season since the first post-pandemic season in 2010/11 [13] . Questions were raised about how the epidemic would evolve, when it would peak, how intense the peak in activity would be, and what would be the resulting demands on the health service, in terms of burden on GPs, hospitals, and intensive care units.",

The model uses daily (or weekly) data on the number of GP consultations for ILI from the PHE influenza surveillance dataset augmented with the RCGP's virological data to estimate the component of ILI due to influenza. In the first week of analysis, the number of ILI consultations due to influenza were simply estimated by multiplying the total number of consultations in sentinel RCGP practices by the proportion of swabs testing positive for an influenza virus, obtaining what we term ILI+. When more detailed data became available, it was possible to model jointly daily ILI counts and swab positivity data, appropriately accounting for the size of the virological samples, and to specify distinct epidemic models in each of five regions in England [22] . A definition of the regions used is available in the Web Extra Material (Section B.1.1). When using ILI rather than ILI+, it is necessary to account for \"background\" rates of consultation, the component of ILI not attributable to influenza. This level of consultation is estimated by fitting an endemic/epidemic model [23] to 3 years of historic ILI data prior to the 2017/2018 flu season.",

Estimates from the Synthesis and ICU models seem also to be consistent, converging to very similar values (1.25-1.26) by ISO week 12 (Panel C).

In the SPC model, the ILI+ data used in 2018w1 are replaced from 2018w2 by separate GP ILI and swab positivity datasets. As a result, the estimated rate of GP consultation drops sharply and becomes much more precise. For the SS and SPC models, estimates of the propensity to consult in GP stabilise, over time, at around 0.5%. Results from the Synthesis model of all three healthcare seeking events, suggest a slightly higher value for the GP consulting rate, a figure of around 0.3% of infections leading to hospitalisation, with a lower estimate, below 0.02% of infections requiring ICU admission, in agreement with the ICU model whose estimates are the most consistent over the period.",

The grey-shaded band on each plot gives the period of time over which peaks in the datasets were observed. Specifically, Panel A shows the evolution of the estimate of the peak week in GP ILI consultations as data accumulate, from some initial, quite heterogeneous, estimates, to a consensus estimate. For the GP consultation rates this consensus, placing the peak between 2018w3 and 2018w8, is only reached after 2018w4. Before that the uncertainty attached to the initial estimates varies substantially by model: the Synthesis model provides volatile results, while both the SPC and SS models are giving by this time a more precise indication on the position of the peak. The SPC model's estimates seem overly precise, perhaps due to a lack of uncertainty in the estimation of the non-influenza ILI consultation rates (see Section B.1 in the Web Extra Material). Note also that the SPC model is able to provide region-specific estimates (Panel B). A similar message comes from the estimation of peak in the ICU rates, with an initial uncertainty diminishing after 2018w4, once a peak in the ICU data has definitely occurred.",

Over time the magnitude of the peak GP activity estimated under each of the three models gradually declines, with the SPC model continuing to estimate slightly higher peak activity. Although more consistent over time, the estimates for the peak intensity in the SS and SPC models again seem to be very precise given the predicted fall in activity over time. In Panel E, the regional estimates for the peak intensity behave in much the same way as the national estimates for R e with a gradual decline over time, with London and the Midlands having the lowest rates of peak activity and the North and South-East the highest. Estimates for the peak levels of ICU activity (Panel F) from the ICU model are very consistent over time, with the estimates from the Synthesis model converging to similar values from 2018w4 onwards. Table 1 presents the forecasts for the attack rates, the cumulative incidence of GP consultation, hospital and ICU admission over the course of the influenza season. These forecasts behave similarly to the forecasts for peak incidence (see Fig. 2d-f ), in that they take a similar amount of time to (panels a-c) and of the log of the rates of GP consultation and admission to hospital and ICU over time per 100,000 infections (panels d-f). In panels d-f estimates are only plotted for models that included the relevant data converge to stable values. However, over time, the attack rate forecasts by the ICU model are steadily increasing (due to a slower than anticipated decline in the number of admissions), whereas those for the SS model are decreasing. There is little overlap between credible intervals from week 5 to week 12 across all models except the Synthesis model where forecasts are significantly less certain.

In places, the credible intervals vanish, where the peak week is predicted with certainty to be in a specific week. Again, region-specific estimates are presented in panels b and e, while only the ICU and Synthesis models forecast the ICU admission rates and only these models feature in Panels c and f be higher than those from the SPC and Synthesis models, whereas forecasts from attack rates of ICU admission are comparable between the ICU and Synthesis models.",

Panel A displays the GP ILI forecasts from the SS model, showing how the model struggles to anticipate the peak in observed consultations early in 2018 and how the forecasts improve over 2018w5-9, after peaks in activity have been observed. Forecasts from the SPC model (Panel  B) show a different pattern, displaying a better forecasting ability in the early period, which degrades over 2018w5-9, before very accurately predicting the GP ILI activity in 2018w12. This lack of forecasting ability over 2018w5-9, however, is due to the overly precise estimation observed above. Across each of the individual regions, the observed ILI consultations over 2018w5-9 fall in the upper tail of the posterior predictive distributions (as exemplified in Panel D for the South West), but they combine to give a national total ILI consultation that lies comfortably above the predictive distribution as seen in Panel B. The Synthesis model forecasts for the ILI data are shown in Panel C. The one week-ahead forecasts appear to perform reasonably well, but there is often high uncertainty attached to the two-week ahead forecasts, at times at odds with the one-week ahead forecast produced the following week. A similar big uncertainty is observed when using the Synthesis model to forecast ICU admissions (Panel E). Finally, the ICU model seems to exhibit good one-week and two-week forecasting performance, with almost all the data points lying within appropriate predictive intervals. However, it is to be noted that none of the observed values lie in the lower tail of the predictive distributions, suggesting some likely under-estimation of the ICU admissions over time.",

We addressed these questions through a number of available transmission models, each sharing a common population compartment structure, that used a range of different standard data streams to make sequential estimation of disease spread, of case/severity indicators, and of future epidemic activity, all as data accumulated over time. Estimates were typically consistent across models using similar information (e.g. the SPC and SS models) and generally more stable towards the latter stages of the season. There is a high-degree of volatility in estimates that rely on the ILI+ data (Synthesis model and SPC model in week 1). This is most likely due to the ILI+ data being reliant on virological swab positivity data that only has a relatively small number of positives. These data then represent a highly noisy signal of flu activity that could easily conflict with the other datasets used by the Synthesis model. Estimation of timing and magnitude of peak activity was particularly challenging, as heterogeneous estimates were obtained from the different models in the early stages prior to observing peaks in the data.",

They each have at their heart deterministic transmission structures relying on assumptions of heterogeneous mixing (in the SPC model this heterogeneity is within regions, not England-wide). Deterministic dynamics are suitable for capturing pandemic dynamics when there is a single circulating influenza strain to which the population is almost entirely susceptible. With seasonal influenza both environmental and demographic stochastic effects will be influential, particularly in absorbing any lack of fit. Here, for example, the single-strain models struggled to adapt to the patterns in the data that are not characteristic of SEIR-type dynamics and in particular the slow decline of influenza activity following the peak. This lead to increased estimates of attack rates in 2018w12. Conversely, the deterministic dynamics of the strain-specific model couldn't account for the presence of low-levels of influenza A/H1 activity without eventually leading to more widespread transmission. The increased flexibility in stochastic transmission models could potentially absorb this lack of fit without biasing estimates to the same extent.",

The initial susceptibility of a population, which is a parameter in the models used here, cannot be estimated through the use of the surveillance streams alone. External knowledge on levels of population immunity prior to the start of the season needs to be provided, knowledge to which estimates of infection spread, attack rates, and case/severity indicators are found to be highly sensitive. The sensitivity study showed that while R e estimates are robust to the levels of initial susceptibility, estimates for the transmissibility (measured by R 0 , see Web Extra Material) are inversely proportional to the susceptibility. Assuming higher initial susceptibility, the unaffected estimates of R e will lead to higher rates of infection, as has been shown elsewhere [28] . To be able to explain the observed data there is a consequent impact on the case/severity ratios, which are estimated to be lower, leading here to differing estimates of (earlier) timing and magnitude of (higher) peak activity if early in the season. To weaken our strong assumption of homogeneous mixing, serological data can be of even further value if they are sufficiently representative (by age, strain, region etc.) to permit corresponding stratification of the transmission model. Additionally, the contribution of influenza vaccine programmes (in terms of uptake and effectiveness) to susceptibility also needs to be taken into account, as the vaccine campaign occurs after the intra-seasonal sero-survey is completed and will clearly further affect the population sero-profile prior to the start of the season. This will have been of particular importance in 2017/18, due to the apparent impact of vaccine-related egg-adaption, which may have reduced vaccine effectiveness against the circulating influenza A(H3N2) strains [29] . Further work on the potential role of sero-epidemiology to improving forecasting needs to be explored [30, 31] and a pilot study is ongoing [32] .",
