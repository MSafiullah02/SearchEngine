An HIV incidence baseline will be estimated primarily using incidence findings from existing studies. HIV incidence in the South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey Study (SABSSM) used a similar incidence bio-marker-based methodology to one adopted for this study. The HIV incidence findings for AGYW 15\u201324 years at the national level was 2.54% (95% CI 2.04\u20133.04) in 2012. An earlier longitudinal study on HIV uninfected 14\u201330 year old women, undertaken between March 2004 and May 2007, revealed that HIV incidence in young girls below the age of 18 years was 4.7 [95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.5\u201310.9) compared to 6.9 (95% CI 4.8\u20139.6)/100 women years (wy) in those aged 18 - 30 [32]. The HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System (HIPSS) situated in uMgungundlovu, KZN, included two cross-sectional surveys between June 2014 and June 2015 and between July 2015 and July 2016. The HIPSS study population was drawn from uMgungundlovu, the same area for this study. The HIPSS incidence in adolescent girls 15\u201319 years was 4.63% (95%CI, 3.29\u20136.52) and 4.00% (95% CI, 2.74\u20135.85) for women 20\u201324 years old in the 2014 survey [33].",

The following criteria were used for the establishment of the SALs. EAs were merged if they fell within the same sub-place (a higher order geographic level); EAs were merged if they had the same geographical properties; an EA was merged if its population that resided there was less than 500 people; and lastly, the resulting SALs must have a population total of 500 or more [37].",

The sample size is based on the required number of AGYW (i.e 18,500) and working upwards to determine how many households need to be approached to realise this sample size. If one in two households have an AGYW [39], to obtain 18,500 we would need to approach 37,000 households (assuming they all agree to participate). However, we anticipate that 20% of households will not agree to participate and about 12.5% are unoccupied or invalid (so anticipate approaching 55,000 households).",

This study will determine the impact DREAMS interventions have had on HIV incidence among AGYW in a \u2018real world, non-trial setting\u2019.

This study would also not be able to determine the long-term impact of DREAMS being limited to information based on data gathered at a specific point in time. The study will only select participants from DREAMS targeted areas with the change in HIV infection rates estimated following the implementation of DREAMS programmes amongst AGYW through computation of the population\u2019s attributable risk. As there is no non-DREAMS comparison arm in the study design, causal inferences regarding the relative contribution of DREAMS activities to measured reductions in key parameters is limited.
