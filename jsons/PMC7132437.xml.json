Persons with exacerbations of COPD enrolled in this study were identified using discharge diagnosis codes (ICD9 codes 491.2, 491.21, 492, 493.2, 496). Study 2 was a longitudinal study conducted between September 1991 and May 1995 to evaluate the incidence of RTVIs in a cohort of 62 patients with COPD.8 The criteria for diagnosis of COPD were as defined by the American Thoracic Society.14 An exacerbation of COPD was defined as meeting one or more of the criteria from Anthonisen et al.15 increased dyspnoea, sputum production or sputum purulence. RTVIs in both studies were identified by virus culture of combined nasal wash/throat swab specimens and by serologic assays as previously described.8, 10 For this evaluation, available samples collected between September 1991 and June 1995 were used for analysis. Combined nasal wash/throat swab samples were transported to the laboratory on wet ice, inoculated onto cell culture (usually within 12 h), and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to the performance of viral RT-PCR assays. Microneutralization assays were used to measure antibody levels to influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3 viruses, and coronavirus 229E. Hemagglutination inhibition assays also were used to measure influenza A and B virus antibody, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure antibody to coronavirus OC43.8, 10\n",

These assays consist of three major steps: (1) nucleic acid extraction; (2) complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and amplification (RT-PCR); and (3) identification of virus-specific amplicons by Southern blot hybridization. Nucleic acids were extracted from nasal wash/throat swab samples using the Q1Amp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc.; Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR/PCR assays were performed as previously described using primers listed in Table 1\n.13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 For detection of human metapneumovirus infection, cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 43 \u00b0C. After an initial 5-minute heat denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, 40 cycles of heat denaturation at 92 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s were followed by a final primer extension at 72 \u00b0C using the PTC 200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Virus-specific PCR products were detected by Southern hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled probes (see Table 1). Human metapneumovirus-specific amplimers were identified following hybridization with a virus-specific digoxigenin-labeled oligoprobe at 50 \u00b0C.",

Falsey et al.37 found up to 10% of subjects admitted with acute cardiopulmonary conditions had serologic evidence of acute human metapneumovirus infection. Prevalence rates were somewhat lower in an ambulatory geriatric population, and there was considerable variability between the two study years. Cases of human metapneumovirus infection also have been observed in elderly patients hospitalized with chronic lower respiratory diseases or immunosuppression.38, 39 In contrast, we failed to identify any illnesses associated with human metapneumovirus infection. Our RT-PCR assay for human metapneumovirus was designed to detect all known groups of human metapneumovirus and has detected these viruses in another study involving hospitalized children (unpublished data), differences in assay performance could explain the results observed. Alternatively, virus circulation during the seasons studied may have been low enough to prevent detection.37\n",

Seemungal et al.9 reported detection of respiratory viruses other than RSV in 16% of COPD patients during clinical stability and detection of RSV in 23.5%. We have recently completed an evaluation of another cohort of chronic bronchitic patients during periods of clinical stability (unpublished data). The prevalence of RT-PCR positivity (excluding coronavirus 229E and human metapneumovirus) ranged from 0 to 2% for individual agents, with an overall prevalence of 6.4% in 143 encounters. The overall frequency of identification of a respiratory viral infection during illness was similar to that seen in this study. Thus, our experience with the application of RT-PCR assays to cohorts with COPD differs from that described by Seemungal et al.9\n",
