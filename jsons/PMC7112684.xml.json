In the structures of MHC I presenting these short peptides, the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of MHC I form a bed-like groove to comfortably accommodate the peptides: two \u03b1-helices as the bedrails and the \u03b2-sheets beneath as the mattress (Bjorkman et al., 1987; Niu et al., 2013). The short peptides interact with the amino acids within the peptide binding groove (PBG) through different binding modes. First, the featured residues at the second position (P2) from the N-terminus and the last residue (P\u03a9) at the C-terminus of the peptides, termed primary anchor residues, protrude into the specific pockets in the PBG of the MHC I. Though the positions of the primary anchors on the peptides are relatively conserved, the binding modes of the anchoring residues of the peptides to different MHC I molecules are diversified due to polymorphisms in the pocket-forming residues. Second, the peptides also interact with the PBG via contacts between the backbone atoms of the peptides and the PBG residues (Mitaksov and Fremont, 2006). Third, a hydrogen bond network is formed between the two termini of the peptides and the conserved residues in the PBG. The latter two interaction modes are relatively conserved between different MHC I molecules (Fremont et al., 1992; Madden et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Generally, MHC I binding peptides are located in the bottom of a ringent PBG, which leaves a solvent-exposed top surface of the entire peptide from the N- to the C-terminus, ready for the recognition of the T-cell receptors (TCR) (Bjorkman et al., 1987). However, based on the structures of a series of MHC I molecules, such as human HLA-B*2705 (Madden et al., 1991), rhesus macaque Mamu-A*02 (Liu et al., 2011), and mouse H-2Kd (Mitaksov and Fremont, 2006; Zhou et al., 2004), there is a salt bridge positioned over the peptides formed by opposite charged residues from the \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices of MHC I, respectively. In humans and macaques, the salt bridge is formed by the positively charged Arg62 on the \u03b11 helix and the negatively charged Glu163 on the \u03b12 helix. Meanwhile, in mice, the involved residues are Arg66 on \u03b11 helix and Glu163 on \u03b12 helix. Both of these types of salt bridges overhang the N-terminal portion of the T-cell epitopes in the groove. Obviously, the salt bridge forms a ligature to tightly fix the peptides into the PBG. However, thus far, it is still largely unknown how the formation of these salt bridges in MHC I molecules impacts peptide binding.",

Generally, T-cell activation by the MHC-peptide complex may occur in three correlated ways: 1) direct interaction of the TCR with the MHC, termed MHC restriction; 2) direct interaction of the TCR with the solvent-accessible peptide main chain and side chains; and 3) interaction of the peptide with the TCR mediated by conformational perturbations in the MHC-peptide complex (Baker et al., 2012; Gras et al., 2012). Crystallographic studies clearly demonstrate that the polymorphic amino acids in the grooves of MHC I molecules from different mammals may influence the peptide conformation, subsequently impacting T-cell recognition (Borbulevych et al., 2009; Hulsmeyer et al., 2004; Insaidoo et al., 2011). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, it has not been determined if the salt bridges in some MHC I molecules impact TCR recognition through a direct interaction with the TCR or indirectly through modulation of the peptide conformation.",

Three different interactions contribute to the formation of the salt bridges: 1) the electrostatic interaction between R62 or R66 in the \u03b11 helix and the E163 in the \u03b12 helix. The hydrogen bonds constructed between residues R66 and E163 in H-2Kd and between R62 and E163 in HLA-B*4001 are 2.59 \u00c5 and 2.75 \u00c5, respectively. 2) R62 or R66 in the salt bridge can form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the P2 residue of the bound peptide in the PBG (as in both the H-2Kd and HLA-B*4001 structures, and through a water molecule in Mamu-A*02). 3) For the MHC I-binding peptides with a hydrophilic residue at the P1 position, hydrogen bonds can be found between E163 and the side chains of the P1 residue of the peptide (as in the H-2Kd structure but not HLA-B*4001) (Fig. 4). In HLA-B*4002 and HLA-B*0702, a water molecule links the interaction between R66 and E163 (Fig. 4).

Compared to the structure of MHC I with the R62-E163 salt bridge, the \u03b12-helix of MHC I molecules with the R66-E163 salt bridge has an conformational shift (approximately 1.65 \u00c5 between H-2Kd and HLA-B*4001), using the \u03b11-helix of MHC I as the benchmark during the alignment (Fig. 5B). The peptides in the structures of MHC I complexes with R66-E163 salt bridges also display conformational differences for the two residues at the P1 and P2 positions compared to the peptides under the R62-E163 salt bridges (Fig. 5C). The C\u03b1 of the P2 residues in the H-2Kd-binding peptides are closer to the C-terminus of the PBG and located lower and closer to the bottom of the groove (Fig. 5D and 5E).

The impact on the thermostability of HLA-B*4001 by the mutants was not as much as that observed in the H-2Kd mutants. This is may be due to the intrinsic features of different salt bridges in the two molecules. Using structural analysis, we found that the enhancement effect of peptide binding to MHC I was not only contributed by the direct formation of the salt bridge above the peptide main chain but also contributed by the conserved hydrogen bonds between the salt bridge-forming residues with the atoms on the main chain and the P1 residues of the peptides. A previous study indicates that a salt bridge (also called an ion pair in the study) formed by Arg\u03b180 and Asp\u03b257 in MHC class II heterodimers is also critical for surface expression and peptide presentation (Nalefski et al., 1995). However, unlike the salt bridge overhanging the MHC I peptide, this Arg\u03b180-Asp\u03b257 salt bridge is located under the main chain of the MHC II-presented peptide and may contribute to P9 binding and the C-terminal hanging conformation of the MHC II-bound peptides.",

Birkinshaw et al. studied that a prototypical autoreactive BK6 TCR bound CD1a when the presented ligands were permissive. TCR docked over the A\u2019 roof of CD1a and a central CD1a salt-bridge network (Arg76-Glu154 salt-bridge) prevented the interaction between BK6 TCR and permissive ligands, and its autoreactivity was determined by contacts with CD1a. Nonpermissive ligands disrupted salt bridge interaction of CD1a, disrupt the properties of A\u2019 roof and could hinder engagement of hydrophobic CDR3\u03b2 loop of the BK6 TCR with CD1a (Birkinshaw et al., 2015). Nurzia et al. indicate that the positive charging of Arg62 is preferred for the TCR recognition of Ankylosing Spondylitis-associated B*2705 complexes, as revealed by the R62 K and R62A mutants with an overall reduced capability to present peptides to CD8+ T-cells (Nurzia et al., 2012). Our data also demonstrate that T-cell recognition was significantly alleviated when we broke the MHC I salt bridge with R66A and E163A mutations. Previously determined complex structure between HLA-B*07:02 and KFJ37 TCR showed that both the R62 and E163 of HLA-B*07:02 can form hydrogen bonds with the residues in the CDR3\u03b1 and CDR1\u03b1 loops of the TCR, respectively (Chan et al., 2018). This indicated that the residues in the salt bridge can be directly-recognized by the TCR (Tynan et al., 2007). Meanwhile, our analysis also demonstrated that the salt bridge can lead to a conformational shift of the presented peptide and the relative locations of the \u03b11 or \u03b12 helices, which may subsequently and indirectly impact TCR recognition. Further structural studies are required to investigate the accurate and detailed recognition of MHC I/peptide complex containing the salt bridge by the TCR.",
