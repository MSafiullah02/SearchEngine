These opportunities often occur when the preferred habitat of a species overlaps or is invaded by a second species. Interspecies interactions, especially among species competitively utilizing the same resources, often result in aggressive encounters. If a pathogen is present in a reservoir host, the encounter may result in pathogen transmission to a naive host or adaptation of the pathogen to create a new reservoir. The reservoir population, the carrier of the pathogen and the long-term host, often does not exhibit disease symptoms or experience any additional mortality.",

Our goal is to model the process of interspecies pathogen transmission based on species habitat preferences. The motivation for the models comes from our recent study of hantavirus in Paraguay. Hantavirus (Family Bunyaviridae) is a genus of viruses, each generally associated with a specific rodent species (i.e., mice and rats). Approximately 30 different hantaviruses exist throughout the world, some of which cause human infection (Mills et al., 1999). Human infection is incidental, generally due to indirect transmission from contact with infectious rodent excreta, but may result in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with a mortality rate as high as 37% (CDC, 2002). One of the reservoir species for hantavirus in Paraguay is Akodon montensis (Montane Akodont found in Eastern Paraguay, Northeastern Argentina and Southeastern Brazil) carrier of Jabora virus (JABV, GenBank # EF492471). Our empirical data show that although these species exhibit different habitat preferences, the combination of partial habitat flexibility and temporally variable climatic and soil and vegetation conditions, results in periodic microgeographic sympatry of Akodon with one or both of the spillover species.",

A multi-species epizootic model for susceptible and infected hosts was formulated and analyzed by McCormack and Allen (2007) but this model was not spatially explicit and did not account for differences in epizootiology of reservoir and spillover species. Our new models take into account habitat partitioning and important differences in the epizootiology of the reservoir and spillover populations. The role of the spillover species in pathogen and disease emergence is not well understood. It has been speculated that the spillover species may contribute to maintenance of the pathogen in the wild, provided there is spillback infection (McCormack and Allen, 2007) or the spillover species may be instrumental in the evolution of new hantaviruses (Chu et al., 2006). Spillover infections occur in hantavirus (Delfraro et al., 2008, Palma et al., 2009, Klingstrom et al., 2002; Torrez-Martinez et al., 1998, Weidmann et al., 2005) but are not unique to hantaviruses (Daszak et al., 2000); they have been documented in other zoonotic diseases including rabies (Nadin-Davis and Loza-Rubio, 2006; Nel et al., 1997), Nipah virus (Chua, 2003), canine distemper, parvovirus (Fiorello et al., 2006), and the SARS coronavirus (Holmes, 2003).",

            "text": "The habitat-based models consist of three regions: a preferred habitat for each of the reservoir and the spillover populations, and a third region of overlap (or boundary region) where interspecies encounters and pathogen transmission may occur. We formulate two models, the first model is a deterministic model, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE), whereas the second model is a stochastic model, a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model. The ODE system is analytically tractable in the case that encounters in the boundary region are brief. In this case an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, R0, can be calculated, the threshold for disease outbreaks. The basic reproduction number is one of the most important parameters in the study of disease ecology. Specifically, it is the number of secondary infections caused by introduction of one infectious individual into an entirely susceptible population (see Anderson and May, 1991, Hethcote, 2000). The ODE system does not capture the few cases that occur due to interspecies interactions in the region of overlap. Therefore, we formulate a CTMC model for this purpose. Numerical solutions of the stochastic model illustrate sporadic infection in the spillover species when habitats overlap, a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Analysis and simulation of our new models show that as the number of encounters in the overlap region and the time spent in the overlap region increase (which may be triggered by habitat change), there is greater likelihood of pathogen outbreaks and disease persistence in the reservoir and spillover populations (through increase in R0). Interspecies encounters and pathogen transmission in the region of overlap may be the first step in the evolution of a new hantavirus strain.",

Site R3A is largely deforested, with its natural cover replaced by native and exotic graminoids and forbs. This site is highly disturbed by human activities and is intensively managed for pasturing and grazing. Reforestation is suppressed and graminoid cover maintained by frequent prescribed burning. Large ungulate grazers, primarily domestic cattle (Bos taurus) are present on this site year-round. Vegetation in the site is dominated by species of the genus Andropogon, warm temperature/tropical grasses used as grazing forage. Other common vegetation genera include Merostachys (bamboo) along the fringes of pastures and Xyris (a forb) in lower, wetter areas. Although dominated by herbaceous species, R3A retains a few islands of woody vegetation and trees, especially along the edges of the deforested areas. These forest remnants are better microhabitats for Akodon, and most captures of this species were along the northwest and southeast corners of the grid, the edges closest to the woodlands.",

Although native cover remains, the site shows evidence of recent human disturbance, especially selective logging and nearby road construction. These disturbances have resulted in fragmentation of the native vegetation cover, producing numerous internal edges and gaps in the forest canopy. These edges and gaps are associated with a dense understory at the forest floor, favorable habitat for A. montensis (Pardi\u00f1as and D\u2019El\u00eda, 2003). Dominant vegetation genera in areas of intact or mostly intact forest include Cedrela and Balfourodendron. In disturbed areas, a lower canopy dominated by Sorocea bonplandii (a lower, woody shrub-like tree) is common, with herbaceous species and Bromelia common in the understory, and Merostachys frequently in forest gaps.",

However, although A. montensis is preferentially a forest-dweller, it only rarely climbs in the vegetation (651 of 661, 98.5%, of our captures of this species on R3B were on the ground). Both grids were sampled in nine sessions from February 2005 to May 2007, using standard mark-recapture techniques for small mammals (Wilson et al., 1996). Each session included eight consecutive nights (seven in February 2005). Animals were individually marked with a subdermally- implanted passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag, which can be read by passing the electronic reader near the animal's body. Date, grid, trap station, and the PIT tag number were recorded, animals were identified to species, and sex and weight were recorded. Blood, saliva, urine, and feces were collected the first time an animal was captured during each sampling session, for assay of hantavirus antibody and viral RNA presence. Animals were then released at the site of capture. All field protocols were approved by the Texas Tech University Animal Care and Use Committee.",

In this report we consider only the populations of A. montensis, N. lasiurus, and O. delator, as exemplifying the scenario being modeled. A. montensis has been described as the primary reservoir of JABV. RNA-positive individuals of Akodon were encountered on R3B and R3A, and seropositive individuals of N. lasiurus and O. delator were trapped and identified on R3A. Each of these species is widely distributed in the central Southern Cone of South America (Carleton and Musser, 2005), and may be locally abundant in their preferred habitat. Habitat preferences differ somewhat among the three, which is critical to this field situation and to the model which we present herein. N. lasiurus and O. delator prefer grasslands, with Necromys preferring dry soil and Oxymycterus preferring wet or even saturated soils. A. montensis preferentially inhabits disturbed woodlands, also venturing into old-fields and grasslands which include forbs and brushy growth (Redford and Eisenberg, 1992, Goodin et al., manuscript). Our data from nine sampling sessions through 27 months support these descriptions of habitat preferences, and further indicate that the microgeographic separation among these three species is partial and temporally variable and often incomplete, with overlap (microsympatry) occurring sporadically between A. montensis and one or both of the spillover species. Fig. 2\nillustrates this situation on site R3A, and also indicates the presence of seropositive individuals for each of these species in close proximity to the others.",

The subscript r refers to the reservoir species. The total population density is Nr=Sr+Er+Ir+Pr. The per capita birth rate and survival to the adult reproductive stage is br. There is no vertical transmission. Disease-related deaths are not known to occur in the reservoir host (Mills et al., 1997). The natural death rate depends on population density, a strictly increasing function of the population density, 0\u2264dr(0)<br and limNr\u2192\u221edr(Nr)>br. The transmission coefficients for the two infectious stages are \u03b2I and \u03b2P, respectively. The models described below assume density-dependent transmission (pseudo-mass action incidence) as in other hantavirus models (Abramson and Kenkre, 2002; Abramson et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2006a, Allen et al., 2006b). The models and results can be easily generalized to frequency-dependent transmission which in some cases may provide a better fit to data (Begon et al., 1999). In stable environments, frequency-dependent transmission may be appropriate, but in the overlap region, where rodents occupy the region for only a short period of time, encounters are most likely density-dependent. The average length of the exposed and highly infectious periods are 1/\u03b4r and 1/\u03b3r, respectively. All parameters are assumed to be positive unless noted otherwise. The model for the reservoir population takes the following form:(3.1)dSrdt=brNr-Sr(\u03b2IIr+\u03b2PPr)-Srdr(Nr),dErdt=Sr(\u03b2IIr+\u03b2PPr)-\u03b4rEr-Erdr(Nr),dIrdt=\u03b4rEr-\u03b3rIr-Irdr(Nr),dPrdt=\u03b3rIr-Prdr(Nr).The total population density satisfies the following differential equation:(3.2)dNrdt=Nr[br-dr(Nr)].From the assumptions on dr, it follows that there exists a unique positive constant Kr, the carrying capacity, such that br=dr(Kr) and limt\u2192\u221eNr(t)=Kr. With frequency-dependent transmission the terms Sr(\u03b2IIr+\u03b2PPr) are replaced with Sr(\u03b2IIr+\u03b2PPr)/Nr.",

An inherent assumption in the models is that the time spent in each of the disease states is exponentially distributed. For example, the probability that an initially exposed reservoir host transitions to the infectious stage while in the boundary region is(3.7)\u222b0\u221epoexp(-pot)\u222b0t\u03b4aexp(-\u03b4as)dsdt=\u03b4apo+\u03b4a.Other models based on more general probability distributions such as the gamma distribution provide alternative formulations (Feng et al., 2007; Lloyd, 2001a, Lloyd, 2001b). More data are required to determine the form of the distributions. In this investigation, we consider the simplest form, an exponential distribution. If po\u2aa2maxi\u2208{a,b}{\u03b4i,\u03b3i} and if the number of rodents exposed to the infection in the boundary region is relatively small, then transitions between disease stages in the boundary region may have little impact on the disease dynamics.

For example, A. montensis is seen in the overlap region more frequently in period T than in periods D or W, when densities of O. delator are high.

It can be easily shown that the extinction equilibrium is unstable; the population persists. For example, it follows from Eqs.

As the ratio pi/po increases, so do the population densities in the boundary region, whereas the densities in the preferred habitats will approach their respective carrying capacities.

The reservoir species A. montensis and one spillover species (N. lasiurus) are widely distributed in many of our study sites sampled in Paraguay, whereas the other spillover species (O. delator) is less widespread and generally less abundant. We choose carrying capacities of Kr=100 and Ks=50 for the reservoir and spillover species in their respective habitats. Although the values for Kr and Ks are not known, the selected values are close to the estimates for minimal number known alive based on data from the trapping regions. The basic time unit in the model is one year. We assume total number of births per female per year that survive to the adult reproductive stage is six for the reservoir and the spillover species (several litters per year). Assuming an equal sex ratio, for the male population the number of males that survive to reproductive age is br=3=bs. Population growth is assumed to satisfy a logistic growth assumption so that for the reservoir and spillover species, dr(Nr)=brNr/Krandds(Ns)=bsNs/Ks,so that dr(Kr)=br and ds(Ks)=bs. We assume an average duration of two weeks for the latent period E and for the spillover infectious stage A, and an average duration of three months for the highly infectious stage for the reservoir species (Bernshtein et al., 1999, Lee et al., 1981, Padula et al., 2004). Hence, \u03b4r=26=\u03b4s, \u03b3s=26, and \u03b3r=4, e.g., 1/26year\u2248two weeks. In addition, \u03b4a=\u03b4r, \u03b4b=\u03b4s, \u03b3a=\u03b3r, and \u03b3b=\u03b3s.

In the numerical examples, we let pi=8 and po=52 which means, on average, each animal may make eight visits per year to the boundary region, spending about one week in the boundary region. The probability there is a transition from an exposed to an infectious state while in the boundary region is 1/3 (see Eq. (3.7)). Even though this probability is not small, the basic reproduction number given by (4.4) is a good approximation to the overall basic reproduction number for our parameter values (shown below). The parameter values are reasonable but are chosen for illustrative purposes (a range of values, pi\u2208[2,25] and po\u2208[26,364], are considered later in this section). These parameter choices give population densities in the boundary region of Ka\u224815 and Kb\u22488.",

Based on the summary data for proportion of animals RNA- or antibody-positive, 0.25 at site R3B, if we equate formula (4.3) to 0.25 and let br=3 and \u03b4r=26, this leads to Rr=1.39 (when pi=0=po). Thus, the value of \u03b2I is chosen so that R0r (which is close to Rr) is between one and two. We assume that the highly infectious stage of the reservoir host (RNA-positive and/or antibody-positive) is three times as infectious as the persistently infectious stage (only antibody-positive), i.e., \u03b2I=3\u03b2P (Bernshtein et al., 1999, Lee et al., 1981, Padula et al., 2004).

The models are based on the fact that spatial overlap of habitats leads to greater numbers of interspecies encounters. From the ODE model, an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 was calculated based on assumption (4.1), as well as reproduction numbers for the preferred habitats, R0r and R0s, and for crossover or interspecies transmission, R0c. In this case, we showed global stability of the disease-free equilibrium when R0<1 and existence of an enzootic equilibrium when R0>1. Greater number of interactions among species allow the pathogen to be transmitted more frequently from an infectious host to a susceptible host. This, in turn, increases R0 so that it exceeds the reproduction number in the preferred habitat, R0>Rr (Fig. 7), which ultimately results in greater likelihood of outbreaks and disease persistence. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the overlap region is spatially- and temporally-dependent. We did not consider temporal variability of this overlap region which may depend on seasonal variations. But we did include demographic variability due to births, deaths, transmission, and movement in the CTMC model. Seasonal variations, in general, will cause additional variability in the solution behavior (e.g., Allen et al., 2006a). As more data are collected, the effects of seasonal and climatic variations on the reservoir and spillover species will be studied. In addition, controlled studies are needed to obtain data on the duration and shape of the rodents\u2019 disease stage distributions.",
