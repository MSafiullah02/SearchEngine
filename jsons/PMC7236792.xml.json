Patients presenting more severe clinical manifestations demonstrated comorbidities such as hypertension (58%), heart disease (25%) and arrhythmia (44%) [1,8]. Overall, patients with cardiovascular disease represent more than 20% of all fatal cases, with a case fatality rate of 10.5% [12]. On the other hand, cardiovascular manifestations, during COVID-19, are mostly represented by acute cardiac injury (ACI), defined as a significant elevation of cardiac troponins in up to 12% of patients and arrhythmia in nearly 17% of patients. The potential long-term consequences on the cardiovascular system of patients who recover from this disease are not yet known, but the importance of the effect of COVID-19 infection on the cardiovascular system is also reflected through the elevation of high-sensitivity troponin I levels, novel ECG and echocardiogram abnormalities that can be evaluated during ACI [8,14,15].",

ACE2 is pivotal in physiologic neurohumoral regulation of the cardiovascular system and has an important role in cardiovascular disease. The binding of 2019-nCov to ACE2 may affect ACE2 signaling pathways, leading to ACI. Specifically, a patients susceptibility to 2019-nCov may depend on a higher expression of ACE2, that has been found in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [15,16]. In fact, ACE2 can also be found in the media of diseased blood vessels as well as in angiogenic vessels, indicating a possible role in blood vessel remodeling and therefore this may be involved in atherogenesis and in other pathological vessel conditions [18]. In fact, elevated plasma ACE2 activity is an independent predictor of major cardiac events [19], correlating with cardiovascular disease development [20] and ACE2 was also found in carotid atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm [21,22]",

For example, patients with cardiovascular disease, especially those related to atherosclerosis, offer the 2019-nCov virus a fertile ground to initiate and progress infection of the host. In this context, cardiovascular patients represent the most fragile part of the population, as these patients are more susceptible to 2019-nCov infection and its dreadful complications. ACE2 related mechanism, MP control systems and cytokine levels are often dysregulated in cardiovascular disease [15,16,23]. Moreover, mechanisms related to ACE regulations and inflammation are complex and closely related [23,24].",

However, it is not clear enough at this time whether ACE2 expression necessarily correlates with the severity of 2019-nCov infection. Therefore, at the moment, it is not advisable to stop renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system intake as, it may even increase the overall risk of cardiovascular mortality [25]. For venous thromboembolism, anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin is also associated with decreased mortality, especially in severe clinical manifestations of the 2019-nCov infection [26].",
