Here we propose an integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region and importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic ( , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI 0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security, this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates, suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for increased alertness in highrisk areas worldwide.",

The reproductive number, i.e. the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case, is a key summary measure of the transmissibility of an emerging infection. A first estimation of the MERS-CoV reproductive number was based on the analysis of cluster-size data with assumed cluster partition in terms of transmission trees, highlighting the similarity of current MERS-CoV situation to the prepandemic stage of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [9] . Next to transmissibility, an additional important aspect characterizing the epidemic remains unknown, i.e. the incidence of infection. Observed cases may indeed only represent a proportion of the current epidemic, with a majority of infections going undetected because of mild illness or asymptomatic infection. This aspect also has further relevant implications for the correct estimation of other important overall statistics (e.g. the severity of the virus) and of the risk of importation of cases in other regions of the world. Limited data may also hide important changes in the virus transmissibility related, e.g., to viral adaptations to humans that may alter its pandemic potential, thus presenting an additional challenge for the situation assessment.",

Since evidence for mild illness, as well as for a wide spectrum of clinical disease, was observed [3, 6] , our findings are compatible with an underascertainment rate for zoonotic/environmental transmissions that may be due to a selection bias towards more severe cases, where patients having mild illnesses or asymptomatic infections may go undetected [22] .",

Other events that are related to human movements and mixing may as well alter the assessed scenario. Vast international mass gatherings to be taking place in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the upcoming months are expected to bring large number of pilgrims to the affected area, with increased rates of local mixing that may favor the transmission of the virus, followed by a potential amplification of its international dissemination due to the return of pilgrims to their own countries [24] . It should be noted however that the Hajj 2012 occurred with an ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak in the ME region, and that MERS-CoV was absent among French pilgrims screened prior to returning to France after their participation to the pilgrimage [25] . Similarly, no increase in case notification occurred following the Umra pilgrimage in July 2013.

Epidemiological parameters for the compartmental model were based on the estimates obtained from the analysis of the outbreak data including 22 cases at a health-care facility in Al-Ahsa in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [6], namely average latency period of 5.2 days and generation time of 7.6 days. The daily rate of sporadic cases emergence in the ME region and the reproductive number are the free parameters of the model. For each set of values of these two parameters, GLEAM allows the generation of stochastic numerical realizations of the MERS-CoV outbreak simulating the local epidemic in the source region and the possibility of international dissemination through mobility processes entirely based on real data. We thus generate with a Monte Carlo procedure the probability distribution ( ) of the number of imported MERS-CoV cases in country out of the seed region as of August 31, 2013 ( stochastic realizations for each point ( ) of the space of parameters). Being all independent importation events, we can define a likelihood function ( { }) \u220f ( ) , where is the empirically observed number of imported cases per country (see schematic example in Figure 1). We further restrict our analysis to countries of Western Europe, to focus on a region where respiratory diseases surveillance is homogeneous and with a high sensitivity to detect importations. These data consisted therefore in: in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy, and for all other countries in the Western European region (Figure 1). We estimated the log-likelihood over a bi-dimensional grid of ( ) values and used bivariate linear interpolation over a refined grid. Given the unknown geographical extension of the source of the MERS-CoV infection in the ME region and its reservoir, we performed a sensitivity analysis by considering: (i) an extended definition of source region to neighboring countries, thus additionally including Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestinian territories, Syria, and Yemen (extended source region), based on travel recommendations [20]; (ii) a restricted source region localized only in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, i.e. the country in the ME region that reported the largest number of cases; (iii) a variation in the time of the initial emergence of the virus with transmission to humans, assuming that sporadic cases may be introduced up to two months before the known initial cases (Jordan cluster, April 2012 [4]), to allow for lack of identification or detection prior to the Jordan cluster.Integrative approach combining Methods 1 Methods was used to measure distance from the best fit.",

The corresponding best estimate for uncertainty in the cluster distribution suggests a consistent fraction of cases missed in cluster investigations ( =0.35, 95% CI 0-0.85), but little impact of inaccuracies in reported cluster size on the estimates of the other parameters. The estimated daily rate of sporadic cases in the ME region can be compared to the observed value ( ), computed based on 60 sporadic cases reported between April 2012 and August 31, 2013 in the region, including 43 sporadic cases and 13 cluster index cases in the ME region (assuming that each cluster is originated by a single index case), as well as 4 laboratoryconfirmed imported cases out of the region [1,3,5]. This yields that the true number of cases from zoonotic/environmental transmission might be between 1.03-and 7.32-fold the observed number. Our estimates are very robust against the addition of cases out of the ME region to the distribution of clusters sizes ( 0.50, 0.31-0.77; no change for ). An increase in , though with limited change in the associated confidence interval, is obtained if we include the full Jordan cluster of April 2012 by considering also cases retrospectively confirmed by serology ( 0.65, 0.34-0.80); no variations are obtained in the confidence interval of the estimated daily rate of sporadic cases in the region (Table 2). Similar results for the reproductive number are obtained when we consider variations in the geographic definition of the MERS-CoV source region. Extending it to its neighboring countries does not affect the estimated basic reproductive number and associated confidence interval ( 0.50, 0.31-0.76), but lowers the value of the daily rate of sporadic cases ( 0.14, 0.05-0.38). If we assume that the source region is instead restricted to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a substantial increase in is obtained (4.73, 2.32-15.37), with increase in the reproductive number and unaltered confidence interval ( 0.60, 0.30-0.76). No variation in was observed in testing a different hypothesis on the offspring distribution, whereas an increase for the best estimate of was found (0.69 in the Poisson case vs. 0.50 in the baseline, with similar CIs,",

            "text": "In absence of any knowledge about the virus path of infection to humans and with insufficient data from epidemiological investigations to reliably reconstruct transmission trees within clusters, we chose a worst-case assumption for the transmissibility of the virus. This may lead to overestimating the reproductive number, however not affecting our conclusion on the subcritical nature of the current MERS-CoV epidemic. In addition, such assumption does not affect our analysis based on case importations (Method 2) that aims to estimate the size of the epidemic in the affected region, in that it assumes no knowledge on the local transmissions, independently of their type (whether human-to-human or zoonotic/environmental).We considered the cluster analysis (Method 1) restricted to the ME region as we assumed a rather homogeneous implementation of control measures around cases that may be different from the one put in place in affected countries experiencing importation of cases, mainly due to the additional available knowledge of travel history associated to imported cases. The extension of the analysis to all MERS-CoV clusters of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO did not alter our estimates.The spatial component of our approach represents another difference with previous work. If we assume that the source of MERS-CoV infection is restricted to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where the majority of cases has been observed, our estimates indicate that a much larger number of sporadic cases in the area would be needed to sustain the observed importation ofcases in Western Europe (4.73 daily introductions of sporadic cases vs. 0.28 in the baseline). The biggest airports, handling the vast majority of the international air traffic of the region, are indeed mainly localized in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Jordan (panel A of Figure 3). This strongly reduces the traffic capacity of the ME region, as well as the corresponding likelihood of exporting cases out of the region, once the restricted hypothesis on the seeding area is considered. An analysis based on cluster data only would remain unchanged and would not be able to detect important variations in the epidemic size estimation. This result further indicates the relevance of air travel in the epidemic assessment and therefore the need for an integrative approach also based on mobility and space. It also implies that improving the knowledge of the geographic extent of the seed region is critical, along with the identification of the virus' path of transmission to humans. Changes in time of countries' public health actions for surveillance and control of the MERS-CoV epidemic certainly occurred in response to the increasingly available emerging evidence and the higher awareness of the disease, however data is too scarce to provide estimates of the reproductive number ( ) as a function of time. Here we assumed a constant for the period under study, with the underlying assumption of a constant and homogeneous implementation of intervention measures in the region. Other possible factors leading to variations of the current situation may be pathogen-and hostsrelated. Evolution of the MERS-CoV virus to adapt to humans and reach sustainable and efficient human-to-human transmission represents a potential future scenario, as it happened for SARS [23]. We tested for possible variations of and estimates by comparing two different points in time (end of May and end of August 2013) and found no significant change, except for a reduction of the CIs following a larger dataset available for the estimation. Given the available data, this result seems to indicate that no variation in the rate of introductions and in the transmissibility of the virus has occurred in the last 3 months that may point to differences in the transmission to humans or to viral adaptations to human hosts. On the other hand, if compared to the reported number of sporadic cases at the two dates, our estimates are in favor of an increase in sporadic case ascertainment as the estimated underascertainment rate has decreased in this time period from 2.2-17.5 considering notified laboratory-confirmed cases up to May 31 to 1.03-7.32 up to August 31. Further data to update the integrative approach will contribute to provide a continuous assessment of the outbreak in case an evolving situation is suspected.",
