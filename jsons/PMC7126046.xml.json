            "text": "Unlike bacteria-based infection which can be controlled by antibiotics, viruses fully relying on host cells for their replication are not so readily dealt with. The emergence and spread of viral diseases worldwide, particularly HIV/AIDS, outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and the scares of pandemic avian influenza virus seriously raise the concern that any virus strain has the potential evolving into a life-threatening pathogen. In this regard, developing fast and efficient screening technology has its merits of identifying potential drugs against viral diseases that still lack of effective prevention or treatment. Dengue virus is the typical one representing an important emerging mosquito borne disease worldwide. It has spread from being endemic in just 9 countries in 1970 to 100 countries in 2002, according to the world health report (http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en). Apparently, global population growth, urbanization, and frequent modern transportation have contributed to the increased incidence and geographic spread of dengue viruses. These diseases occur in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, where 2.5 billion people are estimated at risk for dengue virus outbreaks (Gubler and Clark, 1995). Each year, tens of millions of cases of dengue fever occur, particularly in Asia, Africa, South America, and Pacific. The fatality rate is about 5% and there is no vaccine available for dengue virus. Control of the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, is the only method currently employed to prevent dengue virus epidemics.",

            "text": "The pace of exploiting antiviral agents could be expedited by the availability of quick and efficient high-throughput anti-dengue viral agent screening assays. Recently, a cell-based immunofluorescence imaging technology has been developed to identify potential anti-dengue viral therapeutic agents (Chu and Yang, 2007). They reported that inhibitors of the c-Src protein kinase hinder the assembly of dengue virions and may therefore be an effective therapy. It was anticipated that the new assay can be useful for identifying small molecule inhibitors of dengue virus infection and replication as well as improving understanding of dengue virus\u2013host interaction. Although the developed assay has its merits, the process of screening antiviral agents was not quick enough because the Vero cell culture plate after the addition of dengue virus and then specific protein kinase inhibitor has to be incubated for 3 days prior to the performance of immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, anti-dengue E protein monoclonal antibody and the secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent dye FITC have to be used for labeling the cell monolayer. This is no doubt a time-consuming and expensive process. Fluorescent dye has been widely used for viral labeling experiments and improved our understanding of viral infection process. However, fluorophores are notorious for photobleaching and spectral overlaps, and therefore could affect the fluorescence imaging quality of dye-labeled virus since the observation time ranged from one to ten seconds before photobleach occurs. Obviously, a high fluorescence quantum yield and a large number of fluorescent photocycles before photobleach of the dye molecule occurs are the prerequisites for successfully detecting dye-labeled viral particles. Moreover, after labeling viral particles with fluorescent dyes, the number of viruses that can infect a cell most likely will be severely diminished.",

Thanks to excellent photostability, broad adsorption spectra, and narrow emission spectra, QDs have attracted great interests in many areas of research, from molecular and cellular biology to molecular imaging and medical diagnostics (Michalet et al., 2005 and references therein). Tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO)-coated QD suspended in organic solvent was first converted into water-soluble QD employing synthesized amphiphilic alginate surfactants. Complexes between QDs and dengue virus, both possessing a net negative surface charge, will be formed by colloidal clustering, facilitated by positively charged polycationic compound \u2013 polybrene. In order to test if QD\u2013virus complexes can be harnessed as diagnostic probes for fast screening potential anti-dengue viral drug candidates, allophycocyanin (protein-bound pigment) purified from a blue-green microalga Spirulina platensis was used as the model agent since it has been reported to exhibit anti-EV71 activities (Shih et al., 2003). Our results showed that the intensity of green QD images within BHK-21 cells was decreased along with the dosage increase of allophycocyanin up to 125 \u03bcg/mL provided one hour prior to the addition of QD\u2013virus complexes. It was clearly illustrated that allophycocyanin possesses anti-dengue viral activity and this can be determined within half an hour after target cells incubated with dengue viruses incorporated with amphiphilic alginate coated QD in the presence of 50 \u03bcg/mL polybrene.",

After the formation of a CdO\u2013HDA complex as indicated by the change of color from reddish to colorless, the temperature of the solution was cooled down to 260 \u00b0C and waited for injection. A stock solution with 31.58 mg of selenium powder (Se, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) dissolved in 5 mL of tri-n-butylphosphine (TBP, Showa, Japan) was quickly injected into the solution under rigorous stirring to nucleate CdSe nanocrystals. After injection, the core solution was grown at 260 \u00b0C for approximately 5 s when the color of the mixture turned from colorless to slightly red. The temperature was then cooled to 200 \u00b0C for shell growth. The shell solution containing 379.4 mg zinc stearate (J.T.

After addition of shell solution, the core-shell solution was cooled down to 120 \u00b0C to anneal for 2 h. The core-shell solution was cooled to room temperature afterwards.

            "text": "Colloidal nanocrystal QDs consisting of an inorganic core/shell structure (e.g., CdSe/ZnS) surrounded by a layer of organic ligands (i.e., TOPO) can be converted into hydrophilic nanoparticles by several approaches (Bruchez et al., 1998, Chan and Nie, 1998, Dubertret et al., 2002, Mulder et al., 2006, Pinaud et al., 2004; Zhelev et al., 2006). The commonly used strategy is based on the exchange of the original organic layer with hydrophilic ligands, however the physical properties (i.e., quantum yield) are usually deteriorated through such surface modification. In this study, we demonstrated the first time that amphiphilic alginate can encapsulate CdSe/ZnS by intercalating alginate surfactant's hydrophobic pendant moieties (i.e., octyl chains) into the hydrophobic surfactant layer (i.e., TOPO) on the QD surface, thereby resulting in the phase transfer of hydrophobic QDs from organic solvents to aqueous solution via hydrophilic backbone (i.e., alginate). The schematic drawing of the water-soluble CdSe/ZnS QDs encapsulated with amphiphilic alginate is shown in Fig. 1(a). The average size of water-soluble QDs encapsulated by alginate surfactants was determined to be 23.1 nm in the range of 18.1\u201328.7 nm shown in Fig. 1(b). As long as the number of pendant groups is sufficiently high, the linkage of amphiphilic alginate to the QD surface could be very stable and thereby lead to the physical properties of QD intact. The absorption and emission spectra of QD encapsulated with amphiphilic alginate given in Fig. 2(a) reveal higher absorbance between 525 and 550 nm and strong photoluminescence with the emission wavelength peaked at 534 nm after excited by UV-light. The inset image in Fig. 2(a) illustrates the bright green color of AA-QD in aqueous solution. To demonstrate the formation of QD\u2013virus complexes via colloidal clustering of negatively charged QD and dengue virus in cationic polybrene solution, TEM image of QD\u2013virus complexes was taken and showed in Fig. 2(b). In the image, the light-color particles with the size around 40\u201350 nm are dengue virus, and the dark-color particles tagged on the surface of viral particles are AA-QDs (about 10\u201315 nm).",

In Fig. 3(a)\u2013(b), when the AA-QDs (zeta potential measurement of \u22127.18 mV) added in cell culture dish without polybrene respectively for 30 and 60 min, AA-QDs were not detected under fluorescent microscopy after remained AA-QDs was washed off with PBS. This is due to electrical repulsion between alginate macromolecule and cell surface which are both negatively charged. However, after 120 min co-culture of AA-QDs and cells without the addition of polybrene, green dots representing QDs were able to be pinpointed within cellular domain (Fig. 3(c)). It is surmised that, given a longer incubation time (i.e., 120 min), sufficient amount of proteins (ingredients from fetal bovine serum) adsorbed onto the surface of negatively charged AA-QDs triggered nonspecific cell binding and ensuing endocytosis. While, in Fig. 3(d)\u2013(f), AA-QDs were started to be detected in the intracellular space 60 min post-incubation, in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/mL polybrene. This is probably because the electrostatic neutralization effect of polycationic polybrene led to nonspecific adsorption of negatively charged AA-QDs on negatively charged cell membrane. It is noteworthy that polybrene is a cationic polymer and has been reported to act by neutralizing negative charges on the surface of cells and virions to promote virus attachment and enhance viral transduction rate (Kwon and Peng, 2002). Once the concentration of polybrene increased to 50 \u03bcg/mL, AA-QDs were able to enter the cell ports within a short period of time and expressed green fluorescence in BHK-21 cells after 30 min of treatment.",

            "text": "The QDs encapsulated with amphiphilic alignate surfactants were employed to form colloidal clusters with dengue viruses (zeta potential measurement of \u22126.04 mV) in the presence of cationic polybrene. To determine the suitable viral concentration for the development of quick and efficient cell-based fluorescent imaging drug screening platform, various MOIs (multiplicity of infection) were employed ranging from 0.1 to 1. Our results showed that QD\u2013virus complexes with a net positive charge (zeta potential measurement of +2.84 mV) were internalized into BHK-21 cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and can be detected in cellular milieu. As shown in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(f), green fluorescent intensity expressed within BHK-21 cells due to the entrance of QD\u2013virus was augmented in proportion to the increment of MOI (from 0.1 to 0.5). To confirm the QD\u2013virus complexes were indeed internalized into BHK-21 cells rather than absorbed on cell surface, a series of photomicrographs taken by a confocal microscope along the z-axis of selected infected cells are shown in Fig. 4(g). The green fluorescence was further enhanced when the concentration of polybrene increased from 10 to 50 \u03bcg/mL with MOI maintained at 0.5 (shown in Fig. 5(a)\u2013(c)). Since preservation of viral infectivity after tagging virus with QDs is of utmost importance for QD\u2013virus imaging modality offering meaningful information, plaque forming assays were performed with BHK-21 cells treated with intact dengue viruses and QD\u2013virus complexes. The result (data not shown) indicated the number of plaque forming units numerated from the cells infected with QD\u2013virus complexes was only slightly lower than the control group (i.e., dengue viruses without QDs tagging). This implies that dengue viral infectivity was retained using the method of incorporation virus with QDs in polycationic solution. This is consistent with the previous report indicating the infectivity of incompetent retrovirus as a viral gene delivery vehicle decreases slightly when mixed with QD in polycationic solution (You et al., 2006). In contrast to viruses covalently labeled with fluorescent dyes, the method developed in this study seems to be a superior one. In the case of adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is a relatively small virus (\u223c25 nm in diameter), it has been shown that for a dye-to-particle ratio higher than two, the infectious titer was severely affected, namely the number of viruses which were able to infect a cell was lowered (Seisenberger et al., 2001). It should be noted that the cell shape of Fig. 5(b) turned into large ones after BHK-21 cells were infected with QD\u2013virus complexes for 60 min. The situation gets even worse for cells treated with QD\u2013virus complexes up to 120 min (see Fig. 5(c)). We speculate such cell morphological changes were caused by the viral damage of cell machinery (e.g., cytoskeleton), thereby leading to cell lysis.",

In many of these methods, viral gene expression is determined after a certain long incubation time. Moreover, most of the methods are very time consuming and a large amount of viruses has to be used. In view of the need of polybrene for neutralizing electrostatic repulsion force between both negatively charged dengue virus and amphiphilic alginate coated QD, it is conjectured that having QDs capped by positively charged water-soluble ligands (or polymers) to directly form complexes with viruses without the aid of polybrene probably is a feasible and much simple method.",

In order to test if QD\u2013virus complexes can be harnessed as diagnostic probes for fast screening potential anti-dengue drugs, allophycocyanin was selected as the model compound for exploring the efficacy of QD\u2013virus imaging modality for screening anti-dengue viral therapeutic agents. Allophycocyanin has been reported to neutralize EV71-induced cytopathic effect in both human rhabdomyosarcoma cells and African green monkey kidney cells. Antiviral activity was more efficient in cultures treated with allophycocyanin before viral infection compared with that in the cultures treated after infection (Shih et al., 2003). As shown in Fig. 6(a)\u2013(d), the intensity of green images within BHK-21 cells was decreased along with the dosage increase of allophycocyanin provided one hour prior to the addition of QD\u2013virus complexes which were constructed in the presence of 50 \u03bcg/mL polybrene. It should be noted that cells incubated with QD\u2013virus complexes for only 30 min can give a fairly clear fluorescent intensity decrease with the concentration of allophyscocyanin up to 125 \u03bcg/mL. For cells treated with allophycocyanin higher or equal to 31.25 \u03bcg/mL for one hour then challenged with QD\u2013virus complexes for 60 min, the diminish of green fluorescence is even astonishing prominent. Compared to other anti-viral agent screening assays, the cell-based QD\u2013virus imaging modality exploited in this study indeed has fast and efficient features for screening antiviral therapeutics. Since, the pI value of allophycocyanin was measured around 4.5, a net negative charge of allophycocyanin will be revealed in the cell culture medium. Such negatively charged allophycocyanin might be associated with positively charged QD\u2013virus complexes if free allophycocyanin remained in the culture medium. However, in our study, BHK-21 cells were only treated with allophycocyanin for 1 h and washed three times with PBS solution. There is no concern of allophycocyanin interference on the interaction between QD\u2013virus complexes and cells.",
