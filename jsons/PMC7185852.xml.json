A new influenza A H3 strain with point mutations in the target sequence of primers and probes of the influenza A1 assay appeared during the course of our work, and our qPCR assay was therefore updated according to the recommendations of the Public Health Agency of Sweden (M. Brytting, unpublished data) to include an assay-denoted influenza A2. Primers and probes for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were already established as uniplex qPCR assays for analysis of spinal fluid at our laboratory but not published before. Primers and probes for S. pyogenes were constructed with the Primer Express version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All probes used the hydrolysis technology with black hole quenchers and fluorophores 6-carboxyfluorescein or VIC (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix for DNA detection and the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix for RNA detection were used for bacteria and viruses, respectively (Applied Biosystems).

Analytical specificity of primers and probes was tested bioinformatically and experimentally with primer BLAST27 and a test panel of 34 reference strains (Supplemental Table S1), respectively. Limit of detection was assessed as recommended,28 by serial dilution of linear plasmid by using six replicates with concentrations of 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, and 0.1 copies per reaction, respectively. The ability of the duplex assay to simultaneously detect both agents targeted was tested by keeping one of the agents at high concentration (104 copies per reaction) while testing for the other agent. For PIV1 and PIV2 equal concentrations were used. The limit of detection was defined as the concentration at which all six replicates were detected, for theoretical reasons five copies per reactions was set as detection limit. An experiment was approved only if zero to one of the six replicates in the 0.1 dilution were positive. Efficiency was tested by dilution series of plasmid standards, ranging from approximately 1 to 105 copies per reaction, with equal concentrations of both targets of the duplex reaction. The analyses were performed in duplicates or triplicates, and detection of at least five dilution steps was required for an approved result. Standard curves were generated by plotting the quantification cycle (Cq) value against 10-logarithm of the concentration. Linearity (R\n2 value) and slope of the standard curve was calculated with the data analysis program SDS version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems). Reproducibility of assays were assessed by comparing positive control results from 26 runs in two separate analysis batches performed >6 months apart by two persons with the use of separate plasmid preparations and dilution series. Relative SD of the Cq values was calculated as a measure of stability. In addition, reproducibility was assessed with clinical specimens spiked with low (n = 5) or high (n = 5) concentration of target DNA or RNA and by using separate qPCR machines in five consecutive runs on three different days. The relative SDs of the Cq values were calculated as a measure of intrarun variability.",

Standard diagnostic work was performed by well-trained clinical laboratory scientists in cooperation with senior consultants in clinical microbiology.

Fifty NpA specimens were consecutively collected between January 2, 2013, and January 18, 2013. Patient median age was 60.5 years (range, 0 to 93 years; n = 50), with male/female distribution of 29/21. Nasopharyngeal swab bacterial culture results were available for 14 specimens, with findings of S. pneumoniae (n = 2), M. catarrhalis (n = 1), and H. influenzae (n = 1). Standard qPCR results were available for influenza A and B in 48 of 50 specimens, for PIV1 to PIV3 in 10 of 50, for C. pneumoniae in 10 of 50, for M. pneumoniae in 10 of 50, and for RSV in 12 of 50. The positive identifications were M. pneumoniae (n = 2), RSV (n = 3), and influenza A (n = 17). No standard diagnostic tests for L. pneumophila were performed.",

Compared with the more traditional strategy of analyzing respiratory specimens for either bacterial or viral causes, the combined approach showed superior detection of agents that are regarded as clinically relevant. Thus, the added value was a combination of the high sensitivity of qPCR assays in general, and, in particular, the fact that infectious agents were detected which were not initially suspected. It was evident that bacteria were detected more often by the qPCR assay than by standard tests as exemplified by the detection of S. pneumoniae in 12 specimens by the former assay but only in five specimens by the standard culture method. The superior performance of the qPCR assay of detecting S. pneumoniae applied to both nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, but especially so for sputum, and, notably, the Cq mean values of the latter were often low, indicating that several culture-negative specimens contained abundant S. pneumoniae-specific nucleic acids. These findings indicate that PCR-based methods may be preferable to culture-based methods for detection of S. pneumoniae in sputum, and this is noteworthy because it is the most important CAP pathogen. Likewise, the qPCR assay was superior for detection of RSV and M. pneumoniae, and in this case it was obvious that the change in the diagnostic approach provided the advantage. The additional detections of RSV and M. pneumoniae were in NpA and sputum specimens, respectively, and occurred at low Cq values, indicating abundant nucleic acids. These two agents were not targeted by the standard tests performed, although they, in retrospect, likely were clinically relevant.",

We believe, however, that the agents selected represent a reasonable compromise of agents that are interesting for inclusion and exclusion purposes at the evaluation of suspected CAP.

Findings of S. aureus by the standard culture method in respiratory specimens are by clinical tradition and experience regarded important only in a few scenarios, for example, in chronic lung disease or with concomitant severe influenza A pneumonitis.
