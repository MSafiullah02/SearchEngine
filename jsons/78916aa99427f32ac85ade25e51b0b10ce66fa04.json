As the disease has spread, many developed and developing countries have been stretched on their resources such as personnel as well as adequate equipment. As a result of resource disparity, in a populous country like India, the elective orthopaedic surgeries stand cancelled whilst trauma and emergency services have been reorganised following Indian Orthopaedic Association and recent urgent British Orthopaedic association guidelines. Though these guidelines provide strategies to deal with trauma and orthopaedic surgery management in the present scenario, once the COVID-19 pandemic stabilizes, restarting elective orthopaedic surgery and managing delayed trauma conditions in evolving health care systems is going to be a profound task. We look at the future challenges and considerations of re-establishing trauma and orthopaedic flow during the post-COVID-19 phase and suggest an algorithm to follow (Figure 1 ).",

Managing trauma and elective surgery in India has been based on strategic recommendations provided by the Indian Orthopaedic Association (IOA) [1] , British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) [2] emergency sub-speciality guidelines and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. However, as and when the pandemic wanes and stabilizes, a surge in orthopaedic patients is expected due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic including situations of trauma conditions which have been managed conservatively along traditional established orthopaedic principles and require a second stage corrective procedure [3] . In India, both the public and private hospitals deliver trauma and orthopaedic services. There is a shortage of orthopaedic surgeons rendering care to people in India [4] with a disproportionate surgeon to patient ratio along with lack of post-operative intensive care bed facilities [3] . However, as we look forward, orthopaedic community and public health systems in India need to consider as to how one can provide the best care for patients in the post-acute stages of COVID-19, patients with trauma who could not have proposed surgery because of non-availability of facilities locally or no possibility of reaching to the higher surgical centres due to national lockdown along with those on current waiting lists for proposed elective orthopaedic surgeries [5, 6] . Currently physiological responses, mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic are still being published in literature [7, 8] .",

These will be continually evolving and the surgeon needs to be frequently in touch with web education and news. [12] . Autonomous government institutions like All India Institute of Medical (AIIMS) will also need a reference document to resume non-emergency surgeries. The MOHFW has and will have an overarching role in regulation of resumption of elective and semi-elective surgery in post-COVID-19 phase in India. They will also have to continually evolve standard operative procedures (SOP) as per feedback from elective surgery patients.",

In India, a delay in the definitive fixation of several fractures is delayed due to several reasons like lack of operation theatre availability, long waiting list in the public hospitals, and other operational reasons [6] . A late (>21 days) or delayed primary operative fixation of displaced fractures is a viable option for cases that presented late, with predictable, favourable results as described in many studies [17] [18] [19] . A delay to primary fixation of up to three months following injury may be acceptable [20] particularly if the outcomes in delayed surgeries are weighed against the risks of surgeries done during active COVID-19 infection and its associated complications.",

Hence with minimal current literature available on complications, a balanced, pragmatic approach may have to be undertaken. Robust pre-operative assessment to evaluate surgical fitness will be necessary with the aim to reduce the risk of postoperative complications with medical evaluation supported by preoperative assessment, detect asymptomatic carriage of COVID-19 and reduce the demand for post-operative intensive care facilities [11, 21] . It is the need of the hour that orthopaedic fraternity considering its high infectivity rates develop a chronological sequence of surgeries-a) surgeries which if not done in a month or so will cause impairment of limb function or make future surgery dangerous.

These complexes must have separate access, the other infrastructure, and a separate exit of its own. Rodrigues-Pinto et al [23] have given a detailed account of the surgical team flow for the orthopaedic surgery in a COVID-19 dedicated operating theatre and divided the complex into five zones: i) Entry dressing room, ii) Anteroom, iii) Operating Room, iv) Exit room, and v) Exit dressing room. These protocols must be followed as far as possible. The orthopaedic operation theatre must have a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter/Laminar flow with high frequency and rapid air changes, to reduce viral contamination. Minimum required number of staff and doctors must present during the surgical procedure inside the operating theatre. The orthopaedic tools and procedures which generate aerosols like drills, reamers, saw and electro-cautery must be minimally or not used. The need to have covers for power tools like those currently used for arthroscopy equipment's and how to dispose the irrigating fluid without floor or personnel contamination needs to be worked out .Also the need to shift to un-reamed intramedullary nails and hand reamers and hand drills to reduce the amount of AGP may have to be borne in mind.",

Conclusion Safety of the patients and the staff is foremost important while considering the orthopaedic surgery during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the hospitals must have adequate infrastructure and resources to deal with these critical cases. An appropriate number of beds both in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, PPEs, ventilators and trained staff (anaesthetists and interventionists), peri-anaesthesia units, critical care, diagnostic imaging, and laboratory services to treat all emergency and non-emergency patients Any resumption of elective surgeries or reopening of the hospital should be approved by the appropriate state health authorities, dealing with COVID management action plan. The surgeon should assess the availability of coronavirus test and its testing policies. The hospital should have COVID-19 testing facility for the health care workers and patients. If such testing and other facilities are not available then the surgeons must ensure first to create a safe environment in which elective or emergency orthopaedic surgery can be done. . During the peri Pandemic times, conservative management and operative treatments requiring minimal invasion and shorter surgical times should be preferred, over complex and long orthopaedic surgeries and those which are likely to generate significant amount of aerosols. There has to be significantly superior clinical outcomes of the proposed surgical procedure over the non-operative treatment to justify surgery.",
