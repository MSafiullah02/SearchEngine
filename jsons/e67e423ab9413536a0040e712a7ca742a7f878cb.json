These figures are difficult to extrapolate globally and to confirm, as epidemiological studies looking at the population at risk in different world areas are lacking, but the huge number of severely ill patients with ARDS due to primary influenza pneumonia (an extremely unusual complication) observed in the Southern Cone, suggest that these estimations could be realistic.

Pneumonia is the most significant complication of influenza. The presentation of pneumonia includes: 'Primary' influenza viral pneumonia secondary bacterial pneumonia and mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia. Primary influenza viral pneumonia may be the least common of the pneumonic complications but it is also the most severe. It presents as acute influenza that does not resolve but instead progresses relentlessly, with persistent fever, dyspnea, and eventual cyanosis. Sputum production is generally scanty, but the sputum can contain blood. Few physical signs may be evident early in the illness. In more advanced cases, diffuse rales may be noted, and chest X-ray findings consistent with diffuse interstitial infiltrates and/or ARDS may be present (Fig. 1) .

ARDS is usually severe, with PaO 2 /FiO 2 < than 150 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be high and optimized according to a mechanical basis. In our experience, we initially select PEEP according to the methods used in the ExPress trial where PEEP was adjusted based on airway pressure and was kept as high as possible without increasing the maximal inspiratory plateau pressure above 28 to 30 cmH 2 O [10] . In more severe respiratory failure, we also set PEEP according to the transpulmonary pressure, by using esophageal-pressure measurements. In secondary, but also in primary ARDS the lungs can suffer substantial effects of chest wall elastance and may be effectively compressed by high pleural pressures with their alveoli collapsed at the end of expiration, even though moderate or high PEEP levels are applied. Therefore, PEEP is set at a level necessary to obtain a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary-pressure to improve the oxygenation, an end-inspiratory transpulmonary-presure less than 20 cmH 2 O to minimize stress-inducing ventilator lung injury, and a pulmonary driving pressure (end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure less end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure) e 10 cmH 2 O to avoid straininducing ventilator lung injury (Fig. 3) .

Currently, four antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza: Amantadine, rimantadine (both cannot be used for the treatment of H1N1 influenza due to resistance), oseltamivir, available only for oral administration, and zanamivir, available as an inhalation agent; the two latter drugs are both sialic acid analogs that inhibit viral neuraminidases by competitively binding with the active enzyme site of influenza A and B viruses.
