All are vital to the work of maintaining and improving health. There are no absolute standards of need and there is wide variation in the health workforce, even in the industrialized countries. But there are clearly needs for supplies of health personnel to meet the needs of a population and methods to train them, employ them, and retain them. Those countries with exceedingly low levels of numbers of health workers will have difficulty achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the year 2015 and beyond.

The great achievements of public health of the twentieth century led to doubling of life expectancy in the industrialized countries and the emergence of important health advances even in the least developed countries. New challenges of globalization of diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), persisting tropical diseases and other emerging communicable diseases, and disasters, terrorism, genocide and pandemics of avian influenza present great challenges in the twenty-first century. But the main causes of death are the non-communicable diseases (NCDs), where prevention has shown truly amazing positive results in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and injuries. However, much remains to be done in the high-income as well as in middle- and low-income countries for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention to reduce morbidity and avoidable deaths, i.e., deaths that may be prevented by risk reduction or preventive measures, such as lung cancer from cigarette smoking and exposure. The key to many of the future achievements in reducing the burden of disease lies in health promotion along with advances in the biomedical side of prevention with, for example, new vaccines to prevent or modify infectious diseases and NCDs, especially cancers. Despite improved prevention, NCDs, including mental and oral disease, are still a major public health problem in high-income countries and growing rapidly in low- and middle income countries (see Chapters 6 and 7Chapter 6Chapter 7).",

Health care providers at all levels must not only be educated for competence and humaneness in clinical functions, but also be continuous learners, knowledgeable in the medical and social sciences of health including the economic aspects of health care. They must be aware of and able to synthesize knowledge from related fields such as epidemiology, economics, and management, as well as the social and behavioral sciences.

With growing emphasis on health economics and health promotion and disease prevention, there was a realization that excess medical personnel would not contribute to the national health, and that in some countries the excess of medical personnel had become a liability. In both fee-for-service medicine and salaried health service, increases in physician supply generate increases in health expenditures. Supply and demand market forces do not adapt well to health care, because the consumer demand is to a large extent generated by provider decisions (e.g., for return visits, investigation, or hospitalization). Fees may be fixed arbitrarily or by negotiation with a public insurance mechanism; the service is paid by a third party, and the consumer is less knowledgeable about the medical condition and needs than the provider.",

During the 1980s, the province experienced a marked economic downturn and zero population growth, but the supply of physicians and services per physician increased by some 20 percent. The reduced numbers of clients per physician led to an increase both in fees and in volume of services per capita so that physician incomes were sustained.

As the current workforce nears retirement age it becomes clear that even this may be insufficient to maintain basic health care services. The shortages encompass nearly every field, but are most pronounced for rural areas, primary care, and public health; fewer than 32 percent of physicians in the USA practice as generalists. The American Association of Family Physicians predicts a need for an increase of at least 40 percent of physicians in primary care alone by 2020. Increasing the percentage of female medical graduates has only partially met increased workforce needs as many work part time during parts of their careers because of family obligations, while there is a higher tendency for male graduates to leave the medical profession for other fields, and specialized medical practice makes a more attractive career than primary care.",

A strong national health policy can nevertheless be constructed, even in a poor country, by well-defined health programs. Community and rural health policy in China during the 1950s was based on a number of elements: development of a 3-year family doctor training program for rural service, upgrading training of village doctors to physician assistant level, and incentives to encourage work in the countryside and at a grassroots level. This program was successful in raising health standards in China beyond those that might have been expected from its economic level. With recent economic reforms, this system is going through profound changes (see Chapter 13).",

The demand for training as physicians may be high, and the medical schools have an interest in training more students for financial or prestige reasons. The creation of new private medical schools, if unregulated, will be based on a profit motive and not take into account the needs or capacity of the country to absorb new graduates. This leads to the creation of excessive training capacity and a surplus of poorly trained doctors with little prospect of professional employment, as is happening in some mid-level developing countries.",

This approach has been less accepted since the 1980s; even in free market societies, it inflates the costs of health care and fails to meet needs in underserved populations or specialties. Immigration and emigration of medical personnel, or departures from active practice, are also factors in the supply and distribution of health personnel. There were also concerns during the 1980s of a possible oversupply of doctors, and medical school enrollments were limited as a policy. This approach was promoted as part of the concern for rapid increases in health care costs and partially as a result of concerns in the medical profession of excess supply bringing more competition and possibly lowering the incomes of physicians. In the 1980s, health care costs rose rapidly, associated with increasing specialization and a search for new organizational patterns of health care such as the health maintenance organizations (HMOs). There was also a growing realization that population and personal health needs depend more on prevention and health promotion than on increased supply of physicians. This led to a trend to reduce numbers of new students entering medical schools, a decrease in subspecialty training positions, and a greater reliance on immigration of doctors to the USA, Canada, and the UK. This created a growing migration of medical and nursing personnel and reliance of developed countries on importation of doctors and nurses from poorer countries, often with serious and destructive effects on poorer countries in Europe and especially in severely workforce-deficient countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",

Owing to population expansion and aging, the American Medical Association (AMA) and American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) now predict a growing shortage of physicians in the USA, particularly in primary care and underserved areas. This shortage is partially being addressed by the expansion of osteopathic schools and immigration of foreign graduates; however, the AMA and AAMC have called for a rapid increase in US medical school admissions, by 30 percent.

This approach is less likely to lead to an oversupply but may maintain an arbitrarily high level of human resources despite changes in epidemiological patterns or increased efficiency of the services.

The Carnegie Foundation sponsored a study of medical education in the USA and Canada, carried out by Abraham Flexner, a non-physician educator, who reported in 1910 on the poor quality of these commercial schools (Box 14.3\n). This report promoted university-based medical schools modeled on the Johns Hopkins University, which itself was based on successful, scientifically oriented German medical schools, combined with the strong clinical orientation of British teaching hospital medical schools. Most of the 450 commercial schools in the USA closed soon after this report and were replaced by the present 126 university-based medical schools with high standards of medical education and academic research. Since the 1950s, US medical schools have been stimulated by large amounts of federal funds channeled into research and training through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as from non-governmental sources, including private and foundation donations.BOX 14.3The Flexner Report, 1910\n\u201cFor twenty-five years there has been an enormous overproduction of uneducated and ill-trained medical practitioners in absolute disregard and without serious thought to the interests of the public.Taking the USA, physicians are four or five times as numerous in proportion as in older countries like Germany. Over-production is due to the very large numbers of commercial schools.Colleges and universities have failed to appreciate the great advance in medical education and the increased cost of teaching it along modern lines.A hospital under complete educational control is as necessary to a medical school as is a laboratory of chemistry or pathology.Trustees of hospitals, public and private, should, therefore, go to the limit of their authority in opening hospital wards to teaching. Progress for the future would seem to require a very much smaller number of medical schools, better equipped and better conducted and the needs of the public would equally require fewer physicians graduated each year better educated and better trained.\u201d\nSources: Pritchett HS.

This requires a balance among the biomedical, psychological, population-based, and sociological perspectives on health care. Teaching methods should be designed to promote the objectives of the program. Many medical schools teach primarily by lecture to very large classes, with limited supervised clinical experience, which reduces the chance for the student to develop patient-oriented and problem-solving skills.

The number of qualified applicants not accepted in nursing baccalaureate programs in the USA reached over 75,000 in 2011, raising the issue of providing more training capacity and qualified faculty to meet the growing need for nurses to meet anticipated shortages and expanded roles in nursing practice. The shortage of schools, qualified faculty personnel, and general funds makes it difficult to meet the challenge of nursing shortage through private\u2013public initiatives with governmental support.

Pharmacists, for example (Box 14.7\n), can help to educate patients with long-term care needs, such as those with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity management, about risk reduction, complications, and compliance with medical management. Dental hygienists can help to reinforce health promotion messages such as smoking cessation, mouth care, healthful nutrition, and weight control, during routine dental hygiene care. The same can be said for physiotherapists, hearing technicians, and many other specialized ancillary care providers. Public health orientation should be included in the basic training of all health professionals and technicians in messages of how a healthful lifestyle is important for the prevention of many chronic conditions and their complications, for reinforcement of basic primary care messages for self-care.BOX 14.7Pharmacists as Health Promoters in Management of Cardiovascular and Other Non-Communicable DiseasesCompliance and safety of medical management is a major issue, especially in relation to health care for non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of death in adults worldwide, or in the management of diabetes, a major and growing public health problem. Pharmacist skills are complementary to those of primary care physicians and nurses, and can contribute to health promotion and improved safety of care of chronic patients. On the basis of their knowledge of medications, communication skills, and high accessibility to the public, pharmacists are valuable resources, for example in the management of CVDs.Pharmacists are well positioned to provide health promotion counseling, such as in smoking cessation, safe medication management and instructions to patients, and formulating and implementing medication plans with computerized records. Pharmacists can help to analyze reasons for non-adherence, and provide electronic reminders to support essential medication adherence, screening, and monitoring services, as well as vaccination or home care services.Pharmacists can also serve the patient by conducting medication reviews and can act in liaison with the community care team (primary care physician, nurse) as well as hospital care. Pharmacists can therefore play an increased role in health care of chronic patients by assisting physicians and other health care professionals in patient care and by participating in prevention and management programs.A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis showed substantial benefit of pharmacist interventions in the management of major CVD risk factors among outpatients in North America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. Patients allocated to pharmacist interventions achieved greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and in the risk of smoking compared to the usual group.The types of intervention that can be conducted by pharmacists, alone or in collaboration with physicians or nurses, include:\u2022patient education and counseling on medications, lifestyle or medication adherence\u2022recommendations to physicians regarding medication changes or problems of medication adherence\u2022medication management \u2013 reviewing patient medications directly from patient interviews or from medical records, assessing medication adherence or adjustment of medications\u2022scrutinizing and improving the quality of medication prescription among elderly people in the primary care setting to prevent common inappropriate medication prescriptions and multiple specialist consultations with risks for adverse events\u2022measurement of biomarkers and risk factors such as blood pressure and total blood cholesterol for screening and monitoring\u2022health care professionals\u2019 education.\nPharmacists can play a valuable role in the long-term care of patients with other chronic diseases, e.g., diabetes, heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, or cancer. Greater integration of pharmacists as part of a health care team is a potentially valuable resource for improving management of CVDs and other chronic diseases. The role of pharmacists in the community is slowly changing and, with appropriate training, pharmacists can become more effective and relevant health promoters.Sources: Courtesy of: Val\u00e9rie Santschi, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (IUMSP), Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.

This is especially important for elderly patients, where nutrition and compliance with medication may be compromised by isolation, clouded memory, and confusion.

By this agreement, signatory states agreed in principle to work towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA), to improve the quality of higher (i.e., post-secondary) education, and to provide for enhanced movement of students and academics within the EU. The motivation was to harmonize and raise European standards of postsecondary education to competitive levels in an education-based world competitive economy. The three overall objectives of the Bologna Process have been from the start: introduction of the three cycle system (bachelor/master/doctorate), quality assurance, and recognition of qualifications and periods of study. The Bologna Declaration initiated a \u201cseries of reforms needed to make European Higher Education more compatible and comparable, more competitive and more attractive for Europeans and for students and scholars from other continents.

Many European countries are still in transition or development with currently poor standards of public health. Training in professional aspects of public health is vital to the educational goals of participating members, but also to the public health movement as a whole, within basic principles of ethics and values for the modern public health movement, and of the highest standards of public health practice. In 2011, ASPHER established the Agency for Public Health Education Accreditation (APHEA) in association with other prominent public health organizations to accredit MPH programs in Europe. The core subject domain criteria for accreditation are shown in Table 14.10\nand the first two European MPH programs underwent accreditation in 2012. At the same time, strong interest is evolving in defining competencies of graduates of MPH programs (Box 14.13\n).BOX 14.13Competencies in Public Health Education and Practice\n\u2022Competencies denote the potential for specific, defined performance standards of knowledge and skills based on public health theory and science.\u2022Competencies must be observable and transparent through appropriate performance patterns required for their achievement, related to appropriate methods to meet existent public health challenges.\u2022In public health, competencies are needed throughout complex interactive systems for achievement of goals in the mission of public health.\u2022Patterns of competencies can be assigned to individuals, professional groups, and public health organizations \u2013 thus both to individual public health professionals and to accreditation of public health institutions, systems, and other organizations, e.g., those serving specific geographic areas or populations.\u2022European lists of public health competencies cover the education levels defined by the Bologna Process, i.e., bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, PhD and continuing professional development (CPD).\u2022Documentation of satisfactory demonstration of competencies can be used as effective indicators of progress through education and training programs, leading to certification of fitness to practice in either service or academic public health careers.\u2022Certification or licensing of public health professionals, especially in countries with established coherent public health systems and well-defined career structures, can be based upon effective completion of a systematic education and training program.\u2022Lists of public health competencies have been developed by public health organizations in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe, as well as by groups and associations concerned with public health in general or subspecialties of public health such as health promotion.\u2022Such lists have many practical applications, e.g., in planning, delivery, and evaluation of education, training, and service programmes, in demonstration of completion of training, or to support employment in construction of job descriptions and in annual reviews of performance.\u2022Even with similarities, there are variations in the structure of lists of public health competencies, e.g., between two UK lists (one designed for training, the other for employment), and the lists produced by the US Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH).\u2022European lists produced by the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region (ASPHER) cover population health as well as health systems and public health operations; the latter classifies and subdivides public health competencies into:\u2022methods in public health\u2022population health and its social and economic determinants\u2022population health and its material (physical, radiological, chemical, and biological) determinants\u2022health policy; economics; organizational theory and management\u2022health promotion: health education, health protection and disease prevention\u2022ethics.\n\u2022ASPHER\u2019s European Core Competencies Programme has, since its initiation in 2006, involved about 100 researchers/teachers at member schools, European Ministries of Health, civil servants, and public health practitioners. International conferences were devoted to discussion of competencies, workshops at European and global public health conferences, as well as practitioner-school workshops in a series of European countries, with support by the EU in collaboration with public health partner organizations.\u2022As of September 2012, ASPHER\u2019s European lists of expanded core competencies (population health, health systems, and public health operations) have been endorsed by member states of the World Health Organization\u2019s European Region.\u2022Development, implementation, and use of lists of competencies and their interaction with public health practice and research is a continuing process rooted in well-established organizational structures.\nSources: Anders Foldspang, School of Public Health, Aarhus University, Denmark; Christopher Birt, Department of Public Health, University of Liverpool, UK.

Health education programs designed to reduce health risks and reduce costs were shown to have documented effectiveness, with reductions in claims of 20 percent in some health insurance systems in the USA. Specific program features including chronic disease self-management, risk reduction, and increased self-efficacy appear important. This concept was further supported by the review by the CDC of public health achievements in the twentieth century, in which reductions of the burden of disease were directly related in large measure to public health programs. In the late 20th and first decade of the 21st century, new challenges with important achievements were seen with HIV, SARS, bioterrorism, and natural pandemics heightened the sense of concern, need, and urgency to strengthen public health training in the USA and internationally.",

These include training program offerings: evidence-based public health, physical activity and public health, and social marketing. These courses illustrate the commitment of the Prevention Research Centers Program to helping in creation of a better trained public health workforce. The Moldova Ministry of Health, working with the WHO local office, developed a program for public health workers in control of NCDs; and the Moldova School of Public Health in Chisinau provides distance learning technology to support the spread of this knowledge to all parts of this small and very poor country in Eastern Europe. The Braun School of Public Health in Jerusalem provided support materials for use in a \u201ctraining of trainers\u201d program, a distance learning initiative implemented by the local WHO office in Moldova.",
