Nowadays, to provide a comfortable built environment, central ventilation systems are commonly installed in modern commercial, institutional and public buildings, and therefore the ventilation ducts become one main way to transport particle-laden airflow [8]. In real ventilation ducts, one of the main parts is the bend for flow direction adjustment and pollutant aerosol deposition [9]. Additionally, there are other practical applications of particle flowing through bends, including the removal of particulates from industrial duct bends [10] and extractive sampling of pollutants in gas flow [11], [12].",

This behavior provides quantitative evidence through simulation that the deposition behind the bend is enhanced due to bend-induced turbulence.

The reduction degree from s\u2217 = 2 to 5 is moderate and from s\u2217 = 6 to 12 is minor. The decreasing deposition could be probably attributed to the turbulent level reduction when the distance increase behind bends as shown in Fig. 10\n.

In the presentations of the deposition ratio and the following enhancement factor, Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4) were adopted at the domain inlet to guarantee the airflow was fully developed in straight duct ahead of bends. The results range from R\nda = 0.91 to 15.2, which indicate the quantitative increase of particle deposition caused by bend. Particle accumulation is very high near the bend outlet. Deposition ratios increase from 4.61 to 15.2 times for particle diameters increasing from d\np = 3\u201323 \u03bcm. The deposition is reduced sharply from areas near the bend outlet to those further away from it. From s\u2217 = 10 to 12, the deposition ratios are close to unity 1. This phenomena means that the flow disturbance due to bend is weakened to a marginal level at these areas, and the length of increased deposition due to the presence of the bend is 10 times as long as the cross dimension (D) of straight duct. This interpretation is partially supported by the experimental measurements of particle deposition in developing turbulent flow in the studies of Sippola and Nazaroff [16].",

The enhancement deposition ratios in bends and behind bends correspond to the first and second term in Eq. (18), respectively. These ratios are calculated based on Eqs. (16), (17), (18). They can be also called as additional deposition caused by bend. For small particles, for example, d\np = 3 \u03bcm, the enhancement deposition ratio is rather low because the ratio considers the bend as equivalent straight duct and the Stokes number indicates that small particles are easy to follow fluid flow. In other words, smaller particles are hardly to impact onto bend walls. However, the flow pattern change by bends also leads to deposition enhancement behind bends, and the total ratio is mainly composed of the enhancement deposition behind bends, approximately 99% for particles of d\np = 3 \u03bcm. This behavior is probably due to that eddies behind bends are adaptable to catch smaller particles onto wall surfaces as demonstrated in Fig. 12. For larger particles, the major composition of the total ratio is reversed, i.e. in bends. However, the deposition behind bends are still of a great portion, approximately 42% for particles of d\np = 23 \u03bcm. Therefore, when describing the particle deposition induced by bends, the general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends is much better than sole particle accumulation in bends.",

Particle deposition distribution and deposition velocity in 90\u00b0 ventilation bends with different surface materials were analyzed numerically, and the simulation results were also validated with experimental data. Bend-induced deposition ratio and deposition velocity were also discussed and fitted quantitatively. To summarize, the following conclusions can be drawn:a)Predicted particle deposition velocities in bends are much higher than those in straight ducts by one to two orders of magnitude. Between the predicted particle relaxation time 1.2 and 6.4, the particle deposition velocities with surfaces of highest capture velocity can be 1.2 times larger than those of lowest capture velocity. This behavior indicates that the duct bend wall with surfaces of high capture velocity is easy to accumulate contaminant particles.b)Current simulation provided quantitative evidence that the deposition behind a bend is sharply enhanced due to bend-induced turbulence. Particle deposition had a peak value near bend outlet. Along the straight duct behind bends, the depositions decreased exponentially toward a deposition pattern of fully developed turbulent flow since the bend-induced eddies are weakened.c)It is much better to adopt the general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends to describe the particle deposition induced by bends. Deposition behind bends forms a large portion of the total bend-induced deposition, especially for smaller particles.d)Power decay trend was obtained between the enhancement deposition ratio (R\ndae) and dimensionless distance (s\u2217). Non-linear exponential decay trend was also given among enhancement factor of deposition velocity behind a bend (e\nda), dimensionless distance (s\u2217) and particle Stokes number (St). These fitting equations are valid according to the current simulation condition for the ranges of s\u2217 = 1\u201312 and St = 0.016\u20130.89. Finally, two fitting equations of dimensionless deposition velocity behind bend were developed to model the deposition trend easily and universally.\n",
