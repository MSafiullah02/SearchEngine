            "text": "The recent, widespread neurological deficits caused by an emergent strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) have caught the world off guard (Petersen et al., 2016, Wikan and Smith, 2016). ZIKV was first identified in the forests of Uganda, and infection was generally benign in humans (Dick et al., 1952). However, this new strain of ZIKV is far more virulent and causes a range of clinical anomalies (Petersen et al., 2016, Rasmussen et al., 2016, Wikan and Smith, 2016). Most notable are microcephaly and other congenital defects in infants born to mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy (Mlakar et al., 2016, Petersen et al., 2016, Rasmussen et al., 2016, Wikan and Smith, 2016). Although the exact mechanism of neuropathogenesis remains uncertain, clinical abnormalities have been linked to the aberrant development and loss of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (Cugola et al., 2016, Gabriel et al., 2017, Garcez et al., 2016, Li et al., 2016a, Li et al., 2016b, Tang et al., 2016). The contemporary strain of ZIKV has enhanced replication capacity and a specialized tropism for NPCs (Cugola et al., 2016, Dang et al., 2016, Garcez et al., 2016, Li et al., 2016b, Tang et al., 2016), although other types of cells are susceptible (Tabata et al., 2016, Weisblum et al., 2017). The infection inhibits NPC proliferation and differentiation and can trigger apoptosis or autophagy. Critically, the highest rates of birth defects occur in pregnant mothers who are infected during their first and second trimesters. This is presumably because, during the early stages of gestation, NPCs have a greater susceptibility to ZIKV infection, and there is more viral transfer across the placental barrier (Mlakar et al., 2016, Petersen et al., 2016, Rasmussen et al., 2016, Wikan and Smith, 2016). To fully protect the developing fetuses, an intervention must occur before this period or, ideally, prior to infection (Marston et al., 2016).",

For ZIKV and other flaviviruses, human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies target the surface envelope glycoprotein (E) that facilitates infection (Dejnirattisai et al., 2015, Dowd et al., 2011, Dowd and Pierson, 2011, Fernandez et al., 2017, Fibriansah et al., 2015, Heinz and Stiasny, 2012, Magnani et al., 2017, Pierson and Diamond, 2008, Pierson and Graham, 2016, Robbiani et al., 2017, Rogers et al., 2017, Sapparapu et al., 2016, Stettler et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017b, Zhao et al., 2016). We previously reported on a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from the longitudinal samples of a ZIKV-convalescent individual and characterized their neutralizing activities, epitope specificities, and development timeline over the course of infection (Yu et al., 2017). We also reported on mouse models of ZIKV infection and microcephaly, with enhanced specificity for neurological infection using a contemporary ZIKV Asian strain (GZ01). In the model of microcephaly, the virus was inoculated directly into the lateral ventricles of the fetal mouse brain (Li et al., 2016a). ZIKV replicated in the fetal brain, with preferential infection of NPCs. Infection resulted in cell-cycle arrest, differentiation defects, and a large number of cell deaths, as well as clinical presentations of microcephaly (Li et al., 2016a). Here, we use the mouse models of ZIKV infection and microcephaly to analyze the in vivo protective activities of six human mAbs and compare the findings with our reported in vitro neutralization activity, as measured by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Our results offer compelling evidence that the in vivo protection is directly associated with in vitro neutralization. One antibody, ZK2B10, provides complete protection in pre-exposure treatment and partial protection in post-exposure therapy, with markedly reduced tissue pathology. We believe that ZK2B10 is a promising candidate for the development of antibody-based interventions and informs vaccine design specific to ZIKV infection.",

All these (ZK8-4, ZK5-2, ZK22F6, ZK2C2, ZK7C3, and ZK2B10) were isolated by our team. Two additional ZIKV Domain III (DIII)-specific mAbs (ZV67 and Z006) isolated by others were included for comparative analysis (Robbiani et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2016). A human antibody, Middle East respiratory syndrome-4 (MERS-4), targeting the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was used as a negative control. Our mAbs were initially isolated from the peripheral B cells of a convalescent Chinese man who acquired ZIKV while traveling to Venezuela during the outbreak in 2016 (Yu et al., 2017). Specimens were derived from sequential blood samples collected on day 4 (ZK8-4), day 7 (ZK5-2), day 15 (ZK22F6), or day 106 (ZK2C2, ZK7C3, and ZK2B10) after symptom onset. They targeted the ZIKV E with varying degrees of binding and neutralizing activities and epitope specificities (Yu et al., 2017). For example, ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 were strictly ZIKV specific and demonstrated the most potent neutralizing activities, as measured by PRNT. Of these, ZK2B10 recognized DIII, while ZK7C3 was specific for Domain I/Domain II (DI/DII). In comparison, ZK8-4, ZK5-2, ZK22F6, and ZK2C2 were much less potent against ZIKV but cross-neutralized other members of the flavivirus family, such as dengue virus serotypes DENV1 and DENV2. On the ZIKV envelope, they targeted either DI/DII (ZK8-4, ZK5-2, and ZK22F6) or DI/DII/DIII (ZK2C2). In terms of genetic analyses, these antibodies demonstrated diverse heavy-chain variable regions. Two, ZK8-4 and ZK22F6, fell into the immunoglobulin-heavy variable (IGHV)4-39 family, while ZK5-2 and ZK7C3 belonged to the IGHV3-23 family. Finally, ZK2B10 and ZK2C2 belonged to the IGHV1\u20138 and IGHV3\u201330 families, respectively.",

            "text": "To test prophylactic activity against ZIKV infection, 5 mg/kg of each mAb was administered intraperitoneally to a group of three pregnant mice on embryonic day 14.5 (Figure 1A). The following day (E15.5), the developing littermate fetuses in each pregnant mouse were either left untouched (ZIKV\u2212; Figure 1A, blue) or inoculated with 350 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of ZIKV Asian strain GZ01 directly into the lateral ventricles of the brain (ZIKV+; Figure 1A, red). The neonates were closely monitored after delivery and analyzed for a complementary set of clinical, virological, and neuropathological outcomes on post-natal day (P)3 and for survival up to P28. As shown in Figure 1B, the levels of protection conferred by the different mAbs varied considerably but clearly correlated with their neutralizing activities, as measured by half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (ICs50) in the PRNT (Yu et al., 2017). The most potently neutralizing mAb, ZK2B10, conferred complete protection. Survival rates of infected fetuses were as high as 100% on P28. The next potent, ZK7C3, however, conferred only partial protection with median survival of 16 days. The two antibodies (ZV67 and Z006) isolated by others, together with the rest of the mAbs isolated by us, offered negligible protection and were virtually similar to the isotype control MERS-4. We also assessed impact on developing body weights and found weights measured on P3 closely correlated with the neutralizing activity. The ZIKV+ neonates treated with the most potent mAbs, ZK2B10 and ZK7C3, had weight gain similar to that of their ZIKV\u2212 littermates. The ZIKV+ neonates treated with ZV67, Z006, and the remaining mAbs failed to do so. The control ZIKV+ MERS-4 group had the greatest loss in body weight.",

            "text": "Next, we studied whether the protection pattern observed in the pregnant mice also occurred in non-pregnant mice. We administered 300 \u03bcg of each mAb (ZK8-4, ZK5-2, ZK22F6, ZK2C2, ZK7C3, ZK2B10, ZV67, and Z006) or isotype control MERS-4 to a group of four 4- to 6-week-old AG6 mice via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. The following day, animals were challenged with 104 PFUs of ZIKV Asian strain GZ01 via the i.p. route. Survival rates, body weight, and viral RNA copies in the blood were monitored for up to 14 days (Figure 1D). Consistent with the outcomes for pregnant mice, the level of protection in non-pregnant mice correlated with antibody neutralizing activities as measured by half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (ICs50) in the PRNT (Figure 1E). For example, the most potent and protective mAb in pregnant mice, ZK2B10, provided complete protection in non-pregnant mice, with survival rates of 100% 14 days after the challenge. The next potent and protective, ZK7C3, conferred only partial protection, with median survival of 13 days. The rest of the tested mAbs, including the DIII-specific ones (ZV67 and Z006) isolated by others (Robbiani et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2016), offered even lower levels of protection. ZK8-4 was virtually identical to the isotype control MERS-4. Similarly, changes in body weight measured over the 14-day follow-up also correlated with the neutralizing activities. The ZIKV+ mice treated with ZK2B10 maintained relatively stable body weight throughout the study, although there was a noticeable decline after the first blood sample collection on day 5 (Figure 1F). In contrast, ZIKV+ mice treated with ZK7C3 lost substantial body weight beginning on day 9 post-challenge. Animals treated with the remaining mAbs had severe and rapid losses in body weight that coincided with a clinical deterioration (Figure 1E). Lastly, for ZIKV+ mice treated with ZK2B10, blood levels of viral RNA were indistinguishable from those measured in uninfected animals on both day 5 (2.23 \u00b1 0.16 versus 2.54 \u00b1 0.13) and day 13 (2.88 \u00b1 0.34 versus 2.65 \u00b1 0.13) after challenge (Figure 1G). However, RNA levels measured in ZK7C3-treated mice were, on average, 1 log greater on day 5 (3.29 \u00b1 0.17 versus 2.23 \u00b1 0.16) and more than 3 logs greater on day 13 (6.30 \u00b1 0.06 versus 2.88 \u00b1 0.34), compared to ZK2B10. The remaining mAbs failed to suppress viral replication. The measured ZIKV RNA load on day 5 ranged from 3.82 to 5.16 logs higher than that of ZK2B10, depending on the mAb used (Figure 1G). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the protective patterns of each mAb were similar in both pregnant and non-pregnant mice and closely mirrored their respective in vitro neutralizing activities.",

            "text": "The protective effects of each mAb on body weight and overall survival mirrored their respective virological and neuropathological outcomes in treated mice. For instance, RNA loads measured in ZIKV+ neonates treated with ZK2B10 were suppressed in the blood (2.16 \u00b1 0.12 log10 copies per milliliter) and the brain (2.18 \u00b1 0.20 log10 copies per gram) to levels indistinguishable from those in ZIKV\u2212 littermates. In fact, ZK2B10 was able to reduce the ZIKV RNA by 3.77 logs in the blood and 6.86 logs in the brain, relative to that in the ZIKV+ MERS-4 group (Figures 2A and 2B). In comparison, ZK7C3 was equally effective at suppressing replication in blood (2.18 \u00b1 0.12 log10 copies per milliliter) but only moderately protective in the brain (6.41 \u00b1 0.28 log10 copies per gram). The mAbs ZV67 and Z006 only moderately suppressed ZIKV replication in the blood (5.53 \u00b1 0.14 and 5.53 \u00b1 0.17 log10 copies per milliliter, respectively) and the brain (8.09 \u00b1 0.09 and 8.25 \u00b1 0.08 log10 copies per gram, respectively). None of the remaining mAbs notably suppressed replication in either blood or brain tissue. All of the ZIKV+ neonates treated with these mAbs had high levels of ZIKV RNA, which were similar to levels in the ZIKV+ MERS-4 control group and significantly higher than those in their ZIKV\u2212 littermates (Figures 2A and 2B). Importantly, low levels of ZIKV RNA were associated with the healthier development of the neonatal brains. Of the six representative mAbs selected for in-depth neuropathological study, ZIKV+ mice treated with either ZK2B10 or ZK7C3 maintained normal brain growth and structure. There were no notable differences in cerebral size, cortical thickness, or lateral ventricle area between these ZIKV+ neonates and their ZIKV\u2212 littermates (Figures 2D\u20132H). However, ZIKV+ mice treated with ZV67 and Z006 received only moderate protection, while ZK22F6 and MERS-4 failed to provide any protection. Low protection was measured by reduced cerebral size, thinner cortices, and enlarged lateral ventricles in ZIKV+ neonates compared to their ZIKV\u2212 littermates (Figures 2D\u20132H). It is interesting to note that the E-specific human immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the brain were higher in mice treated with ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 compared to the other mAb groups. In particular, the levels of ZK2B10 (0.55 \u00b1 0.11 mg/kg, which is translated into 0.09 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcg/mL) in ZIKV+ neonates were well above the IC50 neutralization values measured in the PRNT, whereas IgG levels in the other mAb groups measured less than or similar to those in the negative control PBS group (Figures 1A and 2C). These results indicate that the tested mAbs were able to transport across both the maternal-fetal placental barrier and the primitive blood-brain barrier of developing fetuses (Saunders et al., 2014).",

As shown in Figure 3\nA, in ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 groups, no ZIKV-infected cells (green) or apoptotic cells (Cas3+, red) were detected in the cortices of either ZIKV+ neonates or their ZIKV\u2212 littermates. The mature neurons (NeuN; Figure 3A, gray) and nuclei (DAPI; Figure 3A, blue) appeared healthy, with a tightly packed structure throughout the tissue sections. In distinct contrast, a large number of ZIKV-positive cells were identified throughout the cortices of the ZIKV+ neonates in ZV67, Z006, ZK22F6, and MERS-4 groups. This high prevalence of infection was associated with significant cell death (Figure 3A, red) and degradation of the cortical structure (Figure 3A, gray and blue). We also quantitatively assessed the protective activity of ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 using marker cells from multiple tissue sections. As shown in Figures 3B and 3C, treatment with ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 in ZIKV+ neonates reduced ZIKV infection and cell death to levels indistinguishable from those of their ZIKV\u2212 littermates. Furthermore, in the ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 groups, counts of mature neurons were equivalent between ZIKV+ neonates and their ZIKV\u2212 littermates (Figure 3D). However, for the ZIKV+ neonates treated with either ZV76, Z006, ZK22F6, or MERS-4, ZIKV-positive cell and apoptotic cell counts were as high as 7,500 cells and 5,600 cells, on average, per square-millimeter tissue section, respectively (Figures 3B and 3C). Counts of mature neurons were also significantly reduced in these groups (Figure 3D). These results support the enhanced therapeutic activity of ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 at the cellular and tissue levels relative to ZV67, ZV006, ZK22F6, and MERS-4 and also offer an explanation for their impressive in vivo protection of developing fetuses.",

            "text": "As ZK2B10 demonstrated the greatest prophylactic efficacy against ZIKV infection, we went on to evaluate its treatment efficacy after ZIKV infection of the developing fetuses. Specifically, after the littermate fetuses were either left untouched (ZIKV\u2212) or inoculated with 350 PFUs of ZIKV GZ01 in the lateral ventricle (ZIKV+) on E15.5, we administered 5 mg/kg ZK2B10 i.p. to the pregnant mice. This was done either on the same day (E15.5, day 0), 1 day later (E16.5, day 1), or 2 days later (E17.5, day 2). The littermate neonates were closely monitored after delivery and analyzed for the same outcomes measured in the prevention experiments (Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 4\nA, delaying treatment from day 0 to either day 1 or day 2 reduced the survival percentages. Treatment on day 0 offered the most effective treatment, with a median survival of about 19 days. This is significantly higher than that of mice treated on either day 1 (11 days) or day 2 (13 days). The survival advantage conferred by treatment on day 0 corresponded with a clear reduction of viral load in the brain (Figure 4D) and less damage to the cortical thickness and lateral ventricles (Figures 4F and 4G). However, the effect was less obvious when measured by body weight or blood serum viral loads on P3 (Figures 4B and 4C). Considering that, in our mouse model, the brain is the initial and active site of viral replication, we expected that antibody treatment effects would be more sensitive and immediate in this organ and would be apparent before effects on other organs and body weight as a whole. This hypothesis was supported by immunohistochemical analyses of brain sections derived from P3 neonates. As shown in Figure 5\nA, ZIKV-positive cells (green) were only sporadically detected in the day-0 treatment group. However, they were detected throughout the cortices if treatment was delayed to day 1 or day 2. A greater level of infection was associated with increased cell death (Figure 5A, red) and cortical abnormalities (Figure 5A, gray and blue). In particular, the tightly packed and well-organized structure of matured neurons in the cortices became loosely connected and disorganized. Furthermore, a quantitative assessment of marker cells derived from multiple tissue sections supported the evidence that the time of treatment administration impacted treatment efficacy. For instance, in the ZIKV+ neonate group, treatment on day 0 significantly suppressed the number of ZIKV-positive cells to 5 \u00b1 3 and apoptotic cells to 6 \u00b1 4 per square millimeter of tissue section. Treatment on day 2, however, allowed widespread cell infection and cell death counts as high as 3,323 \u00b1 1,971 and 399 \u00b1 329 per square-millimeter tissue section, respectively (Figures 5B and 5C). However, although tissue samples from all three temporal treatment groups showed structural abnormalities in the cortices, there were no obvious reductions in the total number of mature neurons (Figure 5D). Treatment with the isotype MERS-4 control was worst among all groups, with no signs of protection (Figures 4 and 5). These results highlight the critical role of ZK2B10 in attenuating disease progression by inhibiting cell infection and death at the cellular and tissue levels. Furthermore, the time of administration relative to infection impacts efficacy. Treatment has the greatest protective effect when initiated immediately after infection.",

We showed that different mAbs demonstrated distinct protective activity against ZIKV infection and that the major determinant of efficacy is their intrinsic neutralizing activities. A single i.p. injection of pregnant and non-pregnant mice with the most potent mAb, ZK2B10, provided developing fetuses and adult animals with a complete protection against ZIKV infection. Treatment with ZK2B10 markedly reduced fetal infection and tissue pathology and significantly delayed mortality. Thus, ZK2B10 is a promising candidate for the development of antibody-based intervention and informs rational design of ZIKV vaccine.",

            "text": "Two unique aspects of our study are worth highlighting here. One is based in the tested mAbs that are all derived from the same ZIKV convalescent individual at different time points in the course of natural infection. Each has distinct neutralizing activity, epitope specificity, and lineage ancestry (Yu et al., 2017). This diversity not only allows us to pinpoint the major determinants of protection in the mouse model but also provides evidence for when protective potential arises during the course of a natural infection in humans. Our results clearly show that neutralizing activity, rather than other features, is the critical biomarker for protection against ZIKV infection, although the role of Fc-mediated antiviral functions still need further investigation (Dejnirattisai et al., 2016, Pierson and Graham, 2016, Sapparapu et al., 2016, Stettler et al., 2016). Among the mAbs tested here, ZK2B10 is the most potent, and its epitope is located in the lateral ridge region within the DIII of E (Yu et al., 2017). mAbs that target DIII with potent neutralizing activity have also been isolated by other groups, derived from either infected humans or mice, and have been shown to be effective in various models of ZIKV pathogenesis (Fernandez et al., 2017, Magnani et al., 2017, Robbiani et al., 2017, Stettler et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017b, Zhao et al., 2016). Some weakly neutralizing mAbs have also been reported against the same domain (Robbiani et al., 2017, Sapparapu et al., 2016, Stettler et al., 2016, Zhao et al., 2016). It would be hard to determine whether this convergence on DIII is a purely random event or whether DIII epitopes are somehow more exposed and, therefore, more accessible by the mAbs. It would be interesting to compare the exact epitopes of the highly potent mAbs to see whether the vulnerable spots are widely spread or confined to restricted regions on the DIII. This information would undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of the immune recognition mechanisms and assist in the rational design of vaccines against ZIKV infection. Similar to other reported DIII-specific mAbs, ZK2B10 was isolated late after the onset of symptoms (106 days), when the production of DIII-specific antibodies had become more prevalent (Yu et al., 2017). However, why the DIII-specific response seems to be delayed relative to DI/II-specific responses, and whether a vaccine could induce the preferred DIII-specific response ahead of those targeting DI/II, requires more in-depth study. Nevertheless, the potent prophylactic and therapeutic activities demonstrated by ZK2B10 and other DIII-specific mAbs will serve as the key criteria for future antibody-based intervention against ZIKV infection.",

Despite the surgical sophistication required with this technique, the model has been standardized with remarkable reproducibility and captures the phenotypic features that are key to ZIKV infection in humans (Li et al., 2016a, Li et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2017a, Yuan et al., 2017). Direct inoculation eliminates the need for immune-deficient pregnant mice and allows for control over the developmental stage at which infection occurs. As a result, both pathogenesis and intervention strategies can be evaluated with more precision. Critically, it is likely the most stringent model for brain infection, as it tests the immediate protective activity of mAbs at the injection site, as well as their capacity in preventing subsequent dissemination throughout the body. In this regard, the levels of protection conveyed by ZK2B10 are, indeed, remarkable. Furthermore, direct inoculation on E15.5 also allows for the study of immediate and long-term impacts of ZIKV infection in the developing fetuses. In this study, neonates were followed up to P28, but this could have been extended to investigate the long-term sequelae of ZIKV infection, be they physiological, cognitive, or behavioral. This feature is complementary to the existing model, in which ZIKV infection was initiated earlier in embryonic development and was frequently associated with fetal demise before or shortly after delivery (Fernandez et al., 2017, Morrison and Diamond, 2017, Sapparapu et al., 2016). In the future, it would be interesting to test the panel of mAbs identified here in the early infection model in order to evaluate their protective potential.",

The present study combines these methodologies in order to evaluate the protective potential of six representative human mAbs against ZIKV infection and microcephaly. Using a single i.p. injection of mAbs in pregnant mice prior to ZIKV infection, we showed that these antibodies convey distinct levels of protection to the developing fetuses and newborns and that these levels closely mirrored their respective in vitro neutralizing activities. The most potent neutralizing antibody tested, ZK2B10, provided a complete protection from ZIKV infection in pre-exposure treatment and partial protection in post-exposure therapy, as measured by markedly reduced tissue pathology.",

All mAbs were in the human IgG1 backbone, manufactured in 293F cells (ATCC) by transient transfection, and purified by affinity chromatography using protein A agarose (Thermo Scientific).

Total RNA from the homogenized brain and the whole blood was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, QIAGEN) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (170-8890, Bio-Rad). As previously described, viral RNA copies were quantified through TaqMan qPCR amplification of ZIKV envelope genes and expressed as log10 viral RNA copies per gram for the brain or per millimeter for the blood samples calculated against the standard curve.
