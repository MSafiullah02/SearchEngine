The case is different for diffusion which requires some social contact or influence to take root. \u2022 Contagion models do not involve processes such as decision making, in which an individual makes a decision whether to become infected or not because contagion is considered a random natural process.

In the second stage, opinion leaders influence potential adopters. People who were exposed to messages from mass media did not automatically believe them. Because opinion leaders were more exposed to media and more aware of the current trends, they were able to persuade others to follow their views with the help of media communications to support their arguments.

Their immediate neighbors, in turn, will talk about the product to their neighbors and so on until finally the news about the product is spread to a large population of users in the network.
