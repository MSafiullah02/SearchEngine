Stigma is a social process that occurs between groups; this process can occur in-person and online [2-6]. Regardless of setting, research has consistently found that stigma is associated with negative health outcomes [2,4,6-9]. For example, HIV-related stigma has pushed the HIV-epidemic underground, fueling ongoing transmission [10], and other disease-related stigmas are associated with negative health outcomes ranging from missed clinical visits to suicidal ideation [1,6,9]. There is evidence to show that stigma can become internalized, and internalized stigma can lead to distrust of health professionals, skepticism of public health systems, and an unwillingness to disclose behaviors related to transmission [2,8,9]. Because the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is infectious, contact tracing is critically important to assessing community spread; thus, it is imperative that individuals trust their public health and health care systems so that they are willing to accept testing and, if diagnosed with COVD-19, report their whereabouts and activities. Therefore, creating and perpetuating stigma related to COVID-19 could be detrimental to public health efforts that require potentially stigmatized individuals to engage with their health systems.",

He tweeted \u201cThe United States will be powerfully supporting those industries... that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus...\u201d After this presidential reference, a dialogue emerged examining if the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d was xenophobic and stigmatizing, considering the availability of alternative scientific names such as coronavirus or COVID-19. Since stigma is created and perpetuated by society through social interaction and public commentary (eg, use of the term \u201cChinese virus\u201d instead of scientific terms on Twitter), and stigma is reinforced by those in power (eg, use of the term \u201cChinese virus\u201d by the US president), we hypothesized that there would be an increase in the frequency of the phrases \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201cChina virus\u201d on Twitter, comparing the prevalence of these phrases before and after the presidential reference.",

The percentage increase measures the percentage of all COVID-19 related tweets that mentioned \u201cChina virus\u201d or \u201cChinese virus\u201d exclusively. To account for variations in population size, prevalence of \u201cChinese virus\u201d tweets per 10,000 people for each US state was calculated using the following formula: . State population sizes were taken from the 2019 US Census Bureau estimates [12]. On average, the state-level percentage increase was 997%, with a minimum of 661% and a maximum of 1447%. Similarly, the prevalence increase mean was 1015%, with a minimum of 734% and a maximum of 1456%. Large variations were found across US states, with the lowest postperiod prevalence of \u201cChinese virus\u201d or \u201cChina virus\u201d in South Dakota and the highest in Wyoming.

Generally speaking, perpetuating COVID-19-related stigma by using the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d could harm public health efforts related to addressing the pandemic, specifically inciting fear and increasing distrust of public health systems by Chinese and Asian Americans. If these stigmatizing terms persist as malicious synonyms for the novel coronavirus, reparative efforts may be required to restore trust by marginalized communities.",
