This indicates a wide reach for online advertisement and recruitment for research, with the added potential to recruit populations typically considered hard-to-reach [5].",

They have also been shown to provide opportunities for connecting with individuals with specific health conditions, living in remote geographic locations, or who may have been difficult to recruit due to stigma or medical mistrust [6, 7]. Some examples of social media to advertise and recruit participants include: social networks (such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter), dating apps (Grindr, Scruff, and Jack\u2019d), and online listservs for various medical societies or health conditions. The main disadvantage of using social media for study recruitment is the lack of reach to those with limited or no internet access. This can result in reduced generalizability of research findings [7, 8]. Researchers concerned about generalizability, however, can supplement online advertisement with traditional methods.",

The main disadvantage of online screening is that it may either deter some to participate (e.g. if the form is too complicated or lengthy) or increase inappropriate participation (e.g. an individual or bot responding repeatedly to be eventually deemed eligible).

This modality lends itself well to interventions that do not require physical contact but are enhanced by face-to-face communication, such as interventions for mental health, smoking cessation, and medication adherence counseling. Participants in prior studies noted high acceptability levels in using videochat for research intervention delivery [17]. Benefits included being able to speak more candidly and being less intimidated, and experiencing reduced barriers for research participation (e.g. financial barriers related to travel expenses or time off from work, stigma associated with research participation, and physical disabilities precluding mobility) [17, 18]. In addition to providing interventions, these platforms can be used for one-on-one qualitative interviews and focus groups. They allow for video- or audio-recording of the session (with consent from the participant) which can be used later for interview transcription and analysis. Other remote methods of delivering an intervention include mobile health applications [11], computers-based programs [19], and the internet [20].",

For cross-sectional surveys or one-time assessments, provision of e-gift cards is the most convenient remote incentive. For longitudinal research, reloadable debit cards are a convenient method of payment and have been shown to be highly feasible and acceptable by research participants [24]. These debit cards can be mailed to participants without any funds loaded until confirmation of receipt and funds can be transferred from one card to another in case of lost or stolen cards. These are important benefits of reloadable debit cards over mailed gift cards.",
