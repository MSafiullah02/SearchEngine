Half of the World\u2019s population is exposed to this disease caused by a protozoan, Plasmodium, and transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito. The clinical phase in human infection corresponds to the invasion of red blood cells (RBC) by the merozo\u00efte form of the parasite; this follows a first phase of development of the sporozo\u00efte in the liver after its injection by Anopheles. In the RBC, the parasite develops into a trophozo\u00efte that internalizes and digests its host cell content, it then differentiates into schizont containing multiple merozo\u00eftes which will invade new RBC. Two forms of malaria have a particularly severe prognostic: (1) cerebral malaria (mainly in young children), due to sequestration of mature parasites in the brain, the consequence of adherence of parasitized RBC to endothelium of cerebral capillary vessels, and (2) malaria occurring in pregnant women, due to mass sequestration of infected erythrocytes in placenta.",

            "text": "Among the five species currently recognized to infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly (the others being P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi). Among 2.37 billion people are exposed across 87 countries, malaria is the cause of 300\u2013500 million clinical cases per year [2], but even though falciparum malaria is rife in nearly all tropical and subtropical areas of the World, Africa is currently the worst affected, accumulating (WHO 2004 statistics) 70% of total malaria clinical episodes which are the cause of 7% of the total number of deaths, 20% of direct child mortality (one child dies of malaria every 30s) [3], 10% of indirect child mortality [4], and a severe prognosis for mothers and children when infection occurs during the first pregnancy [5, 6]. Of these fatal outcomes, malaria is the cause of many sequelae in the surviving patients, mainly in young children [5], and disability in adults during infectious episodes. The malaria burden, expressed as DALYs (disability-adjusted life year), was ranked fourth out of all diseases for low-income countries in 2004, behind lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and AIDS [7]. Other heavy consequences of malaria include anemia that can increase child mortality and can markedly reduce power productivity in adults and a deficit in intellectual developments, which has consequences on the future evolution of development and productivity in concerned areas [8]. In lower income countries, malaria can represent 1\u20133% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. As a result, malaria is a poverty impeding factor in developing countries that are affected by this disease [8]. To face such a challenge, the international financing was increased. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFTAM) and other supports committed US$ 991.5 million for malaria in 2007. However, among the 136 countries supported by this strategy since 2002, 16 of them, representing 710 million people living in stable transmission conditions, received an estimated combined annual support lower than US$ 0.5 per capita [9], which is not enough to fight efficiently malaria.",

            "text": "An efficient fight against malaria mainly includes the control of the mosquito vector by indoor residual spraying, protection against bites by insecticide treated nets, chemoprophylaxis and chemotherapy of stated infection which gave promising results, mainly in low transmission rate areas, but failed to eradicate malaria in regions of intense transmission, even if progress was noticeable in several countries [5, 11\u201313]. However, the cost of these interventions is very high, representing up to 30% of domestic expenses in low-income countries and must be supported in a large part by international interventions (Multilateral Initiative on Malaria, Roll Back Malaria Project, GFTAM, Medicines for Malaria Venture), which have played an important role in the progress observed so far. Resistance, which spread both in Anopheles and Plasmodium, disproved the efficacy of the global fight program because low cost insecticides and drugs, the most interesting for concerned populations, are less and less efficient. For some insecticides as DDT, economical interests of concurrent products and environmental problems are adding to mosquito resistance problems. As a consequence, eradication programs were abandoned in the 1970s. With the extension of the resistance to chloroquine and some other low cost antimalarials, a resurgence of malaria occurred in many parts of the world, sometimes with devastating local epidemic episodes such as in Sri Lanka and Madagascar. High priority research includes development of new drugs for the treatment of malaria, the development of safe molecules for mass drug administration in chemoprevention, the development of new insecticides for indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, the development of vaccines with high transmission-blocking potential, improved access to treatment for poor populations, and cost efficiency of drug combinations [14].",

The occurrence of resistance of P. falciparum to several of these antimalarials provoked the search for new active molecules. Various strategies were adopted to find new antimalarials that resulted in the industrial development of mefloquine, halofantrine, artemisinin derivatives, and several antibiotics. The spread of resistance to CQ and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and the decrease in susceptibility of the parasite to some of the new drugs increased interest in a new idea concerning the future of malaria chemotherapy, one interesting suggestion being the use of some already known drugs in Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) to delay the occurrence of resistance.",

After the validation of a target, the design of specific inhibitors is another time and money consuming step, since it requires a very fine knowledge of the target structure to design specific inhibitors.

The cytostome is an invagination of both parasite and parasitophorous membranes [23]. Currently, there is an active discussion about the role of actin in the formation of this structure [21, 23]. This is due to recent evidence of rab5, a marker associated with endosome formation and transport in eukaryotes [21]. Cytostomes are formed throughout the erythrocytic cell cycle and often many are found in one parasite. Subsequent individualization of small vesicules containing Hb was observed by numerous authors [20\u201322, 24]. These vesicules appear at the ring stage [20] but their importance in Hb uptake becomes more important at the trophozo\u00efte stage [21]. They are transported to the digestive vacuole and finally fuse with it. This process is actin and rab5-dependent. Digestion occurs in these structures because hemozoin can appear in them even if their fusion with the digestive vacuole is inhibited, indicating that they can acquire the necessary enzymes and factors to degrade Hb and to biocrystallize hematin [21, 24].",

Cytostomal tubes were thought to have an important role in Hb uptake by the parasite. Individual digestive vesicles were proposed to either bud off from the terminal portion of the tube or by the individualization of the different portions of the tube itself. Finally, the pigment vesicles were proposed to fuse rapidly to produce a \u201cresidual vacuole,\u201d where malarial pigment was supposed to be sequestrated [24]. Recent observations suggest a direct fuse of cytostomal tube with the food vacuole resulting from the evolution of the \u201cbig gulp\u201d and not by individualization of vesicles [23], but these results are controversial [21]. Cytostomal tubes appear about 30h after erythrocyte invasion and their global volume seems to be small, limiting their role in Hb uptake by the parasite.",

Four aspartic proteases (falcipains), three cysteic proteases (plasmepsins), a metalloprotease (falcilysin), a dipeptidylpeptidase I, and probably aminopeptidases are involved in the digestion of Hb [25]. Hb is primarily attacked by plasmepsins and falcipains and cleaved into smaller fragments. These fragments are hydrolyzed by falcilysin in small peptides, and finally aminoacids were liberated by dipeptidylpeptidase and aminopeptidase. Inhibitors of the falcipain and plasmepsins impair or kill the parasite in vitro and in vivo, but their specificity is not strict. Knockouts experiments on several of these enzymes, individually or in combination, demonstrated that in normal culture conditions P. falciparum is able to acquire the important parts of the aminoacids necessary from its environmental medium (isoleucine, which is absent in Hb is entirely taken up from parasitized RBC outside compartment) as a redundant way with Hb degradation. Such experiments also showed that some proteolytic enzymes have an overlapping role in Hb digestion and, for these reasons, plasmepsins do not represent valuable drug targets [26]. It must be noted that if Hb degradation is strictly necessary for parasite survival [26], it is not restricted to the use of produced amino acids for nutrition, but also to make room for itself [16, 19] and to maintain the osmotic pressure required to avoid lysis of the infected RBC [16, 17]. All enzymes involved in Hb digestion are more active at a pH less than 5. Consequently, the DV is an acidic compartment in the parasite and represents a primary interest in the mechanism of action of many schizontocidal antimalarials.",

            "text": "However, if some doubts are remaining on how \u03b2-hematin is formed in the malaria parasite, recent results have shed light on the mechanisms involved. Among the three proposed hypotheses to explain catalysis or nucleation of the hematin biocrystallization, the role of histidin rich protein 2 (HRP2) [37] is now called into question based on: (1) the localization of the protein and the capability of HRP2 knockout parasites to form pigment [38] and (2) the fact that organisms lacking HRP2 are still able to produce a pigment similar to hemozoin [39]. There is now clear evidence that the formation of hemozoin occurs in a hydrophobic environment within or at the surface of lipids in Plasmodium and in other organisms producing hemozoin [40\u201342]. Experimental works have confirmed this hypothesis [43\u201347], and that the activity of some antimalarials is in clear relation with an interaction with parasite lipids [48]. The intervention of specific enzymes in biocrystallization of hemozoin has been largely discussed since the observation of heme polymerase activity in parasite extracts [49, 50]. The difficulty of purifying a protein showing such activity, the demonstration that biocrystallization could occur in absence of protein [51], and the discovery of the role of lipids have diverted interest for this hypothesis. Recently, the gene of a heme detoxification protein (HDP) was characterized. Both the recombinant protein and the authentic protein purified by immunoprecipitation were shown to interact with heme with high affinity (more than four times that of HRP2) and to catalyze very efficiently the biocrystallization in \u03b2-hematin. The catalytic activity of the protein is optimal at pH 5.2 or lower. After its synthesis, the protein seems to be exported into the infected RBC cytoplasm and is internalized again at the same time as Hb by the parasite. Knockout experiments showed that in P. falciparum, the hdp locus could not be mutated and authors concluded from the results obtained that the gene was certainly critical for parasite survival [52]. This protein appears well conserved within the Plasmodium genus [53]. The fraction of total hemozoin related to HDP activity is still under discussion.",

Nevertheless, it was shown that pfmdr1 amplification and polymorphism were involved, possibly in association with other genetic factors [59], in the modulation of susceptibility to several antimalarials (mefloquine, halofantrine, quinine, and artemisinin) in fields studies, and in transfected parasites [60\u201364].

Starting from these results, Wellems et al. completely dissected the 400kb area suspected to contain chr 7 and finally selected a 47.5kb area containing 13 genes, which were analyzed. The first gene (cg2) postulated to be at the origin of CQ resistance [68] was not confirmed in many epidemiological studies and by transfection experiments [69]. The discovery of a 14th gene (pfcrt) coding for a protein localized in the digestive vacuole membrane and carrying specific mutations in CQ-resistant parasites provided one key capital of CQ resistance [70]. The role of PfCRT protein mutations in CQ resistance was rapidly confirmed on field isolates [71, 72].",

Some authors discuss about the channel nature of the protein [79, 80]. It has been suggested that the change of the charged lysine to uncharged threonine affects the electrostatic interaction with the diprotonated CQ [81]. In the mutated forms, the absence of electrostatic interactions allows the drug to cross the channel (Fig.6). This results in the efflux of the drug out of the DV [81].

The Cooper group [82] demonstrated that mutations in transmembrane domains 1, 4, and 9 altered susceptibility to CQ, quinine, and quinidine. Photoaffinity labeling of PfCRT with a novel perfluorophenylazido CQ [83] provided new information concerning interaction of the drug with the protein. Mutations conferring CQ resistance increased the CQ-associated H+ leak in the parasite digestive vacuole [84]. Recent observations have shown that PfCRT may exert its protective role even in erythrocytic stages when hemoglobin digestion and production of pigment is not very active, as in rings and late schizonts [85]. On the other hand, we should keep in mind that CQ resistance has a biological cost for the parasite. In some geographical areas, the abandonment of CQ use results in resurgence of susceptible phenotypes [86, 87]. As PfCRT is considered by some authors as a metabolite/drug transporter, it can be expected that mutations in such a protein can modify the physiology of parasite. Comparison of transcriptomes of clones carrying wild type PfCRT, with clones carrying a single mutation in the gene showed that the mRNA level from 45 genes was modified compared with the wild type parent. Most of the up-regulated genes are involved in invasion, cell growth and development, signal transduction, and transport activities. Some genes encode proteins involved in transport and/or regulation of cytoplasmic or compartmental pH [88].",

Among all the (fluoro)quinolones active on bacteria and tested against P. falciparum strains (3D7 or NF54-R), none of them showed an activity better than 1\u00b5g/mL (the most active proved to be grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin) [110]. Moreover, several quinolones proved to be active in vitro against CQ-susceptible (D6) and CQ-resistant (Dd2) P. falciparum strains [111, 112].\n",

Whereas most analogs were found to be more active than CQ, they did not present an optimal activity compared with others. For compounds with a benzylcarbamoyl substituent (R), the chain length (n) made no significant difference to the efficacy in D10 CQ-susceptible strain, but a decrease in efficacy with an increase in the length of the methylene spacer was noted in the K1 CQ-resistant strain [120]. Compounds with the Fem group at the end of the side chain showed an activity which decreased rapidly with the level of CQ-resistance among the P. falciparum clones tested. Clearly, a cross resistance could be postulated to emerge very quickly. There was no significant correlation between either the liphophilic character or the in vitro inhibition of hemozoin formation and IC50 values among these CQ analogs [118, 119]. Bis-ferrocenyl conjugates led to erratic activities and impossibility to measure precise IC50 values, mainly due both to stability and solubility problems in culture medium [118, 119]. A decrease of the efficacy was observed between the linear and branched propylamino chain derivatives (Fig.16). Introduction of methyl groups in the side chain was not favorable to the antimalarial activity [118, 119].",

FQ was also the most active derivative in vivo and was considered as a lead compound early on (More details in Sect.3) [121].

In the laboratory, a synthetic method was developed to provide separate pure enantiomers of FQ [126]. The approach included a biocatalytic kinetic resolution using Candida rugosa lipase (C.r.l.). The key step (Fig.22) is enantioselective acetylation of primary hydroxy group leading to the formation of enantiomerically enriched acetate. The remaining untransformed alcohol was isolated in an extremely high enantiomeric excess (ee>98%). The deacylation of the enriched acetate was undertaken by means of a transesterification process catalyzed also by C.r.l. This reaction provides the other alcohol with high enantiomeric purity (ee>98%). Finally, both amino alcohols were oxidized to the corresponding carboxaldehydes and then engaged in the total synthesis of (1\u2032R)-FQ and (1\u2032S)-FQ.\n\n",

Contrary to previous results, introduction of the ferrocene moiety did not increase antimalarial activity.

Subcutaneous administration of FQ to mice infected by P. berghei N, according to the \u201cfour-days blood schizonticidal test\u201d [138], showed that drug IC50 and IC90 values were, respectively, 1.22 and 1.95mg/kg/day as against 1.39 and 2.7mg/kg/day for CQ [129]. More than IC50 tests, curative tests showed the efficacy of CQ, but also the limits of some strains for in vivo tests (unpublished results). We conducted the curative test as the \u201cfour-days blood schizonticidal test,\u201d but in place of parasitemia determination at day 4, mice are monitored for survival throughout a period of 2 months after the end of treatment, with regular controls to verify if mortality is related to parasite infection [126, 129]. Experiments showed that the curative dose for CQ on the P. berghei N strain was 50mg/kg/day (to be compared with the IC90 reported above). Under the same conditions a daily dose of 8.39mg/kg/day of FQ cured 14/15 mice. Similar results were obtained with P. yoelii NS strain, with no curative effect of CQ at 60mg/kg/day vs. 14/30 mice cured with 10mg/kg/day of FQ, 3/3 cured at 15mg/kg/day, and 5/5 cured at 20mg/kg/day (unpublished results). In all these experiments, the last surviving parasites were observed in immature RBC (reticulocytes). The affinity of P. berghei and some P. yoelii strains for immature RBC is well known [139]. To get round this problem, we selected a strain of P. vinckei vinckei which did not invade immature red cells [129]. In these conditions, FQ cured mice equally from CQ-susceptible or CQ resistant P. vinckei strains at a dose of 8.4mg/kg/day whilst CQ cured the CQ sensitive line at 31mg/kg/day and was not curative for CQ resistant line at a subtoxic dose of 58.9mg/kg/day. One promising result was that FQ was equally curative given subcutaneously or orally, which was an indication of its good bioavailability [126, 129].",

The cross reactivity observed in some studies with CQ was limited and it was demonstrated that it was caused by differences in initial parasitemia among isolates at the start of the assays [141]. Independance of susceptibility of P. falciparum with phenotypic variation of pfcrt gene, responsible for CQ resistance, could be suspected from these results, but this was demonstrated at the molecular level on Cambodia isolates [148] and extended further on other genes currently involved in resistance to aminoquinoline antimalarials [89, 90].",

Parasites appearing after 35 days pressure were unable to develop, even in absence of the drug in the medium [148]. Experiments were conducted in vivo on a murine strain of P. yoelii NS and resulted in a multiresistant phenotype (CQ, mefloquine and FQ) with a very low pathogenicity. The strain was able to develop only in immature erythrocytes and maximum parasitemia was about 2%. Mice were very often able to cure themselves from parasites, either under pressure of FQ or in absence of drug. Moreover, FQ resistance was not fixed genetically, in opposition with CQ resistance [146]. Just removing drug pressure resulted in a rapid loss of resistance to FQ, which was already observed on an artemisinin-resistant phenotype of the same species [149]. When the strain under FQ pressure was cryopreserved, it had lost its resistance by the time the mouse was inoculated again. In these two conditions the strain remained resistant to CQ. Analysis of pycrt and pymdr1 did not show mutation compared with the wild type line in critical regions known for phenotypic resistance [146]. This result posed questions not only concerning the potential mechanism of resistance to FQ in Plasmodium, but also on the origin of CQ resistance in P. yoelii. Recent results obtained on P. berghei and concerning the translocation of the gene of a multidrug resistance-associated protein (mrp gene) from chromosome 13/14 to chromosome 8 in the chloroquine resistant strain RC might be an interesting lead for comprehension of mechanisms involved in FQ resistance [150].",

The susceptibility to the drug is not dependant to resistance phenotypes already determined. Experiments to induce resistance in vitro or in vivo show clearly that the fit cost of FQ resistance is extremely high for the parasite and disproves its pathogenicity. Nevertheless, one may keep in mind that resistance or decreased susceptibility occurred for all antimalarials currently used. Such resistance could emerge if FQ were used extensively in the future. One way to decrease or to overcome the risk is to use FQ in an ACT [127], with artesunate, as it is planned during its phase II of clinical assays. Out of all cautions taken to delay the occurrence of resistance, experimental studies remain to be performed to select a clone resistant to FQ. The molecular analysis of such resistance might provide useful tools for monitoring the risk of decreased susceptibility of parasite in area when FQ is used.",

The IC50 of FQ was 0.8, whereas the IC50 of CQ was 1.9. This clearly shows that FQ is a strong inhibitor of \u03b2-hematin formation and even more potent than CQ [128]. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces have been computed at the DFT-B3LYP level of theory for neutral and diprotonated FQ and CQ. In both cases, FQ and CQ show considerable similarity in the quinoline area. Since this part of the molecule is thought to directly interact with hematin by stacking interaction, a similar mode of interaction between these active drugs (FQ or CQ) and hematin was suggested [128].",

In addition, the pK\na values of FQ are lower (pK\na1=8.19 and pK\na2=6.99) than those of CQ (10.03 and 7.94, respectively). As a free base, FQ is more than 100-fold more lipophilic than CQ; this difference may explain the remarkable activity of FQ compared with CQ. Indeed, FQ may target the lipid site of hemozoin formation more efficiently, and thus more powerfully inhibit the process of hemozoin crystallization. To validate or disprove this theory, incubating parasites with [14C] FQ [158] and localizing it by electron microscope autoradiography and subcellular fractionation is envisaged [37].To avoid the use of radioactive material, an alternative method will be to use an electron-dense tracer as ruthenoquine (the ruthenium analog of FQ) to study its uptake by ultrastructural studies of treated parasites.",

When in solution with a low dielectric constant (chloroform, k=5.5) such as the lipid environment, NMR data show that the spatial structure of FQ is much the same as in the crystal [159].

Additional spin trapping experiments demonstrate that CQ is not able to produce OH\u2022 radicals by itself in the presence of H2O2 at the acidic pH of the parasite DV. On the contrary, using the same experimental conditions, hydroxyl radicals are produced by FQ at micromolar concentration [161].

Due to its physicochemical properties, FQ could specifically target the lipid site of hemozoin formation. Its mechanism of action should be in part similar to that of CQ, based on the inhibition of hemozoin formation. Upon the specific (acidic and oxidizing) DV conditions, production of radical oxygen species (ROS) by FQ should be sufficient to promote significant damage on membranes of the parasite DV. The strong activity of FQ on CQ-resistant clones and isolates of P. falciparum suggests a fundamental difference in interaction with resistance mechanisms of the parasite.\n",

The attempts to insert an organometallic moiety in already known antimalarials were based on the idea to improve their activity or to overcome the resistance of the parasite to the parent drug. Results remained, for most of them, within expectations, except for CQ analogs and the serendipitous discovery of FQ. The extensive structure\u2013activity studies, realized on the ferrocenic CQ conjugates, provided important information about the role of the ferrocene core in antimalarial activity. The position of the ferrocenyl moiety in the lateral side chain of CQ was probed with precision. The results formed the basis for new ideas and quinine, melfoquine, and artemisinin were derivatised. The influence of the ferrocenyl moietyl on the lipophilicity is really important when considering that an antimalarial drug has to cross at least three membranes before reaching the parasite cytoplasm and five to six membranes to reach the inner part of the parasite mitochondria or the plastid. The fine analysis of FQ properties led to the underlining of the possible specific role of the ferrocene core in the antimarial activity via the production of hydroxyl radicals. The presence of a specific intramolecular hydrogen bond in the molecule seems to be an important factor for its activity. It was postulated that this weak interaction confers to FQ a potency to interact with membrane lipids and to be specifically present at the site of action when it can be the most efficient. The insertion of the ferrocene moiety in the weak base CQ undoubtedly increased its ability to target the parasite digestive vacuole and possibly enables the drug to escape the resistance mechanisms.",
