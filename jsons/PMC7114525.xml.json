            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an acute contagious diarrhea disease caused in pigs (Song and Park, 2012, Jung et al., 2014). The virus belongs to genus Alpha-coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, which includes other genera; Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-coronavirus, and has positive-sense single stranded RNA genome with envelope (Woo et al., 2012). PEDV is transmitted mainly through the fecal-oral route, infecting all age groups of pigs but the most severe form of diseases occurs in suckling piglets (Song and Park, 2012). In 2013, PEDV was reported for the first time in North American and now PEDVs are present in all of swine producing countries (Song and Park, 2012, Huang et al., 2013, Mole, 2013). In Korea, PEDV was first reported in 1992 (Kweon et al., 1993), and continuingly circulated and exhibited significant genetic diversity (Choi et al., 2014, Lee and Lee, 2014). PED outbreaks re-occurred in Korea in 2013, however, it was demonstrated that the emerging PEDVs were not variants of old Korean isolates or attenuated vaccine strains (Chung et al., 2015). Though a recent publication characterized the genetic evolution of PEDVs in Korea from 1998 to 2013, to our knowledge, the transmission patterns of the virus in Korea are largely unknown. Using a large dataset collected globally and locally, this study aimed to trace the spatial-temporal dynamics of PEDVs in Korea.",

Additionally, this study sequenced complete S genes from PEDV positive samples which were stored in our laboratory from October 2012 to March 2015. To infer the spatial-temporal diffusion history of PEDV, sequences of the S gene which had known collection date and country of origin were achieved from Genbank. Overall, the final dataset contained 805 sequences originating from Asia (China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan), Europe (Belgium, Slovenia, France), and American (USA, Canada, Mexico, Colombia), and covering a sampling period from 1986 to 2015. The details of the dataset are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.",

In brief, the spatial diffusion of the time-scaled genealogy is modeled as a standard continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) process over discrete sampling locations. A Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach, which allows the exchange rates in the CTMC to be zero with some prior probability, was used to find a parsimonious set of rates explaining the diffusions in the phylogeny. The analysis was performed using BEAST package v1.8.2 under assumptions of (i) a codon based SRD06 nucleotide substitution model, (ii) a constant population size for the coalescent prior, and (iii) the molecular clock model of uncorrelated lognormal distribution. The analysis was run for 100 million chains, sampling every 10,000 generations.",

The serum neutralizing test (SN test) was conducted using the previous method (Song et al., 2007), with some modifications. In brief, sera of pigs (n = 25) were heat inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use. The sera were serially two- fold diluted. Subsequently either BM3 (a recent PEDV isolate) or DR13 (PED vaccine strain) of 200 TCID50/0.1 ml were mixed at equal volume of the diluted sera. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, 0.1 ml of each virus-serum mixture was infected to monolayer of Vero cells. The presence/absence of CPE were monitored daily for 5 days. The SN titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution which resulted in the inhibition of CPE.",

For the Korean PEDVs of G1, the viruses were found spanning from 1997 until 2012. Meanwhile, the viruses of G2 (G2b and G2a) were detected from 2008 until 2015. As shown in Fig. 1, it was clear that the root of Korean G1 and G2b viruses were inferred to be originated from Korea, while the recent Korean PEDVs were derived from China and USA. The result implied that the transmission histories of PEDVs in Korea were diverse, which reflecting both the continuingly circulation of classical G1 and the introduction of the recent pandemic G2a.

The average titer of the DR13 (14.53 value) was 5 times more than that of the BM3 (2.9 value). The results implied that, the specific antibodies invoked by PED vaccine of G1 inefficiently conferred cross neutralizing activities to the pandemic G2a isolate. Our result was inline with the previous report (Kim et al., 2015) that suggests that limited cross-reactivity was detected between PED vaccine (of genogroup 1) and field viruses (of genogroup 2). The attenuated PEDV vaccines based on the CV777 strains or DR13-derived strains might be antigenically less related to the newly emergent PEDV strains; thus, the development of new vaccines based on current strains are needed (Chen et al., 2014, Chung et al., 2015, Park et al., 2014, Song and Park, 2012, Tian et al., 2013).",

While classical G1 was continuingly circulating between provinces of Korea, the pandemic G2a were recently introduced from China and USA. By the application of Bayesian phylogeographical analysis, this study demonstrated the spatial- temporal transmission of PEDVs within Korea. Of the recent emerged G2a viruses, J3142 strains showed potential recombination breakpoint (376\u20132,143nt) of S1 gene between KNU1303_Korea strain_G2a (KJ451046) and 45RWVCF0712_Thailand strain_G2b (KF724935). The pandemic G2a virus was partial neutralized by the antibodies invoked by the G1- based PED vaccine virus.",
