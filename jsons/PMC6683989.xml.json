            "text": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are the most common liver-tropic viruses in humans. HAV and HEV typically cause an acute form of hepatitis, whereas HBV and HCV frequently cause chronic hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006). HEV may also cause chronic infection (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006; European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2017). In rare cases, primary infections with these viruses, particularly for HAV, HBV, and HEV, can lead to fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH; Liu et al., 2001; European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2017). FVH is defined as severe liver destruction in the absence of preexisting liver disease, leading to encephalopathy within 8 wk of the onset of the first symptoms (Liu et al., 2001; European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2017). It typically strikes children or young adults who are otherwise healthy, with normal immunity to other viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The actual prevalence and incidence of FVH worldwide are not precisely known, but previous studies have suggested that FVH develops in \u22640.5% of individuals with symptomatic HAV infection (Lemon et al., 2017), with an estimated 1.5 million cases worldwide annually (Lemon et al., 2017). The global incidence of FVH due to HAV has therefore been estimated at \u223c1/1,000,000 per year, corresponding to a probable prevalence of 1/100,000. Patients with FVH have a very poor prognosis, with <25% surviving in the absence of liver transplantation. However, survival rates may reach 80% after liver transplantation (Lemon et al., 2017). FVH is typically sporadic, as opposed to epidemic, suggesting that it is not caused by a new more virulent viral strain (Fujiwara et al., 2001; Sasb\u00f3n et al., 2010; Ajmera et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Rare familial cases of FVH have been reported, including two young siblings from a Turkish family, three young brothers from an Iranian family, and two elderly brothers from a Japanese family who developed FVH within weeks of each other following primary HAV infections in their siblings (Durst et al., 2001; Yalniz et al., 2005; Yoshida et al., 2017). In all three families, several relatives of the patients had presented viral hepatitis with a benign course. Inbred strains of mice display differences in susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3; Wege et al., 1982). Upon infection with MHV3, fully susceptible strains (e.g., C57Bl/6J) die from FVH, semisusceptible strains (e.g., C3H/St) develop acute and then chronic hepatitis, and fully resistant strains (e.g., A/J) display no signs of liver disease (MacPhee et al., 1985). These observations suggest that host genetic factors may underlie FVH. The lack of FVH in patients with any of the >350 known primary immunodeficiencies (Picard et al., 2018) suggests that FVH is unlikely to result from inborn errors that broadly disrupt innate and/or adaptive immunity. Instead, previous discoveries that other severe viral diseases striking otherwise healthy individuals, such as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, fulminant EBV disease, herpes simplex encephalitis, severe pulmonary influenza, severe rhinovirus respiratory disease, and severe varicella zoster virus disease, can result from single-gene inborn errors of protective immunity to specific viruses in specific cell types or tissues (Casanova, 2015a,b; Casanova and Abel, 2018) suggest that FVH may result from inborn errors selectively disrupting immunity to hepatitis viruses in the liver. We tested this hypothesis by searching for genetic etiologies of FVH by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a small cohort of patients.",

WES revealed a high rate of homozygosity among the siblings (5.60\u20136.51%), indicating that this family was consanguineous. We therefore hypothesized that a genetic etiology for FVH in this family would display autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance with complete penetrance. We thus searched for very rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.001) homozygous nonsynonymous variants present in the patient but not in her two siblings (Table S1). Six genes had variants meeting these criteria (Table S2). We prioritized candidate genes for further studies based on (i) the known function of the gene in the liver and/or immunity and (ii) the predicted deleteriousness of the variations. IL18BP, encoding the IL-18 binding protein, was the most plausible disease-causing gene, as (i) it encodes a constitutively secreted, naturally circulating neutralizer of the cytokine IL-18 (Aizawa et al., 1999; Novick et al., 1999), the mouse orthologue of which is known to be toxic to the liver (Okamura et al., 1995), and (ii) the patient carried a 40-nt homozygous deletion centered on an intron\u2013exon boundary within this gene. None of the other five variants identified, all of which were missense, had ever been associated with the liver or with immunity (Table S3). Moreover, the IL18BP variant (NG_029021.1:g.7854_7893del; NM_173042.2:c.508-19_528del) was not found in any public database (1000 Genomes, dbSNP, Genome Aggregation Database [GnomAD], or Bravo) or in our in-house database of >4,000 exomes, including 65 from unrelated Algerians and \u22651,000 from North Africans (as confirmed by principal component analysis, as in our patient).",

            "text": "We confirmed by Sanger sequencing that the familial segregation of the mutant IL18BP allele was consistent with an AR mode of inheritance with complete penetrance, as both parents and one of the healthy siblings were heterozygous for the mutation, whereas the other sibling did not carry the mutation (Fig. 1, A and B). This mutation, c.508-19_528del, deletes 19 nt from the fourth and last intron and 21 contiguous nt from the fifth and last exon (Fig. 1 B). It is predicted, in silico, to be highly deleterious, with a combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score of 28.2 (Kircher et al., 2014), which is above the mutation significance cutoff (MSC) score of 12.2 for IL18BP (Itan et al., 2016; Fig. 1 C). IL18BP has a gene damage index (GDI) of 2.05 (Itan et al., 2015), indicating a moderate level of accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in the general population. Indeed, GnomAD includes only four missense variants (p.V23I, p.R121Q, p.P184L, and p.Q192H) in the homozygous state. Their CADD scores range from 0.001 to 23.3 (Fig. 1 C). Two substitutions, p.R121Q and p.Q192H, are common among Africans, with MAFs of 8.23 and 3.11%, respectively, and the patient was also found to be homozygous for p.R121Q. The other two missense variants, p.V23I and p.P184L, have a global MAF <0.1% (Fig. 1 C). Finally, none of the databases included copy number variations encompassing IL18BP in the homozygous state. Collectively, these findings suggested that homozygosity for the private and probably deleterious c.508-19_528del allele in IL18BP may be the underlying cause of FVH in this patient.",

            "text": "The canonical IL18BP transcript (NM_173042) contains five exons in total, encoding a protein of 194 aa, also annotated as IL-18BPa, with an N-terminal signal peptide (1\u201330 aa) and an Ig-like domain (31\u2013166 aa) responsible for binding to IL-18 (Fig. 1 D). The c.508-19_528del mutation, which encompasses the last 19 nt of intron 4 and the first 21 nt of exon 5 (encoding aa 170\u2013194), is predicted to impair the splicing of the last exon, thereby affecting the Ig-like domain and the C-terminal part of IL-18BP (Fig. 1 D). We investigated the impact of this deletion on IL18BP expression in available material from the patient and other family members. Leukocyte gDNA and liver tissue sections were the only materials available for the deceased patient. In quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses with different probes detecting various IL-18BPa transcript variants, we found that IL18BP mRNA levels in heterozygous EBV-transformed B cells (EBV-B cells) from a sibling and both parents were \u223c50% lower than those in homozygous WT cells from another sibling and healthy controls (Figs. 2 A and S1 A). This suggested that c.508-19_528del was loss-of-expression at the mRNA level. We then amplified the 3\u2032 end of the IL18BP cDNA, to determine whether the c.508-19_528del allele generated novel splice variants in the EBV-B cells of the heterozygous sibling (Figs. 2 B and S1 B). We detected three new polyadenylated transcript variants (M1\u2013M3) that also carried the cis p.R121Q mutation (Fig. 2 C). We confirmed these findings through the transient expression of IL18BP exons with a 3\u2032 terminal exon-trapping vector (pTAG4) in COS7 cells (Fig. S1, C\u2013E). In particular, M1 and M2 seemed to have no stop codons before the polyadenylation site. However, qPCR on EBV-B cells from WT controls and heterozygous family members showed that all mutant variants were barely detectable and present in much smaller amounts than the WT form (Fig. 2 D). These findings confirmed that c.508-19_528del results in a skipping of the initial sequences of exon 5, without leakiness, and the generation of three novel IL18BP transcripts with a shorter terminal exon. Two of these new transcripts have no stop codon, and all three are rapidly degraded. These data suggest that the patient had AR complete IL-18BP deficiency.",

Human IL-18BP migrates at 25\u201345 kD on SDS-PAGE gels in reducing conditions, due to heterogeneous glycosylation (Kim et al., 2000; Fig. 2 E). We detected abnormal expression of the mutant isoforms (M1\u2013M3) in transiently transfected COS7 cells. M1 and M2 migrated at \u223c45 kD, displaying more consistent glycosylation than the WT, whereas M3 had a lower molecular weight but a similar glycosylation pattern to the WT (Figs. 2 E and S1 F). We then analyzed protein production from the four nonsynonymous IL18BP alleles found in the homozygous state in GnomAD (the common variants p.R121Q and p.Q192H and the rare variants p.V23I and p.P184L). The pattern of expression of these variants with a C-terminal 6x-His tag in COS7 cells was similar to that of the WT (Figs. 2 F and S1 G). We investigated the functional impact of all variants by an in vitro IL-18BP bioassay in which human IL-18BP inhibits the IL-12/IL-18\u2013induced production of IFN-\u03b3 by the natural killer (NK)\u201392 cell line (Kim et al., 2000; Fig. S1 H). We compared the activity of WT and mutant IL-18BP obtained from the concentrated supernatants of COS7 cells transfected with empty vector, WT, or mutant IL-18BP constructs. All four missense proteins had normal IL-18\u2013inhibiting activity, whereas M1, M2, and M3 did not block IL-18 activity at all (Fig. 2 G). Similar results were obtained for the mutant constructs (M1\u2013M3) generated with or without the common missense allele (p.R121Q) carried by the patient (Fig. S1, I\u2013K). Overall, the c.508-19_528del allele encodes barely detectable M1, M2, and M3 isoforms, all of which lack IL-18\u2013neutralizing function, probably due to their altered protein expression, in terms of pattern and molecular weight. These findings indicate that the patient had AR complete IL-18BP deficiency, whereas individuals from the general population carrying homozygous IL18BP variants had normal IL-18BP expression and function. These findings suggest that AR IL-18BP deficiency is exceedingly rare in the general population and that AR IL-18BP deficiency is probably the cause of FVH in this patient.",

We analyzed the expression patterns of IL-18, IL-18BP, and the two chains of IL-18R, IL-18R1 and IL-18RAP, in several human cell lines acting as surrogates of liver-resident cells: Hep3B (hepatocytes), HUVECs (endothelial cells), LX-2 (hepatic stellate cells), SV40 fibroblasts, THP1 (monocytes), NKL (NK cells), Jurkat (T cells), and Raji (B cells) cells. We assessed mRNA and protein levels at baseline and following stimulation with various inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03bb, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-15, IL-18, IL-22, and IL-27 (Figs. S2 and S3). We found that THP1 cells were major producers of IL-18, whereas IL-18 was either present at very low levels or undetectable in other cell types (Fig. S2, A and B). IL-18BP was constitutively expressed only in THP1 and Jurkat cells, and was markedly up-regulated by stimulation with IFN-\u03b3, particularly in Hep3B, SV40 fibroblasts, HUVECs, and LX-2 cells (Fig. S2, C and D). Moreover, IFN-\u03b1 or IL-27 also increased IL-18BP production, albeit to a much lesser extent (Fig. S2, C and D). Of note, we did not detect rare alternative splicing forms of IL18BP, namely IL18BPb, IL18BPc, or IL18BPd (Novick et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000), in HepG2 (hepatocyte) cells, THP1 cells, or primary human hepatocytes, as previously reported to be absent in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; Veenstra et al., 2002; data not shown). Finally, we found that both chains of IL-18R were expressed principally in NKL cells (Fig. S2, E and F; and Fig. S3). These observations, consistent with previous reports (Lebel-Binay et al., 2000), suggest that IL-18 is mostly produced by macrophages in the liver, and that it induces IFN-\u03b3 production, particularly by NK cells, which in turn triggers intrahepatic IL-18BP secretion, mostly from hepatocytes and macrophages. Thus, IL-18BP, which is induced strongly by IFN-\u03b3, can buffer intrahepatic IL-18 activity through negative feedback.",

We thus performed immunohistochemical staining on liver sections from the IL-18BP\u2013deficient patient described in this study, an unrelated patient with FVH due to HAV, and an individual without liver inflammation. Only very small numbers of hepatocytes were detected in the liver tissues of the two FVH patients (Figs. 3 and S4). However, the IL-18BP\u2013deficient patient and the unrelated FVH patient had higher proportions of T cells (CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+), perforin-positive cells (attributed to CD8+ T and NK cells), NK cells (CD57+ or NKp46+), B cells (CD20+), M1 and M2 (CD68+) macrophages, and M2 (CD163+) macrophages than the control individual (Figs. 3 and S4). These observations indicate a massive loss of hepatocytes and inflammatory cell accumulation in the livers of FVH patients. Moreover, the IL-18 staining was abnormally high in the liver tissues of FVH patients. This cytokine was detected in both macrophages and hepatocytes in these patients, whereas it was barely detectable overall and found only in macrophages in healthy liver sections (Figs. 3 and S4). IL-18BP was not detected in liver sections from controls or patients (data not shown; Materials and methods). Collectively, these data suggest that, in baseline conditions, IL-18 is produced mostly by macrophages in the liver, but that hepatocytes also produce IL-18 during viral infection.",

Moreover, IL-18, together with IL-2, enhances the activation and in vitro cytotoxic activity of human peripheral NK cells (Son et al., 2001; Nielsen et al., 2016). IL-2\u2013stimulated human liver NK cells have also been shown to be strongly cytotoxic, even more so than peripheral blood NK cells, to human HepG2 hepatocytes (Ishiyama et al., 2006). We therefore generated an in vitro model to test IL-18/IL-18BP\u2013regulated hepatotoxicity through the coculture of HepG2 and NK-92 cells, which display a phenotype similar to liver-resident NK cells in humans (Le Bouteiller et al., 2002). NK cells activated with IL-18 killed significantly more hepatocytes than unstimulated NK cells at various NK-cell-to-hepatocyte ratios (Fig. S5, A\u2013C). As expected, IL-18BP completely rescued IL-18\u2013induced NK cell\u2013mediated hepatotoxicity (Fig. S5, A\u2013C). We also showed that IL-18, together with IL-2, increased in vitro cytotoxicity of PBMCs from healthy donors against HepG2 cells, and that IL-18BP could prevent the IL-18\u2013induced toxicity (Fig. S5 D). Finally, we infected HepG2 or Huh7.5 hepatocytes with HAV (Fig. S5 E; Materials and methods). We showed that IL-18\u2013activated NK cells killed both infected and uninfected hepatocytes, and that this cytotoxicity was reversed by the addition of IL-18BP (Fig. 4, A and B). Overall, these findings support a model in which the genetically determined absence of IL-18BP in the patient with FVH by HAV leads to uncontrolled IL-18\u2013mediated cytotoxic activity against hepatocytes, involving NK and T cells, the most abundant lymphocytes in the liver, in particular, thereby exacerbating liver destruction (Fig. 4 C).",

            "text": "We have established a causal relationship between AR complete IL-18BP deficiency and lethal FVH due to HAV in an 11-yr-old child without preexisting liver disease and with no history of severe infection. Causality is established on both genetic and mechanistic grounds, meeting the criteria for genetic studies in single patients (Casanova et al., 2014). In contrast, it is unclear if the two autoimmune phenotypes of the patient, type I diabetes and Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, are also due to IL-18BP deficiency. The child had AR complete IL-18BP deficiency, and there are \u22642.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 such patients in the general population. IL-18 is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine that was initially discovered in mouse liver and has been reported to activate NK cells and T cells in addition to its potent IFN-\u03b3\u2013inducing activity (Kaplanski, 2018). Serum and hepatic concentrations of IL-18 and IFN-\u03b3 were high in patients with various forms of fulminant liver failure (Yumoto et al., 2002; Shinoda et al., 2006). In particular, serum IL-18 was found to be dramatically elevated in patients with acute hepatitis due to HAV infection (Kim et al., 2018). Moreover, mouse IL-18 has been shown to induce intrahepatic inflammatory cell recruitment and severe hepatotoxicity in various liver injury models (Tsutsui et al., 2000; Finotto et al., 2004; Kimura et al., 2011), whereas IL-18BP has been shown to protect against IL-18\u2013mediated fulminant hepatitis in mice (Faggioni et al., 2001; Fantuzzi et al., 2003; Shao et al., 2013). Our findings indicate that uncontrolled IL-18 activity in humans is toxic to the liver, as previously demonstrated in mice, and that human IL-18BP is a potent liver-protective compound, acting as an antidote to IL-18. Recombinant human IL-18BP (Tadekinig Alfa; AB2 Bio) has been approved for clinical use for indications unrelated to liver conditions and proposed as a treatment for preventing acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (Bachmann et al., 2018). We provide proof-of-principle that FVH can be caused by single-gene inborn errors of immunity to HAV in the liver. Our findings also reveal the essential functions of IL-18 and IL-18BP in humans. By inference from previous human genetic study of other isolated infections, which are characterized by genetic heterogeneity but physiological homogeneity (Casanova, 2015a,b; Israel et al., 2017; Tangye et al., 2017; de Jong et al., 2018; Hernandez et al., 2018; Mart\u00ednez-Barricarte et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018), there might be other genetic etiologies of FVH that impair IL-18BP or enhance IL-18 activity. Furthermore, neutralizing endogenous IL-18, particularly with recombinant IL-18BP, might be beneficial to patients with FVH caused by HAV and possibly other viruses.",

Tests for anti\u2013islet cell and anti-insulin autoantibodies were positive, but no anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were detected (Table S4). In 2009, anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies were detected, but tests for anti-glutaminase, anti-endomysium, and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies were negative. Celiac disease was therefore excluded. In 2011, the patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis, and tests for anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies were positive (Table S4). The patient was treated with levothyroxine. In 2013, the patient presented with fatigue, nausea, and hepatomegaly. She tested positive for HAV IgM on presentation, consistent with primary HAV infection. Serology and PCR results were negative for HBV (other than the presence of anti-HBs due to prior vaccination), HCV, or HEV. The patient was seropositive for CMV and EBV and negative for HIV and HTLV1 and 2. PCR tests for enterovirus were negative. No liver autoantibodies (anti-NA, anti-SMA, anti-LKM1, anti-LC1, anti-SLA, or anti-mitochondria) were detected, excluding autoimmune hepatitis. The patient had no history of exposure to hepatotoxic drugs, and screening tests for such drugs were negative. Liver function tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2,181 IU/liter; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 2,582 IU/liter; \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 73 IU/liter; total bilirubin, 274 \u03bcmol/liter; conjugated bilirubin, 173 \u03bcmol/liter; prothrombin time (PT), 67%; and Factor V, 100% (Table S5). On day 8 of infection, the patient was hospitalized for incoherent speech, jaundice, appetite loss, gingival bleeding, and petechiae. During physical examination at the emergency unit, the patient was unconscious, with icterus, hepatomegaly, and a fever (40\u00b0C). The patient was diagnosed with FVH due to HAV infection. On day 9, liver function tests revealed high levels of cytolysis, with a PT of 14%, factor V levels at 30%, and a Glasgow coma scale score of 8 (Table S5). The patient underwent liver transplantation but died a day later of multiple organ failure (day 11). Histological examinations of the native and explanted liver showed 95% hepatocellular necrosis with polymorphic inflammation. The patient had been vaccinated against BCG, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcus, flu, HBV, and MMR with no adverse effects. She was not tested for immunodeficiency. Her polymorphonuclear cell counts were consistently in the normal range (Table S6).",

Only indel-inframe, indel-frameshift, start-lost, missense, nonsense, stop-lost, and essential splice-site (splice acceptor and splice donor) variants were retained for further analysis. Given the rare occurrence of FVH in children, we excluded common polymorphisms with an AF of \u22650.1% in public databases: EVS, 1000 Genomes, and GnomAD, including variants with an AF \u22650.1% in each ethnic subpopulation (African, Ashkenazi Jewish, Finnish, non-Finnish European, South Asian, East Asian, and Latino) in GnomAD. In silico predictions of the impact of variants were evaluated with the following algorithms: GDI (http://pec630.rockefeller.edu:8080/GDI/; Itan et al., 2015), CADD (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score; Kircher et al., 2014), and MSC (http://pec630.rockefeller.edu:8080/MSC/; Itan et al., 2016).

Briefly, cDNA was synthesized with an adapter primer (AP-1) and SuperScript II Reverse transcription (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from total RNA isolated from the EBV-B cells of a healthy control and the patients\u2019 siblings. The first PCR amplification of 3\u2032 partial cDNA ends was performed with a forward primer (FEx1) specific to IL18BP exon 1 and a universal amplification primer (UAP)-1 binding to AP-1. The PCR products were purified and used for nested PCR with an IL18BP-specific primer (FEx1-2) spanning the junction of exons 1 and 2 and an abridged UAP. The final amplicons generated from the WT and heterozygous sibling samples were ligated into the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega), and the colonies were sequenced. For in vitro 3\u2032 terminal exon-trapping experiments, 1,558-bp DNA fragments starting with a 3\u2032-fragment of IL18BP intron 3 (43 bp) were amplified from the gDNA samples of the WT sibling and the patient, with pTAG4-IL18BP forward and reverse primers. These fragments were between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pTAG4 vector. The pTAG4 exon-trapping vector (Krizman and Berget, 1993) was kindly provided by Dr. Anders Lade Nielsen (Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark). COS7 cells were transfected with one WT and one mutant clone in the presence of X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche). After 16 h, total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), treated with DNase (Turbo DNA-free Kit; Invitrogen), and used for cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) and an adapter primer (AP-2; Blechingberg et al., 2007). The first PCR was performed with a specific primer (FAD1-2) spanning the junction of AD exons 1 and 2, and the UAP-2, which binds to AP-2 (Blechingberg et al., 2007). This reaction was followed by nested PCR with a specific primer (FAD2-Ex4) encompassing the junction of AD exon 2 and IL18BP exon 4 and a reverse primer (RUTR) binding to the end of the IL18BP 3\u2032 UTR. The nested PCR products were inserted into the pGEM-T-Easy vector, and the colonies were sequenced. Successful and equivalent cDNA synthesis was confirmed by the amplification by PCR of HPRT1, as the housekeeping gene control. SnapGene was used to analyze the DNA sequences of the clones. All clones carrying PCR artifacts or sequences not matching the IL18BP canonical transcript were excluded from subsequent analyses. Digital images were captured by the Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences). The primer sequences are provided in Table S7.",

The forward primer (IL18BP BamHI) included a BamHI site and a Kozak consensus sequence, whereas the reverse primer (IL18BP-His XbaI) contained an in-frame coding sequence for a C-terminal 6x-His tag and an XbaI site. SDM to generate the IL18BP variants present in GnomAD (p.V23I, p.R121Q, and p.P184L) was performed by a modified overlap-extension PCR-based method (Shimada, 1996). IL18BP BamHI/SDM-reverse primers and SDM-forward/IL18BP-His XbaI primers were used to amplify the mutated IL18BP in two separate reactions, using the pEF-BOS-EX-IL18BP-His WT plasmid as the template. Each PCR product was were purified, and the different products were mixed without primers for overlap-extension PCR. SDM for the p.Q192H allele was performed by one-step PCR with the IL18BP BamHI and Q192H-His-XbaI primers. Novel IL18BP transcript variants (M1, M2, and M3) were generated with the IL18BP BamHI and SDM-reverse primers or the SDM-forward and mutant reverse primers (containing an in-frame coding sequence for a C-terminal 6x-His tag, a stop codon, and an XbaI site) in two separate reactions, using the pEF-BOS-EX-IL18BP-His WT plasmid and control gDNA, respectively, as templates. The M1 and M2 transcripts were cloned including an 18-nt polyadenylation insert upstream of the 6x-His tag, followed by a stop codon. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primer sequences are provided in Table S7.",

This long immersion in formalin may be responsible for alteration of some epitopes and for increased background signals when performing immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the most efficient kits available for immunohistochemistry include a streptavidin-biotin amplification step. This may also explain the increased background signals during immunohistochemistry staining, as hepatocytes contain endogenous biotin. Although IL-18BP staining was validated on control transfected cell lines, the staining observed in healthy or diseased livers was not significantly different from the staining detected with the diluent without the primary antibody as negative control (unpublished data).
