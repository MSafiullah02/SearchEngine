            "text": "The basic unit of life is the cell, with the capacities of genetic heredity and evolution as unique hallmarks. For centuries, biology has been the science of life focused on the analysis of the microscopic (membranes, cells, tissues, etc.) and macroscopic (insects, animals, plants, etc.) worlds, but it has gradually adopted synthesis as a means to understand biological systems since the late 19th century. In 1899, for instance, in a manner that is reminiscent of today\u2019s media, the Boston Herald newspaper reported sensationally the work of the US-German biologist Jacques Loeb as the \u201ccreation of life\u201d (Ball 2010). Loeb (1899) is known for his invention of artificial parthenogenesis: embryonic development was induced by treating sea urchin eggs with inorganic salts. Loeb conceived of living organisms as chemical machines, and he aimed for a synthetic science of life capable of forming new combinations from the elements of living nature, similar to the way in which an engineer sees his work, as practical, useful and controlled (Fangerau 2009). If we also recall the \u201cSynthetic method to understand life\u201d by the French professor in medicine, St\u00e9phane Leduc (1853\u20131939), the \u201cCreation of new species by experimental evolution\u201d by the Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries (1848\u20131935), or the \u201cSynthetic new species by genetic engineering\u201d by the American botanist Albert Blakeslee (1874\u20131954), we can see that ideas of \u201csynthetic life\u201d resounded as early as the 1930s (Campos 2009).",

By the 1980s, synthetic biology was defined as \u201cthe synthesis of artificial forms of life\u201d (Hobom 1980), but it also was considered synonymous to \u201cbioengineering\u201d by some scientists (Benner and Sismour 2005). During the 1990s, while \u201cdesigning synthetic molecules\u201d (Rawls 2000) became a common practice biological research especially in the US, the field of metabolic engineering was emerging (Bailey et al. 1990). From a historical perspective, synthetic biology has been evolving from an old genetic (one gene) era towards a younger metabolic (two or more genes) phase, followed by a current genome (dozens of genes) engineering era that will drive us to a \u201cbiosystems engineering\u201d (more than one organism) future (Carr and Church 2009).",

Since then biology increasingly depends on computers and mathematics for analysing huge amounts of DNA sequencing data (Shendure and Ji 2008). But it was not until the new millennium that the contemporary field of synthetic biology re-emerged from a community of engineers interested in biology. Their migration into biology (Brent 2004) has enabled the application of \u201cengineering principles\u201d like design, modelling, abstraction and modularity of \u201ccircuits\u201d in living systems for useful purposes (Endy 2005). The culmination of synthetic biology as an \u201cengineering\u201d discipline has been considered by some bioengineers to be in 2004 during the first international meeting of the BioBricks Foundation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, USA (Heinemann and Panke 2009).",

These efforts rest on the idea about the existence of a universal minimal genome that gave rise to all living beings based on the assumption of a unique origin of cellular life, the so-called Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) (Ouzounis and Kyrpides 1996). However, recent research points to the possibility that the tree of life composed of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (Eubacteria and Archaea) emerged from a community of primordial cells rather than from a single cell (Kim and Caetano-Anolles 2012). Therefore, while the Holy Grail-like quest for the \u201cminimal genome\u201d has become elusive, eliminating many non-essential functions compromises the fitness of an organism and results in \u201cfragile\u201d genomes (Acevedo-Rocha et al. 2013a).",

To achieve this, three important principles of self-organization are taken into consideration: reproduction, replication, and assembly. Reproduction (Sole et al. 2007) refers to the ability of a system to reproduce a similar copy of itself: cells (composed of container and metabolism) or \u201chardwares\u201d reproduce; whereas replication (Paul and Joyce 2004) happens when a system replicates an exact copy of itself: the genetic program (such as DNA) or \u201csoftware\u201d is copied. Assembly occurs upon aggregation of vesicles or containers (e.g., Oparin\u2019s coacervates) made of small droplets of organic molecules like lipids (Vasas et al. 2012) or liposomes, membrane-like structures containing phospholipids (Oberholzer and Luisi 2002).",

In some of these collaborations biologists and engineers work together with computer scientists to develop the next generation computer aided design (CAD) software for engineering-based synthetic biology (MacDonald et al. 2011). In summary, the main goal of bioengineers is to predict the behaviour of living systems for the sake of safety applications, as Drew Endy says:Engineers hate complexity. I hate emergent properties.

One strategy uses orthogonal enzymes and a transfer RNA adaptor from an unrelated organism to incorporate a given unnatural, noncanonical or xeno amino acid (XAA) into one or more proteins at one or more specific sites (Budisa 2014). The orthogonal enzymes are generated by \u201cdirected evolution\u201d, a method that consists of repeated cycles of gene mutagenesis (genotypic diversity generation), screening or selection (of a particular phenotypic trait), and amplification of an improved variant for the next iterative round (Reetz 2013). Dozens of XAAs have been successfully incorporated into proteins in bacteria, yeast and human cell lines (Liu and Schultz 2010), but also in more complex organisms like worms and flies (Chin 2014). Directed evolution also enables the development of orthogonal ribosomes (based on canonical DNA sequence changes) to facilitate the incorporation of XAAs into proteins (Wang et al. 2007) or of \u201cmirror life\u201d, i.e., biological systems endowed with biomolecules composed of enantiomers of opposite chirality (Renders and Pinheiro 2015; Zhao and Lu 2014).",

In 1972, Berg combined DNA from the gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli and the Simian Virus 40 in an exogenous plasmid or vector (Jackson et al. 1972). The following year Cohen demonstrated that DNA from the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus could be introduced and stably propagated into E. coli (Chang and Cohen 1974). This experiment gave rise to the first GMO. The next year, Cohen and Boyer reported the creation of the first E. coli endowed with a transgene originally from the South African clawed frog Xenopus (Cohen 2013), resulting in the first transgenic organism. By using plasmids as gene vectors, these proof-of-principle studies showed that genetic material could be transferred not only between closely related species but also across unrelated ones.",

Artemisinin is chemically known as a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, the drug of choice to treat malaria, preferentially in combination with other derivatives. Every year, 500 million people become infected with this disease, and 1 million persons die of it in the developing world, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Every 30 s, on average, a child dies from malaria worldwide. Artemisinin is obtained from the leaves of the plant Artemisia annua, also known as sweet wormwood. Using its leaves, a simple tea used to be prepared to treat fever, including malaria, in the traditional Chinese medicine but it was not until the 1970s that it was rediscovered for modern medical science. Chinese scientists extracted the active compound artemisinin (known as arteannuin in the past or qinghaosu in Chinese). However, this drug remained largely unknown to the Western scientific community until 1979 when a review of its application was published in English language (Group 1979). In fact, it took a while for the rest of the world\u2014and especially the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2014to discover the potential of the antimalarial drug (Tu 2011). Unfortunately, it has been argued that there is a global supply shortage of artemisinin owing to an increasing demand and to the environmental factors affecting the harvest of the 14-week-growing-plant, primarily in Chinese and Vietnamese but more recently in Indian and East African farms (Enserink 2005), yet this is a matter of controversy.8 Artemisinin can also be chemically synthesized, but it is very expensive and non-affordable to most of the patients.",

The process of producing artemisinin has been shortened to only 14 days, but this took Keasling and colleagues many years of research with both successes and failures (Keasling 2008). For example, suboptimal expression of exogenous genes (having different genetic code usage) or volatility of molecules were encountered, but these problems were solved by optimizing synthetic genes (Martin et al. 2003) and reaction conditions (Newman et al. 2006). In the end, Keasling\u2019s group was able to produce significant levels (>100 mg/L) of artemisic acid by engineering the mevalonate metabolic pathway with a total of 11 enzymes from E. coli, the yeast S. cerevisiae and the plant A. annua in E. coli (Fig. 4) (Chang et al. 2007).\n",

Recently, German scientists reported the development of an optimized system where the three-step chemical synthesis from artemisic acid to artemisinin can be reduced to a more economical and efficient single-step based solely on oxygen and light (Levesque and Seeberger 2012). This achievement should contribute to increasing the yields (hormones are produced in the gram range) while reducing artemisinin costs. A dose cost $2.40 United States (US) dollars several years ago, but the alliance of the first non-profit pharmaceutical company \u201cInstitute for OneWorld Health\u201d and the company co-founded by Keasling \u201cAmyris Biotechnologies\u201d planed to decrease the dose costs ten-fold (ca. $0.25) with aid of $42.6 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Towie 2006), and the cooperation with the French international company Sanofi-Aventis for scaling-up the industrial process. Thus far, more than 1.7 million of semi-synthetic artemisinin doses have been shipped to malaria-endemic countries in Africa including Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Niger, and Nigeria.9\n",

For example, the bacterium E. coli has been converted into \u201cEau D\u2019e coli\u201d, bacteria that smell like wintergreen or bananas depending on the growth state (MIT iGEM team in 2006); E. chromi, bacteria that glow in different colours (Cambridge iGEM team in 2009); or E. cryptor, a \u201chard-drive\u201d device to store information (CU-Hong Kong iGEM team in 2010). The main difference between GEMs and GMOs is that the former ones are built with BioBricks and following engineering principles, whereas the latter ones are constructed without these two requirements. The idea behind this distinction is to emphasize the development of potential applications based on GEMs that can be predictable, in contrast to \u201cstandard\u201d GMOs where this endeavour is not per se attempted from the onset.",

These facts illustrate not only the context-dependency of biology and the importance of molecular relationships beyond synthetic DNA, but also the challenges that the iGEM competition will meet in the coming years: There is a need to better characterize the existing parts and to increase their quality, and there are additional issues regarding industrial applicability, team judgement and research funding transparency (Vilanova and Porcar 2014). From all the winners at each competition, only a few projects have been published, and even less have a potential industrial application (Vilanova and Porcar 2014). This is why the application of engineering principles in biology based on standardized DNA parts is a challenging endeavour that requires understanding the complexity of gene networks and variability of each cell within heterogeneous cellular populations (Kwok 2010).",

The first genome that was chemically synthesized was that of the poliovirus (Cello et al. 2002) that infects humans, followed by that of the bacteriophage Phi X174 (Smith et al. 2003) that normally infects E. coli. The genome of the 1918 Spanish\u2019 influenza pandemic virus was then synthesized (Tumpey et al. 2005), followed by other human retroviruses (Wimmer et al. 2009).

Mycoplasmas are parasitic bacteria that cause respiratory and inflammatory diseases in humans. They lack a cell wall but the reason why these bacteria were chosen as model organisms is because they bear the smallest genomes among all bacteria that can support cellular growth in the laboratory.

Another health care application may be the development of synthetic bacteriophages (bacteria-killing viruses) given the recent emergence of antibiotic resistance, a huge global public health concern. Phage therapy is an old treatment that dates back to more than one century, but with the discovery of antibiotics during the first half of the 20th century; its application remained limited in the Western world (Reardon 2014).

Nonetheless, a new tool dubbed CRISPR-Cas9 has recently emerged for editing genes in multiplex with excellent HR efficiencies comparable to ZFNs and TALENs, but lower costs thanks to the programmability at the RNA level (Mali et al. 2013). Composed of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) of DNA and CRISPR-associated genes (Cas) along the genome, the CRISPR-Cas is an immune system that evolved in bacteria and archaea to combat hostile viruses and foreign plasmids by inducing site-specifically DSBs (Doudna and Charpentier 2014). The type-II CRISPR-Cas9 system has been used for deleting, adding, activating and suppressing target genes with great efficiency in many organisms (Fig. 6) (Charpentier and Doudna 2013; Doudna and Charpentier 2014). The technology has allowed the correction of genetic mutations of diseases such as cataracts and cystic fibrosis as well as the development of cancer models in animal tissues (Doudna and Charpentier 2014), and more recently the generation of human cells resistant to infection by HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Liao et al. 2015).\n",

Second, after overcoming the technical difficulties, they were able to recombine all strains and delete completely the 321 UAG codons as well as the protein that terminates protein synthesis at this signal for yielding the first GRO: E. coli C321.\u0394A. This bacterium exhibited improved efficiencies for incorporating XAAs into various proteins and increased resistant against infection by the bacteriophage T7 compared to the parental E. coli strain MG1655 (Lajoie et al. 2013b). Third, they probed the limits of MAGE by eliminating the most rare codons present in 42 essential genes involved in E. coli translation as a means to \u201cemancipate\u201d codons for incorporating further XAAs (Lajoie et al. 2013a). In this work, it was realized that all non-essential genes could be modified with synonymous codons without compromising cellular fitness. Finally, based on the previous work and the E. coli C321.\u0394A strain, on one hand, Church and colleagues, and, on the other, Isaacs et al. engineered essential genes to be functional by the rational dependence of XAAs, thus imposing the cells to be metabolically dependent on the external supply of XAAs (Rovner et al. 2015; Mandell et al. 2015). Both studies were able to show that E. coli can be contained in physical isolation without undetectable growth in liquid media for up to 14 or 20 days, as long as the XAAs was not added to the culture. The authors argue that their strategy \u201cis a significant improvement over existing biocontainment approaches\u201d (Rovner et al. 2015) and that it \u201cprovides a foundation for safer GMOs that are isolated from natural ecosystems by a reliance on synthetic metabolites\u201d (Mandell et al. 2015). Beyond biocontainment, other applications of GROs would be the production of proteins endowed with XAAs for basic research and perhaps biocatalysis (Budisa 2014).",

(2011), whose work was highlighted by Acevedo-Rocha and Budisa (2011) referring to \u201cE. chlori\u201d (see below). There are two basic approaches for creating CMOs. One strategy tackles proteins, the main executors of information, whereas the other one deals with the information carriers or nucleic acids (NA). As indicated in the previous section, together with some genetic tricks, the cultivation of microbes in the presence of unnatural building blocks allows their introduction in lieu of canonical amino acids or DNA. In 1983, Bacillus subtilis strain QB928 was able to grow on 4-fluorotryptophan, a synthetic analogue of tryptophan (Trp), one of the 20 canonical amino acids (Wong 1983). Thirty years later, the same microbe does not require Trp anymore for propagation, but only 4-fluorotryptophan thanks to its adaption that was accompanied by a relatively small degree of genomic changes (Yu et al. 2014). This is the first CMO whose proteome has been chemically modified by experimental evolution. E. coli has also been shown to grow on similar fluorinated Trp analogues (Bacher et al. 2004), but it also has the potential for accommodating other XAAs into its proteome (Bohlke and Budisa 2014).",

Although this CMO has been regarded the first living being bearing six bases as genetic code with many potential applications in basic and applied research (Thyer and Ellefson 2014), it should be mentioned that only one base pair per plasmid was present, corresponding to less than 0.0001 % of the total genetic content of that bacterium, which is about 1 % of the total cell dry weight.

Given the exposure of synthetic biology to the media, and concerns about harmful intentional or accidental misuses of synthetic microorganisms (Ferber 2004), several groups of bioethicists and members of non-governmental organizations have suggested having another Asilomar meeting to discuss the responsibility of synthetic biology research to society. Likewise, debates on synthetic biology under the Convention on Biological Diversity have considered a potential moratorium on the release of synthetic organisms, cells and genomes into the environment (Oldham et al. 2012). Although these debates were triggered after the publication of the first GDO by Venter and colleagues in 2010, biosafety concerns can be justified by the earlier synthesis of pathogenic viruses, such as the deadly 1918 H1N1 \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d (which killed an estimate of up to 50 million people) that was \u201cresurrected\u201d from archaeological samples (Tumpey et al. 2005), or the poliovirus, which was synthesized even without a template (Cello et al. 2002). Even though it has been argued that GDVs offer an opportunity to better understand infectious diseases (Wimmer et al. 2009), these pathogenic viruses also pose potential biosafety risks to the health of the laboratory workers and the public. Two incidents in 2014 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA (where the Spanish flu virus was synthesized) illustrate this: Samples from a low-virulence flu virus were contaminated with the lethal H5N1 avian flu strain, and bacteria causing deadly anthrax were not properly inactivated before their transportation into a lower biosafety level laboratory (Butler 2014), potentially exposing staff to the dangerous pathogens (Owens 2014).",

Bioterrorism is nothing new: the intentional release of pathogenic toxins, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and insects is a mode of biological warfare against humans and animals that many countries have used in the past. For example, during World War I, a German secret agent travelled to the USA to infect horses with glanders, a severe infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, which provokes respiratory ulcers, septicemia and death in horses, donkeys and mules. For this reason, the Geneva Protocol was introduced in 1925 to prohibit the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts. Later on, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) were introduced to regulate the production, storage and transportation of biological and chemical arms.",

Indeed, international regulations for gene synthesis were lacking for several years. It was only after 2007, when a journalist ordered online from a biotech company synthetic DNA of the smallpox virus to his home (Grushkin 2010), that the synthetic biology community proposed a set of policies related to the processes involving nucleic acids synthesis (Bugl et al. 2007). Among the new proposed policies is a first set that applies to firms supplying synthetic DNA. Using a database of pathogenic genomes and sequences of toxin genes, the firms should use special software to screen orders for potentially harmful DNA. A second set of proposed rules is aimed at regulating the purchase of DNA synthesizers and the reagent used in synthesis by enforcing the registration of the machines or the distribution of licenses to purchase specific chemicals needed for DNA synthesis.",

Because organisms close to their progenitors are pre-adapted to their native environments, it is logical to assume that GMOs, GEMs, GEOs would pose a mayor threat than GDOs, GROs and CMOs if all of these were accidentally released in the environment. However, since the latter organisms use or potentially can use synthetic building blocks as constituents that could only be synthesized in the lab; they would be quickly outcompeted by other organisms if the chemicals are correctly disposed. Therefore, orthogonal and bottom-up engineering should also follow the guidelines that chemistry labs have established for chemical disposal, together with those for biosafety labs involving GMOs, which is the norm for top-down and parallel engineering approaches. Given that synthetic biology is an extension of genetic engineering, current legislation on GMOs also applies to GEMs, GDOs, GEOs, GROs and those CMOs that have been previously modified to incorporate unnatural DNA bases and/or amino acids, at both the EU17 and international18 level. But there have been doubts about whether the current risk assessment procedures will be overburdened by the increasing pace of genetic modification, which is the case for GDOs, GEOs and GROs. In consequence, the latest EU recommendations \u201ccall for research to improve the ability to predict the behavior of complex engineered organisms\u201d, and for the \u201cdevelopment of additional approaches, including genetic firewalls based on noncanonical genetic material\u201d (Breitling et al. 2015).",

On the other hand, if a GRO or CMO dependent on XAAs manages to survive in the environment by any means, would it pose threats to other natural organisms, and if so, what kind of threats? Would GROs be more robust than CMOs in case of an accidental release in the environment?

One of the plans is to edit the DNA of a man\u2019s sperm or woman\u2019s egg and use the cells in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic to produce the embryo, followed by its implantation in woman uterus to establish a pregnancy of the foetus.20 Another strategy that promises to be more efficient aims to edit stem cells, which can divide rapidly in the lab, and then turn them into a sperm or egg.

DIY biologists or \u201cbiohackers\u201d have equipped their garages, closets, and kitchens with inexpensive laboratory equipment (Ledford 2010). Although DIY biologists performed simple experiments in the past, such as the insertion of a fluorescent protein into bacteria for producing glow-in-the-dark yogurt, it is expected that applications in health, energy and environmental monitoring will emerge (Seyfried et al. 2014). In some instances, however, there has been a rising concern that home-brew drugs could be also produced by DIY-biologists using synthetic microbes. This fear has been recently strengthened when metabolic engineers made yeast strains capable of synthesizing one of the various precursors of the opiate morphine, a precursor of heroin that has a high demand in the illegal drug market (Ehrenberg 2015).23 Although this research is intended to enable the long-term centralized and legal production of opiates for pain relief, engineered yeasts for opiate biosynthesis could transform into illegal systems for criminal networks in USA and Europe where drug demand is the highest, because yeast is extremely easy to be sent (a few dried cells per post would suffice to start a culture), grown (water and basic nutrients are only required) and processed (basic lab equipment such as centrifuges) to extract any drugs (using basic columns and resins for chromatography). Thus, the democratization of molecular biology might be more difficult to regulate than initially thought.24\n",

In fact, chemical companies produce yearly billions of tons of chemicals from about 90,000 different substances. One goal of synthetic biology is to produce enzymes and microbes that could replace the production of many of those compounds because their precursors are usually obtained from fossil fuels and thus unsustainable (Nielsen and Moon 2013). A recent sampling of European rivers, however, illustrates the environmental damage that has been produced with toxic cocktails of hormones, pesticides and hazardous chemicals (Malaj et al. 2014), let alone population declines of bees, birds and other insects that are essential in the global food supply chain (Chagnon et al. 2015). In fact, irreversible damages of many toxic, non-degradable and persistent chemicals on the immune, reproductive, endocrine and nervous systems of many animals (and likely humans) have been found.25 To avoid similar environmental catastrophes using synthetic biology, proper legislation and regulation on the industrial production and waste of engineered microbes have to be implemented from the onset. A challenge for synthetic biology will be to regulate and assess the long-term effects of GMOs in the environment. To enhance biosafety biocontainment strategies, various genetic safeguard mechanisms could be implemented in each engineered microbe together with a \u201crisk analysis and biosafety data\u201d sheet (Moe-Behrens et al. 2013).",

            "text": "The GMO debate has existed since the Asilomar conference when biotechnology started to be regulated in general, but in the last two decades it shifted towards risks posed by genetically modified food and crops owing to the food crisis in Europe during the late 1990s. Nowadays, GMOs are commonly used in industrial (white) and medical (red) biotechnology for the respective production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals (in physically containments), but the genetic modification of plants and animals in agricultural (green) biotechnology has met more resistance in society owing to the potential risks of GMOs for humans, animals and the environment. There are different kinds of risks: real versus perceived, which depending on the stakeholder, can vary significantly (Torgersen 2004). Regardless of the risks and semantics (Holme et al. 2013; Hunter 2014; Nagamangala Kanchiswamy et al. 2015), it is clear that the GMO debate is mostly associated to multicellular organisms such as plants (Boyle et al. 2012) and animals (Markson and Elowitz 2014). Given that synthetic biology is increasingly targeting these multicellular organisms for genomic modifications, its acceptance by the public could be more difficult to gain. The main reason is that plants and animals directly affect human life, in contrast to microbes, which affect human life more indirectly: \u201cAs long as synthetic biology creates only new microbial life and does not directly affect human life, it will in all likelihood be considered acceptable\u201d (van den Belt 2009, p. 257). Beyond the potential of synthetic biology for solving global issues, society may only accept any kind of GMOs, GEMs, GEOs, GDOs, GROs and CMOs if their products are labelled for the consumer in a transparent way where the freedom of choice is given to the consumers.",

            "text": "One of the most common mistakes that scientists often make is to claim that they think they have created something, and that this creation, they believe, will be a panacea to humankind. First of all, scientists do not \u201ccreate\u201d, because this word can be used in different contexts: Creation or \u201cCreatio ex nihilo\u201d means to bring someone or something into existence out of nothing, and it is usually reserved for a divine force in religious terms that scholars in social sciences and humanities might use more often. In reality, scientists invent or design something that has not existed before by using something that already existed; they are closer to \u201cmanipulatio\u201d (manipulating) and \u201ccreatio ex existendo\u201d (creating something out of existent parts) than to \u201ccreation ex nihilo\u201d (Boldt and Muller 2008). This is a subtle, yet important difference: Scientists claiming the creation of synthetic life have been accused of \u201cPlaying God in Frankenstein\u2019s Footsteps\u201d (van den Belt 2009), with unfortunate consequences for the reputation of the field and its social acceptance (Schummer 2011). Perhaps the natural scientists do this on purpose to challenge the ethical (Link 2012) and religious (Dabrock 2009) views of other scholars working on synthetic biology. On the other hand, overstating that GMOs, GEMs, GEOs, GDOs, GROs and CMOs will solve all human problems is not beneficial because exaggerating exactly into this direction generates mistrust in the public, as many emergent technologies have done in history (Torgersen 2009). Hence, a lesson to synthetic biologists would be to be more cautious with their metaphors and promises, if they want to gain public acceptance of their technologies. For a more insightful discussion of the impact of metaphors in synthetic biology, see the chapter by D. Falkner in this book.",

In fact, a recent survey in Germany confirmed this, but also revealed that people spontaneously perceived this field as an abstract and contradictory expression that they associated with interference against Nature.26 How can nature be synthetic? Synthesis means to put together two parts to form a new one. This definition suggests that any minor modification of an extant organism would render it \u2018synthetic\u2019, which would be the case for all GMOs, CMEs, GEOs, GDOs, GROs and possibly CMOs. However, a bacterium with a synthetic plasmid is not the same as a bacterium with a synthetic genome, so we should make a distinction. For example, the synthetic genome of GDO M. mycoides jcvi-syn1.0 represents about 1 % of the whole dry cell mass. The cell reprogramming was performed using a genome borrowed from a related species, in which about 0.1 % genetic changes (watermarks) were done. So, why should this bacterium be called synthetic when the other 98.9 % components are natural? In reality, this bacterium is more natural than synthetic: Although genomes control gene expression, the truth is that genomes can only be useful if there are proteins that can process their information, as it was the case for M. mycoides jcvi-syn1.0. In a contrasting example, when the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis was cloned into the bacterium B. subtilis, genes from the former could not be expressed in the latter organism because of \u201cincompatibility\u201d or context-dependency issues (Itaya et al. 2005). Thus, synthetic genomes only represent a minor part of cells, in contrast to lipids (which are not encoded in the genome) and proteins, of which there are millions of molecules in a single E. coli bacterium, let alone other important components (Fig. 9).\n",

This endeavour could be facilitated by clearly distinguishing that DNA is not equal to life (de Lorenzo 2010), but just another minor component of life, as important as the other ones (Fig. 9). Another manner to engage the public with synthetic biology is by fostering cultural activities around the technology (see the chapter by B. Wray).",

It was resurrected for 7 min on July 30th 2003 by nuclear transfer cloning (the germ cells had been frozen). Nuclear transfer involves the injection of the genetic material to be cloned into an unfertilized DNA-free egg, resulting in cells that have the potential to divide when placed in the uterus of an adult female mammal. This is how Dolly the sheep (5 July 1996\u201414 February 2003) was cloned from an adult somatic cell (Wilmut et al. 1997), but dozens of other species27 have also been cloned despite the low efficiency of the technique. Besides nuclear cloning, it has been suggested that synthetic biology could cooperate with the biodiversity conservation community to protect or even resurrect extinct organisms (Redford et al. 2013). However, there are several technical and nontechnical issues that first have to be resolved, and this is clearly reflected in even Venter being cautious:I have read too many articles that breezily discuss the reconstruction of a Neanderthal or a woolly mammoth with the help of cloning, even though the DNA sequences that have been obtained for each are highly fragmented, do not cover the entire genome and \u2013 as a result of being so degraded \u2013 are substantially less accurate than what is routinely obtained from fresh DNA.

Almost all engineering efforts produce protocells, CMOs and GMOs, some of which are developed by well-known genetic engineering methods, and others by using more sophisticated tools. For example, the production of Genetically Engineered Machines (GEMs) is outsourced to undergraduate students every year across the world with the advantage of developing creativity and innovation in younger generations for solving complex problems. Similarly, researchers working in synthetic genomics have produced genomically designed organisms (GDOs) as a result of basic research, spinning-off revolutionary applications for the rapid assembly of synthetic DNA. More recently, the ground-breaking CRISPR-Cas9 tool, product of basic research, has allowed for the emergence of an impressive number of genomically edited organisms (GEOs), and in less than two years to better understand disease models and cellular biology as well as engineering multiple traits in microorganism for the optimal production of drugs, biofuels, and chemicals. However, the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system should be cautious especially when engineering human embryonic stem cells as well as wild populations of organisms in the open environment (Ledford 2015). Finally, evolutionary approaches have accelerated the construction of microbial GROs and CMOs that promise to shed light on the meaning and evolution of life by endowing living systems with unnatural building blocks.",

These phenomena, which fall under the scope of epistasis (Phillips 2008), emphasise the evolutionary complexity of gene interactions inherent to biology. For this reason, synthetic biologists should be aware of the limitations that must be overcome to predict the behaviour of living systems. The purpose of illustrating the benefits, but also potential risks of these emergent life forms is to provide scholars from the social sciences and humanities as well as non-scientists with a glimpse of what synthetic biologists are actually doing. The challenges, dilemmas and paradoxes surrounding the field also show that there are already big challenges in a globalized world that cannot be solved exclusively by technological means. Whether synthetic biology will deliver health, food, and energy to societies with very different needs in the South and North without affecting an already polluted environment where biodiversity lost is an everyday phenomenon will be seen in the coming century.",

Engineering-based GMO design and construction has resulted in the crowdsourcing of Genetically Engineered Machines (GEMs) through the famous international GEMs competition (see below). In the bottom-up approach, Genomically Designed Viruses (GDVs) and Organisms (GDOs) can be reprogrammed by assembling commercial synthetic DNA, which can be subsequently transplanted into living cells. The first GDO reported was Mycoplasma, whose genetic code\u2014do not confound with genetic program\u2014was not altered, in contrast to yeast, whose genetic code (and program) is being modified in order to accommodate unnatural amino acids (see below). Genomically Edited Organisms (GEOs) are GMOs whose genetic material has been modified employing cutting-edge molecular tools. Genomically Recoded Organisms (GROs) are GEOs whose genetic code has been modified to accommodate unnatural amino acids (and perhaps unnatural DNA bases in the future). Finally, Chemically Modified Organisms (CMOs) are composed of unnatural nucleic acids and/or amino acids.
