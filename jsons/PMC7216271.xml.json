SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus that causes human infections. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to lethal pneumonia, but it also has a stronger human-to-human transmission capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [4,5]. As of 1 April 2020, it has caused 876,898 infections in 203 countries, including 43,477 deaths. The on-going COVID-19 pandemic is a new and huge global public health threat [6,7]. In the absence of suitable antiviral drugs or vaccines, simple, rapid and reliable detection of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical not only for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also for clinical treatment [8].

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) assays had been developed, and have played an essential role in laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [3,9,12]. However, the RT-qPCR assay requires sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel, and it is relatively time-consuming (about 1.5\u20132 h), which limits its capacity to meet the demand for detecting the virus in a rapidly growing number of patients with COVID-19 infection, suspected infection, or close contact with confirmed cases. Therefore, fast, simple, and sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) assays are urgently needed to facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ",

Several sets of SARS-CoV-2-specific LAMP primers, targeting N, S and RdRp genes, were designed according to the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence, using the open access Primer Explorer V.5 software tool (http://primerexplorer.jp/). The primer specificity was first evaluated via sequence alignment with the other six human coronaviruses and the performance of a homology search using the BLAST tool in NCBI, and then by performing an RT-LAMP reaction with non-template control (NTC). After excluding the primer sets with non-specific amplification in the NTC reaction, one primer set targeting the N gene was found to have higher amplification efficiency, and was thus selected for use in the development of the method (Table 1 and Figure 1).",

Because of its newness, communicability, and rapid spread, SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic and created great international concern.

Early diagnosis, and the timely implementation of intervention and quarantine measures, are crucial to prevent the spread of the virus and optimize clinical management. Therefore, the development of simple, rapid and reliable diagnostic assays is of high priority for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Many RT-qPCR assays have been developed since the outbreak, and contributed to the confirmation of most SARS-CoV-2 infections during the pandemic in China [3,9,12]. Currently, although the COVID-19 pandemic has been contained following the strong public health intervention efforts of the Chinese government, the virus is spreading quickly outside China, including into some resource-limited areas. The stringent requirements of facilities and professional workers, and its time-consuming nature, limit the use of RT-qPCR assays in some undeveloped countries. Furthermore, the presence of asymptomatic infections and the long incubation period of COVID-19 increase the difficulty of diagnosis, because some SARS-CoV-2 carriers may not visit the hospital for diagnosis due to lack of symptoms or signs of infection [21]. Therefore, simple, rapid and sensitive POCT detection assays, that can be deployed more widely, will be very helpful for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and should be developed.",

We recently upgraded the LAMP method to a mismatch-tolerant version [14,15]. Compared to the conventional LAMP method, the novel version contains an additional 0.15 U of high-fidelity DNA polymerase, which confers upon it a higher applicability to highly variable viruses, and a 10\u201315 min faster reaction speed. In this study, we established a rapid and sensitive one-step single-tube RT-LAMP assay, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using the mismatch-tolerant technique. The assay can be performed at 63 \u00b0C for 50 min in a real-time PCR instrument, for real-time monitoring using fluorescent dye, or for 40 min in a regular PCR machine or heating block (e.g., dry incubator or water bath), for visual detection using pH-sensitive indicator dyes. In the real-time monitoring system, SYTO9 is used as a fluorescent dye which has a minimal inhibitory effect on LAMP amplification [10,14]. In the visual detection system, cresol red is used as a pH indicator dye because of a clear color contrast between negative (red) and positive (yellow) reactions after 40 min of incubation at 63 \u00b0C; a color change from red to orange or yellow is defined as SARS-CoV-2 positive [24].

In particular, when the template input is more than the LOD, the assay has a very fast detection speed of less than 20 min. The robustness of the novel assay was tested using 56 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and control populations in Nantong. The novel RT-LAMP assay showed a high consistency (92.9%) with a commercial RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. There were four samples showing inconsistent results by both the RT-qPCR assay and the novel RT-LAMP assay. The reason for two samples testing positive by the RT-qPCR assay but negative by the RT-LAMP assay may be the very low copy numbers (having high CT values of >38 in the RT-qPCR assay). However, regarding the other two samples tested positive by the RT-LAMP assay (with a high time threshold of >45 min) but negative by the RT-qPCR assay, the reason is speculated to be the presence of viral variants, that have caused mismatches with the primers and/or probe [11,14].",

SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected with a commercial SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit (Liferiver Bio, Shanghai, China) and the novel RT-LAMP assay. Because the amounts of RNA from clinical samples were very limited, we only performed a comparison between the real-time monitoring RT-LAMP assay and the commercial RT-qPCR assay. The concordance rate between both assays was calculated by the formula: (number of consistent results by both methods/total number) \u00d7100%.",

The RT-LAMP assay has a high sensitivity, with a LOD of 118.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per 25 \u03bcL reaction, and good specificity regarding common respiratory viruses. Validation using 56 clinical samples confirmed that the RT-LAMP assay\u2019s performance was similar to that of the RT-qPCR assay in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Although their specificity regarding SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was not tested, in view of the lethal nature of these two coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, a positive result for any of these three coronaviruses might be of clinical importance. The novel SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay has been developed into real-time monitoring and colorimetric versions, both of which will be especially useful in COVID-19 surveillance.",
