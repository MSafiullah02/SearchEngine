Studying how the lumen of the reproductive tract affects sperm function is a prerequisite to unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex modification of sperm.

            "text": "The seminal vesicle is a male accessory sexual gland found in many species of more than 4000 mammalian species alive on the earth today. After puberty, the gland secretes a fluid called seminal vesicle secretion (SVS), which accumulates in its lumen. SVS contains both protein and nonprotein components. When ejaculated, SVS squirts into the urethra, contributing the major part of the liquid portion of seminal plasma, which is the complex biological fluid formed from mixing of various fluid in the male reproductive tract. It has been found that extirpation of the seminal vesicle from mice and rats greatly reduces fertility [7, 8], demonstrating the importance of SVS to sperm modification under natural circumstances. SVS differs extensively in terms of volume and composition in various species of mammals. However, rodents have proven to be good experimental animals for the molecular study of mammalian reproduction, so attempts have been made to isolate the proteins involved in sperm modification by mouse SVS, which contains several minor proteins and seven well-defined major proteins designated SVS I\u2013VII, named in decreasing order of molecular mass according to their mobility in SDS-PAGE [9]. Previously, we demonstrated that SVS VII enhances sperm motility [10], and two of the minor proteins modulate sperm activity. One is a caltrin-like trypsin inhibitor/P12, which suppresses Ca2+ uptake by sperm [11], and the other is a seminal vesicle autoantigen, which serves as a decapacitation factor [12, 13].",

The seminal vesicles of 30 mice were carefully dissected to free them from the adjacent coagulating glands, and the secretions were squeezed directly into 50 ml of ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl in the presence of 1 mM PMSF at pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 10 000 \u00d7 g for 15 min, the supernatant was resolved by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (12 \u00d7 2.6 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. After the nonretarded fractions were washed out, the column was eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 18 ml/h. Fractions (4 ml) were collected, and their absorbance at 280 nm was recorded (Fig. 1A). Fraction III was further subjected to ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a sulfopropyl (SP) column (7.5 cm \u00d7 7.5 mm). The column was sequentially eluted with three linear gradients, including 0%\u201315%, 15%\u201340%, and 40%\u201380% of 0.6 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium acetate at pH 6.0 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min for 60 min (see Fig. 1B).

The primer pair for amplification of a 237-base pair (bp) Ceacam10 gene fragment was a forward primer (5\u2032-TATGCTATTTCAAAACTTCGATCAT-3\u2032), which corresponds to sequence 822\u2013846, and a reverse primer (5\u2032-GTTATGCGGACTTTATTG-3\u2032), which corresponds to sequence 1058\u20131041 (GenBank accession number NM_007675). The primer pair for amplification of a 557-bp mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapd) DNA fragment was a forward primer (5\u2032-CGGCAAATTCAACGGCACAGT-3\u2032), which corresponds to sequence 199\u2013219, and a reverse primer (5\u2032-TGGGGGTAGGAACACGGAAGG-3\u2032), which corresponds to sequence 755\u2013735 (GenBank accession number XM_194302). PCR reaction mixtures consisted of 2 \u03bcl of template, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.2 mM dNTP, and 0.2 \u03bcM primer pair in a 50-\u03bcl final solution of 10 \u03bcM Tris-HCl, 50 \u03bcM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2 at pH 8.3. PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA) with the following parameters: 3 min at 94\u00b0C followed by 30 cycles of melting for 30 sec at 95\u00b0C, annealing for 30 sec at 53\u00b0C, extension for 30 sec at 72\u00b0C, and a final extension for 7 min at 72\u00b0C. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2.0% agarose gel. The identity of PCR products was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. DNA sequencing was carried out with an ABI PRISM 377-96 DNA sequencer using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems).",

AVPPXVTADNNVLL was determined from the peak a sample. Two amino acids were detected in each cycle during protein analysis for each peak (b to d). The actual yield of the two sequences in an individual cycle was such that the ratio of the major sequence to the minor one was estimated to be 2.5\u20133.0:1. Assembly of the major and minor sequences gave a peptide sequence of AQVTVEAVPPXVTA and QVTVEAVPPXVTA, respectively. The three N-terminal peptides were completely confirmed in the Ceacam10-deduced protein consisting of 265 amino acid residues in all positions except that X (asparagine), one potential site for an N-linked carbohydrate in CEACAM10, was not identified in the protein sequencing (Fig. 2B). The post-translational cleavage at the peptide bond between Glu and Ala, Thr and Ala, or Ala and Gln in the signal peptide of the putative CEACAM10 sequence gives rise to a peak a protein or to peak b-to-d proteins. As a result, peaks a to d share a very similar protein core with a slight difference in their N-terminal sequences. Thereafter, we combined them for further study. Among the SVS protein components on SDS-PAGE gel, antibody against CEACAM10 immunoreacted only to a 36-kDa protein band corresponding to the antigen, showing high specificity of the antibody.

When spermatozoa were preincubated with 1 \u03bcM CEACAM10 in a blocking solution at room temperature for 45 min, rhodamine fluorescence was prominent on the middle piece, relatively weak on the tail, and faint on the head (Fig. 7A, d).

To access the binding of CEACAM10 to epididymal sperm upon ejaculation, the ejaculated sperm were directly stained with the antibody. CEACAM10 was immunodetected on the surface of the ejaculated sperm, in spite of high fluorescence background due to the free CEACAM10 that was difficult to removed completely during cell preparation (Fig. 7B, d).",

These evolutionarily and structurally divergent glycoproteins of mammals share many common structural features [29].

According to the molecular model established by Watt et al. [30] and Tan et al. [31], there are nine \u03b2 strands in one immunoglobulin-like domain involved in the maintenance of the three-dimensional architecture. In the CEACAM10 molecule, residues 2\u201396 form one IgV-like domain and residues 122\u2013216 form another [14]. This may account for the characteristic CD shown in Figure 2C. Many members of the murine and human CEACAM family contain either a transmembrane domain or a glycosyl PtdIns moiety, but no such structural element is present in the Ceacam10-deduced protein sequence, suggesting that CEACAM10 is not a membrane-bound protein [32].

As a result, the appearance of Ceacam10 mRNA in embryo samples at the blastula or gastrula stage (6.5\u20139.5 d.p.c.) (Fig. 5B) may arise from the maternal decidua as suggested in the study by Finkenzeller et al. [33]. This finding, together with the lack of an RNA message in embryo samples at 4.5 and 10.5\u201318.5 d.p.c. (Fig. 5B) implies that Ceacam10 might be weakly expressed if not silent during the entire course of embryonic development. In fact, we were unable to immunodetect the presence of CEACAM10 in the embryo samples obtained by carefully microdissecting the extraembryonic tissues from the conceptus at 8.5 to 18.5 d.p.c. Cytochemical observations shown in Figure 7 suggest the presence of CEACAM10-binding sites on the entire sperm surface. Considering the presence of CEACAM1 on human sperm cells [34], it raises a possibility that heterophilic adhesion exists between CEACAM10 and other CEACAM molecules on the mouse sperm surface. This is unlike the action of other sperm motility effectors in the mouse SVS, such as SVS VII, which binds neutral phospholipid to enhance sperm motility [10], and SVA, which predominantly binds membrane phosphatidylcholine to suppress sperm motility [12].",

Cell motility determined at each specified incubation time was expressed as a percentage of control cell motility at time zero. Points are mean \u00b1 SD for three determinations. *P < 0.01 in a paired statistical comparison with the corresponding control. Values were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance",
