Within the medical infrastructure, there are critical technologies that are generally available, but simply do not exist in a high enough density to handle the excessive volume of patients associated with pandemics\n5. Thus, people die unnecessarily throughout the world because of a combination of COVID-19 infections and the lack of access to some of these technologies\n6. Ventilators are an example of technologies that are currently in critical short supply\n7,\n8. Mechanical ventilators are essential for treating both influenza and COVID-19 patients in severe acute respiratory failure\n9,\n10. Past studies have shown that intensive care units (ICUs) will not have sufficient resources to treat all patients requiring ventilator support during a massive pandemic\n11\u2013\n13, and ethically challenging triage\n14,\n15 would need to be used to decrease mortality over first-come first-served basis for ventilator allocation among patients. Some work has shown promise for using a single ventilator to support multiple patients during a disaster surge\n16\u2013\n18. In addition, it has already been shown that 3-D printed manifolds can assist with rapidly deploying this solution and there are\nopen source designs\n19. This is not necessarily straightforward\n20. Although some countries, like the United States, have stockpiles of ventilators\n21, there is consensus that there is not enough supply for serious pandemics\n22\u2013\n25 and that rationing would be needed\n26. The current medical system relies exclusively on specialized, proprietary, mass-manufactured ventilators from a small selection of suppliers. This supply model clearly fails when there is a sudden surge in demand for a relatively low-volume specialty product such as ventilators in a pandemic as analyzed here. The vast majority of medical equipment is heavily patented by a few specialty medical firms that sell small volumes because during \u2018normal\u2019 times, a medium-sized hospital only needs a handful. These firms have historically aggressively protected their intellectual monopolies\n27,\n28 to the detriment of human lives. In addition, non-practicing entities continue to attempt to actively prevent medical treatments from being deployed, even during the current COVID-19 pandemic\n29. Putting aside the absurdity of patenting and then obstructing others from using obvious inventions in normal times\n30\u2013\n32, in the wake of a pandemic where millions of lives are at stake, it is intuitively obvious that this type of greed is no longer acceptable.",

            "text": "Of these enabling technologies, the most advanced is the fused filament fabrication (FFF)-class of desktop 3-D printers that have spawned from the self-\nreplicating\nrapid prototyper (RepRap) project\n64\u2013\n66. With the distributed manufacturing model, designs are downloaded even in remote areas and are manufactured on demand as needed\n67 from readily available (and possibly recycled\n68\u2013\n80) materials. These 3-D printers are, in general, not particularly fast when making products, but with tens of thousands of 3-D printers already strategically deployed all over the world\n81, they have the capacity to fabricate an incredibly diverse and large range of products (growing exponentially)\n82, which have already been shared with open source design licenses. Here, the potential will be analyzed for hardware that can be as-much-as-possible digitally manufactured using accessible low-cost fabrication tools like RepRap-class 3-D printers and then readily constructed from widely accessible materials and simple tools (e.g. DIY hardware store sourced along with Arduino-class microcontrollers). RepRap technology in particular is stressed because designs in that ecosystem are already frequently shared, enabling true distributed manufacturing by making use of manufacturing equipment near the point of use. There are, however, many other means of open hardware-based digital distributed manufacturing approaches including CNC mills, laser cutters, engravers, and etchers and other digitally controlled fabrication tools. As pointed out by Mohammed\n83 many of these tools would overcome limitations of 3-D printing (e.g. speed of replication for flat parts are more easily cut from stock with a CNC tool using subtractive manufacturing than 3-D printing based additive manufacturing).",

The automated AMBU device was able to adjust the breathing rate and the volume of the air, which is comparable to older ventilators. However, it was also able to regulate the inspiration to expiration ratio and PEEP rate. Shahid\u2019s system comes with two modes: 1) mandatory ventilation (as in older models) and 2) assisted ventilation (as with most current systems). Thus, the medical personnel can choose to use either the built-in triggering mechanism (assist boosted mode), which alters the respiration pattern once it detects a change in air pressure, or set a time interval for the respiration pattern.

The results of this study support the potential for mass distributed production of a low-cost, gas-powered, volume-controlled ventilator with a low oxygen consumption (anywhere with oxygen at 2\u20134 bar). The designs could alternatively be operated on hospital compressed air. The single use, self-inflating bellows system prevents cross contamination among patients.

The design is based upon using off-the-shelf components and is comprised of an open source Arduino Nano for control, high pressure blower and two pressure transducers.

Their\nsupplementary material also covers the testing with healthy volunteers, but more importantly, has the basic layout of the device, PCB and circuit schematics including source files, a BOM, STLs for the 3-D printable case, description of the algorithm and the Arduino ino file, and a user manual. This device\u2019s source is available and would represent a method to fabricate a ventilator for <$75, which has already been vetted by medical professionals. There are several interesting points about the approach used\n106. First, Garmendia et al. took the non-invasive medical approach, which is particularly well suited for both low-income countries\n107 and also perhaps during pandemics where even the wealthiest nation\u2019s medical systems are strained. By focusing on off-the-shelf components their design could be easily replicated. In \u2018normal times\u2019, this approach is second only to systems that can be\ncompletely digitally fabricated with local resources. In pandemic situations, it exposes why it is important to have many such designs, as the global supply chains have been disrupted\n108\u2013\n110. Normally, in the U.S. to replicate Garmendia\net al.\u2019s design based on the documentation provided would only be expected to take a few days. With the disruption, numerous makers have been having trouble sourcing supplies in the U.S., and the lowest-cost blower following the Garmendia\net al. design has an estimated shipping of 8\u201318 days on 4-28-2020 in the U.S. There are alternatives for providing this function (both suppliers and devices), which is why it is important to have a \u2018diversity of solutions\u2019\n62 with as many alternative suppliers, components and possibly even digitally manufacturable parts as possible (e.g. there are already several 3-D printable centrifugal blowers developed, which would demand future work for this application). Lastly, this design did not appear to have a license associated with it being a purely medical science publication. Even the Arduino code, which did have an author information for help, did not contain any license. This could hamper rapid deployment in some contexts as not explicitly indicating a license declares an implicit copyright without explaining how others could use the code\n111,\n112. ",

Thus, within the peer-reviewed literature, most of the quasi-appropriate ventilator devices use a standard ventilation bag that is cyclically compressed by either an electromechanic or pneumatic setup and controlled by a microcontroller. Fortunately, the most complicated part of these designs is the controls, which is made accessible by the maturation of Arduino-based microcontrollers that can actuate and sense over a wide array of accessible and already-developed technologies (e.g.\ncode libraries are available). It should be noted that most of the low-cost options in the literature used the bag approach, but that modern commercial ventilators are generally not manufactured with bags, bellows or pistons due to performance concerns. These concerns may be overcome by the nature of a pandemic, as well as by replacing low-cost components during failure, but this does indicate failure detection is warranted and certainly preferred in an open source ventilator design.",

The most favored by both the academic literature as well as the maker community is just to use manual ventilators \u2013 BVMs/AMBU bags. There are many commercial suppliers available and there is very preliminary documentation for open source manual ventilation for the developing world\n115,\n116. Although, in theory, purely manual ventilation could work to provide ventilation for patients over long periods, there is a real concern of both the availability of the needed man-power, as well as the continued exposure of the laborer. In addition, using a bag-valve mask may increase aerosolization of virus, and in general medical staff are not supposed to bag mask before intubation due to that risk. Many of the open source designs rely on this BVMs/AMBU bags approach where one automates the manual squeezing. It only needs an exhaust system and PEEP valve. Students at Rice University have also created an automated bag-valve mask device that fits around a normal BVM using a dual rack and pinion design with a servo motor that continuously operates (open/close) squeezing the bag a specific amount to supply air. Rice provides a full\nnon-peer-reviewed report, that is considerably richer in details than most of the others. It offers their design strategy, a partial BOM, basic testing, the\nsource code as well as a summary of the standards and regulations necessary to go to market. Unfortunately, in their preliminary testing, the servo motor failed after only 11 hours of service and Rice is withholding the full CAD designs and results. To overcome the limitations of both the MIT and Rice designs,\na group in Ireland formed and is moving along with full open source documentation of\nOpenLung on GitLab. The German language\nDIY-Beatmungsger\u00e4t project They are on their fifth iteration as of this writing based on the surrounding low-cost BVM/AMBU bag concept discussed above. Another project building off the MIT design is\nDIY Ventilators. Finally, the open hardware\nOxyGEN project is also using automated AMBU approach and although at the preliminary stages their 3-D and MATLAB design files are hosted openly on\nGitHub. The OxyGEN current system is under production in Spain.",

Another approach is to turn a commercial CPAP machine into a ventilator currently under development on\nGitHub by Lee. Lee built the system around an Arduino nano and has performed very basic tests to it that show that it provides enough pressure for a ventilator used on COVID-19 patients; however, there is not nearly enough information to recommend it for medical use. In addition, there are bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) machines that are commonly used at home to treat sleep apnea and lung diseases as they decrease the effort of breathing by changing the pressure for inhalation and exhalation. Home-use BiPAPs could be used in place of hospital NIVs, but care would need to be taken because poor interfaces could generate viral aerosols\n117. Negative pressure ventilation (iron lung) overcomes this problem, helping lung function by pulling from the outside (there has been some development on\nAppropedia).

With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed that these projects will garner more resources and members (as is happening with the Open Air Project) to reach a critical mass to make significant progress to reach a functional and replicable system. Although the motivation of working during a pandemic on a device that may save your life is high, the access to resources, however, is far from optimal. Already, many locations throughout the world are essentially forcing citizens to shelter-in-place, which restricts access to government and university labs, as well as to makerspaces and fab labs. In addition, some areas of the world are suffering from supply disruptions and shipping challenges. This perhaps underscores the importance of developing open source hardware for disasters before the disaster strikes.

People are literally dying from lack of ventilators and it is hard for designers not to feel responsible if they are reasonably confident a preliminary device design would possibly prevent those deaths if shared. Many makers follow this belief and often aggressively share their content before there is any evidence that it works. At the same time, well intentioned engineers and designers can have their work mischaracterized and promoted before it is documented by overly aggressive public relations outfits at both companies and universities, which has greatly added to the clutter in this space. On the other hand, as these are medical devices, which literally can mean life and death for a patient, it is reasonable to want to follow the conventional hardware developers\u2019 method: wait to release it until it has been fully tested. In addition, the effort and time it takes to do full documentation correctly may also appear to be lower priority than the making, prototyping and testing of the device itself. However, as Bowman\n122 points out the \u201cthe intent to share a design in the future misses the myriad benefits of open hardware - in terms of scrutiny, feedback, and improvements from the community. It also stifles the development of a community around the design, and there are many cases of promised openness never materialising.\u201d It appears clear that if a project is announced as open source it should include all of the code that is available.",

When this is done open announcements can be made to recruit feedback from the community. As ventilators are complex devices made up of mechanical components, electronics, sensors, and firmware/software it is challenging to have a complete device ready (Ideally the systems could reach a maturity in which the subcomponents could be made modular\n123). These particular devices are also specifically targeted at medical doctors therefore as Farre has pointed out \u201cit is important to make an effort to actively involve health professionals for both design and testing, trying to publish contributions in medical journals\u201d\n124. The diverse multidisciplinary skill set needed to develop a successful open source ventilator is therefore extremely challenging and explains in part why there is a lack of completed designs. Academic authors can still operate normally with publishing even if it is a hardware related publication.

            "text": "Even when more mature open source ventilator designs are available and can be safely manufactured by a distributed means, another area of critical future work is validation of these designs. In the medical sciences, open source devices like syringe pumps\n133,\n134 are already established\n135\u2013\n138 and have been developed into sophisticated devices\n139\u2013\n144. However, these devices are used in labs in general and not on people continually. For medical professionals to use an open source ventilator, they first must be convinced it will do no harm to them (or others) as well as to the patient. As COVID-19 was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human, there has been a concern that high-risk aerosol-producing procedures may put medical personnel at high risk of nosocomial infections, which is a concern for some designs reviewed here\n145. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE is needed and the study by Zuo\net al. provides a list of other recommendations to overcome this challenge. There have been some developments in 3-D printing some of these PPE\n146,\n147. Similarly, for designs that could aerosolize the virus, a negative pressure room would be necessary and future work is needed to design an open source approach to creating such rooms. Likewise, the greatest concern for untested open source ventilator designs is that they harm the lungs of the patients; there is significant literature in this area of ventilator-induced lung injury\n148\u2013\n155. There are, however, solutions for preventing this, like controlling the tidal volume\n156,\n157. Thus, the designers of open source ventilators must ensure that their designs have safety features to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury, as well as having basic testing of the prototypes to ensure that the designs themselves are thoroughly vetted. This must be done using yet-to-be-developed transparent process controls and quality assurances as well as tests. There has been some preliminary efforts in this direction for minimal qualifications based on the UK\nguidelines and the more than 70\nCOVID-19 Ventilator Validation Tests under development by Public Invention. More work, is needed however, to make freely accessible standards and protocols for testing, quality assurance and use of ventilators. Today such information is behind a complex web of paywalls from standards vendors, equipment suppliers, and copyright holders from publishers, universities and medical vendors and in the worst case are simply proprietary trade secrets. A future review is needed to find pathways to accessible sources of reliable information in each of these areas to accelerate the development of low-cost and free and open source medical hardware of every kind including ventilators",

Medical hardware used on humans is also more complicated, as any studies involving humans needed to verify its functionality on people, need institutional review board approval and, if in regulated areas like the U.S., such a study would need an Investigational Device Exemption to allow for a non-FDA approved device to be used as part of a study. This is only a temporary approval and the full device would need actual FDA approval for legal deployment unless the laws are changed (or were temporarily suspended during a pandemic). These same regulatory roadblocks are in place in other nations, which has conventional ventilator manufacturers skeptical that even conventional manufacturers of other products (e.g. vacuum cleaner and automobile manufacturers are doing this now in the UK) could switch over to produce ventilators\n158. Clearly, this process is a problem during a pandemic. Both for the current situation and during potential future situations, there is a need to limit liability on the part of the designers, makers and users of such open source medical hardware\n159. One approach is for \u2018Good Samaritan\u2019 laws to be expanded to protect both the makers and designers of open source medical hardware\n62. Substantial future work is needed in this area. Finally, it should be pointed out that personnel and training can become limitations to deploying mass medical efforts, even if open source ventilators are available. So, future work is needed to create training materials and translate it into the languages spoken throughout the world as well.",

The results of this review, however, found that the tested and peer-reviewed ventilator systems lacked complete documentation (with one recent exception) and that the current open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design or had undergone only early and rudimentary testing (although this is changing rapidly). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily replicated open source ventilator system. There is a large amount of technical future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered adequate for scientific-grade equipment and further work still to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach not only on the technical side, but also by developing policies, updating regulations and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic, as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.",
