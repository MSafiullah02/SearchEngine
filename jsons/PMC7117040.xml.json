However, the principle of membrane protein structure remains one of the greatest challenges in structural biology [2], [3], [4]. Compared with the estimated 1700 structures which are needed to account for each structural family [5], only about 180 high resolution structures for membrane proteins have been determined [6]. The complexity of the biological membrane environment causes much difficulty for related experimental research.",

Current atomic simulations are limited to the timescale of about 100 ns for membrane protein-containing systems because of the complexity and large size of the lipid membrane. Alternatively, much of the attention has been paid on the treatment of lipid membrane in two fashions. Similar with the coarse-graining process on proteins [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], the lipid chains can be grouped into united particles, therefore greatly simplifying system freedom and accelerating the simulation [14], [15]. Another approach is to employ the implicit membrane environment [16]. For example, a generalized Born solvation model has been extended to describe the membrane as a hydrophobic zone [17], [18]. In a lattice simulation, Chen et al. [19] set one region of the simulation box as an implicit membrane with the characterization of hydrophobicity and lateral pressure. Though, the lipid interface and the lipid hydrocarbon core are not respectively considered in the existing implicit membrane models. It was noted that the generalized Born model may not correctly include the proper interfacial characteristics, thus significantly affecting the transient protein structure while crossing the membrane interface [20].",

Supporting evidence can be found in Figs. 6 and 8. Helix(25\u201346) and helix(51\u201359) adopted clearly different orientations in lattice space, and the orientation swayed in a big range.",

The polypeptide chain was coarse-grained into a strand of minimal cubes connected by fluctuating \u03b1-carbon bonds, and the unoccupied lattice sites were regarded as the implicit lipid segments and implicit water molecules. The biological membrane was characterized with three features: strong hydrogen bonding, membrane lateral pressure, and lipophobicity. Moreover, another feature of this implicit membrane model is the representation of lipid interface, which was proved to be very resultful for the folding of transmembrane protein.",

In the folding process of SARS-CoV E protein, the coil\u2013helix transition occurred obviously earlier than the coil\u2013globule transition, demonstrating that the coil\u2013helix transition and the coil\u2013globule transition were apart from each other in the thermodynamic folding process of the transmembrane protein. For the M2(18\u201360) segment, the transmembrane helix(25\u201346) formed earlier than the amphipathic helix(51\u201359), and the latter finally adopted an orientation nearly parallel to the membrane surface. Thus, the coil\u2013helix transition process for the membrane protein segment and final layout in the membrane environment are obviously influenced by its corresponding hydrophobicity or lipophobicity. The different folding processes for helix(25\u201346) and helix(51\u201359) resulted from the competition between membrane lateral pressure, hydrogen bonding strength, and related hydrophobicity or lipophobicity. Such phenomena bear evidence of our implicit membrane model on the elaborate balance between different driving forces for membrane protein.",

In this work, the implicit membrane environment and associated coarse-grained model can efficiently reduce the workload and therefore provide ensemble averaged results in feasible time. Thus our model can be a potential means for simulating the folding and dynamics of transmembrane protein oligomers.",
