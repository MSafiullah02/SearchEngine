            "text": "Firstly, identified in an outbreak in Wuhan city of China, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic in early 2020. Alternatively named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus has been shown to induce various clinical manifestation in hosts ranging from asymptomatic conditions to severe symptoms including respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction [1]. Identification of IgM and IgG antibodies in the affected persons implies the development of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 [2], [3], [4]. However, the virus might also induce dysregulation of immune responses in susceptible individuals as demonstrated by the decreased lymphocytes counts especially T cells, increased leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio and other imbalances in the population of immune cells. Moreover, severely affected patients have shown raised concentrations of infection-related markers and over-secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Notably, this condition has been accompanied by a significant increase in the proportion of na\u00efve helper T cells while reduction in memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells [5]. Based on the importance of immune responses in the determination of course of infection and the related complications, we performed a literature search to find the reported dysregulations in the levels of cytokines and immune cells in patients infected with SARS-CoV-19 and related viruses.",

            "text": "A recent study in Chinese patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 has shown elevated plasma concentrations of IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b3-induced protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), MIP1A, MIP1B and TNF-\u03b1 in both patients needed ICU admission and non-ICU patients compared with healthy controls at initial assessment. Notably, author reported significant over-production of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF, IP-10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF-\u03b1 in ICU patients compared with other group of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons [6]. Another study has demonstrated associations between severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, disease severity was associated with both WBC and lymphocyte counts as well as quantities of neutrophils and eosinophils. Authors have suggested the IL-2R level >793.5U/mL, WBC>9.5*10^9/L or neutrophil count>7.305*10^9/L among parameters that indicate progression of SARS-CoV-19 infection to critical conditions. Thus, inflammatory responses were shown to be correlated with the severity of SARS-CoV-19. Besides, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 have been suggested as therapeutic targets [7]. A longitudinal study of cytokine levels and lymphocyte count in affected patients has revealed remarkable and continuous decreases in lymphocyte counts but elevations in neutrophil counts in severely infected cases compared with mild cases. Additionally, severely affected individuals had substantial reductions in T cells population, particularly CD8 + T cells, and upsurge in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels. Notably, T cell counts and cytokine concentrations in severe SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who stayed alive gradually returned to their levels in the mild cases. The most significant prognostic marker to show the course of infection has been the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio [8]. IL-6 has also been among the up-regulated infection-related markers in the serum of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [9]. Another study has demonstrated significant decrease in lymphocyte subsets both in severe and mild groups of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reduction in CD8 + T cells and increase in IL-6 levels were more prominent in the severely affected patients. Moreover, significant differences were detected between the severe and mild groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10 [7].",

            "text": "Cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV infection have been previously assessed in an animal study. Animals were exposed to the virus through an intranasal route. Such viral administration resulted in induction of pneumonia which was accompanied by over-production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5. Notably, increased cytokine and chemokine levels were associated with relocation of NK cells, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) into the lungs. The viral clearance was accompanied by another round of cytokine and chemokine release and an inflow of T lymphocytes occurred. Depletion studies showed the essential role of CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells in reduction of immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and enhancement of elimination of SARS-CoV from the lungs [10]. An in vitro study has shown insignificant induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression in SARS-CoV infected macrophages, while up-regulation of CXCL10/IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 and CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [11]. Wong et al. have assessed a number of cytokines and chemokines in patients affected with SARS. They detected significant increase in Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3, inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12, and some chemokines such as IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10. Levels of chemokines were significantly decreased after corticosteroid therapy. They concluded induction of Th1 cell-mediated immune response in patients. This observation was associated with induction of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [12]. In another study in the pediatric setting, Ng et al. have demonstrated significant increase in circulating IL-1\u03b2 concentrations. Yet, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 cytokines were slightly increased at the primary phase of the disease [13]. Zhang et al. did not detect any significant difference IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 levels between normal controls, patients with SARS, severe SARS or those with SARS in convalescence. IL-6 levels were higher in SARS particularly those with severe SARS course. Yet, IL-6 levels were not different between convalescent patients and healthy control, indicating the presence of a positive correlation between the serum IL-6 levels and severity of the disorder. On the other hand, IL-8 and TGF-\u03b2 levels were negatively correlated with SARS severity. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 concentrations were reduced, whereas IL-10 concentrations were elevated in convalescent SARS patients. Taken together, various immunoregulatory conditions are present during and subsequent to SARS infection [14].",

MERS-CoV induced higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8, while lower levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IP-10 compared with SARS-CoV. Their experiments confirmed the diminished induction of innate immunity and postponed proinflammatory cytokine production by MERS-CoV [15]. Kim et al. have reported higher neutrophil counts in severe MERS-CoV compared with mild cases. Moreover, IL-6 and CXCL-10 levels were higher in severe cases compared with mild cases. Besides, they could not detect IFN-\u03b1 response in mild cases [16]. Zhou et al. have shown ability of MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV in replication in monocyte-derived macrophages. MERS-CoV induced remarkably elevated concentrations of IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, and chemokines compared with SARS-CoV [17]. Mahallawi et al. have demonstrated a noticeable pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 response in patients affected with MERS-CoV. These patients had elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-15 and IL-17 compared to controls. Totally, cytokines profiles indicated an obvious pro-inflammatory immune reactions in the acute course of MERS-CoV infection [18].",

Dysregulation of cytokine levels have been demonstrated in almost all patients with this infection. Moreover, evident differences have been reported in the levels of several cytokines between severely affected patients and those with moderate or mild symptoms [6]. Identification of these aberrant reactions not only helps in recognition of patients who are predisposed to severe complications, but also would specify those would benefit from immune-modulating therapies. Due to the insufficiency of data on SARS-CoV-2, assessment of immune responses in other related disorders would provide a scheme permitting the anticipation of immune-related events which occur in the course of this novel infection. Yet, any of these viruses might exert some specific effects in the host. This speculation has been supported by an in vitro study on expression signatures of macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, human coronavirus 229E, and influenza A (H1N1) virus. Authors have reported slight or no induction of IFN-\u03b2 in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages. Yet, expression of this cytokine was induced in the macrophages infected with human coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus [11]. Moreover, there were significant differences in the pattern of cytokine induction between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [15]. It is worth mentioning that although low-level of SARS-CoV productive infection has been demonstrated in human monocytes/macrophages, these viruses have been identified in phagolysosomes but not on the cell surface implying absence of specific receptors for SARS entrance on macrophages [34]. Low efficiency of macrophage infections by this virus and production of IFN-\u03b1 by these cells might be involved in the restriction of the infection in human subjects [34]. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 cannot replicate in macrophages possibly due to lack of ACE2 expression (https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ACE2). Banerjee et al. have assessed an extensive spectrum of human immune cells for productive infection with this virus and verified lack of permissivity of human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells to this virus [35].",

However, there is no comprehensive data about the role of these cells in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, as noted by most of studies, the level of lymphopenia and upsurge of proinflammatory cytokines are determinants of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [8]. Lymphopenia in severe cases include both CD4+T and CD8+T subsets [7]. Meanwhile, elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10 has been suggested as factors that predict severe course of the disorder [7].",
