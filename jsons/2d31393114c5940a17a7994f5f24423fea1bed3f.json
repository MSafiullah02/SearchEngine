Earlier one study has reported that Macaflavanone C may be utilized for treating Alzheimer's disease (Gupta & Vadde, 2019a) . In 2016, Teponno and the team reported about the anti-melanogenic property of the Grossamide K (Bertrand Teponno et al., 2016) . Earlier Seo and his team have also reported that compounds present in the ethyl acetate fraction of Sanguisorba officinalis, namely euphormisin M3, arjunglucoside II, pomolic acid-3-b-O-a-L-arabionopyranoside, 3,3 0 -di-O-methylellagic acid, 3,8-dihydroxy-4,10-dimethoxy-7-oxo-[2] benzopyrono [4,3-b] [1]benzopyran-7-(5H)-one, chikusetsusaponin II, deglucose chikusetsusaponin Iva, belachinal, irilone and ellagic acid, may have the inhibitory effect on inflammasome pathways and protective role in endotoxininduced septic shock. However, to best of our knowledge, no medicinal properties have been assigned to rest seven phytochemicals, namely, Macaflavanone E, Vibsanol B, '14 R \u00c3 ,15-Epoxyvibsanin C', Luzonoid D, (-)-Blestriarene C, Macaflavanone F and Dolichosterone. As three compounds, namely, Belachinal, Macaflavanone E and Vibsanol B, have the minimal binding energy with the 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein (Table 1) , three separate complexes between 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein and each ligand were done separately using Discovery Studio Software. The complex of the 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E and Vibsanol B, separately, will be known as Complex A, B and C, respectively, henceforth. (Figure 2(a) ). RMSD in all the three complexes is found to be stable subsequently 180 ns. The Rg values of all three complexes ( Figure  2 (c)) support their condensed architecture as well as size Figure 2(d) ). This might be due to decreased potential energy and increased pressure in all the three complexes, which in turn supports that the random movement of the 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein decrease after binding with these phytochemicals (Figure 2(d) ); thereby supporting that these three phytochemicals may function as drugs for treating or controlling diseases caused via SARS-CoV2 in human.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1081, "end": 1103, "text": "(Gupta & Vadde, 2019a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1232, "text": "(Bertrand Teponno et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1535, "text": "[4,3-b]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 886, "end": 893, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2152, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2445, "end": 2457, "text": "(Figure 2(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2575, "end": 2584, "text": "Figure  2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2643, "end": 2654, "text": "Figure 2(d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2883, "end": 2895, "text": "(Figure 2(d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Molecular docking with phytochemicals"}, {"text": "The obtained result revealed that the final binding energy of Complex A (\u00c0250.979 \u00b1 0.272 kJ/mol) <Complex B (\u00c0214.938 \u00b1 0.280 kJ/mol) <Complex C (\u00c0197.457 \u00b1 1.236 kJ/mol).

No hydrogen and electrostatic bonds is found in either of the three complexes. In all the three complexes, amino acids present in the chain C and D mostly bind with ligands. Amino acids, namely VAL25 and PHE26 helps in bond formation in all three complexes. It is pertinent to note that these amino acids also experience the maximum RMSF during 200 ns simulation in the 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein; thereby suggesting their importance during protein-ligand interaction.

Results obtained revealed that the human 'SARS-CoV2 E' is a pentameric protein comprised of 35 a-helices and 40 loops. During 200 ns, a-helix and loops present in this protein experiences random movement, which in turn modulate normal ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates. However, after binding with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E, and Vibsanol B, the random motion of the human 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein gets reduced; this, in turn, inhibits the function of the human 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein. It is pertinent to note that, this is for the first time, authors are reporting about the medicinal property of Macaflavanone E, Vibsanol B. As these three phytochemicals, namely, Belachinal, Macaflavanone E & Vibsanol B, have passed the ADMET test and 'Lipinski's Rule of 5s', they may be utilized in controlling disease caused via
