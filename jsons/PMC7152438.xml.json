However, discovery and scientific advance changed that. Effective anesthesia, surgical antisepsis, antibiotics, the x-ray, and other advances turned the hospital into a place of comfort, hope, and healing. The 20th-century hospital became a sophisticated financial institution, the core of medical education, and the site of dazzling technological display. Medical advances offered aid not only to the chronically ill but offered hope to those who suffered acute trauma or medical or psychiatric emergency.",

            "text": "Past events illuminate the variety and complexity of demands placed on a hospital in a disaster:\u2022\nHurricane Katrina. The flooding in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 left hospitals in greater New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mississippi in crisis. Patients and staff were trapped in facilities without essential services, resulting in the largest mass hospital evacuation in U.S. history.\u2022\nFloods caused by tropical storm Allison in Houston, Texas. In June 2001, 3 feet of rain from tropical storm Allison fell in the Houston area, causing the flooding and complete disruption of services at the University of Texas Health Science Center and its clinical affiliate hospitals. One of the hospitals, Memorial Hermann Hospital, experienced failure of every hospital system. The main and emergency power generators and communications system failed and personnel could not come, go, or be reached. The water supply failed, and the sewer system stopped functioning. The vertical evacuation of 570 patients was conducted, and the hospital was closed for 38 days. The storm flooded an area not considered to be at risk.2\n\u2022\nThe Northridge, Calif., earthquake. An earthquake struck Northridge on Jan. 17, 1994, damaging a number of area hospitals. Six hospitals evacuated patients immediately: four of these evacuated all inpatients, and two evacuated some. Five of the facilities evacuated the most severely ill first, but the sixth, fearing imminent structural collapse, evacuated the healthiest patients first to permit the evacuation of the largest number of patients in the shortest period. That facility moved 334 patients from buildings to open areas in two hours. All hospitals used improvised transport devices, including backboards, blankets, and mattresses.3\n\u2022\nThe 2001 World Trade Center bombing. Bellevue Hospital, a level-1 trauma center in New York City, is approximately three miles from the World Trade Center. Ninety patients presented within the first five hours after the incident; a total of 194 were triaged and treated within the first 24 hours. Despite best efforts, the hospital lost track of patients, ran out of supplies, and struggled with coordination of physicians to ensure rest and safety.4 New York University Downtown Hospital, a few blocks from the disaster, received 350 patients within the first two hours of the World Trade Center attacks. Many patients arrived on foot.5 St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center executed its disaster plan within minutes of the bombing, as they had done during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. On Sept. 11, 2001, St. Vincent's Hospital treated nearly 800 victims. Because St. Vincent's shared water lines with the World Trade Center and telecommunications lines were routed through the World Trade Center, function of these systems was affected. Crisis counseling, pastoral care, and mental health services were immediately made available for victims, families, rescue workers, and staff.6\n\u2022\nThe Oklahoma City Bombing. After the explosion of a bomb at the Murrah Federal Building, 168 were killed and 700 were injured\u2014388 with acute injuries. The first patients arrived in emergency departments within 15 minutes, and the hospitals within 1.5 miles of the blast site received the greatest number of victims.7\n\u2022\nThe Rhode Island nightclub fire. On Feb. 20, 2003, fire erupted in a crowded nightclub in West Warwick, R.I. Almost 100 were killed immediately, and nearly 200 were injured. Kent County Hospital, a 350-bed community hospital 2 miles from the site of the fire, received 40 victims within an hour; 25 were rapidly intubated. The hospital ran out of critical supplies and ventilators and struggled with supporting family members, poor communications from the scene, and pain management.8 Ultimately, 16 hospitals in Rhode Island and Massachusetts received 196 burn victims; this included the Shriners Hospital for Children, which received and treated 16 adult victims.9\n\n",

The release of 40 tons of methyl isocyanate from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal, India, in December 1984 exposed more than 500,000 to the deadly gas and killed about 6000 in the first week after the release. In September 1987, workers scavenging a dismantled cancer clinic in Goiania, Brazil, took home a source containing cesium-137. They sold it to a junkman who showed the glowing item to friends and neighbors. Once radiation exposure victims presented to hospitals, and the release became well known, hospitals were overwhelmed. Although 250 were actually exposed and 28 showed signs of radiation sickness, 112,800 people were evaluated. When the Aum Shinri Kyo cult placed sarin on five trains in the Tokyo subway system on March 20, 1995, 4000 people made their own way to hospitals, 641 were transported by authorities, and 245 hospital staff and rescue personnel were contaminated due to poor or nonexistent decontamination procedures.10\n",

A powerful change in thinking, also called a paradigm shift, occurred after the terror attacks: the health system came to be viewed as a foundation of national security. Another perspective has changed as well. In the event of a disaster, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), police, and fire have long been recognized as first responders. However, just recently, hospitals also have been designated as first responders\u2014and first receivers.",

However, hospitals remain significantly underprepared to respond as effectively as the public expects. Most importantly, preparedness is at direct odds with productivity. Daily operating requirements stretch most hospitals' resources. Allocating funds to improve emergency response capabilities that may never be used could be viewed as foolhardy. Community integration is now seen as necessary, but hospitals (other than those in networks or that are government facilities) have had few reasons to build healthy relationships with other hospitals in their communities.

Nurses accustomed to a certain nurse-to-patient ratio may find the ratio in a disaster much higher and have to adapt practice accordingly.

The population includes not just the victims of the disaster, but the others presenting for needed care\u2014women preparing to give birth, patients with chronic disease exacerbation, and children with lacerations that need sutures. A vital hospital emergency management program acts as an insurance policy that increases the chances of continued operations under difficult circumstances. An effective hospital emergency management program guides the development and execution of activities that mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from incidents that disrupt the normal provision of care.14 The program should include the following components:\u2022\nEmergency manager: The emergency manager is the primary point of leadership in the development, improvement, exercise, and execution of the hospital's emergency management plan.\u2022\nEmergency management plan: The plan identifies the hospital's response to internal and external emergencies. Deliberate (advance) planning permits the development of strategies while the organization is not under pressure to react.\u2022\nExecutive leadership: Hospital executive leadership charts the course for an organization. A hospital that lacks executive leadership committed to emergency preparedness will be significantly hampered in its efforts.\u2022\nStrategic planning: The hospital's strategic plan is the blueprint that guides all efforts to achieve its mission. It is critical that emergency management and preparedness efforts are woven into strategic planning.\u2022\nEmergency management committee: Extremely broad membership is desired to ensure all hospital operations that will be stressed in a disaster are integrated and well prepared.\u2022\nHazard vulnerability analysis (HVA): The HVA is a tool used to assess the risks in a specific environment. The emergency management plan can be tailored to address the hazards most likely to affect hospital operations.\u2022\nVulnerability analysis: Every aspect of hospital operations that will be depended on in a disaster should be assessed to determine whether there are weaknesses present that fail when stressed. Hospitals in the U.S. Navy Medical Department and a number of civilian hospitals in New York have had their level of preparedness assessed using the Hospital Emergency Analysis Tool (HEAT). The HEAT examines more than 230 factors that contribute to effective emergency preparedness and response. After the systematic analysis by a team of experts, the hospital receives an after-action report that documents strengths and weaknesses and permits the development of a strategic plan to improve preparedness.15\n\u2022\nStaff training, exercise, and continuous improvement: The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires hospital staff members involved in the execution of the emergency management plan to receive orientation and education relative to their role in an emergency. Exercise of the emergency plan is also required. Lessons learned should be integrated into plans to continuously revise them.\n",

Disaster complacency\u2014believing a problem won't happen to you or your hospital\u2014is a significant threat to effective planning and response.\u2022\nProtect the staff: Only a true obsession with self-protection will ensure that staff members are not injured or become ill during disaster response. Adequate stockpiles of gloves, masks, and other equipment must be available, along with training and leadership commitment to self-protection policies.\u2022\nBuild in redundancy: Expect the primary plan to fail and build in alternatives to every emergency measure.\u2022\nRely on standard procedures whenever possible: People perform best in unusual situations when they perform activities that closely mirror what they do under normal conditions.\u2022\nMaintain records: Patient care records are critical to obtaining reimbursement for disaster care provided.\u2022\nPlan to degrade services: Normal levels of services cannot be maintained during disaster response. Identify services, such as elective surgery, that can be temporarily curtailed or minimized so that personnel and resources can be reassigned.\n",
