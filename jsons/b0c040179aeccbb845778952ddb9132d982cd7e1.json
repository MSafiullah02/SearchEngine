Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P < 0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.",

In addition, subcutaneous insulin was begun at the time of admission in all hyperglycaemic patients with or without a previous diabetes diagnosis: short-acting insulin was given before meals; At admission, higher IL-6 levels were found in hyperglycaemic patients that persisted even after TCZ administration (Fig. 1A) . Also, in the risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate the risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P < 0.009; Fig. 1B ). Moreover, diagnosis had an increased risk of severe disease compared with both normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic patients with a previous diabetes diagnosis ( Fig. S1 ; see supplementary material associated with this article online).",

[5] , who found that patients without diabetes, but with stress hyperglycaemia on admission for acute myocardial infarction, were at greater risk of in-hospital mortality than patients previously diagnosed with diabetes. Several possible mechanisms may explain this observation. Patients with diabetes are more likely to receive insulin and/or oral antidiabetic drugs for hyperglycaemia before and during acute illness [5] , and such treatments may reduce the rise in free radicals and inflammation, and also decrease coagulability because of a reduced production of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) activity and proinsulin-like molecules [6] . On the other hand, higher IL-6 serum levels may blunt the effects of TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients as per numerous observations. Initially, severe Covid-19 patients might experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a negative prognostic factor for survival in such patients [1, 2, 7, 8] . CRS damps down type-1 interferon (IFN) responses in airway and alveolar epithelial cells, thereby allowing rapid viral replication while also attracting an excessive number of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells and natural-killer (NK) cells into the lungs [7] . As a consequence, the result could be an overactivation of innate responses through a cytokine-driven vicious cycle [8] . In addition, pulmonary injury might be assisted by diffuse alveolar damage, dysregulated coagulation and pulmonary fibrinolysis due to the overwhelming presence of the systemic circulation to cause extrapulmonary manifestations and a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [8] .",

Similarly, SARS has also been characterized by exuberant inflammatory responses and lung damage [8] . A previous study, using a mouse model of SARS, demonstrated that the rapid kinetics of SARS-CoV replication and a delay in type-1 IFN signalling promoted inflammatory monocyte/macrophage accumulation, resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage and suboptimal T-cell responses [8] .",

In addition, IL-6 promotes T-cell population expansion/activation and B-cell 7 differentiation, and also regulates lipid metabolism and insulin resistance leading to systemic organ damage [8] . In this setting, TCZ through its targeting of the IL-6 pathways is a blocker of the IL-6 signal transduction pathway and can be used in patients with severe Covid-19 [8] . Notably, based on a previous study conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TCZ efficacy was shown to be inversely proportional to baseline IL-6 levels [9] . Moreover, in Covid-19 patients, TCZ treatment led to a significant decline in inflammatory markers, with radiological improvement and reduced ventilator support requirements [10] . Ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating the safety/efficacy effects of TCZ according to screening and monitoring parameters [11] .",
