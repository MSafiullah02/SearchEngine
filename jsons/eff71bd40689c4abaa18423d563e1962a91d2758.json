In humans, histologlcally similar lesions may Involve the pinnae, nose, trachea, joints, eyes and heart, and the disease Is termed relapsing polychondritis. The cat reported had a history of corneal damage, resulting in corneal vascularlsation and opacity, eyelid distortion, necessitating an entroplon operation, and radiological evidence of mild cardiac enlargement. The ear disease responded rapidly to treatment with prednisolone and, apart from slight thickening and curling of the pinnae, the cat remained normal and pain-free. After two years, the prednisolone was withdrawn, and there was no recurrence of the condition in a follow-up period of 14 months.",
