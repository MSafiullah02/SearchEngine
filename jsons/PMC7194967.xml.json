Particularly during the early stages of a novel infectious disease outbreak, quarantine can be applied to large numbers of people. For example, in Toronto during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, 100 people were placed into quarantine for every case that was diagnosed.3 The early stages of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak have already witnessed the quarantining of entire cities within China,4 whereas thousands of foreign nationals leaving China are being asked to enter quarantine at home or in government facilities upon return to their home countries.",

For students, however, having an additional job alongside being a student did not appear to be a relevant factor.13 Being a healthcare worker was associated with higher adherence to quarantine during the SARS outbreak in Canada.14 Within student populations, no differences were found in accordance with gender, age, full or part-time status, residing on or off campus or quarantine location.13\n",

When five schools in an Australian city were closed during the H1N1 pandemic, a lack of clear quarantine instructions led some of those affected to invent their own quarantine rules,15 seemingly based on what they thought constituted a visible symptom of the disease, the acceptable degree of contact with those infected and the risk of being affected or of infecting others. Parents in an Australian city who understood what they were meant to do during the quarantine period for H1N1 had significantly higher adherence to quarantine.16 Caleo et al.17 found that people in Sierra Leone who were put under quarantine due to Ebola also had problems adhering to protocols because they did not understand what \u2018isolation\u2019 meant. Adherence to quarantine in Taiwan during the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with higher awareness of the pandemic.18\n",

Relatedly, increased adherence to quarantine in Australia during the H1N1 pandemic occurred when there was an influenza case in the household, which again may be associated with increased perceived risk of disease transmission now that the disease is amongst family members, or an increase in knowledge of the disease and quarantine protocol.23\n",
