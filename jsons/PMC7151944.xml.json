In some cases the particles also include additional structures. Isolated virus nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, may cause infection and initiate a synthesis of complete virus particles. The nucleic acid is infectious, however, only in cases when the complete virus particle does not contain any enzyme(s) needed to initiate replication (see\nChapter 3). Free isolated infectious nucleic acid is an ineffective contagious entity. One single break in the nucleic acid molecule induced by physical or chemical factors will lead to the loss of its infectious capacity. It is therefore of importance to their survival that viral infectious agents have their nucleic acid packed into a protective protein shell during the transport between cells.",

This nucleic acid is either RNA or DNA, but never both kinds simultaneously. The nucleic acid is surrounded by a protein shell, called capsid (from L. capsa = box). In the case of many viruses the nucleoprotein complex represents the whole virus particle. The virus particle is referred to as the virion. In more complex viruses further (one or more) enclosing structure(s) occur. This component is structurally similar to cellular membranes and is referred to as the envelope. An envelope is composed of proteins specific to the virus and lipids and carbohydrates which are taken preformed from the infected cell. Even the more complex virus particles do not contain organelle structures equivalent to, for example, mitochondria and lysosomes of cells. If strict definitions were applied, a virus should not be called a microorganism. However, for practical reasons, viruses are included in the group of microorganisms.",

The largest virions have dimensions of 320 \u00d7 270 \u00d7 120 nm, a size corresponding to that of certain forms of the smallest bacteria (mycoplasmas), whereas the diameter of the smallest virions is about 20 nm. The difference in volume is 5000-fold. In spite of this variation in dimensions, viruses have common features which motivates their classification as one common category of infectious agent. The limited size of virions allowed a distinction to be made between bacteria and viruses as cellular infectious agents in early studies. Virions were found to be capable of passing through filters which retained bacteria and they were therefore classed as being ultrafiltrable. Furthermore, bacteria were characterized by light microscopy whereas virus particles, because of their limited size, could not be detected. Information about the morphology and dimensions of virions could be clarified firstly through electron-microscopic analysis. Originally it was possible to get only a rough impression of the size and form of virus particles. In 1956 the negative contrast technique for electron microscopy was introduced. Instead of being stained with electron-dense substances, the particles were suspended in a contrast solution. With this technique new possibilities for detailed characterization of virus morphology became available.",

The fact that virus particles were giant molecules with a capacity to crystallize caused extensive discussion about whether a virus should be considered as live or dead materia. The extracellular virus particle which lacks energy-providing systems and has no capacity, or only a limited capacity, for independent metabolism obviously must be considered as a lifeless unit. Since it also lacks capacity for active movement, the transport of virions in time and space from cell to cell is a chance event. If a virion comes into contact with a susceptible cell, however, a sequence of events is initiated which fulfils all definitions of life, i.e. the reproduction of genetic material which is incorporated into new transport particles. The question about live or dead material becomes more complicated when we are dealing with defective viruses which have a capacity to replicate only in cells which concomitantly are infected with another virus (see\nChapter 12).",

It is composed of 20 triangular facets combined so that the structure has 12 corners (vertices) and 30 edges (Figure 2.2)\n. The building stones in an icosahedral shell are put together in accordance with strict mathematical rules. They can be placed in edges and corners and on the triangular facets or only within the latter. Disregarding the location there is a rule saying that the total number of structural units must be a multiple of 60. The structural proteins of the capsid have a molecular weight which varies between 15000 and 130000. Individual molecules cannot be morphologically identified when they form a part of a capsid. However, groups of structural units can be identified and such morphological units are called capsomers since they represent a part of the capsid. In occasional cases capsomers are formed by 2 or 3 structural units and the whole capsid may contain for example 60 capsomers (Figure 2.4)\n. The most common situation is that the icosahedron is formed by a combination of 12 capsomers each containing 5 structural units localized at the vertices of the capsid and in addition a varying but fixed number of capsomers containing 6 structural units. Different theoretically possible numbers of capsomers are summarized in Figure 2.3.\nIt is of interest to note that nature has used a large number of the different theoretically possible lower capsomer numbers. Figure 2.4 gives examples of virions with 72 and 252 capsomers. The number of different structural components increases with increasing size of virions. Larger capsids enclose nucleic acid combined with one or more proteins in a structure occasionally referred to as core structure.\n",

However, increase in size reduces the stability of the structure and further accentuates the risk of incorrect assembly. For this reason, perhaps, animal viruses with a diameter exceeding 80 nm usually have another enclosing structure. This structure has a membrane-like character and is referred to as the envelope. An envelope can enclose a nucleocapsid with helical or icosahedral symmetry (Figure 2.5)\n. The envelope has a similar composition to membrane structures of cells. On the inside of the membrane there is a stabilizing skeleton protein, also called matrix protein, and on the outside there are projections of varying size and form depending upon the kind of virus. The morphologically identifiable projections are called peplomers (Gk. peplos = drape). Each peplomer is composed of a few structural units. The envelope appears not to be the loose sack-like structure which was originally believed. It seems that the peplomers are located in the envelope and have a certain symmetrical relationship to each other. Furthermore, the peplomers communicate through the lipid layer with the matrix protein and this protein in turn is in direct contact with the nucleocapsid which, when it has a helical structure, is wound up in a strictly organized fashion.",

Since the virus is a cellular parasite it is obvious that the first primitive cells must have arrived on the scene before viruses made their entrance. Two major mechanisms of the origin of viruses have been discussed. One possible mechanism is that the virus represents a cellular structure which has acquired independence. This structure thus would have developed a capacity to occur in a stable particulate form, to be transmitted from cell to cell, and also to initiate its own replication. The other possible mechanism is that the virus has derived from more complex organisms through a retrograde (backwards) evolution. Primitive bacteria which discovered that there was a certain comfort in replicating in nucleated cells might as a consequence of increasing laziness have made themselves extremely dependent on the metabolism of cells. Certain data indicate that different viruses may have different evolutionary origin. In spite of this it is worthwhile to jointly classify all viruses. The different possible variations in genome strategy and particle structure for such a relatively simplified infectious agent as a virus must of necessity be rather restricted and, independently of evolutionary origin, principal similarities will dominate over the dissimilarities.",

This method of classifying viruses still has a certain relevance regarding the syndromes and epidemiology of virus diseases.

            "text": "By considering these different properties it is possible to identify all the major groups of animal viruses (Figure 2.6). A useful classification of viruses of a different host origin also can be achieved. In many cases the grouping obtained by use of these properties is verified by the existence of unique biochemical features shared between members within individual groups. Many virus groups contain a large number of members which in turn can be divided into subgroups. It is therefore necessary to use several hierarchial levels in the classification. From a practical point of view the following levels are utilized: family, genus, type (species). Regrettably the term \u2018group\u2019 is used in daily language to cover both families and genera. The definition of the term \u2018type\u2019 (species) has been and still is a matter for debate. A practical definition is to identify two virus strains as belonging to the same type if an infection with one of the strains provides immunological protection against a subsequent infection by the other strain. Thus it is by use of immunological techniques that a virus type is defined. Different strains of a certain virus type occasionally display a different capacity to cause disease both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. It is therefore of interest to characterize a virus isolate by more refined serological techniques or by other methods. An example of the latter is the characterization of the nucleic acid of viruses, e.g. by fragmentation of virus DNA by restriction enzymes and determination of the number and sizes of the fragments obtained. By such procedures different subtypes of a virus may be identified.",

The latter virus is generally referred to as SV40 (simian virus 40). Papillomavirus and the other members of the family represent two separate genera in which the virions have different diameters, 55 and 45 nm, respectively. All viruses in the family have the same principal composition, however; circular DNA combined with cellular histones and surrounded by a capsid with 72 capsomers (Figure 2.4a). In man papovaviruses may cause warts and in addition certain other unusual diseases. The importance of these viruses concerning the appearance of tumours in man and animals is currently being studied.",
