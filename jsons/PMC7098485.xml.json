On admission, 20\u201351% of patients reported as having at least one comorbidity, with diabetes (10\u201320%), hypertension (10\u201315%) and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (7\u201340%) being most common [3, 4, 6]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of any comorbidity has been associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with H7N9 infection [13]. Similar with influenza [14\u201318], Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [19] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [20\u201328], Covid-19 more readily predisposed to respiratory failure and death in susceptible patients [4, 5]. Nonetheless, previous studies have been certain limitations in study design including the relatively small sample sizes and single center observations. Studies that address these limitations is needed to explore for the factors underlying the adverse impact of Covid-19.",

After careful medical chart review, we compiled the clinical data of laboratory-confirmed hospitalised cases from 575 hospitals (representing 31.7% of the certified hospitals for admitting patients with Covid-19) between December 11th, 2019 and January 31st, 2020. The diagnosis of Covid-19 was made based on the World Health Organization interim guidance [29]. Because of the urgency of data extraction, complete random sampling could not be applied in our settings. All clinical profiles outside Hubei province were centrally provided by the National Health Commission. Three respiratory experts from Guangzhou were dispatched to Wuhan for raw data extraction from Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital where most cases in Wuhan were located. Our cohort included 132 patients from Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital, and one each from 338 hospitals. Our cohort represented the overall situation as of Jan 31st, taking into account the proportion of hospitals (\u223c one fourth) and patient number (13.5%, 1590/11 791 cases) as well as the broad coverage (covering all major provinces/cities/autonomous regions). Confirmed cases denoted the patients whose high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay findings for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were positive [3]. See Online Supplement for further details. The interval between the potential earliest date of transmission source (wildlife, suspected or confirmed cases) contacts and the potential earliest date of symptom onset (i.e., cough, fever, fatigue, myalgia) was adopted to calculate the incubation period. In light that the latest date was recorded in some patients who had continuous exposure to contamination sources, the incubation periods of less than 1.0 day would not be included in our analysis. The incubation periods were summarised based on the patients who had delineated the specific date of exposure.",

Manifestations on chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) was summarised by integrating the documentation or description in medical charts and, if available, a further review by our medical staff. Major disagreement of the radiologic manifestations between the two reviewers was resolved by consultation with another independent reviewer. Because the disease severity reportedly predicted poorer clinical outcomes of avian influenza [13], patients were classified as having severe or non-severe Covid-19 based on the 2007 American Thoracic Society Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines [30], taking into account its global acceptance for severity stratification of community-acquired pneumonia although no validation was conducted in patients with viral pneumonia. The predictive ability of the need for ICU admission and mortality has been validated previously [31, 32]. Briefly, severe cases denoted at least one major criterion (septic shock requiring vasoactive medications, or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation), or at least three minor criteria (respiratory rate being 30 times per minute or greater, oxygen index being 250 or lower, multiple lobe infiltration, delirium or loss of consciousness, blood urea nitrogen level being 20 mg\u00b7dL\u22121 or greater, blood leukocyte count being 4000 per deciliter or lower, blood platelet count being 100 000 per deciliter or lower, body temperature being lower than 36 degrees, hypotension necessitating vasoactive drugs for maintaining blood pressure).",

Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with the composite endpoints, with the hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) being reported. Our findings indicated that the statistical assumption of proportional hazards analysis was not violated. Moreover, Cox regression model was considered more appropriate than logistic regression model because it has taken into account the potential impact of the various duration of follow-up from individual patients. The age and smoking status were adjusted for in the proportional hazards regression model because they have been recognised as the risk factors of comorbidities even in the general population.

Despite considerable variations in the proportion in individual studies due to the limited sample size and the region where patients were managed, circulatory diseases (including hypertension and coronary heart diseases) remained the most common category of comorbidity [3\u20137]. Apart from circulatory diseases, endocrine diseases such as diabetes were also common in patients with Covid-19. Notwithstanding the commonness of circulatory and endocrine comorbidities, patients with Covid-19 rarely reported as having comorbid respiratory diseases (particularly COPD). The reasons underlying this observation have been scant, but could have arisen from the lack of awareness and the lack of spirometric testing in community settings that collectively contributed to the under-diagnosis of respiratory diseases [33]. It should be stressed that the observed frequency of comorbidity may also reflect the transmission dynamics within particular age groups, case detection or testing practices or hospital admission policies during the early phases of the epidemic. Consistent with recent reports [3\u20137], the percentage of patients with comorbid renal disease and malignancy was relatively low. Our findings have therefore added to the existing literature the spectrum of comorbidities in patients with Covid-19 based on the larger sample sizes and representativeness of the whole patient population in China.",

The most common comorbidities associated with poorer prognosis included diabetes [25, 29], hypertension [28], respiratory diseases [19, 28], cardiac diseases [19, 28], pregnancy [16], renal diseases [28] and malignancy [19]. Our findings suggested that, similar with other severe acute respiratory outbreaks, comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predisposed to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with Covid-19. The strength of association between different comorbidities and the prognosis, however, was less consistent when compared with the literature reports [16, 19, 25, 28]. For instance, the risk between cardiac diseases and poor clinical outcomes of influenza, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections was inconclusive [16, 19, 25, 28]. Except for diabetes, no other comorbidities were identified to be the predictors of poor clinical outcomes in patients with MERS-CoV infections [25]. Few studies, however, have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations. Kulscar et al. showed that MERS-CoV infections resulted in prolonged airway inflammation, immune cell dysfunction and an altered expression profile of inflammatory mediators in diabetic mice models [27]. A network-based analysis indicated that SARS-CoV infections led to immune dysregulation that could help explain the escalated risk of cardiac diseases, bone diseases and malignancy [34]. Therefore, immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation might be the key drivers of the poor clinical outcomes in patients with Covid-19 but await verification in more mechanistic studies.",

Under-reporting of comorbidities, which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing, might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis. Under-reporting of comorbidities could also lead to over-estimation of strength of association with adverse outcome. However, significant under-reporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature [3\u20137] and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission. The relatively low age might help explain the low prevalence of COPD in our cohort. Moreover, the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing. More studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted. Caution should be exercised when extrapolating our findings to other countries where there are outbreaks of Covid-19 since the prevalence of comorbidities may differ among different countries. Therefore, future studies that include an external validation of the results would be desirable. Although the temperature and systolic blood pressure differed between some subgroups, they were unlikely to be clinically relevant. Finally, because of the rapid evolving outbreak globally, ongoing studies with the inclusion of more patients would be needed to increase the statistical power and lend support to subgroup analyses stratified by the specific comorbidities (i.e. COPD) and their association with the risk of death.",
