It is therefore considered to be a potent chemical weapon against bacteria, viruses, and other pathogenic microorganisms that may invade the bee colony. Also, bees use propolis as an embalming substance, to mummify invaders such as other insects, that have been killed and are too heavy to remove from the colony (Bankova et al. 2005a; Wagh 2013) . Humans have certainly observed the behaviour of honeybees and the ways in which they use propolis in their hives, which might have inspired interest in the biological properties of bee glue. Therefore, it is not surprising that propolis has become a subject of interest in natural product studies in recent times. The literature on propolis is vast and even a lengthy review cannot cover everything, but can only give an indication of the areas of interest in propolis research.

For a comprehensive review of the history of propolis use see Kuropatnicki et al. (2013) . Despite such early use, propolis is often still considered a \"folk medicine\" and remains an unofficial drug in the field of pharmacy (Valenzuela-Barra et al. 2015; Kuropatnicki et al. 2013; Toreti et al. 2013) . However, over the last two decades, its use has begun to gain scientific backing. It is considered to be a promising natural source for the discovery of new pharmaceutical products to treat several types of diseases. Thus, it has been subjected to intensive studies investigating its antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immune-stimulating, and anticancer properties (Banskota et al. 2001b) . Nevertheless, propolis is still not considered an official conventional medicine in healthcare because of a lack of standardization of its composition due to the variability of its chemical components and thus its biological activity, which varies according to the different geographic locations of its collection (Silva-Carvalho et al. 2015) . In addition, there is presently inadequate data regarding therapeutic efficacy from clinical trial studies involving propolis.

Bankova stated that knowledge of the chemical composition of propolis leads to a prediction of its biological activities (Bankova et al. 2005a) . In general, the term biological activity describes the pharmacological activity of a substance in a living organism. However, when the therapeutic product is a complex mixture, the biological activity could be broadly based due to a multiplicity of active ingredients and thus the product could have many therapeutic indications (Jackson et al. 2007) . This is the case with propolis, which contains many active components, leading to numerous pharmacological activities. Propolis has been demonstrated to be safe and non-toxic for human use. However, some cases of allergic reactions such as contact dermatitis have been reported by beekeepers. There is some variability in the toxic and safe dosages of propolis reported by different studies, probably due to a lack of standardized extraction methods (Burdock 1998) . The effectiveness of propolis preparations is dependent on the method of preparation, including the solvents used during the extraction process (Silva-Carvalho et al. 2015) .

The body also has natural enzymatic antioxidants, which include superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, and non-enzymatic antioxidants including lipid soluble, e.g. vitamin E, and water soluble, e.g. vitamin C and glutathione, compounds for defence against the harmful effects of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Valko et al. 2007) . A free radical in the body is simply an atom or molecule containing one or more unpaired electrons in its outer orbital, such as the oxygen atom shown in Fig. 7 allows the ROS to participate in many reactions with other free radicals. In low to moderate concentrations, ROS play vital roles in the biological processes of the human body, including stimulating pathways in response to changes in the extracellular environment (cellular signalling), mitogenic response, and immune response for defence against infections in the intracellular environment (Valko et al. 2007; Halliwell and Gutteridge 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 452, "end": 471, "text": "(Valko et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1045, "text": "(Valko et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1076, "text": "Halliwell and Gutteridge 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 628, "end": 634, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "The Antioxidant Properties of Propolis"}, {"text": "As can be seen in Fig. 7 .2, oxygen molecules can accept energy in the form of electrons as an outcome of an inflammation process, leading to the production of oxygen-centred free radicals also known as ROS. The generation of ROS is . When the oxygen molecule accepts an electron, it becomes a superoxide radical which, upon further electronation, produces peroxide. The latter can undergo further reactions with electrons and protons to produce potent hydroxyl radicals. Antioxidants act by donating protons (H+) to free radicals, leading to the formation of water, as shown in Fig. 7 Quercetin reduces the free radical to water while it is oxidised to an ortho-quinone regulated by the action of the enzyme RO synthase and over production results from both the mitochondrial electron transport chain and excessive production of NADH (Valko et al. 2007) . Once formed, these ROS are highly reactive and produce a chain of deleterious reactions resulting in damage to cell structures (lipids, membranes, proteins and DNA) and modulation of many biological processes including inflammation and immune response. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and physiologically active antioxidant metabolites in the body (Valko et al. 2007 ). The excessive production of ROS may be responsible for causing a large number of diseases, such as cancer (Kinnula and Crapo 2004) , cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, ROS can induce mutations or cause direct damage in DNA which leads to cell transformation and the possibility of developing a variety of malignant conditions (Valko et al. 2007) . Also, active free radicals are the main factor involved in cellular aging and are responsible for the development of many CNS related medical conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Antioxidant agents can serve as a defensive factor against free radicals in neuronal cells (Metodiewa and Ko\u015bka 1999; Martin and Grotewiel 2006; Valko et al. 2007 ). Many scientific papers have been published on the antioxidant effects of propolis (Bittencourt et al. 2015; Olczyk et al. 2013; Piccinelli et al. 2013) . The relationship between antioxidant activity and the chemical composition of propolis from different origins has been investigated by several authors (Isla et al. 2001; Kalogeropoulos et al. 2009; Mello and Hubinger 2012; Piccinelli et al. 2013) . These studies confirmed that the significant antioxidant activity of propolis is related to the high content of polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, in the sample. Additionally, it has been reported that the essential oil constituents of Thymus vulgaris (thyme) could act as antioxidant agents (Deans et al. 1992) . Since one of the main components of propolis has been proven to be essential oils Marcucci 1995) , it might be possible that these components contribute to its antioxidant effects. The study conducted by Kumazawa et al. suggested that propolis could act as an antioxidant agent due to the presence of anti-oxidative compounds such as kaempferol and phenethyl caffeate ).

Shimazawa et al. assayed and reported the neuroprotective effect of green Brazilian propolis both in vitro and in vivo. First, the in vitro assay was conducted by exposure of neuronal cell cultures to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), followed by addition of propolis to the neuronal cells. On the other hand, the in vivo experiments studied the effect of propolis against lipid peroxidation in the forebrain of mice and DPPH-induced free radical production (Shimazawa et al. 2005) . Furthermore, a recent study found that Turkish propolis contains phenolic components which have the ability to minimize DNA damage by inhibiting the effects of H 2 O 2 in cultured fibroblasts (Darendelioglu et al. 2016 ). An effective natural antioxidant agent such as propolis could provide a safe and novel treatment for oxidative stress-related diseases, especially in elderly people whose conditions tend to be complex in nature and include cases of neurodegeneration corresponding to aging.

Several studies have been performed to evaluate this property against a large group of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; both aerobic and anaerobic types. The bacteria studied are summarized in Table 7 .3. These bacteria were either from laboratory collections or isolated from clinical samples. The studies used propolis of different geographical origins and chemical composition, and employed different experimental approaches such as disc diffusion and disc dilution to investigate the antibacterial activity. In the disc diffusion method, antibacterial activity is determined by measuring the diameter of the bacterial growth inhibition zone in the agar layer surrounding a disc containing propolis extracts (Kujumgiev et al. 1999) . The dilution method is used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) which are, respectively, the lowest concentrations that inhibit visible bacterial growth and the lowest concentration that kills bacteria (Grange and Davey 1990; Stepanovi\u0107 et al. 2003) . The vast majority of antibacterial activity studies were carried out using in vitro bioassays, as mentioned above. Although the composition of propolis differs considerably depending on its botanical origin, all examined types of propolis have revealed strong antibacterial activity (Kujumgiev et al. 1999; Bankova 2005b; Bankova et al. 2007) .

The inhibition of poliovirus propagation was observed through a plaque reduction test and a multistep virus replication assay. At a concentration of 30 \u03bcg/ml, propolis reduced the titer of HSV by 1000, whereas VSV and adenovirus were less susceptible.

Propolis is believed to possess antimicrobial, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects (Castaldo and Capasso 2002) . These properties probably enhance cell proliferation in the skin and activate remodelling of the skin tissue. The wound healing process is a natural reaction of the body involving a sequence of several biochemical factors and multiple cellular reactions which can be divided into four stages, namely, hemostasis (blood clotting), inflammation, proliferation of new skin tissue, and remodelling of mature tissue (Gurtner et al. 2008) . Hemostasis is an initial natural reaction that occurs immediately in the first few minutes of injury. During this stage, platelets in the blood accumulate at the site of injury where they release chemical signals. These signals cause fibrin, a blood protein, to form a mesh that works as a glue to bind the platelets, leading to the formation of thrombi (blood clots), which seal the injury and control bleeding. Immediately after formation of the blood clot the inflammation process starts and immune cells such as macrophages and inflammatory cells such as neutrophils secrete large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. The generated ROS arrive in the wound lesion and act as a defence system against pathogens. However, any excess amount of superoxides may damage the surrounding normal tissue, such as occurs in diabetes. The proliferative phase then occurs two or three days after the injury and involves the movement of epithelial cells until they meet each other from either migration side. This occurs via stimulation of fibroblasts in the dermis layer along with keratinocytes in the epidermis. New blood vessels start to form to provide nutrition and oxygen to repair the injured tissue. Then, proliferative fibroblasts begin to secrete matrix proteins and collagen to build up the extracellular matrix that acts as a connective tissue to form initial dermal granulation tissue. After that, the fibroblasts differentiate into myo-fibroblasts which cause contraction of the wound size due to increases in collagen synthesis relative to the proliferative process. Lastly, the remodelling and maturation phase occurs, which is characterised by scar formation as a result of replacement of type III collagen by type I collagen (Guo and DiPietro 2010; Gurtner et al. 2008) . The wound healing process is illustrated in Fig. 7.4 . Some recent studies have confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of propolis in different types of wounds, such as gastric ulcers, surgical wounds, infected wounds and burns (de Barros et al. 2007; Barroso et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2013 ).
