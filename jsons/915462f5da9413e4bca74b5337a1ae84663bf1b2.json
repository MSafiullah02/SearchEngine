A woman on the Indonesian island of Sumatra caught the virus from poultry in May of 2006 and transmitted the virus to her 10-year-old nephew, which was then transmitted to other relatives. Seven of eight family members who caught the disease died. This incident showed that there is a serious threat of an H5N1 influenza pandemic that could spread quickly and have a high and rapid mortality Organization (WHO) uses six phases of pandemic alert to estimate the level of a threat. In December 2007, H5N1 was in phase 3, because it is a new influenza virus subtype that is causing disease in humans, but is not yet spreading efficiently and sustainably among humans. However, there is no way of knowing when such creased in frequency over time. This pattern is not surprising because fast-moving pandemics require close contact between groups of people. Over time, people due to faster modes of transportation.",

The 1918-1919 influenza virus had a mortality rate of 2.5%, significantly higher than previous influenza epidemics, which were less than 0.1% (Taubenberger and Morens 2006; Billings 1997) . Moreover, unlike other flu pandemics, almost half of the influenza-related deaths were in young adults, 20-40 years of age (Taubenberger and Morens 2006) . In this regard, the 1918-1919 virus was like HIV/AIDS, rate (Waters 2007) . Human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 influenza virus was also suspected in Pakistan in November 2007 (McPherson 2007 .

While mother-to-child transmission, transmission by contaminated needles and transmission through blood transfusion make it possible to see the impact on other age groups, the bulk of HIV transmission is still due to sexual contact. It is still unclear why the Spanish Flu affected the most able-bodied persons at a higher rate. One plausible hypothesis is that the flu itself was not the cause of their deaths. Rather, the virus produced a reaction that caused the patients' own organs to attack the body. Since able-bodied persons have the most vigorous organs, they were affected the most. It is also important to remember that the Spanish Flu was not identified as flu until more than a decade later. Thus, most of what we know today about the Spanish Flu is the result of postmortem analysis of the disease.",

            "text": "There are several theories about how zoonosis (the process by which a virus is transferred between animals and humans) caused SIV to mutate into HIV. The most commonly accepted theory is the \"hunter\" theory. According to this theory, SIVcpz was transferred to humans when hunters killed and ate chimpanzees or when the chimpanzee's blood infected the hunters' cuts or wounds. Most of the time, the hunter's body would have fought off SIV. However, in a few instances, SIV would adapt to its new human host to become HIV-1. This \"hunter\" theory finds support in the existence of several different early strains of HIV, each with a slightly different genetic make-up (with the most common strain being HIV-1 group M). Every time the virus passed successfully from a chimpanzee to a human, it would develop in a slightly different way and thus produce a slightly different Although clear cases of AIDS were identified in the early 1980s in the United States, a plasma sample taken in 1959 from an adult male living in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo showed the presence of HIV-1 (Zhou et al., 1998) . Similarly, HIV-2 seems to have come from Guinea-Bissau. By analyzing samples of two different subtypes of HIV-2 (A and B) taken from infected humans and SIV samples taken from sooty mangabeys, Vandamme et al. (2003) concluded that both subtypes A and B had passed into humans in the 1950s (with a margin of error of 15 years). It is entirely possible that transmission from monkeys to named because of the time it takes to produce any adverse effect on the body. Lentiviruses are in turn part of a larger group of viruses known as retroviruses. Retroviruses have been found in a number of different animals, including cats, sheep, horses, monkeys and cattle. humans had occurred decades, or even centuries, earlier. However, if groups of infected humans did not come into close contact with other groups, they might have died out.",

Over time, the quantity of HIV in the blood increases and the number of CD4 cells decreases. Some people begin to have symptoms within months, while others can be without symptoms for more than 10 years. However, the virus continues to multiply, infecting and killing the cells of the immune system, and can be transmitted to other people through unprotected sex, blood transfusions or organ transplants and the sharing of needles, even though the infected person has no symptoms. When the immune system is sufficiently weakened, it is no longer able to fight off infections caused by common bacteria, virus, fungi and parasites, such as: mycobacterium avium complex (which causes night sweats, weight loss, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea and anemia); tuberculosis (which causes night sweats, weight loss, loss of energy, poor appetite, fever and a cough), salmonellosis (which causes diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain and cramps); bacillary angiomatosis (which causes skin lesions and can affect internal organs, including the brain, bone marrow, heart, lungs, larynx, tongue, esophagus, stomach, colon, diaphragm, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, uterine cervix and vulva); cyto-megalovirus (which can cause fever, fatigue, rash, chills, fatigue, headache and blindness); viral hepatitis (which can cause loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, fatigue and aching in the abdomen); herpes (which can cause painful blisters, headache, muscle ache and fever); human papillomavirus (which can cause genital warts and pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, vulva, anus or penis); progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (which can cause mental deterioration, vision loss, speech disturbances, a loss of coordination, paralysis and coma); candidiasis (which can cause burning pain in the mouth or throat, pain and difficulty when swallowing and vaginal yeast infections); cryptococcal meningitis (which can cause severe headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, sensitivity to bright light, stiff neck, seizures, confusion, behavioral changes and coma); pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (which can cause fever, chest tightness, shortness of breath, lack of energy, dry cough and weight loss); toxoplasmosis (which can cause damage to the brain, eyes or other organs); and cryptosporidiosis (which can cause diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, fever, nausea and vomiting). HIV-positive people can also get cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma (which can cause lesions on the skin, mouth, throat, lungs and the intestinal tract) and lymphoma (which can cause fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats and lack of energy).",

However, the degree to which these groups are marginalized varies from one society to the next and within each society. As a sexually transmitted disease, the stigma associated with AIDS further isolates the people who live with this condition and makes HIV difficult to discuss openly. Widespread societal taboos regarding sex, negative attitudes regarding the groups of people most affected by the virus and the fear that is kindled by infectious disease have proved to be powerful allies for a virus whose transmission would be otherwise more easily prevented. The stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and a lack of legal protection against discrimination may deter people from seeking testing and treatment. The lack of access to treatment and information also can discourage people from seeking testing, which in turn can contribute to the spread of the disease.

For example, in 2007 a major revision of HIV/AIDS prevalence in India reduced the estimated number of cases from 5.7 million in 2004 to 2.47 million in 2006. The accuracy of HIV/AIDS estimates is important, both for governments involved in assessing the scale of prevention and treatment needs and for the private sector, particularly the insurance industry. The correct pricing of insurance products requires an accurate assessment of the frequency and South Africa has the most HIV/AIDS cases in the world and one of the highest prevalence rates. Moreover, mortality rates are high and survival probabilities are low, due to a lack of access to treatment. However, the highly developed South African insurance industry was not severely affected by the dramatic rise in HIV/ Africa were short-term policies and South African insurance companies used industry in South Africa has been able to survive HIV/AIDS, this has come at the cost of reduced access to life insurance and limited access to health insurance that might cover part of the cost of treatment for HIV/AIDS.

The severity of the HIV/AIDS crisis in many parts of the developing world, combined with the duplicitous policy of Canada and the United States regarding patent rights, prompted several developing countries to adopt a common position calling for clarifications to the rights of governments to issue compulsory licenses to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all. The resulting Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health also identified a gap in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), under which only countries with adequate pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity could in practice exercise the right to issue compulsory licenses on pharmaceutical products. Two years of multilateral negotiations on this issue ultimately led to a decision to amend the TRIPS Agreement (known as the Paragraph 6 Decision), but it took two more years to adopt the amendment formally and it has yet to be adopted by the two-thirds of the WTO Members required for it to enter into force. However, the most interesting aspect of these negotiations was the extent to which the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which lobbies the US government on behalf of its member companies, succeeded in dictating the US government's position in the negotiations.",

For example, the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) not only created new obstacles to compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical products in several small developing countries, but also overrode the clarifications to the rights of governments that were achieved in the WTO negotiations. When Thailand -a country that did not negotiate this type of free trade agreement with the United Statesexercised its rights under WTO law to issue compulsory licenses on some pharmaceutical products (including antiretroviral drugs for its HIV/AIDS treatment program), the US Trade Representative placed Thailand on its priority watch list of countries and characterized the Thai government's decision as \"further indications of a weakening of respect for patents\". This kind of political pressure from the governments of the major pharmaceutical companies discourages the use of compulsory licensing to increase affordable access to medicine in developing countries and undermines the international rule of law.",

Governments grant patents to inventors on the national level, which means that they only have legal effect in the jurisdictions where the application for a patent has been granted. One of the conditions for granting a patent is that the inventor disclose the data used in the producing the invention. TRIPS established minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property rights in the national laws of WTO Members. TRIPS requires that patents be granted for a minimum of 20 years and that they provide patent owners with the exclusive right to prevent third parties from making, using, selling or importing a patented product without the owner's consent. However, TRIPS allows exceptions to these patent rights, including the right of governments to issue compulsory licenses under certain conditions. A compulsory license authorizes a third party to produce and sell the invention without the patent owner's consent. This exception plays a key role in balancing the rights of patent owners against the needs of consumers of patented products. The right to issue a compulsory license on a patented drug provides countries with bargaining power to extract price concessions for patented drugs or to issue compulsory licenses if price negotiations fail. However, this bargaining power applies only to countries that have the manufacturing capacity to produce generic drugs, since the generic drugs must be used to predominately supply the national market of the country that issues the compulsory license. Countries that lack domestic manufacturing capacity would need to be able to import generics manufactured under compulsory licenses in other countries in order to enjoy a comparable level of bargaining power. The Paragraph 6 Decision established rules to allow this to happen.",

No formal restriction on the countries that are eligible to import exists under the Paragraph 6 system. All WTO members, other than least-developed countries, are required to notify the WTO of their intention to use the Paragraph 6 system. Some countries have made a commitment not to use the Paragraph 6 system as importers, while several others have committed to using the system as importers only in situations of national emergency or extreme urgency. The latter have agreed, in effect, not to use the system simply to lower the general cost of purchasing medicine for public health care systems. No restrictions exist regarding the countries that are eligible to export. The Paragraph 6 system does not apply to countries that have sufficient manufacturing capacity to issue compulsory licenses to meet the needs of their own populations. The question in a given case is whether the importing country has manufacturing capacity for the pharmaceutical product in question. For example, countries like China, India and Brazil, if they lack capacity for a particular medicine, could use the Paragraph 6 system to import drugs from generic manufacturers in other countries. However, where developing countries do have manufacturing capacity, they will have to determine whether and how to use compulsory licensing to reduce the cost of providing treatment by issuing licenses to their own generic manufacturers. When a country issues a compulsory license to its own generic drug manufacturers to serve its own market, the Paragraph 6 Decision will not apply.",
