Biologists can do experiments with plants that they can only dream of being able to perform with animals. And yet, the idea persists among many that botany is boring. Much of the most exciting plant science involves plant viruses, either as experimental tools or in terms of finding ways to prevent infection. And as this section describes, the biology of plant viruses has some striking differences from that of animal viruses. So if you think botany is boring, you probably need to find out more about plant viruses. contributions from some bacteria). From the smallest single-celled alga in the ocean to the largest forest giant tree (and everything in between, such as broccoli), plants are vitally important. Photosynthetic algae in the oceans play a major role in controlling the atmosphere and the climate, and interactions with viruses is one of the major mechanisms which in turn controls the algae. All higher animals depend on the primary productivity of plants for their food. So plants are a big deal, and anything that affects plant growth is of great importance.",

            "text": "In purely economic terms, viruses are only of importance if it is likely that they will affect crops during their commercial lifetime, a likelihood that varies greatly between very short extremes in horticultural production and very long extremes in forestry. Some estimates have put total worldwide cost of plant virus infections as high as $6\u00d71010 per year. The mechanism by which plant viruses are transmitted between hosts is therefore of great importance. There are a number of routes by which plant viruses may be transmitted:\u25aa\nSeeds: These may transmit virus infection either by external contamination of the seed with virus particles or by infection of the living tissues of the embryo. Transmission by this route leads to early outbreaks of disease in new crops that are usually initially focal in distribution but may subsequently be transmitted to the remainder of the crop by other mechanisms (see later).\u25aa\nVegetative propagation/grafting: These techniques are inexpensive and easy methods of plant propagation but provide the ideal opportunity for viruses to spread to new plants.\u25aa\nVectors: Many different groups of living organisms can act as vectors and spread viruses from one plant to another:\u25aaBacteria (e.g., Agrobacterium tumefaciens\u2014the Ti plasmid of this organism has been used experimentally to transmit virus genomes between plants)\u25aaFungi\n\u25aaNematodes\u25aaArthropods (insects; e.g., aphids, leafhoppers, planthoppers, beetles, thrips)\u25aaArachnids (e.g., mites)\n\u25aa\nMechanical: Mechanical transmission of viruses is the most widely used method for experimental infection of plants and is usually achieved by rubbing virus-containing preparations into the leaves, which in most plant species are particularly susceptible to infection. However, this is also an important natural method of transmission. Virus particles may contaminate soil for long periods and be transmitted to the leaves of new host plants as wind-blown dust or as rain-splashed mud.\n",

            "text": "The problems plant viruses face in initiating infections of host cells have already been described (Chapter 4), as has the fact that no known plant virus employs a specific cellular receptor of the types that animal and bacterial viruses use to attach to cells. Transmission of plant viruses by insects is of particular agricultural importance. Huge areas of monoculture and the inappropriate use of pesticides that kill natural predators can result in massive population booms of pest insects such as aphids. Plant viruses rely on a mechanical breach of the integrity of a cell wall to directly introduce a virus particle into a cell. This is achieved either by the vector associated with transmission of the virus or simply by mechanical damage to cells. Transfer by insect vectors is a particularly efficient means of virus transmission. In some instances, viruses are transmitted mechanically from one plant to the next by the vector and the insect is only a means of distribution, through flying or being carried on the wind for long distances (sometimes hundreds of miles). Insects that bite or suck plant tissues are the ideal means of transmitting viruses to new hosts\u2014a process known as nonpropagative transmission. However, in other cases (e.g., many plant rhabdoviruses), the virus may also infect and multiply in the tissues of the insect (propagative transmission) as well as those of host plants. In these cases, the vector serves as a means not only of distributing the virus but also of amplifying the infection.",

            "text": "Initially, most plant viruses multiply at the site of infection, giving rise to localized symptoms such as necrotic spots on the leaves. The virus may subsequently be distributed to all parts of the plant either by direct cell-to-cell spread or by the vascular system, resulting in a systemic infection involving the whole plant. However, the problem these viruses face in reinfection and recruitment of new cells is the same as the one they faced initially\u2014how to cross the barrier of the plant cell wall. Plant cell walls necessarily contain channels called plasmodesmata that allow plant cells to communicate with each other and to pass metabolites between them. However, these channels are too small to allow the passage of virus particles or genomic nucleic acids. Many (if not most) plant viruses have evolved specialized movement proteins that modify the plasmodesmata. One of the best known examples of this is the 30-k protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). This protein is expressed from a subgenomic mRNA (Figure 3.13), and its function is to modify plasmodesmata causing genomic RNA coated with 30-k protein to be transported from the infected cell to neighboring cells (Figure 6.1\n). Other viruses, such as cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV; Comoviridae) have a similar strategy but employ a different molecular mechanism. In CPMV, the 58-/48-k proteins form tubular structures allowing intact virus particles to pass from one cell to another (Figure 6.1).",

This is clearly a highly desirable characteristic that is prized by plant breeders, who try to spread this attribute to economically valuable crop strains. There are probably many different mechanisms involved in systemic resistance, but in general terms there is a tendency of these processes to increase local necrosis when substances such as proteases and peroxidases are produced by the plant to destroy the virus and to prevent its spread and subsequent systemic infection. An example of this is the tobacco N gene, which encodes a cytoplasmic protein with a nucleotide binding site that interferes with the TMV replicase. When present in plants, this gene causes TMV to produce a localized, necrotic infection rather than the systemic mosaic symptoms normally seen. There are many different mechanisms involved in systemic resistance, but in general terms there is a tendency toward increased local necrosis as substances such as proteases and peroxidases are produced by the plant to destroy the virus and to prevent its spread and subsequent systemic disease.",

Serum neutralization stops the spread of virus to uninfected cells and allows other defense mechanisms to mop up the infection. Figure 6.2\nshows a very simplified version of the mammalian humoral response to infection. Virus infection induces at least three classes of antibodies: immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA. IgM is a large, multivalent molecule that is most effective at cross-linking large targets (e.g., bacterial cell walls or flagella) but is probably less important in combating virus infections. In contrast, the production of IgA is very important for initial protection from virus infection. Secretory IgA is produced at mucosal surfaces and results in mucosal immunity, an important factor in preventing infection from occurring. Induction of mucosal immunity depends to a large extent on the way in which antigens are presented to and recognized by the immune system. Similar antigens incorporated into different vaccine delivery systems (see \u201cPrevention and Therapy of Virus Infection,\u201d later) can lead to very different results in this respect, and mucosal immunity is such an important factor that similar vaccines may vary considerably in their efficacy. IgG is probably the most important class of antibody for direct neutralization of virus particles in serum and other body fluids (into which it diffuses).",

This results from the presence of the Fc receptor on the surface of these cells, but as noted in Chapter 4, in some cases opsonization of a virus by the binding of nonneutralizing antibodies can result in enhanced virus uptake. This has been shown to occur with rabies virus, and in the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may promote uptake of the virus by macrophages. Nonphagocytic cells can also destroy antibody-coated viruses via an intracellular pathway involving the TRIM21 protein. Antibody binding also leads to the activation of the complement cascade, which assists in the neutralization of virus particles. Structural alteration of virus particles by complement binding can sometimes be visualized directly by electron microscopy. Complement is particularly important early in virus infection when limited amounts of low-affinity antibody are made\u2014complement enhances the action of these early responses to infection.",

Binding of Fas ligand on the effector cell to Fas (CD95) on the target cell results in activation of cellular proteases known as caspases, which in turn trigger a cascade of events leading to apoptosis.\n",

Interferons do have antiviral properties, but by and large their effects are exerted indirectly via their major function as cellular regulatory proteins. Interferons are immensely potent; less than 50 molecules per cell show evidence of antiviral activity. Hence, following Isaacs and Lindenmann\u2019s initial discovery, many fairly fruitless years were spent trying to purify minute amounts of naturally produced interferon. This situation changed with the development of molecular biology and the cloning and expression of interferon genes, which has led to rapid advances in our understanding over the last 15 years. There are a number of different types of interferons (IFNs):\u25aaIFN-\u03b1: There are at least 15 molecular species of interferon-\u03b1, all of which are closely related; some species differ by only one amino acid. They are synthesized predominantly by lymphocytes. The mature proteins contain 143 amino acids, with a minimum homology of 77% between the different types. All the genes encoding interferon-\u03b1 are located on human chromosome 9, and gene duplication is thought to be responsible for this proliferation of genes.\u25aaIFN-\u03b2: The single gene for interferon-\u03b2 is also located on human chromosome 9. The mature protein contains 145 amino acids and, unlike interferon-\u03b1, is glycosylated, with approximately 30% homology to other interferons. It is synthesized predominantly by fibroblasts.\u25aaOther interferons: The single gene for interferon-\u03b3 is located on human chromosome 12. The mature protein contains 146 amino acids, is glycosylated, and has very low sequence homology to other interferons. It is synthesized predominantly by lymphocytes.

Induction of interferon synthesis results from upregulation of transcription from the interferon gene promoters. There are three main mechanisms involved:\u25aa\nVirus infection: This mechanism is thought to act by the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis that occurs during many virus infections, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of intracellular repressor proteins and hence in increased interferon gene transcription. In general, RNA viruses are potent inducers of interferon while DNA viruses are relatively poor inducers; however, there are exceptions to this rule (e.g., poxviruses are very potent inducers). The molecular events in the induction of interferon synthesis by virus infection are not clear. In some cases (e.g., influenza virus), UV-inactivated virus is a potent inducer; therefore, virus replication is not necessarily required. Induction by viruses might involve perturbation of the normal cellular environment and production of small amounts of double-stranded RNA (see later).\u25aa\nDouble-stranded (ds) RNA: All naturally occurring double-stranded RNAs (e.g., reovirus genomes) are potent inducers of interferon, as are synthetic molecules (e.g., poly I:C); therefore, this process is independent of nucleotide sequence. Single-stranded RNA and double-stranded DNA are not inducers. This mechanism of induction is thought to depend on the secondary structure of the RNA rather than any particular nucleotide sequence.\u25aa\nMetabolic inhibitors: Compounds that inhibit transcription (e.g., actinomycin D) or translation (e.g., cycloheximide) result in induction of interferon. Tumor promoters such as tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are also inducers. Their mechanism of action remains unknown but they almost certainly act at the level of transcription.\n",

However, for pathogenic viruses, a number of critical stages in replication determine the nature of the disease they produce. For all viruses, pathogenic or nonpathogenic, the first factor that influences the course of infection is the mechanism and site of entry into the body (Figure 6.9\n):\u25aa\nThe skin: Mammalian skin is a highly effective barrier against viruses. The outer layer (epidermis) consists of dead cells and therefore does not support virus replication. Very few viruses infect directly by this route unless there is prior injury such as minor trauma or puncture of the barrier, such as insect or animal bites or subcutaneous injections. Some viruses that do use this route include herpes simplex virus and papillomaviruses, although these viruses probably still require some form of disruption of the skin such as small abrasions or eczema.\n\u25aa\nMucosal membranes: The mucosal membranes of the eye and genitourinary (GU) tract are much more favorable routes of access for viruses to the tissues of the body. This is reflected by the number of viruses that can be sexually transmitted; virus infections of the eye are also quite common (Table 6.2\n).\u25aa\nAlimentary canal: Viruses may infect the alimentary canal via the mouth, oropharynx, gut, or rectum, although viruses that infect the gut via the oral route must survive passage through the stomach, an extremely hostile environment with a very low pH and high concentrations of digestive enzymes. Nevertheless, the gut is a highly valued prize for viruses\u2014the intestinal epithelium is constantly replicating and a good deal of lymphoid tissue is associated with the gut, which provides many opportunities for virus replication. Moreover, the constant intake of food and fluids provides ample opportunity for viruses to infect these tissues (Table 6.3\n). To counteract this problem, the gut has many specific (e.g., secretory antibodies) and nonspecific (e.g., stomach acids and bile salts) defense mechanisms.\u25aa\nRespiratory tract: The respiratory tract is probably the most frequent site of virus infection. As with the gut, it is constantly in contact with external virus particles that are taken in during respiration. As a result, the respiratory tract also has defenses aimed at virus infection\u2014filtering of particulate matter in the sinuses and the presence of cells and antibodies of the immune system in the lower regions. Viruses that infect the respiratory tract usually come directly from the respiratory tract of others, as aerosol spread is very efficient: \u201ccoughs and sneezes spread diseases\u201d (Table 6.4\n).\n",

Most viruses are relatively sensitive to factors like heat, drying, and ultraviolet light (sunlight), although a few types are quite resistant to these factors. This is particularly important for viruses that are spread via contaminated water or foodstuffs\u2014not only must they be able to survive in the environment until they are ingested by another host, but as most are spread by the fecal\u2013oral route, they must also be able to pass through the stomach to infect the gut before being shed in the feces. One way of overcoming environmental stress is to take advantage of a secondary vector for transmission between the primary hosts (Figure 6.10\n). As with plant viruses (see earlier), the virus may or may not replicate while in the vector. Viruses without a secondary vector must rely on continued host-to-host transmission and have evolved various strategies to do this (Table 6.5\n):\u25aa\nHorizontal transmission: The direct host-to-host transmission of viruses. This strategy relies on a high rate of infection to maintain the virus population.\u25aa\nVertical transmission: The transmission of the virus from one generation of hosts to the next. This may occur by infection of the fetus before, during, or shortly after birth (e.g., during breastfeeding). More rarely, it may involve direct transfer of the virus via the germ line itself (e.g., retroviruses). In contrast to horizontal transmission, this strategy relies on long-term persistence of the virus in the host rather than rapid propagation and dissemination of the virus.\n",

This initial interaction frequently determines whether the infection will remain localized at the site of entry or spread to become a systemic infection (Table 6.6\n). In some cases, virus spread is controlled by infection of polarized epithelial cells and the preferential release of virus from either the apical (e.g., influenza virus, a localized infection in the upper respiratory tract) or basolateral (e.g., rhabdoviruses, a systemic infection) surface of the cells (Figure 6.11\n). Following primary replication at the site of infection, the next stage may be spread throughout the\nhost. In addition to direct cell\u2013cell contact, there are two main mechanisms for spread throughout the host:\u25aa\nVia the bloodstream: Viruses may get into the bloodstream by direct inoculation; for example, by arthropod vectors, blood transfusion, or intravenous drug abuse (sharing of nonsterilized needles). The virus may travel free in the plasma (e.g., togaviruses, enteroviruses) or in association with red cells (orbiviruses), platelets (HSV), lymphocytes (EBV, CMV), or monocytes (lentiviruses). Primary viremia usually precedes and is necessary for the spread of virus to other parts of the body via the bloodstream and is followed by a more generalized, higher titre secondary viremia as the virus reaches the other target tissues or replicates directly in blood cells.\u25aa\nVia the nervous system: As in the bloodstream, spread of virus to the nervous system is usually preceded by primary viremia. In some cases, spread occurs directly by contact with neurons at the primary site of infection; in other cases, it occurs via the bloodstream. Once in peripheral nerves, the virus can spread to the CNS by axonal transport along neurons. The classic example of this is herpes simplex virus (see \u201cLatent Infection,\u201d later). Viruses can cross synaptic junctions since these frequently contain virus receptors, allowing the virus to jump from one cell to another.\n",

Conversely, picornaviruses cause lysis and death of the cells in which they replicate, leading to fever and increased mucus secretion, in the case of rhinoviruses, and paralysis or death (usually due to respiratory failure due to damage to the central nervous system resulting, in part, from virus replication in these cells) in the case of poliovirus.",

The classic example of this phenomenon is influenza virus, which displays two genetic mechanisms that allow the virus to alter its antigenic constitution:\u25aa\nAntigenic drift: This involves the gradual accumulation of minor mutations (e.g., nucleotide substitutions) in the virus genome that result in subtly altered coding potential and therefore altered antigenicity, leading to decreased recognition by the immune system. This process occurs in all viruses all the time but at greatly different rates; for example, it is much more frequent in RNA viruses than in DNA viruses. In response, the immune system constantly adapts by recognition of and response to novel antigenic structures, but it is always one step behind. In most cases, however, the immune system is eventually able to overwhelm the virus, resulting in clearance.\u25aa\nAntigenic shift: In this process, a sudden and dramatic change in the antigenicity of a virus occurs owing to reassortment of the segmented virus genome with another genome of a different antigenic type (see Chapter 3). This results initially in the failure of the immune system to recognize a new antigenic type, giving the virus the upper hand (Figure 6.12\n).\n",

Adult mice infected in the latter way are killed by the virus, but among those infected by a peripheral route there are two possible outcomes to the infection: some mice die but others survive, having cleared the virus from the body completely. It is not clear what factors determine the survival or death of LCMV-infected mice, but other evidence shows that the outcome is related to the immune response to the virus. In immunosuppressed adult mice infected via the central nervous system (CNS) route, a persistent infection is established in which the virus is not cleared (due to the nonfunctional immune system), but remarkably, these mice are not killed by the virus. If, however, syngeneic LCMV-specific T-lymphocytes (i.e., of the same MHC type) are injected into these persistently infected mice, the animals develop the full pathogenic symptoms of LCMV infection and die. When newborn mice, whose immune systems are immature, are infected via the CNS route, they also develop a persistent infection, but in this case, if they are subsequently injected with syngeneic LCMV-specific T-lymphocytes, they clear the virus and survive the infection. The mechanisms that control these events are not completely understood, but evidently there is a delicate balance between the virus and the host animal, and the immune response to the virus is partly responsible for the pathology of the disease and the death of the animals.",

The presence of D.I. particles can profoundly influence the course and the outcome of a virus infection. In some cases, they appear to moderate pathogenesis, whereas in others they potentiate it, making the symptoms of the disease much more severe.

In latency, the virus is able to downregulate its gene expression and enter an inactive state with strictly limited gene expression and without ongoing virus replication. Latent virus infections typically persist for the entire life of the host. An example of such an infection in humans is herpes simplex virus (HSV). Infection of sensory nerves serving the mucosa results in localized primary replication. Subsequently, the virus travels via axon transport mechanisms further into the nervous system. There, it hides in dorsal root ganglia, such as the trigeminal ganglion, establishing a truly latent infection. The nervous system is an immunologically privileged site and is not patrolled by the immune system in the same way as the rest of the body, but the major factor in latency is the ability of the virus to restrict its gene expression. This eliminates the possibility of recognition of infected cells by the immune system. Restricted gene expression is achieved by tight regulation of \u03b1-gene expression, which is an essential control point in herpesvirus replication (Chapter 5). In the latent state, HSV makes an 8.3 kilobase RNA transcript called the latent RNA or latency-associated transcript (LAT). The LAT is broken down into even smaller strands called microRNAs (miRNAs), and these block the production of proteins that reactivate the virus. Drugs that block production of these miRNAs in theory could \u201cwake up\u201d all the dormant viruses, making them vulnerable to the immune system and to antiviral therapy, and this raises the eventual possibility of a cure for herpes infections. Expression of the LAT promotes neuronal survival after HSV infection by inhibiting apoptosis.

The idea here is to utilize the genome of a well-understood, attenuated virus to express and present antigens to the immune system. Many different viruses offer possibilities for this type of approach. One of the most highly developed systems so far is based on the vaccinia virus (VV) genome. This virus has been used to vaccinate millions of people worldwide in the campaign to eradicate smallpox (see later) and is generally a safe and effective vehicle for antigen delivery. Such vaccines are difficult to produce. No human example is clearly successful yet, although many different trials are currently under way, but VV\u2013rabies recombinants have been used to eradicate rabies in European fox populations. VV-based vaccines have advantages and disadvantages for use in humans\u2014a high percentage of the human population has already been vaccinated during the smallpox eradication campaign, and this lifelong protection may result in poor response to recombinant vaccines. Although generally safe, VV is dangerous in immunocompromised hosts, thus it cannot be used in HIV-infected individuals. A possible solution to these problems may be to use avipoxvirus vectors (e.g., fowlpox or canarypox) as suicide vectors that can only establish abortive infections of mammalian cells and that offer the following advantages:\u25aaExpression of high levels of foreign proteins\u25aaNo danger of pathogenesis (abortive infection)\u25aaNo natural immunity in humans (avian virus)\n",

The objective is to cause loss of virus infectivity without loss of antigenicity. Obviously, this involves a delicate balance. However, inactivated vaccines have certain advantages, such as generally being effective immunogens (if properly inactivated), being relatively stable, and carrying little or no risk of vaccine-associated virus infection (if properly inactivated, but accidents can and do occur). The disadvantage of these vaccines is that it is not possible to produce inactivated vaccines for all viruses, as denaturation of virus proteins may lead to loss of antigenicity (e.g., measles virus). Although relatively effective, killed vaccines are sometimes not as effective at preventing infection as live virus vaccines (see the following), often because they fail to stimulate protective mucosal and cell-mediated immunity to the same extent. A more recent concern is that these vaccines contain virus nucleic acids, which may themselves be a source of infection, either of their own accord (e.g., (+)sense RNA virus genomes) or after recombination with other viruses.",

The effectiveness of attenuated vaccines relies on the fact that a complete spectrum of virus proteins, including nonstructural proteins, are expressed and give rise to cell-mediated immune responses. Live attenuated virus vaccines are viruses with reduced pathogenicity used to stimulate an immune response without causing disease. The vaccine strain may be a naturally occurring virus (e.g., the use of cowpox virus by Edward Jenner to vaccinate against smallpox) or artificially attenuated\nin vitro (e.g., the oral poliomyelitis vaccines produced by Albert Sabin). The advantage of attenuated vaccines is that they are good immunogens and induce long-lived, appropriate immunity. Set against this advantage are their many disadvantages. They are often biochemically and genetically unstable and may either lose infectivity (becoming worthless) or revert to virulence unexpectedly. Despite intensive study, it is not possible to produce an attenuated vaccine to order, and there appears to be no general mechanism by which different viruses can be reliably and safely attenuated. Contamination of the vaccine stock with other, possibly pathogenic viruses is also possible; this was the way in which SV40 was first discovered in oral poliovirus vaccine in 1960. Inappropriate use of live virus vaccines, for example, in immunocompromised hosts or during pregnancy, may lead to vaccine-associated disease, whereas the same vaccine given to a healthy individual may be perfectly safe.",

In response to this problem, new technologies such as reverse genetics could be used to improve and shorten the lengthy process of preparing vaccines. RNA virus genomes can be easily manipulated as DNA clones to contain nucleotide sequences that match currently circulating strains of the virus. Infectious virus particles are rescued from the DNA clones by introducing these into cells. Seed viruses for distribution to vaccine manufacturers can be produced in as little as 1 to 2 weeks, a much shorter time than the months this process takes in conventional vaccine manufacture. Using the same technology, universal influenza vaccines containing crucial virus antigens expressed as fusion proteins with other antigenic molecules could feasibly be produced, making the requirement for constant production of new influenza vaccines obsolete. Although this has not yet been achieved, advances toward these goals are being made.\n",

Mammals, including humans, encode hundreds of miRNAs. Some viruses with eukaryotic hosts also encode miRNAs. Herpesviruses in particular encode multiple miRNAs; most other nuclear DNA viruses encode one or two miRNAs. RNA viruses and cytoplasmic DNA viruses appear to lack any miRNAs. Virus miRNAs may serve two major functions. Several have been shown to inhibit the expression of cellular factors that play a role in cellular innate or adaptive antiviral immune responses, so reducing the effectiveness of the immune response. Alternatively, virus miRNAs may downregulate the expression of virus proteins, including key immediate-early or early regulatory proteins. In herpes simplex virus, miRNAs are expressed at high levels during latency, but not during productive replication, so their action is thought to stabilize latency.\n",
