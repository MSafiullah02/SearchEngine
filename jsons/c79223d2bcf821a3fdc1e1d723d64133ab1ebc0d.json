            "text": "One of the main and most effective measures to contain the recent viral outbreak is the maintenance of the socalled Social Distancing (SD). To comply with this constraint, workplaces, public institutions, transports and schools will likely adopt restrictions over the minimum inter-personal distance between people. Given this actual scenario, it is crucial to massively measure the compliance to such physical constraint in our life, in order to figure out the reasons of the possible breaks of such distance limitations, and understand if this implies a possible threat given the scene context. All of this, complying with privacy policies and making the measurement acceptable. To this end, we introduce the Visual Social Distancing (VSD) problem, defined as the automatic estimation of the inter-personal distance from an image, and the characterization of the related people aggregations. VSD is pivotal for a non-invasive analysis to whether people comply with the SD restriction, and to provide statistics about the level of safety of specific areas whenever this constraint is violated. We then discuss how VSD relates with previous literature in Social Signal Processing and indicate which existing Computer Vision methods can be used to manage such problem. We conclude with future challenges related to the effectiveness of VSD systems, ethical implications and future application scenarios.",

People that are closer than the imposed distance (red disks), i.e. not respecting geometry, might still respect public rules if having a bond of kinship.

II-C) and try to make sense of what distances mean. In other words, to inform technologies with principles and laws of Proxemics, the psychology area showing how people convey social meaning through interpersonal distances and, ultimately, how social and physical dimensions of space interplay with one another [74] . Proxemics is strictly linked to the definition of people gath-erings, namely groups, and as such, it depends on its spatial organization and the number of people involved. In general, the surrounding space around a person is characterized by interpersonal distance classes [38] , namely: intimate, personal, peri-personal or social, and public spaces (see Fig. 3 ), all associated to different SDs, in turn, also dependent by the degree of kinship and familiarity between the subjects and by the geometrical configuration and size of the environment in which an interplay occurs. A blind application of social distancing rules, encouraging to stay further than 1-2 meters, will eliminate an entire interpersonal distance class and all of the social interactions which take play within it, including for example those between children and relatives. As can be noticed, behavior, social interactions, and space arrangements are tightly coupled, and affect each other. This is why it is important to take into considerations all these aspects when constraints in this respect are to be imposed, in particular when people health is in play.",

The main reason behind the choice of VSD is that computer vision and social signal processing have already developed methods for automatic measurement and understanding of interpersonal distances (see Sec. II for more details). Furthermore, VSD approaches have shown advantages that can complement other technologies like, e.g., mobile applications based on large-scale mobility patterns. In particular, VSD approaches can characterize interpersonal distances in terms of social relations (e.g., whether people at a certain distance are friends, family members or partners), thus allowing one to modulate interventions according to such an information. Furthermore, vision-based technologies can detect contextual information helpful to understand whether social distancing rules are actually being broken or not. For example, VSD can understand whether people get too close because the situation makes it necessary (e.g., when someone rescues a person in troubles) or whether the distance is not a problem (e.g., when people wear personal protective equipment and can safely stay close). Finally, VSD helps to understand the reason why some people stand close, distinguishing whether they are socializing among themselves, or if they are interacting with the environment (as for example looking at a timetable in the airport) thus suggesting the most proper countermeasure to ensure SD (eg. rising an audio alarm to discourage social interactions or putting markers into the floor so that people can watch the time table while keeping the right distances).",

Such a distinction, evident to humans, poses a real and new challenge to a computational algorithm for VSD that could solve the problem by leveraging, for instance, the use of contextual information. Differently, the number of false alarms would be so high that any benefit resulting from the use of technology would be canceled.",

Starting from a geometrical point of view, i.e. estimating inter-personal distances between people from an image, we show that this first step does not take into account the scene and social contextual. For this reason, a further stage needs to elaborate the geometrical VSD in order to interpret if the violation of the distance is a real cause of alert or an acceptable situation (e.g. a family walking together). We then contextualise the VSD in a range of application that can benefit from its application and finally conclude with a description of the possible ethical shortcomings of the application.",

II-A), person detection/body pose estimation (Sec. II-B) and social distance characterization (Sec. II-C). Indeed, the geometry of the scene is a first important to define a local reference system for measuring inter-personal distances. Clearly, a second and important task is the detection of people in the scene in possibly crowded environments. Once the target people are correctly localised in a scene, their distance can be locally estimate in order to understand if the mutual distance is lower than a threshold (e.g. 1m or 2m). Afterwards, this metric information is analysed to output whether there is a violation of the protocol or the short distance is due to a legitimate situation, e.g. a family walking together.",

This problem is strongly related to the single view metrology topic [20] as we consider the most common case of a fixed camera. An initial solution for estimating inter-personal distances requires the identification of the ground plane where people walks [50] , [79] , [40] , [62] , [1] , [102] , [107] . Such ground plane serves in many video-surveillance systems to visualise the scene as a bird's eye view for ease of visualisation and data statistics representation. Most works impose the assumption that the ground plane is planar. Then, the problem is to estimate an homography given some reference elements (e.g., known objects or manual measurements) extracted from the scene or using the information of detected vanishing points in the image [60] , [20] , [77] , [69] , [109] , [5] , [4] , [51] , [113] , [58] . Another common approach is to calibrate fixed cameras by observing the motion of dynamic objects such as pedestrians [53] , [95] , [59] , [91] . Recently, approaches based on deep learning attempts at estimating directly camera pose and intrinsic parameters on a single image [41] , [57] .",

Depth from single image might be a viable option, but a metric reference is still needed. \u2022 Estimating a metric reference for precise SD measures from images is an issue. Such reference extracted from pedestrians might be unreliable given the variations in anthropometric characteristics. Reasoning on the geometrical context of the scene (e.g., object shapes) can lead to a more robust metric estimate. It is also important to emphasizes here that VSD is a simpler problem than estimating every metric distances among people in any position in the image. SD is necessary when two or more pedestrians get close enough for triggering the necessity of a measure. At this point, a local reference system can be estimated and metric references can be leveraged by using surrounding objects and the height of the local cluster of people.",

Specific pedestrian techniques have been designed to work in crowded scenes [97] , [106] , [55] , [29] , where skeleton-based representations are often drop in favour of saliency-based masks, especially focusing on heads. When the image resolution becomes too low to spot single people, regression-based approaches are employed [12] , [15] , [54] , [80] , [104] , [111] , [92] , providing in some case density measures [87] , [110] , [73] , [86] . This information, merged with a geometric model of the scene, will directly lead to a measure of the average SD in the field of view. Obviously, regression or density-based approaches cannot provide additional cues on pose which are highly important for capturing human actions and interactions. To fill this gap, ad-hoc approaches individuate general crowd activities, classifying them as normal or not (e.g. a person collapsing and many people getting close) [25] , [34] , [70] , [72] .",

Yet, finding the location of people in such cases is of relevant importance to alert or creating statistics of overcrowded areas. To this end, a people detection module has to be robust to severe self and other objects/people occlusions, different image scales, and indoor/outdoor scenarios. Although a person detection (i.e., without the pose) may be enough for estimating the VSD, finding joints and body parts of pedestrian has certain advantages. This is due the fact that to obtain an approximate metric reference, or even calibrating cameras, usually the person height is used as a coarse proxy as computed from a bounding box or by more precise techniques [102] , [100] , [8] , [24] , [36] . However, bounding boxes do not account for different body poses (e.g., sitting, riding) that might negatively impact the estimate of height and thus a wrong VSD. Another issue is related to occlusions, i.e. how much is reliable to extract a person height without having a full body information? This is necessary in the likely case of crowded environments or whenever an object partially hides person body parts (e.g., a person seated at a desk).",

Groups have been usually identified exploiting positional and velocity cues (people in a group is close and move with similar oriented velocity) [33] , [76] , [42] , [81] , [88] , [89] , [90] , [78] , [94] . Explicit focus on free-standing conversation groups is given in [21] , [44] , [84] , [82] , [98] , [99] . In most of these latter approaches, positional and velocity cues are enriched by pose information, fully capturing the people proxemics. Coming back to the characterization of SDs, and to Fig. 4 , joint-focused groups where people stand closer than a given threshold requires maximal attention, since their vicinity is by choice, and not by external circumstances. At this level of characterization, avoiding false alarms would mean to focus on the age of the interactants: Having children in a small gathering would probably indicate a family. Approaches like [112] estimate the age from pedestrian detections, but solving this task efficiently seems to be still at its early stages.",

Medium gatherings have never been properly addressed neither by Computer Vision nor Social Signal Processing literature. Finally, we should consider the static/dynamic axis concerning the degree of freedom and flexibility of the spatial, positional, and orientational organisation of gatherings. Distinguishing between uncommon, common-focused and jointly focused is hard, since when a gathering is moving, their members spend attention to follow safe trajectories, avoiding collisions. Therefore, the aforementioned taxonomy holds especially for static formations, with few exceptions [17] . When people are moving, the only valid distinction that Computer Vision and Social Signal Processing do follow is that of small and large gathering.",

In addition, distance plays a major role along one of the five Godspeed dimensions typically used to assess the quality of human-robot interaction, namely perceived safety [3] .",

This happens not only for ethical reasons, but also because McKinsey has shown that companies ensuring diversity in their workforce, especially at the top management levels, are 30% more likely to be above national median in terms of financial returns [43] . As a consequence, major companies like Facebook (https://managingbias.fb.com) and Google (https://diversity.google) adopt implicit training programs. Furthermore, Forbes estimates that the market of implicit bias and diversity training has reached a value close to USD 9 billion-a-year (http://goo.gl/R53xn4). Unconscious bias leaves different traces in nonverbal behaviour and one of these is the increase of physical distances (see, e.g. [65] ). Therefore, automatic technologies for proxemics analysis can help to detect the phenomenon, contributing to protect the potential victims, and train the bias bearers to identify and attenuate their tendencies to discriminate others.",

Similarly, the restructuring of Westminster in the UK aims at improving the efficiency of parliamentary works, but encounters the opposition of Parliament workers afraid of disrupting established traditions by the change of the way space is organised [85] . Until now, the study of these phenomena has been performed mainly through ethnographic observations, but the development of technologies for proxemic analysis can certainly help by producing more objective and quantitative data about the change in habits of the people. This is in line with previous works about the study of organisations through the use of smart badges detecting who is in proximity with whom in an organisation [27] .",

Similarly, surveillance systems can further refine their ability to detect events of interest in a given environment like, e.g., an aggression in a public space. Finally, technologies analysing interpersonal distances can be of help to social psychologists that investigate the dynamics of social interactions. In other words, far from being exhaustive, the list of application domains listed in this section still provides an indication of how wide the application of VSD can be once the Covid 19 outbreak, at the origin of the most recent interest towards interpersonal distances, will be over.",

By adopting a privacy-bydesign principle, a first option is to process video sequences internally, while measuring and transfer only VSD estimates without any image, thus sensible data, being transmitted to the remote control operative room. This is of crucial importance for VSD, since as we have been shown in the previous sections, accurate estimates may requires the identification of kinship.

Tracing technologies, on the contrary, need to be fed with sensible data and even when this is totally anonymized, recent research [22] proves that individuals may still be identified by a few information -four spatio-temporal points allows one to uniquely identify 95% of people in a mobile phone database of 1.5 million subjects and 90% of people in a credit card database of 1 million individuals.",

We pointed out that VSD is not only a Computer Vision problem related to geometrical proxemic since people distancing has to be weighted given the social context in the current scene. Close relationships can allow closer interpersonal distances as well as being a caretaker of individuals with fragile conditions. We have shown that understanding such social context is a compelling problem in the literature of signal social processing that requires further research efforts for a reliable solution. As the solution is intertwined with the decoding of social relationship from images, there are strong ethical and privacy concerns that need to be addressed with novel privacy-by-design solutions. Past this grievous global crisis, VSD has still an important role in several application fields thus providing a continuous source of interest in this new problem.",
