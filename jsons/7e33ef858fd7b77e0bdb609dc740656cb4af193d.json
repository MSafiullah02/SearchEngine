            "text": "Influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and adenovirus (AdV) represent the most common viruses causing acute respiratory diseases resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Conventional culture methods used to isolate respiratory viruses are based on tissue culture methods utilizing a panel of cell lines that include MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney), LLC-MK2 (Rhesus monkey kidney), HEp-2 (laryngeal cancer), A549 (human lung carcinoma), and RD (Rhabdomyosarcoma). Maintenance of different cell lines is complicated, cumbersome, requires long turnaround times, and is expensive. The RhMK (primary rhesus monkey kidney) cell line has been used for isolation of various respiratory viruses. However, the availability of primary cells, varying susceptibility to infection with different respiratory viruses, the potential of harboring endogenous foamy virus, and high costs limit the use of this cell line in diagnostic virology laboratories. Commercial R-Mix (Mix cells with A549 and Mint Lung) and super E-Mix (genetically engineered BGMK and Caco-2 cells) have replaced the conventional cell line panel for the isolation of respiratory viruses [Lee et al., 1992; Buck et al., 2002; Weinberg et al., 2004] . Caco-2 cells have also been used to isolate enteroviruses, enteric viruses, and influenza viruses [Reigel, 1985; Pint\u00f3 et al., 1994; Yoshino et al., 1998; Chiapponi et al., 2010; Jahangir et al., 2010] . Several studies have also showed that Caco-2 cells have the ability to propagate coronaviruses NL63 and SARS from culture isolates [Spiegel and Weber, 2006; M\u00fc ller et al., 2010] . However, the efficacy of Caco-2 cells in isolating common respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples remains unknown. In this study, the efficacy of isolating respiratory viruses from Caco-2 cells was compared to isolation from the conventional cell line panel.",

Caco-2; HEp-2, and A549 cells were fed with 1 ml of MEM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (GibcoBRL) and antibiotics.

The cultures were then examined for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) daily for up to 10 days. At the end of the incubation period, or when CPE was detected, a cell scraper was used to collect cells that were mounted subsequently on Teflon-coated slides, fixed, and immunostained with IMAGEN TM respiratory screen and typing reagents (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) specific for viral antigens.",

Briefly, nasopharyngeal aspirate or infected cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellet washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell pellet was then spotted on 6-mm teflon-coated slide wells, air dried, and fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min. Smears were stained with IMAGEN TM respiratory screen and typing reagents for influenza virus type A and B, RSV, PIV screen and typing, AdV (Oxoid), and PIV-4 (Millipore, Temecula, CA) and viewed at a magnification of 400\u00c2 under epi-fluorescence illumination using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter of a fluorescence microscope (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany).",

CPE was not discernable in virus-infected LLC-MK2 cells except for RSV and PIV-1 that induced CPE between days 3 and 7. Only influenza virus was able to induce CPE in MDCK cells between days 2 and 5.

Of the 42 cultures that were negative using the conventional cell culture panel, 36 were positive when cultured with Caco-2 cells. Conversely, 30 Caco-2 cultures were negative and 24 were conventional panel positive (Table II) . There were 6 PIV-3 direct immunofluorescence antigen test positive specimens with negative viral cultures that were confirmed positive by RT-PCR. Caco-2 cells were the most efficient cell line for isolating PIV-2-4, and HEp2, MDCK, LLC-MK2, and A549 were the most efficient cell lines for recovering RSV, influenza A and B, PIV-1, and adenovirus, respectively (Table I) . One of the major advantages of using Caco-2 cells was that viruses were recovered from this cell line that could not be cultured using cell lines comprising the conventional cell panel (Table II) . However, Caco-2 cells required a 2-5 day-longer incubation time for virus recovery compared to the other cell lines. The sensitivity was increased from 84% to 87-89% if Caco-2 were used with any one of the cell lines comprising the conventional panel (Table III) . In order to maximize the sensitivity and decrease costs, combining Caco-2 and MDCK cells can be used during influenza seasons to isolate the maximum number of influenza viruses. Combinations of Caco-2 with LLC-MK2 or A549 cells can be used to culture other viruses at other times of the year.",
