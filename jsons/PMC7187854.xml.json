At the beginning of the epidemic, there was insufficient understanding of the significance of anal swab nucleic acid detection. A 10-year-old boy had a history of close contact with the diagnosed patient, but he had no symptoms, and his blood routine and chest CT examination were normal. Nucleic acid samples from respiratory tract specimens were negative many times, but stool samples were positive for nucleic acids after 17 days and then turned negative after 9 days.14 There are also reports of children who were discharged from the hospital twice after a negative nucleic acid test and then returned to the hospital because of digestive tract symptoms and positive fecal nucleic acid.15 The author detected 73 cases of adult SARS-CoV-2-infected fecal virus RNA, and the positive rate accounted for 53.4%. After the respiratory viral nucleic acid was negative, 23.3% of the stools were still positive. Viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissue biopsy specimens of infected cases. Immunofluorescence staining of the ACE2 receptor and viral nucleocapsid protein in gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium were positive, which provided evidence for gastrointestinal infection.13 Nucleic acid positivity in anal swabs mostly occurs after positive respiratory tract specimens, and the negative time is longer than that in respiratory tract specimens, indicating that the digestive tract clears viruses slower than the respiratory tract.12 Is the novel coronavirus shed from the respiratory tract and swallowed into the digestive tract? It is unclear whether the respiratory and digestive tracts are also infected. The long-term discharge of SARS-CoV-2 in feces may pollute the environment and endanger public health.16 Is there a risk of fecal-oral transmission? Should the isolation (or discharge) of the patient be terminated before the viral nucleic acid in the feces becomes negative? It is worth exploring.",
