Resilience is needed as systems and organizations become more complex and interrelated and the consequences of accidents and incidents increase. This paper analyzes the notion of resilience based on a literature survey and an exploration of incidents. In particular, resilience involves the ability of systems to undergo graceful and controlled degradation, the ability to rebound from degradation, the presence of redundancy, the ability to manage margins close to the performance boundaries, the establishment and exploration of common mental models, the presence of flexibility in systems and organizations, and the reduction of complexity and coupling. The paper describes how resilience can be included in system development and operations by considering organizations, technology and human factors. Also, it shows how past strengths and weaknesses can be considered in risk analysis to enhance safety, security and resilience.",

Safety is the \"freedom from accidents or losses\" while security is \"the degree of protection against danger, loss and criminals\" [10] . Resilience is \"the ability of a system or organization to react to and recover from disturbances at an early stage, with minimal effect on the dynamic stability\" [5] . Accidents and incidents are often due to a combination of vulnerabilities. The ability to foresee or rebound from accidents and incidents enhances both safety and security. Resilience involves the avoidance and reduction of the consequences of disturbances from a safety and security perspective.",

We attempt to identify principles that would enable accidents to be foreseen and avoided, as well as to increase resilience in general, such as the ability to recover from an adverse situation or reduce the consequences. The notion of a safety culture can help explain accidents and avoid accidents. Indeed, the notion of a safety culture clarifies the differences between carriers in the airline industry [14] -the probability of occurrence of an airline accident varies by a factor of 42 across air carriers, regardless of the standardization of technology, organization and human competence in the airline industry [14] . Many alternative definitions of safety culture exist and there is disagreement about how the culture can be changed or improved; however, in this paper, we focus on the ability to improve safety using safety culture as an element of a change process. Finally, HRO has important positive properties [9, 15] , which we explore in order to identify key resilience principles.",

The complementary principle is the ability of a degraded system to rebound or recover and return to normal conditions.

Thus, different approaches may engage different interpretations of resilience and identify different resilience principles. Clearly, there is no consensus on the list of resilience principles. It is, therefore, important that the principles be considered as a set, not as individual standalone concepts. Two of the principles mentioned in this paper are also described by Rasmussen [13] : the ability to manage margins close to the performance boundaries, and the ability to achieve graceful and controlled degradation and rebound from adverse situations. These principles embody key issues related to resilience and their presence in the literature provides a degree of validation for our approach.",

The resilience perspective improves the quality of a risk analysis. This is based on three arguments. First, the scope of past incidents explored in the risk analysis is increased; the understanding of how to avoid accidents and enhance recovery improves resilience and reduces the risk of future accidents. Second, considering current challenges in the analysis of future risk helps make the unexpected expected, leading to increased focus on graceful degradation and recovery. Note, however, that the ability to rebound and other resilience properties may increase system complexity, which can lead to accidents. Consequently, to avoid increased risk, resilience should be considered during risk analysis just like other mitigating actions. Third, there is increased focus on the management of margins and boundary conditions through the use of proactive indicators; this enhances the understanding of the key processes that influence safety.",
