The treatment of pyogenic liver abscess is by drainage of the pus and initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment. An indwelling catheter may be placed in the abscess cavity when the abscess is larger than 5 cm in size. Intermittent needle aspiration may be attempted.

The major species differ in their life cycle as well as presence or absence of a hepatic phase. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium malariae are not associated with a hepatic cycle, while Plasmodium vivax and ovale do have a persistent exoerythrocytic phase in the liver. The extent of hepatic injury relates to the species and the severity of infection. Active hemolysis leads to an increase in the unconjugated fraction of bilirubin. However, once hepatocellular dysfunction sets in, the conjugated fraction of bilirubin begins to rise as well. Liver failure leads to liver synthetic function impairment and a decrease in serum albumin and prolonged prothrombin time. Hyperglycemia and lactic acidosis are late complications. There is a high mortality with disease. Congenital malaria, although rare, may also lead to severe and even fulminant liver disease in the newborn infant. The diagnosis of malaria requires history, physical examination, and the identification of the parasite on blood smear. Rapid antigen detection assays are now available. Treatment depends on the species of Plasmodium. Chloroquine may be effective, but in many parts for the world chloroquine resistance is increasingly seen, and in these areas treatment requires mefloquine and quinine. Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine and proguanil are also used for treatment [38, 39].",

Predictors of IFN responsiveness include active hepatitis, low HBV DNA levels (<1,000 pg/mL), high serum alanine aminotransferase ALT(>2\u00d7 ULN), short duration of disease, non-Asian ethnic origin, and horizontal transmission. On the basis of European experience, consensus recommendations for the use of IFN-alpha for HBV infected children were developed. The main goals of therapy, according to these recommendations, were to accelerate HBeAg clearance in children with HBeAg and HBV DNA positivity, with low-intermediate HBV DNA levels and abnormal aminotransferase enzymes, ages 2 years or older. IFN therapy is less likely to be of benefit in children with perinatally acquired infection who have normal or minimally elevated aminotransferases. The recommended treatment regimen for IFN-alpha is five to ten million units per square meter thrice weekly by subcutaneous injection for 4 to 6 months. The response rates are variable, depending on route of acquisition, ethnic origin, disease activity, and treatment regime. Adult data suggest that HBeAg-negative chronic disease should be treated for 12 months, whereas others demonstrate that longer durations of treatment of 24 months increased sustained response rates [105]. Pretreatment with corticosteroids (\u201cpriming\u201d) and their withdrawal before commencing IFN-alpha may exacerbate the host immune response, facilitating seroconversion. The benefit, however, remains unproven and is associated with the risk of precipitating fulminant liver failure. IFN\u03b1 is thought to simply accelerate seroconversion, as many patients who do not respond to treatment may still seroconvert to anti-HBe later in life [106]. In a series, 74 children were followed for 7 years. In treated patients with elevated baseline ALT levels HBsAg clearance was observed in 4\u201315 % of children treated with IFN (15\u201325 % of responders), compared to 0\u201310 % of controls [106].",

Hepatic disease is characterized by an increase in liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase with or without organomegaly. The clinical course is usually mild; however, occasionally there may be hepatic necrosis. In congenital infections with CMV, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenic purpura, and severe neurological impairment have been described [167]. Portal vein thrombosis may occur [168]. Disseminated disease can occur in the immunocompromised host and may manifest as hepatitis, pancreatitis, and rarely gangrenous cholecystitis. CMV has been described in AIDS-associated cholangiopathy and primary sclerosing cholangitis [169, 170]. CMV hepatitis may be difficult to distinguish from graft rejection in liver transplant patients, but the differentiation is crucial to appropriate management. Diagnosis requires serological analysis and liver biopsy. IgM antibodies demonstrate acute infection and PCR is used for confirmation particularly in immunocompromised patients. Multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear portal infiltrate are seen on liver biopsy. There are characteristics intranuclear inclusions that are called \u201cowl\u2019s eye\u201d inclusions.
