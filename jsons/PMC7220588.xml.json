Bhattacharya noted that \u201cGiven the number of surgeries done in India, it is mandatory for the surgical team to be adequately protected from virus transmission during the COVID\u221219 outbreak [1].\u201d In fact, surgeon has a high risk for getting COVID-9 during occupational practice. The COVID-19 patient might be asymptomatic and might transmit disease to the surgeon [2]. Several recommendations by Bhattacharya are useful. The implementation of the preventive actions is a challenge. Reallocation of staffs and facilities to correspond to the crisis is needed. Here, we would like to share ideas from Inchina where disease outbreak is also serious. Due to the long period of outbreak, some surgeons already got infection. The lack of protective device is the main problem. Also, some practitioners might follow only local guideline for screening for COVID-19. According to local criteria, fever is the main determinant; hence, the under diagnosis of asymptomatic case is possible and results in infection among medical personnel. The infection control process should be universal and applied for all cases in all settings.",
