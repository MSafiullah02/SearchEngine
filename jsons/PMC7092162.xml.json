Other single causes for ESRD are Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome, diabetes mellitus type I and one kidney failure was considered secondary to conditioning radiation therapy. All patients undergoing KTX after HCT were dialysis dependent. One patient had kidney failure for unknown reason, two required second KTX for rejection. Twenty-two out of 53 kidney recipients received the kidney from their HCT donor. The absence of third party alloreactivity may potentially enable weaning off immunosuppression. This was achieved in a total of six cases (27%). One additional case was reported to be only on corticosteroid maintenance. On the other hand, subjecting a recipient with a second encounter of identical donor lymphocytes might potentially increase the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) which is reported in one out of 22 cases (5%), and passenger lymphocyte syndrome, which was not observed.",

Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue caused death at 2.2 years following kidney transplantation in one patient 7.4 years out of non-Hodgkin lymphoma at an age of 43 years. Two cardiac mortalities were reported nine years post kidney transplantation.

However, liver transplantation is consistently reported feasible in selected end-stage liver disease HCT survivors.

Other non-infectious complications include interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis and organising pneumonia. The pathogenesis of BO following allogeneic HCT remains poorly understood clinically diagnosed via pulmonary function and radiologic testing in absence of respiratory tract infection [16, 20]. Bone Marrow Transplant Registry data suggest peripheral blood stem cell source, long duration to transplant, female donor to male recipient, history of interstitial pneumonitis in addition to acute GVHD, and busulfan-based conditioning regimen as risk factors [1, 16]. There is no standard treatment for BO. In general, management consists of immunosuppression (high dose corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors). Response rates are limited to improvement of lung function tests in about 20% of patients [21, 22]. Results of salvage immunosuppressive therapies like calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or sirolimus are disappointing, and no randomised clinical trials have investigated their efficacy. Patients not responding to conventional treatment reveal 2-year and 5-year survival rates of 20 and 13%, respectively [15]. Recently, other approaches such as imatinib mesylate, antithymocyte globulins, anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) have been tried with variable successes [15\u201318]. ECP has shown to be beneficial in patients with lung involvement by chronic GVHD. Other immunosuppressive strategies, like administration of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha blockers, rituximab or imatinib, have been used in small patient numbers and to be considered experimental. In severe therapy-refractory BO, LuTX can be a therapeutic option. In general, the donor of LuTX is different from hematopoietic stem cell donor. Therefore, there is high risk of rejection and relapse of BO. Recently, there was one report of a living-donor lobar LuTX from the same donor of bone marrow [23].",
