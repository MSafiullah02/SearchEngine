The infection can either be asymptomatic or show symptoms such as cough, fever etc. along with difficulty in breathing [2]. The disease has been brought under control in all Middle Eastern countries except Saudi Arabia where each month, new cases are still reported. Studies have confirmed that this disease is zoonotic and camels are its significant reservoir [3, 4]. People in close contact with infected camels and health care professionals who care for infected patients have a high risk of acquiring the infection. Many cases of community and household acquired infections have been reported from Saudi Arabia [5]. The Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia has issued guidelines for infection prevention, control and management.",

Figure 8 shows that most MERS patients are male and that people below 25 years are less likely to get infected by MERS. Elderly patients are more prone to die of MERS. The majority of patients were not in contact with camels and death rate was low in the case of patients in contact with camels. Many patients acquired the infection from healthcare facilities and high death rate is reported among this group.\n\n",

The use of maps to represent the information will give an idea regarding the spatial distribution of MERS cases. These maps will help the health authorities to identify the areas with large number of cases and hence alert the hospitals and the general public regarding that. The interactive nature of the table helps the users in analyzing the data as per their requirement. A salient feature of the application is that the users can easily download details corresponding to the period of their choice. Analyzing the data based on camel contact will aid health authorities to identify the areas where many such cases are present and hence intensify the awareness programs to reduce the rate of infection.",

The attributes used include the date of reporting, city, region, age, gender, description of the disease, camel contact and status of the patient. The user can view details regarding all cases, recovered cases, death cases or hospitalized cases for all the cities, all regions or cities within a region. Our tool provides the flexibility to view information in the form of charts and maps, or downloadable tables. The analysis is also carried out based on age group, camel contact and month-wise cases. By viewing the maps, users can easily differentiate between places based on the number of cases. Moreover, the users can view a visual summary of the number of cases for different values of attributes based on the status of the patients. Understanding and analyzing the disease related information can help decision makers in setting guidelines for preventing and controlling the spread of disease. Location-based analysis of the infection is highly essential in formulating region specific awareness programs to reduce the rate of infection.",
