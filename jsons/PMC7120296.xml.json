            "text": "Our knowledge of the molecular structure and function of viruses has grown spectacularly in the last decades, largely because these entities have uniquely and increasingly attracted the interest of biologists, (bio)chemists and physicists alike. Viruses have, thus, been rediscovered as organized complexes of biomolecules that act as minute machines. These nanomachines are continuously being modified and diversified through mutation and biological adaptation. However, they are invariably determined by the laws of physics and chemistry to blindly perform sophisticated mechanochemical actions, including penetration into host cells and self-assembly from their molecular components after these have been replicated in the cell. The application of physical and physicochemical techniques has led to the determination of the high-resolution molecular structures of many viruses; the interplay of this approach with (bio)chemical and biological approaches have allowed in many cases the elucidation of the structural basis of viral function in unprecedented detail. Structural Virology has permeated other virological disciplines to provide a molecular view of viruses and their biology. The detailed structural knowledge on viruses and their components has made, and will surely continue to make, decisive contributions in the fight against viral disease.",

            "text": "In the last years, the advent of nanoscience and nanotechnology, and the increasing awareness on the outstanding features of virus particles as solid-state nanodevices are leading to a renewed look at viruses from the physicist\u2019s point of view. Theoretical physicists have begun to tackle at the most fundamental level different aspects of the architecture, self-assembly and physical properties of virus particles. Also, the development of atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical tweezers and other techniques to study individual molecules have opened up new possibilities for the experimental study of the structure, properties and mechanochemical actions of viruses and their components. A new term, Physical Virology, has recently been coined to encompass theoretical and experimental physics-oriented studies of viruses. This novel approach is slowly beginning to merge with long-standing structural virology approaches based on other physical or physico-chemical techniques such as electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and many others. As a consequence, viruses are currently being investigated for new developments not only in biomedicine and biotechnology but also in nanotechnology, including nanomaterials and nanoelectronics.",

However, physical and biological restrictions limit the length of helical capsids, which are much less frequent than icosahedral capsids; regular helical capsids are found in about 10 % of virus families. 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2 provides a description of the architecture of helical capsids; examples of helical viruses can be found in other chapters of this book.",

This fact could severely limit the size of the nucleic acid genome and, hence, the amount of genetic information that could be enclosed (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2). However, evolution has led to different structural solutions to make very large viral capsids with icosahedral symmetry, made of hundreds of chemically identical CP subunits, that can enclose very large genomes (Fig. 1.2 bottom right). Many large capsids containing many subunits are made of only one type of CP that is capable to adopt different quasi-equivalent (similar) conformations (given by the triangulation number T); this feature allows the CP molecule to fit into T non-equivalent positions in the icosahedral capsid (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2 for a detailed description). This evolutionary strategy minimizes the amount of genetic information required to encode the capsid. Icosahedral capsids are extremely frequent; they occur in about half the virus families. See 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2 for an in-depth description of the architectures of icosahedral viral capsids; 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11 and others in this book provide many examples of icosahedral capsids and viruses.

In influenza virus (Fig. 1.1, right), several roughly helical nucleocapsid complexes (ribonucleoprotein particles) are directly surrounded by a protein layer (the matrix) and the lipid envelope, and this virus is clearly pleomorphic. Many other variations in virion architecture, some of them very complex, do exist. In some cases, two concentric capsids are found; in others, internal lipidic envelopes are present.

Some animal viruses are among the structurally simplest viruses known. These include the parvoviruses (e.g., the minute virus of mice, MVM (Fig. 1.1, left) or the adeno-associated viruses, AAV; see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10).

The study of the structure, function, biology and pathogenicity of many animal viruses has been or is still hampered by a number of difficulties, including their structural and/or functional complexity, technical problems to grow and/or manipulate them and/or safety issues. However, despite all the difficulties, and mainly because of the biomedical or socioeconomic importance of a large number of animal viruses that are pathogenic for humans or livestock, many of these are among the most intensively studied viruses of all. This is reflected also in the many human and animal viruses used as examples and case studies in most chapters of this book. Many particular aspects related to the molecular biology and structure of many different animal viruses can be found also in the books listed at the end of this chapter [1\u20136, 9\u201316].",

Since the origins of Molecular Biology over half a century ago, and continuing through several decades, some bacteriophages were found to present important advantages as model systems for molecular and genetic studies compared to most animal and/or plant viruses. Their advantages include the facility to grow phages and their bacterial hosts in large amounts; the relative structural and functional simplicity and ease of handling of bacterial cells compared to eukaryotic cells; and the possibility to readily obtain certain types of mutant viruses to investigate virus structure and function. These and other reasons led to the intensive use of phages as paradigms for many molecular biology studies on nucleic acid replication, gene expression and their regulation. Several bacteriophages have also provided and continue to provide model systems for studying molecular recognition and self-assembly during the morphogenesis of biomolecular complexes. As a consequence, the structure and function of some bacteriophages, and most stages in their life cycles, are known in great detail (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17).

It must be noted here that genetic recombination and horizontal gene transfer between even very different, unrelated viruses are frequent. Thus, viruses of widely different origins could share some evolutionarily closely related genes, and of course the proteins these genes encode. It is not yet possible to solidly establish a general phylogenetic-based classification of viruses.

The sample is vitrified and kept at extremely low temperature; the virus particles remain hydrated, and no staining is generally required. The possibility of artifacts is greatly reduced compared to conventional EM. Even more important, cryo-EM is invariably used together with three-dimensional reconstruction techniques that average the images of thousands of virus particles visualized in different orientations, and result in a volumetric (three-dimensional) structural model of the imaged particles. Because the images of so many individual particles are averaged, different artifacts affecting different individual particles make very little contribution to the averaged model, and the signal-to-noise ratio is greatly increased. Also, as no staining agent needs to be used, the structural model obtained reveals also the anatomy (internal structure) of the viral particle. The typical resolution achieved on virus particles was, until relatively recently, about 1 nm or less, but in the last years cryo-EM models of some virus particles with a resolution around 0.5 nm, or even higher, have been obtained, thus approaching atomic resolution. In these high-resolution models, the tracing of the polypeptide chains in the viral capsids and other fine structural details, including the orientation of some amino acid side chains, can be observed (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_3).

At present, molecules for structural determination by NMR must be no larger than about 35 kDa. However, by using state-of-the-art instrumentation and sophisticated technical approaches the structures of some larger proteins (50 kDa and more) have been solved. Unfortunately, direct structural determination of complete viral particles, most viral subassemblies and many multidomain or oligomeric proteins are still way beyond the reach of solution NMR spectroscopy.

Its greatest advantage as a static virus imaging technique is that the structure of single particles can be determined in liquid, in close to physiological conditions. Most importantly, AFM can also be used as a dynamic imaging technique, where structural changes can be followed in real time (see below). A clear disadvantage is that, like conventional EM but unlike cryo-EM, cryo-ET, X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, only the surface topography of the object (not its internal structure), can be determined. Because of basic geometric considerations regarding the tip-sample interaction, care has to be exercised in interpreting the images obtained (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_8).

In contrast, some infections involve the constant production of virus particles in small numbers, without killing the infected cells which are able to divide, and both the infected cells and the virus will persist in time (persistent infection). Other infections lead to the indefinite perpetuation in the host cell of the viral genome, which is replicated along with the cellular genome, and propagated by passing to the progeny cells (latent infections). In these infections, the viral genome may be propagated by becoming physically integrated in the cellular genome, as in the case of HIV-1, or by being maintained as an independent (episomal) nucleic acid molecule, as in the case of HSV-1. However, even latent infections can eventually lead to the production and release of virus particles that will be able to infect other host cells, closing the virus life cycle.

It must be emphasized again that many variations are possible depending on the virus species, host cell and environmental conditions. However, this simplified virus cycle may be useful in this book for putting into perspective the different processes in which virus particles and their molecular components participate during the infection process. The cyclic existence of a virus physical entity and its descent is traditionally contemplated in textbooks from the perspective of an infected host cell. Thus, a viral cycle is generally described by starting from a pre-existing, already formed virus particle which infects a cell; and ending with the progeny virus particles that are eventually produced in, and released from the infected cell (either directly in a lytic infection, or after a number of cellular generations have gone through a latent infection). From this classic perspective, the major generic steps in the life cycle of a virus (especially adapted for animal viruses, but mostly valid also for bacteriophages) can be listed in the following order, from step (1) to step (12) (see Fig. 1.4, where steps are identified using the same numbering):\n",

Thus, we have chosen the \u201cbeginning\u201d of the (in fact) endless virus cycle (Fig. 1.4) from the perspective of a virus particle, and not of an infected cell. We start our description after the viral components are synthesized in a host cell and when the viral particle begins its existence by self-assembly from some of those components (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_12, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13 and 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_14); and we proceed until the same viral particle ceases to exist by uncoating its nucleic acid genome in another host cell (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_15, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17). A logical advantage of this approach is that during morphogenesis of a virion critical features are created that will be needed later by that same virion, for example when it enters the cell or when its genome is uncoated. Examples of such features include metastability of many viruses or their components (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_12, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_15 and 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16), or built-in pressure in tailed bacteriophages (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_9, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_12, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_19).",

The structural complexity of these large oligomers (or multimers) usually requires intricate assembly pathways mediated by allosteric switches, irreversible steps, and the assistance of other molecules including scaffolding proteins or the viral nucleic acid. Three different general strategies for capsid assembly can be recognized (Fig. 1.5): (i) Capsid self-assembly, which strictly requires only CP subunits that self-associate under appropriate conditions (Fig. 1.5a); in some cases, some factors may be required to provide the right conditions for self-assembly. (ii) Scaffolding protein-assisted capsid assembly, which invariably requires not only the CP subunits, but also the assistance of scaffolding proteins to produce a precursor, immature capsid (procapsid) (Fig. 1.5b); (iii) Viral nucleic acid-assisted capsid assembly, which requires the simultaneous interaction of the CP subunits and the viral nucleic acid in a condensation process in which capsid assembly and nucleic acid packaging occur simultaneously (Fig. 1.5c). In this book, and from a morphogenetic perspective only, we have arbitrarily considered as simple viruses those that do not require scaffolding proteins for capsid assembly (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10); and as complex viruses those that do require scaffolding proteins and, thus, will follow a more complex capsid assembly pathway (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11).\n",

Unfortunately, the assembly pathways from CBBs to simple icosahedral capsids have proved to be very difficult to trace experimentally, as populated (stable) intermediates (not counting the initial CBBs) are rarely observed, and transient intermediates can be difficult to detect. Despite these difficulties, scarcely populated, transient assembly intermediates have been identified and characterized during assembly or disassembly of simple capsids, for example using electrospray ionization-MS or ion-mobility-MS. In addition, several stable intermediates have been identified during assembly of a few simple viruses, for example in picornaviruses (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10). In contrast, self-assembly and subsequent maturation of more complex icosahedral capsids frequently involve a number of intermediates, including fairly stable intermediates populated at equilibrium and/or transient intermediates, some of which have been identified using different structural or dynamic techniques (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13).",

In turn, results obtained in these experiments have been used as constraints to develop improved or novel theoretical models.

Those analyses have also revealed other rather general features: (i) Self-assembly may be thermodynamically considered as two-state: only the dissociated state (soluble CBBs) is populated below a certain CP concentration, and only the fully associated state (complete capsids) is populated above that concentration. (ii) Capsid assembly kinetics can be represented by a sigmoidal curve and includes a lag phase. (iii) The reaction rate is strongly dependent on protein concentration, and this and the previous features suggest that capsid assembly proceeds through nucleation and growth.

Scaffolding proteins establish specific but transient protein-protein interactions with the CP subunits (CBBs) during the assembly process and are later removed, being absent in the mature virus particle. Thus, scaffolding proteins can be regarded as assembly chaperones. Most, but not all, capsids that require scaffolding proteins for proper assembly have a complex quaternary structure. In some cases the scaffold may self-assemble in the absence of CPs, and is subsequently used as a template for capsid assembly by recruiting CP subunits. In many cases the internal scaffold and the capsid are formed in a co-assembly process where the scaffolding protein subunits promote CP-CP interactions, and the CP subunits promote in turn interactions between the scaffolding protein subunits by eliciting conformational changes in them. Once a precursor, or immature capsid (procapsid) is assembled, the scaffolding proteins are removed, either before or during packaging of the viral nucleic acid.

Maturation refers to a generally irreversible reaction, or series of reactions, that convert a non-infectious (immature) virus particle into an infectious (mature) virion (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13). Maturation reactions may occur before, during and/or after nucleic acid encapsidation. In addition to activation of the virion, a frequent (albeit not universal) effect of maturation is the physical stabilization of the capsid. Proper assembly of many viral capsids may require weak association energies (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_19), and the resulting capsids may be thermodynamically unstable. The observed hysteresis to dissociation may be enough, in some cases, to prevent capsid disassembly by extreme dilution during the extracellular phase. However, irreversible post-assembly reactions may have evolved as an additional, or alternative, mechanism to stabilize many virions. Irreversible maturation frequently blocks the capsid in a rather stable (actually metastable, or \u201cspring loaded\u201d) state through covalent modification and/or conformational rearrangements, which sometimes involve also the formation of stabilizing covalent bonds and/or binding of additional, \u201ccementing\u201d capsid proteins. Maturation of some other virus particles, for example in retroviruses, may actually destabilize them (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_18). In considering maturation or any other stage of the viral cycle, it should be taken into account the different selective constraints that may be acting of different viruses depending on their structure and \u201clifestyle\u201d (e.g., genome protection in enveloped vs. non-enveloped viruses, entry of animal viruses vs. nucleic acid injection in bacteriophages, etc.).",

In several families of small, nonenveloped ssRNA viruses, maturation involves a proteolytic cleavage of some capsid subunits. This reaction frequently results in the release of a peptide required for interaction of the virion with cellular membranes during the infection process. In tailed dsDNA phages, maturation overlaps with DNA packaging and is a complex irreversible process that involves capsid conformational changes and achieves different functional goals: removal of the no longer needed scaffolding proteins, capsid expansion, creation of new binding sites for the attachment of additional structural proteins and subassemblies required for virion function, and capsid stabilization. As for simpler icosahedral capsids, the association energy between CPs in tailed phage capsids is low and the procapsid (prohead) is rather unstable. The viral dsDNA is packaged into the capsid to a very high (crystalline) density, which results in the capsid becoming pressurized. Capsid pressurization is thought to be required for assisting injection of the viral genome into the infected host bacterium, but will tend to disrupt the unstable procapsid (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_9, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_18, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_19). Thus, different dsDNA phages have evolved different specific strategies for capsid stabilization during and after maturation. See 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13 for a detailed description of these and other maturation strategies and mechanisms in different viruses. Examples of maturation in some other viruses can be found also in a few other chapters in this book (e.g., 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10).

As a result, virion morphogenesis in the host cell generally requires auxiliary viral or cellular factors, including chaperones, and occur in virus factories, very complex cellular structures that are formed inside infected cells.

Nearly every study on the molecular determinants of viral capsid stability so far has focused on analysis of the resistance of the virion against inactivation of its infectivity (as an indication of structural alterations), or of the viral particle against chemical modification (including proteolytic cleavage), conformational rearrangement or dissociation into subunits by the action of heat or (bio)chemical agents. However, viruses may be also subjected to severe mechanical stress both outside and inside cells, and must be robust enough to withstand the mechanical forces acting on them. Moreover, viruses may have evolved not only to withstand, but also to use those mechanical forces. Very recently, the mechanical stability of virus particles and other aspects of virus mechanics, and their possible biological consequences, have begun to be investigated using AFM (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_18) and physics-based theoretical approaches (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_19).",

Biochemical and biophysical studies of non-enveloped virions and capsids in solution reveal that that they are not static at equilibrium, but constitute dynamic assemblies which sample a range of similar conformations around a minimum free energy state. This so-called breathing tends to transiently increase exposure to solvent of some structural elements in the particle, including functional CP peptide segments, and these events may be biologically required during some steps of the viral cycle. Capsid breathing can be modulated by internal components or capsid-bound external molecules. In the PV and HRV virions a large hydrophobic cavity (pocket) is involved both in breathing, and in facilitating a transition of the particle from a metastable conformation to another conformation during cell receptor recognition and nucleic acid uncoating. Binding of antiviral agents to the hydrophobic pocket (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_20), or of a virus-neutralising antibody to a region nearby, or mutations in the capsid that may partly fill the pocket were shown to impair viral breathing. The same factors also impair the transition between the metastable and final states of the capsid. The above and other results indicate that global or local conformational dynamics (breathing) may be a general feature in virus particles, and may be required for infection by facilitating structural transitions. Very recent AFM studies have revealed that different regions in viral particles can differ in mechanical stiffness, and indicate that local regions in the particle with high mechanical flexibility may also present high conformational dynamism which may be biologically relevant (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_18).",

In addition to conformational dynamism at equilibrium, metastable virions respond to the appropriate stimuli by undergoing controlled conformational transitions required for infectivity. In non-enveloped viruses, the entire viral particle may be conformationally rearranged, although the greatest alterations may sometimes be localized (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_15). In enveloped viruses, a particular structural component (e.g., an envelope glycoprotein on the surface) may change its conformation (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16). The transitions must be controlled through the action of regulatory factors, to ensure they occur at the appropriate location and time. The same conformational rearrangements caused by physiological factors can be frequently induced in vitro, even under non-physiological conditions using different agents (e.g., changes in temperature or pH). These facts have facilitated the ex vivo or in vitro studies of capsid conformational rearrangements using a vast array of techniques. In some cases, the biological relevance of the transitions observed is not yet clear. In other cases, the identified capsid rearrangements have been shown to be biologically required. These structural changes may be required, for example, for exit of the virion from the cell compartment or the cell where it was formed, entry into another cell, intracellular transport, or uncoating of the viral genome.

Once bound to a capsid (non-enveloped viruses) or envelope protein (enveloped viruses), antibodies can neutralize virions by one of several different mechanisms. A frequent mechanism is interference with cell receptor or co-receptor recognition.

Other mechanisms involve impairment of a conformational rearrangement of a protein or of the virion that would be required at some stage of the viral cycle.

Some antibodies may exert a neutralizing effect by binding bivalently to the capsid, increasing capsid stability and probably impairing uncoating; they may even act intracellularly after the virus-receptor antibody has been internalized. Other antibodies may exert their neutralizing effect by facilitating virus elimination through opsonization.

In this loop, a RGD motif and some neighboring residues are critically involved in binding both the cell receptor and different virus-neutralizing antibodies. FMDV cannot escape from neutralization by any of these antibodies through mutation of nearly any one of the residues critically involved in antibody binding, because these are precisely the ones critically involved also in cell receptor binding. However, the virus manages to readily and repeatedly escape neutralization by adopting either of two non-exclusive alternatives: (i) a drastic one (a lesser kind of antigenic \u201cshift\u201d, albeit not due to reassortment, affecting a major antigenic site), by mutation of one of a pair of unique residues that are critical for binding most antibodies that recognise this loop, but less so for binding the receptor; and (ii) a gradual one (a kind of antigenic \u201cdrift\u201d in that same antigenic site) by accumulation of mutations of several residues that, individually, are of minor relevance for antibody binding but that, together, severely impair binding of most antibodies that recognise this viral loop. Studies with many FMDV type C field variants isolated during several decades in two continents indicate that antigenic \u201cshifts\u201d in the major antigenic loop involving mutation of those unique residues have occurred repeatedly and independently, but infrequently; this paucity may be related to a significant loss of fitness caused by these \u201cbalancing act\u201d mutations.

Thorough mutational studies with FMDV and other small viruses indicate that most residues in the capsid surface are involved in virus function: if mutated, they severely impair infection, or at least decrease the biological fitness of the virus. Unlike cellular proteins, the protein capsids of small, nonenveloped viruses may have been functionally streamlined through multiple, sometimes conflicting selective pressures imposed on a very simple structure (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_10, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_12, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_14, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_15, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_18 and 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_19).

            "text": "The mechanism of penetration of enveloped viruses is, in general, better known. Binding of a viral glycoprotein to a cell receptor invariably triggers a conformational change in a viral fusion protein that leads to the physical joining (fusion) of the viral envelope and a cellular membrane (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16). In direct entry (as in HIV-1), after receptor recognition the virus envelope and the plasma membrane are fused. In endosome-mediated entry, after the virus is engulfed in the endosome, acidification leads to the fusion between the virus envelope and the endosome membrane. In both cases, the fusion event allows the diffusion of the viral capsid or nucleocapsid containing the viral genome inside the cell. This is followed by trafficking of the relevant viral component to the appropriate cellular compartment for genome expression and replication.",

            "text": "\nGenome uncoating. Uncoating is, in general, a very poorly known step in the life cycles of animal viruses. In some non-enveloped virions, such as the picornaviruses PV and HRV, receptor binding and or low pH mediate capsid conformational rearrangements that may open pores or fractures large enough for nucleic acid extrusion. In other non-enveloped virions such as the picornavirus FMDV, acidification at the endosomes dissociates the viral capsid into subunits, and the nucleic acid is released into the cytoplasm. Many details of these processes are still uncertain or unknown (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_15). In enveloped virions, the viral nucleic acid-containing capsid or nucleocapsid that entered the cell after fusion of the virus and cell membranes is transported to the appropriate cell compartment for viral nucleic acid uncoating. In some cases, the capsid is disassembled and the nucleic acid just released, either by dilution or by a poorly characterized mechanism that may require the participation of cellular factors (e.g., in HIV-1). In other cases, direct replication and expression of the genome may occur with the viral nucleic acid being still a part of a ribonucleoprotein particle (e.g., in influenza virus) or being still associated with a viral capsid core (e.g., in reoviruses). See 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_15 and 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16 for a detailed description of different mechanisms of cell recognition, entry and uncoating in different non-enveloped or enveloped animal viruses.",

Once a cell is infected, progeny virions may propagate from cell to cell in the organism through discontinuities in the cell wall crossed by channels that establish interconnections between neighboring cells (e.g., plasmodesmata).

AFM can be used to image viruses and follow structural changes in viral particles in real-time (with the temporal limitations imposed by the time required to acquire each image). In addition, AFM can be used to probe some physical properties of virus particles. In particular, their mechanical characteristics such as particle stiffness, Young\u2019s modulus of the capsid material (as a measure of its intrinsic stiffness), tensile strength or resistance to mechanical fatigue are being determined. A dominant method used to study virus mechanics involves the indentation of virions or capsids by \u201cpushing\u201d on defined points on the particle surface with the AFM tip (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_18). AFM is also being used to determine the values of the physical forces involved in molecular recognition between virus particles and different ligands, for example cell receptors or antibodies, even in physiologically relevant conditions, with receptors embedded in the membrane of a cell or liposome. The general approach in these studies involves attaching a virus particle or virus ligand to the AFM tip and the interacting partner to a solid substrate, and \u201cpulling\u201d until the interaction between them is broken. Mechanical aspects of some stages in the viral cycle, such as virus entry into cells, can also be followed by AFM (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_8). Optical tweezers have been particularly successful in determining physical forces involved in the action of molecular motors during the mechanochemical process of dsDNA encapsidation inside a preformed bacteriophage capsid (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_9).",

These properties have opened up many possibilities to turn viral particles into useful biomaterials and devices in biomedicine, biotechnology and nanotechnology. However, viruses as evolved in nature do not have all of the several properties and functionalities required, or are not optimized, for any of their contemplated applications. Thus, methodologies have to be devised to manipulate virus particles and modify their structure, properties, and/or functions to serve the intended goals.
