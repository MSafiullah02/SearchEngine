They include the following: (1) to contain or eliminate the reservoirs of agents and/or to curtail the persistence of agents in a specifi c setting, (2) to protect the host against disease caused by microorganisms, and (3) to interrupt the transmission of infection. Interventions to modify environmental reservoirs are aimed at interrupting the transmission for these inanimate environmental sources. The barriers, e.g., masks, were used to keep the smells and \"contagion\" away even before the germ theory of disease was conceived. The appropriate barriers now include gloves, gowns, and eye protection for blood/body fl uid-borne infections and high-fi ltration masks for infections transmitted by droplet nuclei. The most important and effective nosocomial infection control intervention remains the routine washing of hands before, between, and after patient contact in healthcare settings. This chapter focuses on the interruption of transmission of infectious agents in the hospital setting by Standard Precautions recommended for all patients and \"isolation\" of patients using precautions based on known methods of transmission.",

            "text": "Historically, hospital construction before 1850 featured open wards where cross infection was common and mortality rates were high in urban hospitals [ 1 ] . Based on the observations during the Crimean war, Florence Nightingale advocated small pavilion -type wards joined by open-air corridors [ 2 ] . She also emphasized the importance of asepsis and a clean environment. The germ theory of disease was accepted in the US hospitals in late 1800s leading to decrease in overcrowding and increase in antisepsis. Individual and group isolation was used by \"communicable disease\" hospitals as early as 1989 [ 3 ] . General hospitals began to isolate patients with communicable diseases in individual rooms with the use of separate utensils and disinfectant by the turn of the century [ 4 ] . The theory of communicability by contact rather than airborne spread for most diseases was promoted in France [ 5 ] . This allowed patients with communicable diseases to be housed in general wards with separation by wire screens. In addition to separating the patient from others, the barrier served as a reminder for hospital staff to wear gowns and wash hands. This is how the trend of caring for patient with communicable disease in the general hospitals rather than isolation/fever hospitals started in the United States. In the early twentieth century, it was demonstrated that fumi-gation had no effect on the secondary cases emphasizing the role of persons rather than things as spreaders of disease [ 6 , 7 ] . The concept of cohorting, allowing patients with communicable diseases to be housed in the same room as other patients, was fi rst applied in the Providence City Hospital [ 5 ] . The barrier techniques needed for each patient were put on a card placed on the patient's bed. The development of infection control programs in the US hospitals was prompted by the emergence of Staphylococcus aureus as a hospital pathogen in the late 1950s. The fi rst edition of American Hospital Association's manual in 1968 presented a simple barrier precautions scheme for patients with communicable diseases and listed the need for gloves, gowns, masks, and visitor screening [ 7 ] . The CDC, while conducting nosocomial outbreak investigations in the 1960s, recognized the need for standardized policies for isolating hospitalized patients with communicable diseases [ 8 ] . The fi rst CDC isolation recommendations were published in 1970 [ 9 ] . This manual listed seven categories of isolation: strict isolation, respiratory isolation, enteric precautions, wound and skin precautions, discharge precautions, blood precautions, and protective isolation. Many of the practices described in the manual are applicable to any hospitalized patient. Application of poor techniques when handling uninfected patients can only result in sense of false security. Updates to the CDC manual were made in 1975and 1978. In 1983, substantial changes were made to the recommendations including the use of the word \"guidelines.\" The CDC series Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Nosocomial Infections that has followed is now the state of the art in infection control practices. These guidelines have accepted and customized for medical management of bioterrorism threats [ 10 ] .",

Another initiative, Body Substance Isolation, soon followed. The CDC recognized there was confusion created by Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation, so in 1996, they published new guidelines with a two-tiered method, Standard Precautions and Transmission-based Precautions. The CDC, in cooperation with the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), established Standard Precautions to address the prevention of the spread of infectious agents in healthcare settings and are the result of combining the key components from Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation along with the understanding that all blood and body fl uids, except sweat, are potentially infectious, and inanimate objects are potentially contaminated with infectious agents, therefore are capable of being reservoirs in the chain of transmission of infectious agents [ 11 , 12 ] . Does the term, \"Standard,\" downplay the role and signifi cance of these precautions? Absolutely not, the message is that this is the expected way to prevent the spread of disease and applies to every encounter between patients and healthcare providers.",

For example, gloves should be worn when contact with blood, body fl uid, or contaminated surfaces are likely. When the risk of being splashed by a potentially infectious substance exists, a mask and eye protection should be worn. A gown may be worn to protect clothing as well.

A patient suspected of having, known to have, or in the case of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms, when a patient has a history of infection or colonization and there is a risk of transmission to others, the need to isolate the patient is important for the protection of others. There are three types of Transmission-based Precautions: Contact, Droplet, and Airborne. Contact Precautions are implemented when acquisition of a pathogen can occur by touching or coming in direct contact with a patient or the articles in the patient's environment. Illnesses spread by respiratory droplets are prevented from transmission by Droplet Precautions. These infectious agents can be spread by being expelled in respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, or talking, but because the particles are large, they drop to the ground within 3-6 ft of the patient and do not pose a threat for those at a greater distance. There are some respiratory illnesses that require Airborne Precautions. Airborne Precautions require a room with special air handling capability. Negative pressure is established in the room, so that the particles, known to remain fl oating in the air for extended periods of time, can be ventilated to the outside or forced through an HEPA fi ltration system before the air is returned to circulate in the facility.",

            "text": "It is obvious that for a hospital to just say that they have and follow the CDC guidelines for prevention of transmission of infectious agents is rather bureaucratic and simplistic. The actual implementation is absolutely dependent on behavioral changes needed to support improvements in the areas of personal hygiene, specifically in the washing of hands between tasks in preparation of food, caring for children, and caring for the sick in the hospital and non-hospital settings. In the hospital setting, risks of transmission to other patients especially those with serious comorbidities and immunocompromising conditions are associated with morbidity, mortality, and cost. It is not uncommon to see healthcare workers using personal protective equipment inappropriately. For example, if a gown is not worn and tied properly, it actually be falling on top of the patient and other surfaces and become more likely to pick and transmit microorganisms. If it is not disposed properly, fl ows out of containers, the organisms can be aerosolized and transmitted in more than one way. It is the responsibility of everyone not just a few infection preventionists in the hospital to understand the principles and implement the practices of infection prevention. The practices the healthcare providers believe which protect them and their families are more likely to be adhered to. In this regard, the signifi cance of basic hand hygiene principles seems to be least valued and understood. On the other hand, they can be overzealous about isolation precautions in a given patient based on profi ling and misconceptions leading to their isolation from care. Unfortunately, this collateral damage has not received much attention.",
