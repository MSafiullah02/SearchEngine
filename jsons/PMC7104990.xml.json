A negative CPV ELISA test cannot therefore reliably exclude a diagnosis of FPV. It is important to remember that recent immunization for feline panleukopenia can result in positive results on fecal ELISA tests for up to 2 weeks, so results should be interpreted with caution in a recently vaccinated patient.2 Serology, using virus neutralizing antibodies, is regarded as the most reliable way to confirm FPV infection; a 4-fold increase in titers taken 2 weeks apart is diagnostic.1\n",

The situation in cats is certainly unclear, and no firm evidence has been presented in support of either theory. However, some cats with chronic, undefined diarrhea do show clinical improvement with antibiotic therapy. This may be due to the eradication of occult/unknown pathogens or due to an alteration in the host response to endogenous flora. If empirical antibiotics are considered for a cat with chronic diarrhea, suitable choices would include metronidazole (15 mg/kg by mouth twice daily) or tylosin (10 mg/kg by mouth 3 times daily).11 Treatment should be administered for at least 4 weeks and may need to be repeated if clinical signs recur.",

This can be easily performed in the clinic with a peppercorn-sized stool sample.
