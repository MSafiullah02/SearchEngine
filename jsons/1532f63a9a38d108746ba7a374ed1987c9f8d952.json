Given that there is no general recommendation regarding testing of asymptomatic individuals, many centers only tested symptomatic patients, so the true rate of infection is not known. None of the reported cases required intensive care because of COVID-19. Case 1 was a febrile adolescent after mediastinal radiotherapy for osteosarcoma, no information was available regarding prior chemotherapy. Case 2 was a 16year girl with febrile neutropenia after adjuvant chemotherapy for hepatoblastoma. She received azithromycin and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), no pulmonary involvement was present and after 5 days she was free of both neutropenia and fever. Also case 3 had febrile neutropenia, after chemotherapy for a cervical rhabdoid tumor. There were no radiologic signs of pulmonary involvement but she required oxygen for nightly desaturations. She received G-CSF and azithromycin and after 10 days she was dismissed from hospital. Case 4 was a 6-year boy admitted in a hospital for a cisplatin cycle for hepatoblastoma, with a COVID-19-positive swab after the end of therapy; he was discharged without therapy and remained in a good condition. Cases 1-4 were also mentioned elsewhere (Balduzzi et al, submitted). Case 5 was a child with metastatic Ewing sarcoma who developed febrile neutropenia after their 5 th cycle of chemotherapy. Case 6 was a child with Wilms' tumor who presented with fever and diarrhea after 6 weeks of chemotherapy; this child did have lymphopenia but not neutropenia. None of these two patients had respiratory symptoms, and both became afebrile within 12-24 hours. Both received hydroxychloroquine, and Case 5 also received Lopinavir-Ritonavir (LPV/r). Two more cases were reported two days after the survey responses were collected. One of them (case 7) was in febrile neutropenia treated for ALL and no data on outcome is available yet.

Thus, at least in the countries with high COVID-19 incidence, either the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was prevented by standard infection prevention measures, or cases remained undiagnosed as the course of the infection did not raise a suspicion of COVID-19.

Facial masks are recommended for all care givers and, if possible, for patients any time during personal contacts. Health professionals taking care of immunocompromised patients are separated into teams without mutual physical contact, to avoid simultaneous infection or preventative quarantine in the entire staff. This can be done by working on alternate days (unless the workload forbids it) or weeks and not sharing offices and common areas. Fewer or no in-person conferences take place. Children with respiratory symptoms are screened for SARS-CoV-2 before entering PH/O units. Outpatient visits for long-term surveillance patients are postponed. Immunosuppressed children are recommended to be isolated from general pediatric patients, where possible. Although these infection prevention measures might reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, they can also directly or indirectly complicate patient care.

More research is needed to better understand the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in pediatric patients with cancer or other immunocompromised children. More cases are expected as the pandemic is only just unfolding in many countries. This flash survey, although providing a very early picture of COVID-19, shows that the disease may have a mild course even in children receiving anticancer chemotherapy. The risk of severe disease with COVID-19 in profoundly immunocompromised children is still unknown, and predictors of asymptomatic infection, mild disease or severe and life-threatening infection would help support the development of approaches to prevent as well as to optimize treatment of COVID-19 in this vulnerable patient population.
