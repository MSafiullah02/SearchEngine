At present, they are mainly controlled by regular treatments with anthelmintic drugs. However, decades of intensive use of anthelmintics have led to the development of anthelmintic resistance. High levels of resistance against all classes of anthelmintics are reported in GI nematodes of small ruminants worldwide. Resistance against macrocyclic lactones is also emerging in cattle parasites, mainly in Cooperia spp and, to a lesser extent, Ostertagia ostertagi. Resistance against flukicides has been reported in Fasciola hepatica in several countries.",

For this, the immune system can be stimulated with either the weakened or killed pathogen or proteins/antigens from it, the so-called subunit vaccines (Fig. 1\n). Subunit vaccines can be based on a single antigen or a mixture of antigens, which can be purified from the parasites or produced through recombinant DNA technology. The approach of producing a commercial vaccine straight from worm material is not applicable for most parasite species because it is practically difficult or even impossible to obtain large enough quantities of parasite material. For this reason, recombinant vaccines have been evaluated against a range of helminths. However, maintaining the correct conformation of target antigens in recombinant form is a major challenge,3 and only a few recombinant vaccine antigens have been shown to be protective. The challenge for further development lies in delivering these promising subunit vaccines in a manner feasible for large-scale commercial production, testing their efficacy in more extensive field trials, and in making them fit for purpose for commercial and end-user uptake.2\n",

Vaccinated cattle should not be treated with anthelmintics until at least 2 weeks after the second vaccination. The vaccine can be used in healthy cattle of 8 weeks of age or older, which includes grazing young stock and adult cows. Although vaccine-induced protection is generally good,5 the vaccine has disadvantages associated with live vaccines, such as ethical issues (production of larvae in donor animals), batch heterogeneity, and a short shelf life. In an attempt to overcome these issues, several attempts were made to develop recombinant subunit vaccines, with limited success. Vaccination with recombinant acetylcholinesterase,6 paramyosin,7\n,\n8 or asparaginyl peptidase legumain-19 with different adjuvants did not result in significant and/or reproducible reduction in worm numbers or larval shedding.",

Vaccination with the vaccine also conferred protection against Haemonchus placei in grazing calves,11 but the vaccine has not been registered for use in cattle. Vaccination of young goats did not sufficiently protect against H contortus infections on pasture.12 For the production of this vaccine, the native antigens need to be extracted and purified locally from adult H contortus derived from infected sheep. A vaccine based on recombinantly expressed antigens would have advantages compared with a native antigen vaccine for reproducibility of product batches, biosafety, and global distribution. Many efforts have been made to identify and express a range of antigens from H contortus, but most recombinant proteins were unsuccessful in eliciting protective immunity.2\n,\n10 Recently, a gene encoding an Hc23 somatic antigen was identified and expressed in Escherichia coli. Lambs vaccinated with the recombinant Hc23 antigen were significantly protected against an artificial challenge infection, with more than 80% reduction in fecal egg counts (FECs) and average abomasal parasite burdens, compared with challenge controls.13 This work is a promising step toward a recombinant Haemonchus vaccine, but further experiments are needed to confirm these results and to test the vaccine in natural infection conditions.",

First grazing season calves are the most susceptible to infections with GI nematodes, and parasitic gastroenteritis is mainly seen in this age class when no appropriate preventive measures have been taken. In many parts of Europe, there is a well-defined grazing period, from spring to autumn. Helminth-naive calves should be vaccinated before turnout and the vaccine should protect them until natural immunity has sufficiently developed. Natural immunity against C oncophora develops within the first months of grazing, but immunity development against O ostertagi is slow,36 and vaccination should protect calves during their entire first grazing season. Because the peak egg output occurs around 2 months after turnout,37 it can be anticipated that reduction of worm egg shedding in the first 2 to 3 months after turnout may be sufficient to prevent accumulation of infective larvae on pasture and to protect vaccinated animals until housing in autumn.35 The authors previously suggested that a vaccine that reduces the mean fecal egg output by around 60% during the first 2 months after turnout would sufficiently protect calves against GI nematodes during their first grazing season and allow them to develop a natural immunity without production loss.30 For C oncophora, this has been shown to be an achievable goal,26 but whether this assumption holds for O ostertagi in field conditions remains to be confirmed.

Multivalent vaccines, protecting against multiple GI nematodes and/or lungworms and liver fluke, could have an obvious advantage compared with single-species vaccines.2 However, monovalent vaccines may be useful in situations in which a single parasite species dominates (eg, H contortus in warmer regions), when other parasites are controlled by alternative measures, or in regions where the risk for other parasites is low (eg, in dry regions with a low risk for liver fluke infection).2 Little or no research on multispecies helminth vaccines has been conducted, to our knowledge. No cross-protection was observed against O ostertagi when cattle were vaccinated against C oncophora with a ddASP vaccine26 despite the similarity of the ASP antigens of both worm species.",

            "text": "In many cases, vaccination is not a stand-alone solution, especially if vaccines are targeted at single parasite species and/or confer only partial protection. However, vaccination, even if only partially effective, could become an important component of integrated worm control programs.1 Anthelmintic treatment at particular time points during the vaccination schedule with the Barbervax vaccine is recommended in sheep, to cope with concurrent trichostrongylus infections or early haemonchus infections (www.barbervax.com.au). Because there is a large variability of immune responses to vaccination between individual animals,14 animals that respond poorly to vaccination may need to be identified and either treated or removed from the group. Likewise, herd immunity leads to reduced levels of pasture contamination that then helps protect those few animals that respond poorly. It would be an impossible task to test the huge number of possible scenarios arising from the combination of (multispecies) vaccines with other worm control measures in different management systems and climatic conditions in field vaccine trials. In contrast, helminth transmission models can be a useful tool for evaluating different scenarios in silico, and to select the most promising (combinations of) control methods for field testing.41\n,\n42 Barnes and colleagues43 modeled the population dynamics of Trichostrongylus colubriformis in sheep to predict the effect of different vaccines on worm population dynamics in grazing lambs. They concluded that, with vaccines based on conventional antigens, substantial benefits can be obtained with a decrease of 60% in larval establishment in 80% of the flock. These simulations have been referred to in several articles to argue that it is not essential for a vaccine against GI nematodes in ruminants to obtain 100% efficacy (or even >90%) in all animals. However, these results cannot be readily extrapolated to other host-parasite systems; for example, when suppressed egg production is the main effect of vaccine-induced immunity rather than decreased larval establishment.35 Turner and colleagues44 developed a mathematical model to simulate the effectiveness of liver fluke vaccines under field conditions. The model output suggests that current vaccine candidates have the potential to reduce the mean total fluke burden by 43% and mean daily egg output by as much as 99% under field conditions. However, to be effective, a vaccine should protect at least 90% of the animals during the whole grazing season. It seems unlikely that this level and duration of protection can be achieved with vaccination alone, but vaccines could contribute substantially toward fasciolosis control, reducing usage of anthelmintics and thus delaying the spread of anthelmintic resistance.44\n",

Despite the need to vaccinate sheep on a regular basis and to combine vaccination with anthelmintic treatments, farmers are willing to use the vaccine because anthelmintics alone have become insufficient to control haemonchus infections in regions with high levels of anthelmintic resistance. In contrast, the lungworm vaccine is not used extensively in many countries, despite good vaccine efficacy. Practical concerns, such as a short shelf life, and the availability of anthelmintics with a persistent efficacy against Dictyocaulus, apparently have made the vaccine a less attractive control option.",
