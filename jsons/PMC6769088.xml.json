However, SRS technologies have inherent limitations both in genome and transcriptome analyses. This approach does not perform adequately in mapping repetitive elements and GC-rich DNA sequences, or in discriminating paralogous sequences. In transcriptome research, SRS techniques have difficulties in identifying multi-spliced transcripts, overlapping transcripts, transcription start site (TSS), and transcription end site (TES) isoforms, as well as multigenic RNA molecules.",

The LRS technology is able to read full-length RNA molecules, therefore it is ideal for application in the analysis of complex transcriptomic profiles. Currently two techniques are available in the market, the California-based Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and the British Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. The PacBio approach is based on single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technology, while the ONT platform utilizes the nanopore sequencing concept. Both techniques have already been applied for the structural and dynamic transcriptomic analysis of various organisms (Byrne et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Nudelman et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019), including viruses (Boldogk\u0151i et al., 2019b), such as herpesviruses (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2015; O\u2019Grady et al., 2016; Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2016; Bal\u00e1zs et al., 2017a; Bal\u00e1zs et al., 2017b; Moldov\u00e1n et al., 2017b; Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2017b; Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2017a; Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2018b; Depledge et al., 2019), poxviruses (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2018a), baculoviruses (Moldov\u00e1n et al., 2018b), retroviruses (Moldov\u00e1n et al., 2018a), coronaviruses (Viehweger et al., 2019), and circoviruses (Moldov\u00e1n et al., 2017a). Additionally, the ONT technology is capable of sequencing DNA and RNA in its native form, allowing epigenetic and epitranscriptomic analysis (Wongsurawat et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2019).",

The most common symptom of HSV-1 infection is cold sores, which can recur from latency causing blisters primarily on the lips. HSV-1 may cause acute encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. The ability of herpesviruses to establish lifelong latency within the host organism significantly contributes to their evolutionary success: according to WHO\u2019s estimates, more than 3.7 billion people under the age of 50 are infected with HSV-1 worldwide (Looker et al., 2015).",

Both the long (UL) and the short (US) unique regions are flanked by inverted repeats (IRLs and IRSs, respectively) (Macdonald et al., 2012). The viral genome is transcribed by the host RNA polymerase in a cascade-like manner producing three kinetic classes of transcripts and proteins: immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L) (Harkness et al., 2014). IE genes encode transcription factors required for the expression of E and L genes. E genes mainly code for proteins playing a role in DNA synthesis, whereas L genes specify structural elements of the virus. Earlier studies and in silico annotations have revealed 89 mRNAs, 10 non-coding (nc)RNAs (Raj\u010d\u00e1ni et al., 2004; McGeoch et al., 2006; Macdonald et al., 2012; Lim, 2013; Hu et al., 2016), and 18 microRNAs (Du et al., 2015). Our recent study (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2017b) based on PacBio RS II sequencing has identified additional 142 transcripts and transcript isoforms, including ncRNAs. The detection and the kinetic characterization of HSV-1 transcriptome face an important challenge because of the overlapping and polycistronic nature of the viral transcripts. Polycistronic transcription units are different from those of bacterial operons, in that the downstream genes on multigenic transcripts are untranslated because herpesvirus mRNAs use cap-dependent translation initiation (Merrick, 2004). The majority of herpesvirus transcripts are organized into tandem gene clusters generating overlapping transcripts with co-terminal TESs. The ul41-44 genomic region of HSV-1 does not follow this rule, since these genes are primarily expressed as monocistronic RNA molecules. Our earlier study has revealed that these genes also produce low-abundance bi- and polycistronic transcripts. Alternatively, many HSV-1 genes, which were believed to be exclusively expressed as parts of multigenic RNAs, have also been shown to specify low-abundance monocistronic transcripts (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2017b).",

            "text": "SRS technologies have become useful tools for the analysis of transcriptomes. However, conventionally applied SRS platforms cannot reliably distinguish between multi-spliced transcript isoforms, and TSS variants, as well as between embedded transcripts and their host RNAs, etc. Additionally, SRS, even if applied in conjunction with auxiliary techniques such as RACE analysis, has limitations in detecting multigenic transcripts, including polycistronic RNAs and complex transcripts (cxRNAs; containing genes standing in opposite orientations). LRS is able to circumvent these problems. Both PacBio and ONT approaches are capable of reading cDNAs generated from full-length transcripts in a single sequencing run and permit mapping of TSSs and TESs with base-pair precision. The most important disadvantage of LRS compared to SRS techniques is lower coverage. In PacBio sequencing, if any errors occur in raw reads, they are easily corrected thanks to the very high consensus accuracy of this technique (Miyamoto et al., 2014). Thus, it is only a widespread myth that SMRT sequencing is too error prone to be used for precise sequence analysis. The precision of basecalling is substantially lower for ONT platform than that of PacBio, but the former technique is far more cost-effective, and yields both higher throughput and longer reads. The high error rate of the ONT technique can be circumvented by obtaining high sequence coverage. Nonetheless, this latter problem is not critical in transcriptome research if the genome sequence of the examined organism has already been annotated.",

We used both cDNA and direct (d)RNA sequencing on the ONT platform. Additionally, we applied Cap-selection for ONT sequencing. In order to identify non-polyadenylated transcripts, we also applied random oligonucleotide primer-based RT in addition to the oligo(dT)-priming. Furthermore, the latter technique is more efficient for the mapping of the TSSs, and it is useful for the validation of novel RNA molecules. Our intentions of using novel LRS techniques were to analyze the dynamic viral transcriptome, to generate a higher number of sequencing reads, and to identify novel transcripts that had been undetected in our earlier PacBio RS II-based approach.

The reason behind the relatively low proportion of the full-length read count within the MinION samples is that this method\u2014compared to PacBio\u2014generates a higher number of 5\u2019 truncated reads. We and others have reported in previous publications that the dRNA-Seq method is not optimal for capturing entire transcripts (Moldov\u00e1n et al., 2017b; Moldov\u00e1n et al., 2018b; Workman et al., 2018): we found that short 5\u2019 sequences of transcripts and in many cases the polyA-tails were missing from most of the reads. However, a recently published technique utilizing adapter ligation to the 5\u2019 end of full-length mRNAs is able to solve this problem (Jiang et al., 2019). Another drawback of native RNA sequencing is its low throughput compared to cDNA sequencing. The advantage of dRNA-Seq is that it is free of false products which are typically produced by RT, PCR, and cDNA sequencing.",

These analyses yielded altogether 537 TSSs and 77 TESs. Only those sequencing reads were accepted as transcripts, which contained a TSS and a TES annotated in the above way. This method yielded 667 transcripts (\nSupplementary Table 3\n).

A large number of very long transcripts were identified this way in most cases in the Sequel dataset. Thus, altogether 2,250 transcripts were identified in this study (\nSupplementary Table 3\n).

Present investigations revealed 182 novel 5\u2019-truncated mRNAs (tmRNAs) of HSV-1 (\nSupplementary Table 4\n), which were all produced from genes embedded in larger host genes of the virus. These 5\u2019-truncated mRNAs are assumed to be generated by alternative transcription initiation from promoters located within larger genes. We could identify promoter modules for only 39 transcripts (we could not identify promoter consensus sequences for several canonical ORFs, too). These transcripts all contain in-frame ORFs.

It has earlier been reported that the 0.7-kb LAT transcript is not expressed in strain KOS of HSV-1 (Zhu et al., 1999). Here we demonstrate that this is not the case, since we were able to detect this transcript. The existence of the shorter LAT-0.7kb-S (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2017b) was also confirmed. Additionally, we detected asRNAs being co-terminal with the LAT-0.7 transcripts, but having much longer TSSs. The LAT region and its surrounding genomic sequences are illustrated in \nFigure 2A\n. Using random oligonucleotide-based LRS techniques, we obtained a large number of antisense-oriented reads, most of them without identified 5\u2019-ends. We also detected antisense transcripts without defined TSSs and TESs within 27 HSV-1 genes (rl1, rl2, ul1, ul2, ul4, ul5, ul10, ul14, ul15, ul19, ul23, ul29, ul31, ul32, ul36, ul37, ul39, ul42, ul43, ul44, ul49, ul50, ul53, ul54, us4, us5, us8). The expression level of these asRNAs is low, in most cases only a few reads were detected per gene locus. However, a high level of antisense RNA expression was identified within the locus of ul10 gene. A special class of asRNAs is produced by divergent genes, and read-through RNAs (rtRNAs) generated by transcriptional read-through between convergent gene pairs. These transcripts are mRNAs with long stretches of antisense segments. For example, we detected an antisense transcript originated within the 3\u2019 region of ul4 gene and co-terminated with UL6-7 bicistronic transcript. This RNA molecule contains three splice sites, and can be considered as a very long TSS isoform of the UL6-7 transcript.",

The LoRTIA software suit \u2014 used for the detection of TSS and TES positions \u2014 identified 218 TSS and 56 TES positions (\nSupplementary Table 2\n). Altogether 53 genes produce at least one TSS isoform, besides the most frequent variants (\nSupplementary Table 3\n). Fifteen genes were found to produce three different transcript length isoforms (including the most frequent versions). The recent LRS analysis discovered 51 protein-coding and 2 (0.7 kb LAT, and RS1) non-coding transcripts with alternative TSSs. However, a few transcripts with unannotated 5\u2019-ends were also detected (\nSupplementary Table 3\n). The alternative TSSs may lead to transcriptional overlap or they may enlarge the extent of existing overlaps especially between divergently transcribed genes. Some transcripts (e.g. UL19 and UL10) exhibit an especially high complexity of TSS isoforms (\nFigure 4A\n). The ul21 gene produces nine different 5\u2019 length variants, the longer ones overlap the divergently oriented ul22 gene) (\nFigure 4B\n). Additionally, long TSS isoforms are responsible for the overlaps of each replication origin of HSV-1, which is not the case in PRV, its close relative (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2015; Boldogk\u0151i et al., 2019a). Many of the longer TSS variants contain upstream ORFs (uORFs), which may carry distinct coding potentials as described by Bal\u00e1zs and colleagues in the human cytomegalovirus (Bal\u00e1zs et al., 2017a).

            "text": "Our earlier survey has revealed several novel multigenic RNAs, including polycistronic and complex transcripts (Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2017b). In this work, we identified 201 multigenic transcripts containing two or more genes (\nSupplementary Table 3\n). The cxRNAs are long RNA molecules with at least 2 genes standing in opposite orientation relative to one another. Our intriguing findings are the RL1-RL2 (ICP34,5-ICP0) bicistronic transcript, as well as the 0.7. kb LAT-UL1-2-3-3.5 cxRNA (\nFigures 2A, B\n). Most of the novel multigenic transcripts are expressed at low levels, which can explain why they had previously gone undetected. In this work, we also identified four novel complex transcripts (0.7 kb LAT-UL1-2-c, UL18-15.5-c, UL20-21-c, US4-3-2-c) with unannotated TSSs (\nFigure 2A\n). We were able to detect these transcripts by cDNA sequencing and by the reanalysis of a MinION dRNA sequencing dataset (Depledge et al., 2019). Our novel experiments validated previously published cxRNAs. This study demonstrates that full-length overlaps between two divergently-oriented HSV-1 genes are an important source for the cxRNA molecules. The likely reason for the lack of cxRNA TSSs in many cases is that they are very long and low-abundance transcripts. It cannot be excluded with absolute certainty that some of the low-abundance multigenic transcripts are artefacts produced by the template\u2013switch mechanism; other approaches are needed for the validation of their existence one-by-one.",

            "text": "This study revealed an immense complexity of transcriptional overlaps (\nFigure 6\n and \nTable 6\n). These overlaps are produced by either transcriptional read-through events between transcripts oriented in parallel [as described in Kara et al. (2019)], or in a convergent manner (thereby generating rtRNAs), or through the use of long TSS isoforms pertaining to one or of both partners of divergently-oriented genes. Transcriptional overlaps can also be produced by antisense transcripts controlled by their own promoters, as seen in LAT transcripts. Besides the \u2018soft\u2019 (alternative) overlaps, adjacent genes can also produce \u2018hard\u2019 overlaps when only overlapping transcripts are produced from the same gene pairs. An important novelty of this study is the discovery that practically each convergent gene produces rtRNAs crossing the boundaries of the adjacent genes. Two of the convergent gene pairs (ul3-ul4 and ul30-ul31) form \u2018hard\u2019 transcriptional overlaps, whereas the other gene pairs form \u2018soft\u2019 overlaps. The \u2018softly\u2019 overlapping convergent transcripts are likely to be non-polyadenylated, since we were only able to detect most of them by the random primer-based sequencing technique. The ul3-ul4 and ul30-31 gene pairs also express non-polyadenylated rtRNAs that extend beyond their poly(A) sites. Transcriptional read-troughs were detected between each convergent gene pair in most cases from both directions, except in the UL43-44-45/UL48-47-46 cluster (\nFigure 6\n and \nTable 6\n). Another important novelty of this study is the discovery of very long TSS variants of divergent transcripts, the 5\u2019-UTRs of which entirely overlap the partner gene. We detected very long transcripts which overlap the following divergent gene clusters: ul4-5/ul6-7, ul4-5/ul6-7, ul4-5/ul6-7, ul4-5/ul6-7, ul9-8/ul10, ul9-8/ul10, ul14-13-12-11/ul15, ul17/ul15e2, ul20-19-18/ul21, ul20-19-18/ul21, ulL23-22/ul24-25-26, ul29/OriL/ul30, ul29/OriL/ul30, ul32-31/ul33-34-35, ul37/ul38-39-40, ul41-ul42, ul49.5.49/ul50, ul51/ul52-53-54, us2/US3, us2/us3, us2/us3.

This research yielded a number of novel transcripts and transcript isoforms. We identified novel tmRNAs embedded into larger host viral genes. All of these short novel transcripts contain in-frame ORFs, but it does not necessarily mean that this coding potency is realized in translation. Indeed, most of the putative tmRNAs are expressed in low abundance (these were not accepted as transcripts), which raises doubts as to whether they code for proteins. These transcripts might have a regulatory role in certain step(s) of gene expression, but we cannot exclude that they represent mere transcriptional noise.",

It is possible that increasing coverage further would reveal that transcripts are initiated from a promoter at each nucleotide within a certain stretch of DNA with varying probabilities.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule, e.g. the ul41-43 and ul51-49 regions. Both the regular and the irregular gene clusters exhibit time course differences in their location in mono- and various polycistronic RNAs. Genes are also transcribed in various combinations on RNA molecules but the expression of most genes follows the prototypic organization. All in all, this study identified several novel RNA molecules, and transcript isoforms. Further studies have to be carried out to ascertain the function of these transcripts. The question might be raised as to whether the low-abundance transcripts have any function at all, or whether they are the product of transcriptional noise. These transcripts may also be the by-products of a genome-wide regulatory mechanism discussed above, or they may also be functional.",
