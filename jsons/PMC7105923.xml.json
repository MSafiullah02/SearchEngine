TCM can be considered as a natural combinatorial chemical library, compared with synthetic ones. TCM presents more diversity in structure and bioactivity, and less toxicity [2]. Therefore, it represents an attractive source of new active compounds in drug discovery [3, 4]. The conventional approach to find active compounds in TCM involves selecting a potential plant and isolating compounds following bioassay guidance. This approach has been playing an important part in drug development. However, it is often time-consuming and can contain false positives (see Outstanding issues).",

Then several high scoring candidate compounds were selected according to an energy and geometry match.

The structure was modified to improve bioactivity [12] and resulted in nine compounds with IC50\n < 1 \u03bcm/ml [13]. The binding energy was calculated by the molecular mechanics/Possion\u2013Bolzman surface area (MM/PBSA) method, and the results showed that the binding energies were parallel to IC50 [11].",

Molecularly imprinted polymers are extensively cross-linked polymers containing specific recognition sites with a predetermined selectivity for analytes of interest. The technique involves complexation in a solution of target molecules (template) with functional monomers through either covalent or noncovalent bonds, followed by a polymerization reaction with an excess of cross-linkers. Removal of the templates leaves behind specific recognition sites that are complementary to the template in terms of its shape, size and functionality in the polymer network. These recognition sites enable imprinted polymers to be used as the mimics of enzymes, receptors and antibodies for screening various kinds of compounds from a mixture with abundant interferences.",

It is based on the continuous infusion of ligands over a protein target immobilized onto a solid support column, with the eluting ligands detected by MS. When ligands flow through the column, they bind to the target with differing affinities. The breakthrough volume of ligand is dependent on the affinity of the ligand for the target.Eq. (1) is the basic equation of frontal affinity chromatography:(1)V\u2212V0=Lt(c+Kd)It also can be shown in other form:(2)1c(V\u2212V0)=1Lt+KdLt\u22c51cwhere V is the elution volume of the analyte, c is the concentration of the analyte, V\n0 is the elution volume of a controlled substance having no affinity, Lt is the total amount of immobilized ligand, and K\nd is the dissociation constant. V approaches its maximum value, V\nm. If c\n \u226a \nK\nd, that is, as c is neglibly small compared with K\nd, the following equation is obtained:(3)Vm\u2212V0=L0Kd\n\nMIP-SPE (MISPE): the basic concept for the application of MIP in solid phase extraction (MISPE) is that the chromatographic parameters are tuned such that the MISPE column traps only the analytes, or a group of structurally related compounds, whereas the other interfering components in the sample matrix were washed without retention.\nTCM: traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a medical science governing the theory and practice of traditional medicine. It includes Chinese medication, pharmacology/herbalogy, acupuncture, massage and Qigong. In this article, TCM only is related with traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.\n",
