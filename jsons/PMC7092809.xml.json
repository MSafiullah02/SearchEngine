First described in 1952 in present-day Tanzania, the early CHIKF cases were treated as Dengue virus (DENV) infection (Lumsden, 1955). Following isolation of CHIKV from infected patients\u2019 sera, as well as Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) and Culex spp. mosquitoes in 1953, the virus was placed in the arbovirus group A (Ross, 1956; Calisher and Karabatsos, 1988). Currently, CHIKV is grouped within the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family, and identified as member of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) antigenic complex (van Duijl-Richter et al., 2015; ICTV, 2017).",

With the advent of nucleic acid sequencing and tools enabling the elucidation of molecular evolution, these CHIKV strains were grouped and named according to geographical location of isolation: East-, Central- and South African lineage (ECSA) (Powers et al., 2000). Phylogenetic analysis of CHIKV isolated during outbreaks from 1958 to 1973 in Asia placed them into another monophyletic group called Asian lineage (Powers et al., 2000; Volk et al., 2010). By the end of the 20th century, phylogenetic inferences based on CHIKV isolated from mosquitoes from West Africa (Senegal) demonstrated still another viral lineage, geographically more restricted, known as West African (WA) (Powers et al., 2000; Volk et al., 2010).",

Reverse genetics studies proved the importance of the E1-A226 V mutation for viral fitness in Ae. albopictus (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007). Currently, the E1-A226 V substitution is thought to enhance viral infectivity in Ae. albopictus midgut cells due to the proximity of amino acid 226 to the fusion peptide, which is responsible for viral release from the endosome during early stages of the infection. Notably, this mutation did not compromise viral replication in Ae. aegypti (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007). Mutations in the same (or similar) position on the glycoprotein E1 have been reported in other alphavirus, such as SFV and Sindbis virus (SINV), and also have been associated with an increase of the capacity of infection and viral exit in Ae. albopictus (C6/36) cell line (Vashishtha et al., 1998; Lu et al., 1999).",

In 2010, imported cases from Indonesia, Reunion Island, India and Asia were identified respectively in Taiwan, France, USA and in Brazil (Rezza et al., 2007; Thiberville et al., 2013; Brasil, 2014). In 2013, CHIKV arrived on the American continent, initially spreading in the Caribbean, before reaching Brazil in 2014 (Nunes et al., 2015). Two years later, in 2015, CHIKV was declared a notifiable disease by the CDC (CDC, 2015). The most recent CHIKV outbreak was reported in Mombasa, Kenya, in February 2018 (WHO, 2018).",

Moreover, the C-reactive protein is generally elevated in the acute phase illness (Table 2) (Venugopalan et al., 2014; Brito and Cordeiro, 2016; PAHO, 2017). Elevation of hepatic enzymes, as well as elevated creatinine and creatine phosphokinase levels, have also been reported (Danis-Lozano et al., 2017). The different laboratory patterns observed during CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV infections, added to clinical findings, may be incorporated to support a correct diagnosis (Table 1, Table 2).",

Moreover, ELISA for CHIKV diagnosis are highly specific and have a high accuracy (Johnson et al., 2016). IgM antibody-capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA), via which IgM antibodies can be detected in serum samples collected from four days after onset of symptoms, are the most commonly used tests for laboratory-based diagnoses (Reddy et al., 2012). PRNT, used as a parameter to measure circulating neutralizing antibodies, is useful to establish immunoprotection levels based on the determination of serum antibody titers required to neutralize a known amount of infectious virus particles (Azami et al., 2016). Alternative techniques for anti-CHIKV antibody detection include immunofluorescence and hemagglutination inhibition (Staples et al., 2009).",

To overcome these obstacles, integrated anti-virus control is required and should include: a) epidemiological surveillance; b) environmental management focusing on educative actions to eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites and reduce standing water sites; c) chemical control using repellents (mainly for travelers and pregnant women) and insecticides, respecting the vectors resistance; and d) biological control against eggs, larvae and mosquitoes (Fig. 3\n) (Hemingway and Ranson, 2000; Dumont and Chiroleu, 2010; Benelli, 2015; Benelli et al., 2016; Islam et al., 2017; Benelli, 2018).",

An anti-CHIKV strategy involves the development of an attenuated chimeric vaccine using the Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) of the Encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV). In this approach, the CHIKV subgenomic promoter from the LR2006-OPY1 strain (ECSA lineage) is knocked via insertion of 13 synonymous mutations and the ECMV IRES sequence is added as new promoter for subgenomic RNA transcription (Plante et al., 2011). Briefly, the addition of the IRES sequence to the attenuated viral genome prevents viral propagation in mosquito cells, thus restricting the target population. This vaccine strategy has been shown to lead to the stimulation of TCD4 and TCD8 responses in mice (Plante et al., 2011). In NHP, CHIKV/IRES vaccine was also showed to be safe and immunogenically effective (Roy et al., 2014). Finally, the preclinical safety of the CHIKV/IRES vaccine was ensured in interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-incompetent mice (A129 mice) (Plante et al., 2015).",

The ELIV/CHIKV possesses non-structural proteins of EILV and structural and accessory proteins of 99659 CHIKV strain (Asian lineage). Since the EILV is an alphavirus specific for insects, the EILV/CHIKV was unable to replicate in vertebrate hosts, thereby providing a high degree of safety. In NHP, ELIV/CHIKV stimulated immune response and guaranteed protection against viremia (Erasmus et al., 2017).",

            "text": "In the last decade, there has been an increase in the dissemination and co-circulation of several arboviruses. Currently, areas that were endemic just to DENV, for instance, are with autochthonous cases of chikungunya and Zika diseases. These arboviruses have similar clinical spectrum and require an efficient laboratory diagnosis, especially for a rigorous epidemiological surveillance. In addition, CHIKV infections represent a serious public health problem. The high morbidity of chikungunya often results in absenteeism of afflicted individuals, incurring both psychosocial and economic impacts. In this context, the development of a specific anti-CHIKV drug is certainly an important demand. On the other hand, the ideal control strategy for CHIKV should combine an integrated vector management with mass immunization. Although the different vector biocontrol strategies are promising, mainly within an integrated use, it is necessary to think about their sustainable use, assessing their real impacts on ecosystem equilibrium. The absence of CHIKV serotypes is considered a facilitative aspect in anti-CHIKV vaccine development, since a formulation developed from one strain will likely result in immunity against all CHIKV (Smalley et al., 2016). Despite recent advances in vaccine strategies, the major challenge regarding CHIKV vaccine development remains the establishment of an equilibrium between immunogenicity and safety, notably a reduction of side effects, such as secondary arthralgia following immunization with attenuated virus. Finally, recognizing the competence of vector and arboviruses control measures, we believe that the prevention of CHIKV infections should be planned within a global and multifactorial approach. This interdisciplinary strategy, currently framed within the One Health concept, should thus integrate all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment (Benelli and Duggan, 2018).",
