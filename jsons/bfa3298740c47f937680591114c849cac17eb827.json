            "text": "Hospitals around the world are ramping up their services to accommodate patients infected with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although healthcare workers (HCW) are at significant risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the deficit of personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect HCWs from infection has been a major recurring concern. Recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment to protect against SARS-CoV-2 exposure by HCWs were recently published by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Dise ase Control and Prevention. For aerosol-generating procedure, N95 respirators, eye protection, isolation gowns, and gloves were recommended. Coveralls, boots with a cover, and hair coverings were not part of the recommended protective clothing 1 .",

The center for disease control (CDC) along with American Heart Association (AHA) has issued recommendations for CPR, endotracheal intubation, and noninvasive ventilation to minimize aerosol generation and protect the HCW 3 . Some of these recommendations especially for CPR include holding chest compression during intubation and trying to establish airway early in the resuscitation to minimize aerosol generation. Barrier enclosures have been previously described to minimize contamination of HCW during aerosol generating procedures. However, no such modality has been described to protect HCWs while performing CPR. Here we describe a model to lower contamination by aerosol of HCWs during simulated CPR.",

We pulled the mayo stand as shown in figure over the head of the patient, adjusted the height of the stand, and covered it with the plastic sheet to fully enclose the mouth and face of the patient before we started the CPR. In our simulation, the person performing chest compression was stationed to the right side of the manikin 'victim' who is not intubated. The model simulates the beginning of cardiac arrest resuscitation before a definitive airway is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f established. The HCW performing chest compression is donned in appropriate PPE as per CDC guidelines. Glow germ \u2122 was used to simulate aerosols during the CPR.",
