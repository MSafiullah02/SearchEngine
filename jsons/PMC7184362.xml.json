To this end, we wish to emphasize the importance of following current guidance and advice from Public Health Agency of Canada on infection prevention and control for COVID-19. It is imperative that all endoscopy facilities, whether they are hospital endoscopy units, out-of-hospital premises or independent health facilities, develop institutional protocols and policies that are consistent with national, provincial and local municipal recommendations for infection control to reduce the spread of COVID-19 to both patients and personnel.",

It is important to note that the proposed measures are based on current limited understanding of the incubation period, mechanisms of transmission, clinical course and the duration of infectivity. As well, the evidence supporting the use of these measures is largely based on prior experience from other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Figure 1 summarizes CAG guidance on infection prevention and control for COVID-19 when performing endoscopic procedures (as of March 16, 2020).",

Guidance may rapidly change with increasing evidence and understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19. aEndoscopy facilities should define and repeatedly adjust criteria for essential endoscopic procedures, based on the rate of loss of personnel and resources, and the rapidly evolving local and global epidemiology of COVID-19. Given the limited resources of N95, each institution will have to decide on the criteria for essential GI procedures. If the resources are too low, the institution may have to severely restrict GI procedures to only life-threatening GI bleeding, obstruction of esophagus by food bolus or foreign body, and ascending cholangitis. bRisk assessment and stratification of patients should be repeatedly adjusted based on rapidly evolving local and global epidemiology of COVID-19. cUpper GI procedures are considered high risk procedures for COVID-19 transmission. Insufficient evidence to consider lower GI procedures high-risk procedures for COVID-19 transmission at present.",
