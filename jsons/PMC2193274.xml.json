Early studies demonstrated that Qa-1 can be directly recognized by alloreactive cytolytic CD8+ T cells 5\n6. Like most class Ib molecules, Qa-1 is relatively nonpolymorphic 7\n8. It is expressed in a wide range of tissues 3\n9 but cell-surface expression appears to be low and the cellular half-life is relatively short 4. A series of studies on the specificity of Qa-1\u2013specific alloreactive T cells led to the discovery that a major fraction of Qa-1\u2013restricted CTLs recognize a nine\u2013amino acid peptide (AMAPRTLLL) from the leader sequence of H-2D or L molecules 9\n10\n11. This peptide is termed Qa-1 determinant modifier (Qdm). Recognition by a subset of CTLs was sensitive to a polymorphism mapping to H-2D, with Val instead of Ala in the third position in the Dk leader peptide. Presentation of Qdm by Qa-1 was shown to be dependent on the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 10\n11. Subsequent peptide elution studies demonstrated that the predominant peptide associated with Qa-1 on mitogen-activated T cells and transfected fibroblasts was Qdm 12\n13.",

            "text": "Despite evidence that Qa-1 molecules are dominantly loaded with a single peptide, Qdm, several studies suggest that Qa-1 can bind and present other antigens to T cells. Vidovic et al. reported that recognition of the copolymer Glu-50-Tyr-50 by a \u03b3/\u03b4 T cell hybridoma was blocked by anti\u2013Qa-1 Abs 14. Imani and Soloski demonstrated that a tryptic digest of Mycobacterium bovis heat shock protein (hsp) 65 could stabilize Qa-1 expression on the surface of transfected cells, suggesting that Qa-1 may be capable of binding an hsp-derived peptide(s) 15. Recent studies have demonstrated that CD8+ CTLs are generated in mice after infection with Salmonella typhimurium with specificity for a nine\u2013amino acid epitope in bacterial GroEL and cross-reactivity with a corresponding mouse hsp60 peptide 16\n17. Qa-1\u2013restricted CD8+ T cells with specificity for Listeria monocytogenes have also been demonstrated, but the epitope(s) remain to be defined 18\n19. We previously reported the characterization of Qa-1b\u2013restricted T cell hybridomas derived from low-responder H-2b mice immunized with pork insulin 20. These T cells recognized an insulin B chain determinant generated though a TAP-independent processing pathway. Finally, Qa-1\u2013restricted regulatory CD8+ T cells have been described with the capacity to specifically kill activated V\u03b28+ T cells 21\n22. These T cells, induced by vaccination with V\u03b28+ T cells or staphylococcal enterotoxin B injection, presumably recognize T cell receptor\u2013derived peptides presented by Qa-1. These various observations raise the possibility that Qa-1 may have a capacity to bind and present a diverse repertoire of peptides. However, the range of peptides that can be presented is uncertain and the Qa-1 peptide\u2013binding motif has not been defined.",

Heterodimers of NKG2 family members with CD94 recognize HLA-E in humans 27\n28\n29. Like Qa-1, HLA-E appears to bind predominantly to certain peptides derived from class I leader sequences 30\n31. In addition, these two proteins have Ser at the normally conserved positions 143 and 147 instead of Thr and Trp, respectively, which are found in other class I molecules. Despite these shared features, Qa-1 and HLA-E are not obvious orthologues based on sequence comparison. HLA-E cell surface expression appears to be dependent on TAP function and coexpression of a class I molecule containing an appropriate leader sequence to serve as a source of peptide 31\n32. In contrast, Qa-1 can be expressed in the absence of TAP and cell surface Qa-1 is not further stabilized in TAP-deficient cells by exogenous Qdm peptide 23. This finding is consistent with the idea that Qa-1 may have a capacity to bind peptides other than Qdm through a TAP-independent mechanism. Alternatively, Qa-1 may be expressed without bound peptide; empty Qa-1 molecules could be unusually stable.",

Human NKG2C and NKG2E lack immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, and at least CD94/NKG2C has a capacity to activate NK cells through association with the small signaling homodimer, DAP12 34. Mouse homologues of these activating receptors have been identified, and they share specificity with the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptor for Qa-1 25. NKG2C and NKG2E mRNA is considerably less abundant than that encoding NKG2A in mouse NK cells, but the distribution of activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cell populations remains to be characterized. Several studies suggest that human CD94/NKG2 receptors may have a capacity to discriminate between HLA-E complexes containing different leader sequence\u2013derived peptides 35\n36\n37. The molecular basis of specificity for leader peptides and functional implications remain to be characterized. We previously reported that Qa-1 molecules expressed in TAP-deficient cells were unable to inhibit NK cell function unless exogenous Qdm peptide was provided 23. This indicated that Qa-1\u2013bound peptide is required to generate a functional ligand for murine CD94/NKG2A, but the capacity of this receptor to discriminate between different Qa-1\u2013peptide complexes remained to be addressed.",

The P3 anchor appeared to be rather promiscuous with enrichment for seven different residues. Of the five anchor positions identified above from binding studies with substituted Qdm peptides, the residues found in the Qdm sequence were only identified as anchors at P2, P6, and P7 from pool sequence analysis. Enrichment for selected amino acids was also observed at each nonanchor position. Among these, the Qdm residue Arg was enriched at P5.

However, preferred residues at nonanchor positions are commonly observed in this type of study 45\n46\n47\n48.

The COOH-terminal position is in general a dominant anchor for class I MHC\u2013binding peptides with a high degree of selectivity for one or a few chemically related (usually hydrophobic or positively charged) residues 45\n48.",

Preference for Met and Leu at P2 was identified through both approaches. Similarly, common preferences for Thr at P6 and Pro, Ile, and Leu at P7 were identified. By contrast, few common amino acids were identified as preferred at P3 with the two approaches. It is evident, however, that there is little stringency at this position. The observation that Leu is highly preferred among Qdm peptides randomized at P9 markedly contrasts with the results of our study with the fully random peptide library that showed no enrichment for Leu at this position. This difference might be accounted for by direct or indirect cooperative interactions between amino acid residues at different positions. In the context of the Qdm sequence, the P9 position could be constrained, imposing a stringent requirement for Leu at this position. In the context of other sequences, this preference could conceivably change. Alternatively, the reduced signal attributed to the \u201cwashout\u201d that is inevitably associated with later cycles of Edman degradation may have obscured a preference for Leu at P9 in our experiments with the fully random library. Both experimental approaches indicated that Arg and Tyr are preferred at the putative nonanchor P5 position.

In H-2b cells, the only known source of Qdm is Db since Kb does not have the correct motif in its leader sequence. The role of Db in inhibition of NK lysis was investigated in chromium-release assays with targets expressing Qa-1 in the presence or absence of Db. IL-2\u2013activated CD94/NKG2-positive Kb\u2212/\u2212 NK cells were used as effectors. A small degree of lysis of autologous Kb\u2212/\u2212 target cells was observed (Fig. 4). This may be due to partial reversal of self-tolerance, which has sometimes been observed when NK cells are cultured in high concentrations of IL-2 49. However, the Db molecule on Kb\u2212/\u2212 targets clearly inhibited lysis because Kb\u2212/\u2212Db\u2212/\u2212 targets were lysed much better than Kb\u2212/\u2212 targets. Confirmation that the leader peptide could inhibit NK cells was obtained by incubating Kb\u2212/\u2212 Db\u2212/\u2212 targets with exogenous Qdm; this treatment resulted in potent inhibition of NK-mediated lysis as shown in a previous study with Kb\u2212/\u2212D\u2212/\u2212 targets 50. The effect of Qdm appeared to depend on Qa-1 expression since killing of \u03b22m\u2212/\u2212 targets, which do not express Qa-1, was not inhibited by exogenous Qdm peptide (Fig. 4). Importantly, killing of Kb\u2212/\u2212Db\u2212/\u2212 targets was indistinguishable from killing of \u03b22m\u2212/\u2212 targets, suggesting that Db is essential for inhibition of NK cells under our experimental conditions.

This question became particularly relevant in light of the observation that Qa-1 has the potential to bind a relatively diverse repertoire of peptides. This issue was further investigated by generating fluorescent soluble tetrameric Qa-1b complexes bearing Qdm peptides with substitutions at different nonanchor positions. As previously reported 23, tetramers generated from Qa-1b folded with Qdm peptide bind to 40\u201350% of splenic NK cells (Fig. 5 A). Staining with tetramers containing the Dk leader sequence, which contains Val instead of Ala at P3, was somewhat reduced compared with Qdm, yet a substantial fraction of NK cells clearly binds this reagent. By contrast, little if any staining was observed with tetramers containing substituted Qdm peptides with Lys at P1, P4, P5, or P8. To confirm the specificity of NK cell staining, a parallel experiment was performed with transfectants expressing high levels of CD94/NKG2A. No tetramer staining was observed with control cells that did not express CD94/NKG2A heterodimer 23. Qa-1 tetramers containing Qdm or the Dk leader peptide stained the transfectants uniformly (Fig. 5 B). No staining was observed with peptides containing substitutions at P4, P5, or P8. The transfectants uniformly reacted with tetramer containing the P1-substituted peptide but the mean fluorescence intensity was substantially reduced, suggesting that this substitution may reduce affinity for CD94/NKG2A. The increased staining of transfected cells compared with splenic NK cells with tetramer containing the P1-substituted peptide probably can be attributed to the greater level of expression of CD94/NKG2A on the transfectants.",

Qdm does not inhibit lysis mediated by tetramer-negative NK cells that lack expression of CD94/NKG2A. Substantial inhibition was observed with the P1-substituted Qdm variant (Fig. 6). Thus, the P1 substitution had little or no functional consequences despite tetramer staining data suggesting that this substitution may have reduced receptor binding affinity. The Dk leader peptide also inhibited target cell lysis, although the extent of inhibition was somewhat reduced compared with Qdm (Fig. 6). The Val substitution at P3 in the Dk leader is the only known polymorphism in the corresponding leader sequences of murine H-2D and H-2L molecules. Therefore, our results are consistent with the conclusion that functional ligands for CD94/NKG2 can be generated in mice of all haplotypes.

The effect observed with substitutions at P4, P5, or P8 suggests that the receptor may directly contact the side chains of residues in these positions, consistent with a binding interface that may overlap that used for recognition by T cell antigen receptors. This contrasts with the interaction sites recently defined by the crystal structure of the Ly49A NK inhibitory receptor bound to H-2Dd\n52. Two sites were identified that are spatially distinct from the T cell receptor binding site, explaining the previous observation that Ly49A recognizes MHC class I\u2013peptide complexes independent of peptide composition 53. There is some evidence, however, that Ly49C and Ly49I may have some degree of peptide selectivity 54\n55\n56 The extent to which CD94/NKG2A can discriminate between peptides with chemically conservative substitutions at anchor or solvent-exposed positions remains to be determined. Substitution of smaller nonpolar residues at P4 or P8 with positively charged Lys represents a relatively substantial change in local surface chemistry. In addition, replacement of Pro at P4 may have a significant effect because of the loss of the conformational constraint uniquely associated with Pro. However, a conservative Arg to Lys substitution at P5 also abrogates receptor binding and function. The P5 position may play a particularly important role in receptor recognition.",

Llano et al. reported that a leader peptide from HLA-Cw7 with Ala instead of Thr at P6 was unable to inhibit NK killing despite good binding to HLA-E as measured by stabilization of HLA-E in TAP-deficient 721.221 cells 35. Polymorphisms in human leader peptide residues P1 (Val, Ile), P7 (Leu, Val), and P8 (Leu, Ile, Val, and Phe) did not affect inhibitory activity, consistent with previous results 27\n28\n29\n35. Evidence was also provided suggesting that the HLA-G leader peptide, containing Phe at P8, may be preferentially recognized by the activating receptor CD94/NKG2C compared with other leader peptides 35. Brooks et al. reported that receptor binding was reduced with HLA-E complexes containing the Cw7 leader with Ala at P6 36. In contrast to the results of Llanno et al. 35, this peptide was observed to inhibit NK killing, but only if included in culture throughout the assay 36. It is possible that HLA-E complexes containing the Cw7 leader peptide may be relatively unstable, explaining the apparent discrepancy. An EBV peptide that had previously been shown to bind HLA-E 57 was unable to form a ligand for soluble CD94/NKG2A, nor did it inhibit killing by NK cells 36. Vales-Gomez et al. demonstrated peptide-dependent differences in the binding kinetics of soluble HLA-E to soluble CD94/NKG2A and CD94/NKG2C 37. For both receptors, the highest affinity interactions were observed with HLA-E containing the leader peptide from HLA-G (Phe at P8). Differences in the binding affinities of a panel of HLA-E complexes containing leader peptides with sequence variation in P2, P3, P6, or P8 further demonstrated specificity for bound peptide 37. Together, the above studies suggest that the human CD94/NKG2 receptors can discriminate between HLA-E complexes containing different leader peptides.

Viral proteins that inhibit components of the class I antigen processing pathway to evade recognition by CD8+ T cells 58 could make an infected cell sensitive to lysis by NK cells if the supply of either Qa-1 or Qdm were also disrupted. Inhibition of TAP activity may not inhibit cell surface expression of the Qa-1 protein 23 but it would certainly inhibit expression of the Qa-1\u2013Qdm complexes 11 required for recognition by inhibitory receptors. To avoid NK recognition, it would be necessary for a virus to provide an alternative peptide capable of binding Qa-1, loaded through a TAP-independent mechanism and mimicking the primary structure of Qdm for recognition by CD94/NKG2A. Just such a mechanism has recently been described by Tomasec et al., who reported that expression of the human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein UL40 can upregulate expression of HLA-E in TAP-deficient cells and protect targets from NK lysis 59. UL40 contains a sequence in its signal peptide exactly identical to a nonameric human HLA-C leader peptide known to bind HLA-E. Murine hepatitis virus E3 glycoprotein contains a sequence identical to Qdm in its leader peptide 60. It is possible that this virus has developed a similar mechanism for escape from NK recognition during coevolution with its murine hosts. Given evidence presented here that Qa-1 has a capacity to bind a relatively diverse repertoire of peptides, it is interesting to speculate that virus-encoded peptides could compete with Qdm for binding to Qa-1 in infected cells without generating an appropriate ligand for CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors. This could provide a novel mechanism for NK cell activation.",
