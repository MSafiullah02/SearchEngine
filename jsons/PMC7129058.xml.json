            "text": "Immunofluorescence assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and viral isolation techniques are routinely used to detect adenoviruses (Ad) associated with respiratory infections. However, Ad can take several days to grow in cell culture conditions and are susceptible to specimen toxicity or to be out-competed by bacteria or fungi. Ad isolates can be identified to the species level by the haemagglutination inhibition test and the neutralisation tests (Hierholzer, 1995). The limitations of the neutralisation test are the need for the availability of type-specific antisera and the need to test multiple antisera against a single isolate. For that reason most laboratories choose to limit the test to the Ad that are most frequently isolated from patients with respiratory tract diseases: Ad serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6 from species C, Ad serotypes 3, 7 from species B1, and Ad serotype 4 from species E (Schmidtz et al., 1983) according to the recently amended classification system (Benk\u00f6 et al., 1999) (formerly subgenera). However, other Ad serotypes are occasionally detected in respiratory infections, especially in immunocompromised patients (Hierholzer, 1992). The use of IFA and ELISA to detect antigens provides a rapid diagnosis, but requires significant levels of antigens for detection, and is generally less sensitive than the culture method. The value of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of Ad infections has recently been assessed. Most of the PCR assays used rely on the detection of sequences in the hexon gene region (Allard et al., 1990, Hierholzer et al., 1993, Morris et al., 1996, Raty et al., 1999), whereas others use sequences in theVA RNA gene (Kidd et al., 1996), the pIX gene (Akalu et al., 1998) or in the fiber gene (Xu et al., 2000). Non-nested and nested PCRs have also been developed for the detection of the six species of Ad. These methods are based on the comparison of the migration of amplimers (Kidd et al., 1996), the analysis of restriction enzyme profiles (Elnifro et al., 2000) and the use of multiplex PCR (Na et al., 2002, Pring-Akerblom et al., 1999, Xu et al., 2000). Finally, a method based on a combination of PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion has been developed for the rapid identification of species and serotypes of Ad (Allard et al., 2001).",

Two Ad group-specific primers were designed according to the reported sequences of the VA RNA gene between positions 10,065 and 10,235 for the Ad 40 sequence and between positions 10,607 and 11,023 for the Ad 2 sequence. DNA was amplified in a 50 \u03bcl volumes containing 5 \u03bcl of DNA and 45 \u03bcl of reaction mixture (1\u00d7 PCR buffer, 200 \u03bcM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.4 mM each primer, 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase [HotStarTaq, Qiagen, France]). The amplification conditions were as follows: (i) initial denaturation for 15 min at 95 \u00b0C to activate the enzyme, followed by: (ii) 10 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 10 s, touch down annealing temperature from 65 to 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, then 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C, for 10 s; 55 \u00b0C, for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C, for 30 s and (iii) a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. Amplified products were analysed by hybridisation on microtiter plates with biotinylated probes. Hybrids were detected with a streptavidin peroxidase conjugate. A tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide solution was used as a substrate for color development (Hybridowell\u2122, Arg\u00e8ne, France). Adenovirus Consensus\u00ae kit, is now commercialy available (Argene, ref 67-065). One generic probe characterizing the Ad group and seven specific probes corresponding to Ad A, Ad B1, Ad B2, Ad C, Ad D, Ad E, Ad F are provided in the kit. However, an internal control, a composite plasmid containing sequences recognized by the primers flanking a plasmidic sequence, with thermodynamics similar to those of the viral sequence has been added to follow the inhibition of the amplification. This control is hybridized with a specific probe. A negative control of the amplification is performed for each experience with the premix amplication using sterile water. A negative detection control, human amplified product, is provided in order to determine the cut-off value. After detection of the positive samples with the generic probe, the species of the virus involved is determined using the specific probes on the same amplified product.(iii)\nPCR Ad hexon: We used the two hexon gene primers described by Hierholzer et al. (1993) (positions 2728\u20132750 and 2888\u20132866), and a 5\u2032-biotinylated probe B (positions 2833\u20132858). The PCR and the detection of the amplified products by agarose gel electrophoresis (band at 161 bp) and by a DNA Enzyme Immunoassay (GEN-ETI-K\u00ae DEIA, Sorin, France) were carried out as previously reported (Freymuth et al., 1997).(iv)\nSerotyping: The results obtained with PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00ae were compared with those obtained with the neutralisation test and the test described by Allard et al. (2001) using PCR to amplify sequences in the hexon gene combined with restriction endonuclease analysis with the aim of identifying serotypes that were identified by all three methods.\n",

The seven species had been correctly amplified, and the expected sizes of the bands, corresponding to one VA RNA gene (Ad from species A, B2, F) or to two VA RNA genes (Ad from B1, C, D, E), was as follows:: Ad 12 (sp A): 306 bp, Ad 7 (Sp B1): 584 bp, Ad 11 (sp B2): 354 bp, Ad 1 (sp C): 601 bp, Ad 8 (sp D): 520 bp, Ad 4 (sp E): 548 bp, Ad 40 (sp F): 323 bp (Fig. 1\n). However, as large bands (>500 bp) migrate slowly, Ad species B1, C, D and E cannot be reliably differentiated on this basis, thus species-specific probes were also designed as shown below.",

The analytical sensitivity of PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00ae was further delineated by testing the DNA extracted from serial dilutions of MRC-5-infected cells. We used Ad prototype strains belonging to the main species and representative of those isolated from patients with respiratory Ad infections: Ad 12 (sp A), Ad 3 and Ad 7 (sp B1), Ad 11 (sp B2), Ad 1 (sp C), Ad 8 (sp D), Ad 4 (sp E). The numbers of genome equivalents per ml (GE/ml) were calculated using the end point dilution method and were compared to the 50% infectious dose per ml (ID50/ml) for each strain (Table 1\n). The mean GE/ml and ID50/ml for the seven serotypes, were 106.3 and 104, respectively. The large difference between the titres of the Ad strains according to their ID/ml or GE/ml, is probably to be due to the fact that MRC cells are not the best culture system for the isolation of Ad and that higher GE values reflects the proportion of nonviable virus unable to initiate productive infection. As usual, the result was slightly higher with the hybridisation method than with the gel electrophoresis method (mean titres of Ad strains: 106.2versus 105, respectively). However, the titres obtained after hybridisation in the PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00ae technique did not differ according to whether the consensus probe or the sugbroup-specific probes were used.",

The technique described by Allard et al. (1990) amplifies a 308 bp fragment partially located in the P1 domain of the hexon gene. In comparison with the culture method, the sensitivity of the Allard method was 93% for species C (types 1, 2, 5, 6) and only 50% for Ad 3 and Ad 7 belonging to B1 species, which are particularly involved in the respiratory diseases (Morris et al., 1996). Hierholzer et al. (1993) described a PCR method, which amplifies a 161 bp fragment located in the P2 region of the hexon gene associated with hybridisation to a fluorescent probe. In a study on 103 samples including 68 respiratory samples, the same number of positive samples were obtained with the culture method, the direct IF method and with the new PCR method. The PCR detection of Ad sequences may not reflect an active viral infection because some Ad (especially Ad 1, 2, 5, 6 from species C) can induce a latent infection. Some authors have suggested combining a PCR method with in situ hybridisation for positive samples (Matsuse et al., 1994). Raty et al. (1999) compared techniques for the detection of Ad on 268 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from soldiers affected by acute respiratory infections. According to the culture method, 59.1% of the samples were Ad positive compared to 31.9% for the antigen detection method and 62.9% for the PCR method using a crude isolate extracted by \u201cboiling.\u201d In this PCR method, the primers were located in the hexon gene (Allard et al., 1990) and an internal control was included for each sample, to avoid false negative results. Two samples (0.7%) were shown to contain inhibitors. Compared to the culture method, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR method were 94% and 85%, respectively; 15 samples were positive according to the culture method and negative according to the PCR method. In our study on 362 nasal aspirates, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR methods were higher: 97.9% and 93.2% respectively for the Adenovirus Consensus\u00ae PCR, and higher: 96.9% and 95% for the PCR hexon method. Eighteen samples were positive according to the Adenovirus Consensus\u00ae PCR and negative according to the IF and culture methods. These cannot be false positives due to contamination because: (i) 13 were confirmed as positive with a second PCR method and (ii) the five others were confirmed on a second extract. These samples probably contained a low viral yield, below the detection limits of the IF and culture methods. Alternatively, these Ad strains may have been uncultivable or virtually uncultivable (Hierholzer, 1992). Finally, the Ad Consensus\u00ae PCR, method appeared to be more sensitive than the hexon PCR method with the screening probe, and was even more convenient following the introduction of an internal control for each sample, which reduced the number of false negative results by displaying inhibitors.",

These techniques are time-consuming and are not suitable for clinical diagnosis. Kidd et al. (1996) proposed a one-step PCR method able to screen and to identify Ad species associated with the study of the enzymatic restriction profile (Kidd et al., 1996). The size of the amplified fragment varies in the different species and according to the number of copies of the VA RNA gene. Indeed, the A, B2 and F species, have one copy of the VA RNA gene, whereas the B1, C, D and E species have two copies, leading to 240\u2013290 bp amplified fragments for the first group and 490\u2013520 bp fragments for the second. To discriminate between members of each group (A, B2, F and B1, C, D, E) they analysed the enzymatic restriction profiles of the amplified products. On 200 Ad culture isolates, only 3% of the results were discordant with the seroneutralisation results. Our PCR, AdV Consensus\u00ae method, uses different primers to Kidd et al. (1996), located in the same VA RNA region, and specific probes to identify each Ad species. Seventy-six of the species identified by culture seroneutralisation were confirmed by the AdV Consensus\u00ae method. In addition, six Ad detected by direct IF and not isolated by culture were identified as being B1 and C species, and six others, negative according to IF and culture, were detected and identified as being B1, C, and F species.",

The technique described by Allard et al. (2001), using degenerate primers in the conserved hexon region followed by restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified product, can identify the Ad species and the serotype of the most Ad involved in disease. This method gave good results on 51 Ad prototype strains and 44 variant strains. Thirty-four of the 40 clinical samples (including eight respiratory samples) were positive according to both the PCR and the culture methods. Six were not amplified and had to be further tested by nested PCR, but the amplimer was too short to be analysed by restriction endonucleases. We compared this identification technique with the conventional seroneutralisation technique and the AdV Consensus\u00ae technique on the 160 nasal aspirates of our study. Five of the 91 Ad strains, amplified and identified by the AdV Consensus\u00ae technique, were not detected by the Allard method: one Ad 3 and two Ad sp B1 (not detected by culture), one Ad sp C and one Ad sp F (not detected by culture).",

It is more efficient than the classical IF or culture techniques. It consists of one-step PCR followed by hybridisation. An internal control is included to validate the screening results, and specific probes are used to identify the Ad species. This technique is easier and quicker than the enzymatic digestion methods described in the literature, which have not generally been evaluated on clinical samples.",
