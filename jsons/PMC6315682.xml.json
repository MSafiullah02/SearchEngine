            "text": "Mammalian orthoreoviruses, hereafter referred to as reovirus, are members of the Reoviridae family, a large family of viruses that have three major characteristics in common. Firstly, their genome is made of a certain number of double-stranded RNA segments. Secondly, they all possess a naked capsid made of concentric protein layers. Finally, the genome of these viruses is never completely released but rather transcribed by viral enzymes retained inside a viral particle in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Mammalian orthoreoviruses have been instrumental in understanding various aspects of Reoviridae replication, although the last decade has seen considerable progress in the understanding of other family members. Some of this work, especially on rotaviruses and orbiviruses, will occasionally be referred to when equivalent data are not available for reovirus.",

            "text": "Despite recent accumulating evidence of transmission to humans or domestic animals of new pathogenic strains [1,2,3], reovirus is generally believed to be almost not pathogenic in humans. Nevertheless, they have been extensively used as a model system by prominent figures of late 20th century virology as Bernard Fields, William Joklik and Aaron Shatkin to name just a few. In the last two decades, these viruses have again attracted the attention of the scientific community since they are among the few naturally oncolytic viruses currently under clinical trials [4,5] and they have been recognized as orphan drugs by the American Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat some forms of cancers (e.g., gastric, pancreatic, peritoneal, ovarian). More recently, they have been used once again as a model system to support the idea that viruses could contribute to breaking of tolerance to food antigens such as gluten. This could lead to celiac disease and largely asymptomatic reovirus infection appears to be clinically correlated with the disease [6].",

Each viral gene in mammalian orthoreoviruses harbors identical GCUA sequence at the 5\u2032-end and UCAUC at the 3\u2032-end; other related viruses such as pteropine reovirus also harbor conserved sequences that may however differ. The viral genome and resulting mRNA is not polyadenylated but the plus strand of the viral genome, and at least part of the viral mRNA, harbors a cap structure; this will be further discussed below. The viral capsid is made of 8 proteins while 4 nonstructural proteins are made during the viral replication cycle. The capsid proteins are assembled as an outer capsid and an inner capsid or core; turrets present at the 12 vertices of the capsid structure are made of a single viral protein assembled as homopentamers and serve as anchors for the viral cell-attachment homotrimeric protein [8].",

            "text": "Briefly, following host-cell binding to different cellular receptors (e.g., sialic acids, GM2 ganglioside, JAM-I, Ngo-R, B-integrins), the reovirus virions are internalized by clathrin, or possibly caveolin-based, endocytosis. Following endocytosis, stepwise proteolytic digestion of the outer capsid leads to acquisition of a membrane-penetrating ability to cross the late endosomal membrane. Alternatively, partially uncoated particles, known as infectious subviral particles (ISVPs), can bypass endocytosis and gain access to the cell\u2019s interior directly through the plasma membrane. The remaining outer capsid proteins will be eliminated either during or after translocation to the host-cell cytoplasm, to generate the transcriptionally active core structure. The uncoating efficiency by the combined effect of lysosomal enzymes and autocleavage by the outer viral capsid \u03bc1 will thus contribute to the efficiency of transcription initiation. In addition, a cellular chaperone is apparently involved in the later steps of uncoating [10]. Cleavage products of the remaining outer capsid proteins are finally released, and the viral cell attachment protein (\u03c31) is removed from the \u03bb2 pentameric channel, opening it for viral mRNA extrusion while transcription occurs. The presence of the \u03c33 and \u03bc1 heterohexamer forming the outer capsid is sufficient to inhibit the transcription of full-length mRNA molecules [11]. However, a recent report also suggests that the amount of \u03c31 protein, or efficiency of its release from the virion, could be a limiting factor to viral mRNA export from the transcriptionally active particle [12]. Interestingly, various reports indicate that different viral isolates can harbor different amounts of \u03c31 spikes [12,13,14,15,16], while an earlier report even suggested that as few as three copies of the trimers are sufficient for normal infectivity on fibroblasts in tissue culture [17]. There is thus probably a balance between the amount of \u03c31 required for optimal infectivity and that required for its most efficient removal allowing synthesis and release of viral mRNA. ",

Essentially, these studies relied on different approaches of in vitro characterization using proteins recovered from various expression systems. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with the structural analysis of proteins by X-ray crystallography has also increased our knowledge of viral particles structure [18]). But it is only as recently as 2007, that a T7 plasmid-based reverse genetics technique finally allowed to alter with relative ease the genome of reovirus and thus study the effect of predetermined changes on the viral multiplication cycle [19,20,21]. More recently, high-throughput approaches have also been used to extensively look at the effect of reovirus infection on either the cellular proteome [22,23,24,25] or transcriptome using microarrays [26,27,28,29,30,31] or more extensive RNA-seq approaches [32,33].

Viral mRNA is then released from the cores through the turrets, giving rise to impressive images in electron microscopy [34]. The \u03bb3 protein had already been identified as the viral polymerase in the 1980s, using gene reassortment to identify the gene responsible for the pH optimum of transcription [35]. Biochemical and ultrastructural studies have confirmed beyond doubt that this protein is responsible for the transcription of the viral dsRNA genome [36,37,38]. Detailed discussion of the structure of the RNA polymerase can be found in an excellent book chapter [39] and is clearly outside the scope of the present review. However, it should be mentioned that the protein harbors a consensus GDD motif and general thumb, palm, and priming loop structures common to many viral RNA polymerases, as also recently reviewed [40,41]. The reovirus polymerase does not need a primer per se to initiate de novo RNA synthesis but conserved sequences present at the end of the viral genome are likely required for recognition prior to initiation of polymerization; the second conserved nucleotide on the template strand is especially important to recruit the polymerase allowing initiation of mRNA synthesis from the priming nucleotide. Approximately 12 copies of \u03bb3 per virion are present under the inner capsid close to the base of each turret. Ultrastructural evidence indicates that the newly synthesized mRNAs cross the outer capsid protein layer through a channel at the interface of two \u03bb1 subunits, then through the channel in the middle of the \u03bb2 pentamer [38]. The minus strand of the double-stranded RNA enters the \u03bb3 polymerase through a first channel in the enzyme structure and exit through a second channel; the mRNA synthesized and the nucleotides enter through two other channels in the enzyme structure. The 5\u2032-cap structure on the plus strand of the double-stranded RNA is tethered to \u03bb3 and this is believed to be important for the initiation of the transcription. As for most viruses, the nucleic acid concentration inside the viral particle is high, most recent estimates suggest the concentration to be as high as 400 mg/mL [42]. In Reoviridae, however, the viral genome remains in the viral particle\u2019s interior where high viscosity conditions are present thus likely limiting movement of transcriptional complex but still allowing RNA movement [43]. The currently accepted model is sometimes referred to as a \u201cfixed-polymerase-moving-template\u201d situation. In different dsRNA viruses, there is evidence that the RNA is well ordered inside the capsid and it is likely that each genomic segment is associated with a single transcription complex [44,45,46,47,48] and currently available data indicate that it is also likely to be the case in reovirus [36]. Interestingly, in the non-turreted rotavirus, transcription of each gene was recently shown to be specifically associated with one transcription complex and release of each corresponding transcript was shown to occur through one given channel of the transcribing particle [49]; hopefully, similar experiments will be performed for other members of the Reoviridae, such as mammalian reovirus, in the near future.",

Ample evidence suggests that relatively long sequences are required for adequate function of the viral genomic segments and/or mRNA [51,52,53,54,55]; some of these, however, are rather required for packaging or synthesis of the negative strand of the RNA genome, these aspects will not be further discussed herein.",

RNA polymerases do not possess proofreading ability hence the high mutation rate of RNA viruses that may limit their size to allow maintenance of viable genomes through time. Interestingly, coronaviruses were recently shown to possess such an activity; although the required exonuclease activity is encoded by a protein distinct from the polymerase itself [56]. There is no evidence that reovirus possesses such a proofreading ability although this could certainly deserve further study. The replication strategy where the genome is repeatedly used to generate the first strand of new genomes, avoiding a classical semi-conservative strategy, is also a factor that should significantly reduce accumulation of replication errors. To our knowledge there has been no precise measurement of mutation rates in reoviruses, although in the dsRNA phage phi6 (\u03d56), frequency of nucleotide substitution appears lower than in other RNA viruses [57]. However the \u03d56 replication strategy is slightly different by release of the plus strand of the viral genome rather than its de novo synthesis [58]; its genome is also much smaller, making comparisons difficult.",

Interestingly, crystal structure of rotavirus polymerase does also show a cap-binding site [59] while the bluetongue virus polymerase does show a cap dependency [60], at least for copying of a single-stranded RNA template in vitro. This suggests that these polymerases all use a cap structure to ensure template binding and/or unwinding. Although the reovirus polymerase was shown to possess a polymerizing activity by itself in vitro, it appears to be limited and unable to actually transcribe dsRNA [61]. It is unclear if this is solely due to inappropriate experimental conditions or to the actual necessity of other viral proteins for a full ability to transcribe the viral genome. Two viral core proteins, \u03bc2 and \u03bb1, harbor consensus motifs consistent with a helicase activity, as well as expected affinity for nucleic acids.",

The position of the catalytic sequences in the N-terminal region intracapsidic portion of the protein, a region that is dispensable for core assembly [70] is, however, consistent with a possible role as a helicase. The structure of this part of the protein appears to be disorganized and possibly cleaved during the capsid reorganization that leads to transcriptional activation of the core particle [36,43,71]; this was interpreted as either precluding or suggesting its role in transcription. For now, no published study has clearly established or ruled out the importance of the catalytic region of \u03bb1 for the synthesis of viral RNA in the context of a viral infection. Recent data showing that \u03bb1 can contribute to the control of interferon induction [72] suggest additional role(s) for the well-known affinity of the protein for nucleic acid [73,74] and/or for its enzymatic activity.",

This is consistent with the idea that each dsRNA segment in the viral capsid is transcribed by a given molecule of RNA polymerase acting at the same speed on the template, as previously mentioned for the recent work on rotavirus [49]. Other earlier reports indicating that the ratio of the ten reovirus mRNAs in the infected cells differs from those obtained in vitro are difficult to reconcile with such a model and the mechanism involved, if any, remains unclear. It will be of interest to clarify this point using modern approaches for precise RNA quantitation, such as quantitative RT-PCR or RNA-seq analysis. Another aspect that remains unexplained is the previously discussed observations [50] showing that only four viral genes are transcribed at very early times post-infection, and that protein synthesis is required to relieve this apparent blockage of transcription on the six remaining genes. In the absence of additional data, it is difficult to assess if this transcriptional regulation actually takes place considering the technical challenges of the hybridization methods used to measure the different viral transcripts at the time.",

Again, both \u03bc2 and \u03bb1 exhibit such an activity in vitro [75,76] with very similar enzymatic parameters. In both cases, the affinity for the substrate as measured by the Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics was shown to be 10-fold better for 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA than for free nucleotides.

Furthermore, to our knowledge, similar experiments have not been performed yet with \u03bb1. At this point, there is thus no direct evidence to clearly assign the RNA triphosphatase activity to either of these proteins. Recent structural data on cypoviruses and aquareoviruses, other turreted dsRNA viruses of the Reoviridae family, indicated that the analog of \u03bc2 is positioned inside the core at the basis of the turret and in interaction with the viral polymerase. However, its position precludes an interaction with the 5\u2032-end of the nascent viral mRNA and this appears to rule out the possibility that it acts as the RNA triphosphatase [48,79]. To our knowledge, similar data are not yet available for reovirus.",

            "text": "In contrast, the guanylyltransferase forming the 5\u2032-5 triphosphate link between the first nucleotide and a GDP molecule from GTP, in the second step of cap synthesis, has been known for more than 25 years. The core-associated \u03bb2 turret protein possesses this activity by itself [80,81,82]. Following the formation of this link, the so-called cap 0 structure is formed by the addition of a methyl at position N-7 of the transferred GMP. Addition of a 2\u2032-O on the first nucleotide of the mRNA itself then forms the cap 1 structure. Both methyltransferase activities are also clearly associated with \u03bb2 and correspond to the regions around amino acids 420\u2013720 and 800\u20131030 approximately; however, there is still a controversy concerning the role of each region in forming the cap 0 and cap 1 structure by adding the corresponding methyl group. The position of the two methyltransferase domains has led to suggest that separate molecules of the \u03bb2 turrets are involved in the consecutive addition of the two methyl groups [36]. This idea is consistent with the guanylyltransferase activity observed with purified \u03bb2 while methyltransferase is not [81], suggesting that formation of a higher-order complex is necessary for this latter activity. It was also postulated that the order of the three domains on the protein reflects the order of the reactions, the last methyltransferase domain being responsible for the 2\u2032-O methylation forming cap 1 structure [36]. However, detailed sequence homology and structure analysis have rather led other investigators to propose that the order is in fact the opposite, the most amino-terminal domain being rather responsible for the 2\u2032-O methylation [83]. Interestingly, recent crystallographic data of a cypovirus, another member of the Reoviridae harboring a turret similar to that of reovirus, revealed a similar organization where the 2\u2032-O methyltransferase is believed to be located after the N7-methyltransferase on the linear structure of the protein [84]. These data are in agreement with a model where the RNA travels to be in contact with a least two, and possibly three, molecules of the capping enzyme [38]. Our recent work [85], showing that an amino acid substitution in the first methyltransferase domain leads to increased interferon sensitivity of the virus supports this idea. Increased induction and/or sensitivity to interferon have previously been assigned to an impaired 2\u2032-O methylation for different viruses [86,87,88]. Engineering of mutant viruses harboring amino acids substitutions in either methyltransferase domain could help to clarify which domain is actually responsible for each step of methyl addition to the cap structure.",

This has been reviewed in the past but evidence remains limited [89,90]. If a proportion of reovirus mRNA is actually harboring a cap 2 structure, a cellular activity must be involved in the addition of this third methyl group. The recent discoveries of cytoplasmic capping activities, and especially the cytoplasmic presence of the cellular methyltransferase involved in cap 2 formation [91,92,93,94], does support this possibility. Interestingly, it has been observed that the presence of interferon could preclude the synthesis of this cap 2 structure although, this does not seem to have been further established since these early reports [95,96]. An effect of interferon on relative amount of methyl donor to methyl acceptor molecules (S-adenosylhomocysteine to S-adenosylmethionine) has also been reported [97]. Clearly, it will be of interest to re-examine the effect of interferon on cellular and viral mRNA capping and on the presence or intracellular distribution of the cellular enzymes involved.",

            "text": "The work carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart Millward at McGill University in the 1980s suggested that a transition in the nature of the viral mRNA 5\u2032-terminal end occurs during infection. Messenger RNA transcribed by parental virus particles are capped while in progeny particles the enzymatic activities responsible for cap synthesis appear to be either absent, inactive or masked [98,99,100]. There have been reports of a transient lack of the \u03bb2 turrets on the progeny particles, as previously discussed [50,89,90]. Although later observations failed to support this presence of particles devoid of \u03bb2 in a wild-type virus, they nevertheless indicated that viral cores can be assembled without the turret in a thermosensitive mutant [101]. Also, the initial suggestion that capping enzymes were masked by the presence of nonstructural inclusion protein \u03bcNS on the particles [89] was not supported by further studies showing that this does not actually interfere with the capping activities [102]. The mechanism behind the apparent \u201cmasking\u201d of capping activity thus remains elusive; the development of new powerful ultrastructural imaging techniques could allow to clarify the exact structure of the viral particles at different times during the multiplication cycle, in order to answer this question. It should also be mentioned that the RNA synthesized from viral particles in vitro, harbors a diphosphate end, when produced under conditions favoring RNA production without the cap structure. This is achieved in absence of the methyl donor (SAM) and in the presence of the methyl acceptor (SAH) to prevent the methylation of the cap structure. The reversal of the guanylylation reaction of these unmethylated cap structure is also favored by adding an excess of the reaction product (sodium pyrophosphate) to the reaction. In contrast, the late viral RNA extracted from infected cells exhibits a monophosphate 5\u2032-end, suggesting action of a phosphatase, viral or cellular, a point that has never been further examined. We still do not know the nature of the factor(s) involved, if any. Avoiding the presence of a diphosphorylated 5\u2032-end is a strategy used by other viruses to prevent activation of antiviral program of the innate immune response in infected cells, through recognition by RIG-I or by IFIT1 (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I or Interferon Induced Protein with Tetratricopeptide Repeats 1) [103,104,105,106,107]. The importance of the innate immune response in the control of protein synthesis will be further discussed in Section 7.4. Strikingly, a study published in 2013 [108] suggests the presence of a proportion of uncapped rotavirus mRNA late in infection that is recognized by the innate immune system. This again suggests that capping of rotavirus or reovirus mRNAs is probably incomplete, at best, and this could play an important role in the ability of the innate immune system to recognize and control the infection.",

Its significance remains difficult to assess since decreased transcription was observed concomitantly with decreased protein synthesis and only for serotype 2. The fact that reovirus is a cytoplasmic RNA virus harboring all its transcriptional/capping machinery could lead to the impression that it should not affect nuclear processes. However, there is accumulating evidence of cytoplasmic RNA viruses that either take advantage of, or affect nuclear processes [110,111,112,113]. For example, in rotavirus, sequestration of the poly(A) binding protein to the nucleus is believed to contribute to decreased levels of cellular mRNA available for translation in the cytoplasm [114,115] but, to our knowledge, this has never been examined for reovirus.",

Although the \u03c3 proteins are probably small enough to be partly located to the nucleus by diffusion, other reovirus proteins will require a nuclear localization signal. Interestingly, \u03bc2 and \u03bb3 are predicted to harbor such a signal. Our recent work, using mass spectrometry, allowed to confirm a strong nuclear enrichment of \u03bc2, and a significant enrichment of the viral RNA polymerase \u03bb3 [32]. The role of nuclear \u03bb3, if its nuclear presence is confirmed, remains undetermined but, interestingly, it was recently observed by us and others that reovirus infection significantly affect the pattern of alternative splicing of a certain number of cellular pre-mRNA [32,33]. Although \u03bc2 appears to be at least partly involved [33], a possible involvement of \u03bb3 will be somewhat reminiscent of the poliovirus polymerase that was also found in the nucleus and shown to alter the splicing machinery of the infected cells [121]. A better understanding of alternative splicing in reovirus biology appears as a whole new research avenue to be explored.",

Although it has been suggested that the \u03bc2 protein is rather synthesized from the second AUG codon on the messenger RNA [125], this was thereafter clearly ruled out [126,127]. In mammalian orthoreoviruses, each viral gene also encodes only one primary translation product except for S1 and M3. The s1 mRNA encodes both \u03c31 and a second small nonstructural protein (\u03c31s) in a second reading frame bypassing the first initiation codon (Figure 3), as well established by numerous studies [128,129,130]. Interestingly, this was among the first mRNA known to be translated on an alternative open reading frame in eukaryotic cells. This strategy is now known to be relatively frequent on viral mRNA, and recently shown to be potentially more frequent than expected on cellular mRNAs [131]. The m3 mRNA encodes both \u03bcNS and a second shorter form (\u03bcNSC) by initiating translation at a second in-frame initiation codon [132,133] (Figure 3). To date, there is no evidence that alternative open reading frames are used on other mammalian reovirus mRNAs; only one downstream open reading frames beginning with AUG can potentially encode a peptide longer than 100 amino acids and the surrounding context does not correspond to a favored Kozak\u2019s consensus sequence, making it unlikely that it is actually used. However, it is not possible to completely exclude that other mechanisms could allow alternative initiation. In fact, other orthoreoviruses, such as avian or reptilian reoviruses, were shown to encode up to three different polypeptides on the same mRNA while the alternative translational initiation mechanisms used remain incompletely understood [134,135].",

In contrast, as previously mentioned, reovirus mRNAs, as all mRNA of viruses from the Reoviridae family, are not polyadenylated at their 3\u2032-end. In vitro translation studies have established that reovirus mRNA translation is not sensitive to inhibition by free poly(A) nor stimulated by addition a poly(A) tract at their 3\u2032-end [140]. This indicates that they are not dependent on poly(A) binding protein. In rotavirus, despite some controversies, most recent evidence support the idea that a nonstructural viral protein somehow substitute for cellular poly(A)-binding proteins [141,142].

More than 30 years ago, the reovirus protein \u03c33 was shown to stimulate translation of viral mRNAs, but only those devoid of a cap structure. This protein behaves more or less like a translation initiation factor and was found associated with ribosomes [140,143]. Additional work indicated that the protein is released by high-salt treatment known to release initiation factors, but not by treatment that will separate the two ribosomal subunits (EDTA) or remove the mRNA template from the ribosomes (micrococcal nuclease) [144]. Furthermore, using in vitro translation system, there were indications that the protein is released from the ribosomes under conditions in which initiation of translation is blocked, while it accumulates on the ribosome when initiation is allowed but elongation is prevented [144]. Similar reports of viral proteins apparently acting as initiation factors of protein synthesis have been reported in the last ten years for RNA and DNA viruses belonging to diverse virus families [137,145,146], including bluetongue virus as another Reoviridae [147]. Interestingly, a recent study revealed that the translation of uncapped infectious bursal disease virus RNA, another dsRNA virus of the Birnaviridae family, relies on the presence of a viral protein that may act as a substitute for the translation initiation factor eIF4E [148]. This suggests that the use of a viral protein to stimulate viral uncapped mRNA translation could be a mechanism shared by different dsRNA viruses.",

The ability of the protein to bind dsRNA does appear as a prerequisite for this nuclear presence [116]. However, despite the presence of a putative nucleolar localization signal, this should be viewed with caution in the absence of more direct evidence in infected cells. Overall, this should be further examined in the context of viral infection, at different times post-infection, as the importance of the nucleolus in the multiplication of various viruses has now been established [149,150,151,152,153].

This could allow to secure translation of viral proteins at the site of viral mRNA synthesis and viral assembly, and could contribute to shielding viral nucleic acids from recognition by the innate immune system. Surprisingly, other studies do not indicate the presence of ribosomes in the inclusions [159]. Overall, it appears that clarification of the involvement of the viral inclusion during reovirus mRNA translation will require further investigation.",

            "text": "Upon infection of the classically used L929 mouse fibroblasts in culture, a significant decrease is observed in synthesis of cellular protein, this inhibition being variable among viral strains [109,160]. There has been a controversy in the literature concerning the possibility that reovirus mRNA and cellular mRNA are in competition for a limiting factor in the infected cells. This was postulated to be cause for inhibition of host-cell mRNA translation, due to excess viral mRNA [161,162]. This hypothesis has been previously discussed in greater details [50] and various arguments against this possibility have been presented over the years [163,164,165]. In contrast, a series of experiments suggested that late reovirus-infected cells present a decreased ability to support cap-dependent translation of either cellular or viral mRNA [100,163,166,167]. The exact alterations of cap-binding proteins in reovirus-infected cells remain to be more firmly established. It was observed that the addition of a monoclonal antibody directed against the 24 kDa eIF4E cap-binding protein has no effect on translation in cell-free extract prepared from infected cells, in contrast to the inhibition of cap-dependent translation in uninfected cells [168]. This supports the idea of an altered function of cap-binding proteins upon reovirus infection. A decreased amount of crosslinking to radiolabeled cap structure was also observed for a certain number of proteins in infected cells [167]; however, it does not seem that the phosphorylation of eIF4E is altered, in contrast to the situation observed in inhibition of cap-dependent translation in cells infected with members of the Picornaviridae [169]. Clearly, this should be further investigated now that specific reagents and approaches such as specific antibodies for immunoblotting, RNA interference, gene knockout and mass spectrometry are available to examine more closely each component of the translational machinery. Also, there is clearly a functional difference between uncapped-diphosphorylated reovirus RNA (ppG-terminated) synthesized in vitro and in vivo-synthesized monophosphorylated RNA (pG-terminated). While translation of ppG-terminated RNA is resistant to addition of a cap analog translational inhibitor (m7GTP), as expected, pG-terminated RNA was surprisingly found to remain sensitive even in infected cell lysates [163]. This further stresses that earlier competition experiments using in vitro-synthesized RNA should be viewed with caution. It will be interesting to revisit this issue by taking advantage of various chemical inhibitors now available.",

The hypothesis is that the long-known ability of the protein to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) could inhibit the cellular dsRNA-dependent antiviral protein kinase, PKR. The protein kinase PKR is a cellular, interferon-inducible, antiviral protein that requires dsRNA for its dimerization; the protein can then autophosphorylate becoming activated to phosphorylate different substrates, including translational initiation factor eif2\u03b1 resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis [171,172,173]. The importance of PKR in the control of viral infection is supported by the fact that numerous viruses have developed one, or even many, factors to counteract its activity [146,171,174,175]. Not surprisingly, PKR is inhibited in vitro or in transfected cells in the presence of \u03c33, due to competition for dsRNA binding [170,176,177,178]. Reovirus \u03c33 can also substitute for known viral inhibitors of PKR to allow replication of such viruses as adenovirus, vaccinia virus and paramyxovirus [179,180,181,182]. Despite these different observations it remains controversial if PKR is involved, or solely responsible, for inhibition of host-cell protein synthesis during reovirus infection [27,165,183,184,185,186,187].",

Interestingly, a \u03c33 thermosensitive mutant is unable to interact with \u03bc1 at the restrictive temperature and, as a result, exhibits an increased ability to bind dsRNA and decreased susceptibility to interferon [117]. Much work has been devoted to the biochemical mapping of amino-acid motifs involved in dsRNA binding of \u03c33 and two different models, not necessarily mutually exclusive, have emerged [189,190]. In a first one, two basic motifs are found and are both involved although the second one, with a critical lysine, is most important [177,178,191,192]. In a later model, the RNA is proposed to be bound at the basic surface of a \u03c33 homodimer [193,194]. Recent data have actually confirmed the transition from \u03c33 homomultimer to structural \u03c33\u2013\u03bc1 heterohexamer by the action of cellular chaperonin [195].",

This could be followed by activation of the cellular protein kinase, PKR, consecutive to its homodimerization due to presence of viral double-stranded RNA, and inhibition of protein synthesis that could interfere with viral replication. In the case of reovirus, it does not seem that the genomic double-stranded RNA is exposed to the recognition by the innate immune system. The exact structure that is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) remains to be firmly established in the context of a viral infection. It has been clearly shown that diphosphorylated 5\u2032-end present on the minus strand of the viral dsRNA genome is a potent PAMP recognized by RIG-I [197]; however, it is unclear if these will be actually exposed during the viral multiplication cycle. Obviously, if part of the mRNA molecules is devoid of a cap structure, this could also be recognized as non-self-RNA and induces interferon signaling. Extensive folding of some viral mRNA species could also be recognized. Finally, if some viral strains or viral mutants lack the ability to correctly methylate the viral cap structure, to make viral RNA as similar as possible to cellular mRNAs, this could lead to either induction or sensitivity to the antiviral response, as proposed for an interferon-sensitive reovirus mutant [85].",

Further work then indicated that oncogenic Ras can also inhibit interferon induction through negative regulation of RIG-I signaling involved in activation of the interferon response in the presence of viral RNA [198]. The presence of an activated Ras should thus promote replication, propagation and cell-killing activity of the virus in transformed cells. Accordingly, increased sensitivity to interferon of a mutant virus was shown to correlate with increased ability to discriminate between parental and Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells [199]. Since interferon response or signaling is known to be often deficient in cancer cells [200,201], a better understanding of reovirus determinants of induction of the interferon response or viral sensitivity to the induced response could clearly be of importance for a possible optimization of reovirus as an oncolytic virus [202,203].",

This could be reconciled if one considers the multiple roles that PKR plays in the cell, normal or infected [171,173]. Although it is not possible to discuss this point in detail herein, an interesting observation is the fact that PKR can contribute to activation of the p38 pathway. Stimulation of the same pathway was previously shown to be involved in the stimulation of reovirus replication following Ras transformation [204,205].

            "text": "More recently, further progress has been made in understanding the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells since the discovery of so-called \u201cRNA granules\u201d such as stress granules or processing bodies. These granules appear to be principally used by the cell to limit the use of the energy-expensive translational machinery by transiently sequestering RNA to be later translated or degraded. Accordingly, infection by a variety of viruses stimulates or inhibits the formation of these granules and in either case the result could promote or interfere with viral replication [208,209,210]. It has been shown that stress granules are actually formed during reovirus infection [27,211]; to our knowledge there has been no report of processing bodies formation, although this may just have been overlooked in reovirus studies. Later studies suggested that stress granules are formed at an early stage and probably dissociated to allow protein synthesis during the later stages of the infection [185,207]. Interestingly, some viral core and inclusion proteins were found in the stress granules [212] while some stress granules proteins could be trapped later in the inclusions [213]. Overall, this is consistent with a model in which viral mRNA is transiently stored in stress granules until inclusions are formed. This could contribute to avoid recognition by the host cell defense mechanisms, or allow compartmentalization of the synthesis of viral proteins late in infection, if it actually occurs in viral inclusions.",

Upon binding to different host-cell receptors (1), the reovirus virion containing the double-stranded RNA genome (in blue) is internalized by endocytosis (2) and transported towards late endosomes (2); they are then partially disassembled to produce transcriptionally active cores that are released in the host-cell cytoplasm (3). Alternatively, due to the action of extracellular proteases, partially uncoated virions known as infectious subviral particles (ISVPs) are generated (1b) and can bypass endocytosis and penetrate the host-cell membrane (2b) also leading to transcriptionally active cores in the cytoplasm (3). These \u201cparental\u201d cores possess all required enzymatic activities to synthesize and release multiple copies of capped messenger RNA (in black) synthesized from the ten viral double-stranded RNA genome segments as a template. Released mRNAs are translated by the cellular machinery (4) to generate both structural and nonstructural proteins; alternatively, some copies (4b) will be recruited to viral inclusions (in green) made by viral proteins. One copy of each 10 viral mRNAs will be packaged by viral inner capsid proteins to form intermediate structures (5) where synthesis of the second strand will take place to generate newly formed double-stranded RNA genomes retained in \u201cprogeny\u201d particles (6). These, more abundant particles, in turn, are believed to be responsible for the synthesis of the bulk part of viral mRNA responsible for viral proteins synthesis (as indicated by the dotted arrow). Outer capsid proteins will be added (7) to finalize viral particles assembly before release of fully assembled virions (8).",
