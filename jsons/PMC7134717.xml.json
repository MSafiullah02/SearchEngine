In the appendix, 2 hypothetical intensive care units (ICUs) are described\u2014one exemplifying some key work environment challenges and the second reflecting the implementation of best practices\u2014already in place in some hospitals or suggested by professional associations\u2014which may address deficiencies in existing ICU work environments. We suggest these strategies can be an initial step in enhancing patient care and professional recruitment and retention in our ICUs, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of an appropriately trained and satisfied workforce. The experiences are categorized for the physical, emotional, and professional environments.",

These existing space issues are further aggravated by the need to accommodate the seemingly unremitting growth of new technology in the confined bed spaces that are typical of older hospital facilities. As ICUs frequently operate with less than the minimum space recommended [12], concern has been expressed that such examples of inappropriate unit design contribute to patient safety issues, one example is failure to meet the requirements of modern infection control guidelines. This latter issue was a significant concern in reviews of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Canada [13].",

The sheer number and entanglement of lines found around the bedside of a critically ill patient has the potential to elevate both the number of hospital-acquired infections and medical error. One promising approach to exploring solutions for the ICU's physical environment is through the science of human factor engineering. An ergonomically based redesign of patient care areas in the ICU, together with changes to its care delivery systems, could improve both the work environment and patient outcomes [14]. For such a redesign process to be successful, health care providers, architects, engineers, manufacturers, funders, regulators, accrediting bodies, researchers, and members of the public must work together to design convenient, safe, and functional patient care areas. A number of ICUs have done so already; we have much to learn from them. One suggestion is to work with those professional societies who represent the critical care workforce to design and disseminate solutions. Taking a leadership position in publicizing the sometimes harsh working environment of an ICU, together with a call for support of interdisciplinary research to study not only how to design new ICUs, but how to \u201cretrofit\u201d older ICUs to enhance their design in a way that is more conducive to the physical and emotional health of our critical care workforce, is something on which our critical care societies should easily agree.",

As a consequence, the ICU is often described as an emotionally charged atmosphere where life and death decisions are common and must be made with great rapidity. Intensive care units do excellent work, but, unlike in the movies, care is not always successful. Bad patient outcomes can affect providers, who are known to experience feelings of grief, fear of failure, and suppressed anger and frustration [15]. In addition, the critical care workforce must regularly balance conflicting feelings such as hope vs. realism, decisiveness vs. uncertainty, and compassion vs. professionalism. They want to be healers and dislike seeing patients and their families in distress. An additional source of stress originates from exposure to high levels of work intensity, which are typical of a busy ICU. Of particular importance is the high \u201con-call\u201d demands and its impact on the well-being of ICU professionals, particularly medical residents and fellows. The underlying causes of \u201con-call\u201d stress include chronic sleep deprivation, excessive, and unpredictable work loads, lack of opportunity for adequate consultation, and the need to take important decisions under excessive time constraints [16]. These could lead to various types of physical and emotional stress and were found to be associated with burnout, sick leaves, and suicidal thoughts [17].",

Maslacht, Schaufeli, and Leiter [20] outline a number of individual-centered interventions including assertiveness and stress inoculation training; relaxation and meditation techniques; and training in time management, interpersonal and social skills. Leaders need to encourage workers to admit, and deal with, stress rather than attempt to ignore it. Organizational approaches to dealing with on-call stress may include limiting night shifts, shortening the work period, and monitoring the symptoms of work-related stress, especially in residents and fellows.

Burnout is associated with depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and reduced feelings of personal accomplishment and can lead to turnover and to diminished performance; indeed, such aspects of an ICU's work environment as ineffective communication and lack of group cohesion are also related to high staff turnover rates [23]. Signs of burnout include an inability to leave work, absenteeism, irritability, fatigue, decreased sense of personal accomplishment, and lower levels of job satisfaction [24].",

Excessive workloads might well improve short-term productivity but often at the expense of increasing long-term costs for a health care organization [3]. Staff satisfaction improves with the commitment to ensuring \u201cmanageable\u201d workloads and with employers committing to supporting and encouraging a balance of home and work life. A Canadian survey revealed that 50% of physicians do not feel that they have \u201cbalance in their lives\u201d because of excessive work demands [2]. Pay levels cannot always compensate for these stresses. The literature suggests that empowerment could be achieved through activities such as allowing the workforce more freedom in setting their work schedule, in organizing team-training programs, and in providing regular academic career development opportunities for interested staff [26]. Successful ICUs in the future will be those that provide multiple professional growth opportunities, thereby creating a \u201cdrawing card\u201d for professionals in the workforce.",

As technology advances, the use of electronic enabling approaches, such as telemedicine and electronic ICUs, may play a greater role in providing a rewarding practice environment where appropriate care is delivered in a manner that supports a widely distributed workforce. Attention also continues to be directed to the technological changes that will characterize future ICUs, such as \u201cdistance monitoring,\u201d health informatics, communication networks, resource libraries, point of care tools, and real-time reporting/quality control systems [28], [29].",
