Early evidence of broad aerosolization of the virus in the hospital setting 1 , coupled with demonstrated aerosolization with resuscitative and procedural interventions in the hospital setting of the SARS virus 2,3 , has raised concern among healthcare workers regarding the use of advanced personal protective equipment (PPE) in the performance of such procedures 4 .",

As a result, there have been a large number of groups innovating new potential protective devices for aerosolizing procedures, e.g.: the creation of an \"aerosol box\" by a Taiwanese team 6, 7 .",
