The first section describes the impact of viral opportunistic infection in AIDS; for each virus, clinical presentation and diagnosis, laboratory diagnostic approaches (with emphasis on electron microscopy), and therapeutic interventions attempted to date are discussed. The second segment explores current theories on the pathogenesis of AIDS, and describes diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the syndrome itself. The final section catalogues ultrastructural anomalies in the cells of AIDS patients, many of which have been mistakenly identified as etiologic agents. Address reprint requests to Sara E.

Antiviral therapy is thus of central importance to the palliative treatment and eventual cure of AIDS. Because of the profound deficiency of cell-mediated immunity that typifies the AIDS patient, viruses normally eliminated or kept at bay in the immunocompetent host become overwhelming. We are approaching an era in which therapy for viral agents will be as commonplace as is that for bacteria. As more and more agents are found to be effective against viral infections, precise identification of the causative viruses becomes increasingly essential. Several drugs with proven antiviral efficacy in patients without immunocompromise have been used with some success in individuals with AIDS. Though perpetual maintenance therapy is generally required in such patients to prevent recrudescence of viral infection, improved quality and prolongation of life have been attained in many instances. It is for these reasons that we present a discussion of the virus diseases seen in AIDS patients, along with their clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.",

As will be discussed below, the tissue distribution of these viruses is extremely diverse; HIV has been isolated from bodily fluids from a number of sites as well as from leukocytes. Therefore, all samples from suspected AIDS cases must be treated with extreme care. Gloves should be worn routinely during all processing steps prior to fixation. Specimens should be processed in a biohazard hood if possible; if not, in a quiet corner away from traffic and on a piece of plastic-backed absorbent paper. Extreme care must be taken to prevent creation of aerosols. All disposables must be autoclaved before discarding, and all tools and containers must be disinfected. Easily available disinfectants are 10% Clorox or 70% ethanol (FDA, 1985) .",

A drop of sample is placed on parafilm, and a formvar-and carbon-coated membraned grid is allowed to sit on top of the drop for 5-10 min. The grid is then drained with filter paper and transferred to a drop of 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2-5 min; it is then washed by touching three drops of distilled water, and drained again. This fixation step is not necessary to preserve virus structure, but it is recommended for all samples from AIDS patients as a means of killing pathogenic viruses, since infectious virions can survive negative staining. In the absence of a fixation step, the grid and microscope specimen holder must be properly disinfected after viewing. Negative staining is accomplished by placing the washed, drained grid onto a drop of aqueous, saturated uranyl acetate or 1% phosphotungstate for 30-60 sec and draining. Under no circumstances should the sample be mixed with negative stain and atomized onto the grid. Many samples contain virus at a high enough titer to allow demonstration by the simple, fast, and direct method described above. Viruses present at lower concentrations can frequently be detected by utilizing one of the liquid sample concentration techniques that we have previously described (Miller, 1986) . Briefly, after low-speed debris clarification, the virus can be pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 1 hr at 100,OOOg or airfuge ultracentrifugation (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) at 30 lbhq in (100,OOOg) for 30 min. The pellet is then resuspended in the remaining drop after decanting the supernatant into disinfectant, and the drop is placed on a grid as described above. If an EM rotor is used in the airfuge, the sample can be pelleted directly onto the grid. Low-speed centrifugation with an ul-trafiltration device designed to retain particles 20 nm or greater in diameter (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) is an alternative means of concentrating virus particles.",

A drop of suspension is placed on an agar block, and the liquid is allowed to diffuse into the agar.

A similar technique places a grid on a drop of suspension on agar, and as the solution diffuses into the agar, the virus is concentrated onto the grid (Anderson and Doane, 1972) . If specific antibody is mixed with the agar, it will clump the viruses as they are concentrated onto the grid (Anderson and Doane, 1973) . The utility of specific antibody addition to the specimen is realized only if the researcher has some a priori idea of the possible agents present; if a specific agent is not suspected, pooled gamma globulin may be used in hope that it contains antibody against any viruses present.",

Unlike herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster virus (HZV), CMV is not neurotropic and does not ordinarily cause neurological disease in immunocompetent individuals (Duchowny et al., 1979) . In immunocompromised hosts, however, it can cause either encephalomyelitis or demyelination without inflammation in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (Moskowitz et al., 1984; Tucker et al., 1985) . The mechanism by which demyelination occurs is unknown. Possibilities include viral cytotoxic effects on support cells, release of lytic factors from neighboring cells destroyed by the virus, and autoimmune attack secondary to crossreactivity between viral antigens and myelin or autosensitivity to damaged myelin. Other typical lesions include ventri-IN AIDS 43 culitis with periventricular destruction and cerebral or pituitary involvement (Hawley et al., 1983) and diffuse glial nodule encephalitis (Snider et al., 1983) . Neurological symptoms include encephalopathy, often with progressive dementia, occasional focal motor deficits, seizures, and headache and fever.",

CMV retinitis is characterized by rapidly progressive necrotic lesions, frequently with hemorrhage, which obliterate the retina within 6 months. On ophthalmoscopic examination, virus-induced white spots or granular patches are difficult to distinguish from \"cotton wool spots.\" The latter occur in conditions of ischemia such as diabetes, hypertension, and anemia, and represent microinfarctions of nerve fibers. CMV lesions can be distinguished by their rapidly progressive nature and the presence of hemorrhage (Rodrigues et al., 1983) and by demonstration of the virus in tissue after globe removal or at autopsy (Holland, 1985; Jensen et al., 1984; Pepose et al., 1983) . HSV and toxoplasma can also cause retinitis and confuse the diagnosis (Neuwirth et al., 1982) . Color ophthalmoscope pictures by Rosecan et al. (1986) and De Venecia et al. (1971) demonstrate CMV retinal lesions. CMV retinitis is a poor prognostic sign in AIDS. It usually occurs late in the course of the disease; death frequently occurs within 6-8 weeks following the diag-' nosis of retinitis, regardless of the patient's medical status at its onset (Holland, 1985) . CMV can cause lesions throughout the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus, in AIDS patients. Alimentary CMV is often the first evidence of AIDS (Hinnant et al., 1986) . Manifestations include severe debilitating diarrhea, marked weight loss, fevers, stools positive for occult blood, and occasionally massive colonic hemorrhage or perforation (Frager et al., 1986) . Colonoscopy may show yellow maculopapular lesions (Levinson and Bennetts, 1985) . Radiographic and CT findings are not specific, and early lesions may not show up at all Frager et al., 1986) . The symptoms and endoscopic, colonoscopic, and radiographic findings in CMV GI disease can mimic those of other ailments, including tumors, inflammatory bowel disease with diffuse mucosal ulceration or granulomatous lesions, and other infectious processes (Elta et al., 1986; Frager et al., 1986; Freedman et al., 1985; Knapp et al., 1983) . Diagnosis by biopsy must be made to rule out treatable conditions such as candidiasis.",

The primary cutaneous manifestation of CMV in AIDS is its proposed role as a n etiologic agent in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a neoplasm that presents as raised, reddishpurple lesions of skin and occasionally viscera (see Tucker, . The link between CMV and KS is circumstantial but strong. In the absence of global, severe immunosuppression (as seen in late-stage AIDS), several studies have documented increased titers of antibody to CMV, but not Epstein-Barn virus (EBV) or HSV type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) in patients with KS (Drew, 1986; Giraldo et al., 1984) . The virus itself has been isolated from KS tumor biopsies (Giraldo et al., 1984) , and CMV DNA, mRNA, and nuclear antigen have been demonstrated in tumor tissue Greenspan and Shillitoe, 1984; Fenoglio et al., 1982) . CMV is known to be oncogenic in vitro; it can initiate cellular DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and its genome can induce transformation of cultured cells (Giraldo and Beth, 1986; Rapp, 1984) . The virus has also been linked with adenocarcinoma of the colon (Huang and Roche, 19781, prostatic cancer (Sanford et al., 19771, and cervical cancer (Melnick et al., 1978) . The exact role of CMV in KS tumorigenesis is unclear. It is not known if the virus acts directly via a viral onc gene product, recom-bines with or alters the host genome, or provides continuing immunosuppression enabling a n emerging tumor to escape surveillance (Spector and Spector, 1984) .",

This technque is capable of detecting latently infected cells (Chou and Merigan, 1983; Myerson et al., 1984; Spector and Spector, 1985) . It has been used to demonstrate CMV in colonic tissue that was negative for the virus on routine histologic and immunofluorescence examination (Roche et al., 1981) . Hybridization can be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue after years of storage (Myer-son et al., 1984) . EM has been used with considerable success in the diagnosis of CMV infection in both tissues and bodily fluids, especially urine. In EM examination of thin sections, spherical nucleocapsids of 100 nm are seen, mostly in the nucleus where they are constructed (Fig. lc) ; some naked particles may escape into the cytoplasm before they obtain their outer membrane. Nucleocapsids receive their outer covering by budding through the nuclear membrane, sometimes through internal membranes into vesicles and sometimes through the cytoplasmic membrane. The whole virion may be 150-200 nm in diameter ( Fig. la,b ) Nufioz et al., 1987; Rodrigues et al., 1983) . Because of the pliable, nonornamented outer covering, the virion may be difficult to distinguish from cellular debris in negative stains unless the stain penetrates the membrane and outlines the icosahedral nucleocapsid (Fig. ld,e) . CMV cannot be distinguished by EM from other members of the herpes family.",

            "text": "HSV encephalitis (HSE) has a propensity for involving one or both temporal lobes (Weiner and Fleming, 1984) . Presentations include fever, headache, stiff neck, clouded consciousness, and focal neurologic signs, including seizures, aphasia, and focal motor and sensory deficits. Mortality from HSE is correlated with the level of consciousness at the initiation of antiviral therapy in immunocompetent hosts. In AIDS patients, the rapidity of progression of the disease is proportional to the severity and degree of immune suppression. HSE must be distinguished diagnostically from cryptococcosis, tuberculosis, and bacterial abscesses, all of which may have similar clinical presentations (Hirsch and Schooley, 1983b) . CT and electroencephalography (EEG) may suggest temporal lobe lesions; radionuclide scans may Figs. 1-11. Lower-magnification ( x 20,000) micrographs of virus-infected cells illustrate the relationship of the viruses to the cells. High magnification ( x 100,000) of both thin sections and negative stains of viruses shows virion ultrastructure; all viruses are printed at the same magnification to permit direct comparison of size. Micrographs of virus-like structures are reproduced so that they are presented here at the same final magnification for comparison. The magnification selected (~50,000) is that which is the closest to the majority of the original micrographs. They are 2% times the size of the infected cell micrographs and % the size of the virion micrographs. High magnification of complete membraned virions (arrow) in the cytoplasm. c: High magnification of nucleocapsids (arrows) in the nucleus. d,e: Negatively stained CMV. d The pleomorphic complete particle (large arrowhead) is nondescript and would not be identifiable in a field of cell membrane debris. The nucleocapsid (small arrowhead) has lost its outer covering; it is damaged so that the stain has penetrated the capsid coat. e: The membrane (large arrowhead) still surrounds the nuclsocapsid (small arrowhead) but has been broken so that stain penetrated and outlined the nucleocapsid. Bar in a = lpm; bars in b-e = 100 nm. Figures a-c are reprinted from Gorelkin et al. (1986) with permission from the W.B. Saunders Co. provide improved detection of such lesions (Weiner and Fleming, 1984) , as may MRI (Schroth et al., 1987) . The presence of temporal lobe involvement is strongly suggestive of HSE, but in one study, one-half of a series of clinically suspected HSE cases were eventually shown to have other etiologies (Nahmias et al., 1982) . As with CMV, definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the virus or viral antigens in biopsy tissue, CSF, or aspirates.",

Intravenous acyclovir has been used with success in the treatment of HSE in immunocompetent patients (Levy et al., 1985) and has also been used to manage HSV infections in patients with AIDS (Barbour, 1987) . Intravenous vidarabine decreases the mortality of HSE from 70% to 28% in nonimmunocompromised hosts. Since the large volume of intravenous fluid required for vidarabine administration may engender brain edema, brain biopsy is recommended to establish the necessity for treatment (Furio and Wordell, 1985; Pepose et al., 1985) . Oral acyclovir may prove beneficial as prophylaxis for HSV infection in immunocompromised hosts (Fiddian, 1987; Hirsch and Schooley, 198313) . Topical acyclovir for HSV mucocutaneous lesions shortens the time to resolution in firstepisode infections but is less effective for recurrent disease (Mindel et al., 1987) . Intravenous acyclovir is also effective for serious skin lesions (Hirsch and Schooley, 1983b) . Ocular HSV keratitis can be treated with topical trifluorothymidine and vidarabine (Hirsch and Schooley, 1983b) . Other nucleic acid analogs, such as bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVDU), chloroethyldeoxyuridine (CEDU), and fluoroiodoaracytosine (FIAC) are promising new topical drugs for herpetic keratitis (De Clerq, 1986).

LM examination may reveal intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions difficult to distinguish from those seen in HSV infection (Hsiung, 1982; Malherbe and Strickland-Cholmley, 1980) ; immunostaining may aid in this differentiation. By EM, typical herpes family nucleocapsids and membraned virions are evident in thin sections. HZV in negative stain resembles HSV but can be distinguished from poxvirus. Differentiation of HZV from other herpetic infections is important for the selection of proper drug therapy. DHPG, active against CMV infections, does not affect HZV; a higher concentration of acyclovir is required in HZV than in HSV infections (Murray, 1987) .",

The efficacy of acyclovir is reportedly greater than that of vidarabine (Furio and Wordell, 1985; Shepp et al., 1986) . Additional therapeutic approaches currently under study include oral acyclovir, intramuscular vidarabine (Wood et al., 1987; Sherlock and Corey, 1985) , and new drugs, including BVDU and 6-deoxycyclovir (De Clercq, 1986) . In immunocompetent patients, prednisone decreases the severity and pain of HSV-induced lesions and reduces the likelihood of postherpetic neuralgia. However, corticosteroids may induce dissemination of HZV and are thus contraindicated in immunocompromised patients (Murray, 1987) . Corticosteroids may also predispose to disseminated CMV infection in AIDS patients (Armstrong et al., 1985; Gold, 1985) .",

The virus itself has been found in lungs of patients with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, in the brains of children with AIDS (Andiman et al., 19851 , and in biopsies of oral HL, a condition manifested by white flattened plaques on the sides and ventral sur-face of the tongue. The role of EBV in the pathogenesis of HL is unclear; by immunoperoxidase staining, tissue from HL plaques has also been shown in many cases to contain papillomavirus, and in some cases, HSV (Greenspan et al., , 1985 . The course of HL is variable; there may be spontaneous regression and recurrence. It is not known if the lesion is a premalignant condition, but since both herpesviruses and papillomaviruses have been implicated as possible causative agents, and since both have oncogenic capabilities, regular observation and biopsy is recommended (Youngs et al., 1986) . HL must be distinguished clinically from oral candidiasis, which may respond favorably to antifungal therapy.",

Nuclear virus particles must be differentiated from nuclear granules, a nonspecific clumping of chromatin resulting from cell injury (Fig. 7) . Viruses are uniform in size and have a distinct round shape; nuclear granules are not as uniformly sized or shaped. The ultrastructure of warts and inclusion bodies is described by Almeida (1962) . LM and EM of malignant lesions are described by Kovi et al. (1974) ; however, the nuclear densities described are of questionable viral nature.

The epidemiologic evidence, in particular, is complex and occasionally contradictory. CMV and HSV, though commonly encountered in patients with sexually acquired AIDS, are less prevalent in hemophiliacs and children who contract the disease by hematogenous exposure to HIV and are uncommon in trop-ical areas where AIDS is nonetheless endemic (Blaser and Cohn, 1986) . Proponents of viral cofactor theories counter that many hemophiliacs have serologic evidence of exposure to herpesviruses and HBV (Landay et al., 1983; Sullivan et al., 1986) ; that in others, factor VIII injections may have immunosuppressive properties which provide a n alternative predisposition to HIV infection (Verani et al., 1986) ; and that HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs, including some with high anti-HIV antibody titers (Volsky et al., 19861, may indeed have a lower frequency of overt AIDS than seropositive homosexual men (Sullivan et al., 1986) . Likewise, many children with AIDS, including infants, have evidence of EBV infection Rubinstein, 1983; Scott et al., 1984) ; and the immunological immaturity of neonates could conceivably provide a n alternative to viral cofactors in the facilitation of HIV infection (Rubinstein, 1983) . The inability of the immune system in childhood to mount a full response to HIV infection is illustrated by the observation that some asymptomatic children who harbor HIV lack serologically detectable anti-HIV antibodies (Borkowsky et al., 1987; Pahwa et al., 19861 , and that the seropositive infants with ARC lose antibody response to HIV by age 10 months (Mok et al., 1987) .",

Electron microscopic morphology of the virus is discussed in detail by and Schupbach et al. (1984) .",

Similar inclusions have been seen in other diseases, such as adult T cell leukemia and other neoplasms, multiple sclerosis, and SLE, as well as virus-infected cells (Shamoto et al., 1981; Prineas, 1978; Hammar et al., 1984) . TRF can be differentiated from the simple paired cisternae seen in stimulated cells (Kostianovsky et al., 1987) . Continuity between TRS and TRF has been seen (Fig. llc) , and both are probably the result of membrane proliferation, perhaps caused by viral infection or other stimulation (Feremans et al., 1983; Hammar et al., 1984; Kostianovsky et al., 1984; Schaff et al., 1983) .",

However, in a later publication, Feremans et al. (1984) described the immunolabeling of large cytoplasmic vacuoles resembling MVB in 1% of mononuclear cells from an AIDS patient; the antibodies used were against HTLV-I and bovine leukemia virus followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold. The authors speculated that the labeled material consisted of H N antigens that cross-reacted with antibodies against core proteins of related viruses. Vesicular rosettes have been described in lymphocytes of AIDS patients. These bulbous membrane structures are 300-500 nm in diameter and contain 30-to 60-nm vesicles ( Fig. 110 (Ewing et al., 1983) .
