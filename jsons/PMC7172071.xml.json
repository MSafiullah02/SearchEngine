After entering the respiratory tract, influenza virions attach via HA envelope proteins to sialic acid receptors on ciliated columnar epithelial cells. After cleavage of the HA by cellular proteases, the virus is endocytosed and replication ensues. An essential step in viral release and infectivity is removal of sialic acid residues from the envelopes of new virions by viral neuraminidase. After an incubation of 1 to 4 days, virus shedding and symptoms appear. Viral shedding lasts for 5 to 10 days, but begins to decrease within 3 to 5 days after symptom onset.3\n",

Complications include febrile seizures in young children, sinusitis, viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and encephalopathy. Older adults may not present with fever, but rather with decompensation of underlying cardiac or pulmonary conditions. The main focus of influenza management is prevention through vaccination, and annual vaccination is now recommended for all persons older than 6 months.4\n",

Thus when suspicion is high, antiviral therapy should be administered without waiting for laboratory confirmation.5 For severe disease, treatment may still be useful when initiated after 48 hours, and should not be withheld. The adamantanes, amantadine and rimantidine, block the influenza A M2 protein ion channel and thus prevent viral uncoating. However, because of widespread resistance, the adamantanes are no longer recommended for routine use. The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, are active against both influenza A and B. Although resistance has been reported with oseltamivir, most viruses are susceptible at present. Zanamivir is administered via inhalation and, owing to the risk of bronchospasm, is contraindicated in persons with underlying pulmonary disease.

            "text": "Viral diagnostic methods have evolved dramatically in the past 20 years, as summarized in Table 1\n. The traditional gold standard of viral diagnostics, conventional cell culture, can require up to 10-14 days to generate final results. Thus the introduction of rapid centrifugation culture, with results in 1 to 2 days, was a great advance. Viral antigen assays such as immunochromatography (IC) or direct immunofluorescence assays (DFA) are capable of yielding results in 10 minutes to 2 hours and are widely used. Molecular tests are now available that provide high sensitivity with a turnaround time (TAT) of approximately 1 hour. Thus, advancing technology has allowed clinicians to redefine what is considered as rapid testing. Although IC assays are most frequently referred to as rapid flu tests, in this article rapid testing is defined as those assays capable of providing a result in less than 3 hours. This time frame was selected based on recently released nucleic acid amplified tests (NAATs) that can, theoretically, be performed round the clock by core laboratory staff. In considering such assays it will be important to establish their performance characteristics in reference to the gold-standard methods of conventional culture and conventional reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays.",

The melting of double-stranded DNA occurs in a sequence-specific manner, and this is associated with a change in detectable fluorescence. One of the most common real-time PCR assays uses hydrolysis probes (eg, TaqMan probes) that contain a reporter fluorophore and quencher in close proximity. When the probe is intact, fluorescence from the reporter is quenched, but when the probe binds to a DNA segment undergoing amplification, the 5\u2032-3\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades the probe, releasing the reporter from the quencher and leading to detectable fluorescence. For assays using this design, specificity is determined by both primer and probe sequences, and although a product may be amplified, mismatches in the probe might lead to failed hydrolysis and no detectable fluorescence. Other real-time assay designs circumvent this problem by incorporating the fluorescent reporter and quencher into the primer itself.",

However, for regulatory approval only the GeneXpert Flu was compared with a NAAT, and all others were compared with culture. NAATs are generally more sensitive than culture, thus this would lead to an overestimation of the sensitivity of these assays. Finally, all data from FDA trials are likely obtained under ideal circumstances and may not represent real-world performance. Thus, the sensitivities and specificities determined during FDA trials may not be borne out by subsequent postmarketing studies using NAAT as the gold standard (see later discussion).",

Five of the studies compared the FilmArray with other highly multiplexed assays including the Luminex RVP and RVP Fast, Qiagen ResPlex II, and GenMark eSensor. Others used LDTs or the Prodesse ProFlu+ as their comparator method. Not all studies differentiated among influenza A subtypes. The sensitivity of the influenza A assay ranged from 90.2% to 100%, and specificity was 100% in all studies. Detection of influenza B was between 77.3% and 100% sensitive, with 100% specificity across all studies. Performance of the FilmArray for influenza A subtypes was variable. Nearly all of these reports also compared the performance of the other analytes contained in the FilmArray panel either through comparison with other highly multiplexed tests, other commercial assays, or LDTs.",

For well-characterized respiratory pathogens, identification of a potentially causative agent could be beneficial, but sensitive multiplex assays lead to higher rates of identification of coinfection and infection with agents associated with the common cold such as rhinovirus or human coronaviruses. In the former cases, it can be difficult to determine the virus responsible for the patient\u2019s current presentation. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses can cause more severe disease, especially in immunocompromised hosts, yet may be disregarded as normal flora by some providers. Alternatively, symptoms may be ascribed to these viruses when other processes may be contributing to disease.",
