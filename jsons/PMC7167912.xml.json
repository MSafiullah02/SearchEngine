Examples of molds in significantly greater concentration in the Springfield school were Aspergillus ochraceus and A. unguis. In an earlier study, infant exposures in homes to higher concentrations of these two molds were linked to the development of asthma 11. By contrast, the five schools in Idaho, with no history of water damage, had low concentrations of Group 1 molds and an average ERMI value of \u22122.87, well below average on the home ERMI scale 6.",

In the ERMI calculation, the sum of the logs of the Group 2 molds is used to adjust for external factors such as season, cleaning frequency, window use for ventilation 6. It is important to make this adjustment because of the geographic differences between the Springfield and the Idaho school locations. So although two Group 2 molds, A. ustus and Cladosporium cladosporioides 2, were in greater concentration in the Springfield school, this was balanced by the significantly greater concentration of Cladosporium herbarum in the Idaho schools. The result is that the average sum of the logs of the Group 2 molds is not significantly different in the Springfield and Idaho schools. Therefore, the differences in ERMI values between the Springfield school and the Idaho schools appear to be due to the differences in Group 1 mold growth.",

The NIOSH investigation found that twenty of the employees met the NIOSH physicians\u2019 case definition of work\u2010related asthma.

Also, many chemical and other biological exposures that have been linked to asthma were not measured in our study and they could be just as relevant as mold 14. Also, the PM2.5 exposure measurements were limited to short sampling times and only a few locations in the school.

In homes, a single dust sample is the standard protocol for the ERMI analysis 6. In the investigation of the Springfield school, a dense sampling protocol was used (10 samples per level). However, we found that there was a great uniformity in the ERMI values in these samples. So the number of samples obtained in the Idaho schools was reduced to two per level, which might be more practical. More studies will be needed to determine the optimal sampling density for schools. In addition, the ERMI scale for schools would be improved with a random national survey of schools, as was done to create the ERMI for homes.",
