It was difficult to make a biased judgment according to her symptoms, especially when routine pathogen culture, PCR and serological examination were all negative. Therefore, we chose mNGS with wide coverage and high accuracy, which found the leishmania.VL-HLH is a systemic disease caused by leishmania, transmitted by infected sandflies, and meet the criteria of HLH-2004, with an average incubation period of 3-8 months (Gramiccia et al., 2013). Adamczick C (Adamczick et al., 2018) has reported the interval between clinical symptoms of twin children infected simultaneously was up to 9 months. Furthermore, VL had a wide range of clinical symptoms, which overlap with severe infection, hematological diseases and autoimmune diseases, such as fever, splenomegaly, and hemocytopenia, which confused the clinicians greatly. Common tests of leishmaniasis included serology, microscopic examination of bone marrow and PCR. Rajagopala S (Rajagopala et al., 2008) found that leishmane-donovan bodies could be seen in only 35.3% of patients in the first BMA microscopic examination, and in 78% of VL-HLH patients after repeated BMAs. In addition, it should be emphasized that the identification of the leishman-donovan bodies was closely related to the experience of laboratorians. The rk39 test is the most common serological method in China, and the result depends on the chromogenic reaction, which may be unconspicuous for low titer antibody in the early stage of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection. Moreover, different individual immune responses and the quality of test strips would also affect the results. Reports about negative rk39 in children with VL-HLH are not rare in China (Guo et al.,2011) and abroad (Maria et al.,2016). The",

Different from the traditional PCR, mNGS does not need primers and specific amplification, and it can detect multiple pathogen gene sequences simultaneously, and achieve comprehensive unbiased screening quickly and accurately ( Westblade et al., 2016). Currently, mNGS can detect more than 6,350 bacteria, 1,798 viruses, 1,064 fungi and 234 parasites. Miao Q (Miao et al., 2018) and Zinter MS (Zinter et al., 2019) confirmed that mNGS with high sensitivity was less affected by antibiotic exposure and immune function than traditional etiological detections. However, it should be noted that the positive results must be interpreted in the clinical context, not simply identified as the pathogen (Chiu et al., 2019). In this case, leishmania is detected by mNGS, and the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f condition is rapidly relieved after anti-VL treatment, which confirms the accuracy of the detection results.",

We speculated that the secondary HLH caused by infection might exist, while corresponding tests for tumors and autoimmune diseases were negative.
