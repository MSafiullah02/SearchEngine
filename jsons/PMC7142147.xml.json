In these studies, prisoners and military recruits were vaccinated with formalin-inactivated or a serially passaged live-attenuated strain of Mp, then subsequently challenged with a virulent strain of the bacterium. While some protection was observed, many vaccinated individuals in both studies exhibited more severe clinical symptoms than those receiving a placebo control8,9. Recent studies by our group (and others) have since recapitulated VED in an animal model by utilizing live-attenuated or crude extract Mp vaccine candidates, respectively10\u201313. In these murine models, VED is characterized by more severe histopathology post-challenge, when compared to sham vaccinated, Mp challenged mice. VED has also been observed in vaccine candidates against other Mycoplasma species, making the identification of the causative factors a crucially important task for vaccine development against these atypical pathogens.",

An initial pilot study indicated that vaccination of BALB/c mice with LAMPs resulted in VED after challenge with virulent Mp. We performed proteomic analysis to reveal lipoproteins, elongation factors, chaperones and chaperonins, and cytadherence proteins (previously found to induce strong antibody responses15\u201317) as the most abundant immunogenic and antigenic components of the LAMP fraction (Fig. 1a\u2013f). Of these, lipoproteins are the most abundant (31.79%) (Fig. 1a) and include twenty-two lipoproteins representing all six Mp lipoprotein families (Fig. 1b, c). Family 2 lipoproteins, paralogs of the immunodominant Mycoplasma gallisepticum nucleotide-binding virulence factor MslA18,19, were the most abundant LAMP lipoproteins, making up 43.22% of the lipoprotein fraction (Fig. 1c). Lipoproteins not belonging to a multigene family were the second most abundant lipoproteins in the lipoprotein fraction (32.83%), followed by Family 4 lipoproteins (11.73%), Family 3 lipoproteins (5.53%) then Family 6 lipoproteins (4.36%) (Fig. 1c). Members of Family 5 lipoproteins (which are specific to Mp) were also identified in the fraction, albeit at minute relative quantities (0.67%) (Fig. 1c). Mycoplasma lipoprotein lipid moieties are known to be potent immuno-stimulators, inducing expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 following the recognition of their lipid moieties by Toll-like receptor complexes20. Given that these cytokines are frequently associated with immunopathology, we hypothesized that sensitization by Mp lipoprotein lipid moieties during vaccination induces VED upon challenge with virulent Mp.",

Successful delipidation was assessed via a TLR2 bioassay. In murine macrophages, LAMPs stimulated higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 than Aq and Ins fractions. Delipidation significantly reduced LAMP-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 production, notably to levels lower than those stimulated by Aq or Ins fractions (Fig. 2b). Surprisingly, delipidation also reduced Aq fraction-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 production, suggesting that some lipoproteins may have sequestered to the Aq phase during TX-114 phase partitioning. Delipidation did not affect the ability of the Ins fraction to stimulate TNF-\u03b1 production in vitro (Fig. 2b).",

Shortly after vaccination, mice receiving non-lipase-treated fractions began to display clinical signs consistent with mild septic shock (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1), which we quantified as a group clinical score (Fig. 2c). While these clinical signs abated by 48-h post-vaccination, they point to potential immediate safety concerns for vaccine candidates containing intact lipoproteins. Notably, early clinical signs were absent in mice vaccinated with delipidated fractions. Given that in vivo data mirrored those obtained in vitro (Fig. 2b), early clinical signs may have resulted from the over-stimulation of peritoneal immune cells by the lipid moieties of native Mp lipoproteins.",

Furthermore, vaccination with LAMPs did not reduce bacterial loads, suggesting that the induced inflammation is solely pathologic and consistent with VED (Fig. 2e). Importantly, vaccination with delipidated LAMPs (dLAMPs) did not exacerbate lung pathology (Fig. 2d, f), demonstrating that the factors responsible for VED are the lipid moieties of Mp lipoproteins. Compared to controls, dLAMP-vaccinated mice also had significantly lower bacterial loads (Fig. 2e).

            "text": "The identification of Mp lipoprotein lipid moieties as the cause of Mp VED is a breakthrough for the field, overcoming a major roadblock for Mp vaccine development. The findings presented here may be broadly applicable to other Mycoplasma species for which vaccine induced disease exacerbation has been reported. Vaccination of calves with inactivated whole cell vaccines and partially purified membrane proteins of Mycoplasma bovis resulted in increased pulmonary pathology upon virulent challenge21,22. Additionally, vaccination of cattle with inactivated whole cell Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and a subunit lipoprotein Q (LppQ) vaccine also were reported to exacerbate the effects of Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in challenged animals23. These studies did not identify the lipid moieties of lipoproteins or any other factors as the causative factors of VED in these cases. Given the parallels of these studies with our data, however, it is attractive to speculate that the lipid moieties of the lipoproteins included in these vaccine candidates may have been the maladaptive factors responsible for disease exacerbation. Indeed, vaccination of cattle with the N terminus of LppQ (which includes the region where the lipid moieties attach) failed to be protective and was also associated with adverse events24. It is important, however, to note that more studies need to be conducted to demonstrate the maladaptive effect of lipoproteins in ruminant mycoplasmosis vaccines.",
