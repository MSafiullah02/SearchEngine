A number of these pathogens have thus evolved an elaborate molecular armory that includes pathogen-encoded ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating activities, as well as proteins capable of manipulating/hijacking the host's Ub machinery. The known functions of these pathogen-encoded activities are quite diverse. Regulation of the cell cycle, activation or suppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway, destruction of the class I MHC glycoprotein, and regulation of intracellular trafficking are but a few examples (Gao and Luo [2006] and references cited therein).",

A functional proteomic approach\u2014where active DUBs are targeted selectively in crude cell extracts with epitope-tagged, Ub-based suicide substrates, retrieved by immunoprecipitation, and identified by mass spectrometry\u2014has proved particularly useful in identifying new deubiquitinating enzymes (Borodovsky et al., 2002, Ovaa et al., 2004). Using this approach, we identified a unique deubiquitinating activity present in herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1/\u03b1 subfamily)-infected cells (Kattenhorn et al., 2005). The DUB activity mapped to the N-terminal portion of UL36, a large (3156 residues) and presumably multifunctional protein of the \u03b1-herpesvirus HSV-1. UL36 is a constituent of the amorphous proteinaceous layer located between the nucleocapsid and the envelope of the herpesvirus particle, referred to as tegument. All known herpesviruses sequenced to date contain homologs of this large tegument protein. The putative key catalytic residues of the protease domain found in UL36 are conserved throughout all herpesviridae subfamilies: \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 (Kattenhorn et al., 2005) (Schlieker et al., 2005). Deubiquitinating activity was confirmed for the UL36 homologs of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV/\u03b2 subfamily), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV/\u03b2 subfamily), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV/\u03b3 subfamily), M48, UL48, and BPLF1, respectively (Schlieker et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2006). Although the in vivo function of this activity is currently unknown, its strict conservation through all herpesvirus subfamilies suggests an important role in their biology. To gain insights into the structural and functional properties of this activity, we set out to determine the structure of this enzyme.",

A comparison of the M48USP topology to eukaryotic DUBs and other proteases established that M48USP is the founding member of a structurally distinct class of deubiquitinating enzymes, which we designate herpesvirus tegument USPs (htUSPs). The presence of this family of cysteine proteases has implications for its possible role as a target to manipulate the interaction of MCMV and by inference, other herpesviruses, with their host.",

The proposed catalytic triad and oxyanion residues of this cysteine protease module are conserved in all herpesviruses. The tegument protease domains otherwise display only moderate sequence conservation (\u226412% identity between representatives of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subfamilies) yet share a high degree of structural similarity according to secondary structure predictions (Schlieker et al., 2005). Neither BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) nor threading programs that employ sequence alignment and protein-fold recognition algorithms (McGuffin et al., 2000) uncovered homologs other than herpesvirus tegument proteins (data not shown). This suggested that htUSPs have structural properties that are distinct from known DUBs and other cysteine proteases (Kattenhorn et al., 2005, Sulea et al., 2006). Accordingly, UL36USP and its homologs represent an independent family (C76) in the CA clan of proteases in the MEROPS peptidase database (Rawlings et al., 2004). To explore the structural and mechanistic properties of htUSPs, we expressed an N-terminal fragment encompassing residues 1\u2013236 of the MCMV M48 tegument protein (M48USP), which likely comprises the entire USP domain of M48, because it is followed by an \u223c70 residue region that is likely unstructured according to secondary structure predictions. To confirm that this domain is a functional deubiquitinating enzyme, we first tested the ability of M48USP to hydrolyze the fluorogenic substrate Ub C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC). UbAMC hydrolysis followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with kcat / KM = 9.17 \u00d7 106 M\u22121 s\u22121 (data not shown). To determine whether M48USP can cleave true isopeptide-linked Ub chains, we examined its ability to attack K48-linked or K63-linked diUb by using a 500-fold excess of substrate over enzyme. Both adducts were converted to free monomeric Ub, albeit with \u223c5-fold slower kinetics for K63-linked compared to K48-linked diUb (\nFigure 1A).",

Cell lysates were prepared and incubated in the absence and presence of M48USP or its catalytically inactive counterpart, M48USP-C23A (Schlieker et al., 2005), and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Figure 1B). Both free Ub and Ub conjugates were readily detectable, the latter being more prominent in samples derived from ZL3VS-treated cells. Upon exposure to nanomolar concentrations of M48USP, the majority of cellular Ub conjugates were deubiquitinated, as judged by the near-complete elimination of high molecular weight, anti-HA-reactive material and a corresponding increase in free Ub. For comparison, we also tested the homologous EBV-derived protease BPLF1USP and observed similar deubiquitinating activity (Figure 1B), confirming that the activity exerted on poly-Ub adducts is conserved among herpesviruses.",

We crystallized M48USP in a covalent complex with UbVME, a suicide inhibitor that forms a thioether bond with the active-site cysteine of DUBs (Borodovsky et al., 2002, Misaghi et al., 2005). The structure was determined by using crystals of SeMet-labeled M48USP covalently bound to UbVME in a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiment. Continuous electron density was observed for residues 1\u2013232 of the two M48USP molecules and all residues of the two UbVME molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model was refined to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution to an R factor of 15.8% (Rfree = 21.4%) (see\nTable 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). Because the C\u03b1 atoms of both complexes can be superimposed with 0.3 \u00c5 root-mean-square deviation (rmsd), we limit our discussion to a single complex of M48USP with UbVME (chains A and C).",

Electron density indicates a 1.9 \u00c5 covalent bond between the M48USP C23 S\u03b3 atom and the C\u03b2-carbon atom of the former VME moiety that replaces the C-terminal G76 of wild-type Ub (Figure 2C), reminiscent of the covalent complex between UbVME and UCH-L3 (Misaghi et al., 2005). Complex formation buries 1840 \u00c52 of solvent-accessible surface area, corresponding to 816 \u00c52 (7%) and 1024 \u00c52 (21%) of the total solvent-accessible surface area of free M48USP and UbVME, respectively. The size of this interface is comparable to the corresponding ones in UCH enzymes, e.g., 2300 A2 in UCH-L3 (Misaghi et al., 2005), but smaller than in HAUSP (3600 \u00c52) (Hu et al., 2002) and other USPs. Electrostatic surface potential calculations show a high degree of charge complementarity: positively charged surface regions of the extended Ub C terminus (residues 71\u201375) are deeply buried in the largely acidic cleft of M48USP (Figure 2B). The backbone of the Ub C terminus adopts an extended \u03b2 conformation and is extensively coordinated by seven salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to residues lining the M48USP cleft, conferring sequence specificity for the Ub C terminus (\nFigure 3A). In addition, a hydrophobic pocket lined by M48USP V140 and Y192 accommodates the Ub L73 side chain (Figures 2B and 3A). Binding of the C-terminal Ub segment in an extended conformation in the active-site cleft is a common feature of DUBs, as observed in the crystal structures of Ub derivatives in complex with UCH-L3, HAUSP, USP2, and USP14 (Hu et al., 2002, Hu et al., 2005, Misaghi et al., 2004, Renatus et al., 2006).",

This prediction is unambiguously confirmed for C23, which forms a thioether linkage to the UbVME suicide inhibitor (Figure 2C). The addition of C23 to the former VME moiety imposes an sp3 configuration on the VME \u03b2 carbon atom, thus resembling the tetrahedral reaction intermediate during catalysis, but with the oxyanion replaced by a hydrogen atom. This hydrogen is located in a pocket that is lined by the conserved Q10 and corresponds to the oxyanion hole observed in other cysteine proteases (Figure 4C). Thus, the transition-state oxyanion is likely coordinated by the Q10 side chain and the backbone NH groups of Q22 and the catalytically active C23 (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the catalytic aspartic acid residue can be assigned to D156 due to its location and distance to the catalytic C23 (Figure 4B). Consistently, an D156A substitution results in a 180-fold reduction of catalytic activity (\nFigure 5A).",

H158 is conserved throughout the herpesviridae and forms a hydrogen bond to the conserved D156 (Figure 4B) and for these reasons is the plausible candidate to act as catalytic base. However, both histidines are >5 \u00c5 from the catalytic C23, resulting in a misaligned catalytic triad (Figure 4B). A side-chain rearrangement is required to position either histidine within hydrogen bonding distance to C23 and D156, in order to form a functional proton relay system. Possible scenarios for either rearrangement can be derived from structurally related cysteine proteases. Figure 4D shows that in superimposed structures of M48USP and UCH-L3, C23, D156, and H141 correspond to UCH-L3 catalytic triad residues. Therefore, to form a functional catalytic triad, the M48USP H141 side chain may adopt a rotamer conformation observed for the corresponding UCH-L3 histidine, as is observed in the vast majority of cysteine proteases. On the other hand, the conserved M48USP H158 could instead participate in catalysis after adopting a conformation that corresponds to the unusual histidine alignment found in the catalytic triad of the structurally related human cysteine protease Atg4B (Figure 4E).",

            "text": "To address which histidine serves as catalytic base, we exchanged either or both histidine residues to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Enzymatic activity was assessed by measuring the hydrolysis of UbAMC. Both single substitutions remained enzymatically active, with a 3.5-fold and a 146-fold reduction of hydrolytic activity compared to WT enzyme for the H141A and H158A mutants, respectively (Figure 5A). In contrast, the double-mutant protein (H141A/H158A) completely lacked catalytic activity (Figure 5A). However, activity was partially restored in a concentration-dependent manner upon addition of imidazole (data not shown). We conclude that H158 is the principal catalytic histidine as judged by the more pronounced reduction of catalytic activity of the H158A mutant, consistent with H158 being conserved throughout the htUSPs. Nevertheless, the residual activity of H158A is still substantial at saturating substrate concentrations (kcat = 1.38/min, Figure 5B). To confirm that the residual catalytic activity observed for H158A indeed involves H141, we mutated H141 to glycine or tyrosine, the corresponding residues in HSV-1 and EBV, respectively (Figure 4A), or to glutamine\u2014a conservative replacement\u2014into a H158A background (Figure 5A). All three double mutants were catalytically inactive, even when tested at 50-fold-higher enzyme and saturating substrate concentrations (Figure 5B). Therefore, neither glycine, tyrosine, nor glutamine can replace H141 when H158 is changed to alanine. Because the H141Q and H141Y single mutants had 58% and 68% of WT activity, respectively (Figure 5A), the inactivity of the double mutants is unlikely to result from structural distortions, albeit we cannot formally exclude this possibility.",

In general, DUBs feature a largely acidic catalytic cleft that accommodates the complementary basic C-terminal Ub stretch (71LRLRGG76), implicating the cleft in substrate recognition and specificity (Hu et al., 2002). For instance, the C-terminal sequence of SUMO (72QEQTGG76) is clearly different and of opposite charge compared to the Ub C terminus, and consequently, SUMO cannot bind to M48USP. Other Ubls, however, terminate in a sequence similar or identical to Ub (Figure S1B). For example, the ISG15 C-terminal sequence LRLRGG is identical to that of Ub. Therefore, additional interactions outside the active-site cleft must determine substrate specificity. A superposition of the structure of free ISG15 (Narasimhan et al., 2005) on UbVME bound to M48USP indicates that the ISG15 C terminus would require only minor structural changes to enter the M48USP active site (data not shown). However, the M48USP \u03b2 hairpin that tightly interacts with the Ub core domain (Figure 3A) lacks surface complementarity for the ISG15 core domain (data not shown), suggesting that several unfavorable contacts between the \u03b2 hairpin of M48USP and ISG15 mainly account for the discrimination between Ub and ISG15.",

This difference was suggested to be crucial for Ub discrimination of the NEDD8-specific protease NEDP1 (Shen et al., 2005) and, by analogy, could also explain why NEDD8 is not a M48USP substrate. In addition, NEDD8 A72 cannot form the hydrogen bond to M48USP T80 as observed for Ub R72 (Figure 3A). To test whether the NEDD8 A72 indeed determines M48USP specificity, we generated a NEDD8-based suicide inhibitor (NEDD8-VME) and its mutant derivative (NEDD8A72R-VME). In agreement with our previous data (Schlieker et al., 2005), we observed negligible covalent adduct formation of M48USP with NEDD8-VME. In contrast, NEDD8A72R-VME readily reacted with M48USP to yield a covalent adduct (Figure S2). This indicates that R72 is a key determinant for M48USP substrate specificity because the single substitution of A72 by arginine in NEDD8 renders it a M48USP substrate.",

A structural similarity search using the DALI algorithm (Holm and Sander, 1993) showed that \u223c140 aa in the catalytic core of M48USP share moderate structural similarity to papain-like cysteine proteases (best Z score, 7.1) and only weak similarities to DUBs like USP6 from S. cerevisiae (1vjv; Z score, 4.2) and human UCH-L3 (1uch; Z score, 2.2) (Table S1). For comparison, UCH-L3/UCH-L1 and USP2/HAUSP pairwise comparisons yield Z scores of 33 and 27, respectively, whereas a pairwise comparison of two classes, e.g., UCH-L1/HAUSP as representatives from UCH and USP families, yields scores of \u223c4. We conclude that M48USP is a member of the papain protease superfamily but is only distantly related to cellular DUBs of known structure.

All three enzymes share secondary structure elements of the papain fold. Besides the different Ub binding mode of M48USP compared to UCHs and USPs (see above), several topology differences between these DUB representatives validate their classification in three different classes. First, the order of secondary structure elements in UCH-L3 is different from that of other cysteine protease DUBs (Figure 6). Second, UCH-L3 features a crossover loop that is disordered in the substrate-free structure and ordered above the active-site cleft when Ub is bound (Johnston et al., 1997, Misaghi et al., 2005). Third, HAUSP lacks an \u03b1 helix corresponding to \u03b1 helix C in M48USP and features an extensive \u201cN-terminal\u201d insertion dubbed the finger domain that forms mainly water-mediated contacts with the Ub (Ubl) core domain during catalysis (Hu et al., 2002). Fourth, M48USP is more closely related to the classic papain-like proteases than to other DUBs and features a unique \u03b2 hairpin to recognize Ub and discriminate other Ubls (see above and Table S1). Fifth, sequence alignments (Figure 4A) and our mutational data suggest that H158 is the principal participant of the catalytic triad, yielding the primary sequence order cysteine \u2192 aspartic acid \u2192 histidine. This order has so far been observed only in Atg4B (Kumanomidou et al., 2006), whereas all other cysteine proteases of known structure, including DUBs, feature a cysteine \u2192 histidine \u2192 aspartic acid/asparagine catalytic triad in their primary sequence. In conclusion, M48USP shows distinct features in its tertiary fold and catalytic triad and a unique Ub binding \u03b2 hairpin. In agreement with the listing of HSV UL36 as the founding member of a new cysteine protease family in the MEROPS database (Gao and Luo, 2006, Rawlings et al., 2004), we conclude that the M48USP structure defines a previously unknown class of cysteine protease DUBs and confirms the existence of a new cysteine protease family (C76), which we term herpesvirus tegument USPs (htUSPs).",

Furthermore, H141, which is not conserved but might participate in catalysis, is also shown. The covalently bound UbVME is represented by green sticks. Note that the catalytic triad is misaligned because both histidines are >5 \u00c5 from C23. (C) The proposed oxyanion hole is occupied by the hydrogen atom of the \u03b2 carbon atom of the former vinylmethylester moiety, thus resembling a catalytic intermediate except that the oxyanion is replaced by a hydrogen. The Q10 side chain and NH groups of C23 and Q22 are <4 \u00c5 from this hydrogen atom and are thus likely to coordinate the oxyanion during catalysis. (D) Superposition of the active sites of M48USP (yellow) and UCH-L3 (pink).
