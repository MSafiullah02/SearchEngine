EV71 predominantly affects children under 5 years old, and causes severe diseases with high morbidity and mortality (Sato et al., 2006). Since it was first isolated in 1969, EV71 outbreaks have occurred frequently in western Pacific region countries, including China (Lee et al., 2010, Samuda et al., 1987), Japan (Fujimoto et al., 2002), Malaysia (Chan et al., 2000), and Singapore (Singh et al., 2002). The World Health Organization has estimated the occurrence of one million new HFMD cases in China alone between 2011 and 2014 (World Health Organization, 2015). To date, no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs have been available to prevent or treat EV71 infection (Wu et al., 2010, Yee and Poh, 2015). Therefore, it is necessary to identify the host factors involved in the replication of EV71 to control the development and complications of HFMD.",

            "text": "EV71 is a non-enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA of approximately 7.4 kb nucleotides. Protein 3A, a nonstructural viral protein of 87 amino acids in length, is required for enterovirus RNA replication (Teoule et al., 2013). 3A proteins play important role in enterovirus replication through the formation (with the 3CD protein) of replication organelles via remodeling of the internal cell membrane. Analyses of enterovirus 3A proteins have led to the identification of several cellular partners of this protein. The 3A proteins of PV and of the related coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) can interact with the cellular Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1). By interacting with GBF1, 3A inhibits the cellular secretory pathway. The membrane-anchored 3A protein modulates GBF1/Arf1 activity, resulting in the preferential recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2 to sites of viral RNA replication. PI4KIII\u03b2 recruitment leads to the enrichment of virus-induced membranous organelles in PI4P, which has been shown to facilitate viral RNA replication. (Belov et al., 2005, Belov and van Kuppeveld, 2012, Dorobantu et al., 2015, Greninger, 2015, Hsu et al., 2010, van der Schaar et al., 2013). However, the function of 3A in the RNA replication of EV71 has been rarely reported. So, it is necessary to detect the mechanism of protein 3A and further explore the host factors involved in EV71 infection. Thus, to identify the host factors that could interact with 3A protein of EV71 may be a potential target for the therapy of HFMD.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that ATP1B3 can up-regulate lymphocyte activity and promote the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10(Chiampanichayakul et al., 2002) (Chruewkamlow et al., 2015). However, whether ATP1B3 can mediate the innate immune responses during EV71 infection is largely unknown. Moreover, Type I interferons (IFNs), namely IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2, which lead to the induction of antiviral pathways within hours can be induced in virus-infected cells (Wu and Chen, 2014). Type I IFNs have clinically been used for treatment of many viruses and tumors. Thus, identifying the host factors that can induce the production of type I IFNs is extremely important in controlling viral infection.",

Results of confocal microscopic analysis of the subcellular localization revealed that the 3A fusion protein showed the same location with the ATP1B3 fusion protein on the membrane of 293T cells (\nFig. 1A).

Following anti-Flag or anti-HA immunoprecipitation, the interaction between Flag-3A and HA-ATP1B3 was assessed by immunoblotting the precipitates for the presence of ATP1B3 or 3A.

To explore the mechanism of the ATP1B3-mediated anti-EV71 response, we examined the relationship between ATP1B3 expression levels and Type I IFNs production. The levels of IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA in RD cells were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The intracellular levels of IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA in RD cells were significantly decreased after knockdown of ATP1B3 expression using ATP1B3 siRNA (\nFig. 5A). On the contrary, IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA levels were significantly increased when ATP1B3 was overexpressed compared with control vector (Fig. 5B). This showed that ATP1B3 promoted the production of type I IFNs. Since EV71 replication was reduced in ATP1B3 overpression cells, it would be intriguing to determine if such reduction is associated with the elevated type I interferon expression. We infected ATP1B3 overpression cells or vector controls with EV71 at an MOI of 1, cultured cells with anti-human interferon-\u03b11/\u03b2 antibodies or isotype control IgG, and examined the viral replication using RT-PCR assay. We found that ATP1B3 overpression-induced reduction of viral growth was increased by treatment with antiinterferon-\u03b11/\u03b2 antibodies but not by its isotype control IgG (Fig. 5C), indicating that neutralization of type I interferon in the cell culture by anti-interferon-\u03b11/\u03b2 antibodies restored EV71 growth in ATP1B3 overpression cells.",

More than 80% of the pathogens isolated from patients died from HFMD were identified as EV71. Lots of research on developing antiviral drugs and vaccines were largely unsuccessful. Intravenous immunoglobulin, ribavirin and pleconaril have been demonstrated the antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo, but these drugs cannot inhibit the cytopathic effect induced by EV71 (Yip et al., 2013). Previous studies have shown that 3A protein of enterovirus plays a critical role in viral RNA replication and is a potential target for antiviral therapy (Deng et al., 2014, Gao et al., 2015, Sadeghipour et al., 2012). Itraconazole and enviroxime can target viral protein 3A and/or 3AB and suppress replication of EV71 in vitro (Arita et al., 2010, Gao et al., 2015). So we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening procedure to screen human proteins that could interact with EV71 3A protein. Moreover, we confirmed human protein ATP1B3 is the target of EV71 3A protein. Thus it is important to explore the function of human ATP1B3 during EV71 infection.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that some subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase can interact with various viral proteins and affect the replication of viruses. It has been demonstrated that ATP1B1 subunit interacts with HCMV UL136 protein, M2 proteins of influenza A and B viruses and inhibit the virus replication (Cui et al., 2011, Mi et al., 2010). ATP1A1 has also been reported to inhibit entry of coronavirus into host cells by regulating the Src signaling pathway (Burkard et al., 2015). ATP1B3 is expressed separately from the \u03b1 subunit, and plays a role in regulation of the immune response (Chruewkamlow et al., 2015). A recent published study suggested that ATP1B3 can modulate the restriction of HIV-1 production and NF-\u03baB activation in a BST-2 dependent manner (Nishitsuji et al., 2015). All of these researches suggest that ATPase subunits play an important role in innate immunity against virus infection. However, the function of ATP1B3 in EV71 infection has been largely unknown. In this manuscript, we found EV71 infection can induce increases in ATP1B3 levels. Further studies demonstrated that ATP1B3 can inhibit EV71 replication along with the induction of IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2. Therefore ATP1B3 play an important role in antiviral immune response. Type I IFNs serve as key factors in the innate and adaptive immune responses against virus infection. IFNs have been demonstrated effective in many viruses such as influenza A virus (Stifter et al., 2016), hepatitis C virus (Melian and Plosker, 2001), coxsackievirus type A16 infection (Yang et al., 2015). Some studies have demonstrated that type I IFNs represent an essential innate defense mechanism for controlling EV71 infection both in vitro and in vivo (Hung et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2012). Previous studies have shown that EV71 infection can induce IFN-\u03b2 production which is dependent on the infectious dose, but the interferon is not cell type specific (Lu et al., 2012). It has also demonstrated that EV71 infection promoted the expression of son of sevenless and increased the secretion of IL-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Shi et al., 2014). In our current study, we found that the levels of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2) were negatively associated with EV71 replication. Previous studies have shown that IFN-mediated resistance to viral infection in vitro is dependent on the inhibition of viral replication (Samuel, 2001). In our manuscript we found overpression ATP1B3 inhibited EV71 growth, and this inhibition could be effectively abolished by type I IFNs antibodies in the cell culture. Our data suggests that ATP1B3 inhibits the replication of EV71by inducing the production of type I IFNs.",
