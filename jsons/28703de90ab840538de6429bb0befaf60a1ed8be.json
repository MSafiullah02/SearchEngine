Due to the suddenness and unpredictability of these events, they often have different degrees of influence on the individual's mental state and can even result in a psychological crisis. As a special group, children are more vulnerable to intrusion and influence because their mental and physical development is not yet mature. If their psychological response to a crisis is not managed promptly and effectively, it can seriously affect their development in terms of mental health and even have long-term effects throughout their lifetime. This article will introduce the current state of development of methods to safeguard children's mental health in China and describe some standard family intervention methods.",

At the same time, children of different ages have different reactions; for example, preschool children often feel helpless and anxious when facing disasters. They often show a loss of previously acquired development skills (regressive behavior), such as thumb sucking, bedwetting, fear of the dark or of animals, sticking to parents, fear of the night, urinary incontinence, constipation, difficulty in speaking (such as stuttering), and loss of appetite. School-age children may repeatedly discuss disaster events or describe themselves as being severely troubled by fear or sadness. Clinically, they show irritability, crying, stickiness, aggressive behavior, competing with siblings for parental attention, fear of the night and dark, nightmares, truancy, and loss of interest in or inability to concentrate on work. In the face of disasters, adolescents often show sleep disorders, loss of appetite, overt rebellious behaviors, and unwillingness to do things, which may become problematic at school. They often exhibit behaviors such as fighting, losing interest, seeking attention, and experience many physical problems, such as headaches, unexplained limb pains, rashes, and problems with excretion, and often lose interest in participating in social activities with peers.",

A psychological crisis refers to a state of psychological imbalance when individuals encounter an emergency or face major setbacks and difficulties, which they can neither avoid nor resolve by using their own resources and coping methods. When an individual encounters a significant problem or change that is difficult to manage and resolve, their mental balance will be broken, normal life will be disturbed, and inner tension will continue to accumulate, leading to feelings of helplessness and even disorders of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This state of imbalance is a state of crisis. This crisis arises because the individual realizes that an event or situation exceeds their ability to cope, not because of the event the individual has experienced itself.",

The study of crisis intervention for children is still at the theoretical level, and there is a lack of practical skills for dealing with children in crisis. The processes of child crisis intervention are incomplete and short-term now. Children's psychological crisis intervention is long-term and heavy-duty, which not only depends on the efforts of psychologists but also requires the joint efforts of parents, teachers, and all members of society. Although the experience of some developed countries can be used for reference, China's national conditions are different from those of other countries, there is an urgent need to establish a working system for children's psychological crisis intervention suited to China's national conditions and characteristics.",

The most crucial step in managing emotions is to be able to identify one's various emotions and to label each emotion accurately. The more emotions a child can recognize, the more clearly and accurately they can express them. This is the beginning of dealing with emotions. If they can express themselves, they can communicate and think of a way to address the crisis. Sometimes the emotions are resolved when they are expressed.",
