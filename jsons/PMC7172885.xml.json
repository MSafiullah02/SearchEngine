However, upon determining the effects of in ovo (i.o.) and s.c. injections on hatchability, mortality, feed consumption and conversion, processing live BW, and condemnations, Gildersleeve et al. (1993) surmised that administration of the MD vaccine by i.o. injection results in reduced settlement costs and is safe and efficacious. Accordingly, 98 to 99% of broilers in the US poultry industry are currently vaccinated for MD by i.o. injection (Johnston et al., 1997; Jochemsen and Jeurissen, 2002).",

Also, in comparison to s.c. injection, i.o. injection did not have a significantly different effect on total and yolk-free BW, body length, or body mass index at placement, or on total and yolk-free BW at 7 d post-hatch. However, in comparison to non-injected controls, higher body lengths and lower body mass indices resulted in the hatchlings that had received i.o. injections. In a later companion report, Peebles et al. (2017) additionally noted that the 14 to 28 d of age (doa) feed consumption and 14 to 21 doa BW gain of birds belonging to the i.o. treatment group was greater in comparison to those belonging to the s.c. treatment group.",

Delayed pht has also been associated with dehydration and an inadequate supply of energy (Vieira and Moran, 1999b). Franco et al. (2006) showed that as the pht of broiler chicks was increased in 12 h intervals up to 48 h, that there was a linear reduction in their live BW and feed intake. Vieira and Moran (1999a) have noted that a reduction in the BW gain of broilers subjected to a 24 h pht was sustained through market age (49 doa), and it has been advocated that the inability of rats to attain normal BW is associated with a depression in their muscle development (Elliott et al., 1943). In the study by Peebles et al. (2016), it was also reported that prolonging pht by 14 h was unfavorable to the early chick quality of Ross 708 broilers. A decrease in BW at 7 doa also resulted by extending pht an additional 14 h. Furthermore, in the later companion report by Peebles et al. (2017), it was shown that in response to an increase in pht from 4 to 18 h, a decrease in post-hatch BW gain through 35 doa was associated with a reduction in feed consumption through 28 doa.",

(2017) to have no significant effect on mean BW at each of the weekly age periods, there were significant integrated responses of feed consumption and BW gain to moa in the various age intervals examined. The 14 to 28 d feed consumption and 14 to 21 d BW gain of s.c.-vaccinated birds was lower than that of i.o.-vaccinated birds. Previous reports directly comparing effects of i.o. and s.c. administration of the MD vaccine on broiler processing yield are lacking in the literature. In the current study, relative tenders muscles weight was greater at 49 doa in the birds that received i.o injections in comparison to those that received s.c. injections. This may be related to the increased feed consumption and BW gain noted in those birds between 14 and 28 doa by Peebles et al. (2017). The noted isolated effect on the tenders muscle group, exclusive of the other processing variables examined, is difficult to explain. However, it is noteworthy that Peebles et al. (2014) also showed that the incubational characteristics of Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs was associated with relative tenders muscle yield at 49 d post-hatch. These results nevertheless suggest that although i.o. vaccination displays some potential advantage over s.c. injection of the MD vaccine, these moa basically have no differential effects on the processing yield of Ross 708 broilers.",

Oliveira et al.

Peebles et al. (2017) further showed that an increase in pht from 4 to 18 h significantly reduced the BW of the Ross 708 broilers at placement (d 0) as well as on d 7, 14, 21, and 35, and further noted that there were likewise significant integrated responses of feed consumption and BW gain to pht in the various post-hatch age intervals examined. The increase in pht from 4 to 18 h decreased feed consumption through 28 d post-hatch and BW gain through 35 d post-hatch. Peebles et al.

Joseph and Moran (2005) reported that prolonging the pht of male and female Ross 308 broilers in the hatcher from 3 to 15 h exerted no major effects on their subsequent grow-out performance or their carcass qualities and breast meat yields. However, a 24 h pht without access to feed and water has been reported to eventually reduce the slaughter carcass weight and percentage of grade A carcasses of male Ross 308 broilers (Vieira and Moran, 1999a). The results of this current study are similar to those of Joseph and Moran (2005). Despite noted adverse effects on broiler performance through 35 doa post-hatch, a delay of up to 18 h was observed to have no negative impact on processing yield. Conversely, increasing the delay up to 24 h pht may be deleterious to processing yield and carcass quality. It is suggested that such a delay would negatively impact the yield in Ross 708 broilers, as has been shown by Vieira and Moran (1999a) for Ross 308 broilers. Further research would be needed to confirm this suggestion.",

The corresponding results of this study and that of Peebles et al. (2014), concerning tenders muscle yield at 49 d post-hatch, also confirm that the early subjection of broilers to various physiological challenges can ultimately affect processing yield. In addition, there were no interactive effects observed between moa of the MD vaccine and pht. Although prolonging pht by 14 h reduced BW gain through 35 d in association with the reduction in feed consumption through 28 d, because there was no interaction between moa and pht for any of the processing yield variables examined, it may also be concluded that an increase in pht from 4 to 18 h does not exacerbate the effect of administering the MD vaccine to Ross 708 broilers by either i.o. or s.c. injection. In light of the results of the current investigation, effects of the i.o. administration of vaccines for other viral diseases of major concern to poultry producers including avian influenza, Newcastle disease, and coronaviruses on subsequent processing yield deserve further investigation.",
