All human caliciviruses remain as candidates because it has proved difficult to grow them in cell cultures and consequently many of the typical properties of viruses in the group have not been demonstrated. This situation is exacerbated by the existence of several other viruses which do not show the characteristic virus morphology in the electron microscope (EM), but are likely nevertheless to belong to this virus family. The purpose of this review is to put into context those calciviruses significant in human disease. Of necessity this must be based on the characteristics of established group members and a review of the animal viruses is therefore appropriate. Characteristics of established and candidate caliciviruses are summarised in Table 1 .",

However, in 1972 a calicivirus was isolated from lesions on the flippers of a sealion on San Miguel island, California. This was later termed San Miguel sealion virus (SMSV) and similar viruses have since been isolated from a variety of marine animals including fish, pinnipeds and whales. Antibody to the virus is common in marine mammals living in, or passing through, the area. Antibodies to SMSV were also found in some land animals including potential scavengers such as foxes, and the virus was also obtained from a fish preyed on by sealions thus raising the possibility that SMSV could be transmitted through food.' SMSV is serologically distinct from vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV), but the viruses are clearly related by RNA homology, and are also similar in terms of the cells in which the virus can replicate in culture. Unlike other caliciviruses which have a relatively narrow host range, SMSV ' Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. can infect a variety of species including primates, and can also produce symptoms of vesicular exanthema when inoculated into pigs. Consequently it is possible that VESV spread to pigs through feed contaminated with viruses from marine sources. Indeed, SMSV has been isolated from animal feed containing fur seal meat.'",

This virus was later shown to be ubiquitous in cat populations, and is the second largest cause (after feline herpesvirus) of feline upper respiratory tract infection serious enough to cause owners to seek veterinary attention for their animals. Infection is associated with a superficial vesiculation and ulceration predominantly of the oral cavity. Some strains of virus are associated with the development of a polyarthritis (limping syndrome), although the reasons for this are not clear. Respiratory infection is milder than that caused by feline herpesvirus, and unless complicated by secondary bacterial invasion, recovery is usually uneventful. However, the virus is able to establish a persistent infection in some animals which may become life-long carriers, with continuous shedding of the virus. The tonsils are likely to be the major, but not the only, site for viral persistence. Levels of virus antigen in tonsil tissue are low compared with the amount of virus shed, and tonsillectomy does not cure a persistent i n f e~t i o n .~,~",

This appearance (described in more detail later) remains the simplest and most obvious criterion by which caliciviruses can be identified. In 1976, Madeley and Cosgrove' observed particles of this characteristic morphology in the stools of infants suffering from diarrhoea by direct EM (Figure I) . As with other enteric viruses, these particles were also found in the stools of symptom-free infants. Human caliciviruses have since been linked with cases of mild diarrhoea in both infants and children, from all over the world and shown to induce illness in volunteer studies. Originally these agents were referred to as human calicivirus, and abbreviated to Accepted 30 June 1991 HCV. However, this term has now become established for reference to hepatitis C virus. In order to avoid confusion, we will refer to these human caliciviruses as HuCV in this review.",

By comparison, the calicivirus surface has an array of dark stain-filled hollows giving a lacy appearance. There are 32 such hollows, located at each apex (12) and face (20) of a regular icosahedron and each is separated from its neighbours by an unstained ridge (Figure 3 ) . These cup-like hollows give the virus group its name (calyx = a cup) and form very characteristic patterns when viewed along the two-, three-or five-fold axes of symmetry (Figure 3) . Along the two-fold symmetry axis, four dark patches are seen, often in a pronounced rhomboid or diamond pattern, Seen along the three-fold axis, a central dark patch is surrounded by six others, a pattern which is unique to the caliciviruses and often seen as a star of David ( Figure 3b ).",

The illness lasts from 1-11 days and is paralleled by the period for which virus is detectable in the stools. Other infections, mainly those associated with strains UK 3 and 4, affect individuals of all ages and the disease pattern is very similar to that of the SRSVs (see below). Disease patterns induced by caliciviruses and SRSVs are similar when infections in the same age group are compared. Antibody to HuCVs is acquired during the first 5 years of life in places as diverse as the UK, Saudi Arabia and Japan. Levels of seropositivity reach SOYO in the 6-12 year age group, suggesting that exposure at least to some serotypes of the virus is common.

The nomenclature used is mainly geographical and several outbreaks of HuCV and SRSV have been reported from the same city (Sapporo). Furthermore, systematic names used in Japan and the UK (SRSV-1,2, etc) are not compatible, and the source of each virus must be specified. However, it is possible to assemble the data into groups of presumptive similarity (but not, by any means, identity) as illustrated in Table 3 . This analysis of the reports suggests that there are four distinct groups of similar viruses reported from several sources. There are no data addressing a comparison of SRSV-Japan I and 2 with SRSV-UKI. However, since SRSV-Japan 1 and 2 are distinct from SRSV-Japan numbers 3-9, and from each other, they cannot both be classified with UKI. Consequently we can deduce 5-6 such virus groups in total.",

Not all rises in titre were associated with episodes of diarrhoea. Most of the increases in serum titre took place between the ages of 14-36 months.23 Broadly similar results were obtained in studies performed in Ecuador and the phi lip pine^.^^^^^ Volunteers infected with Norwalk virus commonly develop vomiting and diarrhoea, often associated with headache and abdominal discomfort.26 Illness generally lasts 24-48 hours. Norwalk virus infection causes flattening and broadening of the jejunal villi similar to that caused by other diarrhoea-associated viruses. There is also mucosal inflammation and crypt hypertrophy during repair.27r28 However, these changes occurred even in the absence of diarrhoea, and were accompanied by decreased levels of brush border enzymes and malabsorption of fats and x y l o~e .

First, it has been postulated that there is a natural genetic resistance (or susceptibility) to Nonvalk virus infection in some cases. There is some evidence of familial clusters of disease within populations exposed similarly to the virus which would support such a hypothesis.31 An alternative suggestion proposes that multiple sequential challenge with the virus is required before any individual can succumb to infection and begin to build up antibody titre. This suggestion would explain why infections appear to be mild in persons with lower levels of antibody, and why prevalence of antibody eventually reaches such high levels.",

These are believed to be the end products of the proteolytic protein processing pathways. The M , 62 OOO protein forms the capsid of the progeny virus and is synthesised in greatest amount. Under conditions which inhibit proteolytic processing, additional molecules can be detected. These comprise two large proteins (Mr 125 000 and 123 ooo), and two which are smaller (M, 98 000 and 76 000). Only one of these four proteins has been characterised.
