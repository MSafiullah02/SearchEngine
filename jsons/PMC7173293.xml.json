Despite mass vaccination, avian influenza (AIV), avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV1) (i.e. Newcastle disease viruses, NDV) and avian coronaviruses (ACoV) (i.e. infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) are regarded as the most important avian viruses that are causing serious economic losses, trade restrictions, and food security issues in the poultry industries. Vaccinations are being applied in domestic poultry to achieve high standards of poultry production, control viral infections and to reduce economic losses [1]. The impacts of these vaccines on the interface between domestic and wild bird population are incompletely studied especially when intensive poultry farming are being practiced under poor biosecurity settings.",

However, intensive vaccines application, contamination of the environment with infectious material through disposal or re-use of poultry litter and due to close contacts between wild birds and commercial poultry may lead to reversal of spillover (reverse spillover) from farmed poultry to wild birds [3]. Likewise, the transmission of virulent (e.g. escape mutant) viruses that have evolved either in response to vaccine pressure or through undetected viral contaminants within commercial vaccines are being transmitted to wild birds [2]. In high-tech commercial poultry farming, the possibility of spillover scenario into wild birds can be mitigated by the strict biosecurity measures. However, backyard poultry rearing meliorates these contacts especially in agriculture-enriched countries [4].",

In the present study, considering all preliminary evidences on the presence of live vaccines in wild birds [5], [6], we examined the hypothesis that APMV1 and ACoV vaccines may spill into wild birds. To this end, we performed virus surveillance in the Egyptian wild birds, and assessed the magnitude of ACoV and APMV1 prevalence in the country. The sequenced data from identified strains of APMV1 and ACoV from Egyptian wild birds were assessed along with the previously reported data in public domains on the vaccine-derived APMV1 and ACoV strains. Cumulative data indicates that ACoV and APMV1 vaccine strains can be identified in wild birds that are housed in the vicinity of commercial poultry farms. These viral vaccine-strains isolated from wild birds have shown significant genetic similarities with the vaccine strains being applied in the commercial poultry farms suggesting the possible reverse spillover of these viruses to nearby wild life. These findings highlight the need to fully investigate the dynamics and spectrum of vaccine-derived viral strains in wild birds and that such virus detection would severely jeopardise the welfare of the wild birds and may in future leads to virus evolution with increased virulence, as has been proposed for avian influenza viruses [1], [2].",

Appropriate positive and negative controls were included, and positive samples were back-screened to exclude the possibility of laboratory- and/or cross-contamination. Amplicons were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and desired bands were excised and purified using the QuickClean II Gel Extraction Kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Nucleotide sequencing and assembly were performed as described previously [13]. DNA sequencing was performed with BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA).

Phylogenetic trees were constructed utilizing the obtained nucleotide sequences for F and S1 genes of APMV1 and ACoV, respectively based on Bayesian Inference within the program MrBayes version 3.1.2 [15]. Two independent Markov chain Monte Carlo were executed and sampled every 1000 generations using the default parameters of the priors\u2019 panel. The analysis was based on the GTR + I + G model, which allow significantly changed posterior probability estimates. To confirm the Bayesian tree topologies, phylogenetic relationship was also established with the MEGA version 6.0 software program using the maximum likelihood method with the Kimura two-parameter model [16]. The evolutionary distances were inferred using the pairwise distance method and expressed as the number of nucleotide substitutions per site giving a statistical significance of the tree topology by 1000 bootstrap resampling of the data [16].",

Thus most attentions of diagnostic laboratories have been to identify pathogenic or virulent isolates whereas avirulent strains are potentially ignored. Although our data do not allow for the identification of the direct sources of APMV1 and ACoV infection for the wild birds, it is reasonable to suggest that these wild bird isolates originated from recent spillover of live APMV1 and ACoV vaccines, instead of representing strains that naturally circulate in these birds. Spillover of APMV1 and ACoV vaccines into wild birds reflects the most commonly used live vaccines. In addition, LaSota is the most commonly used APMV1 vaccine [22] and is more likely to be shed in the environment.",

Proper mitigation of these factors will not only increase the wild-domesticated interface but will also alleviate the disease and stress burdens on wild-life. In conclusion, further studies are required to evaluate ecological impacts of transmission of vaccines or infectious agents from poultry operations into free-ranging avifauna. Since the identified APMV-1 and ACoV isolates from wild birds were closely related to the currently used commercial vaccines in the Egyptian poultry sectors, the extensive use of vaccines poses possible threat into wildlife. Intensified surveillance of wild birds is an important means of assessing the relative prevalence of avian vaccine strains, and this knowledge would aid risk assessments, and disease management. Moreover, our findings are fundamental to assess the poor biosecurity measures, possible threats for virus evolution in these asymptomatic birds, and the impact of such spillover on the ecology and survival of wild birds and provide insights into the reverse spillover of avian viral vaccine strains in wild birds, which are considered reservoirs for these viruses. These findings highlight the need to fully investigate the dynamics and spectrum of vaccine-derived viral strains in the wild birds. Such investigations would be helpful to ameliorate the welfare of wild birds and may reduce the possible virus evolution in potentially asymptomatic hosts. Likewise, bio-security measures should be enhanced to reduce the escape of vaccine strains to wild birds and disease transmission from domesticated to wild birds and vice versa.",
