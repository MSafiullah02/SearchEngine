            "text": "Domestic dogs are a primary vector of rabies in many countries, and the disease claims approximately 55,000 human lives annually worldwide, primarily in Africa and Asia (Knobel et al., 2005). Vaccination is an effective way to prevent rabies in domestic dogs, but there are numerous factors that contribute to a lack of vaccination in some areas. Failure to vaccinate can often be attributed to cost, lack of interest, availability of vaccine, and cultural differences in ownership practices (Bergman et al., 2008). It is estimated that on tribal lands in the United States, less than 20% of the domestic dogs are vaccinated against rabies (Bergman et al., 2008). This has implications for human health as approximately 1000 dog bites are reported annually on the Navajo Nation (Daniels, 1986).",

In 1994, an outbreak of rabies in domestic dogs with subsequent spillover to coyotes (Canis latrans) forced a statewide health emergency and quarantine in Texas (Clark and Wilson, 1995). Widespread ORV programs have since led to eradication of the canine strain of rabies in the United States (Slate et al., 2005, Slate et al., 2009), but unvaccinated domestic animals are still susceptible to infection by rabies strains found in wildlife. Furthermore, affordable domestic dog vaccination programs in developing nations are lacking (Kaare et al., 2009, Tang et al., 2005).",

All dogs were either surrendered by owners to the Animal Control facility or were captured as feral dogs by Animal Control Officers. A licensed veterinarian (SB) performed a physical examination of all dogs before selection. The first 13 healthy dogs (7 males, 5 females, and 1 unrecorded) that became available were included in the study. Any overtly aggressive dog or a dog with medical issues requiring extensive treatment (i.e., tumors and so on) was excluded. Any dog showing overt symptoms of disease (i.e., symptoms compatible with canine parvovirus infection, canine distemper, tumors, fever, injuries, and so on) were excluded from participation in the study. No advanced diagnostics (i.e., complete blood count and so on) were performed as the objective of the study was to be representative of the free-roaming population. All dogs accepted into the study were vaccinated for canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, adenovirus type 2, coronavirus, and parainfluenza. Testing for heartworm was not necessary as it is not present in the Navajo Nation. All dogs received a broad-spectrum deworming treatment and treatment specifically for tapeworm infection. Because only approximately 50% of the dogs were accustomed to human handling, dogs were grouped (no more than 2 per group) and kenneled by behavior toward the other dogs for 2 weeks to acclimate to other dogs and the presence of humans. Dogs ranged in age from 6 months to 4 years, based strictly on dental wear and condition and body condition score (BCS) ranged from 2 to 5 (maximum: 10). No dog was excluded owing to low BCS. Dogs were housed in kennels consisting of an indoor and outdoor section that were joined by a sliding door used to separate co-kenneled dogs during individual bait trials. Kennel dimensions (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height) were 2.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.5 m3 and 1.8 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 2.2 m3 for the indoor and outdoor sections, respectively. Dogs were fed a daily ration of commercial dog food (\u201cOl\u2019 Roy, Adult;\u201d Wal-Mart, Bentonville, AR), with water available ad libitum. Dogs were housed at the shelter for total of 6 weeks.",

All bait flavors were manufactured by Artemis Technologies, Inc., and the recipes are proprietary. A total of 7 flavors were evaluated: bacon, cheese, dog food flavor, hazelnut, sugar-vanilla, peanut butter, and sardine.

Baits were offered at 09:00 and 15:00 hours with an additional offering at 12:00 hours on the final trial day.

In our study, peanut butter flavor did not differ in preference when compared with sugar-vanilla flavor, but the borderline statistical result (P\n = 0.051) may be a function of relatively small sample sizes. Hazelnut performed nearly as poorly as sugar-vanilla flavored bait. Although many dogs tend to show a preference for sugars such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose (Ferrell, 1984, Houpt et al., 1979), our results suggest that sweet-tasting flavors such as sugar-vanilla flavor or hazelnut may not be suitable for use in the ONRAB\u00ae Ultralite bait matrix for domestic dogs.",

            "text": "Dog food flavor was selected first more often than all other bait types. This result may be confounded by the study subjects' familiarity with commercial dog food as their daily food source, although different brands were used as the daily ration (\u201cOl\u2019 Roy Adult\u201d) and in the bait matrix formulation (Iams, Mason, OH). The apparent preference of dog food flavor may also be a function of access to commercial dog food by feral dogs through intentional or unintentional (food left out for kept dogs) feeding. In our study, bacon, cheese, and sardine flavors were selected with a similar frequency as dog food. Interestingly, Linhart et al. (2002) found that other canids also preferred cheese- and fish-flavored baits. Thus, dog food, bacon, cheese, or sardine may be equally suitable flavor matrix choices for domestic dog ORV baiting on the Navajo Nation. However, caution must be exercised when making inferences to other regions. In developing nations, feral dog diets range from human waste and animal carcasses in Zimbabwe (Butler and du Toit, 2002), invertebrates and small mammals in Brazil (Campos et al., 2007), and human-derived garbage in India (Vanak and Gompper, 2009). Selection of an appropriate bait flavor for ORV applications in developing nations may be site specific and requires further investigation.",
