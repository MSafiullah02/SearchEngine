Microchip CE analysis of renal markers has been integrated with electrochemical detection (46)(47). One method was based on coupling of enzymatic bioassays using creatininase, creatinase, and sarcosine oxidase and electrophoretic separation and amperometric detection of reaction products (46). Gold-coated thick-film electrodes were used for the amperometric detection, and detection limits of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mol/L (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) were reported. An alternative method enabled direct measurement of the renal markers by pulsed amperometry for the detection of nitrogen-containing compounds and more easily oxidized uric acid (47). Four renal markers (creatine, creatinine, p-aminohippuric acid, and uric acid) were readily measured within 5 min. A creatinine:creatine ratio was determined in <2 min (compared with \u223c20 min with conventional creatinine analysis methods). The microchip CE device allowed rapid, simple, and economical renal function testing. These devices have substantial potential advantages for decentralized clinical testing and point-of-care testing. Further developments to integrate additional functions (e.g., on-chip filtering of biological fluids) to analyze serum samples, and to perform parallel and multiple runs on a single-chip platform could enhance the acceptance of microchip CE for use in high-throughput clinical microanalyzers.",

Because the hybridization step is eliminated, the real-time, quantitative, fluorescence-based PCR assay also has the advantage of rapid analysis, but expensive instrumentation is required for this approach.

Nevertheless, it was possible to unambiguously distinguish patient serum samples with increased IgG (35.5 g/L in one patient with chronic infection and 64.7 g/L in another patient with myeloma) from those with IgG concentrations within the reference interval (8\u201316 g/L).",

DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. Carriers of the disease are identified by the detection of duplicated or deleted exons in the gene (72)(73)(74). The deletions/duplications associated with DMD tend to be located at certain regions of the gene, making the diagnosis of DMD (and the related, less severe Becker muscular dystrophy) a straightforward process involving analysis of a limited number of PCR-amplified DNA fragments (72)(73)(74). An integrated microdevice for infrared-mediated PCR amplifications directly coupled to microchip CE DNA separations was developed for this purpose. In this approach, infrared radiation directly heats the PCR mixture rather than heating the microchip (72), allowing fast temperature cycling and shorter analysis time. Unfortunately, separation efficiency was hampered by heating of the microchip sieving matrix buffer solution during PCR cycling. Because heating is integral to PCR, this problem must be solved before this approach can become useful. Nevertheless, PCR-CE provided considerable savings in time, labor, and materials compared with traditional methods (e.g., Southern blot). Solution of the heating problem could make feasible a fully integrated diagnostic device for genetic diseases based on microchip CE.",

The sheath-flow design minimized interferences of the detection system from electrophoresis potentials. Unlike optical detection systems, the electrochemical detector is easier to miniaturize because bulky optical components (i.e., light source, lens, and filters) are not required. The use of multiple electrodes may make this system a portable micro total-analysis system for analyzing complex analyte mixtures. A semiautomated sample preparation, amplification, and electrophoretic separation platform has also been developed for analysis of human genomic DNA to detect hereditary and infectious diseases based on microchannel CE with 2-color optical detection (excitation wavelengths at 488 and 532 nm). Two-base pair resolution of single-stranded DNA was achieved in the analysis of PCR products from leukocyte lysates (76).",

The most commonly available features of conventional and microchip CE are compared in Table 2 . Microchip CE has some disadvantages compared with conventional CE, such as lower peak capacity because of the shorter separation channels and a lack of compatibility with versatile ultraviolet detectors because microchip fabrication materials are typically not transparent to ultraviolet light. Important advantages of microchip CE, however, include rapid analysis (typically \u223c10 times faster) and easy integration of sample preparation and derivatization steps, which allow further reduction of analysis time and labor costs. Because cost and speed are crucial concerns for modern clinical analysis, these advantages are expected to become more important when new generations of commercial microchip CE systems become available, and eventually microchip CE may overtake conventional CE as the technology continues to mature.",

            "text": "Although microchip CE is still in the early stages of development, the technique has already shown applicability in many areas of clinical analysis. Compared with conventional techniques, microchip CE\u2013based molecular diagnostic methods have demonstrated advantages in terms of analysis speed, cost savings, and detection sensitivity. As this review has shown, there is already a rapidly growing collection of new applications based on microchip CE. At the same time, many on-column preconcentration methods have been developed to improve detection sensitivity in CE separations that are readily transferable to the microchip CE format (79)(80). With the introduction of highly automated, high-throughput commercial instrumentation, microchip CE is likely to replace many of the complex and slower analytical systems used in routine analyses. Further improvements in automation and an increase in sample throughput along with development of new testing protocols and enhancement of detection sensitivity for certain analytes could make microchip CE systems key instruments for clinical analyses.",
