These numbers suggest that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) may not simply be effete materials, and they, like their protein counterparts, may play significant functional roles [3].",

            "text": "Of these two RNA groups, sncRNAs are transcripts that are <200 nt in length. Housekeeping RNAs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) (5S, 5.8S), fall within this noncoding category [7]. The first characterized ncRNAs, tRNAs, serve as adaptors between messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins for the elongation of polypeptide; rRNAs are essential elements for protein translation [8], [9]. Other sncRNAs include small nucleolar RNAs and small nuclear (snRNAs) that play certain roles in rRNA modification and RNA splicing [10], [11]. Besides these entities, sncRNAs also include three major types of regulatory RNAs: piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [12], [13]. Of these regulatory RNAs, piRNAs are involved in the regulation of transposon activity and chromatin state in germline and somatic cells [14], [15]; miRNAs and cell endogenous siRNAs contribute to RNA interference (RNAi) or post-transcriptional gene silencing [16]. Approximately 2000 miRNAs are encoded by the human genome [17], [18]; miRNAs serve as guide RNAs in an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to target mRNAs through imperfect complementarity leading to repression of translation or degradation of the mRNAs [19], [20], [21]. Similarly, cell endogenous siRNAs also participate with RISC proteins in silencing gene expression usually via perfect complementarity with mRNA targets [22]. The functional roles of sncRNAs have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [12], [18], [23], [24], [25], [26]. This current review focuses on the still less well-studied counterpart of sncRNAs and lncRNAs, and their interactions with viruses.",

            "text": "The lncRNAs are transcripts that are >200 nt in length [5]. This class of RNAs includes intergenic ncRNAs, pseudogene transcripts, and many antisense RNAs [5], [6]. The majority of lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II; they are 5\u2032-capped, spliced, and polyadenylated, and are mRNA-like in many ways [27]. A small minority of lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III; these include 7SK and 7SL\n[28], [29]. The 21A lncRNA is also an RNA Pol-III transcript, but it is not polyadenylated [30]. Additionally, several other features frequently define lncRNAs, such as epigenetic marks shared with protein-coding gene (H3K4me3 at the gene promoter and H3K36me3 throughout the gene body), splicing of multiple exons via canonical splice site motifs, regulation by transcription factors, and expression in a tissue-specific manner [6]. It is now increasingly understood that lncRNA sequences are abundant in the mammalian genome. To date, approximately 6700 lncRNAs have been identified in the human genome [31], [32], and it is estimated that 7000\u201323,000 lncRNAs putatively exist in the human genome [33], [34]. Whether many of these deduced lncRNAs are authentically expressed and serve functional roles remain to be demonstrated. As of November 2012, 194 lncRNAs have been recorded in the lncRNAdb, a database that archives lncRNAs reported in published literature [35].",

Since the functions of lncRNAs are highly pleiotropic, ranging from gene regulation to sncRNA precursors [4] and from cell development to cancer growth [6], [12], it is not surprising that lncRNAs may be involved in virus replication. Early studies of the relationship between ncRNAs and viruses mainly focused on sncRNAs, such as miRNAs [63], [64], while the roles of lncRNAs were not well studied. However, there is emerging evidence that cellular lncRNA expression can be regulated by virus infection. Thus, whole transcriptome analyses showed that during an infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, approximately 500 annotated lncRNAs and 1000 nonannotated genomic regions are differentially expressed in lung samples, and 40% of these changes are similarly observed during influenza virus infection and interferon treatment, indicating that many lncRNAs may be involved in regulating the host response to virus infection [65]. A concordant interpretation was separately proposed based on findings that the expression patterns of eight mRNA-like lncRNAs in immune tissues of chickens were changed after Marek's disease virus infection, similarly suggesting that they may play a role in host immune response [66]. Another example is PRINS (psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress), which is increased by herpes simplex virus infection [67]. Separately, we recently profiled 83 disease-related lncRNAs in HIV-1-infected T cells and identified several lncRNAs that were changed in both Jurkat and MT4 cells, e.g., BIC, NEAT1, and PANDA\n[68].Our findings are also consistent with the overall notion that some lncRNAs serve in host responses to viral infections. Finally, studies have found a non-protein-coding infection-specific gene family called Pinci1, which is upregulated by Phytophthora infestans infection, in potatoes [69].",

Interestingly, 7SL has been suggested to participate as a cofactor in the innate antiviral function of host cytidine deaminases such as cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) [78], [79]. Wang et al [78] demonstrated that A3G selectively interacts with 7SL RNAs and both are incorporated into virions, while A3G mutants that reduce 7SL RNA binding but maintain wild-type levels of mRNA and tRNA binding are packaged poorly and have impaired antiviral activity. Reducing 7SL RNA packaging by overexpression of SRP19 proteins inhibits 7SL RNA, and A3G and A3F virion packaging, and impairs their antiviral functions [78], [79]. Moreover, virion packaging of both A3G and cellular 7SL RNA was mapped to the same regions in the HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) domain [77].",

More recently, BIC was found to be the precursor of oncogenic miR-155\n[86], which is induced by several oncogenic viruses, e.g., Epstein\u2013Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, and reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T [87], [88], [89]. Interestingly, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, a gammaherpesvirus, and Marek's disease virus, an avian alphaherpesvirus, encode viral miRNAs, miR-K11, and miR-M4, as functional orthologs of miR-155\n[90], [91]. Of interest, it has been shown that Epstein\u2013Barr virus attenuates NF-\u03baB signaling and stabilizes latent virus persistence by inducing miR-155\n[92]. In hepatitis C virus infection, upregulated miR-155 has been demonstrated to promote hepatocarcinogenesis by activating Wnt signaling [88]. Reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T induces miR-155 to target JARID2, a cell-cycle regulator that is a part of a histone methyltransferase complex, in order to promote cell survival [89]. Induction of miR-155 by virus infection may not only be due to the induction of BIC RNA, but also arise from enhanced RNA processing [93].",

Recent research has shown that some lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in HBV-related HCCs. Two of these lncRNAs, lncRNA-HEIH (lncRNA high expression in HCC) and HULC (lncRNA highly upregulated in liver cancer), are reported to play key roles in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis [95], [96]. Of these two lncRNAs, lncRNA-HEIH was reported to play a key role in G0/G1 arrest and be associated with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2, an important subunit of the PRC2 complex), resulting in the repression of EZH2 target genes [95]. The other lncRNA HULC, a \u223c500 nt mRNA-like ncRNA, was reported to be upregulated by the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein through activation of the HULC promoter via cAMP responsive element binding protein. Upregulated HULC promotes proliferation of hepatoma cells through suppressing a tumor suppressor gene p18\n[96].",

More recently, an ncRNA Tmevpg1 (Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus persistence candidate gene 1) was identified, at that locus through a positional cloning approach, as a candidate gene for controlling the persistence of Theiler's virus [98]. The promoter of Tmevpg1 contains binding sites for E2A and the Ets family of transcription factors, indicating that it is regulated by transcription factors involved in the immune system [99]. Since Tmevpg1 and its human ortholog, TMEVPG1, are located in a cluster of cytokine genes that includes the genes for gamma interferon and homologs of interleukin-10, Tmevpg1 is suggested to be involved in the control of Interferon-gammagene (Ifng) expression [98]. However, its precise role requires further characterization.",

However, recently, by Northwestern screening of a human cDNA library with a \u03b22.7 probe, Reeves et al [109] found that \u03b22.7 binds directly to the mitochondrial enzyme complex I (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\u2013ubiquinone oxidoreductase). This binding protects virus-infected cells from apoptosis and results in continued adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which is critical for the successful completion of the viral life cycle. The \u03b22.7 RNA can also protect rat aortic endothelial cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced apoptosis by reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species [113].",

            "text": "The subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), 0.3\u20130.5 kb, is derived from the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the RNA genome of flaviviruses, a large group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that includes several human pathogenic viruses, such as yellow fever virus, JEV, and West Nile virus (WNV) [101], [114], [115]. The sfRNA has been demonstrated to be produced from the incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the host 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease XRN1. The rigid secondary structure stem-loop II located at the beginning of the 3\u2032-UTR of the above viral genomes is resistant to nuclease XRN1 degradation and results in the production of sfRNA\n[116]. Production of sfRNA has been shown to increase the replication efficiency of WNVs and is important for virus-induced cytopathicity in cell culture and also for viral pathogenicity in mice [110], [117]. However, the exact mechanisms explaining how sfRNA leads to increased virus replication and cell death remain elusive. sfRNA is also found in JEV infection. In this setting, sfRNA becomes apparent at the time during which minus-strand RNA (antigenome) reaches a plateau, suggesting a role for sfRNA in the regulation of antigenome synthesis. The presence of sfRNA may inhibit antigenome synthesis and may exert a negative effect on JEV translation [118].",

This new capability has driven the discovery of an increasing number of lncRNAs. Nonetheless, our knowledge regarding the functions of these lncRNA transcripts remains quite limited [119]. Because lncRNAs have diverse functions, they likely represent important bioentities that merit further investigation. Here, we have focused on a few examples of lncRNAs, including cellular and viral lncRNAs. Our brief survey shows that we are at the initial stages of uncovering their functions and their relationships with viruses. This review is meant to serve as a brief illustrative introduction to lncRNAs, which we hope may spur interest by readers for conducting further studies on these interesting and important biomolecules.",

(A) The cytidinedeaminase APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F selectively interact with 7SL RNAs and are incorporated into virions. (B) The lncRNA NEAT1 serves as a structural scaffold for the nuclear substructure paraspeckles. Paraspeckle proteins PSF and p54nrb bind to HIV-1 RNA and retain the RNA in paraspeckles. (C) The integrated ALV activates bic gene expression by promoter insertion. BIC RNA, the precursor of miR-155, is suggested to be responsible for virus-induced lymphomas. (D) The lncRNA-HEIH, which is highly expressed in HBV-related HCC, recruits the PRC2 complex to repress EZH2 (an important subunit of the PRC2 complex) targeted genes.
