            "text": "Soon after tobacco was introduced into Europe as an ornamental plant, it came to be regarded as a remarkable medicinal plant. Spanish sailors and the chroniclers of the Indies observed and recorded the widespread use of tobacco. They were impressed by the esteem with which it was held by the natives of the New World. Tobacco played a very important role in the mystical, social and medical rituals of the American natives. Based on the medical applications of the herb by the natives, European herbalists believed that most herbs of the New World possessed some medicinal virtues. By the end of the 16th century, tobacco was in widespread use in Europe to treat a variety of diseases. Some medical authorities popularized tobacco as a panacea for treating over 65 different ailments. Over time, excessive use of tobacco led to the first great well-documented \u201cdrug\" controversy. Awareness of the inability to give up smoking of tobacco long after recovery from the illness led some to see the habit as sinful, simply because the individual indulged in the practice for \u201cpleasure\u201d. Puritans in England saw non-medical use and dependence on daily tobacco smoking as a sign of a weak and immoral character. A more rational view against the medical use of tobacco argued that a single medication could not possibly cure so many different ailments. It was not till the 20th century that the deleterious health consequences of chronic tobacco smoking became strongly evident and led to efforts to suppress tobacco use. Identification of nicotine and its physiological effects led to insights into the neurochemistry of the autonomic nervous system. More recently nicotine and the nicotinic receptors in brain are being explored as agents that might enhance cognition. Review of tobacco\u2019s history is relevant to the contemporary problem of differentiating socially or medically-approved use from substance abuse and addiction.",

            "text": "In England, smoking became fashionable at a time when Puritanism was taking hold. The Puritans did not deny tobacco's medicinal qualities but objected when smoking was indulged in for non-medical reasons. They noted that tobacco \"drinking\" (as smoking was then termed) was not confined to specific doses at certain times of the day like other medicines, and therefore might be harmful, especially to the young (Apperson 1914). The Puritans in the colony of Connecticut, in attempting to set controls on the consumption of tobacco, passed laws (around 1650) prohibiting persons under the age of 21 from smoking, and ordering that no smoker could enjoy his pipe unless he obtained a doctor's certificate (Apperson 1914). Even with a doctor's permission, smokers of the colony at that time were not allowed to take tobacco publicly in the \u201cstreet, highways, or any barnyards\u201d (Apperson 1914). During the 17th century many writers and physicians condemned the use of tobacco for non-medicinal purposes and attempted to differentiate legitimate use from \"licentious\" abuse. Tobias Venner in his \"Brief And Accurate Treatise Concerning The Taking Of The Fume Of Tobacco, Which Very Many In These Days Do Too Licentiously Use\" (London, 1637) denounced the common mode of smoking tobacco Which most men took \"like tinkers drank ale\" (Apperson 1914). He listed 10 precepts for the correct use of tobacco. For example, that \u201cyou drink not between taking of fumes, as our idle and smoakie Tobacconists are wont\" and \"that you goe not abroad into the aire immediately upon taking of the fume, but rather refrain therefrom the space of half an hour, or more, especially if the season be cold or moist\" (Apperson 1914).",

Tobacco did continue to be employed as medicine, especially in forms other than smoke, until mid-nineteenth century. From the American Civil War to the present, tobacco has been used almost exclusively as a recreational substance. The attacks on its abuse in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were linked to temperance movements and based on moral arguments. Only in the last 50 years has the opposition to smoking been based on strong medicinal arguments. The last attacks on the use of tobacco re-introduced a moral component to the medical argument: non-smokers are subject to some deleterious health consequences of smoke pollution generated by smokers. The point is made that it is immoral to smoke since innocent non-smoking victims (including children) may be hurt.",

It was up to medical profession to provide \"restraints\" in the form of a set of rules for appropriate consumption of tobacco. It should be emphasized, however, that there undoubtedly was a real belief in the medicinal efficacy of tobacco, especially within the context of the fifteenth and sixteenth century notions of health and disease. For example, certain diseases were seen as a disturbance in the balance of four qualities: hot, dry, cold, wet. Catarrh (the common cold), particularly prevalent in the northern countries, was believed to be due to excess of cold and wet, so that applications of hot and dry tobacco smoke was seen as beneficial. Purgation of the head by nasal irrigations and fumigations, or by provoking sneezing, was commonly practiced. \"Caput pungia\" or clearing of the head was the Latin term applied to this practice (Ortiz 1947). Purgation of the gastrointestinal tract by eliciting vomiting or promoting bowel movements were popular medical remedies for which tobacco in one form or another was efficacious (Ortiz 1947),",

This plant, indigenous to desert regions of North Africa, had been reported to be useful in treating fever, bronchitis, scrofula, tumors, toothache, bites of rabid animals, wounds from poisonous weapons, sore throats, pertussis, pleurisy, icterus and epilepsy (Castiglione 1943).

Columbus later wrote, in November 1492, that 2 members of his crew, sent out to explore the island of Cuba, saw many people who carried a burning torch to kindle fire and to perfume themselves with a certain herb. Later it was learned that the herb was smoked in a rolled cylindrical form (cigar) and employed to lessen fatigue and as a disinfectant (Corti 1932). On the second voyage, Columbus left Father Ramon Pan\u00e9 on the island of Hispaniola to convert the Taino Indians. Pan\u00e9 described the use of a snuff, cohoba, derived from an intoxicating plant, by a medicine man in a healing ritual. The \"doctor\" followed the same diet and assumed the same aspect of a sick person. Both doctor and patient would purge themselves by inhaling the snuff intranasally. The use of cohoba was also referred to by many chroniclers, including Oviedo, Las Casas and Columbus himself (Corti 1932). The identity of cohoba has been disputed, but most agree that the effects of the powder might not be due to tobacco alone, but to the addition of powder derived from grinding products of the hallucinogenic plant Piptadenia peregrine (Ortiz 1947).",

Oviedo was the first to use the word tabaco correctly in print. Tabaco was the word for the instrument with which the natives of Hispaniola inhaled the smoke or powder of the herb.

Monardes published his work in Spanish in 1565 in Sevilla -\"Primera, Segunda y Tercera Partes de la Historia Medicinal de las Cosas que se traen de Neustras Indias Occidentales que Sirven en Medicina\". This book which was frequently quoted and translated into many languages (into. English in 1577) became the chief source of information on tobacco. Monardes recommended tobacco in many different forms against a wide range of ailments -a total of 65 different diseases or conditions. (Castiglione 1943)\"This plant, which is commonly called tobacco, is a very ancient herb and known among the Indians, especially those of New Spain. After these lands were conquered by our Spaniards, they, being taught by the Indians, made use of it in wounds suffered in war, healing themselves with it, to the great benefit of all. It was brought to Spain a few years ago more to adorn gardens with its beautiful appearance than for the marvelous medical virtues which it has; now we use it more for these virtues than for its beauty, for they are certainly such as to attract admiration its quality is hot and dry in the second degree. It has the virtue of heating and dissolving, with some astringency and invigoration. It glues together and closes up fresh wounds, so they say, at the first application. It cleans and purifies infected sores, and brings them to perfect health, as we shall describe later. And now I shall speak of the virtues of this plant and the things which it is useful for, one after another \u2026.\"\n",

The use of warmed leaves, salves, clysters (enemas) is prescribed for internal congestion, stomach aches, constipation, kidney stones, and flatulence. For ailments of pregnancy and labor pains a leaf of the plant, very hot, is applied to the navel. To expel worms, tobacco is invaluable. Tobacco is also recommended for rheumatism, abscesses, toothache, and venomous wounds; furthermore, application of tobacco is sufficient to restrain any flux of blood. Monardes advertised tobacco as a household remedy and it was due primarily to his authority that the new herb was accepted by physicians and laymen alike as one of the most popular remedies (Castiglione 1943).",

The tobacco trade was largely in the hands of the Spanish, the enemies of England, and represented great economic loss for the country. King James raised the duty on tobacco in an attempt to diminish importation. Despite the king's opposition in words and deeds, the use of tobacco increased rapidly during his reign. The increased duty imposed by the king suppressed the regular trade and developed a great traffic in smuggling from Spain and the colonies and also promoted the cultivation of tobacco in England. The outbreak of the plague again in 1614 in London helped overcome the king's opposition. Doctors declared that steady smokers were less subject to infection than others and recommended tobacco as a disinfectant, with the result that smoking increased enormously in spite of the king's antipathy (Corti 1932). By 1615, there were upward of 7, 000 apothecaries, grocers, chandlers and inn-keepers living by the trade of selling tobacco in and near London (MacInnes 1926). From 1620 to 1758, the production of tobacco in the English American colonies increased exponentially from 20, 000 lbs. per year to 22,050,000 per year (Jacobstein 1907).",

In 1655, a book had been published in France dealing with the preparation and use of snuff for medicinal purposes (Brooks 1952). Snuff-taking became fashionable among the upper classes in France and rapidly disseminated among the upper classes of Western Europe.

He believed that snuff was particularly advantageous in curing head ailments caused by \"moist humours\" and in the treatment of certain conditions of the eyes and ear. He prescribed snuff powders mixed with balsams and different herbs, which were able to \"relieve the nose of germs and offensive odors and also have a beneficial effect in gout\" (Castiglione 1943). He also warned that constant, careless use of snuff affected the sense of smell and produced throat ailments and its abuse resulted in deafness, insanity and fatal illness (Castiglione 1943). While Hoffman's assertions of the therapeutic value of tobacco was weak, the arguments against its abuse were no better founded (Castiglione 1943). A pupil of Hoffman, Frederick Camel, also published a dissertation in which he analyzed the different qualities of snuff and attempted to explain the action of the different constituents of tobacco. A small controversy arose in Europe over snuff, which was used as much for pleasure as for medicine. Proponents presented case histories to prove snuff had cured bronchitis, consumption, apoplexy and other diseases. Opponents to the use of snuff called snuffers snivellers and snorters, and that they were digging an early grave with their noses. The controversy which ended around 1750 did have the effect of reducing snuff taking for both medicine and social purposes, but the habit did not entirely disappear from medical practice until more than a century later (Stewart 1967).",

With the discovery of this potent poisonous alkaloid, the attacks on the medicinal and recreational use of tobacco were intensified. In 1851, a summation of the effects of tobacco was published by L. B. Coles, in the United States. He emphasized the dependence liability of tobacco, noting that tobacco was never taken like other medicines and then lain aside. \"A man takes this so-called medicine for forty years perhaps, but gets no cure.\" (Stewart 1967) He also cited many, many case histories to prove tobacco never cured diseases for which it was prescribed and noted the harmful effects of nicotine.",

In 1964, the historic Report of the Surgeon General on Smoking and Health was released and reflected the most informed medical opinion on the use of tobacco (Surgeon-General 1964). Cigarette-smoking was judged to be causally related to lung cancer in men. Included as evidence in the judgment of causality were the findings of a dose-response relationship: the risk of death from lung cancer increased directly with duration of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, inhalation and indirectly, with age when smoking began; discontinuation of smoking lowered the risk. Cigarette smoking was judged to be the most important of the causes of chronic bronchitis in both men and women in the U.S. Male smokers were found to have a significantly higher death rates from coronary artery disease than non-smoking males. A causal relationship was not established at that time for coronary artery disease (and a number of other cardiovascular diseases). Significant associations between several other cancer sites and tobacco use were judged to be causal, including pipe-smoking and lip cancer, and cigarette smoking and laryngeal cancer. A number of other diseases or conditions suggested to be associated with smoking by clinical impressions or by showing excess mortalities in the prospective studies were also scrutinized: tobacco use and esophageal cancer, urinary bladder cancer, peptic ulcer, tobacco amblyopia, cirrhosis of the liver, accidents, influenza and pneumonia, and low infant birth weight.

When activated, either by acetylcholine or by nicotine, they allow selected ions to flow across the cell membrane. nAChRs are distributed in the autonomic and central nervous systems and at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine and nicotine act at these receptors to alter electrochemical properties at a variety of synapses, which can in turn affect the release of several other neurotransmitters.",
