At the time of writing this manuscript, the unprecedented public health crisis caused more than 2.5 million cases with a mortality range of 5-7%. The SARS-CoV-2, also called novel Coronavirus, is related to both SARS-CoV and bat SARS. Great efforts have been spent to control the pandemic that has become a significant burden on the health systems in a short time. Since the emergence of the crisis, a great number of researchers started to use the AI tools to identify drugs, diagnosing using CT scan images, scanning body temperature, and classifying the severity of the disease. The emergence of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a challenging problem with expected serious consequences on the management of the disease. Here, we introduce COVIDier, a deep learning-based software that is enabled to classify the different genomes of Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV. COVIDier was trained on 1925 genomes, belonging to the three families of SARS retrieved from NCBI Database to propose a new method to train deep learning model trained on genome data using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), a deep learning algorithm, that could blindly predict the virus family name from the genome of by predicting the statistically similar genome from training data to the given genome. COVIDier able to predict how close the emerging novel genomes of SARS to the known genomes with accuracy 99%. COVIDier can replace tools like BLAST that consume higher CPU and time.",

The pneumonia virus was initially named 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) after virus detection and isolation, which was eventually officially referred to by the WHO as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), (Zhou et al. 2020a ) . WHO announced a health emergency of international significance on 30 January 2020 with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has greater transmitting capacity than the SARS-CoV that contributed to an epidemic of SARS in 2003. The exponential growth in reported cases is particularly severe in the detection and treatment in COVID-19. In comparison to certain cases, COVID-19 clinical signs are characterized by respiratory symptoms (Huang et al. 2020) . Also, several people with cardiovascular disorders (CVD) are at risk of death (Huang et al. 2020) . Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of respiratory failure and death due to COVID-19 infection (Singhal 2020) .",

The SARS coronaviruses possess four genes that encode the spike(S), the matrix(M), the nucleocapsid (N), and the envelop(E) proteins ( Figure 1A ). The 'S' protein is a surface glycoprotein essential for the virus to bind receptors on the host cell, thus determining host tropism (Zhu et al. 2018) . Generally, there is low heterogeneity in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2. A hypervariable genomic hotspot is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020) . In the coronavirus genomic analysis, the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 has low sequence identity with other Betacoronaviruses ( Figure 1B ). The 'S' protein in SARS-CoV-2 is longer than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Most importantly are the difference in the receptor-binding domain between the new SARS-CoV-2 and the other two viruses (Zhou et al. 2020b) . Different receptors on the host cells are involved in the entry of different viruses, e.g. CD26 fro MERS-CoV and ACE2 for SARS-CoV (Lu et al. 2020) . Although several identical residues to that of SARS-CoVs was identified in the SARS-CoV-2, however, they show phylogenic divergence (Letko et al., 2020) .",

Studies have been conducted to facilitate the diagnosis of disease using AI models (Rajalakshmi et al. 2018; Arabasadi et al. 2017; Kumar et al., 2016; Tomlinson et al. 2009 ). In the health data collection, the use of smartphones (Ballivian et al. 2015; Braun et al. 2013; Bastawrous and Armstrong 2013; Paolotti et al. 2014 ) and web-based portals (Fabic et al., 2012) (Metsky et al. 2020) were efficiently examined. These methods will, however, be used in a great time to produce better performance. In addition to the cost-efficiency, the new simulation would help to classify and monitor communities closed to the spreading of the virus. We can also conveniently expand our proposed algorithm to recognize people with moderate symptoms and signs AI has been reported to be one of the most powerful technologies against the new pandemic. Currently, attempts to create new diagnostic methods using machine learning algorithms have been started. In machine learning, for example, high sensitivity and speed were verified with the SARS-CoV-2 research designs utilizing CRISPR-based viral detection systems (Y. . For screening of COVID-19 patients based on their various breathing patterns, neural network recognition models were developed (Gozes et al. 2020) . Likewise, a deep-learning analysis network of the chest CT images was constructed for automatic identification and tracking of COVID-19 patients over time (DeCaprio et al. 2020) . Machine learning has been used by DeCapprio et al. to create an initial COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (DeCaprio et al. 2020) . The mortality likelihood of a patient developing ARDS is predicted by interrogating the initial symptoms (Munsell et al. 2015) .",

An image emerges from and is transported by viruses and transposable elements into the various cellular immune systems. Immune systems have possibly evolved from simple exclusion from superinfection to very complex defense strategies (CDCP 2017) . However, the concept of 'viral genome -host Genome interaction' continues to be the trend after reporting many cellular infection processes are mediated by the virus and the host through a network of genes. The interaction? between genome and genome naturally influences the immune response as well as the drug response. For instance, infection with some influenza A virus subtypes such as H5N1 and H7N9 may cause severe respiratory disease (Berhane et al. 2016; Josset et al. 2014) . Previous studies showed that weaker innate immune responses were induced by H5N1 and H7N9 (Samy et al. 2016; Suzuki et al. 2009 ) .

The accuracy of predictions from a classification algorithm is evaluated using a Classification Report. How many are True Predictions and how many are Wrong.
