To date, more than 2500 cases have been confirmed in China (2047 cases during 2011\u20132012) with mortality ranging from 6.3% to 30% (Liu et al., 2014a, Liu et al., 2014b). In Japan specifically the western part, a total of 113 cases (37 deaths) had been identified until the year 2014 (Yamaguchi Prefectural Surveillance Center of Infectious Disease, 2015). The earliest case among all the reported SFTS cases worldwide was from a patient in Nagasaki who was infected in 2005 (Takahashi et al., 2014).",

Although details of the mechanism of severe disease are not fully understood, it was reported that viral copy numbers in the blood or serum in the fatal cases were significantly higher than in those with survival outcomes (Gai et al., 2012, Yoshikawa et al., 2014). Thus, suppression of viral replication in patients is an important option for therapeutic treatment of the fatal form of the disease. In China, ribavirin has been prescribed to SFTS patients as an attempt to treat them (Liu et al., 2013, Oh et al., 2014). In Japan, clinicians have tried to treat severe SFTS patients with steroid such as methylprednisolone for treatment of hemophagocytic syndrome (IASR, 2013). However, the effects in vivo are unclear, and no effective vaccine or specific treatment for SFTS is currently available.",

Antiviral agents such as nucleotide analogs or protease inhibitors may also be candidates for therapeutic treatment of SFTS. Ribavirin, a guanosine analog, has been shown to be effective for treatment of some viral diseases (Keshtkar-Jahromi et al., 2011, Lange et al., 2014, McCormick et al., 1986, Sidwell and Barnard, 2006). PF-429242, the cellular protease subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site-1 protease (S1P) inhibitor, has been shown to have antiviral activity against some RNA viruses (Olmstead et al., 2012, Pasquato et al., 2012, Urata et al., 2011). In vitro experiments suggest that PF-429242 has a suppressive effect on SFTSV propagation in cultured cells (unpublished data ) and this raised the possibility of the antiviral effects of PF-429242.",

On the other hand, alpha/beta interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice are highly susceptible to SFTSV infection and adult mice have been reported to die following subcutaneous inoculation of 106 focus-forming units (ffu) of SFTSV (Liu et al., 2014c). Thus, IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice are regarded as useful animals for SFTSV infection model in vivo.",

However, viral loads in the tissues were not significantly different between MC- and mock-treated groups. Thus, an unknown mechanism of MINO or CPFX may contribute to the prolonged survival effect. It is noteworthy that MC treatment is unlikely to exacerbate the disease course due to SFTSV infection. Thus, MC treatment should be considered in suspected cases of spotted fever caused by Rickettsia Japonica in the endemic area in Japan, even though diagnosis of spotted fever or SFTS is not definitive.",

Liu et al. showed that IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice were highly susceptible to SFTSV infection (Liu et al., 2014c). In this study, we used IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice of the same background strain (129/Sv) reported previously (Liu et al., 2014c), but we used different virus strain (Japanese isolate YG-1 strain) for virus challenges. The previous study showed only fatal infection with 106\n ffu of SFTSV. Here, we also showed that 106\n ffu of SFTSV (YG-1 strain) caused lethal infection. Furthermore, we showed that inoculations with 102\n ffu of SFTSV caused non-lethal infection. Non-lethal infection induced clinical signs including weight reduction, but the mice survived. In human cases, it has been suggested that the patient\u05f3s viral load is related to disease severity (Gai et al., 2012, Yoshikawa et al., 2014). Thus, a comparison of different infective doses may provide a promising approach to elucidate the mechanism of SFTS severity. Furthermore, dose-dependent mouse models of SFTSV infection are needed for evaluation of future antiviral drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis against SFTSV infection.",
