They may deal with diverse hazards, ranging from chemical, mechanical, biological, physical to electrical, and put themselves at high risk of harm or even death at work. Protective clothing's act as a barrier and protect the wearer from health hazards, thus is effective in diminishing occupational injuries and economic loss.[qv: 1a,3]",

Some other intrinsic dangers of conventional PPE include heat stress, lack of mobility, fall hazard, seizures, physiological malfunction, or anxiety.[qv: 4c,5] Although PPE has benefitted from various high technology innovations, there remain many challenges and areas for improvement.

These extraordinary properties render it an attractive material with potential for diverse technological applications and advantages over other comparable materials.6 The most promising approach to utilize the unique properties of graphene is to use it in composite materials. In recent years, development of new property textile fabrics with multifunctional activity has gained a lot of interest. Incorporating graphene or graphene derivatives into polymers/textiles can improve the properties of fabrics for specific applications.7 Graphene incorporation into fabrics or modification of a textile surface by graphene can not only improve mechanical strength, flame\u2010resistance, conductivity, antibacterial activity, resistance to abrasion, and UV\u2010protectivity but also prevents the diffusion of heat and gases. Graphene\u2010based woven fabrics also exhibit excellent flexibility. All these qualities could be added to PPE textiles in one lightweight application (Figure\n\n1\n) if textile fabrics could be modified by graphene/graphene derivatives.8 Therefore, graphene modified new performance textile may be the breakthrough to overcome the shortcomings of personal protective clothing.",

In most of the protective clothing the base material is coated by different materials from both inside and outside, thus ensuring optimal protection against exposure to hazards.39 Generally butyl rubber, neoprene, polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride are coated on to fabrics to make the protective clothing impermeable to chemicals, liquids, and vapors.[qv: 38e] The common materials that are used in protective clothing include: Polyamide (nylon and aramid) aramid: Aromatic polyamide is used as base material for fire jackets and fire pants. Both para\u2010aramid and meta\u2010aramid polymers are useful in protective clothing. Good mechanical strength and nonflammable nature make para\u2010aramid suitable for ballistic protection and high temperature shield. On the other hand, meta\u2010aramid is specifically used for its excellent thermal stability. The common trade names of aramid based materials that are used for protective clothing are Kevlar, Nomex, Twaron, Corex, Technora, Trellchem, etc.27, 39, 40\n Polyethylene: Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene having high modulus, strength, and chemical resistance are used to prepare splash resistant garments.37 Tyvek clothing is made from high density polyethylene nonwoven fibers. DuPont\u2010Tyvek has exclusive ability of permitting vapor to penetrate, while at the same time blocking penetration of water and air.41 Dyneema, Spectra, and Tekmilon are other available trade names of polyethylene materials for protective clothing.40\n Nonwoven fabrics: Nonwovens are gaining significant interest for manufacturing PPE to improve the safety and comfort of workers. Polymer nonwovens have various applications because of their morphology, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic nature, and easy structure alteration techniques. Recently there has been an upsurge in the demand for specialized nonwoven product.42 Spun\u2010bonded olefins are most commonly used nonwoven fabric manufacturing. Polyethylene nonwoven and pulp/polyester are the foremost materials used in nonwoven protective clothing.40 Tychem chemical protective clothing is made of nonwoven polyester, squeezed in between nonhalogenated fabrics with high mechanical strength.43\n Phenol\u2010aldehyde: Fabrics made of cured phenol aldehyde (Novoloid) possess high resistance to fire, acids and chemicals. Novoloid has been used for manufacturing hybrid materials for protective clothing.40\n Melamine: Melamine based fibers (trade name: Basofil) are very stable at high temperatures, thus found an application in fire fighters protective clothing.[qv: 1a,44] Cellulosic material: Flame retardant and thermal resistant cotton fabric (trade name: Proban) has been widely used as protective clothing for first responders.45 Again, normal cotton, as well as mixtures of cotton and polyester fabrics are widely used as protective clothing of healthcare workers, doctors and patients in hospitals. Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE): Polytetrafluoroethylene has good thermal and chemical stability but possesses low mechanical strength. It is used in protective clothing by mixing with other materials. Gore\u2010Tex and Teflon are trade names of tetrafluoroethylene fabrics.40\n Polyester: Polyester is widely used material for protective clothing. Alike propylene and polyethylene, polyesters are also used to manufacture chemical and gas impermeable HazMat suits. Trevira are Sympatex are available brands of polyester.40\n Phase changing materials (PCM): PCMs are used to boost the thermal performance of the protective clothing to lessen heat stress.46 PCMs are microcapsules that are capable of changing phase to approximate the temperature range of human skin. PCMs can be coated on fabrics or can be incorporated into fabrics to control the temperature. Eicosane encapsulated within melamine\u2010formaldehyde, sodium sulfate (dehydrate), and Galactitol are three typical examples of PCM used in protective clothing research.[qv: 38d,46,47] Activated carbon: Activated carbon or activated charcoal coated fabrics are used for the protection from heat stress, chemicals, and reduction of volatile organic compounds for their excellent adsorption capacity.[qv: 38e,44,48] However, they possess poor mechanical strength.49\n Miscellaneous: Some other fibrous synthetic materials like polyphenylene benzobisoxazole, polyimide, polybenzoxazole (PBO), polyethylene naphthalate, polyurethane, oxidized polyacrylonitrile, and polyetheretherketone are applied in protective clothing for their thermal and chemical stability.[qv: 1a,40,44,50] Polyurethane can be used as semipermeable moisture barrier into the protective clothing.44 Organic and metal electroconductive fibers are used in protective clothing to make it antistatic.40 Resins impregnated with fabrics can increase the mechanical strength of protective clothing.51 In recent years, due to thermal insulation properties, light weight aerogel/nonwoven composites have been used in fire protective clothing instead of conventional dense, weighty, and multilayer clothing.[qv: 47c,52]\n",

All the unique properties of graphene such as, mechanical strength, flame\u2010resistant abilities, conductivity, antibacterial activity, resistance to abrasion, and UV\u2010protectivity can be unified with properties of protective clothing in one lightweight application if textile fabrics could be modified with graphene/graphene derivatives in an effective way.8 In spite of the outstanding properties of graphene and its derivatives, graphene modified fabrics (nylon, cotton, polyester, etc.) are not yet adoptable for large scale textile manufacturing.[qv: 133a] Comfort and sustainability is an interesting issue for graphene modified clothing. As graphene is a monoatomic thick nanomaterial, it is expected that, it will not cause major discomfort. Moreover, has desired multifunctional properties which can reduce the discomfort of conventional protective clothing. To ensure sustainability and good stability of graphene coated protective clothing, modification, and functionalization of graphene and fiber surface is essential for their better interfacial interaction and chemical bonding. More research should be done to address sustainability.[qv: 55e,63a] Other challenges of graphene modified textile clothing, which hinder its application are lack of viable high\u2010quality large\u2010scale production method, less interaction of carbon with chemicals and low dispersity of graphene in solvents.[qv: 63b]",

Working environment, type of associated hazards, duration of exposure, atmospheric conditions, and many other factors determine the selection of appropriate protective clothing.[qv: 38a] Different fibers such as, polyester, cotton, and polyamide have been reported to be modified by graphene using different techniques and materials. Modified composite fabrics show promise as protective clothing. Graphene functionalization and GO reduction are the promising ways to improve the processabilities and for obtaining bulk graphene respectively. Reduction of GO is considered an effective way to manufacture graphene\u2010based textile composites for GO's versatile surface chemistry.[qv: 63a,110b,114] By combining different textile fabrics with graphene or graphene derivatives, different protective clothing with desired properties can be prepared.
