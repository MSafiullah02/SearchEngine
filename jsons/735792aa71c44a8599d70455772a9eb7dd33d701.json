            "text": "1 2 Effects of a blend of essential oils in milk replacer on performance, rumen fermentation, 3 blood parameters and health scores of dairy heifers 4 5 Abstract 23 The objective of this study was to evaluate how the inclusion of a blend of essential oils 24 in milk replacer (MR) affects different outcomes of dairy heifers. The outcomes 25 evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, 26 insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores and respiratory 2 27 scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 -60 d of age), and 28 carryover effects on post-weaning (61 -90 d of age) periods. The experimental units 29 utilized were 29 newborn Holstein \u00d7 Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic 30 composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth 31 of 32.2 \u00b1 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group 32 (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of 33 essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-34 weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), 35 divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the 36 post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, 37 divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were 38 evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was 39 recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood 40 cell count, weekly to determinate \u00df-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly 41 for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and 42 acetate:proprionate proportion -C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized 43 complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the 44 experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. 45 An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test 46 was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results 47 indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of 48 effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood 49 metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results 50 indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 51 during pre and post-weaning (P \u2264 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil 52 (P \u2264 0.001) and platelet (P \u2264 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week 3 53 and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P \u2264 0.001), revealing a long-term 54 treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P 55 \u2264 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. BEO contributed for ruminal 56 manipulation on pre-weaning and carry over effect on post-weaning; immunity 57 improvement and a decrease morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in pre-weaning phase. 58 59 Introduction 60 A good calf-rearing program should embrace aspects that go from body 61 development, stress reduction, good feed and housing management to optimum health 62 status. Average daily gain (ADG) and body weight (BW) at weaning are important 63 metrics used to measure the success of the rearing program. It is well known that these 64 parameters are related to the heifer's future milk production, as well as to its immune 65 responses. Therefore, a bad life start can impact negatively on animal's adult 66 performance (1). Neonatal diseases, especially diarrhea, and nutritional mistakes can act 67 as stressors, lowering calf immunity, and increasing animal susceptibility to other 68 disorders (2).",

Thus feed additives, such as growth 81 promoter antibiotics, have been used to improve both rumen development and animal 82 health (5), as well as increase performance and feed efficiency (6). However, the use of 83 antibiotics in animal production for this purpose has been under severe criticism. Due to 84 the increase of bacterial resistance and impact over human health it has been banned in 85 several countries. Furthermore, the increase of organic dairy farms in the past years 86 revealed a change in milk consumers' preference with increased demand for \"natural\" 87 and healthier foods.

(Table 3) 355 during pre and post-weaning. As was also observed for intake and ADG, a week effect 16 356 (P \u2264 0.05) was detected in all variables due to normal animal growth. Table 4 ). Since there were no differences between treatments during pre-375 weaning, the carryover effect may not be assumed to be the answer for this difference.",
