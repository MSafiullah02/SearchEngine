            "text": "Asbestos exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some novel loci for lung cancer risk, few addressed genome-wide gene-environment interactions. To determine gene-asbestos interactions in lung cancer risk, we conducted genome-wide geneenvironment interaction analyses at levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and pathways, using our published Texas lung cancer GWAS dataset. This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 cancer-free controls. The initial SNP-level P-values for interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status and pack-years. The P-value for the most significant SNP rs13383928 was 2.17 \u00d7 10 -6 , which did not reach the genome-wide statistical significance. Using a versatile gene-based test approach, we found that the top significant gene was C7orf54, located on 7q32.1 (P = 8.90 \u00d7 10 -5 ). Interestingly, most of the other significant genes were located on 11q13. When we used an improved gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that the Fas signaling pathway and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant (nominal P < 0.001; false discovery rate < 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17 572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the gene-asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.",

            "text": "Asbestos, a term for a group of naturally occurring hydrated silicate fibers, has been widely used in >3000 manufactured products. Exposure to asbestos can result in pleural lung fibrosis, and inhaled asbestos may cause peritoneal malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer (1) . It is estimated that occupationally related asbestos exposure contributes to ~5-7% of all lung cancer cases (2) . Although the use of asbestos has been banned or severely restricted since early 1970s in many developed countries, asbestos-related lung diseases still pose a great public health threat because of a long-latency period from asbestos exposure to the incidence of asbestos-induced diseases (3) . Genetic factors have been suggested to be involved in asbestos-related carcinogenesis and lung genotoxicity by causing oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage-repair response, mutations, chromosomal aberrations, mitochondrial malfunction and apoptosis (4, 5) . To date, the impact of individual genetic variations on asbestos-related lung cancer risk is still not well understood. A small number of studies using a candidate gene approach reported that polymorphisms in genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (e.g. GSTM1, GSTT1, MPO, CYP1A1 and CYP2E1) and manganese superoxide dismutase (e.g. SOD2 and MnSOD) were associated with asbestos-related lung cancer risk (6) (7) (8) .",

However, even the most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in GWASs have only accounted for a small proportion of the estimated heritability (11) . Besides rare variants and structural variants, gene-environment interaction is expected to be a possible source of missing heritability not explained by current GWASs (12, 13) . Although environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke and asbestos exposure, play an important role in lung cancer development, few reported studies have investigated the potential of the genome-wide gene-environment interactions following the initial findings of lung cancer GWASs. Because current GWASs have been designed to detect the main effect of genetic variants, which often suffer from inadequate sample sizes, the ability to detect geneenvironment interactions even in the single SNP analysis has been limited (14) .",

These approaches combine associations of genetic variants in either the same gene or biological pathway with disease risk and enable us to summarize the associations on a functional basis. Furthermore, these approaches enhance researchers' ability to investigate additional susceptibility genes and pathways to address 'missing heritability', with the potential of unraveling the mechanisms underlying the etiology of complex diseases. Several recent studies have shown that gene-based and pathway-based approaches to gene-environment interactions using existing GWAS datasets could successfully facilitate the mining of biological information and provide additional complementary information (17, 18) .",

In the i-GSEA analysis, we use the maximum -log (P-value) or statistics of all the SNPs mapped to a gene to represent the gene (t). Then, we ranked all genes in GWAS by decreasing values, and the genes at the top 5% with the small P-values were considered statistically significant. For each given pathway S, significance proportion-based enrichment score was calculated to estimate the enrichment of genotype-phenotype association in a particular gene set S. Then, i-GSEA performed label permutations to calculate nominal P-values to assess the significance of the pathway-based enrichment score and the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct multiple testing. i-GSEA was implemented by using SNP-label permutations instead of phenotype-label permutations in a classical GSEA in order to calculate nominal P-values. Moreover, i-GSEA focuses on the pathways or gene sets with the highest proportions of significant genes instead of relying solely on the total significance generated from either a few or many significant genes, thus improving the sensitivity to identify pathways or gene sets that represent the combined effects of all possibly modest SNPs/genes. Since i-GSEA uses P-values at both SNP and gene levels as input data, it was convenient to perform the pathway-based analysis in the existing GWAS dataset, especially for the GWAS gene-environment interaction analysis. For P-values at the SNP level, we mapped all SNPs within 20 kb around a gene estimated precisely for the association of a gene. Considering the relatively low coverage of Illumina HumanHap300 v1.1 BeadChips, we also compared the results by mapping SNPs within 20 kb around the gene and by mapping SNPs within 100 kb around the gene. Next, the canonical pathways or gene sets were used for further pathway analyses. These canonical pathways were extracted and curated from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) v2.5 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/) (22) . MSigDB included gene sets denoting canonical pathways integrated from a variety of online resources like KEGG (23), signal transduction knowledge environment (Science Signaling, [24] ), BioCarta (25) , GO (gene ontology) terms with high confidence (26) . To reduce the multiple-testing issue and to avoid too narrow or too broadly defined pathways, we restricted our analysis to pathways with 20-200 genes as the default (27) . Pathways or gene sets with FDR < 0.25 were regarded as mild confidence that the G \u00d7 E interactions were enriched in a pathway; FDR < 0.05 were regarded as high confidence that the interactions were enriched in a gene or pathway.",

Fas signaling could trigger the apoptosis of T lymphocytes and play a critical role against autoimmunity and tumor development (40, 41) . Although polymorphisms in the Fas signaling pathway have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (42) , few studies have reported an interaction between genetic variations in the Fas signaling pathway and asbestos exposure in the etiology of lung cancer. But previous studies showed that mice deficient for Arf were susceptible to accelerated asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma and that homozygous loss of the Faf1 (FAS-associated factor 1) locus deregulated the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-induced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling, which had previously been implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis (43, 44) . Recent work also suggested that asbestos exposure might increase FAS expression in lung tissue (45) . So our finding provides a possible biological explanation that genetically determined function of the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway may be involved in asbestos-related lung carcinogenesis.",

The genes in this pathway help to discriminate and present antigens to T-cell receptors, natural killer cells and other immune cells (47) , and studies have found that asbestos can disturb autoimmunity and tumor immunity, while inducing DNA damage and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells (48, 49) . This is because asbestos possesses the super antigenic capacity against T cells and the restricted overexpression of the T-cells receptor V beta without clonal expansion (50) . In addition, the function of natural killer cells and regulatory T cells was depressed when they were exposed to asbestos (51) . If the immune function is impaired as a result of the asbestos-induced pathogenesis, genetic variations in these pathways will modulate the risk of asbestos-related diseases, including lung cancer. The findings of gene-asbestos interactions at levels of SNP, gene and pathway are seemingly not consistent for specific genes or specific chromosome regions in this study, but it is of interest that all the interactions at these three levels seem to tend to point to the genes or pathways involved in immune function regulation, which might be one of the possible mechanisms involved in the asbestos-related carcinogenesis.",

Our previous study had shown that risk estimates for interactions of genetic variants with self-reported asbestos exposure, self-reported occupational exposure and self-reported employment in asbestos-related industries were similar, in which all these asbestos exposure measurements were reviewed and confirmed by a certified industrial hygienist (6), although reporting bias may still exist. Second, the coverage of the genotyping chip in this study is relatively low. A single SNP may be simultaneously mapped on nearby genes in the gene-asbestos interaction analyses, which may lead to errors in the analyses at the gene and pathway levels. Third, we did not have the access to similar datasets available for us to replicate our findings. This may be due to a myriad of reasons, some of which include lack of asbestos exposure data in publicly available lung cancer GWAS datasets and/or the lack of common or comparable definitions for asbestos exposure. Furthermore, the current pathway-based analysis assumes that the local SNP only modify the function of the local gene, which is only partially true. The cis and trans regulation of the genes should be considered in the future pathway-based analysis. In addition, for the limitation of relatively small sample size, we have not performed the stratified G \u00d7 E interactions analyses by histology, but the most informative gene-environment interactions between asbestos exposure and lung cancer risk could only be determined in large cohorts of patients with the histology of interest associated with that exposure. Despite these limitations, our study demonstrated the advantage of performing the pathway-based analysis that integrates biological knowledge and biostatistics approaches, thus forming a useful and important tool for analyzing data from existing GWASs and the forthcoming whole genome sequence association studies (52, 53) .",
