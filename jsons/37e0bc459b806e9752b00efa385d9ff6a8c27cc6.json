Understanding its transmission characteristics including heterogeneity is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics. In addition, transmission heterogeneity usually envokes super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases. Till now, studies of transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 and its underlying reason are far from reaching an agreement. Methods: We collected information of all infected cases between January 21 and February 26, 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China. . Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k which characterized the transmission potential and heterogeneity, respectively. Furthermore, we studied the SSE in Tianjin outbreak and evaluated the effect of control measures undertaken by local government based on the heterogeneous model. Results: A total of 135 confirmed cases (including 34 imported cases and 101 local infections) in Tianjin by February 26th 2020 entered the study. We grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of 4 generations. The estimated reproduction number R was at 0.67 (95%CI: 0.54\u223c0.84), and the dispersion parameter k was at 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13\u223c0.88). A super spreader causing six infections in Tianjin, was identified. In addition, our simulation results showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since January 28th. Conclusions: Our analysis suggested that the transmission of COVID-19 was subcritical but with significant heterogeneity and may incur SSE. More efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors, which is important for developing targeted measures to curb the pandemic.",

The density and mean of duration and outbreak size were estimated based on 5000 Monte-Carlo simulations.Discussion194Based on individual-level information of COVID-19 infection cases in the city of195 Tianjin, we discovered significant transmission heterogeneity (k = 0.25, 95%CI: 196 0.13\u223c0.88) and subcritical transmission potential (R = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.54\u223c0.84) 197 and identified one super-spreader who infected 6 individuals, suggesting that the 198 local outbreak in Tianjin was considerably heterogeneous even though it would 199 finally die out. In addition, our numerical results successfully verify the effectiveness 200 of government control deployed on January 28th in Tianjin. 201 Our finding of significant transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 outbreak in 202 Tianjin was inconsistent with the previous studies conducted in ShenZhen, China 203 .",

            "text": "absence of heterogeneity in these two studies could have been due to the 205 failure of tracking some epidemiological links among cases. In addition, our result 206 was consistent with another study conducted among 46 countries (k = 0.1, 95%CI: 207 0.05\u223c0.2)[14]. However, it should be noted that the large scale spreading of 19 is likely to be heterogeneous because of many extrinsic factors, such as weather209 [22] and different control measures, may affect the transmission of pathogen, while 210 our confirmation of transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in a local outbreak 211 justified that some intrinsic properties of the pathogen might also lead to heteroge-212 neous transmission. Our finding is more meaningful for the development of targeted 213 control measures. 214 Besides the super spreader in Tianjin as discussed in the results, some other 215 SSEs were also identified based on our criterion in other cities of China, such as in 216 Ningbo, Zhejiang [23], in Harbin, Heilongjiang [24], and in Hongkong [25]. With the 217 tendency of pandemic of COVID-19, all the governments should strengthen controls 218 to prevent SSEs. 219 Previous studies identified multiple underlying reasons for the emergence of SSEs 220 and high transmission heterogeneity [5]. For example, SSEs of MERS-CoV and 221 SARS-CoV were largely driven by the environmental and clinical factors, such as 222 hospital transfer, substantial delay of diagnosis and fundamentally crowding of pop-223 ulation [4, 5]. The transmission heterogeneity and the identified SSE of COVID-19 in 224 Tianjin, however, exhibited different features. The SSE happened in a working place, 225 and there was no obvious delay of diagnosing the super-spreader (3 days from onset 226 of symptom to diagnosis). In addition, the longest transmission chain (as shown in 227 Fig.2) occured after the initiation of Level one response of public health emergency 228 by the Tianjin government. The public were then advised to avoid mass gathering 229 and to stay at home. Obviously, the aforementioned reasons for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV did not hold in the COVID-19 out-231 break. Therefore, we suspected the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 were 232 driven by some other epidemiological characteristics, such as asymptomatic trans-233 mission and contagiousness during incubation period, i.e., transmission can occur 234 before symptom onset. The onset of viral shedding prior to the onset of symptoms, 235 or in cases that remain asymptomatic, is a classic factor that makes infectious dis-236 ease outbreaks difficult to control [26]. A recent reported transmission chain of large 237 size in Harbin, China were triggered by asymptomatic infections [27], which justi-238 fied our speculation and highlighted the need for efficient measures such as rapid 239 testing suspected cases to reduce the transmission from subclinical cases. 240 Additionally, our estimate of transmission potential (R < 1) suggested that the 241 spreading of COVID-19 would not cause large infection in Tianjin. This estimate 242 was the average trend over the period of data collection (from January 21st to 243 February 26th), and was considerable lower than that of other studies, especially 244 at the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak [11]. The differences in the reproductive 245 number reported from different studies are largely due to differences methods, dif-246 ferences in data sources and time periods used to estimate the reproductive number. 247 In addition, as indicated with our evaluation based on simulation, the value of R < 1 248 indicated that the control measures imposed in succession by the local government 249 had been considerable reduce the transmissibility of virus. 250 Regarding the effect of control measure undertaking by the local government, 251 there were changes in point estimates of R and k of before and after government 252 control, but the difference was not statistically significant with overlapping confi-253 dence intervals. Even though, by considering the resulted decrease of 19% infection 254 (from 165 cases to 135 cases) within 25 days, these control measures still had some 255 practical implication. And the non-significant changes in parameter estimates might 256 be due to the short period of observation. spread of COVID-19 is currently under control in China, it is still 258 facing the risk and challenge brought by the resumption of work and imported cases 259 from other countries. The verification of transmission heterogeneity and SSE in 260 Tianjin outbreak of COVID-19 and the analysis of the underlying reasons remind 261 the government to pay much attention to asymptomatic transmission and other 262 factors that may lead to the transmission heterogeneity and SSEs. Furthermore, 263 more efforts are also needed to explore the emergence of SSE and its contributing 264 factors. 265 It is also worth mentioning the limitation of our study. Totally 34 imported cases 266 were reported in Tianjin during the period of our study, but we identified 43 trans-267 mission chains, which meant some epidemiology links among cases were missing. 268 The estimate of heterogeneity might be driven up if the confirmed cases were con-269 densed into fewer transmission chains. Meanwhile, we only analyzed COVID-19 270 data from Tianjin (135 confirmed cases), a relatively small sample size compared 271 with the total number in China (exceeds 80,000 confirmed cases), and our case data 272 might be subject to bias or under-reporting, which could not destroy our conclusion 273 of significant heterogeneity [28]. 274 In conclusion, we proved that the transmission of COVID-19 is heterogeneous 275 and identified the existence of one SSE in Tianjin. We also showed that the control 276 measures undertaken by the local government in effect alleviated the outbreak in 277 terms of infection size and duration. As a pandemic which is still spreading world-278 wide at a startling speed, the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 needs more 279 exploration and investigation in a large scale.",

So far, two studies found no heterogeneity in Singapore [12] and in a southern city of China [13], but one study confirmed heterogeneity based on data from 46 countries [14]. In addition, several possible SSEs have been reported in China[15, 16] which involved large numbers of infections. Hence, it would be essential to further explore the transmission heterogeneity and SSE in COVID-19 pandemic and its relevant factors In this study, we investigated the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 using the epidemiological data of all the confirmed cases in a metropolis in Northern China. We analysed the transmission chains and then estimated the reproduction number and the transmission heterogeneity using a branching model along with 46 a negative binomial offspring distribution [17]. In addition, we identified the SSE according to the 99-percentile criterion in [2] and assessed the effect of control measures employed by local government. Tianjin is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China, with a population of 15.66 million and an area of 11,966 square kilometers. Since the first case of COVID-19 in Tianjin was confirmed on January 21st, a total of 135 cases were confirmed by the time of data collection (February 26th, 2020) of the current study.From 6:00 on February 22 to 18:00 on February 26, the city had no new confirmed cases for 108 consecutive hours. The municipal government publicized the epidemi-ological information of the cases every day. Diagnosis of COVID-19 were based on the protocol issued by China CDC [18]. From the official websites of the Municipal Health Commissions [19], we retrieved data of the 135 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, including demographic characteristics, epidemiological characteristics, i.e., travel history and contact history",
