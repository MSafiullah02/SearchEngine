            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the genus Coronavirus in Coronaviridae family. CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid (capsid with nucleic acid) reported size of 300\u2013400 nm under the electron microscope [6]. All CoVs are pleomorphic viruses that usually produce 80\u2013160 nm and 27\u201332 kb positive polarity of crown-shaped peplomers [7]. CoV recombinations are very large as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) jumps, and transcription errors are continually increasing, which might lead to genetic drifting within the same strain [8]. With their rapid mutation rates, CoVs are zoonotic viruses found in humans as well as other animal species, with a broad array of clinical symptoms from asymptomatic to the hospitalization in an intensive-care facility [3]. CoVs were not known to be highly pathogenic in humans until they were first detected in Guangdong in 2002 and 2003 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [9]. There were two more common types of CoVs, CoV-OC43, and CoV-229E, that trigger moderate infections in people with an adequate immune system, before these outbreaks. About 10 years ago, since SARS appeared, MERS-CoV in the Middle East countries, another extremely pathogenic CoV virus has evolved [9,10]. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (nCoV) was established in Wuhan, Huanan, province of Hubei, and has become a significant global priority because of the outbreak of pneumonia, where livestock was exchanged (traded) [11]. The novel new virus SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known CoV to infect humans from this viral family. At first, on 12 December 2019, an unexplained case of pneumonia was identified in Wuhan. Laboratory tests eliminated suspected influenza and other CoVs. On 7 January 2020, the authorities in China declared the isolation of the new CoV type [12]. On 12th January, 2019-nCoV was designated by WHO, and on 11 February 2020 was assigned COVID-19 name. A total of 2,355,853 recorded cases were registered, with 164,656 fatalities as of the 20 April 2020 [13]. On 29 January 2020, Li et al.\u2018s case study reported in the New Britain Journal of Medicine summarizes the 425 first documented cases in Wuhan [3,14].",

At the time of writing this review, Although China declared that it is free of new cases, but have been reported at the beginning of April of 2020 of viral re-emergence. A surge in the reported cases in Europe (Italy, France, Spain and UK) and the USA had been reported [15]. This review is intended to provide an informed opinion on the epidemic and forms in which this initial outbreak may be handled and avoided with expert insight into the current and potential available therapies. Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute have found no proof that SARS-CoV-2 is a product of bio-engineering (manipulation) in laboratory facilities by conducting a comparative analysis of genomic data [16]. Therefore, this virus is possibly novel and subsequent natural results of the mutations that the CoVs family is renowned for having.",

In consideration of the possibility of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been trying to grasp this emerging virus and its pathophysiology to recognize potential therapeutic protocols and to find therapeutic agents and vaccinations that are successful in the disease management. Several pneumonia cases that were localized in Wuhan in December 2019 were identified, and sources were checked. On 12 December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was identified with apparent pneumonia, while on 31 December 2019, 27 cases of extreme viral pneumonia were officially confirmed [15]. Etiological studies of people that came to the hospital due to specific viruses have been conducted. The medical history of these patients has increased the likelihood of a virus outbreak. Novel SARS-COV-2 from wild bats and group 2 \u03b2-CoVs, which comprises severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-COV), was announced to be developed on 22 January 2020. This was the case, although COVID-19 and SARS belong to the same category of \u03b2-CoVs, genome-overlap between the two species is only 70%. The research group led by Bao S has reported that there are some genetic differences with SARS-CoV [17]. This outbreak has occurred in similar ways to the SARS epidemic during China's spring festival, which is China's most prominent traditional festival, where almost 3 billion citizens fly around the world to witness it. This created ideal conditions for the transmission and resulted in severe problems in the prevention and control of this extremely infectious disease. From 17 January till 23 February 2003, the Chinese Spring Festival ended in the SARS outbreak, and from 10th January to 18th February 2020, the festival was conducted once more. The number of COVID-19 reports from 10 to 22 January has risen rapidly. Wuhan is also a significant node of the spring festival transport network, the center of the outbreak, with approximately 10 million inhabitants. The number of tourists expected at the spring festival in 2020 rose 1, seven-times over 2003, the same festival, from 1.82 billion up to 3.11 billion. The massive population flow has often provided ideal conditions for this problem to spread [19].",

            "text": "Based on the structural studies of \u03b1- and \u03b2-coronavirus, the viral genome encodes many structural proteins; including the spike (S) protein glycosylated, which serves as a critical inducer for the host immune response with a functional polybais (furin) cleavage site at the S1\u2013S2 boundary through 12 nucleotides that have been reported [16]. The S protein mediates host cell invasion by SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 through binding of the host cell's membrane protein receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [6,20]. A detailed study conducted has shown that this cellular invasion includes the production of S-proteins, facilitated by serine protease TMPRSS211, formed by the host cell. The viral genome also encodes a variety of nonstructural proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), coronaviral principal protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) [21]. The viral genome is discharged as a positive sense of a single-strand RNA (ssRNA) into the cell. Subsequently, it uses host cell protein translation machinery (ribosomes) to produce the viral polyprotein and then cleaves it into effector proteins through viral proteases 3CLpro and PLpro [22]. The most complex component of the CoV genome is the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein. Six RBD amino acids were found to be important for ACE2 binding and the host spectrum of viruses close to SARS-CoV [23]. The Y442, S472, N479, D480, T487 and Y4911, which are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505 in SARS-CoV-2, are the co-ordinates centered on SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV are five or six residues. SARS-CoV-2 tends to have an RBD that connects humans, ferrets, cats and other highly-receptor-homologated animals with elevated ACE2 affinity [6,24].",

            "text": "As there were several new SARS-CoV-2 cases in association with the Huanan market in Wuhan [25,26], an animal host could be identified as a source of virus transmission. Since SARS-CoV-2 is identical to previous bat SARS-CoV [26], bats are possibly the host for their progenitor. While RaTG13, sampled with Rhinolophus affinis bat, is approximately 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that it cannot effectively bind to human ACE2 [27]. Furthermore, illegally smuggled infected animals into Guangdong province, such as Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica), can carry CoVs that is identical to SARS-CoV-2 [28]. Besides, while there is no animal CoV quite close to SARS-CoV-2, the range of the CoVs is greatly undersampled in bats and other animals. In the S1\u2013S2 junction of the CoV mutations, insertions and removals of nucleiotides may occur []. This demonstrates that a normal evolutionary cycle will lead to a polybasic cleavage location. In order for the precursor virus to obtain the polybase site of cleavage and the spike protein mutations necessary for the human binding of ACE2, it will possibly need an animal host with a large population density (for natural selection to occur effectively) and an ACE2 gene close to that present in human [16]. The SARS-CoV-2 progenitor has probably jumped to humans, gaining the mentioned genomic features by evolving during unrecognized human-to-human transmission. Such adaptations allowed the pandemic of the disease once it has been acquired [26,28].",

The respiratory tests were shown to be positive for the virus, although the serum in the early days of infection was negative. This has indicated that patients had elevated virus rates amid minimal signs in the early days of illness [43]. Besides commonly used RT-PCR for the diagnosis of MERS-CoV, several diagnostic procedures have been reported in four clinical trials, such as RT-LAM (RT-LAM)P, RT-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-IiPCR) and rRT-PCR (RT-PCR) as one-step test focused on unique TaqMan kit. RT-LAMP is as responsive as RT-PCR, as summarized in Table 1. It is also extremely sensitive and can be used for MERS-CoV strain identification. It is comparable to the standard diagnostic tests and is fast, easy and comfortable. RT-iiPCR and a one-step RRT-PCR study were equally responsive and demonstrated strong MER-CoV specificity. Finally, a review based on validating the six consumer RT-PCR kits was carried out [38,43].",

The analysis technique will be qualified and familiarized with and understood by the participating analysts. Inappropriate processing, distribution or treatment may result in false-negative results due to insufficient viral biological material in the sample.

This is an essential step in developing a vaccine for SARS-COV-2. All the coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encodes nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and S protein [20], as shown in Figure 1. The N-Protein is a structural protein bound to the RNA genome of coronavirus and thereby forms a capsid around the enclosed nucleic acid. The N-protein has the following roles in viral life-cycle: associates with the viral membrane protein during viral assembly, and facilitates the production and folding of RNA, this plays a part in viral budding. S protein has two main tasks that enable host infection: it facilitates the interaction between viruses and host cells throughout the surface receptors and it enables their entrance into the host's cell by helping to connect the viral cell membranes with the host's membranes [20,47]. ACE2 is an intrinsic protein membrane that enables the entry of SARS-COV-2 throughout invasion by binding its extracellular peptidase domain to S protein [26].",

It can take more than 1 year to complete clinical trials for most candidates with the exception of those sponsored by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Technologies (CEPI). However, the BGI kit met the national medicinal devices' authorization test and is actually in use in China's therapeutic and testing centers [50]. Out of 570 original research reviewed for SARS-CoV-2, SARS CoV or MERS-CoV vaccinations, only four have been included [3]. In the majority of the SARS and MERS research, as carried out in cell or animal models, they were omitted. The four trials used in this analysis included the Phase-I SARS or MERS clinical tests. No population style studies were carried out at the screening point on the SARS-CoV-2 (cell, species, human). The clinical trials released were conducted mostly in the USA, but one on SARS in China [51\u201353].

Thanks to a growing outbreak when R0 approaches 1 (SARS-CoV-2 is 2.2), regulation strategies need to work on reducing the value down to less than 1 [13]. Preventive approaches rely on hospital separation and diligent infection management, including effective preventive intervention and emergency treatment for an affected hospital. For starters, during the processing of specimens, droplets, touch and airborne measures should be taken, and the usage of sputum induction prevented. The WHO and other organizations have made the following general guidelines: prevent intimate contact with people having severe respiratory infections. Always wash hands, especially after being in contact with contaminated individuals or environment. Stop unsafe field touch or wildlife interaction. People with severe airway diseases should remain away, coughs or sneezes should be protected with jetty tissue or fabric and their hands should also be cleaned. Strengthen the implementation of strict hygiene measures to avoid and manage infections, particularly in the emergency medicine departments [17]. Immunocompromised individuals should not attend public meetings. The most effective technique is to use handheld sanitizer, wash hands, avoid interaction with face and mouth after engaging in contaminated areas. Infected caregivers should use PPE, gloves, eye cover, gowns and face mask (N95 or FFP3) to avoid the spread of the pathogen.",

Over the years, websites such as FluTrackers.com, ProMED (promedmail.org), and others have allowed disease knowledge to be gathered from all around the world and encouraged its distribution to stakeholders. MERS-CoV first attracted the attention of scientific researchers, virologists and public health authorities as to the novel coronavirus embedded in ProMED Mail in 2012 and afterward [11]. 8 years later, a closer related network rapidly circulated claims regarding potential causes from the Wuhan municipal health board. Early in an epidemic, rumors with elements of fact and baseless paranoia can hardly differentiate. The linguistic barriers and record sources may intensify this reality. In this case, however, speculation of a new coronavirus was fueled by well-formulated statements that explicitly excluded individual families of viruses (influenza, adenovirus) but exclusively excluded coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Following SARS\u2019 experiences, others became worried that the facts should be preserved. The planet behaved both with fear and alleviated as the agent was ultimately identified as a SARS-CoV-2, the epidemic will not be cached. Although far from flawless, the government's reaction to SARS-CoV-2 compares strongly with the early SARS epidemic. The rapid release of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provided for rapid interaction, review and the creation of diagnostic tests within the scientific community [16]. Both the Chinese CDC and Wuhan municipal health board have frequently reported reports of the incidents and patient condition to the public health officials so that they can track the situation in real-time. Online media also enabled researchers from all over the world to link up-to-date sequential details and illustrate critical disease acknowledgements. The opportunity to exchange news reports and pieces of evidence in real-time with experts and public health professionals around the globe does not necessarily deliver accurate findings, and it is a massive improvement in the approach to outbreaks. Such openness has rendered the global science community aware of new partnerships and reacted rapidly. While several unknowns remain present with SARS-CoV-2, the environment is dedicated to fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus imminently. Perhaps this indicates that the experiences from the epidemic of SARS were learned.",

The development of novel compounds or vaccines that work correctly against SARS-CoV-2 is a time-consuming process. Thus, efforts are focusing on repurposing the use of drugs available on the market to act against SARS-CoV-2 [65\u201367]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine stand as excellent examples and are being adopted at the moment in the standard clinical practices of China for SARS-CoV-2 infection [27]. However, the validity of using these compounds should be further confirmed. Accordingly, agents with confirmed curing potentials are still lacking. All the therapeutic agents are still under evaluation, and the outcomes derived from clinical trials will determine future winners of the race. Currently, patients are still managed adjunctively. Standard care is composed of isolation and prevention measurements, supportive care for symptoms and complications as well as advanced organs supports in patients with severe illness status [68]. The patients with mild illness and no risk factors can be managed in outpatient settings. However, due to risks of deterioration in health, sudden respiratory failure and isolation failure, inpatients setting are preferred when possible. Outpatients settings include sporadic cases or small clusters, or in repurposed, nontraditional settings; or at home [69]. The isolation and prevention measurements include isolating patients and all suspected cases in a separate area. The isolation should be continued for at least 2 weeks after symptoms relief [70].",

These agents might mask fever and delay diagnosis and treatment [71]. Both paracetamol and NSAIDs can be considered to relieve pain. The reports for avoiding ibuprofen are not validated yet [69,70]. These reports suggest that NSAIDs may upregulate ACE receptors, which could worsen the disease progression [71]. Examples of supportive management are described briefly in several studies. For example, 199 patients in a clinical study conducted in Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, received a supportive therapy of supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotics, vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [72]. Another clinical study at the national clinical research center for infectious diseases (the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China, has reported the use of oxygen inhalation, oral or intravenous rehydration therapy, electrolyte correction, antipyretics, analgesics and antiemetic drugs as supportive therapy for the patient [73]. Another example of supportive care is what is given to the first diagnosed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington, USA. The dosage of 650 mg acetaminophen every 4 h and 600 mg ibuprofen every 6 h was administered as prescribed to the patient. In the first 6 days of hospitalization, he was also given 600 mg guaifenesin for persistent coughing and around 6 L of regular saline [74]. As mentioned above, the used empirical antibiotics are varied depending on local epidemiology and common bacterial pathogens [17]. For example, a retrospective study from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China showed that antibiotics were given to 70 patients (71%). About 25 patients received a single antibiotic, while 45 patients received a combination of antibiotics. Used antibiotics included cephalosporins, quinolones, carbapenems, tigecycline and/or linezolid [75]. Another study on 139 patients has shown that antibacterial therapy is given as moxifloxacin, 64.4%; ceftriaxone, 24.6%; and azithromycin, 18.1% [76]. There are still no detailed guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 patients with comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and cancer. However, current recommendations are still according to the conventional guidelines for each comorbidity [70].",

Since the outbreak, several clinical trials have been investigated on the potentials of this combination (LPV/RTV) on SARS-CoV-2 patients outcomes. A clinical trial was conducted in Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, Wuhan, on 199 seriously ill patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection [80]. Male and nonpregnant patients of 18 years or older were included. The patients have an oxygen saturation of 94% or less with pneumonia confirmed by chest imagining. They were divided into two groups: a control group received the standard care in hospital, and the other treatment group received a combination of LPV/RTV (400 and 100 mg, respectively) twice daily plus the standard hospital care for 14 days. The treatment group showed no improvement in survival compared with control patients. The mortality percentage in LPV/RTV patients was not significantly different from control 19.2, and 25%, respectively [81]. No differences in the percentages of viral RNA detection was found at different times points in the members of the two groups [72]. Another clinical trial was conducted at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen to measure the effectiveness of favipiravir (FPV) compared with LPV/RTV combination as control. FPV is a novel RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor that showed promising in vitro results on SARS-CoV-2 [82]. It blocks the replication of several viruses other than influenza. The included patients have an age range of 16\u201375. Patients with severe conditions, including RR >30, oxygen saturation <93%, respiratory failure, shock, and end-stage kidney or liver diseases, were excluded. The FPV group included 35 patients and received FPV day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; days 2\u201314: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily). The LPV/RTV group received (days 1\u201314: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-\u03b1 by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily). Standard care was given to both groups. Clinical outcomes include viral clearance (two constitutive negative results on qPCR detection throughout 24 h), changes in chest imaging (improvement in CT scan for lung parenchyma based on well-defined scales), as well as adverse drug effects (by questionaries and lab results). The median time of viral clearance was significantly lower in FPV group compared with the LPV/RTV group 4 and 11 days, respectively. The improvement rate in CT scans was only higher in FPV group on day 14 of the treatment compared with LPV/RTV group 91.4 and 62.2%. The FPV group showed fewer adverse drug reactions compared with LPV/RTV group, and no patients needed to discontinue the treatment [73]. Therefore, FPV stands as a promising agent in the management of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, three clinical trials are being conducted to validate further the role of FPV in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection (NCT04303299, NCT04310228 and NCT04273763). FPV is being investigated as monotherapy or in combination therapy. It is also being compared with placebo or other antiviral regimens. Examples of combinations are LPV/RTV plus FPV, darunavir/ritonavir, chloroquine and FPV combined with tocilizumab [83].",

RDV is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent by acting as a nucleoside analog that was initially developed to treat Ebola. A molecular modeling study suggested that RDV could be a potential therapeutic agent as the active form (CHEMBL2016761) of RDV has shown perfect docking scores among other antiviral agents [79]. It also showed promising in vitro activities by blocking the viral infection of SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by Wang M. et al., (EC50 = 0.77 \u03bcM; CC50 >100 \u03bcM; SI >129.87) [84]. A clinical case study for the first patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in USA has shown promising effectiveness of RDV [74]. Infusion with RDV was administrated to patients on day 7 after developing worsening in clinical conditions (pneumonia). The patient showed improvement in clinical symptoms, oxygen saturation and CT imaging scans [74]. Thus, RDV is currently one of the most promising antiviral agents for reversing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, about seven clinical trials are registered for investigating RDV at Clinicaltrials.gov and being conducted in USA and China (NCT04292899, NCT04292730, NCT04252664, NCT04257656, NCT04280705, NCT04315948 and NCT04302766). The studies have differences in patients disease conditions (mild, moderate and severe), treatment durations (5, 9 and 10 days), as well as the control group (RDV is being compared with placebo, LPV/RTV or LPV/RTV plus IFN-\u00df-1a) [85]. The safety profile for RDV is acceptable with GI symptoms and has the most common side effects, including nausea, vomiting and rectal bleeding. Some patients also experience elevations in liver enzymes [86]. A very recent case study was published showing the advantage of delayed administration of RDV to patients with severe SAR-COV-2-associated pneumonia. The patient received RDV on day 13 of symptoms and showed significant improvement in respiratory symptoms (extubation) after 6 h of RDV first dose [87]. An NIH-supported clinical trial is being conducted in the USA. RDV will be provided to patients as a loading dose of 200 mg on the first day of the study. Then, the drug will be given as 100 mg in the following days for 10 days. The patients' clinical outcomes from full recovery to death will be compared with the placebo group [88].",

A retrospective study from the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University has shown that the addition of arbidol to or LPV/RTV treatment significantly provided additional benefits on viral clearance and patients' clinical outcomes. Arbidol was administered at 200 mg every 8 h for the entire study group of 16 patients and LPV (400 mg)/RTV (100 mg) orally every 12 h until coronavirus had been reported three-times with negative results, while the control group (17 patients) received and LPV (400 mg)/RTV (100 mg) orally every 12 h. The combination group achieved higher viral clearance rates at days 7 and 14 compared with the control group (75 and 94% vs 35 and 52.9%, respectively). LPV/RTV, combined with arbidol, have shown antiviral effects in SARS-CoV-2 in other reports from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine [92]. This is maybe important as earlier viral clearance is associated with more prevention of severe lung lesions. Indeed, the patients' CT imaging at day 7 was significantly better in a combination group compared with control (69 vs 29%, respectively) [93]. Current ongoing clinical trials are further investigating the role of arbidol in the management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in different combinations, including NCT04260594 and NCT04286503 [94]. Clevudine is another antiviral agent that is currently being investigated in Phase II clinical trial for its potentials against SAR-CoV-2 [95].",

            "text": "Chloroquine (CQ) is currently being investigated extensively for its promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection [96,97]. CQ is an old antimalarial drug with limited use due to its resistance as well as poisoning risk (rhythm disturbance, QT interval prolongation) [98]. The derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was developed later and showed better clinical safety and lower risks of toxicities [99]. HCQ is also an option for the management of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus. HCQ is a highly available drug with a low cost and an acceptable toxicity profile [80]. Moreover, HCQ has good oral bioavailability allowing it to reach significant blood concentration that is sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. These properties nominate HCQ as a great candidate to be applied on large scale use such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. On the in vitro level, HCQ showed significant inhibition of the SAR-CoV-2 infection [46]. CQ and HCQ resulted in significant antiviral cytotoxicity in African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC-1586) (CC50 273.20 and 249.50 \u03bcM, respectively). The two compounds reduced the viral RNA copy number, with CQ being significantly more potent [100]. Another in vitro study has shown the potency of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with HCQ with enhanced potency (EC50 = 0.72% \u03bcM vs 5.47% \u03bcM) [101]. Suggested mechanisms of action include interfering with the pH-dependent steps of viral replication by increasing the pH of intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes and endosomes [96]. CQ also blocks the ACE2 receptor glycosylation and thus prevents the S protein binding [102]. Wang et al. have demonstrated potent blocking of SARS-COV-2 viral infection by CQ (EC50 = 1.13 \u03bcM; CC50 >100 \u03bcM, SI >88.50) [84]. CQ and HCQ also have immunomodulatory effects that might help in reversing the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm associated with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia [102].",

The clinical outcomes include time to clinical recovery, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, relapse after discharge, liver function tests, C-reactive protein (CRP), the incidence of adverse effects, days on mechanical ventilation, cost, among others. These trials are investigating CQ or HCQ alone or in combination with other therapies. Some of these trials published its outcomes, and some are still waiting for the results. Reports from over 100 patients in studies demonstrated that CQ showed excellent results compared with control. CQ treated patients showed lower viral load, better CT imaging, and shorter disease period [97]. The ongoing clinical studies, efficacy and safety of CQ or HCQ alone in treating SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated in ChiCTR2000030054 (a total 80 patients are enrolled), ChiCTR2000029992 (three groups: CQ, HCQ and control), ChiCTR2000029988 (severe patients/critical illness cases), ChiCTR2000029975 (CQ is given as aerosol inhalation), ChiCTR2000029935 (100 patients), ChiCTR2000029899 (HCQ vs CQ), ChiCTR2000029898 (HCQ vs CQ), ChiCTR2000029803 (HCQ as prophylactics to prevent SARS-CoV-2), ChiCTR2000029741 (CQ vs LPV/RTV), ChiCTR2000029559 (HCQ vs placebo) and ChiCTR2000029542 (CQ vs placebo) [103].",

            "text": "A recent protocol approved by the office of National Clinical Advisor, acute hospital division, recommended the use of CQ 500 mg twice daily for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases. Alternatively, HCQ in a regimen of day 1: 400 mg twice daily, then days 2\u20135, 200 mg twice daily (total duration 5 days). Another alternative is RVD as an intravenous infusion, 200 mg on day 1, then 100 mg on days 2\u201310 (total duration 10 days) [77]. A novel combination of CQ and azithromycin was used recently in a small French clinical trial [46]. About 36 patients were included, including asymptomatic patients, patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms, and patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms were included. About 20 patients received HCQ sulfate 200 mg, three-times daily for 10 days. Out of the HCQ-treated patients, six patients received azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg for the following 4 days. On day 6, virological clearance was significantly higher in HCQ compared with the control group (70 vs 12.5%). Azithromycin + HCQ group showed 100% virological clearance on day 6. However, this combination is not established yet. The risk of developing severe QT interval prolongation may be a limiting factor. The sample size in this study is small, and more significant studies are needed [99]. A very recent study utilized global affinity purification-mass spectrometry (APMS) analysis to identify the host-pathogen interferences for SARS-CoV-2, further validate the possible efficacies of CQ and azithromycin. The study showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein interacted with the sigma receptor. The sigma receptors interact with CQ. Azithromycin has also been shown to be an off-target activity to human mitochondria and ribosomes subunits that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein (MRPS27, MRPS5, MRPS25 and MRPS2 ) [106]. Another unusual combination that was proposed recently is nitazoxanide and HCQ. The studies on SARS-CoV-2 showed that the virus interfered with host pathways that are needed to activate the innate immune system of the patient to fight the infection (immune senescence). SARS-CoV-2 blocks the interferon pathway and prevents its upregulation in the host system. Nitazoxanide is antiprotozoal that upregulates the innate antiviral mechanisms and activates interferon pathways in the host [46,107]. Accordingly, the study is proposing that dual use of the HCQ with nitazoxanide would have synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2 [102]. The proposed dosing system is 400 mg twice a day for 2\u20133 days (loading) then 200 mg twice a day for 4 days for HCQ and 600 mg \u2013sustained-release (SR) tabs/twice daily of nitazoxanide for 7 days [102].",

            "text": "Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. It acts by inhibiting the binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptors. It has potent anti-inflammatory effects and already approved for the treatment of RA [110]. Tocilizumab is a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (BoDMARD) and recommended as an alternative to methotrexate or TNF-\u03b1 antagonists in RA patients [111]. Tocilizumab is well tolerated and associated with an acceptable safety profile [112]. Investigating its role in the management of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia is based on the inflammation and cytokine storm detected in those patients. Key inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IFN-\u03b3 inducible protein 10 and TNF-\u03b1 were found to be highly involved in the inflammatory storm inducing severe alveolar destruction and dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Elevations in IL-6 levels, in particular, were found as a significant predictor of fatality in patients [113]. Therefore interfering with IL-6 and other mediators may have potential clinical benefits in reversing respiratory dysfunction in those patients. A retrospective study from China hospitals demonstrated the benefits of tocilizumab in addition to the standard therapy of 26 patients with severe and critical care conditions [14,80,98]. Tocilizumab was given at a dose of 400 mg once through an intravenous drip in 18 patients. Another dose of tocilizumab was given for the last three patients due to the fever. Treatment with tocilizumab resulted in a significant relief of fever (100%), lowering of oxygen intake 75% and improvement in respiratory function. Tocilizumab normalized lymphocytes levels 52.6%, significantly decreased the C-reactive protein level 84.2% and improved the CT imaging 90.5%. The results from this study are suggesting tocilizumab as promising therapeutic agent for severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this study is observational study with limited number of patients. According to clinical trials are currently conduced to validate these results [114].",

Thus, it inhibits angiogenesis, which is an essential process for the development of new blood vessels to supply cancer cells with oxygen and nutrients [120]. Bevacizumab showed productive anticancer activities against colorectal, kidney, lung, breast and head and neck cancers [111]. Bevacizumab is also being studied as a candidate to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [23]. An ongoing multicenter clinical trial in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, China, NCT04305106, is investigating the use of bevacizumab for a severing of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. The study is enrolling 118 patients. Bevacizumab will be administrated in a regimen of 500 mg +0.9% NaCl (100 ml), intravenous drip (not less than 90 min) [121]. NCT04275414 is another similar clinical study that is also established in the same hospital with similar settings on 20 patients. However, the therapeutic benefits of bevacizumab are limited by possible serious events associated with its use. Bevacizumab was reported to result in new-onset hypertension, bleeding, delaying wound healing, thromboembolic events and bowel perforations [111]. These risks should be considered while repurposing the use of this drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Previously, corticosteroids have been used to treat the SARS-CoV outbreak with proven efficacy. Accordingly, it is valid to evaluate the role of corticosteroids in the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [122]. Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are expected to inhibit inflammatory response that is the main factor inducing lung damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, corticosteroids may suppress the immune response and delay the viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 [71]. To investigate their exact effects, a case study by Xu et al., in a 50-year-old patient that was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, showed that the administration of methylprednisolone (80 mg twice daily) to the standard care did not improve patients outcomes. The patients' symptoms continued to deteriorate over several days after the medications. Patients developed severe dyspnea and shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation was dropped to less than 60%, and the patient developed cardiac arrest and died [27]. A study included 80 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection received treatment of a single antibiotic (moxifloxacin) and RBV antiviral therapy. Only 12 patients received methylprednisolone to improve patients' shortness of breath. The study did not indicate any advantages for the use of methylprednisolone in those patients [28]. Another study was conducted on 46 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who received standard care of oxygen, cough relief, antiviral (LPV/RTV and IFN-\u03b1) and nutritional support. Of those, 26 patients additionally received methylprednisolone at a dose of 12 mg/kg/d for 5\u20137 days via intravenous injection. Three deaths were reported, and two of them received methylprednisolone. Patients received methylprednisolone, showed faster improvement in fever, a shorter period of supplemental oxygen and better absorption of lung focus [122]. Accordingly, methylprednisolone did not improve mortality outcomes but may result in a beneficial impact on clinical symptoms and recovery time. Until the time of this review, the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment in the management of SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, corticosteroids are not preferred as they may be associated with prolongation of viral replication, as noted in previous MERS-CoV outbreak [68]. Ongoing clinical trials are being conducted at this moment to confirm their role. ChiCTR2000029386 is a randomized clinical trial currently being conducted in China on 48 patients and methylprednisolone to be administrated to half of them like a dose of 1\u20132 mg/kg/day for 3 days [123]. Other studies also registered for Clinicaltrials.gov and currently in the process of recruiting patients. These studies include NCT04244591 (for critically-ill patients with severe acute respiratory failure (Steroids-SARI) in Beijing, China), NCT04263402 (to compare the efficacy of different hormone doses in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China), and NCT04273321 (to determine efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in SARS-CoV-2 in different areas in China) [124].",

However, due to the limited number of studies, it is still unclear how ACE2 is modified in SARS-CoV-2 infection [32,135]. Kruse has suggested that therapies that block the ACE2 receptor domain could be studied for their potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection [136]. For example, using the small receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the vital domain of the SARS S protein that has shown to bind to ACE2 [136,137] receptor. A second option is to administer an antibody that binds to ACE2, which could prevent SARS-CoV-2 particles from binding to the ACE2 receptor. A third potential option that has been suggested by Zhang and Liu is using compounds that have shown to inhibit ACE2 enzyme such as emodin and promazine [90]. Emodin is a natural anthraquinone compound that is derived from the commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs, such as the genus Rheum and Polygonum [138]. Emodin was found to block the binding of SARS-CoV S protein with the enzyme ACE2 [139], while promazine is an old anti-psychotic drug with structural similarity to emodin. Promazine has shown inhibitory signs for the replication of SARS-CoV. From these findings, Ho et al. have suggested that emodin or promazine could be considered as potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

This review focuses primarily on agents reported to be beneficial against certain RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, Ebola and counter inflammatory medications, as well as product reuse attempts. There is a broad range of products available in recombinant biotechnology to generate antibodies as well as in cytokines targeted at the production and transmission of virus genes and cellular receptors. A significant attempt will be made to produce successful drugs and vaccinations against current and possible future SARS-CoV-2 infections and other potentially pathogenic virus outbreaks to minimize the tremendous effect on human life. The epidemic of COVID-19 underlines further the importance of developing a relatively broad spectrum of antiviral drugs and the significance of implementing innovative strategies like artificial intelligence to expedite therapeutics development, considering the cost and effort involved in developing clinical drugs. As highlighted in this review, the abundance of publications and the fast publishing race associated with the virus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak suggests a concentrated initiative on the part of research organizations and the pharmaceutical industry both concerning molecular mechanisms and concerning therapeutic pathways used for current and potential coronavirus outbreaks.",
