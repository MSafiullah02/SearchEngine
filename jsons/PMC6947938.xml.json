            "text": "Intravenous catheter insertion is vital to managing critically ill patients, but it may involve a high risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI). Bloodstream infection, usually caused by multi-drug\u2013resistant organisms (MDRO), may be fatal and result in a long hospital stay and high treatment costs [1]. The most common pathogens of CR-BSI are coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp. [2, 3]. The incidence rates of CR-BSI range from 3.8\u201311.3 per 1000 neonate-days in neonatal intensive care units in developed countries, accounting for 30% of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in paediatric hospitals [1, 4, 5]. The rates are usually much higher in developing countries due to hospital overload, insufficient medical equipment, and unsafe aseptic practices by healthcare workers [6]. Guembe et al. showed that the CR-BSI rate in developing countries was 18.7%, while that of the United States was 0.1% [7]. Studies have shown several basic infection control practices such as hand hygiene, skin disinfection, dressing catheter sites, and appropriate intravascular catheters are effective in reducing CR-BSI [8\u201311].",

Our study not only implemented education interventions, but also included other interventions, such as auditing and feedback of compliance with aseptic technique and reorganisation of TPN preparation by preparing it under a laminar airflow hood in a clean room in DOP as recommended by WHO.

This could be due to our intervention of relocating TPN preparation from DON to a clean room in DOP and preparing parenteral nutrition under a laminar airflow hood. Birth weight and preterm neonates have not been identified as risk factors in this study or in other studies [9, 35]. Instead, we identified risk factors that included the days of intravenous catheters, intravenous injection, and the use of endotracheal intubation that were consistent with other studies [19, 25, 35\u201337]. Although the interventions in the study were shown to be effective, three risk factors are related directly to catheter usage. It is clear that catheter care and other BSI preventive practices should be regularly monitored and good practices should be maintained. The duration and types of catheters used for neonates need to be further studied.",
