The racial and ethnic composition of counties contributes to differences in the outbreak, with Black/African and Asian Americans being more affected. As expected, counties with a higher median age have a stronger outbreak, and so do counties with more people below the age of 18. Higher income, education, and personal health are generally associated with a lower outbreak. Contrariwise, obesity is negatively and significantly related to the outbreak, in agreement with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. Smoking is negatively related, but only directionally informative. Air pollution is another significant contributor to the outbreak, but population density does not give statistical significance.",

            "text": "First reports of a pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019. The virus was soon after isolated and identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but it proved to be extremely contagious, as the outbreak quickly spread beyond Wuhan. In the U.S., the first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was reported on January 22, 2020. In the struggle to contain the pandemic, the U.S. Government took unprecedented action, imposing international and domestic travel restrictions, closing businesses, and enacting state-wide stay at home orders and social distancing mandates. However, the number of cases in the U.S. grew to over 593000 as of April 14, and crossed one million on April 28. 1 The local popular press and epidemiological research alike are reporting differences in the outbreak, sometimes between neighboring counties (see Figure 1 and 2). 2, 3 Undoubtedly, a community's susceptibility to any virus is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to biological determinants, demographic profiles, and socioeconomic characteristics. 4 Because these factors vary significantly across the U.S., a considerable intra-country variation in the COVID-19 outbreak does not come as a surprise. For instance, COVID-19 fatalities in New York, an epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., disproportionally affect males and people belonging to older age groups, from Black/African and Hispanic ethnicities, and with certain comorbidities. 5 As of May 09, 2020, 53.0% of cumulative COVID-19 data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are missing race and 57.4% ethnicity disaggregation. Because information about many other individual variables is lacking as well, we deploy an ecological analysis using data at both the county-and state-level to determine the risks associated with several contextual factors in contracting the COVID-19 disease. We use a two-level hierarchical linear model with full maximum likelihood to simultaneously test and disentangle county-and state-level effects. We hope our study contributes to various strands of current COVID-19 research leading to a more thorough understanding of the outbreak. First, we note that contextual factors influence the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. at a state-and county-level. Significant variations in the outbreak exist both between states as well as counties within a state. 3 We recommend policy makers to look at pandemics from the smallest population possible for an effective implementation of countermeasures and provision of critical resources. Second, we develop an understanding of how cultural differences within the U.S. relate to regional variations in the outbreak, driven by specific psychological functioning of individuals and the enduring effects of cultural differences on the political processes, governmental institutions, and public policies. 6, 7 Third, we debunk rumors propagated in the popular press that a state's leadership, as expressed by the political party in control or the gender of its governor, has a statistically significant influence on the outbreak. 8, 9 Fourth, we identify how the virus affects counties differently, depending on their demographic profile. Income and education are especially important confounds in understanding the outbreak. Fifth, while many personal health factors show up as important confounds for the outbreak, we identify the prevalence of obesity and smoking in counties to be negatively related with the outbreak. Sixth, building on previous studies showing that air 3 pollution is linked to the death rate, we show that air pollution also contributes to the number of cases.",

The 21 cases confirmed on the Grand Princess cruise ship on March 05 and 06, 2020 are not attributed to any counties in California. For our county-level analysis, we discard cases which USA Facts can only allocate at the state, but not at the county level due to a lack of information. On average, the number of unallocated cases is only 308 per state (as of April 14), but a few states have as many as 4866 (New Jersey), 1300 (both Rhode Island and Georgia), or 1216 (Washington State). Following approaches by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington 10 and the COVID-19 Modeling Consortium at the University of Texas at Austin, 11 we statistically model the outbreak using the exponential growth equation = , where b is a positive constant called the relative growth rate; it has units of inverse time. Going forward, we simply refer to b as the outbreak rate. The shape of the trends in case counts enables us to see differences between counties. 12 Solutions to this differential equation have the form = , where a is the initial value of cases y. The doubling time Td can be calculated from the exponential growth rate as = ln (2) . We calculate the outbreak rate for 1987 out of 3142 counties in the 50 U.S. states that have a minimum of 10 reported cases as of April 14, 2020. This is a statistical, but not an epidemiological model, that is, we are neither trying to model infection transmission nor estimate epidemiological parameters, such as the pathogen's reproductive or attack rate. Instead, we are fitting a curve to observed outbreak data at the county level. A change-point analysis using the Fisher discriminant ratio as a kernel function does not show any significant change points in the outbreak, and therefore justifies modeling the COVID-19 outbreak as a phenomenon of unrestricted population growth. 13 A disadvantage of this statistical approach is that we cannot forecast outbreak dynamics, though we do not require extrapolated data in our work.",

In Italy, one COVID-19 study of 1,591 cases of critically ill people who were admitted into intensive care units showed that about 82% of them were men. 25 Other studies have found similar results, all of which point towards the finding that males may be disproportionally affected by .

Additionally, the health belief model suggests that a person's belief in a personal threat of a disease, together with faith in the effectiveness of behavioral recommendations, predicts the likelihood of the person adopting the behavior. 27 We use the percentage of the population that reports insufficient amount of sleep, is obese (as defined by a body mass index above 30), and smokes daily. Given the latter two are publicized risk factors for COVID-19, there is a potential for greater caution following the valueexpectancy concepts of the health belief model. Yet, medicinal nicotine has been identified as a potential protective factor against infection by SARS-CoV-2. 28, 29 We also measure the preventable hospitalization rate (that is, the rate of hospital stays for ambulatory-care sensitive conditions) as a potential indicator of poor personal health checkups; higher levels on the social association rate (that is, the average number of membership associations) are generally associated with more positive mental health and happiness.",

When using the outbreak rate calculated after 10 cases, the outbreak date as a control variable changes its sign and loses significance (p = 0.065). Notably, the following coefficients gain significance: government spending (p = 0.064); temperature (p = 0.011). Conversely, the following coefficients lose significance: household income (p = 0.989); food environment (p = 0.144); density (p = 0.709). More importantly, the signs of the coefficients remain the same. Also, the variable outbreak date controls for temporality of the outbreak in the original model (1.912, [1.322; 2.502], p < 0.001). Second, we iteratively include several other contextual variables and logged versions of the variables to assess the robustness of the results. But because it is nearly impossible to establish a complete list of confounding variables, we quantify the potential impact of unobserved confounds (Table 3 ; impact threshold). 35 For instance, the necessary impact of such a confound for air pollution would be 0.043, that is, to invalidate the variable's inference on the outbreak rate, a confounding variable would have to be correlated with both the outbreak rate and air pollution at \u221a0.043 = 0.207. Next, to alleviate concerns that some counties are omitted from the analysis because they are not yet affected by the virus, 30 we ask how many counties would have to be replaced with unobserved cases for which the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the contextual variables have no influence on the outbreak rate) in order to invalidate the inference. 36 As Table 3 (confound  threshold) shows, 43.962% of the counties would have to be replaced with counties for which the effect is zero in order to invalidate the influence of air pollution. In summary, it can be claimed that the influence of the identified contextual variables on the pandemic's growth rate is reasonably robust. Third, a potential omission of relevant variables can lead to multicollinearity issues, which are generally a serious problem in epidemiological studies. 37 Even though HLM 7.03 checks for multicollinearity, we conduct several additional diagnostics to eliminate any potential issues.

Most high correlations exist between racial composition and income and education. Additionally, we conduct a linear regression analysis at level 1 in IBM SPSS 26 (R 2 = 0.495; without variable math grade; pairwise exclusion of missing values), and find that the variable inflation factor (VIF) never exceeds the threshold of 5 (highest being nonproficiency in English, 4.024).

As a COVID-19 hotspot, they could unduly influence our analysis. All signs remain the same, and the following coefficients gain significance: household income (p = 0.009); persons under 18 years (p = 0.038). Fifth, because there is no statistically correct choice for centering decisions in multi-level models, 38 we retest our model with raw values. With the exception of the variable collectivism losing statistical significance (p = 0.711), the results are fully consistent with the group-and grand-mean centered predictors in Table 3 . Lastly, we are aware that an accurate estimation and comparison of the outbreak rate across units depends on similar testing strategies, test sensitivities, specificities, and reporting of tests performed vs. individuals tested. 12,39 Even within the U.S., some states report tests performed and others individuals tested. 39 The number of tests administered and the number of confirmed cases therefore correlates to varying extents across states. 40 By using a multi-level model in our study, we aim to accommodate such differences between states.",

It may be contrary to expectations that the outbreak rate of a new pathogen, which is able to infect virtually anyone, manifests contextual disparities. But for other conditions, such as HIV and cancer, regional health disparities have been reported before, 41,42 and with the current study we show that contextual factors in the U.S. also create a variation in COVID-19 cases. Our analysis indicates that higher outbreak rates can be found in U.S. states characterized by a higher cultural value of collectivism (coefficient 0.998, confidence interval [0.351; 1.645], p = 0.004). As Table 2 shows, collectivistic values are more prevalent in counties that are warmer (correlation with temperature 0.715, p < 0.001) and have a higher percentage of people with a Black/African background (with Black/African American 0.539, p < 0.001). This mirrors findings from international cultural research. 15 Conversely, we cannot find any statistical evidence that the government spending, the gender of the governor, or the party in control would be in any way linked to the outbreak. This certainly debunks myths spread by the popular media. 43 But a disproportionately stronger outbreak of COVID-19 cases can be found in counties with a higher percentage of Black/African (1.158, [0.725; 1.591], p < 0.001) and Asian Americans (1.305, [0.166; 2.444], p = 0.025), which supports prior infection and mortality studies in the U.S. and U.K. 22, 44 The former counties are also characterized by a higher rate of sleep deprivation (0.568, p < 0.001) and warmer temperatures (0.533, p < 0.001). The latter have a higher population density .

Studies report that people with obesity are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms, 45 but, to the best of our knowledge, a link to the infection rate has not yet been established. It could be that people with obesity heed the warnings issued by the CDC, and are extra careful avoiding social contact, in line with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. 27 Other studies report that smoking or medicinal nicotine might be a protective factor against infection by SARS-CoV-2; 28 Regarding age-related demographics, we confirm early observations that counties with an older population are more affected by the outbreak, with borderline significance (median age: 0.657, [-0.033; 1.347], p = 0.062). Notably, the percentage of persons under 18 years is positively associated with the outbreak rate, again with borderline significance (1.066, [-0.014; 2.146], p = 0.053). A possible reason is that younger people physically interact more frequently, closer, and longer with their friends, thus contributing to the spread of the virus. Conversely, we find no effect of differences in gender (0.167, [-0.880; 1.214], p = 0.755). None of these demographic variables are strongly correlated with any other variable. Air pollution is a significant contributor to the outbreak rate (3.329, [1.465; 5.193 ], p < 0.001), and, concurrently, counties with a rural environment experience a slower outbreak (-0.443, [-0.574; -0.312], p < 0.001). This calls for studies linking air pollution to the lethality of COVID-19 30, 31 to include the outbreak rate as a potential confounding variable. Contrariwise, a better food environment is associated with a higher outbreak rate (5.996, [1.286; 10.706], p = 0.016). While the food environment index is usually associated with a healthier lifestyle, better access to grocery stores and supermarkets in the vicinity also means more interaction with other people, and thus an increased likelihood of transmission. As a final point, we want to note that we have presented associations between contextual factors and the COVID-19 outbreak which are consistent with the deliberations leading to our research model. However, these associations, even when statistically significant, are not an inference of .

Ditto for the confidence interval. b) The effect size is calculated as coefficient / standard deviation, again multiplied with 1000. c) The variable for household income is divided by 10000. d) All effects for Math grade are from a separately calculated model because the variable is unavailable for 675 counties across the U.S. Consequently, run-time deletion reduced the number of level-1 records to 1140 and level-2 to 43.

Conversely, counties with more Hispanic Americans are less affected by the pandemic, with borderline statistical significance (-0.447, [-0.915; 0.021], p = 0.061). We could not find a significant effect for counties with a higher Native American (0.763, [-0.209; 1.735], p = 0.124) or Hawaiian population (1.478, [0.506; 2.450], p = 0.538) though. We see that higher income and education levels are associated with a less aggressive outbreak (household income: -3.854, [-7.437; -0.271]; p = 0.035; nonproficiency in English: 2.090; [0.547; 3.633]; p = 0.008; math grade: -0.002, [-0.004; 000]; p < 0.001). In counties with a higher household income, the obesity rate and the percentage of smokers tends to be lower (-0.518, p < 0.001 and -0.666, p < 0.001 respectively). Conversely, both are negatively associated with the outbreak rate. The effect of the obesity rate is highly significant (-1.093, [-1.828; -0.358], p = 0.004), but the effect of the percentage of smokers is only directionally informative (-0.784, [-3.150; 1.582], p = 0.516).",
