            "text": "The family Arteriviridae is grouped in the order Nidovirales together with Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae (Nga et al., 2011, Zirkel et al., 2011). The family Arteriviridae consists of equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV) has recently been discovered to infect Australian brush-tail possums and is believed to be most closely related to the current members of the family Arteriviridae (Dunowska et al., 2012), and three additional SHFV isolates have been identified in Africa that appear to be distantly related to SHFV of Southeast Asia (Lauck et al., 2013). The genome of arteriviruses is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA, and its coding strategy is relatively conserved but its length varies between 12.7 and 15.7 kb (Snijder et al., 2013). Two large overlapping ORFs occupy the 5\u2032 three-quarters of the genome and generate pp1a and pp1ab two polyproteins by the mechanism of \u22121 frame-shifting translation (den Boon et al., 1991). These polyproteins are self-cleaved to 13 (for EAV) or 14 (for PRRSV and LDV) cleavage products by papain-like proteinases (PLPs) of the nonstructural protein (nsp) 1 and nsp2, and by serine protease reside in nsp4 (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Snijder et al., 1993, Snijder et al., 1994, Snijder et al., 2013). The structural genes are located in the 3\u2032one-quarter of the genome; ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs 3 through 7, and ORF5a overlapping with ORF5, coding for GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, M, N, and ORF5a proteins, respectively (Firth et al., 2011, Johnson et al., 2011, Meulenberg et al., 1993, Snijder et al., 1999). The SHFV genome contains a duplication of the ORFs 2a, 2b, 3, and 4 downstream of ORF1b, and this gene duplication has been confirmed in the recent African isolates of SHFV (Lauck et al., 2011, Lauck et al., 2013). While pp1a and pp1ab are directly translated from the viral genome, structural genes require the synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (Sawicki et al., 2007). A \u22122 ribosomal frame-shifting translation mechanism has recently been identified in nsp2 for expression of nsp2TF for PRRSV, LDV, and SHFV, but it is absent in EAV (Fang et al., 2012b).",

            "text": "During infection of PRRSV, poor induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs are observed, and PRRSV seems to have a capacity to escape the immune surveillance for survival. At least six viral proteins have been identified as IFN antagonists regulating the innate immune signaling during infection: nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp4, nsp11, and N proteins. Among these proteins, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 are two most potent IFN antagonists (Beura et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2010, Song et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2012a, Yoo et al., 2010). nsp1 is cleaved into two subunits of nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, and both subunits suppress the type I IFN induction. In order for IFN gene expression, enhanceosome has to be first assembled, and CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding)-binding protein (CBP) is a key component of the IFN enhanceosome. CBP has been found to be degraded in the presence of PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 (Han et al., 2013), which is likely the basis for IFN suppression by nsp1\u03b1. As with PRRSV-nsp1, EAV-nsp1 has recently been found to suppress IFN response (Go et al., 2014), leading us to expand our study to nsp1 of other arteriviruses. We cloned individual subunit genes of nsp1 from PRRSV, EAV, LDV, and SHFV, and examined their IFN modulatory activities. CBP degradation was evident for LDV-nsp1\u03b1 and to some extent for SHFV-nsp1\u03b3. The current report describes the innate immune signaling modulated by arteriviruses with a particular focus on the function of nsp1.",

            "text": "The type I IFN system is a key component of the innate immunity and represents a first line of defense against viral infection (Samuel, 2001). PRRSV is sensitive to anti-viral effects of type I IFNs, and the treatment with porcine IFN-\u03b1 impedes the growth of PRRSV significantly (Albina et al., 1998, Buddaert et al., 1998). The sensitivity of PRRSV to IFN-\u03b1 varies and dose-dependent (Lee et al., 2004). LDV is resistant to anti-viral effects of IFN-\u03b1 in mice, which is probably a reason for its life-long persistence (Ammann et al., 2009). Arteriviruses do not trigger effective innate immune responses upon infection, and it may explain the weak adaptive response and viral persistence. Unlike other respiratory viruses such as swine influenza and porcine respiratory coronavirus, whose infections induce high concentrations of IFN-\u03b1, PRRS causes minimal expression of IFN-\u03b1 which is a hallmark for PRRSV infection in cells and pigs (Van Reeth et al., 1999), even though considerable variations are observed for different isolates (Lee et al., 2004, Miller et al., 2004, Nan et al., 2012). Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in anti-viral immunity by providing early innate protection against viral replication and by presenting antigens to T cells for initiation of the adaptive immune response (Clark et al., 2000), and thus IFN response in DCs by PRRSV has been studied. Monocyte-derived DCs are susceptible for PRRSV, and the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA is elevated in time-dependent and transient manners. However, a little or no detectable levels of IFNs are found in the supernatants and cell lysates (Loving et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2012). IFN production is observed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) after infection (Baumann et al., 2013). pDC is the primary cell type that produces IFN-\u03b1 during LDV infection (Ammann et al., 2009). For EAV infection, poor induction of IFN is seen in pulmonary endothelial cells (Go et al., 2014). For SHFV, IFN response is host cell-dependent. Up-regulation of IFN-\u03b2 production is detected in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and macrophages in macaques, but a low and no detectable levels of IFN-\u03b2 response is seen in macrophages and mDCs of baboons, respectively (Vatter and Brinton, 2014).",

On the contrary, a decrease of IFN transcripts is observed in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells (Miller et al., 2004). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are characterized by rapid and mass production of type I IFNs upon infection (Mildner and Jung, 2014), and porcine pDCs appear to be non-susceptible for PRRSV. In these cells, IFN production is blocked in the presence of TLR agonists when incubated with PRRSV, and the inhibitory effect is not altered by UV-inactivated PRRSV, suggesting the inhibition likely occurs on the cell surface (Calzada-Nova et al., 2011). IRF7 is not up-regulated by PRRSV in pDCs compared to other TLR (toll-like receptor) agonists. Another study shows no inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 in porcine pDCs by PRRSV (Baumann et al., 2013). In that study, both genotypes of PRRSV were used, and all test isolates of both genotypes induced IFN-\u03b1 production in pDCs by both infectious and non-infectious PRRSV (Baumann et al., 2013). It is possible that PRRSV prevents the paracrine loop of IFN induction and shuts off the IFN-boosted IRF7 expression while still inducing IFN production during the early stage of infection. Besides PRRSV, EAV has also recently been reported to inhibit IFN production with decreased IFN-\u03b2 transcripts in EAV-infected equine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (Go et al., 2014).",

TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 function at either cell surface or endosomal membranes and are involved in antiviral response (Baccala et al., 2007). When pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are sensed by PRRs, signal transduction is turned on to activate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and activating protein (AP)-1, and release of NF-\u03baB from its inhibitor I\u03baB (Baccala et al., 2007). Activated AP-1, IRF3 and NF-\u03baB are translocated to the nucleus and bind their positive regulatory domains (PRDs) within the IFN promoter region and instigate the production of IFNs by recruiting CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding)-binding protein (CBP) to form an enhanceosome complex for IFN transcription (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). Impaired production of type I IFNs has been observed during infection of arteriviruses.",

TLR7 is also thought to be essential for IFN production in LDV- and PRRSV-stimulated IFN response in pDCs (Ammann et al., 2009, Baumann et al., 2013). A study using EAV in specific gene-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggests that both MDA-5 and RIG-I play a role in counteracting viral infection (van Kasteren et al., 2013). In PRRSV-infected PAMs and DCs, expression of TLR3 and TLR7 is inhibited at early infection but restored later (Chaung et al., 2010). The TLR3 and TLR7 expressions are delayed in PRRSV-infected tracheobronchial lymph nodes (Liu et al., 2009), but no difference is observed in PAMs among different isolates of PRRSV for transcription of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 (Kuzemtseva et al., 2014).",

The dsRNA analog induced full activation of IRF3 in MARC-145 cells. When these cells were infected with PRRSV, only a partial activation was seen for Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) which is an adaptor molecule of TLR3 (Luo et al., 2008). For PRRSV-mediated IFN suppression, the suppression of NF-\u03baB activity seems to be involved during early in infections, even though PRRSV activates NF-\u03baB later in infection (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005, Song et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2010). Reduction of CBP is observed during infection of PRRSV, and this inhibits the formation of enhanceosome to result in transcription inhibition of IFN expression (Kim et al., 2010). PRRSV also inhibits the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In PRRSV-infected cells, nuclear translocation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) is blocked (Patel et al., 2010), and this is due to the disruption of nuclear pores by nsp1\u03b2. The PRRSV function to inhibit IFN induction seems to be redundant by different viral proteins including nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp4, nsp11, and N proteins (Table 1\n). nsp1 and nsp2 of LDV and SHFV also possess IFN suppressive activities. It seems that arteriviruses tend to employ a combination of modulatory function for innate immunity.",

For SHFV, pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12/23(p40), and TNF-\u03b1 are efficiently induced in macaques but not in baboons, which is consistent with the scenario of IFN production (Vatter and Brinton, 2014). TNF-\u03b1 is produced mainly by monocytes and macrophages. It is a pleiotropic cytokine important for induction and regulation of inflammatory responses (Hawiger, 2001). TNF-\u03b1 inhibits PRRSV replication in PAMs (Ait-Ali et al., 2007, Lopez-Fuertes et al., 2000), and thus induction of TNF-\u03b1 by PRRSV is controversial. An early study showed impaired production of TNF-\u03b1 in PRRSV-infected PAMs, and this was consistent with the findings in bronchoalveolar fluids after infection (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001, Van Reeth et al., 1999). However, TNF-\u03b1 is still detectable in PAMs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and bronchoalveolar cells (Aasted et al., 2002, Ait-Ali et al., 2007, Johnsen et al., 2002), along with the virus in the lesions of lungs, lymph nodes, and serum of infected pigs (Choi et al., 2002, Miguel et al., 2010, Rowland et al., 2001). Different breeds and ages of pigs also lead to differential expression of TNF-\u03b1 (Ait-Ali et al., 2007, Johnsen et al., 2002). In a study using 39 different isolates of PRRSV, various patterns of TNF-\u03b1 expression are observed (Gimeno et al., 2011). Another study also shows that TNF-\u03b1 expression was strain-dependent; a lower level expression of TNF-\u03b1 by highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV compared to the conventional strains of PRRSV (Hou et al., 2012). TNF-\u03b1 induction has been linked to activation of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase), or NF-\u03baB pathway (Mathur et al., 2004, Saccani et al., 2002), and PRRSV has been shown to induce a robust but transient activation of ERK (Lee and Lee, 2010). A later study shows that the ERK pathway, rather than the p38-MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, is associated with differential expression of TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages. HP-PRRSV suppresses the release of TNF-\u03b1 by inactivating the ERK pathway (Hou et al., 2012). This may explain the reduction of TNF-\u03b1 by PRRSV (Lopez-Fuertes et al., 2000).",

No response or minimal response is reported in some studies but a significant up-regulation of IL-10 expression is also reported in other studies. The up-regulation of IL-10 is observed in PBMCs, bronchoalveolar cells, and tissues including lungs and lymph nodes in PRRSV-infected pigs of different ages (Feng et al., 2003, Johnsen et al., 2002, Rowland et al., 2001, Suradhat et al., 2003). A significant increase of IL-10 is also observed in bone marrow-derived immature DCs (BM-imDCs) of PRRSV-infected pigs (Chang et al., 2008) and in PRRSV-infected monocyte derived mature DCs isolated from pigs (Flores-Mendoza et al., 2008). In PAMs, the induction of IL10 is time-dependent and dose-dependent (Genini et al., 2008, Song et al., 2013). During PRRSV infection, stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) including p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) are activated, probably through a post-entry process leading to activation of transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) (Lee and Lee, 2012). A later study confirms that the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways are responsible for IL-10 up-regulation in PAMs (Song et al., 2013). For NF-\u03baB activation, MyD88 is essential and thus the TLR-MyD88-NF-\u03baB signaling cascade is speculated to be involved in PRRSV-induced IL-10 expression. The N (nucleocapsid) protein is able to trigger NF-\u03baB activation and has been demonstrated to up-regulate the IL-10 expression in PAMs, and thus N-mediated IL-10 induction may rely on NF-\u03baB activation (Luo et al., 2011, Wongyanin et al., 2012). Indeed, NF-\u03baB activation by the N protein has been demonstrated (Luo et al., 2011, Fu et al., 2012, Pujhari et al., 2014).",

            "text": "nsp1 is the first viral protein synthesized during infection of arteriviruses and it functions in viral genome replication. Important domains have been identified for PRRSV-nsp1, which includes papain-like proteinase (PLP), two zinc finger (ZF) motifs, and a nuclease motif (Fang and Snijder, 2010, Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010). The PLP-like domain is found in the N-terminal region of viral polyproteins of many other positive-sense RNA viruses including picornaviruses, coronaviruses, arteriviruses, and pestiviruses, The PLP activity is essential for polyprotein processing (Chen et al., 1996, den Boon et al., 1995, Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Gorbalenya et al., 1991, Guarne et al., 2000, Harcourt et al., 2004, Karpe and Lole, 2011, Lim et al., 2000, Mielech et al., 2014a, Snijder et al., 1994). The PLP motifs exist in nsp1 of all arteriviruses and are responsible for cleaving nsp1 off from pp1a and pp1ab, and also for internal cleavage of nsp1 to generate nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 in PRRSV and LDV. Depending on the number of PLP motifs in nsp1, PLP is designated as PLP1\u03b1, PLP1\u03b2, or PLP1\u03b3 (Fig. 1\n). Correct processing of nsp1 by PLP1 is essential for viral genomic RNA and mRNA syntheses, and an impaired activity of PLP is lethal for PRRSV replication (Kroese et al., 2008). Unlike the leader proteinase (Lpro) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which cleaves the host cell eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) as well as itself from the nascent viral polypeptide, PLPs in arteriviruses hardly maintain their protease activities after self-cleavage (Guarne et al., 1998, Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010). The structural studies for PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 and PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 indicate stable interactions between the C-terminal extension (CTE) and the PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2 domains, hence further proteolytic processing is hardly conducted due to the inhibition of access to other potential substrates (Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010). In comparison with FMDV Lpro, a large interaction surface is observed for PRRSV-PLP1\u03b1 and CTE, which enables to stabilize the intramolecular complex in PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 (Steinberger et al., 2013).",

The zinc ion coordinating the C-terminal zinc motif is identified in PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 but the biological function of this motif is unknown. Mutations in the N-terminal zinc finger domain of nsp1\u03b1 selectively abolish the viral transcription whereas the genome replication is not affected (Tijms et al., 2001, Tijms et al., 2007). For PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2, no ZF is found according to the crystal structure. Instead, a nuclease activity is identified to degrade either double-stranded (ds) DNA or ssRNA (Xue et al., 2010). Recent studies show the involvement of arterivirus nsp1 in viral gene transcription and translation (Li et al., 2014, Nedialkova et al., 2010). EAV-nsp1 involves in controlling the accumulation of genome-length and subgenome-length minus-strand RNA for mRNA synthesis (Nedialkova et al., 2010), whereas PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 functions as a transactivator to induce \u22121/\u22122 frameshifting in nsp2 region to produce nsp2TF and nsp2N (Li et al., 2014).",

Later by in vitro translation and mutagenesis studies, the PLP motif was confirmed to mediate a self-cleavage of nsp1 from nsp2 (Snijder et al., 1993). Cys164 and His230 of the EAV polyprotein are catalytic residues for PLP, and Gly260\u2193Gly261 was determined as the cleavage site (Snijder et al., 1993). Unlike EAV-nsp1, two adjacent PLP domains, PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2, are found in nsp1 of PRRSV and LDV. PLP1\u03b1 mediates the internal cleavage of nsp1 to release nsp1\u03b1, and PLP1\u03b2 mediates the cleavage between nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 to release nsp1\u03b2. Their catalytic sites are predicted to Cys76 and His146 for PRRSV-PLP1\u03b1, and Cys76 and His147 for LDV-LP1\u03b1 (Fig. 1) (den Boon et al., 1995). The presence of two PLP motifs may reflect an ancient duplication during viral evolution (Snijder et al., 2013). The cleavage between PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 and PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 was initially predicted to occur near residues 164\u2013168 (den Boon et al., 1995), and later shown to be Gln166\u2193Arg167 based on the prediction from sequence alignments (Allende et al., 1999). Recent studies by X-ray crystallography (Sun et al., 2009) and mass spectrometric analysis (Chen et al., 2010) have corrected the cleavage site to Met180\u2193Ala181, and this cleavage site of Met180/Ala181 is conserved in type II PRRSV. The corresponding cleavage site of H180/S181 in type I PRRSV still needs to be confirmed experimentally. The cleavage site of Gly203\u2193Ala204 between nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 was also determined by protein sequencing (Xue et al., 2010).",

For cleavage of SHFV-nsp1, a 39 kDa band is identified in SHFV-nsp1 gene-transfected cells. This band is much larger than the prediction of SHFV-nsp1\u03b1 and is rather similar to the sum of nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2. It suggests that SHFV-PLP1\u03b1 may be non-functional. To verify this premise, a set of deletion constructs for nsp1 were made using a tag at the N-terminus of each construct. SHFV-PLP1\u03b1 appears to be inactive, whereas SHFV-PLP1\u03b2 is functional and cleaves off nsp1\u03b2, thus producing nsp1a and nsp1\u03b2 as a single protein (Han et al., 2014). We have termed this protein SHFV-nsp1\u03b1\u03b2. SHFV-PLP1\u03b3 appears to be normally functional and cleaves off nsp1\u03b3 from nsp2. Compared to PRRSV, discontiguous deletions of 55 amino acids between two catalytic residues of Cys115 and His130 are noticeable in the SHFV-nsp1\u03b1 region. These deletions in the relatively conserved region of nsp1\u03b1 may likely contribute to the functional impairment of SHFV-PLP1\u03b1. Another study shows that PLP1\u03b1 is predicted to constitute Cys63 and His130, and is functional to cleave off nsp1\u03b1 at Gly164\u2193Gly165 (Vatter et al., 2014). This study was conducted in the cell-free translation system, and the reason for difference remains to be clarified. PLP1\u03b3 is functional and generates SHFV-nsp1\u03b3 by cleaving at either Tyr479\u2193Gly480 or Gly484\u2193Gly485 depending on the experimental system (Han et al., 2014, Vatter et al., 2014). The cleavage between SHFV-nsp1\u03b2 and SHFV-nsp1\u03b3 mediated by SHFV-PLP1\u03b2 occurs at Gly350\u2193Gly351 (Han et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Among IFN antagonists of PRRSV, nsp1 and its two subunits are potent modulators for IFN production and signaling (Fang and Snijder, 2010, Sun et al., 2012a). The nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 subunits of PRRSV suppress IFN-\u03b2 activation (Beura et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2010, Song et al., 2010). Individual elements in the IFN production pathway including RIG-1, IPS-1, MDA-5, TBK1, IKK\u025b, and IRF3 are unaffected, suggesting that inhibition occurs downstream of IRF3 activation possibly in the nucleus (Chen et al., 2010). The total amount of IRF3 and its nuclear localization are not affected by nsp1. Instead, CBP is degraded in the nucleus and the CBP degradation is proteasome-dependent (Kim et al., 2010). Further studies show that the nsp1\u03b1 subunit is responsible for CBP degradation (Fig. 3B) (Han et al., 2013). PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 also reduces NF-\u03baB activation (Song et al., 2010). For LDV, EAV, and SHFV, nsp1 subunits suppress IFN production by inhibiting the IFN promoter activities (Fig. 2B and C; Go et al., 2014). The motif for IFN down-regulation in SHFV-nsp1\u03b1\u03b2 resides in the nsp1\u03b2 portion (Fig. 2D). The CBP degradation is also true for LDV-nsp1\u03b1 but is not seen in cells expressing nsp1\u03b2. The molecular basis for IFN suppression by nsp1\u03b2 or EAV-nsp1 remains to be determined (Han et al., 2014). Besides, all subunits of arterivirus nsp1 possess the suppressive activity for ISRE promoter. PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 interrupts the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the nuclear translocation of ISGF3 of the JAK (Janus kinase)-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway (Chen et al., 2010, Patel et al., 2010). The inhibition of ISGF3 nuclear localization by PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 is due to the degradation of karyopherin-\u03b11 (KPNA1) which is a nuclear import protein (Wang et al., 2013). Both PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 and PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 involve in the suppression of TNF-\u03b1 promoter activity through inhibiting the NF-\u03baB activation and Sp1 transactivation (Subramaniam et al., 2010). The functional domains in PRRSV-nsp1 for IFN regulation have been identified by mutational studies. Critical residues have been identified in nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 by alanine scanning (Beura et al., 2012, Subramaniam et al., 2012), and a highly conserved motif in PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 appears to be important for IFN suppression (Li et al., 2013). In our studies, PRRSV-PLP1\u03b1 and the C-terminal ZF motif in PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 are not important for IFN suppression, but the N-terminal ZF motif in PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 is critical for this activity (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with the finding that some of the N-terminal ZF mutants of PRRSV-nsp1\u03b1 are not able to induce CBP degradation (Fig. 3B) (Han et al., 2013).",

PRRSV nsp1 has been studied extensively for its role for innate immune modulation, and accumulating evidence show the alteration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs productions during infection. Type I IFNs are the most potent antiviral cytokines required for both innate and adaptive responses, and PRRSV suppresses the IFN production in pigs. This is probably the most important mechanism for persistence of PRRSV in pigs for a long time. At least six viral proteins have been identified as IFN antagonists for PRRSV, and their mechanisms of action have been studied to a certain extent. Further understanding on the viral strategy for immune modulation and evasion from host immune system is important, and balancing in vivo and in vitro analyses will be needed to affirm each effect.",
