As a neonate, she had hypotonia, microcephaly, pancytopenia, and congestive heart failure; the latter improved following surgery for correction of ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. Hydrocephalus was diagnosed at age 2.5 months on a head ultrasound performed for apnoeas and seizures. A right ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt was placed, but apnoea and seizures did not immediately improve.",

Although a viral illness provoked the episode, premature weaning of valproic acid likely increased susceptibility. Her clinical course was severe in that she developed malignant cerebral oedema leading to herniation, requiring craniectomy to relieve pressure. This occurred despite her already having a shunt in place which should have allowed for some additional protection from increasing intracranial pressure. The patient had pre\u2010existing epilepsy, so the presentation is not completely classic, as some authors feel the refractory febrile status epilepticus should be the initial seizure presentation (Panayiotopoulos, 2016), however, recent reviews have not outlined this as a mandatory criterion (Auvin et al., 2012).",

The overall frequency of epilepsy is approximately 25\u201350% (Wang et al., 2010; Weisfeld\u2010Adams et al., 2013). The epilepsy phenotype is variable, with focal seizures being the most common presentation, occurring in \u223c70\u201080% of patients with epilepsy (Biancheri et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2011). Focal or generalized status epilepticus occurs in roughly a third of patients (Biancheri et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2011). Other seizure types reported less commonly in cblC are generalized tonic\u2010clonic, myoclonic, tonic, and epileptic spasms (Biancheri et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2011; Weisfeld\u2010Adams et al., 2013).",

A study of febrile seizures found that serum B12 levels were lower in children with febrile seizures, with lower folic acid levels predicting febrile seizure recurrence (Ozkale et al., 2015). Exactly how abnormalities of the B12/folate pathway would increase febrile seizure risk is unclear, however, B12 deficiency can lead to symptoms of dementia (Smith and Refsum, 2016), indicating that global cerebral dysfunction is a possible consequence of imbalances in this metabolic pathway.",

Elevated serum homocysteine is a known risk factor for stroke, and can increase oxidative stress and cause endothelial dysfunction (Welch and Loscalzo, 1998). Post\u2010ictal hypoperfusion is a well\u2010recognized event following seizures (Farrell et al., 2017). In the context of already impaired blood flow, tissue damage may be exacerbated with hyperhomocysteinaemia, and could lead to the dramatic restricted diffusion seen in HHE. Of course, much more research is necessary to thoroughly explore this hypothesis.",
