This could be due to the differing mechanism of action of these drugs. While ACEIs block the synthesis of angiotensin-II, ARBs only block its action in certain receptors and do not affect its synthesis. Therefore, a high level of angiotensin-II in blood and tissues still occurs with the use of ARBs (versus low levels with ACEIs) 23 . It is known that there are different kinds of receptors for angiotensin-II, and the angiotensin-II receptor 1 (AT1R) is mainly blocked by ARBs. Hence, ARBs may not block the inflammatory effects of angiotensin-II mediated through receptors other than AT1R. Animal studies have shown that in order to fully stop the inflammatory effects of angiotensin-II, a combined blockade of both AT1 and AT2 receptors, as well as inhibition of its effects through the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway, are required 24 . Therefore, our results do not support the claims that ARBs could have a therapeutic role in COVID-19 25 . However, ACEIs warrant further study as a potential repurposed drug therapy for COVID-19.",

Second, even though all of the included papers were of good quality, propensity matching to address common confounders was performed in only two studies. In addition, there could also be a possibility of publication bias as all odds ratios were less than one (Figure 1 ), giving an asymmetry in the funnel plot. The other intrinsic problem of comparing one drug therapy to the other is that the indication of a certain antihypertensive usually depends on the presence of another coexisting comorbidity. For example, a comparison of RAAS inhibitors with non-RAAS inhibitors such as BBs might give a false sense of good outcome with RAAS blockers. This is because BBs might be commonly indicated as a rate controller for arrythmias that directly affect the prognosis. However, ACEIs and ARBs have fairly similar indications and our comparison of the risk between these two drugs should be more reliable.",

Poor clinical outcomes were less likely in patients receiving ACEIs (OR=0.73, 95% CI: [0.58-0.92]; P=0.01) than those receiving ARBs (Table 2). Compared to patients taking all other classes of antihypertensives, patients receiving ACEIs were less likely to experience poor outcomes (OR=0.77, 95% CI: [0.63-0.93]; P=0.002). However, we did not find a decreased risk of poor clinical outcomes in patients taking ARBs compared with those receiving all other antihypertensives (OR=1.13, 95% CI: [0.95-1.35]; P=0.02) (Table 2). The occurrence of poor patient outcomes was significantly lower in patients taking ACEs than those on BBs (OR=0.75, 95% CI: [0.60-0.95]; P= 0.02).
