These lesions were located within a mean of 4.7 (range, 1\u20137) cm from the dentate line. For the acute nature of the ulceration, without significant changes on surrounding mucosa, and their close to the anal verge in location, the rectal ulcers of AHRUS can be easily overlooked during the emergent or elective anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy by physicians who are not familiar with this special disease entity, which happened to five patients (Patients 1, 5, 7, 8, and 10). Therefore, high index of suspicion with retroflex inspection of distal end of rectal ampulla during colonofiberscopic examination (Fig. 1) are invariably required for the identification of these distal rectal ulcers. After the diagnosis of first case in 1989, only three additional cases were identified in the following five years (1989\u20131993).

These findings are identical to those of hemorrhagic necrosis of gastrointestinal tract in patients with cardiovascular dysfunction, shock, or sepsis at autopsy.7 Therefore, we concur that the pathogenesis of AHRUS may lie in a stress-induced disturbance of the circulation in the small intramural vessels, caused by secretion of catecholamines or vasoconstrictive gastrointestinal polypeptides as suggested by Ming.7 It has been well documented that severe physiologic stress (e.g., caused by major trauma, sepsis, head injury, burns, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, and multiple organ failure) often is associated with mucosa injury of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract8, 9, 10; however, compared with the higher prevalence of mucosa injury of the UGI tract, stress-related mucosa disease of the colon and rectum is relatively uncommon. For patients with stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding, the source of bleeding was found to originate from rectal lesion in 1.2 to 6.7 percent at autopsy.7, 11\n",

Patients with acute ischemic procitis often have clearly identifiable precipitating factors such as aortoiliac operations or shock, and suffer from abdominal pains.35, 36 Lesions are most commonly involved with segmental erythema and edema, with or without ulceration. In AHRUS, however, the surrounding mucosa of the rectal ulcers was either normal or only slightly hyperemic. Radiation, NSAID-induced, or trauma-induced rectal ulcers can be readily distinguished from AHRUS by a negative history of pelvic radiotherapy, NSAID use (oral or suppository form), and trauma (enema, catharsis use, and foreign objects insertion). It may be difficult to make a differential diagnosis between infectious rectal ulcers and AHRUS; however, the culture results of stool and biopsy specimens of our patients were all negative, and no typical nuclear inclusion bodies of biopsy specimens could be found, as is true in cases of rectal ulcers induced by herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus.23, 37, 38, 39\n",

There are many other less frequent and rare causes, including solitary rectal ulcer syndrome2 and Dieulafoy-like lesions.3, 4 Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome has characteristic histologic criteria: namely, the presence of fibrous obliteration of the lamina propria with disorientation of the lamina propria with disorientation of the muscularis mucosae and extension of smooth muscle fibers into the lamina propria.5 Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome causes massive lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage generally in seriously ill patients.6, 7\n",

In the study by Tseng et al., histology was retrospectively reviewed from margins of the rectal ulcers from 14 of 19 patients. The authors described necrosis with denudation of covering epithelium, hemorrhage, and multiple thrombi in the vessels of the mucosa and underlying stroma, without any of the characteristic features of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. To add to the confusion, the authors described Dieulafoy-like lesions through erosion in otherwise normal surrounding mucosa in two patients. Of interest, both patients had biopsies taken that revealed identical histologic features as patients with clear-cut ulcers. Histologic diagnosis of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can be difficult.",

According to the literature, these benign lesions typically behave as a chronic inflammatory disease with variable endoscopic features, including local proctitis, frank ulceration, and polypoid mass; however, characteristic histologic changes are as follows: fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria, hypertrophy of muscularis mucosae, displacement of glands and small cysts into the submucosa, erosion of the mucosa.1 To our knowledge, most of the information on this disease entity comes from studies in western countries. Researchers in western countries termed these benign rectal ulcerations \u201csolitary rectal ulcers\u201d and the corresponding disease entity \u201csolitary rectal ulcers.\u201d Most commonly, these ulcers affected young adults who had chronic constipation and straining defecation. The major problems are long-standing bowel disturbance and rectal bleeding. The intensity of bleeding is usually mild, and rectal bleeding requiring transfusion has rarely been reported. Cases of severe bleeding from a solitary rectal ulcer has been respectively reported by Delancy and Hitch2 and Haycock et al.3; however, no typical histologic appearance was seen. We suggest that the case reported by Delancy and Hitch were clinically similar to our presenting cases of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcers, whereas the case reported by Hancock et al. was an ulcer produced by pressure necrosis from a pelvic tumor and was pathophysiologically similar to the stercoral ulcer of rectum.",

The etiopathogenesis of benign acute bleeding rectal ulcer was unknown until now. Duff and Wright5 reported that benign bleeding acute rectal ulcers were associated with serious illness or injury, similar to the illnesses or injuries thought to cause stress ulcers of the stomach and duodenum. Kanwai et al.\n6 reported that rectal trauma, fecal impaction, ischemia, rectal prolapse, and idiopathy are the possible causes of benign bleeding rectal ulcers. We presumed that the 7 cases of acute bleeding rectal ulcers reported by Duff et al. and the 11 cases of idiopathic cause of bleeding rectal ulcers reported by Kanwai et al. were clinically similar to our reported series. From the viewpoint of demography, clinical characteristics, and colonoscopic findings, we suppose that both acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer and benign acute bleeding rectal ulcer were essentially a similar clinical entity and quite different from solitary rectal ulcer. We advocate the thesis of Fujimaki et al.\n7 that acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer should be regarded as a syndrome caused by various factors. We also agree with Tjandra et al.\n1 that further close examination on the colonoscopy, histology, and clinical characteristics of each patient is necessary to identify the real entity of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer.",
