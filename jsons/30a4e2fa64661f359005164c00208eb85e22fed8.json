The RTC is generated by 48 translation of the genomic RNA into two large polyproteins that are extensively auto-49 proteolytically processed by viral proteases to give rise to 16 processing end-products, termed 50 non-structural proteins (nsps) 1-16. Nsp1 is rapidly cleaved from the polyproteins and not 51 considered an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, but interferes with host cell 52 translation by inducing degradation of cellular mRNAs (10-12). Although it has not yet been 53 formally demonstrated, the remaining nsps (2-16) are thought to comprise the RTC and harbor 54 multiple enzymes and functions, such as de-ubiquitination, proteases, helicase, polymerase, 55 exo-and endonuclease, and N7-and 2'O-methyltransferases (13-18). Many of these functions 56 have been studied using reverse genetic approaches, which revealed their importance in virus-57 host interactions (19-23). In most cases phenotypes were described via loss-of-function 58 mutagenesis, however, in the context of virus infection, the specific interactions of RTC 59 components with host cell factors remain largely unknown. 60 4 A number of individual host cell proteins have been shown to impact coronavirus replication 61 by using various screening methods, such as genome-wide siRNA, kinome, and yeast-two-62 hybrid screens (24-28). Likewise, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens have been applied to 63 other positive-stranded RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, and identified critical host proteins 64 required for replication (29, 30). Some of these proteins were described in the context of 65 distinct ER processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, ER-associated protein degradation 66 (ERAD), and signal peptide insertion and processing. Although individual proteins identified 67 by these screens may interact with viral replication complexes, they likely constitute only a 68 small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment. 69",

            "text": "To capture the full breadth of host cell proteins and cellular pathways that are spatially 70 associated with viral RTCs, we employed a proximity-based labeling approach involving a 71 promiscuous E. coli-derived biotin ligase (BirAR118G). BirAR118G biotinylates proximal (<10 72 nm) proteins in live cells without disrupting intracellular membranes or protein complexes, and 73 hence, does not rely on high affinity protein-protein interactions, but is able to permanently tag 74 transient interactions (31). Covalent protein biotinylation allows stringent lysis and washing 75 conditions during affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric identification of 76 captured factors. By engineering a recombinant MHV harboring BirAR118G as an integral 77 component of the RTC we identified >500 host proteins reflecting the molecular 78 microenvironment of MHV replication structures. siRNA-mediated silencing of each of these 79 factors highlighted, amongst others, the functional importance of vesicular ER-Golgi apparatus 80 trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related catabolic processes, and 81 translation initiation factors. Importantly, the detection of active translation in close proximity 82 to the viral RTC highlighted the critical involvement of translation initiation factors during 83 coronavirus replication. Collectively, the determination of the coronavirus RTC-associated 84 microenvironment provides a functional and spatial link between conserved host cell processes 85 5 and viral RNA synthesis, and highlights potential targets for the development of novel antiviral 86 agents. 87 88 Results 89 Engineering the BirAR118-biotin ligase into the MHV replicase transcriptase complex 90 To insert the promiscuous biotin ligase BirAR118G as an integral subunit of the MHV RTC, we 91 used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system (32, 33) to generate a recombinant MHV 92 harboring a myc-tagged BirAR118G fused to nsp2. This strategy was recently employed by 93 Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2 (34). MHV-BirAR118G-94 nsp2 retained the cleavage site between nsp1 and BirAR118G, while a deleted cleavage site 95 between BirAR118G and nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein (Fig. 96 1a). 97",

Consistently, ER-associated 286 protein sorting complexes associated with the ribosome and newly synthetized proteins (Naca, 287 BTF3, SRP54a, SRP68) that were revealed in the GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3a, table S2) , 288 also appear to be required for efficient MHV replication (Fig. 4b) . 289 Furthermore, we also observed significantly reduced MHV replication upon silencing of core 290 elements of the 26S and 20S proteasome complex (Psmd1 and Psmc2, and Psmb3, 291 respectively), suggesting a crucial role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for efficient CoV 292 replication (27, 52). Indeed, this finding may provide a link to the described coronavirus RTC-293 encoded de-ubiquitination activity residing in nsp3 that has been implicated in innate immune 294 evasion (16, 17, 54). 295",

In non-infected L929 cells, ribopuromycylation resulted in an expected 321 diffuse, mainly cytosolic, staining pattern interspersed with punctate structures indicative of 322 translation localized to dedicated subcellular cytosolic locations (Fig. 5) . In striking contrast, 323 MHV-infected L929 cells displayed a pronounced enrichment of actively translating ribosomes 324 near the viral RTC as indicated by the strong overlap between the viral replicase and the 325 ribopuromycylation stain. Interestingly, active translation in vicinity of the RTC was strongest 326 during the early phase of infection at 6 h.p.i., and was observed until 8 h.p.i., before gradually 327 decreasing as the infection advanced along with the appearance of typical syncytia formation coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E or the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV (Fig. 6) . The HCoV-331 229E RTC, which was detected with an antiserum directed against nsp8, appeared as small and 332 dispersed perinuclear puncta during early infection and eventually converged into larger 333 perinuclear structures later in infection. Consistent with findings obtained for MHV, we 334 observed a striking co-localization of the HCoV-229E RTC with sites of active translation 335 during the early phase of the infection (Fig. 6, S4) . Importantly, our list of RTC-proximal proteins by far exceeds the number of host cell proteins 377 currently known to interact with viral replication complexes and the vast majority of MHV defined temporal roles during particular phases of the viral life cycle and proteins that did not 380 yet attract our attention in previous screens because of functional redundancies. We therefore 381 expect that this approach will find wide application in the field of virus-host interaction, target 382 identification for virus inhibition, and provides a starting point to reveal similarities and 383 differences between replication strategies of a broad range of viruses. 384",

Finally, we further 337 demonstrated that active translation is localized to the site of MERS-CoV RNA synthesis as 338 dsRNA puncta highly overlapped with the ribopuromycylation stain in MERS-CoV-infected 339Huh7 cells(Fig. 6). Collectively, these results not only confirm the spatial link between 340 individual components of the host cell translation machinery and coronavirus replication 341 compartments as identified by proximity-dependent biotinylation using MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2, 342 but they also demonstrate that active translation is taking place in close proximity to the study, we made use of a recently developed system based on proximity-dependent 347 biotinylation of host factors in living cells (31). By engineering a promiscuous biotin ligase 348 (BirAR118G) as an integral component of the coronavirus replication complex, we provide a 349 novel approach to define the molecular mircoenvironment of viral replication complexes that 350 is applicable to many other RNA and DNA viruses.351 We show that nsp2 fusion proteins encoded by recombinant MHV-APEX2-nsp2 and MHV-352 BirAR118G-nsp2, are indeed part of the RTC and localize to characteristic coronavirus 353 replicative structures. On the ultrastrurctural level, APEX2-catalized DAB polymer 354 depositions were detected at DMVs and CMs, and we observed co-localization of BirAR118G 355 with established coronavirus RTC markers, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8, by indirect 356 immunofluorescence microscopy. Notably, in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells the 357 detection of biotinylated coronavirus replicase gene products nsp2-10, nsp12-16, and the 358 nucleocapsid protein by mass spectrometry demonstrates that these proteins are in close 359 proximity during infection. This extends previous immunofluorescence and electron 360 microscopic studies that were limited by the availability of nsp-specific antibodies and could 361 only show localization of individual nsps to coronavirus replicative structures (4, 8, 35-37). 362 Moreover, the close proximity of BirAR118G-nsp2 to MHV replicative enzymes, such as the 363 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the NTPase/helicase (nsp13), the 5'-cap 364 methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16), the proof-reading exonuclease (nsp14), in MHV-BirAR118G-365 nsp2-infected cells further suggest close proximity of nsp2 to the site of viral RNA synthesis. 366 We thus propose that nsp2-16 and the nucleocapsid protein collectively constitute a functional 367 coronavirus replication and transcription complex in infected cells. 368 The analysis of the host proteome enriched at MHV replication sites revealed a comprehensive 369 list of host proteins that constitute the coronavirus RTC microenvironment. This included 370 several individual factors and host cell pathways, especially transport mechanisms involving 371 vesicle-mediated trafficking, which have previously been shown to assist coronavirus 372 replication. (24, 26, 27, 49, 52). Moreover, numerous coronavirus RTC-proximal host proteins 373 and pathways also have documented roles in the life cycle of other, more intensively studied, 374 positive-stranded RNA viruses, suggesting considerable commonalities and conserved virus-375 host interactions at the replication complexes of a broad range of RNA viruses (29, 30, 56). 376",

            "text": "399 Recent experimental evidence for Dengue virus supports this hypothesis. By using cell 400 fractionation and ribosomal profiling it has been shown that translation of the Dengue virus 401 (family Flaviviridae) genome is associated with the ER-associated translation machinery recent genome-wide CRISPR screens demonstrated the functional importance of proteins 404 involved in biosynthesis of membrane and secretory proteins, further supporting a pivotal role 405 of the ER-associated translation machinery for virus replication (30). 406 Compartmentalization of cellular translation to sites of viral RNA synthesis has been described 407 for dsRNA viruses of the orthoreovirus family, which replicate and assemble in distinct 408 cytosolic inclusions known as viral factories to which the host translation machinery is 409 recruited (58). The data presented here indicate that coronaviruses have evolved a similar 410 strategy by compartmentalizing and directing viral RNA synthesis to sites of ER-associated 411 translation. Likewise, this strategy has a number of advantages. Coronaviruses would not 412 require sophisticated transport mechanisms that direct viral mRNA to distantly located 413 ribosomes. A close spatial association of viral RNA synthesis and translation during early post-414 entry events would rather allow for remodeling the ER-associated translation machinery to 415 ensure translation of viral mRNA in a protected microenvironment. Viruses have evolved 416 diverse mechanisms to facilitate translation of their mRNAs including highly diverse internal 417 ribosomal entry sites, recruitment of translation-associated host factors to viral RNAs, and even 418 transcript-specific translation (59, 60). Accordingly, by remodeling defined sites for viral 419 mRNA translation, the repertoire and concentration of translation factors can be restricted to 420 factors needed for translation of these viral mRNAs. A microenvironment that is tailored 421 towards the translational needs of viral mRNAs in proximity to the viral replicase complex 422 would also make virus replication tolerant to host-or virus-induced shut down of translation at 423 distal sites within the cytosol. Finally, proximity of viral mRNA synthesis and translation can 424 also be considered a mechanism to evade cytosolic mRNA decay mechanisms and innate 425 immune sensors of viral RNA. 426 The novel finding of a close association of the host translation machinery with sites of viral 427 nsp2 -mediated labelling approach to identify RTC-proximal cellular processes that 429 significantly contribute to viral replication. Indeed, the ability of BirAR118G to label viral and 430 host factors independently of high affinity and prolonged molecular interactions enables the 431 establishment of a comprehensive repertoire reflecting the history of protein association with 432 the viral RTC, recorded during the entire course of infection. In future studies it will be 433 important to provide an \"RTC-association map\" with temporal resolution. Like we have seen 434 for translation initiation factors in this study, association of host cell proteins with the viral 435 RTC might not persist throughout the entire replication cycle but might be of importance only 436 transiently or during specific phases of the replication cycle. Given its short labelling time, 437 APEX2 indeed offers this possibility to dissect protein recruitment to the viral RTC in a time-438 resolved manner, i.e. to detect RTC-associated host proteins at specific time points post 439 infection. This will ultimately result in a dynamic, high resolution molecular landscape of 440 virus-host interactions at the RTC and provide an additional impetus to elucidate critical virus-441 host interactions that take place at the site of viral RNA synthesis. These interactions should 442 be exploited in the development of novel strategies to combat virus infection, based on 443 conserved mechanisms of interactions at replication complexes of a broad range of positiveused for the generation of MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 and MHV-APEX2-nsp2.

Cells were scraped off the flask and 551 transferred to tubes. Cells were kept on ice until the end of the procedure. Triton X-100 was 552 added to each sample to a final concentration of 2%. Samples were sonicated for two rounds 553 of 20 pulses with a Branson Sonifier 250 (30% constant, 30% power). Equal volumes of 50 554 mM TRIS-Cl were added to each sample and samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 555 18000 x g. Supernatants were incubated with magnetic beads on a rotator at 4\u00b0C overnight 556 (800 \u03bcl Dynabeads per sample, MyOne Streptavidin C1, Life Technologies) that were 557 previously washed with lysis buffer diluted 1:1 with 50 mM TRIS-Cl.

Proteins were eluted from beads by the addition 562 of 0.5 mM biotin and Laemmli SDS-sample buffer and heating at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. 563 For SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis, cells were cultured in 6-well plates and lysates were 564 prepared and affinity purified as described above. Proteins were separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-565 polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), and proteins were electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes 566 (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) in a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes 567 were incubated in a protein-free blocking buffer (Advansta) and biotinylated proteins were 568 probed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Streptavidin (Dako). Proteins 569 were visualized using WesternBright enhanced chemiluminescence horseradish peroxidase 570 substrate (Advansta) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 571 For mass spectrometry analysis, lysates and affinity purification were performed as described 572 above from 4*10 7 cells cultured in 150 cm 2 tissue culture flasks. Proteins were separated 1 cm 573 into a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A Coomassie stain was performed and 4x 2 mm 574 bands were cut with a scalpel. Proteins on gel samples were reduced, alkylated and digested 575 with Trypsin(68). Digests were loaded onto a pre-column (C18 PepMap 100, 5 \u03bcm, 100 A, 300 576 \u03bcm i.d. x 5 mm length) at a flow rate of 20 \u03bcL/min with solvent C (0.05% TFA in 577 water/acetonitrile 98:2). After loading, peptides were eluted in back flush mode onto the 578 analytical Nano-column (C18, 3 m, 100 \u00c5, 75 m x 150 mm, Nikkyo Technos C. Ltd., Japan) 579 using an acetonitrile gradient of 5% to 40% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 580 water/acetonitrile 4,9:95) in 40 min at a flow rate of 400 nL/min. The column effluent was 581 directly coupled to a Fusion LUMOS mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer, Bremen; Germany) 582 via a nano-spray ESI source. Data acquisition was made in data dependent mode with precursor 583 ion scans recorded in the orbitrap with resolution of 120'000 (at m/z=250) parallel to top speed 584 fragment spectra of the most intense precursor ions in the Linear trap for a cycle time of 3 585 seconds maximum. Spectra interpretation was performed with Easyprot on a local, server run 586 under Ubuntu against a forward + reverse Mus musculus (UniprotKB version 2016_04Lysine and on protein N-term, and deamidation of Glutamine and Asparagine. 590 Parent and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.4 Da, respectively. Matches on 591 the reversed sequence database were used to set a Z-score threshold, where 1% false 592 discoveries (FDR) on the peptide spectrum match level had to be expected. Protein 593 identifications were only accepted, when two unique peptides fulfilling the 1% FDR criterion 594 were identified. MS identification of biotinylated proteins was performed in three independent 595 biological replicates. For label-free protein quantification, LC-MS/MS data was interpreted 596 with MaxQuant (version 1.5.4.1) using the same protein sequence databases and search 597 parameters as for EasyProt. Match between runs was activated, however samples from different 598 treatments were given non-consecutive fraction numbers in order to avoid over-interpretation 599 of data. The summed and median normalized top3 peptide intensities extracted from the 600 evidence table as a surrogate of protein abundance (69) and LFQ values were used for statistical 601 testing. The protein groups were first cleared from all identifications, which did not have at 602 least two valid LFQ values. Protein LFQ levels derived from MaxQuant were log-transformed. 603Missing values were imputed by assuming a normal distribution between sample replicates. A 604 two-tailed t-test was used to determine significant differences in protein expression levels 605 between sample groups and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini73). GO BP terms with a p-value <0.05 were considered to be terms that were 612 significantly enriched in the dataset. Additional analysis of significant GO terms was conducted 613 using AmiGO and revealed that the top 32 GO BP terms (p-value <0.005) were predominantly 614 associated with five broad functional categories (cell-cell adhesion, transport, cell organization, 615 translation, and catabolic processes)(74). Alternatively, enrichment analysis was performed 616 using SetRank (data not shown), a recently described algorithm that circumvents pitfalls of 617 commonly used approaches and thereby reduces the amount of false-positive hits (75) and the 618 following databases were searched for significant gene sets: BIOCYC (76), GO (72), ITFP 619 (77), KEGG (78), PhosphoSitePlus (79), REACTOME (80), and WikiPathways (81). Both 620 independent approaches lead to highly similar results and consistently complement results 621 obtained upon GO Cellular Components analysis. 622 STRING functional protein association networks were generated using RTC-proximal host 623 proteins found within each of the five broad functional categories. Default settings were used 624 for active interaction sources and a high confidence interaction score (0.700) was used to 625 maximize the strength of data support. The MCL clustering algorithm was applied to each 626 STRING network using an inflation parameter of 3 siRNA library targeting each individual RTC-proximal factor (OnTarget Plus, 630SMART pool, 96-well plate format, Dharmacon, GE Healthcare) was ordered. 10 nM siRNA 631 were reverse transfected into L929 cells (8*10 3 cells per well) using Viromer Green 632 (Lipocalyx) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and fix on 689 ice for 20 min in buffer containing 50 mM TRIS HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 355 M 690 cycloheximide, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) TritonX-100, 3% formalin and protease inhibitors 691 (cOmplete Mini, Roche). Cells were blocked for 30 min in CB, and immunostained as 692 described above using polyclonal anti-MHV-nsp2/3 (gift from S. Baker), polyclonal anti-693 HCoV-229E-nsp8 (gift from J. Ziebuhr), or monoclonal anti-dsRNA (J2 MAB, English and 694 Scientific Consulting) as primary antibodies to detect MHV, HCoV-229E and ZIKV 695 replication complexes, respectively. Donkey-derived, AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-mouse 696 or anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) were used as secondary antibodies. Additionally, ribosome-bound 697 puromycin was detected using a monoclonal AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti-puromycin 698 antibody (clone 12D10, Merk Millipore). Slides were mounted, imaged and processed as 699 described above. 700 701 DAB staining and transmission electron microscopy 702 L929 fibroblasts were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with MHV-APEX2-nsp2, MHV-703 A59, or non-infected for 10 h. 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) stains were performed as described 704 previously (38). Briefly, cells were fixed at 10 h.p.i. using warm 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 705 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mM calcium chloride (cacodylate 706 buffer) and placed on ice for 60 min. The following incubations were performed on ice in ice-707 cold buffers unless stated otherwise. Cells were washed 3x with sodium cacodylate buffer, 708 quenched with 20 mM glycine in cacodylate buffer for 5 min. before 3 additional washes with 709 cacodylate buffer. Cells were stained in cacodylate buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml DAB and 10 710 mM H2O2 for 20 min until DAB precipitates were visible by light microscopy. Cells were 711 washed 3x with cacodylate buffer to stop the staining reaction. 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After three washes in 716 cacodylate buffer for 10 min each, cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (Chemie Brunschwig, 717 Basel, Switzerland) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and again washed three times 718 with cacodylate buffer. Thereafter, cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (70%, 719 80%, 90%, 94%, 100% (v/v) for 20 min each) and embedded in Epon resin, a mixture of Epoxy 720 embedding medium, dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA) and methyl nadic anhydride 721 (MNA) (Sigma Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections of 90 nm were then obtained 722 with diamond knives (Diatome, Biel, Switzerland) on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E (Leica, 723 Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and collected on collodion-coated 200-mesh copper grids (Electron 724 Figure legends",
