Among these studies on the effect of healthcare environment on patient outcomes, seven were on humidity; four on air filtration system; four on ventilation system; two on temperature; one on (increase outside air changes, improve filter efficiency, maintain constant temperature and humidity, increase positive pressure of operating room air). They 30 concluded that there is convincing evidence linking patients' clinical outcomes and built environment parameters. Zimring et al 32 identified a connection between the hospital indoor environment and patient and staff outcomes with respect to four sectors: staff stress and fatigue reduction and increased effectiveness in delivering care; patient safety improvement; stress reduction and improvement in patient outcomes; and overall healthcare quality improvement. Dijkstra et al 23 summarized literature on environmental stimuli (eg, furniture, art, color, nature, plants, gardens, carpeting, room size, spatial layout, private rooms, noise, music, odor, television/video, light, windows, and view from a window) and their impact on patients' psychological outcomes rather than on direct physiological outcomes. Huisman et al 25 reviewed hospital interior layouts and their relationship with medical staff error, patient falls, infection rates, indoor quality, comfort, building materials, visual comfort, acoustics, view, and privacy. They covered the indoor environment (eg, ambient temperature, humidity, ventilation strategies, and air quality) under the subtopic of safety and security, not patients' medical outcomes. 25 Previous studies related to the hospital building's indoor environment discretely focused on patients' thermal comfort, 35, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] acoustic comfort, 46 visual comfort, and IAQ. [47] [48] [49] [50] The impacts of single or multiple indoor environmental parameters related to the mechanical ventilation system on overall patient outcomes have not been summarized yet. Hence, this review covers the findings from the published scientific literature on the associations of temperature, relative humidity, ventilation rate, air filter, differential pressure, and ventilation strategy, with patient outcomes. This literature review considered articles published after 1998 and was restricted to codes, guidelines, and standards published by professional societies, licensing agencies, and regulatory organizations. Studies related to natural ventilation for infection control are outside of the scope of this review. Additionally, parameters related to building design, architecture, interior design, noise, aroma, and lighting are being excluded from the scope of this literature review, since this review exclusively focuses on parameters related to the HVAC systems. This review will help researchers, policymakers, healthcare, and building design professionals to understand the importance of indoor environmental parameters and provide information for enhancing standards related to the HVAC systems in attaining positive medical outcomes for patients. The review also identified avenues for future interdisciplinary collaborative research to quantify the optimum range for indoor environmental parameters considering patients' positive medical outcomes.",

[115] [116] [117] Higher ambient temperature is recommended during anesthetic induction and surgical skin preparation; conversely, a lower ambient temperature is recommended before surgical incision. 19 However, this method has limited effectiveness among adult patients because of the time interval for warming the room is relatively brief and requires wide swings in temperature to have a significant clinical effect. 122 A study on critically ill trauma patients confirmed that there is no correlation between the decrease of ambient OR temperature and patient core body temperature with effective use of active warming strategies on patients. 123, 124 Controlling indoor air temperature is crucial for other severely ill patients (eg, burn victims)",

Another simulated study showed that positioning the ventilation grills at the ceiling removes the aerosol more quickly than the wall ventilation system. 189 For downward air movement, Khalil 199 recommended the supply air outlets need to be located at the ceiling and the exhaust inlets on the opposite walls. The optimum location of supply outlets is crucial to reduce the residence time of pollutants efficiently. 95 In ORs, laminar airflow can limit surgical-site infections by lessening the bacterial air contamination. 65 ",

Published results contain contradictory findings, which made the comparative assessment difficult due to inconsistency in experimental design, choice of variables, location and settings, demographics, diseases, patients, and the types of outcome measurements. Hence, it is impossible to make evidence-based decisions regarding the optimum ranges to improve patient-oriented outcomes such as symptoms, morbidity, quality of life, or mortality. These contradictory results of the current research suggest that all indoor environmental parameters related to the HVAC system need to be measured or included in the comparative analysis of each study. Additionally, a common set of variables need to be defined for comparative analysis.",

A multidisciplinary study combining available molecular biology testing, advanced computer modeling, experimental testing, and on-site experimental designs could provide evidence to identify optimum ranges for temperature, humidity, and ACH along with appropriate ventilation design strategies. It is also necessary to address these variables as a function of spaces within a hospital since each zone has unique occupants and different functionality. Additionally, the structural variation of infectious agents (ie, viruses, bacteria, and fungi) may need to be considered separately when investigating airborne survival since each will have differing conditions under which they may be optimally suppressed. Finally, the relationship between IEQ variables, thermal comfort perception of patients, and airborne contamination need to be investigated. The health effects of ventilation in locations with highly polluted outdoor air and other diverse outdoor conditions present an important area of future research.",

Instead, the ventilation system design and the distance from the contaminant source are important factors than flow rate. 177 They 177 suggested uninterrupted path between the contaminant source and the exhaust to control contaminants.

This review summarized peer-reviewed papers on how indoor environmental parameters related to the mechanical ventilation systems of a hospital building impact patient outcomes.Higher indoor air temperature is recommended to control the survivability and transmission of most bacteria,75 fungi,69,71 and    viruses.68,69,[73][74][75]78 Low ambient OR temperatures are critical for patients, which lead researchers to recommend the optimum temperature to prevent thermal risk, with a minimum suggested temperature for ORs of 21\u00b0C (69.8\u00b0F),35,43 and a maximum of 26\u00b0C (78.8\u00b0F)128,137,235 or higher.235 Based on the existing literature, this recommended range varies depending on the types of surgery, patient demographics (eg, age, gender), and OR personnel.Most bacteria, fungi, and viruses persist longer at higher humidity (eg, >70%) and infectivity lessens exposure in the RH range between 40% and 70%.69 Higher RH (50% RH or higher) is recommended to control the transmission of lipid-enveloped viruses, for example, influenza.73,74,131 However, lower RH (50% RH or lower) is suggested for viruses without a lipid envelope.75 For most gram-negative bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumonia), higher RH (50% RH or higher) is detrimental to their survival, 69,75,134,144 except a few (eg, Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., and Salmonella Seftenberg).75,134 Similarly, higher RH is recommended to control airborne gram-positive bacteria.75,134 Figure 2summarizes the favorable RH ranges for the survivability of nosocomial pathogens and microorganisms. Higher RH is also suggested for hospitals to avoid thermal discomfort145,146 and other negative consequences due to dryness.35,63,128,145,146 It is evident from these findings that maintaining certain RH ranges may be detrimental for some microorganisms but favorable for others. Guidelines for humidity ranges in any hospital areas should consider both survival and infectivity of airborne-transmitted infectious disease control and thermal comfort.F I G U R E 2 Diagram of favorable RH ranges for different microorganisms This review found that ventilation rates, ventilation strategies, air filtration, and differential pressure control can contribute to the spread of airborne infectious disease in hospitals, although specific recommendations are institution specific. The evidence indicates that higher ventilation rates may reduce the infection rate in several situations. However, the maximum required ventilation rates (above which there is no further reduction of infection risk) at different spaces in hospitals are yet unknown,",
