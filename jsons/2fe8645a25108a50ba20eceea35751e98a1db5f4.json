The M13 bacteriophage is the most frequently used filamentous phage in PD applications and is characterized by having a cylindrical capsule that is primarily made up of the protein pVIII. The ends of the capsid contain copies of different proteins, such as 5 copies of the pIII and pVI proteins at one end and 3 to 5 copies of the pVII and pIX proteins at the opposite end. The viral infection cycle begins with the attachment of the pIII protein to the bacterium and the subsequent injection of the single-stranded DNA bacteriophage genome into the bacterium. Once inside the bacterium, the single-stranded DNA is converted into double-stranded DNA (the replicative form of DNA) by the replication machinery of the host organism. Subsequently, the DNA is replicated by rolling circle replication, and the resulting product is a single-stranded DNA molecule encoding the proteins necessary for DNA packaging into the bacteriophage capsid. 4 Finally, the mature bacteriophages exit the bacterium without lysing the cell, which is a characteristic feature of filamentous phages.",

The generation of a library of peptides is based on the triplet rule as well as the degenerative nature of the genetic code, where the alteration of amino acid sequences can result in a large and diverse repertoire of random peptides fused to capsid proteins. 7 Thus, this large variability makes it possible to construct libraries of peptides, proteins, antibody fragments, or enzymes.",

An efficient mean facilitating the direct application of drugs would allow the target tumor cells to be eradicated while preventing healthy cells from being damaged. In this context, diverse cell membrane proteins, such as growth factor receptors, adhesion proteins, integrins, and other markers are potential targets for tumor-specific peptides and subsequent peptide therapy. 11 Therefore, PD libraries can be large reservoirs of tumorspecific peptides capable of binding to tumor vasculature and cancer cells.",

An aFGF-binding peptide called AP8 was shown to interact with FGFRs as an antagonist and inhibited cell proliferation, as both breast cancer and vascular endothelial cells were observed to be arrested in the G0/G1 stage. 13 Another cell-surface protein associated with the progression and metastasis of breast cancer cells is CD44. Novel peptides that had been screened from a peptide library were shown to bind to CD44 with high affinity. 14 In addition, the expression of CD133, also known as Prominin 1, has been shown to be associated with cancer stem cells in humans and mice, making it a potential cancer biomarker. The peptide LS-7 (LQNAPRS) was screened and identified as a specific CD133binding ligand in a murine model, where in vivo experiments demonstrated its high specificity and affinity to murine CD133. Furthermore, LS-7 highly suppressed the migration of cancerous cells in colon and breast cancer. 15 In addition, phage probes against breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and ZR-75 -1) 16 and a novel peptide GYSASRSTIPGK, 17 which were identified using 8-and 9-mer landscape phage libraries, were able to bind to breast cancer stem cells with high specificity. In some malignancies, such as breast cancer, the abnormal expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (Her2) has been observed. By biopanning phage display libraries against Her2, a spectrum of ligands exhibiting a variety of sequences and motifs were identified 18 that are potential starting points for generating highly specific Her2-binding peptides. Thus, PD libraries are diverse reservoirs of tumor-binding peptides that may be useful in developing new diagnostic approaches and potential therapeutic drugs.",

The 3 phages, carrying the peptides DTDSHVNL, DTPYDLTG, and DVVYALSDD, showed high specificity and selectivity toward PC3 cells. 21 In addition, a splice variant of CD44 is considered to be a potential biomarker for prostate cancer because of its role during cell adhesion and tumor progression. In this context, 4 novel peptides were identified that showed promising characteristics, including high specificity and superior binding to the CD44v6 target on prostate cancer cells. 22 Fibroblast growth factor 8b (FGF8b) is a specific isoform whose expression is related to tumor growth, angiogenesis, and the stage of prostate cancer. Twelve FGF8b-binding phage particles were identified by screening a PD library against FGF8b, and a peptide called P12 in particular was identified that may act as a growth-factor antagonist. 23 The discovery of these target peptides may be useful for imaging and therapeutic applications, and phage probes may even have potential in either therapeutic treatments or the diagnosis of prostate cancer.",

            "text": "In 2018, a total of 2,093,876 human deaths were attributed to lung cancer and 1,761,007 new cases were diagnosed worldwide. 12 The conventional diagnosis lung cancer through lung tumor-specific biomarkers is ineffective and expensive. To address this issue, human lung diagnostic protein chips with novel screened biomarkers were developed using a T7-phage cDNA library, allowing patients with lung cancer to be diagnosed at the early stages of this disease. 29 Through in vivo screening of peptide-displaying phages, novel peptides targeting human lung cancer have been discovered using a mouse model to mimic the lung tumor environment. 30, 31 PD technology has also been an important tool in the identification of novel peptides targeting other types of cancerous cells. One of the most frequent malignancies that develops along the genitourinary tract is bladder cancer. In one study, the peptide CSNRDARRC was shown to be able to specifically bind to cultured bladder tumor cells. 32 In another study, the peptide OSP-1 was screened from a PD library and shown to specifically bind to osteosarcoma cells, with a target binding site that may be related to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Therefore, a properly labeled OSP-1 peptide may have excellent potential to act as efficient probe for cancer imaging. 33 Using a landscape phage display library, phages displaying proteins with specificity toward cell membrane markers of glioma cells in rats were identified. These results may allow glioma tissues to be profiled so that the therapeutic effectiveness of drugs can be increased and their toxicity decreased by designing anticancer compounds based on tumor tissue profiles. 34 Furthermore, following hepatitis infection, chronically infected livers may develop hepatocellular carcinoma. In this context, the use of a random phage display peptide library allowed potential biomarkers to be identified, such as an HC1 mimic peptide for early hepatocellular carcinoma. 35 A novel peptide called AAD (AADNAKTKSFPV) that exhibits high binding specificity toward gastric cancer cells was identified by biopanning the PhD-12 phage library. This peptide has the potential to be used to differentiate neoplastic and normal gastric mucosa, leading to an effective approach for cancer diagnosis via endoscopy at early stages. 36 Additionally, PD provides a high-throughput means of screening phage fusion proteins that are selective and specific toward PANC-1 pancreatic tumoral cells. 37 In summary, the peptides described above may act as a moiety for the targeted delivery of drug therapeutics or for the diagnosis or imaging of different types of cancer because of their highly specific targeting capabilities.",

These parasites infect red blood cells during the infectious process, causing physical and chemical changes in the plasma membrane of erythrocytes. A phage display library was screened on the surface of infected red blood cells, resulting in the identification of a peptide (LVDAAAL) that is a target compound for the development of antimalarial agents. 44 With respect to Plasmodium knowlesi, merozoite surface protein-142 has been a target for the development of a vaccine and for the diagnosis of malaria. In this context, a synthetic peptide library and a phage display library were used to identify and map relevant epitopes. This approach resulted in the identification of 2 epitopes (TAKDG-MEYYNKMGELYKQ and RCLLGFKEVGGKCVPASI) that may be potential candidates for immunodiagnostic assays and vaccine design. 45 Finally, a new interaction between the MSP1 N-terminus and glycophorin A of red blood cells was reported, showing that the MSP1-glycophorin A complex is essential during the adhesion stage of the parasitic invasion of red blood cells. 46 The process by which the malaria parasite is fertilized in the mosquito midgut and the corresponding molecular events has been poorly studied and understood. However, female gamete peptide 1 was shown to bind to the surface of Plasmodiumberghei gametes and suppress oocyst formation, making it a potentially useful molecule in the development of innovative transmission-preventing strategies. 47 A novel peptide was identified called peptide-salivary gland and midgut peptide 1 (SM1) that specifically binds to the lobes of salivary glands and the midgut epithelium of mosquito. Furthermore, it was shown that parasitic invasion of salivary glands was inhibited by the peptide SM1. 48 The components of the molecular apparatus involved in the interaction between host cells and the parasite Plasmodium during its life cycle are common targets and candidates for drug and vaccine development. Using PD technology, the insert EWGWS was identified in Plasmodium knowlesi ookinete surface enolase and was shown to bind to a conserved motif (PWWP) present in ookinete-binding peptides. 49 The findings may be useful for genetically manipulating the ability of the host mosquito to act as a vector of the parasite Plasmodium knowlesi.",

PD was used to identify unique peptide motifs that recognize both the human and rat forms of troponin I. These peptides may be essential for future clinical assays used in the diagnosis of heart injuries as well as in controlling cardiac cell growth in culture. 60 Heart failure can be associated with the inappropriate activation of mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart. Mineralocorticoid receptor-interacting proteins were screened for using a T7 PD library, and eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1, x-ray repair cross-complementing protein 6, and structure-specific recognition protein 1 were identified as novel mineralocorticoid receptor coactivators. 61 In addition, biopanning a PD peptide library against myoglobin allowed for the identification of markers that could be used in the early assessment of acute myocardial infarction, such as the peptides 3R7 (CPSTLGASC), 3R1 (CNLSSSWIC), and 3R10 (CVPRLSAPC). 62",

            "text": "The currently available diagnostic approaches are inefficient at detecting the presence and extent of traumatic brain injuries. PD technology was used to identify serum-associated traumatic brain biomarkers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, allowing the severity of brain injury damage to be detected and for recovery and therapeutic efficiency predictions to be made. 63 Additionally, PepC7 may act as highly selective peptide ligand that is specific for the brain vascular receptors in in vivo analysis and could be adapted for use in a drug delivery system in the brain. 64 A great deal of research in other medical and health fields have utilized PD technology. For instance, endometriosis, a benign disease characterized by external outgrowth of the uterus-lining tissue (endometrium) in ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestines, and bladder, affects women during their reproductive life. Novel peptides, especially RTRLHTR, which specifically bound to ectopic endometrium were isolated from a 7-mer phage display library, opening up new directions for the early diagnosis of endometriosis and the development of proper medical treatments for this disease. 65 In addition, because the regeneration of skin from severe injuries is currently a great challenge because of the limitations of the available treatment methods, the development of novel skin regeneration therapeutics is a currently active area of research. A novel small peptide called H1 that targets fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 IIIc was identified as a promising candidate for skin wound healing because of its high binding affinity. Additionally, H1 improved both the proliferation and cellular motility of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells in vitro and promoted skin wound healing in a murine wound model in vivo. 66 Based on these attributes, the peptide H1 may be a good therapeutic drug candidate for repairing skin wounds. Although insulin plays a major role in blood sugar control, it is involved in many other physiological events, such as the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, which are essential for skin health and wound healing. Therefore, a current challenge is the identification of therapeutic compounds that inhibit insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). In this context, PD was used to identify new peptide inhibitors of this endopeptidase, one of which greatly inhibited insulin degradation and enhanced insulin-associated events, such as the transcription, translation, and secretion of collagen in mice fibroblasts as well as keratinocyte migration, demonstrating the great potential of this peptide in therapeutic and cosmetic applications as a topical drug. 67 Activin receptor type 2B, commonly known as ActRIIB, is an activin type 2 receptor involved in cell metabolism proliferation, and differentiation, and whose protein interactions are considered targets for the medical treatment of muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia. Peptides with ligandselective ActRIIB antagonist activity were screened from a PD library and were shown to bind to the extracellular domain of ActRIIB, 68 inhibiting protein-protein interactions between ActRIIB and its ligands.",

            "text": "Currently, pharmaceutical technology allows peptides and proteins to be delivered to target cell, tissues, or organs via the parenteral, buccal, transdermal, rectal, vaginal, and nasal pathways. 3 However, the delivery of drugs to target organs or tissues is constrained by physical and physiological barriers, limitations that directly reduce the therapeutic index of drugs and even cause the rise of drug resistance in the case of infectious diseases. Therefore, spatiotemporally controlled delivery systems are needed that are needed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of drugs. To fill this need, viral particles can be used as delivery vehicles, such as the M13 phage, which has been used to combat bacterial diseases through the transport of DNA. This DNA sequence encodes Gef, a 50-amino acid cell-membrane protein that enables cell respiration arrest and for the apoptosis to be triggered, and ChpBK, which plays a role as an mRNA interferase by cleaving RNA, and its use resulted in the lysis of target bacteria in in vitro assays and in a mouse model. 69 Drugcarrying phages are an innovative type of nanomedicine that couple biologic and chemical constituents into a drug delivery system. Antibacterial phages have been used to successfully carry antibacterial agents such as the antibiotic chloramphenicol. These viral particles are nontoxic and had a greatly reduced immunogenicity in a mouse model. 70 Furthermore, the complete growth inhibition of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli was demonstrated using filamentous phages as target drug carriers. 71 Additionally, 2 novel bacteriophages (Str01 and Str03) that belong to the Siphoviridae family showed activity against health-threatening group A Streptococcus. 72 Important features, such as increased pharmacokinetics, stable formulation, and \"passive\" targeting of tumor cells are characteristics of liposomal drug delivery systems. Peptideassociated liposomes consist of 3 major parts: a drug peptide, a liposome carrier, and specific ligands. A novel feature of liposomes as nanocarriers was designed through their fusion with target-specific phage peptides. These phage-displayed peptides can be embedded into liposomes and used to produce tumor-specific liposomes and drug-loading nanocarriers. 73 Novel peptide ligands targeting high-risk neuroblastoma cells were isolated and characterized using a combination of in vitro and ex vitro PD screening against both neuroblastoma and tumoral cells obtained from murine models. Furthermore, combining the tumor-specific peptides with doxorubicinloaded liposomes caused a meaningful suppression in tumor volume and a promoted survival in neuroblastoma models in a preclinical study. 74 The in vivo PD approach, which was developed by Ruoslahti in 1996, has been a valuable tool used to isolate organand tissue-specific peptides that bind to cell markers or cell-permeating peptides. The use of in vivo PD allowed for the identification of the synthetic peptide ACSSSPSKHCG. This peptide enables efficacious transdermal drug delivery across skin thanks to the creation of transient opening in the skin barrier, allowing peptide drugs to be delivered to systemic circulation. The coadministration of insulin and this peptide on abdominal skin in a murine model resulted in increased systemic amounts of insulin and reduced glucose concentrations in blood. 75 Phage Display as Biotechnological Approach for the Development of Therapeutic Drugs",
