According to Lederberg et al,1 human demographics and behaviors, such as increased population density or individual behaviors (eg, sexual activities, substance abuse), can lead to the emergence of new infectious diseases. Modern medicine has benefited the human race at the price of millions acquiring nosocomial infections in hospitals. Food-borne illnesses, such as those associated with Escherichia coli, are caused by problems in food processing and handling. Economic development and land use can also lead to EIDs.1 One example is Lyme disease, a bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi) carried by deer whose population and contact with humans increased with reforestation. The breakdown of basic public health and sanitation can also cause deadly attacks of EIDs (eg, Ebola outbreak in West Africa, cholera outbreak in Haiti).1 Finally, international travel and commerce spread local EIDs (eg, SARS) across national boundaries.1\n",

Obar and Wildman4 define social media as services that are based on Web 2.0 technologies and largely rely on user-generated content, by which individuals and organizations create profiles and develop social networks online. According to a recent report of Pew Research Center, the percentage of U.S. adults using social media increased from 7% to 65% between 2005 and 2015.5 Globally, an estimated 2.34 billion people were social media users in 2016.6 Health communication researchers and practitioners have recognized the potential of social media in health education and promotion. A systematic review of literature7 shows that social media can be effectively used in health promotion in a number of ways, including providing information access, delivering health campaigns, and providing social support. Public health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO),8 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health departments have started to adopt social media in communicating with the public.",

EIDs represent unfamiliar risks to the public, who often turn to both traditional media and social media for information.9 How these EIDs are portrayed and communicated in media shapes people's perceptions of risks, which in turn have a significant impact on their decision-making process and risk management behaviors.10 Social media have been instrumental in informing the public about recent EID outbreaks such as the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009.3 Furthermore, social media users not only share EID-related information that they obtain from other sources (eg, traditional media), but also share their own personal experiences and understanding about EIDs. Because information about EIDs on social media are user-generated, such information is not always accurate or useful. It often contains rumors, misinformation, and conspiracy theories.11 As a result, the WHO calls for social media to be used more proactively in disseminating health messages to journalists, physicians, and the general public, particularly to counter misinformation about EIDs.8 To better understand the status of existing research on EID communication on social media, we posed the following research question: What is the current status of research on EID communication on social media?",

Next, the abstracts of the remaining 445 articles were screened by an author (B.B.) according to the criteria previously listed. Articles meeting one of the following criteria were excluded: (1) they were not written in English, (2) they were conceptual without empirical research, (3) they did not focus on EIDs, (4) they were only concerned with the contents of nonsocial media Web sites (eg, news Web sites), or (5) the social networking platforms under study (ie, discussion forums and online groups) were established by the research team specifically for teaching or research purposes. Studies on outbreak surveillance were also excluded from the current review. After screening, 71 articles remained in the sample. These articles could not be categorized as eligible based on the information provided in the abstract. Hence, the full texts of these articles were downloaded and read multiple times to ascertain eligibility. Two of the authors (L.T. and B.B.) discussed these articles to decide whether they should be included in the systematic review. Among these, 26 articles met the inclusion criteria. Reference lists from these articles were also screened, and 4 more articles were identified. In the end, a total of 30 articles were included in this systematic review. The earliest article was published in 2010 and the latest in 2016. Figure 1\nshows the article inclusion flow diagram.",

They examined the normalized weekly Weibo post numbers (ratio of illness-related posts and all posts collected) and found that Chinese Weibo users' interest in H7N9 doubled in response to the Chinese government's announcement compared with the previous week, but their interest in MERS-CoV did not increase significantly after the WHO announcement based on t tests. They explained this difference by suggesting that Chinese Weibo users paid more attention to H7N9, which affected China, than to MERS-CoV, which mostly affected South Korea. Househ27 compared the numbers of tweets and Google News articles about Ebola and concluded that the public's interest as measured in number of tweets was related to the number of Google News articles. However, this conclusion was based on observation of graphs only with no statistical support. Signorini et al23 used the number of tweets to evaluate the public's interest during an H1N1 pandemic and found it to correspond with the reported disease levels. Tausczik et al24 tracked the public's interest in H1N1 by measuring the cross-correlation of numbers of newspaper articles, blogs, and Wikipedia visits and an examination of the visualization of these 3 time-series measures. They concluded that all 3 measures were correlated; however, the public's heightened interest in the illness was first manifested in Wikipedia searches, then blogs, and finally newspaper articles, and the decline in public interest was first observed in blogs, followed by Wikipedia visits, and finally newspaper articles. Mollema et al40 studied the Dutch public's interest in measles during an outbreak in The Netherlands by calculating the Pearson correlation among the weekly number of tweets, other social media posts, online newspaper articles, and reported measles cases. They found that the number of social media posts was more highly correlated with the number of online news articles than with the number of reported measles cases. Towers et al34 studied the number of Ebola-related television news videos on 2 major news networks (MSNBC and Fox News) and the number of tweets and Internet searches. Using the Granger causality test, which is a test of whether one time series is able to predict another time series, they found that the number of news videos could explain 65%-76% of the variances in the number of tweets and Internet searches.",

Chew and Eysenbach14 identified the following 5 types of tweets about H1N1: resource, personal experience, personal opinion, jokes, and marketing. Manual coding of a small selected sample of tweets showed that resource was the most dominant theme, followed by personal experience, personal opinion, jokes, and marketing. They also tested the effectiveness of autocoding based on key word queries using Structured Query Language and were able to achieve around 70% correlation with the results of manual coding. Using the framing theory, Gao et al17 manually coded 7 frames used in health blog posts about H1N1: action, severity, conflict, new evidence, economic consequence, blame and responsibility, and reassurance. These frames were generated based on existing studies on news coverage of epidemics (eg, Beaudoin,45 Shih et al46). Mollema et al40 inductively identified and manually coded the following 8 topics about a measles outbreak in The Netherlands on a number of social media and found that these topics were discussed in descending frequencies: outbreak information, prevention, perceived risks of measles, refusal of vaccination because of religious reasons, criticism toward vaccination, trust, role of institutions, and unrelated information. Odlum and Yoon30 adopted a natural language processing approach, which allowed them to reach 5 computer-generated topics about Ebola on Twitter based on clusters of key words: risks, prevention, disease trend, and compassion. However, they did not report the frequency of each topic. Seltzer et al32 analyzed the texts embedded in images on Instagram and Flickr about Ebola and manually coded them into 4 inductively generated groups: facts (6%), fears (3%), politics (4%), and jokes (23%). Finally, Vos and Buckner37 coded the contents of H7N9-related tweets into categories derived from the crisis and emergency risk communication model and found that a large proportion of tweets about H7N9 contained sensemaking information (88.3%), but few contained efficacy information (2%). They used automated coding in KH Coder after a round of manual coding.",

Similarly, Mollema et al40 inductively identified and manually coded the following sentiments expressed on social media during a measles outbreak: frustration, humor, sarcasm, concern, and relief, in descending frequencies. Tausczik et al24 used blogs to monitor public anxiety about H1N1.

They used a combination of manual content analysis and supervised automatic content analysis using SVM and Naive Bayes. Gaspar et al39 studied how Twitter users coped with an enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Europe by manually coding the 12 strategies first proposed by Skinner et al,43 such as self-reliance, support seeking, problem-solving, and information seeking. They found that people tended to use different strategies in times of certainty and times of uncertainty. Freberg et al9 took a somewhat different approach by examining the kind of information about EIDs that people bookmarked online. More specifically, they studied the extent to which social media content of different information sources, of different document types, and on different social media platforms was bookmarked on Delicious through manual coding. They found that the CDC was the most bookmarked information source, blog was the most bookmarked document type, and Twitter was the most bookmarked social media platform.",

            "text": "Information about EIDs on social media is not always accurate or useful because it is user-generated. Five articles examined the accuracy of social media medical information about EIDs and interestingly all 5 studies in this category focused on YouTube. Among them, 3 studies were about Ebola virus, 1 was about West Nile virus, and 1 was about H1N1. Studies adopting this approach were not based on any specific communication or public health theories. These studies typically examined around 100 videos through manual content analysis. In general, approximately 70%-80% of videos contained useful information (either accurate medical information or outbreak updates) across different EIDs, such as West Nile virus,38 H1N1,22 and Ebola.31 Some studies further examined the types of medical information included in these YouTube videos, such as modes of transmission, screening, treatment, and symptoms.26, 29, 38 Very often, these studies tried to establish the relationship between content characteristics and popularity of videos. For instance, Dubey et al38 found that misleading videos had a significantly higher number of views per day, but Pandey et al22 concluded that there was no significant difference among useful videos, misleading videos, or updates in terms of views per day. Some of these studies also examined the relationship between the source and the quality of content and the number of views. Not surprisingly, Pathak et al31 found that independent users were more likely to post misleading videos, and news agencies were more likely to post useful videos. (See Table 5\nfor a summary of these 5 studies.)",

First, across a number of countries and around a number of different EIDs, the pubic expressed a deeply rooted distrust toward the government (as shown in Atlani-Duault et al,13 Ding and Zhang,16 and Tirkkonen and Luoma-aho25). To successful diffuse useful information and promote prevention and timely treatment, public health professionals need to recognize this distrust in government. They could enlist alternative spokespersons as the source of their information, such as physicians, researchers, or even celebrities. Second, it appears that governmental agencies did a good job providing up-to-date information about the outbreaks to the public; however, they do not address the fear of the public enough. Given the potential of using social media to assess the public's sentiments in real life, public health professionals could engage in 2-way communication and adapt their messages to address the feelings of their audiences.",

First, studies about outbreak surveillance, which is the line of research that uses user-generated social media data to track and predict EID outbreaks, are not included in this systematic literature review. This line of research has been making rapid progress; however, using social media data to track EID trends, such as flu trends, has its challenges. In 2015, Google stopped its Web site Google Flu Trends after they grossly overestimated the flu trends in 2012 and 2013. Second, this study reviewed only published journal articles. It is possible it has left out important studies disseminated in conferences, conference proceedings, or books. Finally, as the title suggests, this article is a systematic literature analysis. It provides an overview of existing studies on EIDs and social media, but it is not a meta-analysis and does not attempt to statistically integrate the findings of existing studies.",
