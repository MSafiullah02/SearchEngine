Although not examined through a period of acute losses, Bitcoin has also been shown to correlate positively with downward markets (Klein et al., 2018) , implying that it may act as a store of value during severe market declines. Moreover, Bitcoin is independent of monetary policies and, similar to commodities such as gold, limited in quantity by mining constraints. On this basis we hypothesize that Bitcoin acts as a safe-haven for the S&P 500 during the Covid-19 market downturn. The early empirical evidence regarding Bitcoin's hedging and safe-haven properties are not, however, comprehensively supported. Bouri et al. (2017a) demonstrate that Bitcoin has limited hedging properties and only has safehaven characteristics for Asian stocks. Baur et al. (2018) demonstrate that Bitcoin is mainly employed as a speculative investment. This speculative nature may result in selling pressure during extreme downward markets, providing limited effectiveness as a store of value (Yermack, 2015) . Given this background, we propose an alternative testable hypothesis: Bitcoin is not a safe-haven for S&P 500 investors during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

This important result is shown to hold across a range of different allocation weightings and periods.

These qualitative results provide an initial indication that Bitcoin investments may increase portfolio risk rather than acting as a safe haven. Table 1 highlights summary statistics for returns corresponding to the S&P 500, Bitcoin and a mix portfolio consisting of 10% Bitcoin and 90% S&P 500. For each of the periods under consideration we see that Bitcoin has higher returns, a larger standard deviation and greater excess kurtosis.

Regardless of the metric or confidence level examined, Bitcoin is found to have vastly greater downside risk than the S&P 500. Our primary interest is the change in downside risk for the mix portfolio, relative to that associated with the S&P 500. At a 1% confidence level, we observe a 13.6% increase in VaR over the 2019 \u2212 2020 period for a portfolio holding 10% Bitcoin relative to the S&P 500. Similarly, for CVaR at a 1% confidence level, we find a 15.3% increase from 16.18% for the S&P 500 to 18.65% for the mix portfolio. Similar findings are observed during the other periods examined. These findings, while limited to a potentially suboptimal Bitcoin allocation, highlight that Bitcoin may result in increased portfolio risk, discrediting the safe haven hypothesis for Bitcoin. 7 For robustness, we examine a comprehensive range of Bitcoin allocation weightings, with a focus on assessing the change in downside risk relative to holding only the S&P 500. The results, detailed in Figure 2 , focus on downside risk at a 1% confidence interval. For all allocation weights, we find increased portfolio VaR and CVaR for a portfolio containing Bitcoin relative to the S&P 500 alone. Moreover, relative downside risk increases monotonically for larger allocations to Bitcoin. Any allocation greater than 28% results in at least a 50% increase in the baseline level of downside risk an S&P 500 investor is exposed to over this period. Similar results are found for the other cohorts examined. Together with the earlier analysis, these findings provide strong empirical evidence that Bitcoin does not consistently act as a safe haven for the S&P 500 during times of crisis. Indeed, during the periods we consider, any inclusion of Bitcoin in a portfolio with the S&P 500 increases the level of downside risk an investor is exposed to. 7 The notion of hedging effectiveness receding at the very point in time when effective hedges are most required has been previously documented in the futures hedging literature (Spencer et al., 2018) .",
