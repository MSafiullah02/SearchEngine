            "text": "Human infection with the novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus has been occurring since February 2013, in eastern China [1]. To date, 1220 people have been infected with the influenza A (H7N9) virus, and 494 people have died [2]. Although outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5 infection in wild birds and poultry and H7 subtype infections in poultry have occurred worldwide, most of them are mild or asymptomatic in humans, except for death associated with H5N1 and H7N7 subtype infections [3\u20135]. Although in the early stage of illness, the genetic analysis of several patients\u2019 isolates has indicated that high pathogenicity of avian-origin H7N9 virus in humans, but not poultry, is more likely to result from viral genome variation [1, 6]; the viral gene variation of long-term shedding is poorly elucidated. In the virus genome, the mutation of Q226L could increase the binding affinity to a human-type receptor (\u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors), and cleavage sites might be associated with alteration of receptor specificity from avian origin to a human-type receptor [7\u20139]. Previous studies concerning H5N1 or H1N1 led to the concept that PB2-627K or PB2-701N mutations are critical for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals\u2019 efficient replication in mammals [10\u201312]. Other key amino acids such as 591K of PB2 can compensate for the lack of lysine at position 627 and confer efficient viral replication to some H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in mammals [13].",

            "text": "Effective antiviral drugs are essential for the early control of an influenza virus pandemic and the spread of infection [14, 15]. There are two classes of antivirals available for influenza prophylaxis and treatment, M2-ion channel blockers adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) [16]. The possible threat posed by amantadine and rimantadine-resistant and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses has been verified in H1N1 and H5N1 [16\u201318]. Mutations in S31N in the M2 gene and R292K in the NA gene were noted in several patients\u2019 isolates [1, 6], suggesting that the emergence of drug-resistant variants should be closely monitored. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the viral gene mutation in specimens originating from one patient with different specimen types and time points is important in understanding the determinants of virulence and transmissibility. In this study, we collected a total of 198 throat swabs, sputum specimens, and stool specimens from 31 patients with laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infection daily after hospital admission whenever available. We noted mutations in the NA, PB2, HA, and M2 genes from 113 clinical specimens whose gene sequences were amplified and sequenced successfully. We summarized the emergence frequency of each substitution in the related genes. Furthermore, we analyzed the viral shedding duration before or after oseltamivir treatment in NA-R292K mutant and NA-R292 wild-type patients.",

The emergence of E627K (30 of 31 patients, 96.8%) substitution seemed to be more frequent than Q591K (3 of 31 patients, 9.7%) and D701N (5 of 31 patients, 16.1%) in PB2, and mutations emerging simultaneously at both the 627 and 701 sites in PB2 rarely occurred (only 2 among 113 specimens). Seven (22.6%) of 31 patients harbored R292K mutations in the NA gene. Prolonged viral shedding duration was reported in R292K mutant patients, even after receipt of oseltamivir therapy. Although there were no statistically significant differences in clinical features between those with or without the NA-R292K mutation because of limited numbers, the severe illness conditions and high lethality of NA-R292K mutant patients should also be considered.",

Unlike other types of avian influenza virus affecting human beings, infection with the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus in humans did not cause an increase in poultry deaths. Therefore, the key concerns about the current outbreak of influenza A (H7N9) virus are how the virus crosses the species barrier. The sequence analysis of H7N9 for several patients by our previous study and Gao\u2019s group reported that the Q226L mutation in HA and the lack of a glycosylation site (cleavage site) were more likely to change the avian origin receptor to an alpha 2,6 human-like receptor and might decrease the ability of the virus to be transmitted by air [1, 6]. The Q226L mutation in HA was also detected in all 63 specimens from 26 patients in our study. The lack of a cleavage site in HA was also found in the H7N9 virus in all specimens. The 100% emergence frequency of Q226L and cleavage site in HA in our current study indicated that the emergence of those viral variants was not a chance happening under certain circumstances. The absence of the multibasic amino acid motif of the HA cleavage site which is a key virulence marker in birds, endows the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and H7N7 viruses with multiorgan tropism [19], but whether it is a virulence marker in people needs to be further confirmed [6]. The substitution of Q591K, E627K, or D701N of PB2 is associated with mammalian adaptation and efficient replication and transmission and is found in all H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 influenza viruses that infect humans [13, 20, 21]. Mutations in E627K or D701N were also identified in cases of infection in the Shanghai, Anhui, and Zhejiang H7N9 isolates [1, 6]. We found that the mutation of Q591K was also present in the H7N9 virus. In addition, the simultaneous emergence of E627K and D701N identified in our study rarely occurred. The characteristics of the adaptation and efficient replication ability of this virus may enhance H7N9 influenza viruses, contributing to the prolonged duration of viral shedding and severe disease in almost all patients.",

We also detected seven patients harboring the neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant associating R292K mutation. The emergence of the R292K mutation was detected from 1 day (range 1\u201312 days) after oseltamivir treatment. As we could not collect the specimens and detect R292K before oseltamivir treatment, whether the R292K mutation occurred naturally or drug-induced could not be determined. The latest study showed that the emergence of an NA-R292K mutation infected with H7N9 was temporally associated with a high rebound virus load, treatment failure, and a poor clinical outcome [22]. We did not quantify the viral load in this study but did find that the emergence of the NA-R292K mutation delayed the viral shedding duration for the NA-R292K mutant patients, affecting the effects of antiviral therapy. Furthermore, recent and previous studies indicated that early oseltamivir treatment started 2 days before for H7N9 or 4 days before for H1N1 after disease onset would decrease the virus load or shorten the duration of viral shedding [14, 22]. In our study, the median initial time of oseltamivir treatment after symptom onset was 7 and 6 days for the two groups of patients. The extended time of hospital visit time for the patients may be one reason for prolonged viral shedding duration.",
