Ten years later, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) outbroke in Arabian Peninsula and overspread mainly in the Middle East, affecting more than 2000 people.\n1\n These two outbreaks demonstrated the high transmissibility and pathogenicity of emerging coronaviruses (CoVs). Since late December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause that started in Wuhan, Hubei, China has been attracting tremendous attention. The pathogen of this unexplained pneumonia was isolated from human airway epithelial cells and identified as a novel CoV, named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 a public health emergency of international concern on 5 February 2020 and more recently, a pandemic. By 18 March 2020, WHO confirmed a total of 191 127 cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and 7807 deaths worldwide. Among them, 91 845 confirmed cases were distributed in Western Pacific region and 74 760 were in European region.\n4\n Rapid and accurate diagnosis of the causative viral pathogen is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission.",

Specimen types of patients with respiratory virus infection are diverse. Viral RNA could be detected in upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), stool, blood, and urine of SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected persons. Among them, URT specimens, as well as available LRT specimens in severely affected patients must be collected for diagnosis and should be tested repeatedly if the first testing is negative in patients with epidemiological history and suspected symptoms of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. It was reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA could be detected in stool, blood, or urine even if it could not be detected in URT specimens,23, 24 so collecting stool, blood or urine samples if condition permits is helpful to improve positive rate when LRT specimens are unavailable. To demonstrate viral clearance during treatment, samples should also be collected and tested repeatedly. WHO recommended that the frequency of specimen collection should be at least every 2 to 4 days until there are two consecutive negative results in a clinically recovered patient at least 24 hours apart.\n25\n Also, Chinese National Health Commission and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that negative results of real time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) testing for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected at least 24 hours apart can be considered to discontinue transmission\u2010based precautions.25, 26\n",

For URT and sputum samples, sample quality depends greatly on the operation of the collectors. Firstly, synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts and sterile container were recommended to use when collecting, while calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts should not be used as they may contain substances that inactivate viruses and inhibit PCR testing.\n27\n Secondly, to get enough virus infected cells, swabs must be inserted deep enough. In detail, nasopharyngeal (NP) swab must be inserted through the nares parallel to the palate, and oropharyngeal (OP) swab needs to be inserted into posterior pharynx and tonsillar areas.28, 29 Several studies have reported that combined NP and OP specimens could increase the sensitivity of detecting respiratory viruses.30, 31, 32 As seen in Table 1, although using different RT\u2010PCR methods targeting different genes, the threshold cycle (CT) value of NP and OP swabs was much lower than NP or OP swab alone, suggesting that in accordance with other respiratory viruses, combining NP and OP swabs together could increase viral load and the sensitivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA detection. Sputum is often confused with saliva. Although SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could be detected in saliva,\n33\n sputum is preferred by several guidelines.27, 29, 34 Patients should cough deeply so that sputum rather than oral secretions is collected. Dehydration may lessen the fluid in the lungs and make it hard to produce sputum, hence drinking water before collection can increase availability. To avoid contamination, all types of samples must be transported in sterile containers. To ensure sample stability, storage condition should be strictly controlled, which is summarized with other key points of specimen collection in Table 2.",

For isolation and culture of virus, centrifuging samples to remove cellular debris, and then inoculating the supernatant on human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 cells or Huh\u20107 cells. It took about 96 hours for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to be successfully cultured in human airway epithelial cells, and took about 6 days to be cultured in Vero E6 or Huh\u20107 cells.10, 22 The isolation and culture should be conducted at BSL\u20103, and laboratory workers should wear protective equipment, including disposable gloves, solid front or wrap\u2010around gowns, scrub suits, or coveralls with sleeves that fully cover the forearms, head coverings, shoe covers or dedicated shoes, eye protection, and respiratory protection.\n35\n Inactivation of viruses without reducing detection efficiency is required for testing RNA of high pathogenic CoVs at BSL\u20102 and protecting experimenters from infection. Trizol, Trizol LS (Life Technologies), and buffer AVL (Qiagen) have been standard methodology for purifying and extracting viral RNA for years. Guanidine salt in these agents can inhibit nuclease, thereby ensuring viral RNA is not degraded. Viral RNA in samples placed in buffer AVL was stable for at least 48 hours at 32\u00b0C, and at least 35 days at either 4\u00b0C or \u221220\u00b0C.\n36\n In addition, the powerful denaturing activity of guanidine isothiocyanate in these reagents could denature and dissolve protein, thus effectively inactivating enveloped viruses. The phenol component of Trizol could also disrupt membranes and denature proteins. These reagents were shown to inactivate alphaviruses, flaviviruses, filoviruses, bunyaviruses, and ebola virus.37, 38, 39 Kumar, et al. confirmed that AVL, Trizol and Trizol LS could completely inactivate MERS\u2010CoV within 10 minutes' room temperature incubation.\n40\n Thus, although many methods have been verified to effectively inactivate SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV,\n41\n we suggest handling samples in these reagents, as well as other virus retention reagents containing guanidine salt would be an effective way to inactivate and stabilize viruses, without affecting subsequent molecular testing of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Since CoVs are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples could effectively inactive virus if SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibody needs to be tested at BSL\u20102. However, it should be noticed that heat inactivation could significantly interfere with the levels of antibodies, and might cause false\u2010negative results. It was reported that the anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM levels of all samples decreased by an average level of 53.56%, and the IgG levels were decreased in 64.71% samples by an average level of 49.54% after heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes.\n42\n\n",

For SARS\u2010CoV, which are also suitable for other viruses, WHO recommended one negative control and one positive control for extraction, one water control and one positive control for a PCR run, and the patient sample spiked with a weak positive control to detect PCR inhibitory substances (inhibition control).\n97\n Except for these external controls, internal controls, including plasmid DNA, virus\u2010like particles (VLPs), RNase P gene, and housekeeping genes of airway epithelial cells such as beta\u2010actin have been used for NAT of respiratory viruses including SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Of all these kinds of internal controls, only RNase P presents in all types of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected samples and can control the quality of all procedures, from sample collection to amplification (Table 5). Thus, we recommend RNase P as internal control when amplifying SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA.",

Once virus has been isolated from patients, cell lysate or supernatant of virus infected cells could be used for serological assays. These methods are most convenient and rapid, as they only need susceptible cell cultures and virus. However, they need to be performed in BSL\u20103, and proper inactivation of the virus without reducing immunogenicity of antigens is required, thus limiting the widespread use of virus\u2010based serological testing. Furthermore, cross reaction is likely to happen because of the conserved sequence and structure between CoVs. By cloning immunogenic viral genes into prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression plasmids, transfecting the plasmids into bacterial or mammalian cells and purifying proteins, recombinant antigens can be developed to overcome the disadvantages of virus infected cells.\n99\n Recombinant antigens are safe and do not require BSL\u20103 containment. Importantly, although taking longer time and more steps for development, recombinant antigen based assays enable the selection of immunogenic and virus specific antigens to maximize both specificity and sensitivity, and more suitable for standardization.\n100\n In SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, N and S protein are the major immunogenic proteins and the first choice for producing recombinant antigens. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N, and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent\u2010phase SARS patients. Among them, anti\u2010S and anti\u2010N were dominant and could persist in the sera of SARS patients until week 30, while only anti\u2010S3 showed significant neutralizing activity.\n101\n Anti\u2010N appeared earlier than anti\u2010S, indicating that S protein\u2010based assays may be preferable for use with convalescent sera.102, 103 Sera tend to react against both antigens with higher sensitivity.\n102\n Cross reaction also happened in assays using recombinant antigens. Moderate cross\u2010reactivity between SARS\u2010CoV and porcine CoVs was mediated through amino acids 120 to 208 of the N protein.\n104\n Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant B\u2010cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat\u20102 region of S protein of SARS\u2010CoV and HCoV\u2010EMC,\n105\n which is known to harbor an epitope for broadly neutralizing antibody in the case of SARS\u2010CoV.\n106\n As a result, convalescent SARS sera cross reacted with HCoV\u2010EMC.\n105\n Thus, for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, specific recombinant antigens are required. Also, testing antibodies with different assays targeting different regions of antigens could avoid false\u2010positive results produced by cross reaction.",

The very important and first key to respond to outbreaks is early discovery.

The results of laboratory testing are affected by various factors. To improve NAT capacity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA, we summarized the literature and guidelines and suggested that: (a) If LRT specimens are unavailable, collect stool and blood samples at later period of illness to improve the positive rate of NAT. (b) Increase template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection. (c) Put samples in reagents containing guanidine salt such as TRIZOL, TRIZOL LS, or AVL buffer to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA.
