Funded by national and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private foundations, and even popular entertainers, large-scale new efforts are under way to address global killers like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others. This \"marvelous momentum\" can be seen as part of a continuing effort from the time of Jenner onward. Extrapolating from this, we explore the notion of a \"comprehensive global effort for the eradication, elimination or control of infectious disease,\" with particular attention to the ethical issues that arise. This is to \"think big\" about disease-control efforts that are now often done in piecemeal ways. This chapter identifies five tracks along which such efforts need to be pursued: (1) national and international organizations and the development of collective will; (2) epidemiological and health care infrastructure; (3) scientific development; (4) religious, social, and cultural considerations; (5) legal and social protections for individuals and groups. Each of these poses significant ethical issues which, we argue, should be viewed in a comprehensive way, to ensure that practice, research, and policy in each of these areas understands the person with communicable infectious disease as both victim and (potential) vector.",

Funded by national and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations, private foundations, and even popular entertainers, large-scale new efforts are under way to address global killers like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others. Legal standoffs over patent rights to antiretrovirals and other drugs have to some extent been resolved, and pressure is being exerted for the improvement of infrastructure issues, like clean water and improved sanitation. Research in the identification of pathogens, as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases, has made very great progress in some areas, especially in vaccine development and the development of rapid tests, in pandemic forecasting, and in the establishment of globally coordinated disease outbreak surveillance networks. At last, attention is being focused on orphan infectious diseases and the so-called neglected tropical diseases. It is, we think, a moment of growing optimism. Finally, after what has seemed like a long hiatus-roughly since the late 1960s and early 1970s when the then surgeon general was apparently saying that it was time to \"close the book on infectious disease,\" and concern over infectious disease was slipping out of public view, at least in the developed world-broad and publicly visible efforts at control are now again being made as a central part of the new concern for global health. Progress, it seems, is in the air.",

In 1999, the Gates Foundation announced that it would contribute $25 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) to further the development of an AIDS vaccine, and the following year dedicated $90 million towards control of HIV/AIDS in Africa, especially to decrease the rates of new infections and maternal-child transmission, and provide resources and training in palliative care to children orphaned by AIDS (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 2008) . The impressive size of the Gates' contributions, together with the fact that they came from a private entity rather than a governmental organization, contributed to a new optimism that at last something could be done to try to bring under control one of the world's most devastating pandemics, one that echoes the plagues of the middle ages and the 1918 influenza.",

The wealthy nations, especially the United States, had been attentive to issues of HIV treatment in their own populations and patent protections for their own pharmaceutical industries, but were seemingly oblivious to the skyrocketing death rate in the developing world and the devastation of an entire continent. HIV control on a global scale seemed impossible. However, galvanized perhaps by the infusion of both optimism and cash from the Gates Foundation, within the past decade governments, NGOs, public/private partnerships, multinational corporations, religious groups, and entertainers have rushed to contribute to a far more concerted effort to reduce the global burden of AIDS and with it other infectious diseases as well.",

With the emergence of HIV/AIDS on a global scale, the public awakened as well. The World Health Organization (WHO) had been making tireless efforts over the years, culminating in the ambitious 3 by 5 program to have three million HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy by 2005. Other foundations as well as Gates had been concerned with global health, like the Rockefeller Foundation; so were many national and international governmental institutions. Evolving market forces and improved education also played some role. But the Gates Foundation's immense contribution of private funding to fight AIDS has served as a catalyst, giving focus to many other efforts, both those initiated beforehand and especially those introduced afterwards. Governments of affluent countries have become major donors to efforts to improve global health: the United States, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Norway, Denmark, and Russia, ranked by size of contribution to the Global Fund as of early 2008, but less affluent countries have also been donors: Romania, Brazil, Mexico, Slovenia, Poland, and Hungary (The Global Fund, 2008) . Funds have poured in from multiple sources-a total of some $35 billion, by one estimate, as of January 2006 (Cohen 2006, 162-167) . Laurie Garrett, seconded by Paul Farmer, calls this \"a marvelous momentum\" (Garrett 2007) (Farmer and Garrett 2007) towards assistance in global health.",

Competition between entities, international tensions, commercial agendas, and very different styles of research funding and priority-setting make the picture far from seamlessly smooth. Political agendas sometimes undercut research; research sometimes violates local custom or understandings of fairness; popular misunderstandings sometimes block immunization drives and other efforts to control the transmission of disease. Officials at one organization complain of dominance by another (McNeil 2008) . There have been disappointments and failures: the 3 by 5 program for AIDS and Roll Back Malaria, for example, did not meet their ambitious initial goals. Only one million rather than three million people were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS in developing countries by June 2005 (WHO/UNAIDS 2005). Roll Back Malaria's clear pledge in 1998 to cut deaths from malaria in half by 2010 was labeled a failure, its principal contributors admitting that it was \"acting against a background of increasing malaria burden\"-that is, that malaria deaths were going up, not down.

            "text": "Furthermore, attention to infectious disease has been patchwork in character, focusing on some high-profile diseases while ignoring others that cost far more lives. While AIDS, Ebola, and avian flu fuel widespread fear, some ongoing endemic killers, such as infantile diarrhea and childhood acute respiratory tract infections, receive little press and correspondingly little funding or policy attention. Indeed, Solomon Benatar laments the \"siloed\" character of approaches to infectious disease (Benatar 2005) , one disease at a time. Laurie Garrett despairs of \"stovepipe\" funding: aid that is piped down narrow channels relating to a particular program or disease, ignoring broader needs and concerns: she cites as an example the case in which a government receives considerable support for an antiretroviral distribution program for mothers and children in a specific area, but nothing else. The consequence: mothers who are HIV+ receive drugs for their own infection and to prevent maternal/infant transmission at delivery, but they cannot obtain obstetric and gynecological care or infant immunizations (Garrett 2007, 22-23) . Attention to specific diseases has seemed to be quite unequal: while massive research efforts have been directed towards development of a vaccine against HIV, with more than 30 candidates currently in the pipeline, no new tuberculosis vaccine has been developed since 1921, even though the TB bacillus is a technically easier target than the human immunodeficiency virus. In most developing countries the method of diagnosing TB is still the same as that used in 1847.",

The many programs of research in vaccines and antimicrobials, the various water purification and public sanitation projects, the various initiatives for the control of diseases from AIDS to human papillomavirus (HPV)-caused cervical cancer to river blindness, and the multiple legal and social programs like model statutes and pandemic prioritization policies contribute to these emerging, newly coalescing global efforts towards the ultimate goal of control of infectious disease, the details of which are being continuously filled in and modified as the various individual projects are developed and become more fully integrated.

This thought experiment considered the possibility that rapid testing (and treatment) were available for all the major infectious diseases-and asked whether it would be permissible to require such testing of everyone before they boarded an airplane. The inconvenience would be limited-just a cheek swab, a short delay (perhaps 20 minutes, perhaps as short as 120 seconds), and of course a longer delay with treatment if necessary-but the possibility of reducing the global burden of infectious disease would be immense (Battin et al. 2008, chapter 15) . In another sense, it is a projection of the overall direction we discern in the many somewhat disparate enterprises already under way, a description of an overall project on which many organizations around the globe have already embarked. And in yet another sense, casting a Global Effort as highly timefocused, pursued within the specific decade 2020-2030, looks very much like a plan, something we are already embarked upon and should continue pursuing.",

It lies somewhere between a sheer thoughtexperiment (\"What if the serious human infectious diseases could be brought under control?\"); a factual account of events that are now taking place (\"Look at all the remarkable progress that is going on!\"); and a practical proposal with a concrete, dated plan (\"What would it take to bring the serious human infectious diseases under control, and to do so-this is the visionary part-by the end of the decade 2020-2030?\"). The power of a thought experiment is to help identify moral fault lines (as in our airport thought experiment), and the importance of a factual account of what is actually going on is to remind ourselves of the very substantial progress, as well as backsliding, that has been made so far. And the heuristic device of a time-pressured feature, of imagining the culmination of this Effort in a fastapproaching, specific, and limited period of time-the decade 2020-2030-emphasizes the real-world challenges of global coordination and cooperation, if that is what would be necessary to bring the serious human communicable diseases under control. But most important for our concerns here, this chapter's broader and far more realistic exploration of what is afoot in the new \"marvelous momentum\" of efforts to reduce the global burden of disease also involves exploring concrete moral claims about what would be required to make this immense global effort go ethically well.",

To think about an emerging, overall, coordinated globe-wide project is to \"think big\" about all the factors across the board that affect how we might address a challenge to human well-being that had almost disappeared from ethical dialogue in the late 1960s and early 1970s, before renewed ethical debate with the emergence of HIV, even though advances like the development of new antimicrobials and the eradication of smallpox were proceeding apace. It is such an ongoing project that has now come into view again with real force, reenergized and far more publicly visible in the last seven or eight years, and that makes it imperative to \"think big.\"",

The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG), for example, represent an effort to think globally about health and related problems (United Nations 2008). The Gates Foundation's Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative is also global in scale: it seeks to achieve scientific breakthroughs against diseases that disproportionately affect the two billion poorest people on earth, though of course diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis can affect people everywhere. The Council of Science Editors has organized a global theme issue on poverty and human development involving more than 230 science and biomedical journals, focusing among other things on interventions to improve health among the poor (Flanagin and Winker 2007) . These are all invaluable efforts involving the many, many parts of the overall picture, and they all \"think big.\" At the same time that practical efforts are converging in the effort to control infectious disease, there is an efflorescence of efforts to consider the ethical issues involved. With the exception of those directed to HIV/AIDS, most date from 1999 or later, and recent attention to the ethics issues in pandemic influenza planning has been particularly extensive. Documents like that from WHO by Coleman, Reis, and Croisier (Coleman et al. 2007 ) articulate policies; others, like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) document authored by Annas, Mariner, and Parmet (Annas et al. 2008) , vigorously critique policies already developed on the basis of ethical inadequacies. And a major effort has been mounted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to look specifically at the ethical issues in the emerging concern with global health: this is the ethical, social, and cultural program that is funded under the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative, designed to use bioethics considerations to assess the specific Grand Challenges projects that are planned or are currently under way (Singer et al. 2008 ). Elsewhere we document how infectious disease had been left out of bioethics during that new field's formative years (Battin et al. 2008, chapter 4 ); now it is moving back in, so to speak, with extraordinary rapidity, making up for a couple of decades of lost time.",

Up through the middle of the 19th century, everywhere in the world, parasitic and infectious diseases were the principal cause of human mortality (Olshansky and Ault 1987, 207-217) . With the development of clean water, public sanitation, immunization, the germ theory of disease, hand washing by physicians, antibiotics, and many other factors, infectious disease (with the single exception of pneumonia) is not even on the standard list of the top ten causes of death in the developed world. At the same time, infectious diseases remain a major factor in the developing world, where death rates particularly for children remain high. Just a century or two ago, infectious and parasitic diseases were the way most people everywhere in the world died; in the developed world, they are a much reduced threat, and where they do kill, kill mainly the old. Infectious disease mortality in the United States has declined remarkably in the past century, and now represents a small percentage (<5%) of disability-adjusted life-years lost (Armstrong et al. 1999 ). The stark differences in life expectancy around the world, ranging roughly from a high of between 75 and 86 years for both sexes in Japan, Australia, Iceland, Canada, the Netherlands, Cuba, and the United Kingdom at the top end of the range, downward to 40-60 years in the poorer, developing nations, and in some countries, like Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, still lower, to Sierra Leone, with a low of 37-40 years, is not just a matter of disparate human development indices but differential death rates from infectious disease (World Health Organization, data for 2005). A Comprehensive Global Effort, it is painfully obvious, has already been very largely successful in the developed world-this may be part of what has allowed the developed world to become developed-but has a long, long way to go in those countries left behind.",

The eradication of all human infectious disease-that is, completely ridding the world of all disease-causing pathogens in the wild-is not a realistic goal, since many human-affecting infectious diseases also have nonhuman vectors or reservoirs. Tetanus, for example, lives in the soil; so do the spores of coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection responsible for valley fever (McKinley 2008) . Malaria involves a transmission stage in mosquitoes; so do yellow fever, dengue fever, and many other arthropod-borne infectious diseases. Other common infections-such as staphylococcal skin infections, or peritonitis due to ruptured bowel-are due to organisms that we normally carry on our skin or in our gastrointestinal tracts, and attempts to eliminate one pathogen would be foiled by the rapid appearance of other potential pathogens to refill the microbial niche in the skin or gastrointestinal (GI) tract.",

Elimination of these organisms in humans, for instance by means of universal immunization or effective treatment, would still not eliminate these organisms, and the diseases they cause will remain a continuing threat. Some human-affecting diseases also affect animals and are carried by animals-Rift Valley fever, for example-and unless contact between these animals and humans were completely interrupted, control of these diseases in humans could not be complete without achieving control in the animal population as well. Some pathogens affect both people and plants, like the bacterium Burkholderia cepacia (people and onions), which can be lethal for people with cystic fibrosis, or Serratia marcescens (people and squash plants), which reaches immunocompromised hospital patients through floral arrangements, salads, and intravenous tubes (Milius 2007, 251) ; it is hard to see how these pathogens could be entirely eradicated. And some infectious diseases, such as influenza and HIV, reappear in modified form and potentially require ongoing prevention or treatment in generation after generation. At this point in the human history of infectious disease, there is just one extant example of complete eradication: smallpox. But there are many examples of elimination, that is, reduction to a very low level, like leprosy, plague, and polio, the latter on the verge of eradication despite recent outbreaks. And there are many examples of full or nearly full control, at least in the developed world, where disease is preventable, treatable, or curable by means of immunization, antimicrobials, sanitation measures (e.g., clean water), or other effective prevention or treatment.",

This is to seek to establish and maintain the collective, global will to try to reduce the global burden of infectious disease as low a level as possible. The practical challenge is to develop the global political will to try to work together to bring infectious disease under control in the first place, and it is a substantial challenge. If the many sorts of institutions are all to cooperate, it would require laying aside infighting, reducing political competition, avoiding distraction by shifting from one to another \"short-term numerical target\" (Farmer and Garrett 2007) , avoiding turf wars, and other things that could derail progress (Cohen 2006, 162-167) . Could all these institutions contribute cooperatively in their myriad ways to a common project, even for just a decade?

The absence of adequate health care infrastructure, including the absence of adequate diagnostic and surveillance measures as well as adequate immunization and treatment measures, can contribute dramatically to the unchecked spread of infectious disease. An outbreak unnoticed (or ignored) can have an immense amplification effect down the road; the \"stitch in time\" approach to infectious disease is key to prevention, in that it is almost always easier to stop one case now than ten cases down the road-or a hundred, or a hundred thousand. Poverty and war have crucial amplifying effects: diseases that might be mild or resisted altogether by individuals who are healthy and well nourished may spread rapidly in disrupted conditions where people endure malnourishment, parasites, and chronic illness. Natural disasters can also produce similar effects, if populations are cut off from care, and if the conditions of the disaster-standing water after a flood, for instance-create risks of disease. Economic practices can also affect disease transmission: for example, the practice common in many developing countries that physicians see private patients rather than poor, charity ones, exacerbates disease transmission, since it is poor, charity patients who are most likely to be afflicted because of their crowded living conditions and lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation. Poverty, war, and natural disaster are also typically associated with inadequate infrastructure: for those who do become ill, health care is hardly available; clinics, if there are any, are overcrowded; personnel are inadequately trained and hopelessly stressed; medications are outmoded or unavailable. Poverty and war are often closely intertwined: northeast Kenya, for example, has a million refugees from Somalia, people for whom the risks of infectious disease are compounded over the already difficult lives they had previously led. Another 300,000 have been internally displaced following the postelection violence in early 2008, and the chief among the many health risks they face is cholera (Harvard World Health News 2008) . Life in refugee camps or urban slums, often without adequate sanitation facilities, is, as our PVV view might describe it, life most fully \"enmeshed in the web of disease,\" life in which people are most obviously \"way-station selves\" as microorganisms travel unchecked among them. Thus, in seeking greater control of infectious disease, attention to social and sanitary infrastructure issues is crucial:",

What will be the impact of a Global Effort on all parties? Some concerns might involve those whose current income depends on treatment of infectious disease. After all, if a Global Effort were to succeed and the global burden of infectious disease dramatically reduced, this income would be eliminated. Who will be out of a job? Larger economic concerns might focus for instance on the impact of higher rates of infant and child survival on domestic and social situations where poverty is severe, or on changed patterns of survival-reflecting the success of a Global Effort in reducing death rates-on economies around the world. There would presumably be relatively little effect on economies in the advanced industrial nations where infectious disease is already largely under control, but there could be dramatic effect in the worst-off nations of the world. Like everything else associated with it, a Comprehensive Global Effort should be subjected to adequate scrutiny in the decades prior to and during the culminating phase itself, with of course an eye to mitigating economic damage where it threatens to occur and but reaping the economic benefits of effective disease control as well.",

A Comprehensive Global Effort for the Control of Infectious Disease, incompletely developed as it is, is already well under way, whether we see it as a thought experiment, a description of current events, or a plan. Whichever way we interpret it, it requires us to consider the importance of not only global coordination and cooperation, but also the importance of coordinated, across-theboard ethical reflection. This ranges from reflection on comparatively focused issues like how to balance considerations of confidentiality versus public interest, how to weigh the impact of mandated treatment, or how to prioritize access to prevention and care in epidemics, to the deeper but at the moment more diffuse sorts of philosophical issues, such as whether attempts to control infectious disease should be given priority over attempts to control cancer or whether bioweaponry is intrinsically worse than conventional arms. In part because attention to the full control of infectious disease on a global scale has not so far been unified, the ethical issues each distinct effort raises have not been unified either, and have to a considerable extent been treated in comparatively isolated, discrete, \"siloed\" ways, even now that they are finally coming to be discussed at all in bioethics and other fields. This is not to say that ethical issues are to be viewed in a monolithic way, but rather that reflection on them must include understanding them in the larger context of a world in which we are \"all in this together,\" all potentially victims and vectors of transmissible infectious disease.",

But part of the point of a thought experiment like that is to test the ethical challenges to be faced in the real world, not just in a fictional one, and hence the challenges that would and do arise in what we see as an already-emerging Comprehensive Global Effort. Ethical reflection in the context of infectious disease, we have been arguing all along, must be far broader than it has been, even during the efflorescence of the last seven or eight years-that is why we appeal not only to a limited thought-experiment about airport surveillance but to the much broader constellation of developments we have called an emerging Comprehensive Global Effort for the Control of Infectious Disease.",

These are all recognized as devastating. AIDS has already killed 19 million people and, as of 2007, another 33.2 million are infected with the HIV virus. Tuberculosis infects or has infected an estimated 30% of the global population and kills about 2 million people a year. Worldwide, malaria infects between 350 and 500 million people every year, and between 2 to 3 million die from it-90% in Africa, where it is estimated that one child dies from malaria every 30 seconds (Packard 2007, xvi) . The new movement for global health, building on the steady work of the WHO and others over many years and galvanized less than a decade ago by the remarkable private contribution of the Gates Foundation, is already committed to the elimination of these diseases; it has become a top global priority. Yet-here is the key to our project in this \"think big\" essay-eliminating any one of these diseases will raise virtually all the issues we have posed in the five tracks outlined above. So would eliminating all three. Indeed, for any disease or group of diseases for which we might consider trying to achieve global or even local eradication, elimination, or control, issues about institutional cooperation, infrastructure improvement, scientific development, religious and cultural attitudes, and social and legal protections are all relevant. Comprehensive ethical reflection is crucial in such an enterprise as well: while it is important to be sensitive to the specific, factual features of any given case, we cannot do ethics piecemeal, as an iterated effort one disease after another for the indefinite future, or in response to one new technology, or one political challenge, or one scientific development at a time, without a larger picture of human embeddedness in webs of mutual disease transmission, within which they occur.",

We can imagine, as we have said, other Global Efforts directed towards other global problems-climate change and global warming, endangered species rescue, water justice, immigration management, global drug control, and so on. But the vision of a Comprehensive Global Effort for the Years 2020-2030 for the Eradication, Elimination, or Control of Infectious Disease may be, in contrast, simpler: its overall purpose of reducing the burden of infectious disease may be less controversial; its methods are not technically impossible; its science is reasonably well understood; and it does not require the change of institutions, only coordination and cooperation. Imagining such a project is of course to \"think big,\" but we can certainly imagine what this project would take, as the culmination of the efforts of several centuries, to achieve within a single decade a goal with which the fate of humankind might be dramatically improved. There is no way to guarantee that it would succeed. But it is a project already well under way, since the time of Jenner and with the best efforts of dedicated researchers, clinicians, and workers in public health. There is no practical or moral reason not to undertake this project, though plenty of reason to be cautious about how to do so-that is what we have tried to explore.",

A Global Effort, or even just continuing ordinary efforts to control infectious disease, might contain repressive, biased, insensitive, or otherwise morally indefensible elements, particularly if it were pursued under a tight time schedule by zealous institutions or highly competitive players. That there is a current efflorescence of ethical reflection does not entail that the various components of the overall global effort will go ethically well, and ethical reflection by itself will not prevent abuse. It is important to understand how even an admirable project with a highly desirable goal-extricating humankind from the web of infectious disease-could go wrong, that is, how it could be done, but not done well. It remains to look at a variety of policies of the sort that might be involved in a Global Effort to see what can go wrong with them as well as right, using our PVV view as a tool for examining actual, real-world policies as a way of thinking about larger aims.",
