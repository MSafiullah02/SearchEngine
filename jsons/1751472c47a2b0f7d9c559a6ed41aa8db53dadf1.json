They attach and replicate in the susceptible and permissive hosts and host derived cell lines. They enter the cells either through direct attachment, receptor-mediated endocytosis, or phagocytosis. Hence, to thwart the invasion by viruses, hosts have developed immunity in ascending stages-intrinsic, innate and adaptive immunity. A robust intrinsic and innate immune response governs an effective adaptive immune response, should that be needed. Both enveloped as well as nonenveloped viruses are subject to distinct types of DNA sensors, subject to their site of replication. DNA sensors of viral PAMPs can be classified into three types, based on the location of their PAMPs in the host cellular compartment viz. cell surface, cytoplasmic and nuclear. The host cell membrane both, surface as well as intra cellular, is continuously monitored for the non-host, pathogenic components or PAMPs. Among the intracellular sensors of the viral genome, there are two types-essentially due to the two types of major viral genomes i.e. RNA and DNA sensors. The cytosolic DNA sensors include AIM2, IFI16, cGAS, RNA Pol III, DNA-PK, DDX9, DHX36, DDX41, DDX60, DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1 and MRE11. PYHIN family of sensors include AIM2, IFI16, IFIX and MNDA. Another recently discovered family of sensor called stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), specifically houses on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions in association with its upstream sensor, cGAS. Some DNA sensors shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus pre-and post-extraneous DNA binding. These include IFI16, IFIX, RNA Pol III, etc. There is no exclusive nuclear DNA sensor. Many enzymes known to be present in the cells for their 16 244 obvious primary functions also additionally function as DNA sensors. The DNAse family of sensors include DNAse II and TREX1, which are ubiquitously present in the cell for their housekeeping functions. The RNAse family of sensor includes one member-RNA Pol III. Additionally, DNA-PK also functions to cater to viral DNA sensing. The endosomal DNA sensors include TLR7 and TLR9, which belong to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. The DExD/H-box helicase family include the putative DNA sensors recently discovered including DDX9, DHX36, DDX41 and DDX60. Several other sensors remain to be characterised or are less classified viz. DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1, MRE11. In general, response to a viral RNA or DNA produces three types of responses, namely, production of antiviral cytokines including Types I and III IFNs, release of pro-inflammatory and inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors.

There are about 18-26 copies of LRRs which vary in different TLRs.

TLR-1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are expressed on the surface of the membrane, whereas TLR-3, 7, 8 and 9 are expressed inside the endosomal membrane. TLR-4 utilises accessory proteins MD2, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14. Amongst all, TLR-9 recognises unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. In the human genome, the DNA methyltransferases heavily methylate cytosine residues. However, in the genome of bacteria and many viruses, CpG dinucleotides remain unmethylated and thus serve as PAMP. Delivery of TLR-9 (and TLR-3, 7, 8) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endosome relies on UNC-93B, a protein composed of 12 transmembrane domains.

This brings about the cytoplasmic tails to come in proximity. TIR domain containing adaptor proteins are now recruited, which bind the TIR domains in the cytoplasmic tails.

Nuclear factor \u03ba-B (NF-\u03baB), activation protein-1 (AP-1), interferon response factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 are the major transcription factors which are activated by TLR signalling pathways. NF-\u03baB and AP-1 are responsible for the expression of genes encoding inflammatory response molecules, including (but not limited to) inflammatory cytokines, endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines. IRF3 and IRF7 stimulate the production type I interferons (IFNs), which are central to antiviral innate immune responses. Different TLRs use different combination of adaptors and signalling intermediates and thus mediate unique downstream effects. TLR9 uses the MyD88-dependent, TRIF-independent pathway and activates both NF-\u03baB and IRFs. Hence, they induce both inflammatory and antiviral responses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanism of Action"}, {"text": "Two protein domains of MyD88 allow it to function as an adaptor protein: a TIR domain at its carboxy terminus that associates with the TIR domains of the TLR cytoplasmic tails and a death domain at its amino terminus, which associates with the death domains present in other intracellular signalling proteins. It is worthwhile to note that both the domains of MyD88 are essential for signalling. The MyD88 death domain recruits and activates IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK4) and IRAK1, which are both serine-threonine protein kinases. The complex involving IRAK, TIR of cytoplasmic tails and MyD88 executes two functions-executing the enzymes that produce a signalling scaffold, employing the scaffold to recruit other molecules which are then phosphorylated by the IRAKs. The formation of signalling scaffold is a multi-step process: The IRAK complex brings in the enzyme tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in association with TRIKA1 (composed of UBC13, which is an E2 ubiquitin ligase with a cofactor for Uve1A). TRAF6 and UBC13 together have the function of polyubiquitination. This polyubiquitin has linkages between lysine63 of pervious subunit and C terminus of the next, leading to K63 linkages. The same process can be initiated on vivid proteins, including TRAF6 or the multi-ubiquitin chains can exist independently as free linear chains which can be extended to form polyubiquitin chains, which can bind to other signalling proteins. Further, the scaffold brings in signalling complex that is made up of TAB1, TAB2-ubiquitin binding adaptor molecules, and TAK1-a serine-threonine kinase. IRAK complex phosphorylates TAK1, which propagates signalling by activation of certain MAPKs like c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) and MAPK14 (p38 MAPK). This brings about downstream activation of AP-1 family of transcription factors which transcribe cytokine genes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanism of Action"}, {"text": "TAK1 additionally phosphorylates and activates the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex. IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3 constitute the IKK complex (the IKK\u03b3 is also known as NF-\u039ab essential modifier or NEMO). NEMO binds to polyubiquitin chains, which leads to IKK complex close to TAK1. TAK1 then activates IKK\u03b2 by its phosphorylation. IKK\u03b2 then phosphorylates inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB), which is a cytoplasmic protein that natively binds to the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. I\u03baB is made up of two subunits-p50 and p65. The binding of I\u03baB prevents the movement of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus from cytoplasm. Post phosphorylation of IKK, the I\u03baB is released from the functional subunit of NF-\u03baB, which leads to translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus, where it leads to transcription of genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6.

For TLR9 signalling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, MyD88 exclusively is used as an adaptor protein. The TIR domain of MyD88 employs IRAK1/IRAK4 complex as described earlier. However, the IRAK complex carries out a different function beyond recruiting TRAFs which generates a signalling scaffold. In these cells, IRAK1 can also interact with IRF7, which is highly expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

It is usually located in the cytosol and is key to responses in vitro to vaccinia virus (Janeway). However, it ubiquitously oligomerises upon stimulation. The downstream aggregates so formed recruit and activate a protease-caspase-1 that leads to the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 which ultimately culminates into a programmed cell death, termed 'pyroptosis' (Bergsbaken et al. 2009; Miao et al. 2011 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 322, "text": "(Schattgen and Fitzgerald 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 742, "end": 766, "text": "(Bergsbaken et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 767, "end": 783, "text": "Miao et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AIM2"}, {"text": "Interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) was recently characterised as the first viral DNA sensor to function within the nucleus. It is a member of PYHIN protein family (Diner et al. 2015a; Schattgen and Fitzgerald 2011) . IFI16 has two HIN domains. At its C terminus, it has two HIN200 domains which bind to DNA. At its N-terminal, is a pyrin (PY) domain which mediates homotypic interactions within the molecules as well as cooperative assembly of small subunits of IFI16 (Li et al. 2013; Morrone et al. 2014 ). This binding is sequence-independent manner (Jin et al. 2012) . It primarily functions in the nucleus, where it is located. It recognises viral dsDNA. The function of IFI16 depends on the type of cell in which it functions. In the immune cells, IFI16 binds to cytosolic viral DNA, engaging sting and induces IFN production (Unterholzner et al. 2010; Horan et al. 2013; Jakobsen et al. 2013 ). However, in non-immune cells, IFI16 majorly functions in the nucleus by localising there (Diner et al. 2015a; Li et al. 2013 Li et al. , 2012 Orzalli et al. 2012) . A plausible explanation for this is that the there exists a multi-partite nuclear localisation signal on IFI16 and is necessary for its transit between nucleus and cytoplasm (Li et al. 2012) . Especially in case of herpesvirus infections, both IFI16 and STING are required for inducing the expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (Orzalli et al. 2012 ). The differences in IFI16 DNA-sensing are possibly due to the cell type-dependent process (Diner et al. 2015b) . Prompt responses are required in case of immune cells, and thus, DNA-sensing components localised in the cytoplasm makes more sense, whereas, in non-immune cells, the IFI16 might play some housekeeping functions but additionally may respond to the successful viral infections in the nucleus. Additionally, IFI16 also mounts inflammatory and apoptotic responses to foreign DNA through inflammasome-a multiprotein assembly (Kerur et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Ansari et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2013; Monroe et al. 2014) . In reality, the evidence that IFI16 elicits both, type I IFN response as well as inflammation is contradictory, since type I IFNs are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory effect (Theofilopoulos et al. 2005; Billiau 2006; Guarda et al. 2011 ). Recently, IFI16 was shown to play a direct role in inhibiting the formation of both, AIM2 and NLR family inflammasomes (Veeranki et al. 2011) . Hence, it is quite possible that the role of IFI16 in inflammasome responses is cell type dependent and other yet unknown factors do play a role too. Recent evidences suggest that IFI16 and cGAS may function in harmony to execute immune signalling to nuclear foreign DNA (Orzalli et al. 2015) . This also suggests that IFI16 is a dominant nuclear DNA sensor, whereas cGAS has auxiliary functions like stabilising the IFI16 to enable or prolong signal efficiency.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 188, "text": "(Diner et al. 2015a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 189, "end": 219, "text": "Schattgen and Fitzgerald 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 473, "end": 489, "text": "(Li et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 490, "end": 509, "text": "Morrone et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 557, "end": 574, "text": "(Jin et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 836, "end": 862, "text": "(Unterholzner et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 863, "end": 881, "text": "Horan et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 882, "end": 902, "text": "Jakobsen et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1015, "text": "(Diner et al. 2015a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1030, "text": "Li et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1047, "text": "Li et al. , 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1068, "text": "Orzalli et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1261, "text": "(Li et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1424, "text": "(Orzalli et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1537, "text": "(Diner et al. 2015b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1980, "text": "(Kerur et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 2001, "text": "Johnson et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2021, "text": "Ansari et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2040, "text": "Singh et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2060, "text": "Monroe et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2267, "text": "(Theofilopoulos et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2281, "text": "Billiau 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2282, "end": 2300, "text": "Guarda et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2423, "end": 2445, "text": "(Veeranki et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2719, "end": 2740, "text": "(Orzalli et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IFI16"}, {"text": "Some of the PYHIN family members, namely, IFIX and MNDA also majorly localise in the nucleus.
