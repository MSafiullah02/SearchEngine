Santarpia et al5 detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 2 of 3 COVID-19 patient rooms >1.8 m (6 feet) from each patient and in 8 of 12 air samples in the hallway outside patient rooms. Some COVID-19 patients were receiving supplemental oxygen, but the report did not specify whether they were receiving aerosol-generating procedures (eg, nebulized medication) at the time of, or prior to, the assessment of viral RNA in air samples. Most importantly, utilizing 2 different methods, viable virus was not detected in air samples. A low concentration of viral RNA in air samples may have made viable viral detection difficult. These results suggest that finding viral RNA in the air without viable virus, at least at the lower level of detection utilized, is of uncertain clinical significance. In contradistinction to results from patient rooms, Van Dorenmalen et al6 created aerosols using a 3-jet collision nebulizer to aerosolize SARS-CoV-2 into the air at a concentration similar to that found in respiratory tract secretions and found the median estimated half-life of viable virus to be 1.1 hours (95% credible interval, 0.6\u20132.6 hours).",

However, the odds ratio increased from 1.06 for laboratory-confirmed infection to 1.31 for influenza-like illness and to 1.49 for clinically defined respiratory infection. These results suggest the possibility that N95 respirators may have a more protective effect. Again, none of these differences were statistically significant in the analysis of 5,549 healthcare workers. The analysis was not stratified by use of source control, such as a surgical mask, worn by patients when in close contact with healthcare workers. One of the studies10 in the meta-analysis found no significant difference in risk of human coronavirus infection between the 2 groups. In a retrospective study, Seto et al11 found that wearing a surgical mask or N95 respirator significantly reduced risk among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. Ng et al12 found that none of 35 healthcare workers who had worn a surgical mask when caring for COVID-19 patients became infected, including patients receiving aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation.",
