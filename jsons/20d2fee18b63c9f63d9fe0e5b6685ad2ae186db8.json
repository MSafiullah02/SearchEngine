            "text": "A fundamental understanding of how bacteria and viruses become airborne remains elusive yet is central to understanding their role in atmospheric processes and the spread of disease. Microbial transmission and survival are influenced by particle size, relative humidity, temperature, environmental composition, and virus type [1] [2] [3] , yet the mechanisms controlling their initial airborne transmission are poorly understood. The atmosphere contains vast bacterial (6 \u00d7 10 4 -1.6 \u00d7 10 7 cells m \u22123 ) and viral populations arising from a wide range of aquatic, terrestrial, and organismal biomes [4] [5] [6] [7] . As the ocean covers 71% of the planet and contains 60-90% of the world's prokaryotes by cell abundance in open ocean and sediment 8 , sea spray aerosol (SSA) represents a significant yet largely understudied source of airborne bacteria and viruses. Bacteria in aerosols can travel as far as 11,000 km, with air residence times of days to weeks 1, 5, 9 , and algal viruses maintain infectivity over several hundred kilometers 10 . Airborne bacteria and viruses influence climate by serving as cloud seeds and inducing ice nucleation [11] [12] [13] [14] . Microbes detected in clouds and precipitation have major impacts on ice formation and precipitation efficiency, yet their source remains largely unknown 15 . Airborne microbes also impact air quality through transmission of allergens and pathogens 16 . However, identification of species-level contributions of ocean microbes to atmospheric processes and air quality has never been definitely determined.",

Accordingly, an ocean-atmosphere facility, developed collaboratively by chemists, oceanographers, and marine biologists was employed to study microbial aerosolization in a controlled setting using locally derived seawater and breaking waves 32 .

We report SSA enhancement patterns correspond to related taxa and therefore, are determined at the genomic level, and that bacteria are generally more enriched in SSA than viruses. Changes to SSA enrichment as apparent responses to environmental cues or other signals are shared between related taxonomic classes and orders.

Filtered (50 \u00b5m) coastal Pacific seawater (32\u00b052\u2032 01.4\u2033 N 117\u00b015\u2032 26.5\u2033 W) was supplemented with nitrate, phosphate, and trace metals to induce phytoplankton growth under continuous illumination (45 \u00b5E m \u22122 s \u22121 ) with mixing provided by wave breaking or bubbling (Methods). Exogenous organic matter was not added. The conditions generated two phytoplankton blooms and corresponding heterotrophic bacterial blooms (Fig. 1a) . Growth was monitored using chlorophyll a fluorescence to track bulk phytoplankton abundance and cell and virus counts in bulk seawater, SSML, and SSA (Fig. 1a, Table 1 ). Bulk chlorophyll a levels, cell counts by flow cytometry, and viral counts by epifluorescence microscopy were representative of natural oceanic bloom timescales and concentrations 8, 33, 34 (Supplementary Note 1). Due to the proximity of the SSA collection ports to the breaking waves, the average aerosol bacterial concentrations (1.26 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 0.19 \u00d7 10 7 cells m \u22123 ) were 1000-fold higher than those estimated in natural environments where aerosols are sampled many meters above the sea surface and diluted by the atmosphere 9 . Aquatic bacterial abundance moderately increased with phytoplankton populations during the first phytoplankton bloom, while the peak for the second bacterial bloom was both larger in intensity and slightly delayed from the phytoplankton peak. The concentrations of bacterial cells in the bulk and SSML were positively correlated, while aerosol abundances were negatively correlated with seawater population. Bacteria were not immediately released into SSA from SSML, suggesting dynamics that depend on growth and accumulation in the bulk seawater and SSML prior to atmospheric release. In the ocean, virus-like particle concentrations are generally 5-25 times greater than bacteria 35 , and here we observed ten-fold greater bulk viral concentration by cell (Fig. 1a ) and particle counts (Table 1) . However, average SSA concentrations of viruses (1.19 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 0.58 \u00d7 10 7 cells m \u22123 ) and bacteria were nearly equivalent indicating preferential aerosolization of bacteria relative to viruses (Table 2) .",

Comparisons between the taxa in these compartments reveal key differences in community distributions (Fig. 1b, c) . Likely due to adaptation to the growth system and preference for species thriving in eutrophic conditions, the aquatic microbial population shifted significantly from the original oceanic composition, but after Day 8 remained relatively constant for the duration of the experiment with small shifts in individual taxa similar to bacterial community shifts observed during natural marine phytoplankton blooms 39, 42 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The blooms also contained taxa not often found in seawater including an avian strain of Escherichia coli and a novel strain of Legionella, as revealed by assembly of nearly complete genomes (Supplementary Table 4 , 5). The novel Legionella strain has 70-80% amino acid identity to orthologs in Legionella pneumophila (Legionnaires' disease) and Legionella drancourtii and has both Type II and Type IV secretion systems typical of pathogenic strains. E. coli and Legionella were present in initial samples ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), suggesting they were native to the coastal community but became enriched in our system during the experiment.

The relative enrichment occurring in the sea-to-air exchange process was determined by calculating the aerosolization factor (AF) for each genome in the 0.2-3 \u00b5m size fraction for bacteria and 0.025-0.2 \u00b5m for viruses. This is defined as the ratio of the fraction in SSA (A) to the fraction in bulk seawater (B) or the fraction in the SSML (S) (Eq. 1). Surface enrichment factors are calculated similarly using the ratio of S to B (S:B). indicate genomes that are primarily waterborne (A:B and A:S < 1). The upper-left quadrants indicate species enriched relative to bulk but not SSML (A:B > 1, A:S < 1), and the bottom-right indicates species enriched in aerosol relative to the SSML but not bulk (A:B < 1, A:S > 1). A Gaussian distribution of species, centered at (1,1), would be expected if aerosolization was random. However, the \"spindle\"-shaped distribution of the data reveals non-random patterns. The distribution is similar in the genome spatial coverage trimmed data set ( Supplementary Fig 3a, b) . Histograms and normality analysis revealed positively skewed data with a non-normal distribution and mean bacterial AF of 0.90 ( Supplementary Fig. 4a -c, Supplementary Table 7) . Genomes predominantly exhibit SSA enrichment or depression with respect to both bulk and SSML. While water-enriched species (AF values <1) represented 52% of the population, aerosol enrichment was much larger in amplitude than diminishment, reflected in a greater extension of data points into the red region compared to the blue region of Fig. 2a . The average maximum AF value is two times larger in amplitude than the average minimum value. A genetic signal in bacterial AF is evident at fine-scale taxonomic levels when individual genomes are compared (Fig. 3a , Supplementary Figs. [5] [6] [7] [8] . Closely related species have nearly identical aerosolization patterns that are propagated across environmental and enrichment changes. Genomes within the same class (Actinobacteria and Flavobacteriia) or order (Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales, and Alteromonadales) typically have similar aerosolization profiles. Examples of bacterial genomes with consistently high AF values include Rhodococcus erythropolis, Cutibacterium acnes, and Methylobacterium radiotolerans. Conversely, genomes such as Flavobacterium indicum, Cellulophaga lytica, and Erythobacter litoralis had persistently low AFs. The low AF values of the Erythobacter draft genome provide ancillary assembly based evidence for the read-based analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 7) .",

In read-based sequence analysis, the proportion of viral to bacterial reads in aerosol at the division level was consistently lower than bulk in all size fractions suggesting decreased viral transfer even when they are associated with larger particles such as bacteria or phytoplankton (Supplementary Table 8 ). Decreased viral transfer is further supported by comparisons of data distributions of viral and bacterial communities in read-based analyses (Supplementary Fig. 4a-f, Supplementary Table 7 ). Viral distributions were shifted more negatively and had lower mean AFs than bacterial populations (viral-0.72 \u00b1 4.70, bacterial-0.90 \u00b1 2.32).

The ability to rapidly desiccate and tolerate desiccation are important factors in viral pathogen transmission as they increase the time particles remain aloft and viable 50, 51 . Most respiratory viruses, like influenza and corona viruses, are lipid enveloped and able to survive longer at low relative humidity (15-40%); nonenveloped viruses require a minimum of 70% humidity for viability 1,3 . Similar trends are echoed in these data (Fig. 3b) . Tailed bacteriophage utilize surface capsid proteins that are likely hydrophilic, while herpesviruses are lipid enveloped [52] [53] [54] . Here, Caudovirales were generally waterborne while Herpesvirales were aerosol enriched. Hydrophobic surface features probably assist in rapid cell desiccation, which is one potential mechanism of aerosolization and surface enrichment.",

The results reveal the taxon-specific dynamics of viral and bacterial transfer across the air-sea interface during phytoplankton blooms, conditions that generate increased bacterial and viral water concentrations with increased potential impact to airborne environments. Aerosol enrichment is dictated by inherent biochemical properties and influenced by environmental conditions. Taxon-specific patterns are applied to reveal different aerosolization mechanisms and indicate trends of broad taxonomies applicable to a variety of systems. Taxa with enhanced aerosolization likely have a larger influence on climate properties, and studies with relevant isolates will clarify specific contributions to atmospheric processes. Several bacterial lineages of known respiratory and airborne pathogens are identified in this study, including Legionella, E. coli, Corynebacterium, and Mycobacterium. Factors that modulate SSA formation likely will apply to other aerosolization processes. Elucidating the specific aerosolization mechanisms of pathogens, either from environmental reservoirs or from hosts themselves, may form the basis of therapeutics that target aerosolization by interaction with surface features or inhibition of relevant biosynthetic pathways. These findings provide a framework to resolve such mechanisms.",

Water was filtered using 50 \u03bcM Nitex mesh to remove grazing zooplankton before transfer into the wave channel tank. The wavechannel is a 33 m \u00d7 0.5 m \u00d7 1 m (0.6 m water depth), enclosed (supplied HEPA-filtered air), glass, growth system equipped with a hydraulic pump attached to a vertical paddle at one end. Each pulse created one simulated wave that broke midway through the channel just upstream of sampling ports and is calibrated to mimic aerosol formation that occurs during natural wave breaking 32 . Aerosol sampling ports were positioned~3 ft downfield of the general position of the breaking waves. Bloom conditions were initiated by the addition of F/2 medium (Proline, Aquatic Eco-Systems, Apopka, FL) supplemented separately with sodium metasilicate. F/2 is a common marine medium for algae cultivation that provides 880 \u00b5M NaNO 3 , 36 \u00b5M NaH 2 PO 4 \u00b7H 2 O, 70 \u00b5M Na 2 SiO 3 \u00b79H 2 O along with trace metals 58 . An additional 9 \u00b5M sodium phosphate was added to the wave flume on July 25, 2014 as phosphate was depleted in the system. No exogenous carbon or additional nutritional supplementation was given for bacterial cultivation. The tank was continuously illuminated (45 \u00b5E m \u22122 s \u22121 ).

The inlet was plumbed directly to the outlet of the wave flume. Aerosols for DNA analysis were concentrated into 7.5-10 mL of sterile PBS (pH 7.4) over 3 h of wave breaking.

Spatial coverage analysis was performed to determine the percent of the genome that is represented in a reference genome. Spatial coverage for each genome was calculated by implementing the following pipeline: (1) parsing Kraken label output files to generate individual fastq files for each taxonomy hit; (2) mapping the reads to their respective genome assembly (e.g., full chromosomes, contigs, plasmids, etc.) [HISAT2 v2.0.0] 65 ; (3) converting the *.sam files to *.bedgraph files [bedtools v2. 24 .0] 66 ; and (4) concatenating all sequences in the genome assembly and calculating the proportion of positions that were mapped. Eighty-five percent nucleotide identity is the mapping criteria.

Surface enrichment factors (S:B) predominately indicated SSML enrichment or neutral accumulation from bulk water(Supplementary Figs. 5, 7-9), and the magnitude of the S:B and AF values were positively correlated. ob act er ga llae cie nsi s Pa ra co cc us de nit rifi ca ns Di no ro se ob ac te r sh ib ae R ue ge ria po m er oy i K e to g u lo n ic ig e n iu m vu lg",

In b, the outer ring denotes viral family and shading indicates presence or lack of a viral envelope. i, ii, and iii indicate genomes with aerosolization patterns that differ from their closest relatives. Trees generated using phyloT (http://phylot.biobyte.de/) and iTOL (http://itol.embl.de/) The constitutive, low AF Flavobacteriia were the least surface enriched with an average S:B of 0.95 compared to 1.92 for all species examined (Supplementary Fig. 5). Constitutively high AF Actinobacteria had a corresponding above average S:B of 3.92. Viruses were more surface enriched than bacteria with an average S:B of 4.70 with a large contribution from global viral surface enrichment on Days 28 and 34 (Supplementary",
