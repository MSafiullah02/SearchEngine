As the largest enveloped RNA viruses with single plus-stranded RNA genomes of 26 to 32 kb, CoV are classified into four genera from Alpha-to Deltacoronavirus. The genus Betacoronavirus had four subgroups from 2a to 2d, including SARSr CoV from human, civet cats, raccoon dogs and bats belonging to subgroup 2b and MERS CoV belonging to subgroup 2c (Agnihothram et al., 2014) . Both Alpha-and Betacoronavirus have been found in the countries around Taiwan, including China, Philippines, Thailand and Japan. The most common bat species carrying bat CoV are Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus and Miniopterus bats (Tang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2010; Gouilh et al., 2011; Shirato et al., 2012) , which distribute widely in Asia, including Taiwan. They could carry and transmit bat CoV into local bat population of Taiwan via migration even though little is known about the migratory patterns of bats. Closely related CoV can be detected in the same bat species living at locations separated by thousands of miles (Drexler et al., 2010) and different CoV species or genera can be found in different bat species living at the same roosting sites (Chu et al., 2006; Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008; Tong et al., 2009; Drexler et al., 2010) .

Because of the ability of fly and migrate and the tendency to live in the large sizes of social groups, bats are predisposed to maintain and transport viruses to other mammals for the possible outbreaks of epidemics (Bennett, 2006) . Habitat types of bats include caves, trees and human-made constructions. The accumulation of bat faeces in schools or houses posts a potential risk for public health (Dobson, 2005) . As a poten-tial zoonotic pathogen, CoV is regarded as particularly significant because its high mutation rate, high frequency of recombination, faecal-oral transmission, and environment resistance of faeces-immersed virus particles (Casanova et al., 2010; Graham and Baric, 2010; Geller et al., 2012) . The investigation of RNA or infectious particles of CoV in the faeces accumulated on the ground under the roosting locations near or within human community, like Scotophilus bats in schools and houses, can be used to evaluate the exposure risk of CoV to human.

Female bats had significantly higher detection rate for bat CoV in this study, especially Rhinolophus monoceros (38% in females and 8% in males). In breeding season, female bats and their offspring tend to roost together as maternity colony and viruses are easier to circulate in large number (Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008) .

No evidence of recombination was detected between bat CoV 1A, 1B, HKU8, 512, HKU2 and SARSr CoV isolated from Miniopterus bats (Chu et al., 2006) . In Kenya, bat CoV 1A was isolated in Miniopterus africanus, Miniopterus minor and Miniopterus natalensis, and both bat CoV 1A and HKU8 can be isolated in Miniopterus inflatus (Tong et al., 2009) . In Bulgaria, bat CoV 1A, HKU-7, and HKU-8 were detected in Miniopterus schreibersii but not Rhinolophus and Hipposideros bats although all three bat species shared the same cave (Woo et al., 2012) . Since Miniopterus bats are migratory and the distance of migration is reported to be several hundreds of kilometers (Ramos Pareira et al., 2009) , it is implied that Miniopterus bat CoV might be transmitted between Hong Kong, Japan, even Europe as a result of bat migration. Further investigations on the distribution of bat CoV and interactions between migratory and endemic bat species are required for the close monitoring on SARSr-CoV and other bat CoV in Taiwan.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 203, "text": "(Chu et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 381, "end": 400, "text": "(Tong et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 581, "end": 599, "text": "(Woo et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 725, "end": 746, "text": "Pareira et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study partially filled a knowledge gap regarding the prevalence and distribution of CoV in different bat species of Taiwan.
