Design and methods: The time of immersion and extraction and the ratios (material/solvent) of the combination of YPS and FSI were optimized on the basis of polysaccharide and flavonoid yields via orthogonal design. The optimal result was used in the 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and animal experiments to test the antioxidant activity, which is reflected by superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity serum levels. The optimal extraction process was determined using various ingredients to obtain complex extracts with high active ingredient content and antioxidant activity. DPPH assay results showed that the optimized ingredients have antioxidant effects, and the combination had better antioxidation function than YPS in vitro. The combination also showed synergistic antioxidant activity compared with YPS in vivo.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress is caused by excessive free radicals when the body encounters various external damages or stimulations. Highly active and unstable molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species have a strong oxidation effect. Multiple organ dysfunction and failure are caused by excessive free radicals or the decreased ability of scavenging free radicals [1, 2] . Many diseases can cause oxidative stress and accumulation of free radicals, which lead to lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane, changes in its permeability, and damage to structural proteins; they react with intracellular nucleic acids and cause cell death, such as in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [3] . When the accumulation of free radical molecules greatly exceed the body's ability to scavenge, the oxidation and antioxidant system become disordered, further leading to tissue damage and serious diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and neurological disease. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are especially effective on anti-oxidation on the basis of free radical scavenging capacity, which has the advantages of high efficiency and low toxicity. Therefore, Chinese herbal medicine has become one of the focuses in the field of research.",

Some representative points were selected from the comprehensive experiment on the basis of the orthogonality of the orthogonal table, which could achieve the equivalent of a large number of comprehensive tests with a minimum number of tests, The orthogonal design is frequently used because of its high efficiency, speed, and cost. It considerably reduces the number of experiments. In the present study, the optimal extraction process of MYP was obtained via orthogonal design on the basis of polysaccharide and total flavonoid contents ( Table  2) . YPS has antioxidant function; polysaccharide is the active component of thisfunction [17, 18] . YPS can scavenge ROS, such as superoxide anion (O2 -), hydroxyl radical (\u2212OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It can also complex metal ions which is necessary for the production of living oxygen to achieve antioxidant activity in the body [19] . Flavonoids have antioxidant properties [20] , and can inhibit -OH-induced lipid peroxidation and nonenzymatic glycosylation [21] , which are the active ingredients of FSI in terms of oxidation resistance [22] . Thus, polysaccharide and total flavonoid contents were used as indicators ( Table 2) to determine the optimal extraction process of undergoing redox reactions in different ways in the organisms. The content of the active ingredient of the extract from the raw material was closely related to the extraction method. The optimal extraction process could improve the contents of the active ingredient of the compound compared with other conventional methods. MYP could obtain more polysaccharides and total flavonoids than FSI and YPS (Table 8 ) possibly due to the \"co-dissolution\" phenomenon in the extraction process.",

DPPH is a free radical with relative stability and could attract electrons from antioxidant [23] or hydrogen atoms. Thus, the determination of DPPH free radical scavenging activity is based on the reduction of DPPH ethanol solution in the presence of hydrogen supplying antioxidants which form the non-free radical form of DPPH-H because of the formation of stable molecules. The assay could accommodate many samples in a short period and is sensitive enough to detect active ingredients at low concentrations [24] . In the present study, the free radical scavenging capacities of antioxidant compounds present in extracts were determined to measure their hydrogen donating ability against reactive nitrogen (DPPH radical) species. The concluded that the compatibility of the two had a synergistic effect. MYP exhibited a synergistic antioxidant action in vitro (Fig.3) . Most antioxidants protect the organisms through redox reaction by inhibiting the generation of oxygen anions and scavenging free radicals. Lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction of free radical formation in the lipid parts of cellular membranes induced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide and/or Cu 2+ ions. Flavonoids protect the membrane from the damage and destruction of lipid molecules; suppressed H2O2\u2212 provokes changes in cell membrane elasticity and its morphological properties [25] . Flavonoids scavenge free radicals, inhibit the lipid peroxidation induced by hydroxyl radicals, and reduce the transmission of automatic oxidation chain reaction to exert antioxidant effect on the body and protect the structure and function of cell membrane [25] . Polysaccharides can act as electron or hydrogen donors to scavenge hydroxyl radicals [26] . They can also directly remove ROS and complex the metal ions necessary for the ROS production to achieve the antioxidant effect of the organisms. In the present study, MYP could significantly improve the antioxidant function in mice (Fig.4) . The antioxidant activity of FSI and YPS was probably through the polysaccharides and total flavonoids, and their combination could contribute to the easy dissolution and absorption of the effective ingredients. The total flavonoids in S. japonica have antioxidant and renal protective functions [20, 27] , and rutin could protect against ultraviolet B radiation through the alteration of microRNA expression [28] .",

SOD, GSH-Px and catalase (CAT) are important antioxidant enzymes that can adjust the balance in biological systems [31] .ROS are balanced by the antioxidative defense system, which include SOD, CAT and GSH-Px under normal conditions. When an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants occurs, oxidative stress is reached [32] . SOD and GSH-Px protect the cell from oxidative damage by removing excessive MDA and ROS [33] . The antioxidant process of the effective components of YPS and FSI in tissues is shown in Fig.5 . Virus infection could cause ROS release, which leads to oxidative stress in the body and increases the sensitivity of host cells to pre-oxidative factors, resulting in extensive damage; it activates phagocytes and releases pre-oxidative cytokines, such as IL-1 [34] . Influenza viral infection could lead to the destruction of body's oxidative balance, thereby damaging the tissues and cells via oxidative stress and resulting in changes in cell membrane structure and enzyme inactivation, which is conducive to the release of influenza virus [35] . The mechanism of COVID-19 is organ damage caused by a large amount of free radicals produced by an extreme immune response [3, 36] . YPS could prevent and cure influenza virus [37] ; it has been recognized as a promising antiviral drug against RNA viruses (including influenza virus) [38] . YPS inhibits the replication of influenza virus and inactivates the virus [39] . Rutin could inhibit influenza virus by affecting the monooxygenase activity [40] , and it is widely found in flavonoids. MYP may resist COVID-19 by scavenging free radicals and improving the antioxidant activity of the body to protect the tissues. Therefore, the combination of YPS and FSI may be used to treat viral infections on the basis of free radical scavenging capacity .",
