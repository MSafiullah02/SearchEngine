The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies.",

The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate antiepidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.",

Compared to SARS-CoV (9.56% mortality) and MERS-CoV (34.4% mortality), the COVID-19 appears to be less virulent at this point except for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (table 1). COVID-19 was confirmed as subject to human-to-human transmission and it is very contagious. The basic reproduction number R0 for COVID-19 was estimated by WHO and some research institutes in the range of 1.4-6.6 (table 2). This value is slightly higher than that of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and much higher than that of influenza and Ebola. The incubation days of COVID-19 in Wuhan city is 5-10 days with a mean of 7 days (Fan et al., 2020). On average, the duration from confirmed stage to cure or death is 10 days in nation-wide reporting according to Guan et al. (2020) . A long incubation period and an associated large number of patients with mild symptoms increase the difficulty of prevention and control of the epidemic. The likelihood of travel-related risks of the disease spreading has been noted by Bogoch et al. (2020) and Cao et al. (2020a) wherein they indicated the potentials for further regional and global spread (Leung et al., 2020).",

Suspicious cases were confined in monitored house arrest. Most exits and entries into cities were shut down. Certain categories of contact were banned; for instance, universities and schools remained closed, and many businesses remained closed. People were asked to remain in their homes for as much time as possible (Fahrion et al., 2020) .

The failure of factories to start on time and run normally after the Spring Festival also had severe effects on Chinese national and global economies. Ayittey et al. (2020) and CNN Business (2020) estimated it would result in China's GDP declining 4.5% year-on-year in Q1 in 2020; the loss in China would be up to $62 billion in the same quarter. Zhang (2020), Huang (2020), Li and Zhang (2020) and IMF News (2020) considered the growth of China's GDP would be 5.0%-5.6% in 2020, decrease 0.5-1.1 percentage points from 2019. IHS Markit (2020) estimated a reduction of global real GDP of 0.8% in Q1 and 0.5% in Q2 in 2020, and the global real GDP would be reduced by 0.4% in 2020. The longer the duration of the epidemic, the more negative the impacts on China and the rest of the world, with the latter effects largely centered on disruptions in increasingly complicated supply chains. Therefore, it is important to estimate the dynamic evolution mechanism of the epidemic in mainland China, to find when the epidemic will end and how this result depends on different containment strategies. These are issues of great significance with important clinical and policy implications (Joseph et al., 2020).",

Assume that the average number of exposed cases that are generated by one infected person of COVID-19 is \u03b2. The parameter \u03b2 is similar to the basic reproduction number which can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.

The \u0394(t) is the ratio of people with vaccination at time t. \u03b8(t) is the natural mortality of the population in a region at time t (figure 3).

We estimated the model parameters reversely for the QSEIR model from published information with statistical methods and stochastic simulations; from these experiments, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test results. The application verified that the method is effective. The paper not only predicted the peak number and peak date of confirmed cases, but also provided estimates of the sensitivity of parameters of QSEIR, the duration of the epidemic and effects of different containment strategies at the same time. The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world.",

However, due to the limited emerging understanding of the new virus and its transmission mechanisms, their results were in the range from January 14, 2020 (Yan et al., 2020) to the beginning of March, 2020 (Geng et al., 2020) (see table 3). Most of them are in the mid of February, 2020, which are approximate to the real date February 17, 2020. The results of Wang et al. (2020b), Gamero et al. (2020) Xiong and Yan (2020), Li et al.

Hence, it is imperative that the development of vaccines and specific drugs for COVID-19 should be promoted by many countries with the technical resources to conduct the necessary high-level research. Until they appear, it is the most important that appropriate quarantine measures are retained. In mainland China, the quarantine measures should not be relaxed before the end of March, 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April, 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences (Editorial, 2020).",
