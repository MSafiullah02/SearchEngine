In many countries, including the United States, England, Canada, etc., the definition of community pharmacy includes both retail pharmacies that mainly consist of chain pharmacies and outpatient pharmacies located in primary care clinics that considered as part of the primary care system. In addition to dispensing prescription medications and providing related pharmacy services, these pharmacies also have over-the-counter medications, supplements and other healthcare related products and devices for sale.",

They follow the regulations of local and national government, and provide prescription medications dispensing service and other pharmacy-related services. Retail pharmacies in China provide some prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, supplements, and health-related products and devices for sale. They are not considered part of the healthcare system as they practice follow different companies' regulations. The professional skills of pharmacy staff and pharmacists work in these retail pharmacies varies significantly, and are generally not considered as healthcare professionals. 4 Special needs of PC services during the COVID-19 pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of PC services is beyond the scope of traditional practice of community pharmacists, which can be divided into two parts: the need of pandemic prevention and control and the need from patients of pharmacy-related issues. To promote the pandemic control, community patients need to be screened properly and suspected patients shall be referred to designated medical institutions in a timely manner. 5 The public also need to master effective personal protection skills to control the community transmission of COVID-19. 2,6,7 Patients on medical isolated observation or patients with mild COVID-19 on treatment at home are lacking guidance on home care strategies. 8 The pharmacy-related needs of community patients have similarities with the traditional patient population, but with different emphasis. For example, when providing consulting services to community patients, instead of focusing on medications as usual, their questions are mainly on the scientific prevention knowledge and basic information about COVID-19, such as mask selection and typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19. For chronic disease patients, especially those in communities under quarantine, drug supply and patients' compliance are facing a greater challenge, though the safety and effectiveness of treatment is also important for this patient population. Thus, community pharmacists shall learn to switch gears when needed from providing professional knowledge on medication use only to fulfilling community patients' various needs.",

[12] [13] [14] A scoping review published in 2012 suggested that community pharmacists has provided a wide range of clinical services in the public health area, primarily on smoking cessation, health eating and lifestyle changes, infection control and prevention, promoting cardiovascular disease control, prevention and management of drug abuse, misuse and addiction. 10 The community pharmacy practice in China has developed rapidly since the 21st century with the progress of national healthcare reformation. Pharmaceutical services including chronic disease management, patient education and consulting, scientific knowledge popularization in communities are provided in most of the community pharmacies in China in addition to drug dispensing. Although gap still exists between the PC services being provided in China and some developed countries, the experience Chinese community pharmacists gained during the COVID-19 outbreak is of great value for community pharmacies around the world for the following three reasons.",
