Rapid and accurate detection of respiratory viruses is crucial for appropriate patient treatment and prevention of endemic spread. Objectives: We compared two multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of respiratory viral pathogens. Methods: A total of 245 respiratory specimens (229 sputum samples, 14 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, 6 nasal swabs, 3 throat swabs, 7 unknown) were analyzed using two multiplex assays: One-step RV real-time PCR (BioSewoom, Seoul, Korea) and Seeplex RV 12 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The results were further confirmed using sequencing as a reference. Results: Among 245 samples (265 identifications including co-infections), the identification of respiratory viruses was 44.9% (119/265), 44.2% (117/265) and 45.3% (120/265) by One-step RV assay, Seeplex RV assay and sequencing, respectively. The concordance rate between One-step RV assay and sequencing was 95.5% (253/265), and that between Seeplex RV assay and sequencing was 89.8% (238/265) (P = 0.0189). The sensitivities of One-step RV and Seeplex RV assays were 94.1% [95% confidential interval (CI), 88.3%-97.6%] and 83.3% (95% CI, 75.4%-89.5%), respectively (P = 0.0002). The specificities of One-step RV and Seeplex RV assays were 96.6% (95% CI, 92.2%-98.9%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 90.3%-98.0%), respectively. Conclusion: Although the performances of One-step RV and Seeplex RV assays were overall comparable, One-step RV assay showed better sensitivity and concordance with sequencing.

Respiratory infections caused by virus or bacteria are often indistinguishable, and rapid and accurate detection is crucial for appropriate patient treatment and prevention of endemic spread; therefore, selecting an appropriate diagnostic test is indispensable (3) .
