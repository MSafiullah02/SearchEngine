Further, acute infections could be more effectively prevented with a passive immune strategy, as evidenced by the successful treatment of healthcare workers infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus by transfusion with convalescent phase plasma obtained from SARS patients [1] and successful protection against viral infection in a mouse model of SARS-coronavirus infection with human MAbs (HuMAbs) obtained from a patient\u2019s memory cell repertoire [2]. Also, studies of Spanish flu that evaluated the effects of transfusion with influenza-convalescent blood products may offer insights regarding potential treatments for H5N1 infection [3]. Furthermore, it has been reported that an avian flu patient recovered following treatment with convalescent plasma from a donor [4]. Recently, there have been several trials using MAbs with neutralizing activity for the prevention of acute severe symptoms of influenza virus infection including H5N1 [5], [6], [7], [8]. Further, protective properties of MAbs directed at the stem region of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus H1N1 [9] and H5N1 [6], [7], [8] were demonstrated in mice. Based on these data, preparation of HuMAbs against viruses causing severe acute diseases that have potential therapeutic applications becomes of great importance.",

Recently, a rapid cloning method for high-affinity HuMAbs against influenza virus was established using single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the immunoglobulin variable regions. For that, single-sorted plasma cells secreting influenza-specific IgG+ derived from influenza-vaccinated healthy volunteers were used [10]. In this study, we employed a novel approach for the development of HuMAbs against influenza viruses using a newly prepared cell line, named SPYMEG, that was generated by fusion of SP2 myeloma cells of murine origin and MEG-01 human megakaryoblastic leukemia cells [11] as partner cells with high fusion efficiency with human lymphocytes (Kuhara, Personal Communication). Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from influenza-vaccinated volunteers, we developed several individual HuMAbs that showed broad neutralizing activity against human influenza A (H3N2) and B viruses.",

In addition, cross-reactivity was also observed for most of them in the VN test. This result may suggest that since humans have history of exposure to influenza virus antigens by natural infection as well as influenza vaccination, the immune cells recognizing global epitopes in the influenza virus seem to quickly respond by vaccination and therefore the use of PBMCs few weeks post-vaccination for cell fusion may be advantageous for the preparation of a wide-range subtype-reactive MAbs like B-1 and D-1. Both HuMAbs recognized two separate regions (aa 173\u2013181 and aa 227\u2013239), located close to each other in the three dimensional structure of HA1, a novel human epitope. This result suggested that B-1 and D-1 recognized a conformational epitope. There have been several studies of HA epitopes of influenza A H3N2, using murine MAbs [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], or rabbit [26], [27] and human [28] polyclonal antisera. Moreover, a mouse MAb recognizing a conformational epitope containing aa 186, 220, 229 and 230 was reported [23]. However, this epitope overlapped only at aa 229 and 230 with the epitope of B-1 and D-1. It is noteworthy to mention that the above two HuMAbs recognizing the same epitope with a highly conserved sequence were independently prepared from two volunteers, as confirmed from the different sequences of their CDRs.",

(A) Based on the reactivity of B-1 and D-1 HuMAbs with a series of overlapping peptides covering sequences of the HA1 region, amino acid sequences from aa 167\u2013187 and from aa 225\u2013241 are shown. Common amino acid sequences reactive with HA1 peptides are aa 173\u2013181 and from aa 227\u2013239 that are boxed by red and green, respectively. (B) The monomeric structure of H3 HA is shown. The image was created with RasMol 2.6.4, and the HA structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB Accession No. 2VIU). The positions of the binding sites are shown as red dots (aa 173\u2013181) and green dots (aa 227\u2013239). The receptor-binding sites are shown as black ribbons. (C) The deduced amino acid sequences of CDRs in the VH and VL of HuMAbs B-1 and D-1 are shown.",
