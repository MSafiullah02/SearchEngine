Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, social distancing is one fundamental measure which has already adopted by many countries. At the technical level, this prioritises contact tracing solutions, which can alert the users who have been in close contact with the infected persons and meanwhile allow heath authorities to take proper actions. In this paper, we examine several existing privacy-aware contact tracing solutions and analyse their (dis)advantages. At the end, we describe several major observations and outline an interdisciplinary research agenda towards more comprehensive and effective privacy-aware contact tracing solutions.",

From the public information, the epidemic has been successfully controlled in China and only dozens of new cases are identified daily now. In a sharp contrast, the numbers are still rapidly growing in the western democracies, where some of these extreme measures cannot be easily enforced due to the potential violation of fundamental rights. Nevertheless, in order to slow down the virus spreading and reduce the pressure on medical systems, social distancing is widely promoted and enforced, furthermore many countries are investigating the concept of contact tracing. Without careful considerations, contact tracing can turn into a massive surveillance tool so that individual's privacy can be seriously damaged, see the case analysis for China 3 and for South Korea 4 . What makes things harder is that the perception of privacy heavily depends on the political regime and the underlying culture, see the analysis by Asghar et al. towards Singapore's TraceTogether app 5 .",

By tracing the contacts of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, public health aims to reduce infections in the population 17 . In practice, contact tracing is widely performed for diseases like sexually transmitted infections (including HIV) and virus infections (e.g. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19). Despite some pioneering attempts in applying advanced ICT technologies, e.g. the FluPhone [9] , contact tracing has mainly been implemented manually by medical personnel. Regardless, this approach has been proven effective in combating contiguous diseases because it can at least (1) interrupt ongoing transmission and reduce spread, alert contacts to the possibility of infection and offer preventive counseling or prophylactic care and (2) allow the medical professionals to learn about the epidemiology in a particular population.",

However, things will change when more and more individual users are infected and diagnosed. By then, MoH will have decrypted data for most of the individuals and learned their relative location data at certain points of time. If a big portion of the Singapore population has deployed the app, and then the location data on their smartphones would provide MoH a very clear mobility view of the whole Singapore population. Without using secure hardware or other trusted computing technology, a malicious user can potentially manipulate the location data collected by the app, e.g. delete or add entries. Moreover, an attacker can mount relay attacks, e.g. to relay the Bluetooth signal from Alice's smartphone to Bob's smartphone even when they are far from each other. To this end, some other attacks, demonstrated in Vaudenay's analysis [8] against DP-3T solution by Troncoso et al. [4] , can also 20 http://tiny.cc/fljqmz apply. Regarding the solutions employing Bluetooth for distance measurement, one attack deserves special attention. An attacker can place a Bluetooth range extender in a relatively populated place, such as a city square, and as a result it will make any pair of users a close contact to each other.

This is a theoretical cryptographic solution, which covers the matching between an infected and other individual users while ignoring other aspects of a contact tracing solution. With respect to the cryptographic design, scalability will be a bottleneck. For any user j, HA will need to prepare garbled circuits for all the infected victims, and interact with user j in the tracing phase. When the sizes of infected populations and the requesters become large, the complexity for HA will be formidable.

With regard to its pan European ambition, it is not clear how HAs and backend servers from different countries can efficiently coordinate with each other to take prompt responses. It also remains open how users' privacy will be infected if the credentials of some HAs and backend servers are compromised. We want to point out that the hashchain-based method of generating daily keys, see more information in the initialisation phase, brings linkability risks when an individual's credential is leaked to an attacker, e.g. via malware. For example, if the attacker learns SK i,x then it can compute identifiers for day x + 1 and so on. Then, the attacker can link user i to his broadcasted identifiers, either collected by the attacker itself or or bought from other attackers. This could lead to disclosure of absolute location data points of user i.",

Referring to the tracing phase description, if an identifier EphID * appears in his local storage user j learns the exact time stamp when the perceived risk occurs. This can very likely enable user j to link EphID * to the real person, whose device has broadcasted EphID * , due to the fact that user j can be close to very few users at a specific time stamp. Moreover, this also raises a concern of targeted identification attack. If an attacker wants to find out whether or not some users have been infected, then he can simply get close enough to them and make their devices exchange identifiers (of course he should record the time stamps), and finally he can make a decision if identifiers have been matched at these time stamps. In contrast, the TraceTogether avoids this problem by letting MoH calculate the infection risk for encountered users. Overall, the DP-3T protocol leaks too much unnecessary information about the infected users to the public and raises serious privacy concerns without deploying any further countermeasure. One possible solution is to deploy a two party secure computation protocol between the backend server and user j, for the latter to only learn a risk score. How to scale this up is a very practical problem to be addressed.",

There is a rush for the academia to propose new technical solutions and for the industry to launch new apps, and new initiatives pop up every day. These efforts will somehow contribute to the fight against the pandemic, at least raise the awareness and help start discussions. Unfortunately, it is a pity that many solutions are based on assumptions which are unrealistic and hamper their usefulness and massive adoption.

In addition, a number of exceptional situations have not been taken into account. For instance, the neighbours of an infected and quarantined victim can be in very close range and be classified to be of high risk, while the truth is that they are in different apartments or houses so that the risk of being infected is low. Inaccurate distance estimation and false risk alerts will cause unnecessary panic in the population and also waste a lot of resources in the healthcare system to address the fake suspects. Moreover, the scenario of indirect contact has been ignored most of the time. Due to the fact that COVID-19 can be transmitted via indirect contact. Ignoring this scenario makes the existing contact tracing solutions less practical and effective than expected.",

It is mostly about an individual evaluates his risk of being infected based on his contact history with the infected victims. However, as we have described in the beginning of Section 2 and Section 2.1, contact tracing is supposed to enable health authority and medical personnel not only to study the epidemic or pandemic at the global level but also to help the individual at the individual level. This raises an open question how the health authority and medical personnel can collect the necessary information and perform their normal duties. Inevitably, new privacy-aware solutions need to be designed and implemented to fulfill the objectives of a comprehensive contact tracing yet minimizes information disclosure. One root problem, facing both existing and new solutions, is that a consensus on the trust relationship between the different players in the scope of contact tracing is missing. When an app is deployed, more practical questions can occur. For example, how the results from the app of Google and Apple 21 should be interpreted, how the liability is distributed, and can an individual interact with the health authority and medical personnel on the basis of these results?",

Consequently, the results of contact tracing could have been manipulated to a large extent, and enable the dishonest users and attackers to disrupt the service and commit various fraud activities. Of particular importance is that the lacking of authenticity can also lead to the breach of privacy, as demonstrated by Vaudenay [8] .

Instead of simply providing a dichotomy choice through \"opt-in\" and \"opt-out\", it is important to incentivize the participation of individual users and other players, e.g. by employing technologies such as DLT or Blockchain.

They will store a (T ID i,x , T ID j,x , Sigstren) locally in their smartphones, respectively. The parameter Sigstren indicates the Bluetooth signal strength between their devices. -In the reporting phase, suppose that user i has been tested positive for COVID-19, then she is obliged to share with MoH the locally-stored pairs (T ID i,x , T ID j,x ) for all relevant j and x. -In the tracing phase, after receiving the pairs from user i, MoH decrypts every T ID j,x and obtains ID j . Based on ID j , MoH can looks up N U M j and then contact user j for further instructions.",
