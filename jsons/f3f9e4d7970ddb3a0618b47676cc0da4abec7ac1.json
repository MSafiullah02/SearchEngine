Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study. We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured.",

Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment. Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively. Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves). The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%). After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes. Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms. Conclusion: The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases. Positive psychological intervention is necessary.",

According to WHO daily situation report, after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) outbreak, 22,073 COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers have been reported to the WHO as of Wednesday, 8 April 2020 [1] . The number of healthcare workers infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached 1716 China wide on February 11, 2020; among them, 1502 cases were in Hubei province; with 1102 in Wuhan [2] . As of early March, the infected number increased to 3300 and at least 22 died in China, and there were over 2600 infected with 13 died in Italy as of 20 March, 2020 [3] [4] [5] . Reports from medical staff describe physical and mental exhaustion, the torment of difficult triage decisions, and the pain of losing their patients and colleagues, all in addition to the infectious risk. Healthcare workers are the pillar for fighting against this pandemic; hence, preventing them to be infected is a big challenge for maintaining a strong fighting force, high morale, and energy for fighting. Now to protect healthcare workers away from infection has aroused great concern, many experts published opinions [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] to appeal to worldwide for paying attention to protect health care workers from woefully unprepared status.",

At that time most medical staffs usually used ordinary medical masks without any other medical equipment during these patients' diagnosis and treatment [15] . Reports showed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by the infection of 15 healthcare professionals after close contact with infected patients in a Wuhan hospital [16] . For nearly a month, neither the public nor healthcare professionals were clear about all the characteristics of COVID-19. During that time many medical staffs were not taking enhanced personal protective measures. Our results were confirmed repeatedly by cross-checking information from the departments' directors of infected hospital workers and participants. Lack of effective protective measures during the early stage is an important risk factor, and the main reason for transmission was failure to protect people working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected patients. The prevention and control plan before diagnosis can help to explain this. Only a fifth of infected staffs were routinely equipped with protective face shields, clothing or shoe covers. Most of them just wore the usual protective equipment. In addition, improper use of PPE (e.g., repeated use of masks) is also a factor involved in increasing the infection risk [4] .",

The personal protection awareness of medical staff increased rapidly and the number of confirmed cases decreased rapidly during February 2020. We conducted an in-depth telephone interviews for cases confirmed in February 2020. For infected healthcare professionals beyond the concentrated outbreak period in January 2020, we cannot rule out that they may have experienced a longer incubation period before they were diagnosed as COVID-19. In addition, some confirmed cases had worked in the frontline for a long time maybe leading to a lowered resistance to infection. The interview information showed that the last case we included is a frontline nurse who had been engaged in combating COVID-19; she claimed that she was fully equipped by uniform standards at work, and she had frequently conducted CPR for confirmed patients before her own infection was confirmed. She believed that she was infected by confirmed patients, but was not sure about exactly when or which patient was involved. Moreover, the first group of infected medical staff also forms part of the chain of transmission of nosocomial infections. 39 cases in our study suggested that their route of infection may be \"close contact with colleagues who were subsequently\", but they were infected during the early stage of epidemic.",

From tracking their questionnaire data we found that inadequate protective equipment and insufficient protection of protective equipment were frequently selected. The percentage of staff selecting \"personal protective equipment used more often\" was higher in HRDs than LRDs in routine work. This is maybe the reason why more infected cases appeared in LRDs. However, we can only hypothesize why this occurred, because normally people don't use sophisticated infection control procedures routinely in LRDs and to do so would be poor use of resources and also frightening for the public.",
