            "text": "Dengue fever is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease and is caused by four closely related serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV), which affect humans in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide (Bhatt et al., 2013). The presentation of the infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to the severe forms of the disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Guo et al., 2017). However, there is no satisfactory vaccine and no means of predicting disease severity at an early stage in DENV patients (Collins and Barrett, 2017). Both viral and host factors, including the host\u2019s immune function, seem to be related to disease severity (Duangchinda et al., 2010, Rothman, 2011, Weiskopf and Sette, 2014). However, the immunological processes during DENV infection are not yet completely defined. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the balance between immune-mediated protection and pathogenesis during DENV infections is a critical step toward the development of safe and effective DENV therapeutics and vaccines.",

In response to infection, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are primed in the T cell zone of secondary lymphoid organs and differentiate into effector cytotoxic T cells to eliminate infected cells (Mueller et al., 2013). Recently, a subset of CD8+ T cells with high C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) expression have been shown to possess antiviral properties in chronic virus infections, during which CD8+ T cells generally display exhausted phenotypes (Cross et al., 2015, He et al., 2016, Leong et al., 2016, Quigley et al., 2007). In addition, CXCR5+CD8+ T cells exhibit a more potent pro-inflammatory function than CXCR5\u2212CD8+ T cells during chronic SIV infections (Mylvaganam et al., 2017). Recent studies have reported CXCR5+CD8+ T cells from chronic LCMV and HIV infections selectively entered into B-cell follicles eradicating both infected follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and B cells, exhibited more potent cytotoxicity, and demonstrated synergistic therapeutic potential when combined with PD-L1 neutralization (He et al., 2016, Quigley et al., 2007). Upon adoptive transfer, mice receiving CXCR5+CD8+ T cells presented significantly lower viral load than mice receiving CXCR5\u2212CD8+ T cells.",

At present, the expression of PD-1 on CXCR5+CD8+ T cells during viral infections remains controversial.

There are different opinions regarding the expression of PD-1 on CXCR5+CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infections. We found high PD-1 expression on CXCR5+CD8+ T cells compared to CXCR5-CD8+ T cells, consistent with other findings (Im et al., 2016, Petrovas et al., 2017). Additionally, higher levels of PD-1+CXCR5+CD8+ T cells were found in DENV2 patients. Interestingly, higher levels of PD-1+CXCR5+CD8+ T cells were found in DENV2 patients with kidney injury or those with lower platelets numbers. These findings suggested that PD-1+CXCR5+CD8+ T cells could be negatively associated with disease progression.",

These observations were in partial agreement with studies performed in chronic LCMV-infected mice and follicular lymphoma, which showed that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells expressed more proinflammatory cytokines than CXCR5\u2212CD8+ T cells (He et al., 2016, Eppy et al., 2016). Further investigation into early immune signatures will help to address what mechanisms influence the in vivo generation of these antiviral CXCR5+CD8+ T cells, but our data in combination with these recently published studies highlight the importance of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells and underscore the need to develop immune-based strategies capable of generating these cells in vivo as a means of targeting and eliminating DENV2-infected cells.",

Studies have shown high levels of IL-6 in dengue infected liver sections and elevated IL-10 levels in patients with severe dengue (Oliveira et al., 2017, Pandey et al., 2015). Consistent with other findings (Oliveira et al., 2017, Pandey et al., 2015, Flores-Mendoza et al., 2017), we observed high levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-10 late in the course of DENV2 infection. Although IL-10 was generally regarded as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, several studies suggested that IL-10 contributed to antitumor immunity by assisting the expansion of tumor-resident CD8+ T cells (Emmerich et al., 2012, Mumm et al., 2011). In mice with coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis, IL-10+CD8+ T cells demonstrated more potent activation and cytolytic activity than IL-10-CD8+ T cells, which suggest that IL-10 might improve CD8+ T cell survival and activation during acute inflammation (Trandem et al., 2011). In this study, we also observed that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells in DENV2 patients exhibited high IL-10 secretion, while at the same time, the level of IFN-\u03b3, a canonical CD8+ T cell activation marker, increased as would be expected under high IL-10 levels (Inoue et al., 2006, Jarnicki et al., 2006). Combining these results, CXCR5+CD8+ T cells might have contributed to controlling DENV2 infection through IL-10-mediated stimulation rather than suppression.",
