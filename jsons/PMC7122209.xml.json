Human blastomycosis was first reported by Gilchrist in 1894 in a case of cutaneous disease first mistakenly attributed to protozoan disease (Gilchrist 1894). Four years later, Gilchrist and Stokes isolated the causative agent, a fungus they called (Gilchrist and Stokes 1898). The first case of canine blastomycosis was reported by Meyer in 1912 (Meyer 1912). Since then, blastomycosis has been recognized as a common and serious disease of people and animals in endemic/enzootic areas.",

Blastomycosis is acquired primarily through inhalation of airborne conidia of Blastomyces species. These are liberated from the mold phase, which is associated with moist, acidic, sandy soils enriched with decaying organic matter and animal droppings (Restrepo et al. 2000). Aerosolization of conidia is promoted by disturbances to soil that may be caused by natural phenomena or due to human or animal activities such as excavation (Bradsher 2014b). Upon inhalation, conidia undergo a temperature-dependent transformation to yeast-like cells, capable of causing local and disseminated disease (Bradsher 2014b).",

Autochthonous blastomycosis has also been reported from most of Africa (Broc and Haddad 1952; Carman et al. 1989), parts of India (Randhawa et al. 1983), and the Middle East (Kuttin et al. 1978; Kingston et al. 1980). However, the etiological agent may not always be the same species between and within geographical regions. Genetic studies of large collections of B. dermatitidis isolates have identified the presence of two distinct genetic populations (Meece et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2013), leading Brown et al. (2013) to conclude the presence of a cryptic species which they called . These species are indistinguishable in morphology, physiology, and in most currently applied molecular bar codes (Dukik et al. 2017). Although clinical and demographic phenotypic differences have been suggested (Meece et al. 2013), the clinical significance of distinguishing B. dermatitidis from B. gilchristii is not yet established. Geographic differences exist, and epidemiological differences (such as outbreak potential) are surmised by the fact that isolates identified as B. gilchristii predominate in northern Ontario and Wisconsin, areas with the highest reported incidence of blastomycosis (Brown et al. 2013).",

In fact, isolates from Africa have been observed to be slightly smaller (Kaufman et al. 1983), more difficult to convert to yeast phase (Lombardi et al. 1988), and have different antigenic expression (Kaufman et al. 1983) than isolates from North America. Moreover, clinical differences in human disease have been suggested (Vandepitte and Gatti 1972). Strikingly, no cases of animal blastomycosis have been reported from Africa (Carman et al. 1989). Recently, a new species of Blastomyces, B. percursus, was described from Israel and South Africa (Dukik et al. 2017); and have also been confirmed in isolates from sub-Saharan Africa (Brown et al. 2013), and so the extent that disease is attributable to each species there and elsewhere outside of North America has not yet been defined.",

Outbreaks have involved both rural and urban exposures (Smith and Gauthier 2015). Recreational outdoor activities and especially water activities as well as exposure to excavation and construction are frequently implicated in human and canine blastomycosis (Baumgardner et al. 1995; Smith and Gauthier 2015). Proximity to waterways has been identified as a risk factor for sporadic blastomycosis in people (Baumgardner et al. 1992) and in dogs (Archer et al. 1987; Baumgardner et al. 1995; Arceneaux et al. 1998). For instance, case-control studies of canine blastomycosis in Louisiana and Wisconsin have identified residence within 400 m of a body of water to be a significant risk factor for the disease in dogs (Baumgardner et al. 1995; Arceneaux et al. 1998). In Louisiana, Arceneaux et al. found the odds of living near water was tenfold higher for dogs with blastomycosis than controls (Arceneaux et al. 1998).",

By genotyping isolates from the initial and subsequent episodes in each respective patient using 27 polymorphic microsatellite markers, they demonstrated that relapse occurred in one case (concordance between the two isolates at 27/27 loci) and reinfection occurred in the other (concordance at just 15/27 loci) (Anderson et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Blastomycosis is most common in dogs residing in or visiting enzootic areas (Baumgardner et al. 1995). The incidence of blastomycosis in dogs is eight to ten times that of humans (Baumgardner et al. 1995; Herrmann et al. 2011), presumably related to time spent outdoors, proximity to soil, and activities, such as digging, that may result in soil disturbances and conidial exposure. Most affected dogs are immunocompetent (Sykes and Merkel 2014). The incidence appears to be highest in young, large sporting dogs and hounds, including coonhounds, pointers, Weimaraners (Rudmann et al. 1992), golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, and Doberman pinschers (Arceneaux et al. 1998). Sporting dogs may be more likely to be exposed due to selective use in hunting (Rudmann et al. 1992). Some but not all studies have found the disease is more common in intact males (Rudmann et al. 1992; Arceneaux et al. 1998). Blastomycosis has also been described in wild canids. For example, Nemeth et al. (2016) reviewed the database of wild animals sent to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative from 1991 to 2014. Blastomycosis was diagnosed in 14 wild canids, including 11 of 149 (7.6%) red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 3 of 185 (1.6%) gray wolves (Canis lupus).",

The concurrent or sequential infection of a person and his or her dog is common (Baumgardner et al. 1992) and likely due to a common exposure (Sarosi et al. 1979; Armstrong et al. 1987; Baumgardner et al. 1992). Even so, dogs appear to develop disease earlier (Sarosi et al. 1979). In experimental murine blastomycosis, larger inocula lead to earlier disease (Williams and Moser 1987), and it has been inferred that the shorter prepatent period in dogs reflects increased inocula from being closer to the ground (Legendre 2012). In any case, a history of blastomycosis in one\u2019s dog should raise suspicion for the disease in a person with a compatible syndrome (Sarosi et al. 1979).",

            "text": " Clinical signs encountered in persons with blastomycosis will depend on the organ systems involved, but clinicians should be aware of the protean nature of the disease (Bradsher 2014a). Pulmonary infection can be subclinical or can result in an acute or chronic pneumonia (Sarosi et al. 1974). Acute pulmonary blastomycosis can present with fevers, sepsis, and hypoxia, with clinical examination and radiographs consistent with focal airspace disease (Sarosi et al. 1974; Lemos et al. 2002). In other words, the disease can be indistinguishable from community-acquired (bacterial) pneumonia (Lemos et al. 2002; Bradsher 2014a; Alpern et al. 2016), and it is common for patients to receive multiple courses of antibiotics before the correct diagnosis is established (Alpern et al. 2016). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in 8\u201315% of cases of symptomatic blastomycosis (Meyer et al. 1993; Vasquez et al. 1998; Lemos et al. 2001; Azar et al. 2015) and is associated with mortality rates of at least 40% (Meyer et al. 1993; Vasquez et al. 1998; Lemos et al. 2001; Azar et al. 2015; Schwartz et al. 2016). Patients with chronic pulmonary involvement may present with chronic dyspnea, cough and hemoptysis, often accompanied by constitutional symptoms. The radiographic appearance is like acute disease but with a third of patients having mass-like lesions (Patel et al. 1999). Not surprisingly, chronic blastomycosis is frequently mistaken for pulmonary malignancies or tuberculosis (Lemos et al. 2002; Bradsher 2014a).",

The most common extrapulmonary site of blastomycosis is the skin, usually manifesting as ulcerative or verrucous lesions (Bradsher 2014b). Osteoarticular disease is the next most common form (Kralt et al. 2009). In a series of persons with osteoarticular blastomycosis, disease of the axial skeleton was most common, followed by long bones of the lower limb (Oppenheimer et al. 2007). Vertebral disease may rarely present with spinal cord compression syndromes (Saccente et al. 1998). As with bacterial osteomyelitis, disease of long bones most often localizes to the metaphyses (Oppenheimer et al. 2007). Arthritis is less common than osteomyelitis. It is generally monoarticular and mimics pyogenic bacterial septic arthritis (Oppenheimer et al. 2007). In males, the third most common site of extrapulmonary blastomycosis is the prostate and genitourinary system (Saccente and Woods 2010). Central nervous system disease is less common, occurring in approximately 5% of cases with extrapulmonary dissemination (Bariola et al. 2010). Patients may present with meningitis, encephalitis, or signs of a space-occupying lesion (Bush et al. 2013). Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis occurs and can have either lymphocytic or neutrophilic predominance (Bariola et al. 2010). Ocular involvement has been reported but it is uncommon (Lopez et al. 1994).",

Chest radiographs may show focal airspace disease or a \u201csnowstorm\u201d pattern of reticulonodular disease (Crews et al. 2008b) (Fig. 8.1). Ocular disease is much more common in dogs than in humans, occurring in up to half of all cases (Bloom et al. 1996; Arceneaux et al. 1998). Among these, bilateral disease occurs in half (Bloom et al. 1996). Ocular disease can be localized to anterior segments, posterior segments, or, most commonly, both (i.e., endophthalmitis) (Bloom et al. 1996). Like in human disease, cutaneous involvement is common in canine blastomycosis, occurring in approximately half of infected dogs (Arceneaux et al. 1998). An example of a dog with bilateral ocular and cutaneous disease is shown in Fig. 8.2. Other common sites of extrapulmonary disease include lymphatic and osteoarticular structures (Arceneaux et al. 1998). Central nervous system disease is less common, occurring in 6% of dogs in a series (Arceneaux et al. 1998). Cardiovascular blastomycosis has been reported in nine dogs (Langlois et al. 2013; Schmiedt et al. 2015); it is extraordinarily uncommon in people.",

Growth of white to buff colonies usually appears within 10\u201314 days but may require up to 6 weeks incubation (Bradsher 2014b). Microscopically, B. dermatitidis/gilchristii characteristically have conidiophores of varying lengths that run perpendicular to hyphae and terminate with single conidia that resemble \u201clollipops\u201d (Bradsher 2014b). In contradistinction, the conidia of B. percursus appear in clusters at the end of conidiophores (Dukik et al. 2017). Traditionally, conversion of the mold to a yeast phase at 37\u00b0C was performed for confirmation of the identification, but this is rarely done today (Saccente and Woods 2010). Most microbiology laboratories confirm identification of B. dermatitidis/gilchristii with a DNA probe (AccuProbe; GenProbe Inc., San Diego, CA), but cross-reactions can occur, including with other dimorphic fungi (Saccente and Woods 2010).",

In humans, the recommended treatment for mild to moderate pulmonary or extrapulmonary blastomycosis (other than osteoarticular or CNS disease) is itraconazole 200 mg once or twice daily for 6\u201312 months; treatment of osteoarticular disease should be for 12 months. Moderately severe to severe pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease should be treated preferably with lipid formulation amphotericin B (3\u20135 mg/kg) or alternatively amphotericin deoxycholate (0.7\u20131.0 mg/kg) until clinical improvement, followed by de-escalation to a triazole for 6\u201312 months (Chapman et al. 2008). Central nervous system disease should be treated with a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (3\u20135 mg/kg) (for 4\u20136 weeks or until clinical improvement) followed by step-down to a triazole for 12 months (Chapman et al. 2008; Limper et al. 2011).

Consequently, the roles of adjunctive, rescue therapies for ARDS caused by blastomycosis are an area of great interest, but little data. Some investigators have suggested a role for adjunctive corticosteroids considering the inflammatory cascade involved in the pathogenesis ARDS (Hough 2014). Anecdotal support has come from case reports and series (Lahm et al. 2008; Plamondon et al. 2010; Azar et al. 2015; Schwartz et al. 2016), although sufficiently powered prospective or retrospective studies are unlikely to be forthcoming (Schwartz et al. 2016).

In vitro susceptibility testing on a small number of human B. dermatitidis isolates suggests fluconazole has less activity than itraconazole (Li et al. 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005). While no trial has compared these head-to-head, small single-arm trials in humans are informative. In a prospective, open-label trial of 48 persons with non-life-threatening, non-CNS blastomycosis, itraconazole (at a dose of 200\u2013400 mg daily, for a mean of 6 months) resulted in 90% success (response with no relapse by 1 year follow-up) (Dismukes et al. 1992). In contrast, a trial of fluconazole at a dose of 400\u2013800 mg daily (for a mean of 8.9 months) in 39 patients with non-life-threatening, non-CNS blastomycosis resulted in successful outcome in 87% (Pappas et al. 1997). Prospective trials are lacking in dogs, but Mazepa et al. (2011) retrospectively compared 36 and 31 dogs treated with fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. The study was not powered to detect a difference in outcomes, but dogs treated with fluconazole required longer courses of therapy than those treated with itraconazole (median 183 vs 138 days, respectively). Nonetheless, costs for fluconazole were much less than for itraconazole, with median costs of $1223 and $3717, respectively (Mazepa et al. 2011). Taken together, this data suggests that fluconazole at higher doses and for longer courses may be reasonable alternatives to itraconazole for blastomycosis in animals.",

            "text": "Quantitative Blastomyces antigen detection by EIA has been evaluated for monitoring of remission in dogs during and after treatment for blastomycosis (Foy et al. 2014). Foy and colleagues prospectively studied 27 dogs with blastomycosis who were monitored clinically, radiographically , and with detection and quantification of Blastomyces antigen in urine and serum following discontinuation of antifungal therapy; among these, 12 dogs were also monitored from time of therapy initiation (Foy et al. 2014). The investigators found that urine antigen levels dropped dramatically within several months of initiation of antifungal therapy. Seven of 27 dogs (26%) relapsed at a median of 4 months following treatment discontinuation. Five of these had detectable antigenuria at the time of clinical relapse, but only one had rising levels of antigenuria preceding clinically detectable relapse. Moreover, persistence of positive urinary antigen at treatment discontinuation did not predict relapse: only two of seven dogs that relapsed had detectable antigenuria at that treatment discontinuation. On the other hand, five of eight of dogs with antigenuria at the end of therapy did not relapse (Foy et al. 2014). In summary, monitoring urine antigen levels during and/or after discontinuation of therapy is unlikely to add significant value to serial clinical and radiographic evaluations for most dogs with blastomycosis.",

This vaccine has been demonstrated to be protective against experimental blastomycosis in mice (W\u00fcthrich et al. 2000), although efficacy in dogs has not yet been established. Experimental infection and a field study of beagles and foxhounds, respectively, demonstrated acceptable safety and immunogenicity (W\u00fcthrich et al. 2011). Adverse reactions included fever, lymphadenopathy, and draining cutaneous lesions at the site of inoculation (W\u00fcthrich et al. 2011); these may limit use in all but highly enzootic regions.",
