Delay in treatment for some acute venous 6 problems has also caused patients to receive suboptimal therapy(3).",

Previously, articles from individual institutions and 11 countries provided their own prioritization scheme, but it was often based on the impact of the 12 covid virus on their own hospital or region of their country and did not apply throughout the 13 world. Sometimes these recommendations conflicted with other hospital systems that were more 14 or less affected by the covid crisis. 15 What makes this document unique is that it has incorporated the recommendations of venous 16 experts from throughout the world and the American Venous Forum joined the international 17 panel. They used an iterative process to come to consensus on the most common venous 18 diseases, whether acute or chronic, upper extremity, lower extremity, or cavitary, in the 19 superficial or deep venous systems.",

For example, some urgent and semi urgent venous diseases might be 22 more aggressively treated at hospitals that have had little COVID-19 impact, with intensive care 23 unit beds, operating rooms, and angio suites available, while institutions overwhelmed with 24 COVID-19 patients may need to limit treatment to approaches that do not take resources away 25 from infected patients. Weighing the relative importance of patients with acute and chronic 26 venous disease care vs. COVID-19 patients is a challenge, but it is made much more systematic 27 by using this document for guidance.28 Congratulations to Drs. Parsi, van Rij, and Meissner, the original authors of the 29 recommendations, as well as the coeditors and co-authors who reviewed the recommendations, 30 provided feedback, and suggested modifications. They have produced a document that the whole 31 world can use when prioritizing the treatment of acute and chronic venous diseases while this 32 COVID-19 crisis is still present. Even after the covid crisis has subsided, this document will 33 remain useful in prioritizing venous and lymphatic care in any crisis, whether from flood or 34 hurricane, war or terrorism-whenever resources are limited. Since unique manifestations of 35 acute venous disease have been identified during the covid crisis, the authors are encouraged to 36 update the document as new information on the prevention and management of venous diseases 37 related to the covid virus are reported.",
