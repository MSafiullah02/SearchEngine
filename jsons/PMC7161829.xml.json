One of the shortcomings of the these two algorithms is that they are lazy learners, that is, they do not learn anything from the training data but simply use the training data itself for prediction because of which they are not robust for predicting noisy data.55 Due to this reason SVM and RF performed better than these MLTs in our study.",

It has been found by earlier researchers that a given class of peptides follow a certain pattern as is the case with antimicrobial peptide prediction algorithms like APD2,48 CAMP,47 AntiBP2,49 ClassAMP,56 AMPA,57 and so forth. To further address this issue, we have used LOVOCV strategy37 in which AVPs from each virus are iteratively excluded and the classifier is trained on AVPs of the remaining viruses followed by testing on the excluded AVPs. This approach worked for 38 out of 42 viruses. Predictive performance for IC50 of each virus was satisfactory for most of the viruses despite the fact that their data was not included during training. It shows that AVP\u2010IC50Pred can act as a general AVP prediction algorithm, which may be applied to other viruses as well. However, there are a few exceptions like HIV, RSV, INFV A and HSV for which algorithm did not work. It can be due to the fact that some viruses differ in their manner of infection/life cycle and hence mechanism or mode of action of AVPs may differ in some cases. Therefore we have provided virus specific models for the above viruses and also integrated them on the web server. In the future, we are interested in making target specific algorithms once appropriate and enough data are available.",

So the PCC of 0.66 in regression mode is reasonable. This performance can be improved further if a large homogeneous dataset is available in future. However, to put more confidence in our present prediction, we used three more MLTs in addition to SVM namely, RF, IBk and K* which performed in a similar fashion.

Also it was shown that mutation of four C\u2010terminal amino acids (WNWF to ANAA) of the enfuvirtide peptide made it inactive.60 Dwyer et al.61 found that the mutations, which increased peptide helical structure, were more effective in blocking the virus.
