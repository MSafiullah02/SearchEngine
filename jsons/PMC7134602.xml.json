In animal experiments the rules of the 3 R's: Reduction, Refinement and Replacement (Russell and Burch, 1959), should be implemented in planning and performing experiments (Flecknell, 2002). Much focus has been put on standardizing environmental factors known to cause unintended variations of the experiments. Some of the parameters that are known to affect results are temperature, air changes, air humidity, light\u2013dark cycles, microbiological conditions (Poole et al., 1987). The current investigation, demonstrate how such a study can be performed, when it becomes necessary to perform experiments involving several variables and groups.",

            "text": "The transcapillary fluid filtration is created by the imbalance between the osmotic and the hydrostatic pressures over the microcirculatory wall, giving a net filtration pressure of 0.5\u20131 mmHg in peripheral tissues as skin and skeletal muscle (Aukland and Reed, 1993; Wiig et al., 1981). The lowering of P\nif will increase the transmural driving pressure during the initial phase of an inflammatory challenge. The lowering of P\nif measured in tracheal tissue of rats following an inflammatory challenge ranges from \u22124 to \u221210 mmHg (Gjerde et al (1997), Gjerde et al (1998), Gjerde et al (2000); Koller and Reed, 1992; Wei et al., 1998; Woie et al., 1993; Woie and Reed, 1997; Woie and Reed, 1994; Woie and Reed, 1996a; Woie et al., 1996). Under normal (non-inflammatory) conditions P\nif is slightly subatmospheric and the mean average and standard deviation measured over 60 or 90 min registration period for trachea is \u22121.45 \u00b1 0.36 mmHg. This average is taken from a total of 13 studies and 17 series of experiments containing all together 132 control animals giving a average of 7\u20138 animals per series (Gjerde et al (1997), Gjerde et al (1998), Gjerde et al (2000), Gjerde et al (2002), Gjerde et al (2003); Koller and Reed, 1992; Koller et al., 1993; Wei et al., 1998; Woie et al (1993), Woie et al (1996); Woie and Reed (1994), Woie and Reed (1996), Woie and Reed (1997)). Figures from previous studies (Koller et al., 1993; Gjerde et al., 2002) illustrate that the levels of P\nif in vehicle treated animals are constant throughout the 60 min recording period. The slightly negative P\nif is one of the forces controlling the filtration over the microcirculatory wall into the interstitium and also acts as a filling pressure for the initial lymphatics (Aukland and Reed, 1993; Levick, 1991). For all previous studies on changes in P\nif in rat trachea, female Wistar rats were used, mainly provided from M&B AS (P.O Box 39, DK-8680, Ry, Denmark) and with a very few exceptions delivered by Harlan UK Ltd (Shaw's Farm, Blackthorn, Bicester, Oxon, OX6 0TP, England). These animals were, over the years, first fed with SDS (Special Diets Services, UK), RM1 Maintenance Diet and later, due to changes in the diet routine in the animal facility, the animals were fed with B&K (B&K universal UK) Rodent Low Protein Diet. Over a period of several months we began to observe variable values and quality in the control measurements of P\nif with values considerably more negative, i.e. with values similar to those observed in inflammation.",

Several environmental factors were improved such as reducing stress by taking special care in the animal handling before and during the experiments. We also improved the conditions at the animal facility by isolating the animals in separate rooms or by placing them in a ventilated cupboard as well as changing the time of the acclimatization period after transport. The conditions with normal P\nif, i.e. the control measurements of P\nif were only partially restored, but with little consistency and with no clear preferences towards any environmental factor. McDonald and collaborators (McDonald (1992), McDonald (1988)) have demonstrated that animals infected with Mycoplasma pulmonis had increased response to neurogenic inflammation. Our animals were delivered by a supplier with regular health monitoring programs and tested negative for mycoplasma as did the sentinels from our animal facility during the actual time period. Also animals were kept in isolators to avoid infection after arrival to the animal facility.",

Measurements of P\nif were initiated soon thereafter on the abluminal portion of trachea and between the cartilage rings using sharpened glass capillaries (4\u201310 \u03bcm) connected to a servocontrolled counterpressure system (Wiederhielm et al., 1964; Wiig et al., 1981) and continued until 60 min after circulatory arrest. The glass pipettes were filled with 0.5 M NaCl colored with Evans blue. Micropuncture was performed under visual guidance with a microscope (Wild M3C, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and care was taken to minimize stretch or compression at the site of puncture (Wiig et al., 1981). The measurements were accepted when the following criteria were met: (1) No change in recorded pressure when increasing feedback gain; (2) Suction applied by the servocontrolled pump should increase electrical resistance in the pipette, verifying open communication to interstitial fluid because of the lower tonicity of the fluid entering the pipette; (3) The baseline measurements before and after P\nif registration were unchanged. The latter measurement was performed in a plastic cup filled with saline placed at the level of the site of puncture. All surgical manipulations on or near the trachea were performed after circulatory arrest to avoid local inflammation that may increase interstitial fluid volume and confound accurate estimates of P\nif .",

They are homozygous at more than 99% of the loci (Festing, 1979; Poole et al., 1987). The genetic status of an inbred strain will stay constant over time, like an immortal clone of identical individuals and changes only occur by mutations. An outbred stock like the Wistar rat, is obtained by breeding a closed colony of genetically undefined animals for at least 4 generations. The genetics of an outbred stock might change over time due to genetic drift as a result of random mating within the population. The use of inbred strains gives a larger statistic precision by use of fewer animals. However, they are more sensitive to environmental influences than outbred stocks. The overall choice was to use several different inbred strains. This will increase the generality of the experiment and still have the same genetic material over time. The rationale for using the outbred Wistar is that it has been used for a long time in similar experiments.",

Although inbred animals are more sensitive than outbred to changes in the environment (Festing, 1979) the combined effect of strain in the total experiment is not significant since the two repeated experiments gave opposite ranking of the strain mean values. The Strain\u00d7Week interaction is actually a study of a genotype\u2013environment interaction. The tendency in these experiment is that BN rats show the highest degree of consistency in the experiments between Week, while the outbred Wistar rats give slightly less consistent results than F344, i.e. BN\u2aa2F344>Wistar. This may suggest that the variation in the response in Wistar rats was due to the genetic heterogeneity of this stock, since two batches of Wistar rats are genetically different.",
