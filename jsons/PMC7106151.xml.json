Although the affected animals rarely die, coronavirus infection causes dramatic reductions in milk production in dairy herds and loss of body condition in both calves and adults (Saif et al., 1998), resulting in severe economic losses. Thus, BCoV is currently considered an important pathogen that causes enteric disease, often in combination with clinical respiratory signs.",

The BCoV genome consists of a single molecule of linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of 31 kb in length that is transcribed into a nested set of several 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that produce both non-structural and structural proteins (Chouljenko et al., 2001). The virion contains five structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein, the small envelope (E) protein, the haemagglutinin\u2013esterase (HE) protein and the spike (S) protein (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997).",

The S1 is the globular subunit and is responsible for virus binding to host\u2013cell receptors (Kubo et al., 1994), the induction of neutralising antibody expression (Yoo and Deregt, 2001) and haemagglutinin activity (Schultze et al., 1991). It\u2019s sequences are variable, and mutations in this region have been associated with changes in antigenicity and viral pathogenicity (Ballesteros et al., 1997). On the other hand, the S2 is the transmembrane subunit and is required to mediate the fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Luo and Weiss, 1998).",

At the end of each run, the convergence of the chains was inspected through the average standard deviation of split frequencies and the first 15% of the trees were discarded. After burn-in, the convergence was again assessed based on the effective sampling size (ESS) using Tracer software version 1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).

The immuno-reactive domains S1A and S1B were outlined in red and blue, respectively; the transmembrane region was outlined in black. The particular signatures linked either with a respiratory (blue arrow) or enteric (red arrow) tropism and virulence factors (black arrow) were also indicated. The potential N-glycosylation sites were marked with black triangles.
