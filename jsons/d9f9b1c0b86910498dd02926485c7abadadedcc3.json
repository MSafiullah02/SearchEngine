[7] On March 13, the Executive Office of the United States proclaimed the pandemic a national emergency. [8] While the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, healthcare systems are rapidly preparing and adapting to increasing clinical demands. [9] [10] Inherent to the operational management of a pandemic in the era of modern medicine is leveraging the capabilities of the electronic health record (EHR), which can be useful for developing tools to support standard management of patients. [11] Technologybased tools can effectively support institutions during a pandemic by facilitating the immediate widespread distribution of information, tracking transmission in real-time, creating virtual venues for meetings and day-to-day operations, and, perhaps most importantly, offering telemedicine visits for patients. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, attention was brought to the use of the EHR as a potential public health tool. [17] Unfortunately, despite the recent Ebola epidemic, the infrastructure for outbreak management was not present in many United States health systems and their EHR applications. [18] As we are now facing a pandemic, many institutions are working to rapidly develop supportive and reliable informatics infrastructure in order to prepare for managing an exponential increase in COVID-19-infected patients. However, the literature to describe the informatics tools required to successfully manage this novel infection is lacking.",

UCSDH utilizes a commercially available, electronic health record (EHR), Epic (Verona, WI), and also hosts over 300 affiliate physicians across 10 medical groups on this EHR. San Diego County served as a quarantine site for both Chinese ex-patriots and cruise ship passengers, and also experienced community spread of COVID earlier than much of the US.

An assessment of the institutional current state revealed the need to develop a rapid screening process, hospital-based and ambulatory testing, new orders with clinical decision support, reporting/analytics tools, and the enhancement/expansion of current patient-facing technology.",

In Taiwan, a national health insurance database was integrated with immigration and customs data to generate real-time alerts during clinic visits to aid in case identification. [29] Online questionnaires were utilized to risk stratify travelers so that low risk citizens were automatically sent a health declaration border pass while high-risk individuals were quarantined at home and remotely monitored for the development of symptoms with mobile device applications. [29] Healthcare systems in Houston, Texas, developed remote communication channels between physicians and emergency responders to assist with triaging. [14] Virtual home visits for high risk individuals and remote ICU monitoring is also being employed to reduce hospital-staff contact with patients with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. [14] Multiple institutions across the United States have transitioned to telemedicine in an effort to reduce emergency room visits through remote triaging. [23] Telemedicine has already proved useful during epidemiological emergencies, including through use of live video counseling with patients, virtual patient monitoring, and mobile applications for symptom observation. [15] Telemedicine can be used in the setting of emergency medicine to triage patients, decrease the rate of discharge without complete treatment and proper follow-up, and reduce the number of in-person visits and subsequent risk of transmission of infection. [12] [13] An additional application is in early symptom identification and triaging as a mitigation strategy for potential delays in access to healthcare. [30] This was previously observed in Wuhan, China during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 when 89% of patients were not hospitalized until at least 5 days into their illness. [30] Enhancing existing EHR platforms with tools for triaging and screening for symptoms has the potential to identify symptomatic patients earlier and decrease the physical burden on healthcare systems.

The usual EHR enhancement project includes a thorough clinical and technical scoping process, a budgeting and planning stage, project management oversight, careful design with testing in multiple electronic environments, ample communication to end-users prior to go-live, and finally implementation with field support in active clinical settings. Due to obvious time constraints, we were unable to follow this standard workflow. The result was an end-product that required back and forth communication with front-line care providers, ongoing iterations, and unanticipated incidents and disruptions to daily practice. Education and training were difficult as providers dealt with a litany of internal and external communication streams in addition to managing an already full clinical workload. A surge in requests from clinical departments to start utilizing video visits placed a strain on the limited bandwidth of the informatics department and the EHR optimization team necessitating the development of a prioritization and onboarding process.
