Some investigators have reported that RV\u2010C caused more serious illness, especially wheezing and exacerbation of asthma, in some populations5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 compared with illnesses caused by RV\u2010A and B.

The aim of our study is to identify the RV species and types causing respiratory symptoms in a unique population of young infants in rural, southern Nepal. A secondary aim is to determine if there are relationships between RV species and types in demographics and illness severity in these very young infants in Nepal.",

Sanger sequencing was performed by GENEWIZ (Seattle, WA), which uses a Quality Score to assess sequence quality, similar to a Phred score, that is the average of the quality values (QVs) for each base in the sequence. To analyze the sequence, we used a QV cutoff of 30 when manually assessing the chromatogram quality, which equals a 0.001 error (or 1/1000) of probability in base calls. Sequences were compared with RV sequences in the NCBI GenBank database using BLAST to identify the RV type with greater than 90% identity. Sequences that did not match a known RV type in GenBank with at least 90% identity were identified as the RV species and the designation U (unknown type).

Others were detected repeatedly in multiple infants, occurring during a short time span or over the entire study period. Our findings confirm those of other investigators who examined RV types detected in samples from different populations in diverse settings and geographical locations.5, 9, 12, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 The proportions of RV species and the high genetic diversity that we detected are similar to what many other studies have found, with RV\u2010A being detected most frequently and RV\u2010B being detected most infrequently. The majority of studies conducted in many parts of the world have consistently reported that RV\u2010A, B, and C are detected in 48% to 65%, 2% to 12%, and 26% to 44% of samples, respectively.4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35 Our study is unique to many other studies in that we assessed viral types in a community\u2010based rural setting, using prospective surveillance, compared with the clinic or hospital\u2010based surveillance in more urban settings. Nonetheless, this study, in agreement with previous studies, has found high genetic diversity and rapid turnover of types, with few types being detected in consecutive seasons or over long periods of time. This simultaneous and successive circulation of different RV types may be one reason for the high incidence of RV infections throughout the year.28\n",

LRT symptoms were more frequently reported in younger infants (<90 days old) compared with older infants (90\u2010180 days old). We examined the association of RV species and types with age at infection, PCR C\nt value, and reported respiratory symptoms. RV species was not associated with age or PCR C\nt value, a surrogate for viral load. However, we tested infants only from birth to 6 months of age and were only able to sequence RV\u2010positive samples with C\nt values less than 30. We did not observe any associations between RV species A and C and clinical signs or symptoms, pneumonia, or care\u2010seeking in these infants. We previously did not observe an association between RV species in RV\u2010positive febrile pregnant women in the Nepal study and low birth weight in their infants.37 No associations between RV species and illness severity have been reported by others.4, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 30, 38 However, some studies have shown that RV\u2010C species are more likely to cause LRT illnesses than RV\u2010A5, 9 including specific clinical findings, such as wheezing,12, 39 asthma,31 rhonchi, vomiting,13 and viremia.26 The discrepancies between these studies may be due to the patients that were tested. The majority of studies that showed an association between RV\u2010C and more severe illnesses were conducted in children with LRT symptoms.",

The number of viral copies in these samples was too low to provide adequate sequencing data. If some RV types are more likely to be present in low viral loads, their prevalence would be underestimated by our sequencing method. Also, we relied on symptoms reported by parents at weekly interviews and some episodes could have been missed due to limited recall. A total of 25 infants had multiple RV illnesses, in which different RV types were detected. However, we may have missed sequential infections caused by different RV types during single illness episodes because we defined an episode as having more than 21 days between RV\u2010positive nasal swabs and we sequenced only one sample per illness episode. Consequently, for illnesses with symptoms and RV\u2010positive swabs over a long period of time, we were not able to distinguish between prolonged shedding of a single RV type and possible infection with a new type. because we did not test asymptomatic infants, RV types circulating during the study period in asymptomatic infants would also have been underestimated.",
