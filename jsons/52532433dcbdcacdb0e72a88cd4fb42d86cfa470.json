It was reported 66 fatal cases as of March 12, 2020, and the time taken from experiencing symptoms to confirming is about 4.5 days and the time taken from test to confirming is about 0.5 days (Jeong et al. 2020 ). So, we used 1/ = 3(days) while assuming the presumed self-isolation to be approximately one day. The period from being isolated to discharged was taken to be 14.7 days from the data reported until March 13, 2020 from KCDC (Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare 2020). So, we used 1/ = 14.7 + 1.5 = 16.2(days) that was collaborated with our assumption. Transmission rate 0 , 1 , case fatality rate , and decay rate were estimated.",

The first patient was reported on January 20, 2020, but the transmission of the infection actually started from the 3rd confirmed patients from January 22 in Korea. Since then, the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea has resulted in 29 confirmed cases by February 18. In addition, it appeared that the outbreak was going to be controlled. It was shown that 0 = 1.77 in our model analysis. This is slightly lower than that of Wuhan, China ( 0 = 2.24~3.58) (Zhao et al. 2020) . Personal hygiene, such as wearing masks, handwashing and disinfecting items, seemed to have been maintained a certain level, Thus far, the COVID-19 outbreak is ongoing in many countries. For example, as of March 23, 2020, countries such as Italy, the United States, Spain, Germany, and France still have more than 3,000 confirmed cases per day and more than 100 deaths per day. However, in Korea, the outbreak has been reduced, as confirmed by the value of to less than unity within 10 days after the first mass infection was noticed. Accordingly, we suggest that the government policy of \"social distancing\" which had been implemented in Korea until April 5 and extended to May 5 may be maintained even at a lower level. ",

Therefore, although our study provides a result of < 1 since February 28, we are not sure what uncertainty such as another mass infection and passive preventive action, can be expected. As suggested in our study, an outbreak more severe than the current level may occur if there is another mass infection in future. Also, second big wave of outbreak may occur again caused by migrant although it seemed to have controlled as in Singapore case (A Singapore GovernmentAgency 2020). Even if the outbreak seems to have controlled in Korea, reemergence might be occurred at any time when it is prevalent worldwide.
