Among all the analyzed CT abnormalities, it was interesting to note that the presence of the air bronchogram was identified in few studies, resulting in percentages up to 80% with an interval between 8% to 80%. Heterogeneous results were found in works describing the crazy-paving pattern, which showed very large values ranging from 5% to 75% and interstitial thickening or reticulation pattern with ranging from 17.5% to 81.8%. A further result showing diversified values was pleural involvement with values ranging from 8.4% to 56.5%. Of note, the reversed halo sign was described in only three studies: Bernheim et al. found it in 2% [10], Yan Li et al. in 3.9% [12], Harrison X. Bai in 5% [20].

At present, Italy is the second most affected SARS-CoV-2 country in the world with 35713 total confirmed cases up to 19 March 2020 [33]. In a setting of high clinical suspicion, due to typical clinical symptoms and previous exposure to other individuals with SARS-CoV-2, a combination of chest imaging elements and repeat laboratory RT-PCR may help to increase the COVID-19 diagnosis. For this reason, it is of crucial importance to define imaging patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in order to promptly diagnose the viral infection in acute stages and to lead to the correct work-up. We retrospectively evaluated multi-modality imaging hallmarks of 36 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, during the early phases of the disease.",

Our findings were consistent with the collected data described in recent studies. Regarding lesions distribution, we confirmed the bilateral and multifocal lung involvement, concordant with data of previous works. In six cases we found lymphadenopathy and in three cases pleural effusion considered uncommon findings based on recent literature. Furthermore, we noted the presence of perilesional vascular thickening in ten patients (23.8%), representing a peculiar CT manifestation of COVID-19; this sign was observed in the studies of Yan Li 82.4% [12], Zhao 71.3% [8] and Zhou 45.2% [9], and it has been correlated to the hyperemia induced by an acute inflammatory response, expression of temporal changes.",

In details, in the ultra-early stage, CT elements may be single or multiple focal GGO, nodules enclosed by GGO, patchy consolidations, and air-bronchogram signs; the early stage is characterized by multiple GGO, patchy consolidations, or a combination of GGO and interlobular septal thickening expression of increased interlobular interstitial edema, alveolar capillary congestion and exudate fluid in alveolar sac [34]. During the rapid progression, there is a worsening of the inflammatory damage corresponding to CT features such as large consolidative opacities and contextual air bronchograms; these findings gradually may decrease in size and density during the consolidation stage. Finally, in the dissipation stage, lesions may be reduced of number and extension, with remaining small ill-defined consolidative opacities, reticular opacities and interlobular septal thickening [34].",

Furthermore, among the associated COVID-19 pneumonia signs, the reversed halo-sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign observed in recent studies [9,10] were not described in the literature regarding SARS and MERS. In addition, the described chest CT appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia of bilateral peripheral GGO could resemble other processes such as influenza pneumonia and organizing pneumonia, either idiopathic or secondary to drug toxicity and connective tissue disease [20,37].",
