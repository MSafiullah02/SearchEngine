            "text": "Worldwide, the potential for emerging infectious diseases is a major global health issue. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia in April 2012 (Al\u2010Tawfiq, Omrani, & Memish, 2016). Camels are considered as a carrier for MERS\u2010CoV transmission in humans. The possible transmission modes are droplet and contact spread (Bhatia, Sethi, Gupta, & Biyani, 2016). The 2015 MERS\u2010CoV epidemic in South Korea has been the largest outbreak of MERS outside Middle East. The first person (index patient) with MERS\u2010CoV in Korea was a 68\u2010year\u2010old man who had returned from the Middle East. This patient visited 3 different medical clinics for the initial symptoms until he was diagnosed with MERS on May 20, 2015, which was 9 days after his first visit (Lee & Ki, 2015; Yang et al., 2015). A MERS outbreak in Korea was caused by hospital\u2010to\u2010hospital transmission because patients were moved to other hospitals without appropriate quarantine (Ki, 2015; Kim et al., 2016). It was exacerbated by overcrowding in the emergency room, delayed diagnosis, and lack of self\u2010protection (Balkhy, Perl, & Arabi, 2016; Xia, Zhang, Xue, Sun, & Jin, 2015).",

Additionally, for the temporary screening of MERS\u2010suspected cases, triage was set up to screen the infected or suspicious patients and to block the cross\u2010transmission in and outside hospitals. Furthermore, the government adopted the National Safe Hospital Program to control MERS infections within hospitals (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). As part of this program, patients with respiratory disease saw clinicians in secured areas instead of outpatient clinics or emergency rooms, used a separate room in case of hospitalization, and were tested for MERS\u2010CoV before being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) to minimize the transmission of the virus. During MERS outbreaks, 186 Koreans had been exposed to MERS in hospitals as of July 15, 2015. Both patients and health care personnel (doctors, nurses, and emergency medical transporters) were confirmed with a MERS\u2010CoV infection across 16 hospitals, and 36 deaths were reported (Balkhy et al., 2016; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015; Yang et al., 2015).",

Nurses also reported positive experiences of becoming more confident, mature, and broad\u2010minded while caring for SARS patients (Liu & Liehr, 2009) and positive feelings about their experience of caring for H1N1 patients (Honey & Wang, 2013).

Participants said that the presence of fever was checked at the hospital entrance for all visitors and staff using fever detectors installed at the gate of the hospitals. Additionally, they had to inquire about whether patients had recently taken a trip to the Middle East or had visited a hospital that had a confirmed case of MERS. Staff who worked outside the hospital building to check visitors' temperatures suffered from the heat of hot summer. Furthermore, participants complained of getting off work late because of increased work and short staffing in their nursing units. They stated that some nurses had to move to work at other units, such as temporary quarantine, hospital entrance gates, or airborne isolation rooms. In addition, some nurses were reverse isolated at their home because of the possibility of transmitting the virus to patients. The participants reported experiencing burnout as they faced the deteriorating situation and worked without expecting when this would stop. \u201cIt takes more time for admitting patients because of the need to perform additional history taking and providing education related to MERS, including hand washing and wearing a mask.\u201d",
