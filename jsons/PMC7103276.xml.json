            "text": "The concept developed by Marshall McLuhanin the early 1960s on considering planet Earth as becoming a Global Village (http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm) has proved to be true fifty years afterwards. Humankind has become global, indeed, not only virtually but physically as well: in addition to the World Wide Web, economical, commercial, and touristic activities have led to unquestionable benefits for the exchange of cultures, but it has also imposed a heavy burden on the rest of the biosphere. A huge part of it is formed by the microbial world, so that going global has increased health risks in the way of outbreaks of epidemics, and the appearance of new transmissible diseases: the swine and avian flu, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, to name the most known (see, for instance, the reports by the US-Center for Disease Prevention and Control: http://www.bt.cdc.gov/publications, and its European counterpart: http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/Pages/home.aspx). Within this global scenario, not only viruses but also bacterial plasmids have increased their relevance as vehicles to disseminate genetic information among different species: the human activities and human contacts have resulted to be brutal selection processes that have accelerated the horizontal transfer of genetic information among microorganisms (Baquero, 2004, Wellington et al., 2013). Selection of novel bacterial traits derives not only from the need of better starters for fermentation/food production but also from the abuse and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. These last activities have led to the selection of bacteria harboring genetic elements with multiple antibiotic-resistances (AbR), which are rapidly spread (even as epidemic outbursts in hospitals) by horizontal gene transfer, HGT (Anderson and Seifert, 2011, Baquero, 2009). Genes responsible for AbR frequently cluster in the bacterial mobile elements (the mobilome) within the Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) and transmissible plasmids that, in turn, are platforms to recruit various smaller mobile elements, such as insertion sequences, transposons and integrons that can also encode AbR genes (Frost et al., 2005). Thus, HGT mediated by self-replicating plasmids or by transfer of the islands, plays an essential role in the bacterial, and consequently in the global biodiversity.",

Those processes involve the two main ways of inheritance, namely vertical (VGT, from mother to daughter cells) and HGT (cell-to-cell) gene transfer (Thomas, 2000). Whereas the former includes DNA replication and partition, this latter being coupled to the cell division, HGT is usually achieved by conjugation between cells of the same or different species (del Solar et al., 1998, Grohmann et al., 2003, Lanka and Wilkins, 1995). Replication and conjugation are, in addition to genetic recombination, the most important sources of genetic variability among plasmids and their hosts. The entire genetic content of the bacterial mobilome amounts up to 25% of the total DNA circulating among bacteria, thus being a shared strong task force for the evolution of the bacterial populations (Ochman et al., 2000, Thomas and Nielsen, 2005). A substantial part of the mobilome is constituted by plasmids, the so-called plasmidome (Walker, 2012).",

In addition to their role in the spread of genetic information, bacterial plasmids are excellent models to study a number of biological processes, such as transactions involving macromolecular interactions: protein-DNA, protein\u2013protein, and DNA\u2013RNA (Espinosa, 2013). They also constitute a wealth of information on control of gene expression (del Solar and Espinosa, 2000, del Solar et al., 2002), intracellular distribution of DNA molecules (Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2014), and can be considered as useful models for system biology (Paulson and Ehrenberg, 1998). Excellent books dealing with various aspects of the biology of plasmids have been published (Funnell and Phillips, 2004, Thomas, 2000) and a new one is in press (Alonso and Tomalsky, 2014). In the present review we will concentrate on plasmids replicating by the rolling circle mechanism (RCR-plasmids) because they may encode up to two proteins with endonuclease/topoisomerase-like activity that cleave supercoiled DNA at two different regions on the same molecule, making their study thought-provoking.",

            "text": "Replication and transfer generally require that plasmid-encoded protein(s) interact with their cognate DNA sites to initiate the process. The key initiator players in these two processes are: (i) the generically called Rep proteins involved in vegetative replication and that interact with their cognate origin of replication, oriV, and (ii) the relaxases, usually termed Tra or Mob proteins, involved in transfer, and that recognize their cognate origin of transfer, the oriT. Thus, interplays between Rep-oriV and Tra/Mob-oriT will define the VGT and the HGT processes, respectively. The early discovery of conjugation (Lederberg and Tatum, 1946, Lederberg and Tatum, 1953) and the existence of plasmid-encoded proteins that relax the donor DNA as the first stage in the transfer process, led to a historically broad interest in plasmid transfer among Gram-negative (G\u2212) bacteria. Conjugation in Gram-positive (G+) bacteria was studied relatively later and it is still a matter of active research (Goessweiner-Mohr et al., 2013, Grohmann et al., 2003). Replication involves a number of different strategies devoted to the melting of the DNA strands at the origin of replication (namely theta, strand-displacement and rolling-circle mechanisms), and is usually mediated by the Rep initiator alone or with the help of plasmid- or host-encoded proteins (del Solar et al., 1998). Although DNA melting to initiate the transfer is also required, conjugation, however, involves a single strategy devoted to the unidirectional transfer of mobile elements (plasmids or ICEs) from a donor bacterial cell to a recipient one through physical cell-to-cell contact (de la Cruz et al., 2010, Zechner et al., 2000). Based on their transfer machinery we can distinguish between: (i) self-transmissible (conjugative) plasmids and integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), which codify all the functions required for their HGT, and (ii) mobilizable plasmids and integrative and mobilizable elements (IMEs), which \u2018travel light\u2019 because they encode only the relaxase and its cognate oriT. These latter plasmids and IMEs make use of functions provided by either the host chromosome or by other auxiliary (also termed \u2018helper\u2019) plasmid for their transference.",

            "text": "The assembly of plasmid- and host-encoded proteins in a specific DNA region initiates replication and transfer, thus initiation of both processes requires the generation of multiprotein-DNA-complexes, the replisome or the relaxosome, respectively (del Solar et al., 1998, Lanka and Wilkins, 1995, Pansegrau and Lanka, 1996a). In the case of RCR-plasmids (del Solar et al., 1987, Khan et al., 1981, Novick, 1998, Puyet et al., 1988, te Riele et al., 1986a, te Riele et al., 1986b), initiation of replication and mobilization are mechanistically similar processes. Both, Rep and Tra/Mob proteins have endonuclease/topoisomerase-like activities on their DNA targets, the double-strand origin (dso) or the oriT. These proteins cleave their cognate DNA at the phosphodiester bond of a specific di-nucleotide (the nic site) generating a stable amino acyl-DNA adduct (Chandler et al., 2013, de la Campa et al., 1990, Guasch et al., 2003, Khan, 2003, Koepsel et al., 1986, Moscoso et al., 1997, Pansegrau and Lanka, 1996a). The nick introduced by Rep or Tra/Mob proteins generates a free 3\u2032-OH end, which acts as a primer for leading-strand synthesis in both cases, VGT and HGT. In the RCR-plasmids, proteins from the host replicative machinery, at least DNA-polymerases I and III, single-strand (ss) DNA-binding protein and PcrA helicase, participate in the elongation from the 3\u2032-OH end generated by the plasmid-encoded Rep initiator (Anand et al., 2005, Anand and Khan, 2004, D\u00edaz et al., 1994, Khan, 2003, Khan, 2005, Mach\u00f3n et al., 2010, Ruiz-Mas\u00f3 et al., 2006, Soultanas et al., 1999, Thomas et al., 2013). To process their DNA substrates, initiators of replication and transfer require the nic site being exposed in a single-stranded configuration, which can be achieved by DNA melting and generation of hairpin structures. Hairpin formation would be mediated either by the binding of auxiliary associated proteins, and/or by binding of the initiator or the relaxase. In both cases, the di-nucleotide to be cleaved will be exposed in an unpaired form (Jin and Novick, 2001, Lorenzo-D\u00edaz et al., 2011, Lucas et al., 2010, Noirot et al., 1990, Ruiz-Mas\u00f3 et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Besides the initiator (relaxase) and its binding site (oriT), conjugation requires an additional machinery that RCR does not, namely the protein complex that completes the conjugation apparatus. This is a highly specialized protein machinery encoded by the donor plasmid DNA (or the host chromosome in some cases) that includes the coupling protein (T4CP) and the Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) which translocate the relaxase-DNA complex to the recipient cell (Draper et al., 2005, Garcill\u00e1n-Barcia et al., 2007). T4SSs recruit their substrate by mechanisms still not fully understood for conjugation, and they also participate in other processes involving DNA trafficking between prokaryotic donors and recipient (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) cells, like in the case of Ti and related plasmids (Baron et al., 2002, Bhatty et al., 2013, Cascales et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2005, de Paz et al., 2005, Goessweiner-Mohr et al., 2013, Gomis-Ruth et al., 2004, Hamilton et al., 2000, Llosa et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2012). The T4CP and the T4SS proteins participate in pumping the transferred DNA (T-DNA)-relaxase complex into the recipient cell (Gomis-R\u00fcth and Coll, 2006, Guasch et al., 2003, Llosa et al., 2002, Matilla et al., 2010). In RCR as well as in transfer, the parental DNA strand will be displaced until either the dso or the oriT are reconstituted. This last stage involves DNA strand transfer reactions that will terminate either leading strand replication (in the donor cell) or plasmid transfer (in the recipient cell). Intermediates of both processes will be ssDNA molecules that correspond to the parental plus strand (del Solar et al., 1998, Grohmann et al., 2003, Pansegrau and Lanka, 1996a, Pansegrau and Lanka, 1996b, Wilkins and Lanka, 1993). Synthesis of the lagging strand initiates from the so-called single-strand origins (sso), as described below.",

In the case of small plasmids, isolated primarily from G+ bacteria, two pioneer discoveries were made: (i) the identification of specific single-stranded DNA molecules (ssDNA) as intermediates of plasmid replication (Puyet et al., 1988, te Riele et al., 1986a, te Riele et al., 1986b), and (ii) the finding that their Rep initiator proteins exhibited a sequence-specific relaxing activity on supercoiled DNA (Koepsel et al., 1985). These results led to the discovery of RCR-plasmids, which constituted a new class of plasmids that replicate by the asymmetric rolling circle mechanism that share similarities with the replication of ssDNA coliphages (Novick, 1998). Furthermore, the presence of RCR-plasmids in G\u2212 bacteria (Yasukawa et al., 1991) helped to cast off the idea of a genetic barrier between the two types of bacteria (del Solar et al., 1993). Thus, the conclusion that plasmid RCR is mechanistically similar to conjugative transfer was soon achieved (Waters and Guiney, 1993). It was interesting to learn that some of the RCR-plasmids encoded, in addition to the Rep topoisomerase-like initiator, another protein with the ability to relax DNA (Caryl et al., 2004, Grohmann et al., 2003, Guzm\u00e1n and Espinosa, 1997, Smith and Thomas, 2004). These proteins were thought to be involved in inter-plasmidic recombination (plasmid recombination enzymes, Pre; (Projan and Novick, 1988)), although it was later shown that Pre proteins were required for plasmid mobilization (Priebe and Lacks, 1989). Further, the relaxase activity of the pMV158_Pre protein (renamed MobM) on supercoiled DNA, and its nic site were demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Grohmann et al., 1997, Guzm\u00e1n and Espinosa, 1997). However, even up today, these proteins are grouped into a family termed Mob-Pre at the database of protein families Pfam (PF01076), and no further investigations on their participation in plasmid recombination have been performed.",

This latter kind of origins varies among the different RCR described, but they have been categorized in four types: ssoA, ssoU, ssoW, and ssoT depending on their DNA sequence (Khan, 2000, Khan, 2005, Kramer et al., 1998a, Kramer et al., 1997, Meijer et al., 1995b, van der Lelie et al., 1989), or in their role in plasmid promiscuity (Kramer et al., 1995, Lorenzo-D\u00edaz and Espinosa, 2009). Their structure and roles will be described below (see Table 1\n). RCR-plasmids may harbor all the cassettes, like the streptococcal plasmids pMV158 and pRW35 (Priebe and Lacks, 1989, van der Lelie et al., 1989, Woodbury et al., 2008), or just the LIC cassette, as in the mycoplasma plasmids pADB201 (Bergemann et al., 1989) and pKMK1 (King and Dybvig, 1992), which are considered to be the smallest RCR-plasmids, unless we consider the hybrid phage-plasmid phasyl (Seufert et al., 1988) as one of them.",

The AbR trace could be considered as a thought-provoking approach to follow the RCR-plasmid \u2018fate\u2019 along evolutionary history. Although we have not performed any further search, a homolog of the pMV158-tetL determinant was found in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis (Lacks et al., 1986), whereas a cat gene, homologous to the one harbored by plasmids pC194 and pC221 has been described to be present in the chromosome of G+ bacteria, like Bacillus pumilus (Harwood et al., 1983) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pepper et al., 1988), and even in the chromosome of Clostridium perfringens (Bannam and Rood, 1991). These findings argue in favor of the role of these RCR-plasmids in the integration and dispersion of resistance genes in the chromosome of hosts that they have colonized.",

As mentioned above, RCR-plasmids were grouped in several families, although the most studied are the Rep_1 family (PF01446), whose prototypes are the staphylococcal plasmids pC194, and pUB110, the Rep_2 family (PF01719) of which the streptococcal plasmid pMV158 and the staphylococcal plasmid pE194 are the representatives, and the Rep_trans family (PF02486) represented by the staphylococcal plasmids pT181 and pC221 (del Solar et al., 1998, del Solar et al., 1993, Gruss and Ehrlich, 1989, Khan, 1997, Khan, 2000, Khan, 2005, Novick, 1989). These three families harbor all the cassettes with the exceptions of pC194 that does not contain a MOB module and the lagging-strand origin ssoU, which is reported to be present only in pUB110 and pMV158 (Fig. 1). Curiously, these two latter plasmids also share identical oriT sequences. In vitro, the MobM-protein from pMV158 was able to relax supercoiled DNA from both plasmids (Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2013a). Out of the representatives of the different families, pC194 has been reported to be one of the most promiscuous, since it was shown to replicate not only in staphylococci, streptococci and bacilli (Ballester et al., 1990, Horinouchi and Weisblum, 1982), but also in Escherichia coli and in the yeast Saccharomyces as well (Goursot et al., 1982). In the case of pMV158, it has been shown to exhibit an extraordinary host range. The plasmid was primarily isolated from Streptococcus agalactiae (Burdett, 1980) and, along the years, it has been transferred in the laboratory (either by mobilization or by transformation) to more than 20 bacterial species, from Firmicutes to \u03b1-Proteobacteria and in all of them it replicates stably (del Solar et al., 1998, Espinosa, 2013, Lacks et al., 1986).",

In general, we found a good correlation between the G + C content of RCR-plasmids and their respective hosts (Espinosa et al., 1995), with the exception of the staphylococcal plasmid pUB110 which has a G + C content close to 45%, making it a plasmid which has been considered more like a bacilli than a staphylococci replicon (Alonso et al., 1988, McKenzie et al., 1986).",

Secondly, pMyBK1 is the only example of mobilizable plasmid in genus Mycoplasma, and it is precisely a MOBV plasmid. Inspecting the sequence of the mob gene of pMyBK1, we found that it harbors 39 UGA codons (out of a total of 520 codons). Since in Mycoplasma UGA specifies \u201ctryptophan\u201d instead of \u201cstop\u201d (Halbedel and St\u00fclke, 2007, Inamine et al., 1990, Yamao et al., 1985), we can conclude that the transfer of pMyBK1 would be limited to Mycoplasma species.",

Furthermore, a 6-bp sequence (5\u2032-ACTTTA-3\u2032) is repeated in the IR1/IR3 left-arm and the IR2 right-arm (Fig. 3\n). The nic site was firstly mapped in vitro between coordinates 3595\u20133596 (dinucleotide 5\u2032-GpT-3\u2032) in the pMV158 sequence (GenBank Acc. No. NC_010096; (Guzm\u00e1n and Espinosa, 1997)). Then, the nic sites for the pMV158 and pE194 oriTs were determined in their respective hosts in vivo (Grohmann et al., 1997), mapping exactly in the same position as already suggested by the previous in vitro results. In silico analysis revealed that the IRs could generate three alternative stem-loop structures in which the position of the nic site would be placed in different positions: (i) located 8-bp upstream to IR1, (ii) in the IR2 inter-arm region, or (iii) at the 3\u2032-end of the IR3 (Lorenzo-D\u00edaz et al., 2011). IR3 includes the IR1 sequence and, since IR1/3 and IR2 partially overlap (see Fig. 3), the generation of cruciform secondary structures by one of them would hinder the formation of the other, indicating that the target DNA accessibility by the relaxase could depend on the plasmid DNA superhelicity (Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014). Our in vitro analysis demonstrated that MobM binds specifically to ssDNA encompassing IR1/3 with high affinity (Lorenzo-D\u00edaz et al., 2011), which allowed the MobM protein to repress its own synthesis (Lorenzo-D\u00edaz et al., 2012). Functional relevance of the IRs in the different steps of the conjugative process is currently under exploration. We hypothesize that IR1/3 may be involved in the Mob-recognition of the oriT at the initiation of the relaxosome formation (in the donor cell) and IR2 at the termination reaction to close the T-strand (in the recipient cell).",

Analysis of the region showed a high degree of sequence conservation in the majority of the oriTs, being composed by three IRs and exhibiting the consensus sequence \u2018GTGBG\u2193T\u2019 for the nic site (B denoting a G, C or T following IUPAC code; \u2018\u2193\u2019 being the nic site). Two other minor plasmid groups, represented by pT181 and p1414, grouped in different clusters given their differences respect to the oriT sequence of pMV158 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). However, these two clusters maintain the number and distribution of the IRs. Unfortunately, the experimental evidences for mapping the specific nic site in these plasmids are scarce and only a few oriT predictions, such as for plasmids like pSMQ172 and pPB1, have been published (de las Rivas et al., 2004, Turgeon and Moineau, 2001).",

Such is the case of pXY3 (Zhou et al., 2010) and pCI411 (Coffey et al., 1994) plasmids (not included in Table 1), which only seem to contain an orphan and non-canonical oriT. In fact, the prototype RCR-plasmid pC194, which lacks both a mob gene and a canonical oriT, has been mobilized by using the conjugative transposon Tn916 as a helper (Naglich and Andrews, 1988, Showsh and Andrews, 1999). It is assumed that the relaxase of the helper should be able to recognize a suitable oriT in the \u0394mob plasmid. It is more intriguing the finding that pC194 and \u0394oriT-\u0394mob-derivatives of plasmids pUB110 and pTA1060 were efficiently mobilized by the mating apparatus of ICEBs1, but without the intervention of the ICEBs1 NicK relaxase (Lee et al., 2012). Thus, in this case, the plasmids were not transferred by cross-recognition of an oriT by the relaxase of the helper. They were neither transferred by forming cointegrates with ICEBs1. Unexpectedly, the RCR initiation proteins of the mobilized plasmids were crucial for transfer (Lee et al., 2012). Thus, the strategy we have followed to search for plasmids containing MOBV1 relaxases might underestimate the real population of mobile elements.",

Members of this subfamily showed three conserved motifs: (i) Motif I (HxxR), of yet unknown function; (ii) Motif II (NY(D/E)L), which is the proposed catalytic domain, and (iii) Motif III (HxDE\u2026PHxH), which corresponds to the metal-coordination motif, also known as the 3H motif (Chandler et al., 2013). The MOBV2 family, represented by the Mob protein of the theta-replicating plasmid pBBR1 (Szpirer et al., 2001), exhibited Motifs I and III but lacked Motif II. The three motifs are located in the N-terminal moiety of the MOBV relaxases. This moiety harbors the DNA binding and nicking activities, since a truncated version of MobM, which only contains the first N-terminal 199 residues, retained the relaxase activity on supercoiled DNA (Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2013a, Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2013b, Lorenzo-D\u00edaz et al., 2011). The C-terminal moiety of MobM could be involved in, at least, two functions: (i) protein\u2013protein interactions (dimerization and interactions with the auxiliary plasmid-encoded coupling protein) and (ii) association with the cell membrane, through a proposed coiled-coil region located between residues 400 and the C-terminal end of MobM. Disruption of the alpha helical-rich region by mutations (changes to Pro residues) resulted in failure of MobM-association with membranes; further, the pMV158-derivative harboring these mutations lost its ability to be transferred (de Antonio et al., 2004). There was no indication of a helicase activity in the C-terminal moiety of MobM (our unpublished observations).",

All of them shared the three Motifs described above (Fig. 4\nA). The inferred phylogeny of MOBV1 relaxases, rooted by a MOBV2 relaxase, showed well-supported external clusters of highly related sequences and poorly-supported internal nodes (Fig. 4B). It is a fact that reflects the low overall similarity of the taxa, mainly circumscribed to the three relaxase motifs described (Francia et al., 2004, Garcill\u00e1n-Barcia et al., 2009). The plasmids coding these relaxases are primarily distributed in several genera of Lactobacillales and Bacillales, with a few members out of the phylum Firmicutes. Curiously, the plasmids encoding relaxases comprised in a monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 4B are generally hosted in a single taxonomic order (either Lactobacillales or Bacillales), suggesting less inter-order transfer than expected.",

Eight mating-pair formation (MPF) types have been phylogenetically described (Guglielmini et al., 2011); three of them, MPFFATA, MPFFA and MPFT were able to mobilize MOBV1 plasmids. Specifically, pMV158 was mobilized between G+ bacteria by functions supplied by helper MPFFATA plasmids of the Inc18 family, like pIP501 and pAM\u03b21 (Grohmann et al., 1999, Priebe and Lacks, 1989, van der Lelie et al., 1990), and even to the G\u2212 bacterium E. coli by MPFT plasmids RP4 and R388 but not by MPFF plasmid F (Far\u00edas and Espinosa, 2000). Other elements, such as pC194 and pUB110, were mobilized by auxiliary MPFFA elements such as Tn916 (Lee et al., 2012, Naglich and Andrews, 1988), and MPFFATA plasmids, like pLS20, mobilized pUB110 and pBC16 (Koehler and Thorne, 1987, Selinger et al., 1990).",

MOBV1 relaxases are predominantly linked to RCR initiators of the three different subgroups: Rep_1 (PF01446), Rep_2 (PF01719), and Rep_trans (PF02486). A small fraction of MOBV1 relaxases is linked to a wide variety of theta replication families, of which Rep_3 is the most abundant. Congruently, with the abovementioned taxonomic bias in the abundance of RCR initiators and the MOBV1 relaxase distribution, most relaxases encoded in Rep_2 RCR plasmids grouped separately from those encoded in Rep_1 RCR plasmids (clade Lactobacillales vs. Bacillales in Fig. 6\nand Supplementary Table S2). An example of this bias is found in Enterococci (Lactobacillales), where Rep_1 initiators are commonly found in multireplicon plasmids, and may not be functional, as it is the case for plasmid pAM\u03b11 (Clewell et al., 2014). Nevertheless, a few functional Rep_1 initiators can be also found in the Lactobacillales clade, such as those grouped in the cartooned pSMA23 cluster of Fig. 4B. Curiously, within the pSMA23 group some exceptions also exist: plasmid pCD034-2 encodes a Rep_2 instead of a Rep_1 initiator, an indication of recent recombination events that led to new backbone combinations. Besides, more ancient recombination events could give rise to arrangements present in plasmids of the Bacillales MOBV1 clade, since the highly divergent relaxases included in that group are linked to initiators of the three RCR subgroups (Fig. 6A).",

Besides, 10 out of the 93 plasmids coded more than one relaxase gene. Both facts suggest the frequent arising of plasmid cointegrates. Precisely, it is known the ability of RCR-plasmid encoded relaxases to promote site-specific DNA recombination at oriT rendering plasmid cointegrates during conjugative mobilization, where the host rec system may function to stimulate the recombination process (Gennaro et al., 1987, Novick et al., 1984, Projan and Novick, 1988). Further, it is worth recalling that the staphylococcal plasmid pE194 was able to integrate into the B. subtilis chromosome by a RecA-independent recombination mechanism, and using as little as 6\u201314 bp homologies (Dempsey and Dubnau, 1989). This, in conjunction with the finding of RCR-plasmids integrated into other bigger plasmids (Oskam et al., 1991), raises the question of whether RCR-plasmids that are integrated on IMEs would participate in their replication and mobilization; in fact, we have found a putative initiator of replication of the Rep_1 family within an streptococcal island which also encode a MOBV1 protein (our unpublished observations). Besides, the cross-recognition of heterologous oriTs by MOBV relaxases (Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2013a) could be favored in the multi-relaxase cointegrates, potentiating their spreading.",

            "text": "Rolling circle replication in ssDNA coliphages and in plasmids requires the existence of origins that are involved in lagging strand synthesis (Kornberg and Baker, 1992, Novick, 1998). When RCR-plasmids were discovered (te Riele et al., 1986a, te Riele et al., 1986b), it was apparent that the ssDNA intermediates should harbor signals for the conversion of the ssDNA to plasmid dsDNA. This was first reported for plasmid pT181 (Gruss et al., 1987) and soon afterwards for the pMV158-derivative plasmid pLS1 (del Solar et al., 1987). In these two plasmids, it was shown that their ssoAs were located in non-coding 200\u2013300 base-pair-long regions that have the potential to generate one or several secondary structures on ssDNA. These signals were orientation-dependent (this means that they were functional only when placed in the displaced strand). Deletion of the region encompassing the ssoA led to accumulation of ssDNA intermediates and to plasmid instability, but the plasmids were still able to replicate (del Solar et al., 1987, Dempsey et al., 1995, Gruss et al., 1987, Kramer et al., 1995, Murray et al., 1989, Seegers et al., 1995). This finding led to the hypothesis that alternative, albeit less efficient, ssos could replace the genuine conversion signal (del Solar et al., 1987, Kramer et al., 1998a, Meijer et al., 1995a, Meijer et al., 1995b). Although accumulation of ssDNA intermediates and plasmid unstable inheritance by VGT were thought to be related phenomena (Meijer et al., 1995a, Meijer et al., 1995b), cloning of signals that allowed an efficient ssDNA \u2192 dsDNA conversion, at least in plasmid pLS1, did not lead to stable plasmid inheritance (Hern\u00e1ndez-Arriaga et al., 2000). Apart from ssoA, other three sso types have been described based on sequence similarity and structure analysis (Khan, 1996, Khan, 2000, Kramer et al., 1998a): ssoU (pUB110, pMV158), ssoT (pTA1060, pBAA1), and ssoW (pWV01). A fifth type was described in plasmid pM4 from Lactobacillus plantarum, which exhibited no significant sequence or structural similarity with any of the four classical sso (Yin et al., 2009). Plasmids pMV158 and pRW35 have the unusual feature of harboring two sso, ssoU and ssoA. Out of the two origins, the former has a more complex structure than the latter (Fig. 7\n).",

These two regions acted as efficient signals only in ssDNA configuration (replicative intermediates). In these molecules, the ssoA would adopt a long stem-loop structure where the RSB would be located at the stem and the CS-6 in the loop of the hairpin (Fig. 7). Biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that RSB was recognized as the binding site of the host RNA polymerase (RNAP), thus acting as ssDNA promoter (Kramer et al., 1997). These promoters were shown to generate within paired secondary structures on ssDNA molecules and harbor sequences that are recognized by the host RNAP to initiate lagging strand synthesis (Glucksmann-Kuis et al., 1992, Masai and Arai, 1997). From the ssoA\npMV158 promoter, the RNAP synthesized a short 20 nt-long primer RNA (pRNA) that stopped at the CS-6 sequence, which acted as a transcription terminator (Kramer et al., 1997). The pRNA was processed by DNA polymerase I and was proposed to be elongated by the host DNA polymerase III to finish the lagging DNA strand synthesis (Kramer et al., 1998b).",

This limited number is due to the little overall homology among ssos, even those of the same type. All the reported sso types were found: ssoT (13 plasmids), ssoA (11 plasmids), ssoU (6 plasmids) and ssoW (4 plasmids). Two plasmids (pMV158 and pRW35) contained two ssos (ssoA and ssoU). No new members arose in our search of the new type of sso reported for plasmid pM4 (Zhai et al., 2009). Curiously enough, we have observed that while ssoA and ssoW are generally found downstream and close to the mob gene, the ssoU is always upstream with respect to the oriT sequence. In the case of the ssoT element we have found that it can be located upstream (n\n = 5) or downstream (n\n = 8) of the MOB module.",

From the analysis abovementioned, it seems apparent that highly related plasmids do not always contain the same type of sso, whereas distantly related do. These facts complicate even more the picture of the putative host range a MOBV1 plasmid can reach.

            "text": "RCR-plasmids represent a pool of genetic information that is shared by many bacteria. We have found them in Lactobacillales, Bacillales, Mollicutes, etc. Among the bacteria that host them, we have found several of the most relevant G+ pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. These three bacterial species are important for human health because they: (i) exhibit very high rates of human morbidity and mortality; (ii) are the cause of many health-care associated infections; (iii) have acquired elevated resistance to antibiotics; (iv) play an important role as reservoir of AbR and virulence genes, and (v) carry conjugative or mobilizable broad host-range plasmids, thus contributing to the spread of resistances. Infections caused by the above G+ bacteria represent, in addition to a high economic impact, a threat to hospitals, children, elder population and immuno-compromised people (Jones, 2001). Furthermore, plasmid-encoded genes related not only to AbR but also to replication and/or transfer, are also found within the ICEs. However, and in spite of the relevance of these bacteria, very little is known on the genetics and biochemistry of the transfer functions of the RCR-plasmids studied here with the exception of the streptococcal plasmid pMV158 (reviewed in (Espinosa, 2013, Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014) and the staphylococcal plasmid pC221 (Caryl et al., 2004, Caryl and Thomas, 2006, Smith and Thomas, 2004). And even in these two plasmids there is little, if any, information on the interactions of the relaxases encoded by pMV158 or pC221 with the machinery provided by auxiliary plasmids (Arends et al., 2013, Goessweiner-Mohr et al., 2013, Grohmann et al., 2003).",
