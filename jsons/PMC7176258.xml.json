Seattle had become the initial epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, and UW Medicine was one of many health care organizations called to immediate action to respond. We immediately activated the emergency operations center at the health system and individual hospital levels. Thus far, this emergency operations center structure has worked well to disseminate clear and consistent information, cascade decisions across all health system entities in an organized manner, and escalate concerns from staff and local leadership. In tandem with this internal mobilization, UW Medicine providers and staff worked with public health officials to go to local long-term care facilities (e.g., skilled nursing, rehabilitation, assisted living facilities) to evaluate, test, and transfer patients with COVID-19 to the appropriate acute care hospitals.",

We established dozens of patient care protocols, algorithms, and policy and guidance statements, including workflows to see patients in various clinical settings and decision support for testing criteria and telephone triage. We quickly expanded the capacity of our virtual and telemedicine care teams, developing specific protocols for critical care and immunosuppressed and high-risk patients coming to our health care system for complex procedures. These guidelines were written by multiple care partners across UW Medicine, going quickly through the initial draft, revisions, and approval processes and being posted on a central internal UW Medicine website for immediate use. User feedback and subsequent changes are ongoing, and the website is updated in real time as policy and practice recommendations evolve. In keeping with the core mission of our academic health system being a resource for the community hospitals and health facilities in our county and state (and beyond), we also created a public website to facilitate external access to our guidelines and protocols (see the UW Medicine COVID-19 Resource Site at covid-19.uwmedicine.org).",

Having this test locally available improved our response time; we were able to return test results within 12\u201324 hours. In collaboration with public health authorities (through state and federal labs), this test also significantly increased our regional capacity to test at-risk populations. In early March, the Virology Division lab was able to process dozens of specimens per day, which quickly ramped up to more than 2,000 specimens per day with the addition of high-throughput equipment. Within 2 weeks of offering testing services to the state, 85% of the processed specimens came from outside the UW Medicine health system.",

For example, one of our early challenges was the conflict between the precaution and PPE guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. UW Medicine worked with the Washington State Department of Health, the Northwest Healthcare Response Network, and the Washington State Hospital Association to lead the change to adopt the WHO guidelines using standard, droplet, and contact precautions (i.e., mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves) for the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, while reserving airborne precautions for caring for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation). This change was based on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 indicating that the virus spread predominantly through large respiratory droplets similar to other respiratory viruses and on our desire to match the appropriate level of PPE with the care provided. This decision was critical to ensuring adequate supplies of N95 respirators for use in the care of critically ill patients or those undergoing aerosol-generating procedures.",

We quickly adjusted to better coordinate our supplies, including moving all available PPE from nonclinical spaces (e.g., the School of Medicine research and simulation labs) to the hospitals and clinics. Rapid depletion of PPE forced difficult conversations across the UW Medicine system about the sustainability of current practices and led to PPE conservation strategies, such as limiting the number of individuals entering hospital rooms on rounds, transferring medical students from their clinical rotations, and postponing elective and nonurgent surgeries and procedures if they could be safely delayed without causing patient harm.",

We rolled out a strong visitor restriction policy that was instituted across all UW Medicine clinical sites. This decision was not made lightly, knowing that visitors are an important part of healing and that calming fears and assuring and supporting family members are part of our work. However, our general priority has been to focus on maximizing containment given the active community transmission and severity of COVID-19.",

Early on, residents and fellows were excluded from the care of COVID-19 patients. However, as the number of infected patients exponentially increased, residents and fellows were asked to care for these patients in a phased manner, while maintaining the principles of PPE preservation and minimizing the number of provider exposures to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If our county or state should be asked to provide crisis standards of care,2 residents and fellows may be called upon to provide more independent care of patients, with a greater number of trainees under the supervision of a single faculty member. Our health system leaders are already working with regional and state-wide leaders to determine the appropriate allocation and utilization of scarce resources and clinical services available to our community.",

Our first decision regarding medical students on clinical rotations was to prohibit their participation in the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. That quickly evolved to include any patient whose care required the use of PPE, including in operating rooms (with one exception made for subintern students who were on a surgical rotation as a key part of their career planning). This very restrictive policy was soon followed by a School of Medicine decision to suspend students\u2019 clinical rotations until the end of April, when the policy will be reassessed.",
