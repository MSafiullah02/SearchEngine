Symptoms were relieved by oral common cold medications including Chinese traditional medicine (CTM). She felt discomfort with myalgia on January 25 and tested positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, as detected in a RT\u2010PCR assay with an oropharyngeal swab specimen. The complete blood count (CBC) was within normal ranges, and chest CT scan was negative for any signs of pneumonia. Two additional RT\u2010PCR results (January 31 and February 7) were positive for novel coronavirus nuclear acid and with normal chest CT images on both days. She was admitted to the designated hospital on February 9. During hospitalization, all the CBC and biochemical measurements were in normal ranges, and the chest CT scan on February 15 remained normal. She experienced only mild symptoms such as a sore throat and fatigue, without any signs of pneumonia such as cough and chest tightness. The patient recovered after treatment with antiviral therapy (Arbidol) and supportive care. She was discharged on February 22 after three consecutive negative RT\u2010PCR results.

An immediate chest CT scan at the designated clinic showed normal images. She was self\u2010isolated at home and took some common cold medications, CTM and antipyretics to relieve symptoms. The fever ameliorated but the cough persisted. A week later, a second chest CT scan revealed pneumonia in the left lung (Figure 1A). An oropharyngeal swab specimen was collected and tested negative RT\u2010PCR for the novel coronavirus nucleic acid. Despite treatment with antipyretics, her fever reappeared (39.2\u00b0C). She developed chest tightness, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, nausea, and diarrhea. On February 6, the third chest CT scan showed bilateral multiple ground\u2010glass opacities indicating viral pneumonia (Figure 1B) and she was admitted to the designated hospital immediately. On admission, rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation, lymphocyte count slightly decreased [0.81 \u00d7 109/L, reference range: (1.1 ~ 3.2) \u00d7109/L], and the concentration of serum high\u2010sensitivity C\u2010reactive protein (hsCRP) increased [49.9 mg/L, reference range: (0 ~ 3) mg/L], with leukocyte count and procalcitonin (PCT) concentration within normal ranges. She was treated with antibiotics (moxifloxacin), antiviral drug (Arbidol), methylprednisolone on gradually decreased dosage for six days, and supportive care. The four RT\u2010PCR assays on throat swab specimens for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (February 7, 11, 17 and 25) and other common respiratory pathogens tested negative during hospitalization. On February 29, serological antibodies tests against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were conducted and found positive IgM and positive IgG antibodies, confirming the diagnosis of COVID\u201019. With significant reduction in clinical symptoms and CT manifestations, the patient was discharged on March 1.

Three consecutive RT\u2010PCR assays on oropharyngeal swab specimens were conducted during hospitalization. The results tested positive on February 6 and negative on February 9 and 12. The patient received antiviral drugs including Arbidol and Kaletra (lopinavir and ritonavir tablets) and was discharged on February 13 when chest CT images showed that the bilateral lesions were mostly absorbed. Even though he was asymptomatic, he was readmitted to the hospital two weeks later as he tested positive in a RT\u2010PCR assay for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 using a sample collected from an oropharyngeal swab. During the second hospitalization, the CBC and all biochemical tests were within normal ranges.

A chest CT scan one day prior to admission revealed bilateral scattered patchy opacities (Figure 3A). The patient had an uncertain history of heart disease. She was admitted into the designated hospital on January 20. On admission, she had normal vital signs except for low\u2010grade fever (37.5\u00b0C). Bilateral rales were detected on auscultation. The CBC was normal except for the development of eosinopenia (0 \u00d7 109/L) and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP concentration (39 mm/h and 60.41 mg/L, respectively). PCT, liver and myocardial enzymes, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and renal function were all within normal ranges. No other respiratory pathogens were detected by serological antibodies testing and nucleic acid testing. However, gram\u2010positive cocci and gram\u2010negative bacilli were detected in sputum culture. Broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics were administrated intravenously, together with expectorants and supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula. On January 23, the second chest CT scan revealed bilateral extended ground\u2010glass opacities with scattered consolidation, indicating rapid progression of the disease (Figure 3B). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) immediately the next day. Remarkable abnormalities in the CBC were detected on January 29, including increased neutrophils (10.67 \u00d7 109/L), leukocytes (11.73 \u00d7 109/L), and decreased lymphocytes (0.51 \u00d7 109/L), and on February 4, decreased erythrocytes (2.40 \u00d7 1012/L) and platelets (73 \u00d7 109/L). In addition, there was a significant increase in inflammatory indicators, such as PCT, CRP, and D\u2010dimer. On February 3, the patient suffered respiratory and cardiac failure and was subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Unfortunately, during the operation of ECMO she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and survived by rescue of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). On February 10, bedside bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage were performed, revealing hyperemia in mucous membranes of the trachea and bronchi with bleeding tendency and a large amount of yellow sticky sputum obstructing the entrance of the bilateral main bronchi and some bronchial lumens, which were aspirated completely. The bedside chest X\u2010ray showed progression of the pneumonia, since the bilateral diffuse opacities, so\u2010called \u201cwhite lungs,\u201d with air bronchogram occurred on February 15 (Figure 3C, D and E). Gram\u2010negative bacilli were found in the second sputum culture. Six RT\u2010PCR assays for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 remained positive during hospitalization. The patient was treated with potent broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics combined with antifungal agents, methylprednisolone, repeated erythrocytes transfusions, and supportive care. This severe patient was still hospitalized in the ICU when we obtained her electronic medical record on March 1. We regard this patient as a case suffering from a severe secondary bacterial pneumonia concomitant with COVID\u201019 infection.",

Other therapies included antibiotics (cefoperazone sulbactam and moxifloxacin) for targeting the underlying bacterial infection, antiviral drugs (oseltamivir) and supportive care. His symptoms gradually improved, with absorption of inflammatory exudation on CT images and laboratory indicators back to normal levels. After two consecutive negative RT\u2010PCR results, the patient was discharged on February 9.",

The RT\u2010PCR result on a throat swab specimen for viral nucleic acid was weakly positive. She was admitted to the hospital on January 31 and underwent physical examination without abnormal signs. The CBC analysis was normal, except for the development of eosinopenia (0 \u00d7 109/L). Other laboratory tests showed slightly increased concentration of CRP and SAA (3.67 mg/L and 83.7 mg/L, respectively), with all the rest of biochemical parameters within normal ranges. Chest CT images presented bilateral multiple ground\u2010glass opacities on February 2 (Figure 6A). Two RT\u2010PCR assays for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid tested positive during hospitalization. The patient received various treatments including antiviral drugs (Arbidol and interferon\u2010\u03b1 inhalation), expectorant, methylprednisolone on gradually decreased dosages for five days, and supportive care. The second chest CT scan after a week showed partial absorption of lesions (Figure 6B). The patient's symptoms, including diarrhea, disappeared a few days after treatment. After two consecutive negative results of viral nucleic acid tests, she was discharged on February 20. This case is of high interest as the patient experienced diarrhea in the initial symptoms.",

Apart from the asymptomatic case in our report, several previous case reports have also described the absence of any symptoms in patients with laboratory\u2010confirmed COVID\u201019, and they even retain the ability of disease transmission.\n10\n, \n16\n It is of particular interest to investigate if the asymptomatic cases are caused by the immune system, viral load, or a different attenuated viral strain.\n17\n In these cases, the virus has been detected in the pharyngeal specimens, and it is very unlikely to have a different strain in this epidemic condition. It is possible that the virus did not sufficiently stimulate the innate immune response to develop symptoms of fever and fatigue. In addition, there were no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, suggesting a low\u2010level mucosal irritation. Asymptomatic but infective status has been reported in many viruses, such as respiratory, hepatitis, and diarrhea viruses, as well as in other major human viruses, such as cytomegalovirus or herpes viruses.\n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n In a recent COVID\u201019 study, the viral load in upper respiratory specimens of asymptomatic patients was found in similar levels to that of symptomatic patients, suggesting a similar transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients.\n21\n In a large\u2010scale epidemiological survey of all COVID\u201019 cases through February 11, 2020, reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, including 72,314 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases, 889 (1.2%) asymptomatic cases were noted.\n13\n However, it should be noted that a major fraction of tests were performed in symptomatic individuals. A better epidemiologic picture of asymptomatic carriers is expected to be determined after performing a large serological study for the detection of virus specific\u2010IgG antibodies in an exposed population without any age and comorbidity bias. For now, it is important to consider that some of the individuals infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may not display any symptoms and may become a potential source of infection. Therefore, quarantine measures should also be enforced for those individuals that are asymptomatic and have a history of epidemiological contact.",

Previous large\u2010scale clinical investigations indicated the common gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID\u201019 patients were nausea/vomiting and diarrhea, with a prevalence of 5.0% and 3.8%, respectively.\n9\n Not only can the virus be detected in fecal specimens,\n22\n but also the viral nucleic acid testing on rectal swabs remained positive even after nasopharyngeal testing had become negative.\n23\n These findings demonstrate that the novel coronavirus can exist and induce infections in the digestive system and that the viral shedding from the intestinal tract may be greater and last longer than that from the respiratory tract. Therefore, gastrointestinal symptoms and possible fecal\u2010oral transmission of COVID\u201019 should be taken seriously and warrant further investigation.",

A previous report by Lan et al\n14\n also reported four Chinese patients with COVID\u201019, who met the criteria for hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine, developed positive RT\u2010PCR test results 5 to 13 days later. The following four discharge criteria were issued by the China National Health Commission: (a) no fever for at least 3 days; (b) significant improvement in respiratory symptoms; (c) substantial improvement in chest CT images; and (d) two consecutive negative RT\u2010PCR results of SARS\u2010CoV\u201019 nucleic acid (at least with a 24\u2010hour interval). Despite meeting all of the above criteria, some patients\u2019 RT\u2010PCR results test positive again sometime after discharge. This may be caused by incomplete viral clearance, inappropriate immune response development, incorrect sampling, false\u2010negative, and/or false\u2010positive RT\u2010PCR results. Reinfection is unlikely under the strict quarantine measures which require additional 14\u2010day isolation and medical observation after discharge. It is necessary to isolate patients with recurrent positive RT\u2010PCR results and continue treatment until they meet the discharge criteria again. In a recent study, 25 patients with reoccurrence of RT\u2010PCR results were reported, and the median time from their last negative result to turning positive was 6 days.\n24\n This is the reason why strict quarantine and follow\u2010up of COVID\u201019 patients is of upmost importance.",

The adult patient with chronic urticaria in case 9 was also classified as an ordinary type as well. These and previous results indicate that allergic diseases may not be an aggravating factor of the disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that respiratory virus infections represent risk factors for asthma exacerbation and even have prolonged impact on the development of asthma.\n28\n, \n29\n Given the association between virus infection and asthma,\n30\n it is worth carefully monitoring asthmatic patients in this coronavirus epidemic. However, in pediatric cases, we did not find COVID\u201019 patients with a history of asthma (unpublished data). Maybe a distinct type 2 immune response may contribute to this low prevalence of asthma and allergy patients in COVID\u201019.

If the patient had a decreased lung function caused by a chronic respiratory disease, such as COPD (case 10), or developed complications such as a secondary lung infection (case 6), they were more likely to develop more severe symptoms and need advanced supportive measures including mechanical ventilation, ECMO, and so on. Early diagnosis of secondary infections, such as overlapping bacterial pneumonia, is essential for improved patient care. Bacterial and fungal surveillance of the sputum is necessary if neutrophilic leukocytosis appears with worsening of chest radiology or if CRP suddenly increases in parallel to deterioration of a hospitalized case. A broad\u2010spectrum antibiotic should be added to treatment as patient deterioration due to secondary infection is relatively fast.",
