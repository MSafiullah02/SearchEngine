Health officers contacted individuals with possible exposure to understand the specific circumstances of patient involvement and clarify PPE use. The health officer in consultation with physician leadership then made the final determination of exposure and whether quarantine or isolation was indicated according to the CDC risk assessment matrix. 7 An encounter was defined as a 9-1-1 EMS response to a patient confirmed to have COVID-19. An occupational exposure to COVID-19 was defined as a provider-level encounter with inadequate PPE for the patient contact. In addition to eye protection and gloves, a surgical mask was judged to be sufficient for routine patient encounters. However, an N95 mask was required PPE for aerosol generating procedures. For any physical contact with the patient, a gown was required.",
