According to ESC 2013 criteria, the diagnosis is a clinically suspected myocarditis of uncertain aetiology, since endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was not performed. 2 Virology results of sputum are not sufficient to prove that the clinically suspected myocarditis was associated with coronavirus. In addition, cardiotropic viruses that are known to be associated with myocarditis were not investigated (enterovirus, often associated with diarrhoea; or parvovirus B-19, often associated with pseudo-infarct presentation). ii. The authors' assumption that the clinically suspected myocarditis is due to COVID-19 is unlikely to be correct for the following reasons. a. Out of >180 000 known COVID-19 patients, the scenario of clinically suspected myocarditis is uncommon. Chen 3 reported that among the 120 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients included in their study, elevated NT-proBNP (n = 33; 27.5%) and cTnI (n = 12; 10%) levels were recorded, yet it remains uncertain whether these patients had additional cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, multi-organ failure, or ARDS, which may per se explain increased NT-proBNP and troponin without postulating the occurrence of myocarditis. Thus, current epidemiological data do not support the hypothesis that myocarditis is associated with COVID-19, or that it is common.",

Transient unspecific myocardial injury and dysfunction during the hyperinflammatory state and cytokine storm? Immune-mediated?). Moreover, it was treated with an empirical 4-day course of methylprednisolone, which might in fact be detrimental both for COVID pneumonia 4 and the clinically suspected COVID-associated myocarditis, 2 and with IVIG that was neutral or useless for a hypothetical COVID myocarditis because IVIG do not contain IgG to COVID (normal blood donors, as the whole of the world's population are at present lacking a specific IgG response, except for recovered COVID patients). The favourable evolution seen in this case might simply reflect the curative strength of nature in a random association of COVID infection and clinically suspected acute myocarditis of undefined aetiology; up to 50% of acute myocarditis cases undergo spontaneous healing. 2 Conflict of interest: none declared.",
