Its efficacy is not clear and it may have been used to manage influenza coinfection. Its use is not recommended at present.\u2022Inhaled interferon-alfa has been recommended in combination with antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir in adults, and a clinical trial has been set up to assess its efficacy. Interferon-alfa has broad-spectrum antiviral effects and is used to treat hepatitis B virus. Formulations of this drug for inhalation are not currently available in Spain. Chinese guidelines recommend nebulisation of interferon-\u03b12b at a dose of 100 000\u2013200 000 IU/kg in mild cases and 200 000\u2013400 000 IU/kg in severe cases, given in twice a day for 5\u20137 days.\u2022Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor use for management of HIV in combination with ritonavir as a booster. Lopinavir and/or lopinavir/ritonavir have exhibited activity against coronavirus in vitro. In the management of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, there was evidence that compared to ribavirin alone, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus ribavirin decreased the risk of ARDS or death.33, 34\n\u2022Remdesivir could be the best possible option for treatment of COVID-19. It is an antiviral agent originally developed to fight Ebola in the class of nucleotide analogues. Experiments in animals infected with MERS-CoV found reduced viral titres and an improvement in lung tissue damage in animals treated with remdesivir compared to controls, and that outcomes were better in the group treated with remdesivir compared to the group treated with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-\u03b2. A phase III clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of infection by Ebola virus has been completed, and there is ample data on its pharmacokinetics and safety. However, the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be established. This drug is not available in Spain. In the United States, it has been used in at least one patient with favourable results.35, 36\n\u2022Other drugs such as chloroquine (antimalarial) or baricitinib (Janus kinase inhibitor) have been considered as alternative treatment options, although their use has not been assessed in clinical trials.37, 38\n\n",
