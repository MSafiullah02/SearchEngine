In this commentary, we will discuss important barriers to achieving isolation in this population, including the need for ethical and clinical frameworks to guide rapid and decisive decision-making.

A pre-pandemic systematic review identified that some common features of outbreaks in nursing homes are delay in the implementation of control measures, and insufficient application of isolation and cohorting.5 In particular, the perception that infection control practices are in conflict with quality of life goals and the rights of the resident are an important barrier to their effective use.6 Several features of the COVID-19 infection \u2014 the duration of the incubation period, asymptomatic spread, and atypical presentations in older adults\u2014 represent challenges to infection control in nursing homes. Isolating and screening nursing home residents based on symptoms alone would fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19.7 Widespread screening in nursing homes may be required, which will identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 positive residents who need to be isolated. Nursing home staff are experiencing moral distress due to the potential harms associated isolation of residents, as well as the severe consequences if these infection control measures are not effectively implemented.",

Principles used to balance the individual rights with collective safety include use of the least restrictive alternative to achieve effective infection control, addressing fairness and justice, and providing transparency and accountability in decision-making to maintain public trust.10 These public health principles are in contrast to the principles which have guided dementia care best practices over the past few decades, with a focus on relational ethics and the ethics of care, and emphasizing trust and responsiveness within the individual therapeutic relationship.11\n,\n12 The use of an ethical framework addressing these conflicts can help to support and guide ethical decision-making.13\n",

First, clinical guidance is needed for the development of isolation care plans that address the personhood needs of the isolated resident and that incorporate safeguards to minimize any harms. Second, there is a need for guidance about the use of pharmacological management, seculsion, and physical restraint measures when less restrictive measures have failed. In the case vignette, we describe the safe and effective use of some of these measures and the steps taken to minimize harm, in a well-resourced setting. Staffing shortages, lack of training and lack of resources place residents at higher risk of harm from more restrictive interventions, including the risk of falls and injuries, stroke, deconditioning, skin breakdown, blood clots, and death. Overall, there needs to be an urgent investment in staffing and training, and additional resources provided to the nursing home sector to support the effective use of necessary infection control measures.",

Seven days after admission, her nursing home confirmed COVID-19 infections in several residents and staff, including a nurse with direct contact with Mrs X. While Mrs. X was asymptomatic, the hospital's guidelines stipulated that COVID-19 exposed individuals should be quarantined for 14 days (7 days of which remained).

Due to her size and strength, she could not be prevented by staff from leaving the room. Seclusion was not possible: the door could be unlocked from inside the room. A door exit alarm15 was used to notify us if she was leaving or another resident was entering the room, but staff responding to the alarm were often faced with directing Mrs. X without time to don PPE. Given that less restrictive measures were not consistently effective, the decision was made to use physical restraints when necessary. Mrs. X was restrained in a geriatric recliner using a pelvic holder with three staff in PPE required to safely initiate restraint. A tray table allowed her to engage in preferred activities and to hold snacks and drinks. In keeping with hospital policies, she was restrained at intervals no longer than two hours, and she was monitored and socially engaged by staff every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes thereafter. If she fell asleep, she was assisted into bed. From the perspective of pharmacological management, her antipsychotic medication was changed to a more sedating agent, loxapine 5mg BID, and increased to 10mg BID three days later, with loxapine 5mg used as needed.",
