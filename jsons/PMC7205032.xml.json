Previously two variants of coronavirus have caused severe illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, with severe acute respiratory distress, resulting in 9.6% mortality; and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, with a higher mortality rate of 34.4% [1-3]. The novel coronavirus (SARS coronavirus 2), the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that probably originated in a seafood market in Wuhan in December 2019 [4,5]. Since then, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), named by the World Health Organization, has affected more than 2 million people worldwide, killing more than 130,000 of them [6]. The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with the launch and development of the 5G mobile network.",

A key benefit of 5G is that some of the current issues with cellular networks such as poor data rates, capacity, quality of service, and latency will be solved [7]. Although there is no scientific proof, the technology is suggested to negatively affect health on certain social media channels [8].",

The issue became a trending topic and appeared visible to all users on Twitter within the United Kingdom. Since then, multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking the two together. The conspiracy has been of such a serious nature that, in Birmingham and Merseyside, United Kingdom, 5G masts were torched over concerns associating this technology and the spread of the disease according to the British Broadcasting Corporation [9]. More concerningly, Nightingale hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom had its phone mast set on fire [10]. This is unwelcome damage especially at a time when hospitals are required to operate with maximum efficiency.",

From April 2-6, 2020, it is estimated that at least 20 mobile phone masts were vandalized in the United Kingdom alone [13]. Social media is an important information source for a subset of the population, and previous seminal research has noted the potential of Twitter for providing real time content analysis, allowing public health authorities to rapidly respond to concerns raised by the public [14]. During the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, recent research has found that platforms such as YouTube have immense reach and can be used to educate the public [15]. Furthermore, recent research has also called for more understanding of public reactions on social media platforms related to COVID-19 [15].",

Users were included in the data set if they sent a tweet during the time the data was retrieved or were mentioned or replied to in these tweets. This specific keyword and hashtag were selected, as this was the most popular and briefly became a trending topic on Twitter within the United Kingdom in early April. The network consists of a total of 10,140 tweets, which are composed of 1938 mentions, 4003 retweets, 759 mentions in retweets, 1110 replies, and 2328 individual tweets. The data was retrieved using NodeXL (Social Media Research Foundation) and the network graph was laid out using the Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale layout algorithm [16]. In interpreting the network graph, the results build upon previous seminal research, which has identified six network shapes and structures that Twitter topics tend to follow [17]. These network shapes can consist of broadcast networks, polarized crowds, brand clusters, tight crowds, community clusters, and support networks. A computer running Microsoft Windows 8 was used to retrieve data in Microsoft Excel 2010 using the professional version of NodeXL (release code: +1.0.1.428+). NodeXL uses Twitter\u2019s search application programming interface (API). URLs were automatically expanded within NodeXL.",

The graph\u2019s vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. Third, a manual content analysis [20] of Twitter data was conducted by removing a 10.00% sample of individual tweets (n=233/2328). Coding categories were created by exploring the data and the extracted sample was read and coded. In our content analysis, mentions were not examined because they are typically conversations between users, and retweets were excluded to avoid overpopulating the sample with similar messages. Retweets and mentions were only removed for the manual content analysis and all other analysis in the study includes them. Only English-language tweets were coded. The coding was confirmed by another author and any disagreements were discussed and resolved, which led to a 100% agreement.",

Isolates groups are a common network structure found in Twitter networks. Large brands, sporting events, and breaking news stories tend to have a large isolates network structure. During a sports event, for example, a large number of users may offer their view or opinion toward a team without mentioning or replying to other users forming an isolates cluster. Group 2 (labeled Group 2 - Broadcast Group) contains a number of Twitter accounts who would tweet that there was a link between 5G and COVID-19, which attracted retweets, giving rise to a broadcast network. Within this group, a number of influential user accounts can also be seen toward the center of the group and a circle of accounts around these. The broadcast network structure is often found in the networks for news accounts and journalists because their tweets are retweeted with high frequency. Celebrities with large followings will also tend to have a broadcast network shape. Group 4 contains the label \u201cactivism account\u201d because it contained an account with the name \u201c5gcoronavirus19,\u201d which was set up to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter that is further discussed in the next section.",

Our results are likely to be of international interest during the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. A further strength of our study is that our methodology can be applied to other conspiracy topics. A limitation of our study is that the Search API can only retrieve data from public facing Twitter accounts. Previous research has noted that certain Twitter topics are likely to contain automated accounts known as \u201cbots\u201d [35]; for instance, in the case of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) tweets, research has found that social bots could be used to promote new e-cigarette products and spread the idea that they are helpful for smoking cessation [35]. A limitation of our study is that we did not identify social bot accounts; however, influential accounts in our study did not appear to display bot behavior (eg, high number of tweets posted) and appeared to display characteristics of genuine accounts. This could be inferred because certain accounts linked to their profile on other platforms such as YouTube. However, future research could seek to identify the ratio of bots to individual accounts related to conspiracy theories. A further limitation is that our content analysis was conducted on English-language tweets, and further research could seek to examine tweets in other languages. Furthermore, a limitation to our study is that, as we retrieved data using a specific keyword, our data may have excluded tweets from users who tweeted about the conspiracy during this time without using our target keyword or hashtag.",

This study conducted an analysis of a conspiracy theory that threatened to potentially undermine public health efforts. We discussed key users and influential web sources during this time, and discussed potential strategies for combating such dangerous misinformation. The analysis reveals that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation, and policymakers should insist in efforts to isolate opinions that are based on fake news if they want to avoid public health damage.
