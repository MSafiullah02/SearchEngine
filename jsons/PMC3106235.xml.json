However, because of the inability to accurately identify the minority of infants who have serious bacterial infections, the majority of febrile infants are hospitalized and receive antibiotics. Existing viral diagnostics, such as enzyme immunoassay\u2013based rapid tests, are limited in sensitivity and detect only influenza and RSV or, in the case of direct fluorescent antibody detection and shell vial culture, require a sophisticated virology laboratory. Furthermore, several of the newer pathogens do not grow well in culture.",

However, other viruses can cause bronchiolitis and are clinically indistinguishable from RSV-induced disease, including parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, hMPV, coronavirus, and bocavirus [12, 13].

Tsolia et al [18] studied 75 school-age children hospitalized with CAP with use of conventional cultures and PCR assays for influenza, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. A pathogen was demonstrated in 58 (77%) of 75, \u22651 virus in 65%, bacterial infection in 40%, and coinfection in 35%. Adenovirus was present in 9 (12%), parainfluenza in 6 (8%), influenza virus in 5 (7%), RSV in 2 (3%), and hMPV in 1 (1%). Thirty-four children were shedding rhinovirus. The significance of detection of this virus was unclear, but the authors found rhinovirus carriage in only 1 of 27 healthy children in the hospital during the same period with use of PCR. Cevey-Macherel et al [19] studied 99 children <5 years of age who fulfilled the World Health Organization clinical criteria for pneumonia. They used PCR to detect M. pneumonia,C. pneumonia, and 13 respiratory viruses, including 4 coronaviruses. A potential pathogen was identified in 86%; 33% had only viral infection, 19% had only bacterial infection, and 33% had mixed viral and bacterial infection. The only clinical sign that helped identify children with bacterial infection was the presence of dehydration. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in children with bacterial infection, but the sensitivity of these tests was modest (72% and 88%, respectively) and the specificity was low (58% and 44%, respectively). There was no association between the radiologic description and the etiology. It remains unclear from these studies whether children with coinfection with viruses and bacteria had more severe illness.",

            "text": "Although it is clear that influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus are important causes of CAP in the absence of bacterial coinfection, the role of rhinoviruses and some of the newly described viruses, including human coronaviruses and bocavirus is harder to determine. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of mild upper respiratory illness, and detection of rhinovirus in asymptomatic persons is relatively common [20, 21]. Jartti et al [21] reviewed studies that reported detection of viruses from asymptomatic adults and children, although some of the participants were household contacts of ill patients. With use of conventional culture, rhinovirus detection was uncommon (mean, 1.5%; range, 0%\u201315%), but with use of PCR, rhinovirus was detected more frequently (mean, 14%; range, 0%\u201345%). The few studies that have performed sequential sampling have shown that PCR positivity is relatively brief [22, 23]. Replication of many strains of rhinovirus is limited at higher temperatures, and this was thought to prevent replication in the lower respiratory tract. However, recent studies demonstrated that rhinovirus can replicate at higher temperatures and infect the lower respiratory tract [24]. Although season- and age-matched control subjects would be helpful, detection of rhinovirus in young children hospitalized with CAP has been substantially higher in some studies than would be expected from children with uncomplicated URTI [16, 25]. PCR-based detection and sequencing of rhinoviruses has revealed a greater degree of genetic divergence than was appreciated with culture-based detection [20, 26]. It is possible that better understanding of these viruses will identify genotypes with greater capacity for lower respiratory tract disease and severe disease [27, 28].",

Fortunately, only sporadic laboratory-associated cases have been detected since containment of the worldwide outbreaks by the end of 2003. Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was identified in the Netherlands in 2004 [30]. It has clearly been associated with croup and bronchiolitis and occasionally with pneumonia [31\u201335]. Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was detected in an adult in Hong Kong in 2005 [36]. In one of the initial studies in Hong Kong, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in 2.4% of patients with CAP [36]. Other studies have shown slightly lower frequency. HKU1 was detected as the only respiratory pathogen in 14 (1.4%) of 1043 specimens from hospitalized children in Seattle [34]. In a prospective active surveillance study involving children <5 years of age in Nashville, coronaviruses, including HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E, were isolated from 2.2% of children hospitalized with respiratory disease. Thus, coronaviruses appear to be a significant but relatively uncommon cause of hospitalization among children.",

Bocavirus has frequently been detected in conjunction with other pathogens and may be detected for prolonged periods. Thus, it has been challenging to demonstrate the clinical importance of bocavirus detection [38\u201340]. However, at least 2 studies showed that isolation of bocavirus alone was more common in ill children than in control subjects [41, 42]. Bocavirus loads were significantly higher in patients with only bocavirus than in those with coinfection [3, 43]. Thus, accumulating data support the role of bocavirus as a true pathogen, but determining the relevance of isolation from an individual patient remains difficult.",

For children with influenza, access to the test results reduced the number of antibiotic prescriptions, the ordering of urinalysis, urine culture, complete blood counts, blood cultures, and chest radiographs. No differences were seen among those who did not have influenza. A quasi-randomized trial of influenza rapid testing showed similar results [51]. When the analysis included all children, the use of a rapid test did not influence clinician behavior. However, among those children who tested positive for influenza by either method, those with a rapid influenza test were less likely to have urinalysis, urine culture, or a complete blood count ordered. Doan et al [50] studied 200 children <3 years of age who were seen in the emergency department for fever and had at least 1 respiratory symptom and randomized them to have a direct fluorescent antibody test for 7 respiratory viruses or routine care. There was no statistically significant difference in duration of emergency department stay; performance of chest radiographs, blood tests, and urine analyses; or use of antibiotic prescriptions between the groups. However, children who were tested had a 64% reduction in the likelihood of receiving antibiotics from another provider within 1 week after the visit. Among those who tested positive for a virus, testing was associated with a median 69-min reduction in the duration of the emergency department stay.",
