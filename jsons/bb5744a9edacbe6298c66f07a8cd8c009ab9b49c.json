There is now a compelling case for extending these efforts to embrace all viruses irrespective of their host organisms. Increasing awareness of the diversity of viruses and greater reliance on storage of information in electronic databases call for standardization of abbreviations to avoid ambiguity. The accurate recovery of information from databases is dependent on the existence of unique abbreviations for virus names. For example, the species name Hepatitis C virus is often abbreviated to HCV in the titles of papers and currently approximately 20% of the publications in the Medline database can only be accessed using the abbreviation rather than the virus name. Fortunately in this case there is no significant overlap. In other cases there can be confusion. For example, the abbreviation RSV is not unique and a database search will recover papers on Rous sarcoma virus, Rice stripe virus, Human respiratory syncytial virus and Bovine respiratory syncytial virus. In its 7th Report [4] the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recommended the use of RSV for Rous sarcoma virus on grounds of historical priority, and HuRSV and BRSV for human and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses respectively. Although the overlap with Rice stripe virus remains unresolved, in practice it causes little confusion. However, it would be better if the overlap did not exist.",

The abbreviations listed in Table 1 are limited to the names of ratified virus species. The names of tentative species, serotypes, strains and other categories have been excluded. The immediate aim is to devise a catalogue of unique abbreviations for virus species. Some ambiguity can be tolerated in the assignment of abbreviations to categories below the species level provided that these abbreviations do not conflict with abbreviations asssigned to speceis. There are some anomalies in the naming of vertebrate viruses, which have still to be resolved. The problem is most acute in the case of arthropod-borne viruses. For example, in the families Arenaviridae and Bunyaviridae the names of several viruses are themselves still in the form of abbreviations and it is not appropriate to assign an additional abbreviation until a scientific name has been agreed. In other instances no abbreviation has been recommended by the ICTV Study Group; e.g. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus. In other situations an abbreviation applied to a synonym may have greater currency than the approved taxonomic name; e.g. EBV for Epstein-Barr virus is likely to be favored for some time by its familiarity rather than the abbreviation HHV-4 derived from the recently revised species name Human herpesvirus 4. Similarly there are some examples where the abbreviation corresponds to a synonym previously used and now out of usage like SFV for Rabbit fibroma virus (synonym Shope fibroma virus).",
