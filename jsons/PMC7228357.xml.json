This has allowed us to make a preliminary estimate that mean R\n0 from the beginning of the epidemic to the first days of February 2020 was 2.2 (range, 3.6\u20105.8), and the birth\u2010death skyline analysis showed an increase in R\ne from less than 1 to 2.4 (CI, 1.5\u20103.5) during December 2019. This agrees with the BSP analysis showing an increase in the number of infections in the same period of time. Commonly, the R\ne decreases during an epidemic because the decrease in the number of susceptible individuals. However, an increase in R\ne could be due to an increase in the transmissibility of the virus or in the contact rates within the population.\n16\n It is, therefore, possible to hypothesize, on the basis of our data, that the first passage of the virus from animal to human occurred through rather inefficient and still unknown transmission modes causing relatively few cases in the early times (before December). In December, the virus acquired a more efficient mode of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (ie, through droplets), causing exponential growth also detected by the skyline.",

Previous studies have suggested that the doubling time during the early phases of the epidemic was approximately 7.4 days.\n10\n The difference in the estimate here obtained, may be due to the increased epidemic growth rate observed during the last days of January, or the initial delay in recognizing and reporting new cases.",
