This situation calls for the most careful use of financial and human resources than ever before. Unfortunately, the preventive measures put in place in medical facilities are not always enough to avoid deaths of medical workers. The loss of trained specialists in emergency care, radiology, etc., is especially concerning. Computed tomography is considered a key tool to diagnose and evaluate the progression of COVID-19. The CT studies are performed in the outpatient setting and target patients with acute respiratory symptoms, and those with established diagnosis and mild disease progression who are able to recover in their homes (under supervision via telemedicine). Inpatient facilities use CT for initial and differential diagnostic assessment, evaluation of disease progression, and determining, whether the patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit or discharged [1, 3, 4] .",
