While the pathophysiology of this deadly virus is complex and largely unknown, we employ a network biology-fueled approach and integrated multiomics data pertaining to lung epithelial cells-specific coexpression network and human interactome to generate Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI). Topological clustering and pathway enrichment analysis show that SARS-CoV-2 target central nodes of host-viral network that participate in core functional pathways. Network centrality analyses discover 28 high-value SARS-CoV-2 targets, which are possibly involved in viral entry, proliferation and survival to establish infection and facilitate disease progression. Our probabilistic modeling framework elucidates critical regulatory circuitry and molecular events pertinent to COVID-19, particularly the host modifying responses and cytokine storm. Overall, our network centric analyses reveal novel molecular components, uncover structural and functional modules, and provide molecular insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Networks encompass a set of nodes and edges, also referred as vertices and links, respectively. Nodes are systems components, whereas edges represent the interactions or relationships among the nodes 5, 6 . In biological systems, genes and their products perform their functions by interacting with other molecular components within the cell. For instance, proteins directly or indirectly interact with each other under both steady-state and different stress conditions to form static and dynamic complexes, and participate in diverse signaling cascades, distinct cellular pathways and a wide spectrum of biological processes. Proteome scale maps of such protein-protein interactions are referred to as interactomes 5, 6 . Meanwhile, specialized pathogens including viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes employ a suite of pathogenic or virulent proteins, which interact with high value targets in host interactomes to extensively rewire the flow of information and cause disease 5, 7, 8, 9 . Therefore, analyzing the network architecture and deciphering the structural properties of host-pathogens interactomes may reveal novel components in virus pathogenicity. Such analysis indicates that diverse cellular networks are governed by universal laws and exhibit scale-free network topology, whose degree distribution follows a power law distribution with a few nodes harboring increased connectivity 5 . Given that diverse biological systems display similar network architecture and topology, several structural features 5 and physical characteristics within a cellular network may act as indicators of important nodes 5 . These include degree (the number of edges of a node), and betweenness (the fraction of the shortest paths that include a node) 6, 10, 11 . Indeed, it has been shown that hubs (high degree nodes) and high betweenness nodes (bottlenecks) are targets of numerous human-viral, human-bacterial and other human diseases 5, . In addition, host protein targets of diverse pathogens were demonstrated to be in close proximity (shortest path) with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 23 .",

This groundbreaking study paved new avenues to investigate novel therapeutic targets using a systems pharmacology approach.

By integrating co-expression network with interactome, we obtained Calu-3-specific human -SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI) containing 4,123 nodes and 14,650 edges. Network analysis indicates that the average degree, betweenness and information centrality of SIPs are enriched in CSI. Module-based functional pathway analyses discovered several disease-related clusters that are enriched in several signaling pathways and biological processes including eIF2 signaling/translation, inhibition of ARE-mediated mRNA degradation pathway, protein ubiquitination pathway, T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis, NER pathway, RNA degradation and retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway. Network topology analyses identified 28 high-value targets of SARS-CoV-2, which can form complexes with other highly influential nodes within CSI. These most important nodes are possibly involved in the viral entry, proliferation and survival in the host tissue as well as required to induce a conducive environment for viral sustenance and pathogenesis. Moreover, we incorporated transcriptome data of COVID-19 patients derived from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with our CSI data. Subsequently, we performed dynamic gene regulation modeling on the CSI nodes to decipher the intricate relationships between important transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of particular of interest is the TF-regulatory relationships involved in host modifying processes such as protein translation, ubiquitination, and the cytokine storm. In summary, our integrative network topology analyses led us elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.",

Apart from the human tragedy, COVID-19 has a growing detrimental impact on the global economy and will likely cause trillions in financial losses worldwide in 2020 alone. COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory illness caused by a highly contagious and pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This single-stranded RNA virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is closely related to another human coronavirus SARS-CoV with 89.1% nucleotide similarity 2, 3 . SARS-CoV and another human coronavirus MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV) caused two previous global epidemics in 2003 and 2012, respectively, both characterized by high fatality rates 2, 3 . These coronaviruses mainly spread from a contagious individual to a healthy person through respiratory droplets derived from an infected person's cough or sneeze, and from direct contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, where the virus can maintain its viability for period ranging from hours to days 2, 3 . Unlike other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 transmits more efficiently and sustainably in the community according to Center for Disease Control (CDC) 4 . While majority of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild to moderate self-resolving respiratory illness, infants and older adults (\u2265 65 years) as well as patients with preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal dysfunction, obesity and cancer are more vulnerable 2, 3 . The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 is complex and largely unknown but is associated with an extensive immune reaction referred to as 'cytokine storm' triggered by the excessive production of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and others. The cytokine release syndrome leads to extensive tissue damage and multiple organ failure 2 . While no vaccine or antiviral drugs are currently available to prevent or treat COVID-19, identifying molecular targets of the virus could help uncover effective treatment.",

To build the human -SARS-CoV-2 interactome, we first assembled a comprehensive human interactome encompassing experimentally validated PPIs from STRING database 32 . Since the STRING database is not fully updated, we manually curated PPIs from four additional proteomes-scale interactome studies, i.e. Human Interactome I and II, BioPlex, QUBIC, and CoFrac (reviewed in 33 ). This yielded us an experimentally validated high quality interactome containing 18,906 nodes and 444,633 edges (Fig. 1a ). Subsequently, we compiled an exhaustive list of 394 host proteins interacting with the novel human coronavirus that was referred to as SARS-CoV-2 Interacting Proteins (SIPs) (Supplementary Data 1).",

By querying these 394 SIPs in the human interactome, we generated a subnetwork of 12,852 nodes and 84,100 edges that covers first and second neighbors of 373 SIPs (Fig. 1a) . Given that the SIPs-derived PPI subnetwork may not operate in all spatial or temporal conditions, coronavirus-specific co-expression data is used to filter the interactions in the context of COVID-19. It is important to note that no exceptionally high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome was available at the time of analysis (details below). Therefore, we took advantage of extensive temporal expression data available for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1b) . Towards this, we performed a weighted coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) in Human Airway Epithelial Cells (Calu-3) treated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV over time in vitro in culture. This analysis yielded a comprehensive co-expression network with 22,445 nodes and 10,649,854 edges ( Fig. 1b) . By integrating this Calu-3 co-expression network with SIPs-derived PPI subnetwork, we generated Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI) that contains 214 SIPs interacting with their first and second neighbors make a network of 4,123 nodes and 14,650 edges (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 1) . We showed that CSI follows a power law degree distribution with a few nodes harboring increased connectivity, and thus exhibits properties of a scale-free network (r 2 = 0.91; (Fig. 1d , Supplementary Data 1), similar to the previously generated other human-viral interactomes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 .

Since such central nodes correspond to proteins that exhibit increased connectivity and/or central positions within a network, we addressed a question whether SARS-CoV-2 also attacks such important nodes within CSI. Towards this, we calculated the average degree (number of connections), betweenness (the fraction of all shortest paths that include a node within a network), load centrality (the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through a node), information centrality (the harmonic mean of all the information measures for a node in a connected network) and PageRank index (counting incoming and outgoing connections considering the weight of the edge) for SIPs, and compared them with their first and second neighbors. We demonstrated that these four topological features of SIPs were significantly higher than the other nodes within CSI (Fig. 2a , b, c and Supplementary Fig. 1a and b, Supplementary Data 2; t-test P < 0.0001). We also showed that SIPs were significantly enriched in CSI compared to the human interactome (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Data 2; hypergeometric P< 3.159E-51). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 targets core structural components of the human-viral interactome, and prompted another question as to whether CSI also activates common biological processes in response to viral infection. Since nodes within CSI not only form protein complexes with each other but also transcriptionally co-express, we reasoned that densely connected nodes within this network may participate in similar biological functions. Towards this, we investigated the underlying modular structures (protein clusters \u2265 5 nodes) in CSI followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). This approach allowed us to identify 27 modules ranging from 5 to 66 nodes for the smallest and largest modules, respectively. Subsequently, we examined the biological processes, cellular pathways and signaling cascades that are modulated in the top 10 modules performed a human phenotype ontology analysis that identifies phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases. Significantly enriched terms included mitochondrial inheritance, hepatic necrosis, respiratory failure and abnormality of the common coagulation pathway ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ). Collectively, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with central nodes of CSI, and these proteins are implicated in core molecular and cellular pathways to establish infection and continue disease progress.",

In addition to hubs and bottlenecks, PageRank algorithm was also effectively used to identify viral targets 27 . Moreover, these physical characteristics can also be used to prioritize the most influential genes in CSI for biological relevance and drug target discovery. Here, we used nine different centrality indices to identify the most influential nodes referred to as CSI Significant Proteins (CSPs). This includes the above described degree, betweenness, information centrality, PageRank index and load centrality as well as additional features such as eigenvector centrality (a measure of the influence of a node in a network), closeness centrality (reciprocal of the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and network), harmonic centrality (reverses the sum and reciprocal operations of closeness centrality and weighted k-shell decomposition) (an edge weighting method based on adding the degree of two nodes in network partition). While weighted k-shell decomposition analysis was recently performed to increase the predictability of host targets of bacterial pathogens 35 , we showed that the top 5% of nodes reside in the inner layers of CSI (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 2) . For other centrality measures, we also maintained a stringent threshold of top 5% to be considered as a highly influential node or CSP. Evidently, we can expect overlapping topological features for the same set of nodes. Noticeably, we observed a strong positive correlation between information centrality and degree ( Fig. 3b ; r 2 = 0.9), betweenness and degree ( Fig. 3c ; r 2 = 0.51) and PageRank and degree ( Fig. 3d ; r 2 = 0.84, Supplementary Data 2).",

It is also important to note that PHB is also targeted by viral proteins of SARS-CoV 34 . These data support previous findings that an individual viral factor can target multiple host nodes and several viral proteins can interact with the same host protein 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 .

Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited largely different transcriptional signatures for BALF and PBMC 36 . We identified a set of 228 and 215 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BALF and PBMC, respectively (p\u2264 0.05, FC \u2265 2.0, Fig. 4a , b, Supplementary Data 4). Thus, CSI constitutes over 25% of transcriptomes pertaining to both BALF and PBMC. Intriguingly, in BALF, we observed that the upregulated cluster A is enriched with eIF2 signaling/translation pathway, while the two down-regulated clusters (B and C) are enriched in retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway (Fig. 4a ). Conversely, one major cluster that is significantly upregulated in PBMC is enriched in T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis and protein ubiquitination pathway (Fig. 4b) . These data further support the notion that significantly enriched protein modules in CSI are involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.",

Among them, we observed the first major wave of differential regulation and activation of TFs at 12-hour post infection. At this bifurcation transcriptional event, we found a set of 4 TFs (YY1, STAT1, STAT2, and SREBF2), which were also expressed in BALF transcriptome. The next major bifurcation occurred at 24-hour post infection, comprising 39 and 43 TFs expressed in BALF and PBMC, respectively (Supplementary Data 4). While we found similar sets of target genes regulated by diverse sets of TFs at different stages of infection, we also discovered multiple combinations of TFs regulating similar sets of downstream genes (Fig. 4c) .

In the present study, we constructed a Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI) by integrating the lung epithelial cells-specific co-expression network with the human interactome. We determined that CSI displayed features of scale-freeness and was enriched in different centrality measures. Identification of structural modules displayed the relationships with a set of functional pathways in CSI. In-depth network analyses revealed 28 most influential nodes.

Numerous human-viral interactomes have previously been generated to uncover global principles of viral entry, infection and disease progression. These include human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, human papillomavirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, HIV-1, and SARS-CoV 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 , and all of these interactomes exhibited a power law distribution. Another significant tenet of interactomes is the existence of modular structures or modules, defined as sets of densely connected clusters within a network that exhibit heightened connectivity among nodes within a module. Such nodes within a module have previously been deemed to possess similar biological function or belong to the same functional pathways 39 . Since nodes in CSI not only form protein complexes but also coexpress specifically to coronavirus infection, we extracted several functional modules from our network ( Fig. 2 e-k). The mostly highly connected module pertains to eIF2 signaling, and is comprised of protein translation-related proteins such as RPS and",

            "text": "Regardless, ribosomal proteins are critical targets of numerous viruses and play equally essential roles in developing antiviral therapeutics 40 . The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) constitutes the major protein degradation system of eukaryotic cells that participate in a wide range of cellular processes, and another critical target of diverse viruses 41 . UPS plays an indispensable role in finetuning the regulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, proteasome-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8. Similarly, UPS is indispensable in the regulation of leukocyte proliferation 41 . The UPS is generally considered a double-edged sword in viral pathogenesis. For example, UPS is a powerhouse that eliminates viral proteins to control viral infection, but at the same time viruses hijack UPS machinery for their propagation 41 . In case of herpes simplex virus type 1, Varicella-zoster virus and Simian varicella virus, induction of NF-\u03baB -mediated host innate immunity is suppressed by the manipulation of UPS components 42 . Moreover, it was revealed that UPS plays crucial roles at multiple stages of coronaviruses' infection 43 . In our study, the ubiquitin proteasome module was composed of several members of 26S proteasome ATPase or non-ATPase regulatory subunits, which includes two CSPs, PSMD8 and PSMA2 (Fig.   3e ). It still needs to be determined whether these two CSPs play important roles in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and are potentially involved in the cytokine storm. While the mechanistic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with these two highvalue targets needs to be explored, both the mRNA and protein expression corresponding to PSMD8 was recently shown to be decreased up to 30% in aged keratinocytes 44 . Since reduced proteasome activity results in aggregation of aberrant proteins that perturb cellular functions, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 targets these CSPs to interfere with ER-mediated cellular responses. Another noteworthy module is the T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis. Indeed, it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause lymphocyte apoptosis demonstrated by overall cell count and transcriptional signatures in PBMC of COVID-19 patients 36, 45 . Another significant CSP in this pathway is MTCH1 (Fig. 3e) , a proapoptotic protein that triggers apoptosis independent of BAX and BAK 46 . We hypothesized that cytokines-mediated induction of cytokine storm is partially dependent on the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with MTCH1.",

            "text": "Our network topology analyses discovered 28 CSI Significant Proteins (CSPs) that have been implicated in several above described modules and pathways (Fig. 3e ). To provide a system-wide perspective of the importance of these CSPs in COVID-19, we categorized these CSPs into three groups based on their possible functionality. Group-1 includes CSPs that are potentially relevant to modifying host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include EEF1A1, ETFA, MRPS27, MRPS5, MTCH1, NDUFA10, RAB1A, RAB2A, RAB5C, RAB7A and RHOA (Fig. 3e) . We hypothesized that such CSPs are important in creating protective environment in host tissue following the viral infection. For example, RAB and RHO group of ras proteins may be involved in augmenting inflammatory signaling pathways. While antioxidants regulating mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins are possibly important in regulating and maintaining redox homeostasis 47 , another CSP, SCCPDH, is involved in the metabolic production of lysine (Lys) and \u03b1 -ketoglutarate (\u03b1-kg) 48 . Intriguingly, L-lysine supplementation appears to be ineffective for prophylaxis or treatment of herpes simplex lesions 49 . We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may target SCCPDH to hijack the biosynthesis of this essential amino acid for its benefit. Group-2 CSPs that we identified are likely to be hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 for its entry, proliferation and survival in the host tissue. In this category, one of the most important CSPs is prohibitin (PHB; Fig. 3e ). PHB is an important protein shown to be a receptor for dengue and Chikungunya viruses 50, 51 . Although it has been shown that ACE2 serves as the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells 52 , it is quite interesting that pathogenesis of the viral infection is not significantly different between the populations of hypertensive patients who receive or don't receive ACE2 inhibitors 53, 54, 55, 56 . Therefore, it is plausible that under certain physiological conditions when SARS-CoV-2 does not engage with the ACE2 receptor for its entry into the cell, PHB serves as an alternative receptor. Another CSP Integrin \u03b2 1 encoded by ITGB1 was recently shown to be required for the entry of Rabies Virus 57 . Whether ITGB1 could also promote the entry of SARS-CoV-2 is another question that needs to be addressed. MEPCE is another important enzyme involved in RNA stabilization by capping the 5\u00b4 end of RNA with methyl phosphate 58 . It is also likely that MEPCE is utilized by the COVID-19 virus for stabilization of its RNA in the host tissue. Similarly, PPP1CA was shown to regulate HIV-1 transcription by modulating CDK9 phosphorylation 59 , and thus is potentially involved in the gene regulation of SARS-CoV-2. As discussed above, PSMA2 and PSMD8 are the two proteasomal CSPs 42, 43, 44 . While infecting the lung epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 may utilize these UPS proteins for the fusion with the host cell membrane (Fig. 3e) . Similarly, NUP98 can also be utilized for viral entry into the nucleus. Additional three CSPs in this category, RPL36 and RPS20 40, 60 as well as SRP72 61 , could be employed for viral transcription and protein synthesis (Fig. 3e) . Finally, Group-3 CSPs are proteins, which SARS-CoV-2 may utilize both to facilitate its proliferation as well as to induce a conducive environment in the host tissue for its sustenance and pathogenesis (Fig. 3e) .",

Intriguingly, EEF1A1, a target of several viruses, is known to be activated upon inflammation 62 . This CSP is independently identified as one of the major regulators in human-SARS-CoV-2 predicted interactome 63 . The CSPs, which regulate protein folding and translation, for example EIAF1, could be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to halt host protein translation, folding and protein quality control. In addition, we also identified E2F4, TBX3 and SMARCB as first neighbors of some of these CSPs. These CSPs complexes play key roles in promoting cell death, causing inflammation and acting enzymatically as viral integrases. Collectively, these CSPs and their first neighbors could directly and indirectly perform intricate pathopysiological functions but those mentioned here could be the key effects of COVID-19 on host tissue dysregulation. This classification is also crucial for the design of effective therapeutic interventions against COVID-19. Finally, we presented transcriptional modeling of CSI genes including CSPs that participate in cytokine storm, eIF2 signaling/translation, protein ubiquitination pathway and T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis. Thus, these signaling pathways and TFs discovered through our analyses could provide important clues about effective drug targets and their combinations that can be administered at different stages of COVID-19.",

This set of proteins is involved in the dynamic regulation of eIF2 signaling/translation-related genes over the course of time. Predominantly, we found that 12 master regulators (CHD2, SIN3A, ETS1, MXI1, CCNT2, E2F4, ELK4, IRF1, GABPB1, ELF1, POLR2A, and HMGN3) of eIF2 signaling/translation are involved in dynamic transcriptional regulation at 24-hour post infection. Interestingly, we revealed that 12 TFs also regulated 9 CSPs (AP2M1, NDUFA10, PHB, PPIA, PPP1CA, RPS20, RTN4, SCCPDH, and UBE2I) along with eIF2 signaling/translation-related genes.Correspondingly, during protein ubiquitination, we identified a total of nine TFs (IRF1, CCNT2, BRCA1, MXI1, CHD2, POLR2A, SIN3A, E2F4, and HEY1) expressed in BALF and PBMC(Supplementary Data 4). Interestingly, in the gene subset related to T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis, we identified a total of 11 TFs (E2F4, ELF1, CCNT2, ETS1, ELK4, HMGN3, SP2, IRF1, GABPB1, MXI1, and SIN3A) expressed in BALF and PBMC that participate in the regulation of this pathway genes including members of CSPs(Supplementary Data 4). Overall, we demonstrated the dynamic transcription patterns of CSI genes and CSPs that participate in cytokine storm, eIF2 signaling/translation, protein ubiquitination pathway and T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 4). Finally, we identified a set of TFs that potentially regulate the above mentioned pathways' genes at various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients.",
