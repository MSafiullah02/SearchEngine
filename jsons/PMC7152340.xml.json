The clinical neurologic signs indicate an upper-motor-neuron lesion and proprioceptive deficits, with involvement of the long-tract sensory pathways in all cases. After onset of hind limb ataxia, sometimes with involvement of the forelimbs, simultaneous and subsequent recorded symptoms include paresis, staggering, knuckling, swaying high-stepping gait (hypermetria), falling over while turning, dragging of the paws or hind limbs, difficulty rising to a standing position, and finally, in the most severe cases, recumbency. In most cases these clinical symptoms are accompanied by slowly developing wasting (disuse atrophy) of the hind limb muscles. In the standing position the hind legs are typically placed more laterally than normal (abducted) in a base-wide stance, and support of the tail is reduced. In some cases, urinary incontinence was indicated by urine soiling of the perineum. Tremor of the head was observed in some advanced cases.",

Throughout the disease progression, the affected cheetahs had a normal appetite, did not seem to experience pain, remained alert, and responded to visual and auditory stimuli.14, 26, 27, 29\n",

Some anecdotal evidence from wild-caught cubs in Namibia has been reported.9 All affected cheetahs have been captive-bred in a European, Middle Eastern, or South African institutions from captive-borne or wild-caught parents, belonging to the South African subspecies (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) or East African subspecies (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii). All affected cheetahs were born from parents without prior clinical neurologic signs. Some of the parents were known to have produced other healthy litters before or after the ataxic litters, and individual parents developed ataxia themselves at a later stage. Often, several or all cubs or siblings from a same litter were affected, with symptoms starting simultaneously in all individuals or developing successively over several months or years. There is no apparent gender predilection, and the age of onset of the ataxia ranges from 2.5 months to 12 years.",

Ataxia has been recorded at institutions keeping only one pair of animals, as well as institutions holding several cheetahs together or in separated paddocks, usually adjacent to each other. In most institutions the cheetahs are housed in visual or auditory range of unrelated cheetahs or other species. Feeding regimen is mostly composed of a daily meat ration (rabbit, goat, chicken, calf), usually supplemented with a vitamin-mineral additive. In a few institutions the meat is attached to a ski lift\u2013like mechanism that provides a simulated hunting situation, encouraging frequent physical exercise.",

Lesions are most prominent from the distal cervical to midthoracic segments, gradually decreasing in severity toward the craniocaudal direction. The degenerative changes are always bilaterally symmetric and often affect the entire circumferential length of lateral and ventral spinal cord funiculi, involving both ascending and descending tracts. The proper fascicle usually is largely spared, and the dorsal tracts are affected only in a few cases, generally older animals. The degenerative lesions are characterized by ballooning of myelin sheaths, either devoid of axons or containing intact or fragmented axons or macrophages (gitter cells, myelinophages). On the longitudinal sections, intact or slightly swollen axons are often seen within dilated myelin sheaths. Spheroids are observed rarely. Depending on the severity and duration of the lesions, myelin sheath vacuolation is associated with varying degrees of astrogliosis, characterized by gemistocytes and proliferation of fibrous processes. Considering the presence of intact axons within dilated myelin sheaths, the lack of features typical for early axonal degeneration, and the excess of myelin loss compared with axonal degeneration, the white matter lesion has been classified as a primary myelin disorder.26, 29 However, based on ultrastructural studies, other authors suggest that demyelination must be considered secondary to axonal degeneration.14\n",

Additionally, the pattern of incidence does not indicate a genetic basis for this disease. However, a genetic component to general disease predisposition and response cannot be ruled out, and anticipation of multifactorial inheritance might play a role.2 In view of the phenotypic similarities of the diseases in the EEP cheetah population with human mitochondrial DNA\u2013associated diseases, the cheetah mitochondrial genome was analyzed to investigate a possible extrachromosomal genetic basis for the myelopathy. One heteroplasmic and two homoplasmic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mitochondrial complex I of cheetahs with and without neurodegenerative diseases were identified. However, a correlation between these SNPs and the myelopathy could not be demonstrated.4\n",

It is not clear from the description of the cases, however, whether pathologic lesions were similar to the later outbreaks. This copper deficiency hypothesis could not be confirmed by other authors or in my experience. Although a significant difference in liver copper level has been shown between cheetahs and dogs and cats, there was no significant difference in the serum copper level.29 Again, this difference in the liver copper levels could be explained by the domestic animals mainly being fed with supplemented industrial food.",

FSE has been reported in several nondomestic cat species, including cheetah, puma, ocelot, tiger, lion, and cougar, but the relatively high prevalence in cheetahs suggests that they may be more susceptible than other zoo felids. To date, nine cases of FSE have been diagnosed in cheetahs.1, 10, 11, 17, 25 All affected cheetahs were older than 5 years, and with the exception of two cheetahs born in France, all were either born in the United Kingdom or imported from there. Clinically, chronic progressive ataxia initially involves the hind limbs but later progresses to involve the forelimbs. Further clinical signs appear with variable frequency and include postural difficulties, hypermetria, muscle tremors (particularly affecting the head), changes in behavior (e.g., increased aggressiveness, anxiety), hyperesthesia and hyperreaction to sounds, ptyalism, prominent nictitating membranes, and blindness. The clinical signs usually develop over about 8 weeks. One affected female had a litter when the clinical signs appeared, but she continued to suckle the cubs throughout the disease period until she was humanely euthanized. One of the three cubs later developed the disease at age 6 years. The diagnosis of FSE requires histopathologic examination of the brain and the finding of characteristic vacuolation. It is broadly accepted that FSE is the result of BSE infection in felids, and the incubation period appears to be 4.5 to 8 years in cheetahs. However, the occurrence of FSE in the offspring of an affected cheetah in France raises the possibility of vertical transmission.",

            "text": "The etiology of this second spinal disorder remains unknown, but it seems important to note that the snow leopards in the Swiss zoo and in the two French institutions were fed with chicken only. Two of these institutions changed the diet to a variety of different meats, supplemented with vitamins and trace elements. The cubs born in these zoos after the diet change did not develop neurologic signs, whereas at the third zoo, which continued to feed chicken, the cubs born were again affected. This may be indicative of a vitamin B or other nutritional deficiency as the cause of the degeneration of the spinal cord in the snow leopard cubs in these facilities.",

            "text": "Besides these two degenerative disorders, we have diagnosed a spastic paralysis of the hind limbs in a 4-month-old snow leopard cub. The necropsy revealed a compression of the spinal cord by a mycotic abscess at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. Microbiologic culture performed on the abscess material revealed the growth of Cladophialophora bantiana. Neurologic diseases resulting from fungal infection are uncommon in human and domestic cats, but further cases of saprophytic infection involving the CNS have previously been reported in snow leopards. Extramedullary thoracolumbar fungal abscesses, caused by Scopulariopsis brumptii, were diagnosed in two young snow leopards,5 and an Aspergillus terreus meningoencephalitis was reported in a neonatal cub.16 It has been suggested that snow leopards may be more susceptible to infectious agents present in more temperate climates, because of a relative lack of exposure to infectious organisms in their natural habitat.30\n",
