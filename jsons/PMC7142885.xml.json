Evidence demonstrates that the virus is transmitted mainly among people who are in close contact with one another or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Although touching infected surfaces or objects is not generally considered the main mode of transmission, that also may be possible (6,7). Routine airborne transmission cannot be excluded, which is supported by the cluster of more than 600 (8) cases of infection inside the Diamond Princess cruise ship. In addition, more than 3,000 infected health care workers in Hubei province (9) and 2,055 laboratory-confirmed cases from 476 hospitals across China have been reported as of February 20, 2020 (10), and the infection rates of serious and critical cases dropped dramatically from 45.0% in early January to 3.7% by the end of the month (11). It has also been proposed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that health care providers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure (12).",

However, a certain number of patients will spread virus to others while they themselves stay asymptomatic (11). The COVID-19 virus is confirmed by testing for 2019-nCoV on respiratory material or serum by using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in accordance with the protocol established by the World Health Organization (WHO) (17). A second test or even more tests are needed because false negative RT-PCR results have been generated in 3% (5 of 167) patients with positive chest computed tomography (CT) findings (18) and in some patients who have recovered from COVID-19 disease (19). It is suggested that a chest CT is highly valuable for more sensitive, earlier diagnoses of COVID-19 (20).",

COVID-19 disease has become a pandemic with high contagiousness and uncertain transmission dynamics. Presently, it is urgent that health care providers take appropriate and effective precautions when standing at the front line, and interventional radiologists (IRs) are not excepted. Although IR is not the practice where infectious diseases are typically treated, given the fact that an evolving role for IR in emergency treatment is revealed, IRs need to be equipped with sufficient knowledge of precaution in daily management of patients. This paper discusses principles of self-protection for IR practice based on WHO evidence, disease transmission-related documents, and the experiences of Chinese IRs gained in the past 3 months.",

As a quick response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Emergency Leadership Committee of this hospital was launched on January 21, 2020, to assess and manage the infection prevention control (IPC) risk; the infrastructure and workflow modifications; human resource control; logistical support; medical supplies and so forth, in preparation for the outbreak. According to COVID-19 infection conditions in Nanjing city and China, the hospital management strategies were dynamically divided into 3 phases. During Phase I, from January 16 to 24, structural and political alterations were made under the guidance of WHO and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. During Phase II, restrictions and controls were upgraded to the highest level, and regular hospital service was kept at a minimal level to ensure maximum prevention of cross-transmission between January 25 and February 14, as the epidemic became transmitted throughout the country. Conditions are currently in Phase III, since February 15, when new cases continuously decreased nationally as well as locally. The major challenge now is to create a balance between the elevated demand of regular medical services and anti-COVID-19 disease efforts.",

Given that most IR theaters are grouped inside the inpatient building, 2 of the 3 IR theaters were redesigned inside the quarantine area for patients without exclusion of COVID-19. As shown in Figure 1\n, the modified IR theater was separated by clapboards into the quarantine zone and the regular zone with a buffer zone between them.

            "text": "The number of COVID-19 patients and infected countries is still growing rapidly. It is inevitable that regular medical practice, including IR, will be reduced because this virus spreads fast, and most people, worldwide, are vulnerable to it. What is worse, 2 mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been discovered (26). As a result, humans may have to live with COVID-19 for a long time. Based on the experiences and lessons learned by the present authors and Chinese colleagues while maintaining necessary IR service against the background of this unprecedented battle, these authors would like to make several recommendations. (i) In correspondence with the hospital emergency leadership committee, establishing an IR Emergency Leadership Team is highly recommended. This team is the headquarters for IR service. The team coordinates emergency instructions from hospital authorities, makes decisions about special cases, and is responsible for IPC risks and medical supplies and other actions. Conditions may change instantly during such an unusual period, so the IR leadership team should have access to instant communications on WeChat and twitter and so forth at all times. (ii) It is essential for all staff to learn and stay current with knowledge of the novel disease transmission. All IR staff including physicians, nurses, technologists, residents, and fellows should complete courses designed by hospital authorities; be familiar with the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnoses, treatments, and potential risks; identify suspected patients; and know the proper use of PPE and infection control measures. Because the on-site events are sharply reduced to block the potential cross-transmission among hospital employees, on-line educational courses are the major forms of education. (iii) Protecting oneself first is always the highest priority before helping patients. All IR staff should obey the strict regulations dedicated to preventing COVID-19 infection, guided by the IPC team. Individuals should be trained on site in the proper use of PPE. The infection protection is divided into 3 levels which require different levels of PPE. The number of personnel in the IR theater should stay minimal. The same principles should apply to nonmedical staff as well, including logistics, security, housekeeping, and patients and visitors. (iv) Modifications and adjustments for existing infrastructure and workflow may change. Even in the authors\u2019 general hospital, the usual allocation of facilities and workflow does not meet the strict requirements for such a highly contagious disease. Reallocations and modifications of IR theaters, in-patient or recovery wards, and workflows are vital. The adjustments and modifications should be made based on the principles of quarantined space and facilities (IR theater, dedicated paths, wards, and the like) and a high standard of decontamination measures (ventilation, strict decontamination in IR theaters, and all spaces in which patients may stay). (v) Classes of management of IR procedures are based on different categories. The necessity for IR procedures is determined by the category of emergency level, namely, sub-emergency and elective treatments. Before the pandemic is officially ended, elective IR procedures should be suspended, emergency procedures should be performed in time, and sub-emergency procedures should only be undertaken after ruling out COVID-19 infection. Also, IR patients are divided into 3 categories, namely, cases of confirmed COVID-19 patients, patients without exclusion of COVID-19, and uninfected patients with virus ruled out. Patients who are confirmed COVID-19 carriers should be taken to a negative-pressure IR theater, whereas patients without exclusion should be taken to a quarantined IR theater and negative patients to a regular IR theater. Different levels of prevention protection measures must be adapted to the corresponding category.",

IRs, like all other health care workers are facing it. This is a battle, a war that is largely different from our routine practices. As a big part of modern medicine, IR plays a unique role in keeping patients safe when fighting against COVID-19 infection. Moreover, IRs can contribute to the treatment of COVID-19 patients who are experiencing emergency IR indications such as hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, vascular diseases, and others. As IRs continue to serve, we must pay attention to our own safety, using the proper protection measures to make ourselves clear of virus.",
