            "text": "The overall prevalence of viral infections in laboratory rats is low and largely relates to global adoption of screening, biosecurity practices, the use of clean air equipment for cage changing and animal manipulation, and housing within individually ventilated cages. Further, the import/export of rats from noncommercial sources has remained low because of the relatively low numbers of genetically engineered rats. However, advances in genetic engineering, including CRISPR technology, could increase the production of genetically engineered rats, resulting in greater infection risks associated with global sharing of unique rats from noncommercial sources. Several serological studies have indicated that parvoviruses, coronaviruses, cardioviruses, and pneumoviruses are the most prevalent (up to 13%) (Mahler and Kohl, 2009, McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-van de Ven et al., 2006). Seroconversion to less prevalent viruses, adenoviruses, hantaviruses, Sendai virus, and reovirus, has also been detected in laboratory rats (up to 0.4%). Since the last edition of this book, a new polyomavirus and a new cardiovirus that cause disease in laboratory rats have been described. In addition, advances in metagenomics are enhancing the ability to detect novel organisms. To this end, metagenomic analysis of feces or intestinal contents from wild rats detected viruses from 19 families, many of which are not screened for in laboratory rats and potentially could cause subclinical infections in laboratory rats. The use of metagenomics is likely to expand our knowledge of the virome of laboratory rodents in the coming years. The major sections of this chapter are DNA virus infections (Section II), RNA virus infections (Section III), and the virome (Section IV).",

            "text": "Adenoviruses are large nonenveloped viruses with 26- to 46-kb linear double-stranded DNA genomes. The genus Mastadenovirus includes adenoviruses that infect humans, nonhuman primates, mice, and several other mammalian hosts. There is serologic evidence that rats are susceptible to infection with one or more mastadenoviruses antigenically related to mouse adenovirus 2 (Ward and Young, 1976). Minimal histologic changes resembling those found in adenoviral infections of mice, with the sporadic development of intranuclear inclusions in enterocytes of the small intestine, were observed in rats seropositive for adenovirus (Ward and Young, 1976). A third of rat sera collected between 1980 and 1985 were seropositive for murine adenovirus 1 and/or 2 (Smith et al., 1986). More recent surveys indicate that the current prevalence of murine adenovirus 1/2 antibodies in laboratory rats is 0.07% (McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009). Infant F344 rats were not susceptible to experimental infection with either mouse adenovirus 1 or 2 (Smith and Barthold, 1987). Mastadenoviruses have been detected in metagenomic analysis of feces, intestinal contents, and sera from wild Rattus norvegicus (Firth et al., 2014, Sachsenroder et al., 2014). Several models of human adenovirus\u2013induced diseases (adenovirus 12-induced neuroepithelial tumors, adenovirus 9-induced mammary tumors, and adenovirus 36-induced obesity) have been established in rats (Javier et al., 1991, Ogawa, 1989a, Ogawa, 1989b, Pasarica et al., 2008).\n",

            "text": "Herpesviruses are enveloped icosahedral viruses with large linear double-stranded DNA genomes (125\u2013240 kb). Rats can be infected with rat cytomegaloviruses (RCMVs; genus Muromegalovirus). Acidophilic intranuclear inclusions in the salivary glands of rats have been reported since the 1930s (Thompson, 1932). RCMV strain Maastricht (RCMV-M), also known as murid herpesvirus 2, and RCMV strain English (RCMV-E), also known as murid herpesvirus 8, were isolated in primary rat embryo fibroblasts from the salivary glands of wild R. norvegicus 50 years later (Bruggeman et al., 1982, Priscott and Tyrrell, 1982). The full genome sequences of these two RCMV isolates indicate that they have genomes of different sizes (230 and 203 kb) and have different genomic organizations (Ettinger et al., 2012, Vink et al., 2000). The RCMV-M genome is substantially different from the genomes of human and mouse cytomegaloviruses (HCMV and MCMV), with only 46%\u201368% of the ORFs having significant similarities (Vink et al., 2000). Murid herpesvirus 8 genomes (RCMV-E, -B, and -ALL-03) share more similarity with the genome of MCMV (murid herpesvirus 1) than with the genome of RCMV-M (Geyer et al., 2015). Natural infection of laboratory rats with RCMV has not been reported. Given that high levels of RCMV are detected in saliva for several months after experimental infection (Bruggeman et al., 1985), it is likely that transmission of RCMV occurs via exposure to saliva. The prevalence of RCMV is believed to be low, although seroprevalence surveys of laboratory rats have not included RCMV. Metagenomic analyses of rat feces and intestinal contents have not detected RCMV. RCMV appears to be infectious only in rats and there is no published evidence for natural infection of rats with cytomegaloviruses from other species or for infection of other species with RCMV.",

Intracerebral inoculation of newborn rats with RCMV-E resulted in 62% mortality over a 3-week period and virus was detected 14 days postinoculation in the liver, spleen, submaxillary salivary gland, lung, heart, brain, and kidney (Priscott and Tyrrell, 1982). Intraperitoneal inoculation of adult rats with RCMV-M resulted in subclinical infection, with the highest viral titers detected in the salivary glands at 4\u20135 weeks postinoculation (Bruggeman et al., 1983). Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions with mild nonsuppurative interstitial inflammation were seen in the salivary glands (Fig. 13.1\n) at 4 weeks postinoculation, and RCMV-M persisted in the salivary glands for at least 6 months (Bruggeman et al., 1983). The striated duct cells of the submandibular salivary glands were the preferred site of replication in immunosuppressed 6-week-old rats inoculated with RCMV-M, whereas the striated duct cells of the sublingual salivary gland were the preferred site of replication in immunocompetent 3-day-old rats inoculated with RCMV-M (Kloover et al., 2000).",

Transplantation of liver or heart from rats latently infected with RCMV-M to syngeneic and allogeneic rats resulted in passive transfer of the virus to the recipients (Bruning et al., 1986). RCMV infection accelerated transplant vascular sclerosis, obliterative bronchiolitis, and chronic rejection in solid organ (heart, kidney, trachea, and lung) transplants (Koskinen et al., 1996, Koskinen et al., 1997, Lemstrom et al., 1996, Steinhoff et al., 1996, Streblow et al., 2003, Streblow et al., 2005, Yagyu et al., 1993). RCMV has been shown to accelerate the onset of diabetes in rat experimental models of autoimmune diabetes and to exacerbate autoimmune collagen-induced arthritis in rats (Griffiths et al., 1991, Smith et al., 1986, van der Werf et al., 2003). RCMV also has been used as a model of neurodevelopmental disorders in neonates caused by HCMV infection during pregnancy. Infection of immunocompetent and immunosuppressed pregnant rats with a Malaysian strain (ALL-03) of RCMV resulted in infection of the placenta and fetuses (Loh et al., 2006). Intraperitoneal inoculation of rats on the first day of pregnancy with RCMV-M caused abnormalities in the embryonic nervous system, which affected learning and memory in weanlings (Sun et al., 2012).\n",

            "text": "Spontaneous parvovirus infections in contemporary laboratory rat facilities are usually asymptomatic. RV and H-1 are pathogenic after experimental inoculation of pregnant or infant rats. In initial reports, spontaneous infections and experimental intraperitoneal or intracranial inoculations with RV and/or H-1 caused fetal deaths resulting in partial or complete loss of litters in dams that appeared otherwise clinically normal, and neonatal rats inoculated with H-1 or RV developed a fulminant generalized disease that was fatal (Kilham and Ferm, 1964, Kilham and Margolis, 1966, Kilham and Margolis, 1969, Margolis et al., 1968). Pregnant dams inoculated intraperitoneally with high doses of RV-Y (gestation days 12\u201318) failed to deliver pups, and fetuses were resorbed, macerated, or mummified, whereas pregnant dams inoculated oronasally delivered normal litters (Gaertner et al., 1996b, Jacoby et al., 1988). Fetuses from pregnant dams inoculated intraperitoneally or oronasally with high doses of RV-UM on gestation days 9\u201312 developed multisystemic necrosis (Gaertner et al., 1996b). A lower dose of RV is needed to infect 2-day-old and 4-week-old Sprague\u2013Dawley rats via the intraperitoneal route compared with the oronasal route (Jacoby et al., 1987). Two-day-old Sprague\u2013Dawley and athymic nude rats inoculated with RV-Y via the intraperitoneal or oronasal route developed anorexia, stunted growth, icterus, diarrhea, oily pelage, dehydration, tremors, and ataxia that often resulted in death between 7 and 28 days postinoculation while 4-week-old rats were asymptomatic (Gaertner et al., 1989, Jacoby et al., 1987). Resistance to RV-induced disease appears to develop by 1 week postpartum and has been attributed to a decline in mitotic activity in target tissues and postnatal development of the immune system (Gaertner et al., 1996b). Therefore, clinical signs induced by RV and H-1 are rarely seen in rats older than 1 week of age. But, paralysis has been reported in adult rats immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and then exposed to RV, and fatal hemorrhagic disease has been reported in weanling rats exposed to RV (Coleman et al., 1983, Eldadah et al., 1967). Hepatitis has been reported in adult rats with partial hepatectomy that were infected with H-1 (Ruffolo et al., 1966). RPV is not pathogenic after experimental inoculation (Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998, Ueno et al., 1997) and experimental inoculation with RMV has not been done.\n",

It is not clear what the natural host of H-1 is, as it was originally isolated from hamsters and rats transplanted with human tumors. Based largely on studies with RV, parvovirus infections in rats should be considered highly contagious. Natural postnatal infections with RV and RPV appear to be due to direct contact with infected rats or by ingestion of virus-contaminated fomites, such as animal bedding (Jacoby et al., 1988, Ueno et al., 1996, Yang et al., 1995). Airborne transmission of RV has not been detected (Yang et al., 1995), even though RV can be detected for a month in the lungs of rats infected as neonates (Jacoby et al., 1987). RV has been detected in the kidneys (renal tubular epithelium and interstitium of the kidney) (Fig. 13.2\n), in urine, and in the intestines of rats infected as neonates (Gaertner et al., 1996b, Jacoby et al., 1987, Novotny and Hetrick, 1970), suggesting that transmission by urine or feces may be possible. RPV also infects renal tubular epithelium (Fig. 13.3\n) and has been detected in urine (Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998, Ueno et al., 1997). While RV can infect intestinal mucosa and lead to fecal excretion (Lipton et al., 1972), the intestine does not appear to be a prominent target of RV. Intestinal infection is prominent with RPV, affecting predominantly the lamina propria, and RPV has been detected in feces (Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998, Ueno et al., 1996). RMV has been detected by PCR in the spleen, kidney, cecum, and mesenteric lymph nodes of naturally infected rats (Wan et al., 2006), suggesting RMV transmission occurs via urine or feces. Prenatal transmission of RV and H-1 is secondary to maternal infection (Gaertner et al., 1996b, Jacoby et al., 1988, Jacoby et al., 2001, Kajiwara et al., 1996, Kilham and Ferm, 1964, Novotny and Hetrick, 1970). However, it appears to require exposure of dams to large doses of RV or H-1. Prenatal infection is uncommon during natural outbreaks in breeding colonies, presumably because dams are exposed to only a low dose of virus.",

            "text": "The risk of transmission is prolonged by persistent RV and RPV infections. There is no evidence that host genotype affects susceptibility to infection of rats with parvoviruses (Jacoby and Ball-Goodrich, 1995). But, susceptibility to persistent RV infection depends on age and immunologic status. Infection in adult immunocompetent rats with RV is usually resolved within 4 weeks, whereas prenatal or perinatal infection can lead to persistent infection lasting at least 6 months, despite the onset of antiviral humoral immunity (Gaertner et al., 1989, Jacoby et al., 1991). Rats persistently infected with RV can transmit virus for 10 weeks (Jacoby et al., 1988). Preexisting humoral immunity can prevent infection, but development of antiviral antibodies does not eliminate the infection (Gaertner et al., 1991, Paturzo et al., 1987). Maternally acquired immunity protects rats born to RV-infected dams from infection and disease (Gaertner et al., 1991, Jacoby et al., 1988, Novotny and Hetrick, 1970). Passive immunization with RV immune serum protects neonatal and juvenile rats from disease and is most effective if it occurs prior to infection, as antibody administered even 1 day after viral exposure provides only partial protection against infection (Gaertner et al., 1991, Gaertner et al., 1995). Immunodeficient (athymic) rats are susceptible to persistent RV infection at any age and the duration of the infection is longer, suggesting an important role for T lymphocytes in eliminating infection (Gaertner et al., 1989). Higher morbidity and mortality were observed in infant athymic rats inoculated oronasally with RV-Y than in euthymic rats, and included anemia and thrombocytopenia (Gaertner et al., 1989). Infectious RPV has been detected, following infection of infant, weanling, and adult rats, for 3 weeks, and viral DNA has been detected for up to 24 weeks (Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998, Ueno et al., 1997, Ueno et al., 1998), a finding consistent with persistent infection.",

Intranuclear inclusion bodies, followed by lysis and segmental or pancerebellar depletion of the external germinal layer (Fig. 13.6\n), lead to granuloprival cerebellar hypoplasia (Jacoby et al., 1987, Kilham and Margolis, 1966). Hemorrhage may be significant in the cerebellum, brainstem, rhombencephalon, and mesencephalon and may result in fatal infarcts (Jacoby et al., 1987). Mild focal necrosis of the lymphoreticular system (thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen) and of the renal tubular endothelium was also observed (Jacoby et al., 1987). Intrauterine infection often results in necrosis of fetuses, placentas, and fetal resorption (Gaertner et al., 1996b, Jacoby et al., 1988, Kilham and Ferm, 1964). Corresponding gross lesions may vary from a reduction to a total loss of viable fetuses and include segmental reddish-black discoloration of the uterus and accumulation of necrotic debris at placentation sites.",

Hemorrhage during acute infection appears to result from viral-induced endothelial injury. Inclusion bodies, viral DNA, and viral antigens have been demonstrated in the endothelium (Fig. 13.7\n) (Gaertner et al., 1993a, Jacoby et al., 1987, Jacoby et al., 2000, Margolis and Kilham, 1970). Endothelial infection can disrupt vascular integrity, can exacerbate viremia, and may facilitate fetal infection through involvement of placental and fetal vasculature. Vascular and intestinal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) appear to be major sites of persistent infection (Gaertner et al., 1993a, Jacoby et al., 2000). Persistent vascular SMC infection may be accompanied by perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, which most often are found in kidney and liver. Viral DNA can be seen in adjacent vessels (Fig. 13.8\n) (Jacoby et al., 2000). It is believed that SMCs sequester nonreplicating RV. RV replication also may continue among mitotically quiescent SMCs (Jacoby et al., 2000). Persistent infection of SMCs does not cause prominent necrosis, but may provoke focal myolysis. Focal SMC infection may exacerbate mitotic activity during cellular repair and may provide additional targets for viral infection.",

Immunohistochemistry detected papovavirus antigens in salivary glands, respiratory airway mucosa, and kidney, and electron microscopy detected intranuclear crystalline arrays of virus particles (Ward et al., 1984). A 2017 study reported the presence of intranuclear paracrystalline arrays of 45-nmnonenveloped icosahedral virions in the prostatic epithelial cells of a Wistar\u2013Han rat with prostatitis in a chronic toxicity study using an immunomodulatory agent (Masek-Hammerman et al., 2017).

The first report of poxvirus infection in rats was in a white rat breeding colony used to supply a zoo in Moscow, Russia, in which over 12,000 rats became severely ill or died (Marennikova et al., 1978). The virus was determined to be distinct from ectromelia virus and vaccinia virus and was considered a CPXV variant. Affected rats developed pulmonary and dermal lesions. Rats with the pulmonary form of the disease had weight loss, became flaccid, were dyspneic, and had increasing abdominal distension and died within 4 days. Deaths in rats with the dermal form of the disease were rare, and rats had rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and a red papular rash on their tail, paws, and/or muzzle, which sometimes led to necrosis of the affected part. Rats that had the mixed form of the infection with both pulmonary and dermal lesions died in 2\u20133 days. Subclinical infection was reported in many of the rats.",

Severity of disease is related to the route of infection.Intranasal or combined intranasal/intradermal inoculation resulted in severe disease, and rats died peracutely with severe dyspnea and lethargy, whereas rats inoculated intradermally or infected by exposure to CPXV-infected rats had less severe disease characterized primarily by dermal lesions and survived until the end of the experiment (11 or 36 days) (Breithaupt et al., 2012). Rats inoculated with cowpox were reported to have proliferative and necrotizing dermatitis and folliculitis, ulcerative\u2013necrotizing rhinitis and pharyngitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and emphysema. Contact sentinel rats had dermal lesions but did not develop upper or lower respiratory lesions (Breithaupt et al., 2012). Histologically, all poxviruses produce basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions (type B, or Guarnieri bodies) in infected epithelial cells, while CPXV and ectromelia virus also produce eosinophilic/acidophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions (type A). Serology using vaccinia virus can be used to detect cowpox antibodies. PCR is used to definitively distinguish CPXV from other poxviruses, such as ectromelia virus and vaccinia virus.",

Mild infection can be clinically silent and revealed by serology or RT-PCR of sentinel or index rats. But clinical signs are common in many outbreaks and can occur in nonimmune rats of any age, usually lasting about a week (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985, Jacoby et al., 1975). Early signs, especially in suckling pups, include squinting, photophobia, and lacrimation. Older rats frequently develop audible sneezing and palpable enlargement of cervical salivary glands. Red-tinged discharges containing porphyrin (chromodacryorrhea) may stain periorbital and perinasal skin. Severe ocular inflammation can initially present as keratoconjunctivitis, which may resolve quickly or become chronic. Chronic ocular inflammation can lead to corneal opacities and ulcers, pannus, hypopyon, hyphema, and megaloglobus (Lai et al., 1976). Ancillary effects attributable to the discomfort of infection include transient anorexia and weight loss (Sato et al., 2001) and disruption of estrus (Utsumi et al., 1980, Utsumi et al., 1990, Utsumi et al., 1991). In addition, birth rates and fertility in breeding colonies have been observed to markedly decline during acute RCV epizootics. Morbidity frequently reaches 100% among rats housed in open cages, but RCV infection rarely causes mortality. Most rats recover, with the most frequent long-term sequelae being ocular disease.",

            "text": "RCV spreads primarily by direct contact with infected rats or by aerosol, and RCV remains infectious for at least 2 days when dried on plastic surfaces (Gaertner et al., 1996a). Experimental studies have demonstrated the ease of horizontal transmission of RCV (La Regina et al., 1992), but there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission. Colony infections often occur in either of two patterns: explosive epizootics among nonimmune animals or endemic infection in rooms where young rats are protected transiently by maternal antibody. Nonimmune, immunocompetent rats excrete virus in oronasal and lacrimal discharges for about 1 week (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985). The onset of antiviral immunity terminates infection and is most easily detected by seroconversion. Immunity offers protection against recurrence of clinical disease, but protection is relatively short-lived (<6 months) and does not preclude transient reinfection, virus shedding, and a resultant increase in antibody titer (Percy and Williams, 1990, Percy et al., 1990a, Percy et al., 1991, Weir et al., 1990a). Reinfection of seropositive animals implies exposure to an antigenically variant strain of RCV. This risk is inherent to coronavirus infections because of spontaneous mutations leading to the emergence of variant strains, especially during endemic infection. Infection of immunodeficient (e.g., athymic) rats is persistent, with chronic necrosis and inflammation in the salivary and lacrimal glands and the respiratory tract (Hajjar et al., 1991, Weir et al., 1990b). In addition, athymic rats can excrete virus for prolonged periods and can develop urinary tract infection, which makes transmission by contaminated urine likely, whereas immunosuppression with prednisolone had a negligible effect on the course of infection, and treatment with cyclophosphamide resulted in only a modest prolongation of infection (Hanna et al., 1984).",

The external nares and eyes may reveal serous exudate and staining of adjacent skin by porphyrin pigment. Acute ocular inflammation includes corneal opacities and swollen conjunctiva, whereas advanced ocular disease may, as noted above, include pannus, hypopyon, hyphema, and megaloglobus (Lai et al., 1976).",

In addition, immunohistochemistry on and virus isolation from tissues collected during acute infection can aid in diagnosing an RCV infection, keeping in mind that the virus is eliminated rapidly with the onset of host immunity. Gross and microscopic lesions, particularly necrosis and inflammation of the salivary and lacrimal glands, are virtually pathognomonic for RCV infection, as they are not duplicated in other known diseases of rats. The course of infection and tissue repair is sufficiently prolonged (4\u20136 weeks) to facilitate detection of acute or reparative stages. Because acute lesions develop within 5 days of exposure to the virus and are often reflected in clinical signs, it is best to select animals for pathologic study that have active clinical signs or that have been in recent contact with rats with clinical signs. Serology is used routinely to detect or confirm infection. However, it generally takes 7\u201310 days after initial exposure to virus before an individual rat becomes seropositive. Because RCV is antigenically related to mouse hepatitis virus (Barker et al., 1994), mouse hepatitis virus antigens can be used in serologic testing to detect RCV infection (Percy et al., 1991, Peters and Collins, 1981, Smith and Winograd, 1986).

RnorPyV2 infection in immunodeficient rats can result in basophilic intranuclear inclusions in the epithelium of salivary, lacrimal, and Harderian glands and is accompanied by ductal and acinar degeneration with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate (Besch-Williford et al., 2017). Porphyrin-tinged nasoocular discharges can occur when rats are subject to other stressors, or during other infectious diseases of the respiratory tract, such as mycoplasmosis.

RCV infection is eliminated by the immune system in immunocompetent rats. However, it can remain endemic in any colony where naive nonimmune rats are regularly added. If an RCV infection is detected and it is determined that it will not interfere with research objectives, an alternative strategy to culling of infected rats is to exploit RCV\u2019s highly transmissible nature for control. By purposefully exposing all rats to RCV, under strict biocontainment practices, immunocompetent rats will develop immunity that protects against reinfection with a homologous RCV strain. If there are breeding rats in the affected colony, production should cease in breeding colonies for about 6 weeks. After this interval, seropositive rats can be moved to a different room to resume breeding, because they should no longer be contagious (Brammer et al., 1993). Here, as well, purposeful exposure of breeding stock will accelerate colony-wide immunity, which also will lead to protection of normally susceptible litters by maternally acquired immunity.",

            "text": "Understanding the interactions between the immune response and coronavirus infections in the lungs has been spurred by the severe respiratory disease induced by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and, more recently, by Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Serially passaged SARS-CoV was used to intranasally infect young and aged F344 rats. Aged rats had more severe lesions, which included pulmonary edema, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage, similar to what is observed in early human SARS infections. Neutrophils and activated macrophages were the predominant inflammatory cell infiltrate. There were no histopathologic lesions in extrapulmonary tissue. The authors demonstrated that advanced age and virus adaptation are required for SARS development (Nagata et al., 2007). More generally, RCV is used to better understand the host\u2013pathogen relationship in pulmonary disease. The primary target of RCV in the alveoli is the type 1 alveolar epithelial cells (Funk et al., 2009, Miura et al., 2007). Using an in vitro model system, RCV infection induced proinflammatory cytokines and, specifically, CXC chemokines that inhibit polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) apoptosis in type 1-like alveolar epithelia (Miura and Holmes, 2009, Rzepka et al., 2012). Furthermore, it was shown that RCV-infected rats deficient in PMNs have more severe and prolonged disease, indicating PMNs are required for an effective antiviral response but also contribute the lung pathology (Haick et al., 2014).",

Two novel rat coronaviruses were detected using RT-PCR of tissues in wild rats trapped in China; Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV) and Longquan R1 rat coronavirus (LRLV). LRNV is the first rodent coronavirus assigned to the genus Alphacoronavirus. It is genetically distinct enough to be considered as a new species of coronavirus and, importantly, has a recombination origin, implicating recombination among coronaviruses of different genera. LRLV is assigned to the Betacoronavirus genus along with RCV and mouse hepatitis virus. Tissues sampled included liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and rectum, but the specific tissue in which LRLV was detected was not identified (Wang et al., 2015). Another rat coronavirus, HKU24, was also detected by RT-PCR of alimentary tract samples from wild Norway rats collected from public areas in China. Although distinct from the murine coronaviruses, phylogenetic analysis of HKU24 suggests it represents a murine origin betacoronavirus that underwent intraspecies transmission from rodents to other mammals prior to the emergence of human coronaviruses (Lau et al., 2015). These studies demonstrate the potential for novel rat coronavirus infections to emerge/reemerge within populations of wild rats and are relevant to the importation of rats, especially if they are of wild origin or potentially had contact with rats of wild origin.",

Over 100 cases of transmission of Seoul virus from laboratory rats to laboratory personnel have been reported (Desmyter et al., 1983, Kawamata et al., 1987, Lloyd et al., 1984, Lloyd and Jones, 1986, Umenai et al., 1979, Wong et al., 1988).

Virus was detected in the lung, brain, spinal cord, salivary glands, pancreas, spleen, kidney, liver, and skin for 25 weeks in rats inoculated as neonates (Compton et al., 2004, Mori et al., 1991, Tanishita et al., 1986, Yamanouchi et al., 1984, Zhang et al., 1989). In situ hybridization of tissues from rats inoculated at 6 days of age detected viral RNA in SMCs, endothelial cells, and glandular and renal epithelium (Compton et al., 2004). Infection does not cause significant tissue damage, but can provoke mononuclear cell infiltrations in affected tissues, including lung, salivary gland, pancreas, and kidney. Pancreatic lesions may cause insulitis with at least transient elevations in blood glucose (Compton et al., 2004). Infection of the inner ear has been described following experimental infection of neonatal rats (Tamura et al., 1989).",

            "text": "Infection of immunocompetent weanling and adults rats with Seoul virus causes a subclinical infection. A transient viremia was seen 2\u20133 days postinfection (Kariwa et al., 1996) The distribution of virus was similar to that seen in neonates, with the highest titers of virus found at 2 weeks (Hannah et al., 2008). By 6 weeks postinoculation, virus titers were low and were less consistently detected in lung, spleen, kidney, and salivary glands (Compton et al., 2004, Klein et al., 2001, Tanishita et al., 1986). Persistent infection occurs in the presence of a strong humoral immune response (Compton et al., 2004). Infection of immunodeficient adult nude rats with Seoul virus caused a disease similar to that seen in neonatal mice, resulting in limb paralysis, ataxia, convulsions, and sudden death within 10 weeks, indicating a role for T cells in the control of Seoul virus infection (Dohmae et al., 1994). The role of the immune response in the persistent Seoul virus infections in rats is unclear, but the activation of regulatory T cells and the ensuing suppression of proinflammatory responses by Seoul virus could contribute to persistence of the virus (Easterbrook et al., 2007c, Easterbrook and Klein, 2008a, Easterbrook and Klein, 2008b). Male rats are more susceptible to Seoul virus infection, producing higher and longer antibody responses, shedding virus for longer, and consistently having higher viral titers in the lung, spleen, and saliva (Klein et al., 2000, Klein et al., 2001, Klein et al., 2002). Innate and cell-mediated immune responses differ between Seoul virus\u2013infected male and female rats (Easterbrook and Klein, 2008b, Hannah et al., 2008). Increased testosterone and aggression have been associated with high levels of Seoul virus in male rats (Easterbrook et al., 2007a).",

The prevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies in wild R. norvegicus in the 1990s in the United States ranged from 44% to 90% (Favorov et al., 2000, Kabrane-Lazizi et al., 1999). In 2010 and 2011, two novel HEVs were detected by RT-PCR in wild R. norvegicus in Germany and the United States (Johne et al., 2010, Purcell et al., 2011). HEV RNA and antigens were detected in the liver of the wild rats (Johne et al., 2010). HEV from wild rats was transmissible to Sprague\u2013Dawley and nude rats (Purcell et al., 2011). Sprague\u2013Dawley rats inoculated with rat HEV seroconverted and shed HEV in their feces, and mild hepatitis characterized by foci of necrosis in the liver parenchyma and aggregates of lymphocytes and Kupffer cells in the hepatic lobules was seen (Purcell et al., 2011). Nude rats inoculated with rat HEV had high levels of rat HEV RNA in feces and serum but not in urine on days 1\u201328 (Li et al., 2017). Immunocompetent Wistar rats inoculated with rat HEV had high levels of rat HEV RNA in feces on days 5\u201315, and the development of anti-HEV antibodies by 2 weeks seemed to have resulted in clearance of the infection (Li et al., 2017). The genome sequences of over 50 strains of rat HEV (orthohepevirus C) have been elucidated from rats in the United States, Europe, and Asia (Ryll et al., 2017). Rat HEVs are genetically distinct from human and porcine HEVs (orthohepevirus A) and from avian HEV (orthohepevirus B) (Ryll et al., 2017). Experimental infections of rats with orthohepevirus A have been unsuccessful and experimental infection of pigs and nonhuman primates with orthohepevirus C were also unsuccessful (Li et al., 2013a, Li et al., 2013b, Purcell et al., 2011). As of this writing, rat HEV infection in laboratory rats has not been reported.",

While mice are the primary targets of Sendai virus infection, there have been reports of natural outbreaks in rats (Burek et al., 1977, Makino et al., 1973). Sendai virus also is infectious for hamsters and guinea pigs (Parker et al., 1978). Sendai virus seroprevalence in laboratory rats is very low (0%\u20130.4%) (McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-van de Ven et al., 2006). Seroprevalence in wild rats in Baltimore in 2005\u201306 was 4.2% but recent metagenomic analyses of feces or intestinal contents from wild rats did not detect Sendai virus (Easterbrook et al., 2008, Firth et al., 2014, Sachsenroder et al., 2014).",

During an epizootic of Sendai virus in mice in the Netherlands, multifocal interstitial pneumonia was observed in rats that seroconverted to Sendai virus, but virus could not be isolated from the rat lungs (Burek et al., 1977). Also, during several rounds of Sendai virus infection in a facility in Japan, signs of respiratory disease and retarded growth in suckling rats were observed (Makino et al., 1973). Epizootic infection was punctuated by fresh clinical outbreaks, typical for acute viral infections in which recovery leads to transient maternally derived immunity, followed by renewed susceptibility (Makino et al., 1973). Antibody responses to Sendai virus in both outbreaks remained high for several months, but declined to low or undetectable levels within 9 months (Burek et al., 1977, Makino et al., 1973).",

            "text": "Immunocompetent rats of all ages are susceptible to experimental intranasal Sendai virus infection. Sendai virus infection of young adult Sprague\u2013Dawley rats caused rhinitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Lesions were confined to the nasal cavity, trachea, and lung, with sporadic involvement of the middle ear (Giddens et al., 1987). Rhinitis was maximal on days 4\u20136 and persisted for 3 weeks, with viral antigen detectable in the columnar epithelial cells of the nasal cavity from day 1 to 7 (Giddens et al., 1987). Histologically, lesions were characterized by epithelial necrosis with mucosal infiltration by neutrophils and lymphoid cells. Bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia were observed starting on day 1 and viral antigen was detected in the bronchial/bronchiolar/alveolar epithelium from day 1 to 5 (Giddens et al., 1987). The epithelium underwent necrosis and erosion, which may be accompanied by epithelial hyperplasia (Fig. 13.18\n). Peribronchial lymphoid infiltrates were detectable through day 42. Lesions in the trachea were similar to those seen in the bronchi (Giddens et al., 1987). Infectious Sendai virus was recovered from the lungs and nasal cavity through day 8 and antiviral antibodies were detected for 9 months (Garlinghouse et al., 1987). Resolution of pneumonia in immunocompetent rats begins within 2 weeks after exposure and is largely complete within 3 weeks (Sorden and Castleman, 1991). Residual lesions include perivascular and peribronchial accumulations of mononuclear cells, which may last up to several weeks. Rat strain differences in susceptibility to Sendai virus have been reported. Brown Norway rats infected with Sendai virus have prolonged viral replication and produce much higher viral titers than Fischer 344 rats (Sorden and Castleman, 1991). Young Brown Norway rats infected with Sendai virus also develop increased airway resistance and hyperresponsiveness with bronchial fibrosis that is associated with increased bronchiolar mast cells (Uhl et al., 1996). More severe rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis were observed in Lewis rats compared with Fischer 344 rats (Liang et al., 1995).",

Sendai virus was detected by electron microscopy in bronchiolar ciliated and nonciliated cells, alveolar type I and II epithelial cells, and macrophages of weanling rats infected with Sendai virus (Castleman et al., 1987). Pneumonia was maximal in weanling rats at 5 days and in neonatal rats at 8 days. Infectious Sendai virus was recovered from the lungs of weanling rats for 6 days and from the lungs of neonatal rats for 10 days (Castleman et al., 1987). Elimination of virus coincides with the onset of antiviral immunity and the delay in Sendai virus clearance from neonatal rats is associated with the delayed onset of antiviral antibodies and interferon response (Castleman et al., 1987, Liang et al., 1999). Passive transfer of anti-Sendai virus antibodies protected rats from lower airway but not from upper airway infection (Liang et al., 1999). Sendai virus infection impaired postnatal alveolar and bronchiolar growth, resulting in alveolar and bronchiolar hypoplasia (Castleman, 1984, Castleman et al., 1988).",

Embryonic deaths were also reported during an outbreak of Sendai virus and Pasteurella pneumotropica in rats (Carthew and Aldred, 1988). Athymic rats inoculated with Sendai virus had extensive pneumonitis with necrosis and hyperplasia of the bronchial epithelium and virus was detectable for at least a month (Carthew and Sparrow, 1980). Sendai virus has been reported to increase the severity of Mycoplasma pulmonis\u2013induced lung, tracheal, nasal, and inner ear lesions in gnotobiotic Fischer 344 rats (Schoeb et al., 1985). It was noted that natural infection of Sendai virus in conjunction with M. pulmonis increased susceptibility to neurogenic inflammation in the trachea (McDonald, 1988). Experimental Sendai virus infection alone was able to potentiate neurogenic inflammation in the trachea (Piedimonte et al., 1990).",

            "text": "ECMV (cardiovirus A) causes lethal infections in a broad range of species, including pigs, nonhuman primates, and elephants, and has a worldwide distribution (Doi, 2011). Mice and rats serve as reservoirs for ECMV and have been linked to several outbreaks in zoos and pig farms. Young rats are more susceptible to ECMV than adult rats. Intraperitoneal or intranasal inoculation of 3- to 25-day-old rats with mouse brain stocks of ECMV resulted in paralysis and death within 8 days, whereas inoculation of 35- to 40-day-old rats resulted in asymptomatic infection (Findlay and Howard, 1951). In rats inoculated intraperitoneally with ECMV at 2\u201314 days of age, acute meningoencephalitis with small foci of neuronal necrosis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus was observed, whereas in rats inoculated intracerebrally at 28 or 56 days of age, no lesions were observed (Ikegami et al., 1997). ECMV was efficiently transmitted from 8-week-old rats inoculated oronasally to contact rats, with infectious ECMV detectable in the feces of inoculated and contact rats between days 2 and 29 (Spyrou et al., 2004). ECMV was isolated on days 11\u201322 from the heart, spleen, lung, pancreas, thymus, Peyer's patches, and liver of over 80% of inoculated and contact rats, but on days 57\u201362, ECMV was isolated only from the thymus and Peyer's patches (Spyrou et al., 2004). While the infection was subclinical, histologically focal interstitial pancreatitis, depletion of thymus and Peyer's patches, and interstitial pneumonia were evident, and ECMV antigen was detected in the cardiac muscle cells, pancreatic acinar cells, hepatic epithelial cells, and macrophages in the spleen, lung, and thymus (Psalla et al., 2006). Experimental Trichinella spiralis infection of rats increases the severity of ECMV disease (crippling and death) in 2-month-old rats (Kilham and Olivier, 1961).",

In 1961, a neurotropic TMEV-like cardiovirus called MHG virus was isolated from Sprague\u2013Dawley rats and it infected intestine, lung, and brain after experimental inoculation (McConnell et al., 1964). In 1991, another TMEV-like cardiovirus (NGS910) was isolated from intestinal homogenates from clinically normal sentinel rats seropositive for TMEV (Ohsawa et al., 2003). Sequencing of NGS910 revealed that it had only 74% identity with TMEV (Ohsawa et al., 2003). Inoculation of neonatal rats with intestinal homogenates from clinically normal sentinel rats seropositive for TMEV resulted in paralysis (Rodrigues et al., 2005). RTV1 was isolated from neonatal rats exposed to solid bedding from rats seropositive for TMEV and has 95% identity with NGS910 (Drake et al., 2008). Four-week-old Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were more susceptible than CD rats to RTV1 infection in that they shed virus in feces for longer (56 days vs. 14 days) and seroconverted earlier (14 days vs. 56 days), though lesions were not seen in either rat strain (Drake et al., 2008). Shedding of RTV in feces from immunocompromised nude rats and immunocompetent (Brown Norway and Fischer 344) rats infected as weanlings was high for the first 2 weeks, with persistent shedding in nude rats but not in immunocompetent rats (Drake et al., 2011). RTV persisted in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen of nude rats but not those of immunocompetent rats (Drake et al., 2011). Serum antibody responses in Brown Norway and Sprague\u2013Dawley were significantly higher than those in Fischer 344 and CD1 rats (Drake et al., 2011).\n",

PVM cause rhinotracheitis and interstitial pneumonia in mice, but also causes asymptomatic infections in rats, cotton rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits (Eaton and VanHerick, 1944, Horsfall and Curnen, 1946). Seroconversion of rats to PVM has been reported since 1978 but PVM was not isolated from rats until 1995 (Miyata et al., 1995, Payment and Descoteaux, 1978). Reports of seroprevalence of PVM in laboratory rats range from 0.1% to 1.6%, ranking it among the top four most prevalent agents in rats (Mahler and Kohl, 2009, McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-van de Ven et al., 2006). PVM infection in immunocompetent rats is generally asymptomatic, though PVM infection in F344 rats has been associated with decreased body weight and lower prevalence of spontaneous leukemia. PVM infection in F344 rats has also been reported to cause multifocal nonsuppurative vasculitis and acute pneumonia in the lung at day 6 postinoculation (Vogtsberger et al., 1982). Pulmonary lesions were reported in F344 nude rats after PVM infection (Miyata et al., 1995).",

There are no documented reports of natural reovirus infection in rats,although, in rare cases, rats develop antibodies to reoviruses (Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-van de Ven et al., 2006). Metagenomic analyses of rat feces did not detect reovirus RNA (Firth et al., 2014, Sachsenroder et al., 2014).",

Most newborn Wistar rats inoculated with REO3 died between 6 and 15 days and had small spleens, thymuses, and lymph nodes, and the surviving rats were runted (Bennette et al., 1967). Two other studies using infant Sprague\u2013Dawley rats inoculated intracerebrally or subcutaneously with REO3 produced an acute fatal hemorrhagic encephalitis within 2 weeks (Raine and Fields, 1974, Spandidos and Graham, 1976). The initial targets in 22- to 30-day-old rats inoculated intravenously with REO1 or REO3 were the liver and lungs (Verdin et al., 1988). Rats (25\u201328 daysof age) inoculated intratracheally with REO1 or REO3 have been used as models of viral pneumonia (Farone et al., 1996, Morin et al., 1996). Parenteral inoculation of pregnant rats with REO3 resulted in maternal viremia and placental infection, but clinical signs were not observed in dams and neonates (Margolis and Kilham, 1973).",

The eight species of rotaviruses are classified as groups A\u2013H. Infectious diarrhea of infant rats (IDIR), a nonlethal illness in rats that resembles rotavirus-caused epizootic diarrhea of infant mice (Vonderfecht et al., 1984), is caused by a group B rotavirus antigenically distinct from epizootic diarrhea of infant mice virus (group A) (Vonderfecht et al., 1985). Group B rotaviruses infect humans, rats, piglets, lambs, and calves (Vonderfecht et al., 1985). Suckling rats inoculated with IDIR develop clinical signs within 2 days, which include diarrhea for up to 1 week accompanied by cracking and bleeding of the perineal region; dry, flaky skin; and transient weight loss (Salim et al., 1995, Vonderfecht et al., 1984). Gross lesions included distended ilea and colons (Vonderfecht et al., 1984). One day postinoculation, small intestinal villous epithelial syncytia, villous epithelial necrosis, and villous shortening were evident, and cytoplasmic inclusions of viral particles were seen in syncytial cells (Huber et al., 1989, Vonderfecht et al., 1984). Three days postinoculation, syncytia and necrosis were not observed, but the villous epithelium was disorganized and vacuolated and crypt epithelium was hyperplastic (Huber et al., 1989). Virus was detected in intestinal washings only between 18 and 72 hpostinoculation (Salim et al., 1995). Although rats of all ages are susceptible to infection, clinical disease did not occur in rats 2 weeks or older (Vonderfecht et al., 1984).",

As has occurred with mice, the demand for the worldwide exchange of unique rat strains will probably increase, as will the unintended consequences of exposure to and spread of \u201cclassical\u201d and new viral infections. Although quarantine and biosecurity practices have advanced, these safeguards are likely to be challenged given the known rat viruses and, perhaps more importantly, the unknown viruses lurking within both the laboratory and the wild populations of rats.",
