Even though laboratory and epidemiological studies have demonstrated the effects of ambient temperature on the transmission and survival of coronaviruses, not much has been done on the effects of weather on the spread of COVID-19. This study investigates the effects of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and the specific government policy intervention of partial lockdown on the new cases of Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project. Considering the nature of the data and the objectives of the study, a time series generalized linear model which allows for regressing on past observations of the response variable and covariates was used for model fitting. The results indicate significant effects of maximum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation in predicting new cases of the disease. Also, results of the intervention analysis indicate that the null hypothesis of no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown should be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5% level of significance. These findings provide useful insights for policymakers and the public.",

This was first put out by [10] , whose findings informed us that temperature and irradiance of COVID-19 will decide the trajectory of the pandemic at warmer regions as well as whether rising temperatures will change direction and have consequences on public health policy. They also showed that case and death counts at higher temperatures (>14 \u00b0C) when aligned for the epidemic stage had significantly lower rates of growth. However, according to [8] , in warmweather locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, COVID-19 have also proven lethal and pose wider concerns on the environmental factors. [12] studied the association between temperature and number of new infections in 122 cities in China and made some important revelations including the fact that temperature less than 3 \u00b0C was positively linked to newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. Another work done by [13] on the \"role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID-19 cases\" affirms what was revealed by [12] and [10] . Their conclusion was that, temperature and humidity explain a total of 18% variability in the disease doubling time while the rest (82%) may be attributed to containment initiatives, general health policies, population growth, and transport or cultural aspects.",

[28] also in a study suggested that for northern hemisphere countries, the rate of transmission of COVID-19 cases would significantly decrease as a result of warmer weather. [29] in a study stated that local weather condition with low temperature, mild diurnal temperature range and low humidity likely favor the transmission of COVID-19 cases in China. [30] in a study, analyzed the association between COVID-19 and climate indicators in New York City, USA. The authors used a secondary published data from New York city health services and National weather service, USA. The climate indicators included in the study were average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, average humidity, wind speed, and air quality. Using Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests for the data analysis, [30] suggested that that average temperature, minimum temperature, and air quality were significantly associated with COVID-19. Finally, using a global data on COVID-19 reported cases until 29th February 2020 and climate temperature data, [31] suggested that higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1\u00b0C and higher.",
