Since then, however, more regions have launched pathogen detection campaigns and, because younger children cannot wear masks and have not taken other special preventive and control measures, the number of child infection cases has increased significantly, especially in younger age groups and, therefore, should be given high attention. 8 On 2 February 2020, the PRC issued a notice on \"doing a good job in the prevention and control of pneumonia outbreaks in children and pregnant women with new coronavirus infection,\" which clearly states that children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 due to the immaturity of their immune systems. 1 The latest guidelines also make it clear that all individuals, including children, are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. 9 Furthermore, children exhibit certain particularities and cannot clearly describe their own health status or contact history, which has contributed to the severe challenge of protecting, diagnosing, and treating this population. 10 Due to the increasing global spread of SARS-CoV-2, China is now facing the risk of transmission of imported cases, which poses new challenges for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic among Chinese children. At the same time, children with other (ie, comorbid) diseases (such as congenital heart, lung and airway diseases, malnutrition, and tumors, etc) are vulnerable to infection with SARS-CoV-2; more specifically, \"prone to severe illness.\" 11 The present article reviews the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children. 13 and, as of 26 February 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in Wuhan, China was 490. 14 Two children with COVID-19 were diagnosed in Germany on 4 February 2020 1 and a 5-year-old child in the Philippines was also diagnosed. 15 Canada reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19, who still carries the virus after rehabilitation and discharge, and is a possible communicator. 16 Zou et al 17 analyzed the relationship between viral load and symptoms of infection in 18 patients with COVID-19, and found that the pattern of viral nucleic acid excretion in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to that of influenza and that the viral load determined in asymptomatic patients was similar to that of those with symptoms, which indirectly suggested potential transmission capacity in asymptomatic or mild cases with COVID-19. Current studies have shown that the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, and most commonly 3 to 7 days. 9 However, Guan et al 18 described a patient with an incubation period of up to 24 days.",

All patients in the study were in the late stages of pregnancy; as such, evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was insufficient. Nevertheless, the possibility of early or midgestational vertical transmission could not be determined. In addition, the study did not collect vaginal mucosal samples or birth canal shedding samples; therefore, it was not possible to analyze whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could be transmitted during vaginal delivery. 53 It is also uncertain whether breastfeeding leads to vertical transmission from mother to child. There is no direct evidence of vertical mother-to-child transmission; however, newborns can be infected through close contact.",

The first epidemic peak occurred between 24 and 26 January 2020, and then gradually decreased from 1 February 2020. 35 Shen et al 55 evaluated the role of the Wuhan \"limit inflow and outflow\" strategy in controlling the epidemic through mathematical models. The study predicted that \"limit inflow and outflow\" could reduce all cases of infection and by nearly 70%, assuming that all individuals wore a mask after \"limit inflow and outflow\" and that masks could reduce the risk for infection by 90%.",

The R0 value not only indicates the rate of transmission of the virus but also reflects the potential and severity of the outbreak of infectious diseases.38 Many research institutions have analyzed the R0 value of SARS-CoV-2, among which Li et al 39 calculated the R0 value of SARS-CoV-2 to be 2.2. Mahase reported that R0 fluctuated between 1.4 and 2.5. 40 Using a sample size of 8866, Yang et al 33 calculated a SARS-CoV-2 R0 up to 3.77 (95% confidence interval, 3.51-4.05). That study demonstrated that the longer the infection period, the higher and longer the reported rate, the higher R0. 33 Based on these studies, it is clear that the estimated R0 values were all greater than 1, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is in an epidemic phase and has a strong transmission capacity. Research data from Chen et al 41 showed that the R0 value for SARS-CoV was \u223c2 to 5 and less than 1 for MERS-CoV. 41 As such, the R0 values of SARS-CoV-2 (1.4-5.5) and SARS-CoV (2-5) are similar and significantly higher than that of MERS-CoV. To measure the spread of the disease following the adoption of prevention and control measures, Yang et al studied the effective reproductive number (Rt value), which represents the average number of follow-on cases of infection per infected person at time t. The Rt value after the human intervention will decrease slightly with effective prevention and control measures. The results of the study revealed that from 25 December 2019, the Rt value of SARS-CoV-2",

            "text": "According to the latest release from the National Health Commission, PRC, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact(s). Spread is also possible through the conjunctiva, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in relatively closed environments with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols may also facilitate transmission. More specifically, the air-tightness of the environment and the density of viruses per unit volume can affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 9 Because SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, the virus must first come in contact with cells that express the receptor. Human mucosal cells express ACE2 receptors, and the lips, eyelids, and nasal cavities, which are exposed to the air, have a large number of mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in close contact and conjunctival transmission without proper cleaning, disinfection and direct contact with eye, mouth, and nose. Teams headed by Lu and Xia both have shown that infectious droplets and body fluids can contaminate the human conjunctival epithelium. The respiratory virus can cause ocular complications in infected patients, which in turn lead to respiratory tract infection; thus, exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute respiratory tract infection. 44,45 Similarly, ACE2 receptors are present in human lung AT2 cells 46 ; as such, an infection can be caused by exposure to respiratory droplets as well as aerosol transmission. To reduce the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and avoid potential hospital transmission through aerosol the route, digestive endoscopy centers, fever clinics, and others have issued relevant emergency plans and management measures during the epidemic period. 47,48 3.4.2 | SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted through the digestive tract SARS-CoV-2 must bind to ACE2 receptors to cause infection. Accordingly, Zhang et al 46 explored the infection pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of ACE2 in the digestive system after identifying the cell composition and proportion of expression of ACE2 in normal human lung and the gastrointestinal system through single-cell transcription.",

Guan et al 18 isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the urine of a COVID-19 patient. This suggests that viral nucleic acids may persist in bodily fluids, secretions, and excreta of patients with COVID-19, and that the digestive tract is a potential route of transmission. Viral nucleic acids may also be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, pleural effusions, and additional specimens from patients with COVID-19 in the future. A study by Cai et al 30 revealed that viral RNA from feces of children with COVID-19 was detected at a high rate, and the detoxification period can be as long as 2 to 4 weeks. Xu et al performed nucleic acid testing on anal swabs from 10 children with COVID-19 and found that the duration of positivity in anal swabs and intestinal detoxification was longer. The longest time for the nucleic acid test to change from positive to negative in anal swabs from 10 children was 51 days; the time for a throat swab nucleic acid test in these 10 children to change from positive to negative was generally 1 week. At the same time, this study demonstrated that anal swab testing in children may be more useful than nasopharyngeal swab testing in determining the effectiveness of treatment and determining the timing of quarantine termination.51 However, there was no direct evidence of fecal-oral transmission because the study did not capture live viruses.",

At the same time, the density of mortality was calculated using the number of deaths in diagnosed cases/cumulative number of days observed in diagnosed cases.

A few children do not exhibit fever, but only manifest cough or diarrhea, and even fewer can be asymptomatic carriers. Some children and newborns exhibit atypical symptoms, manifested as vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, or only asthma and shortness of breath. 10,58 The first severe case of childhood infection reported in Wuhan, China, started with gastrointestinal symptoms, exhibited no obvious early respiratory manifestations, but progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 21 According to clinical characteristics of existing pediatric cases, children with COVID-19 can be divided into five clinical types: asymptomatic infection, mild, common, severe, and critically severe. 11 One published study reported that among 134 children diagnosed, 89 exhibited fever (high fever [n = 11], low and medium fever [n = 17], and unknown [n = 61]), and 28 exhibited no fever.
