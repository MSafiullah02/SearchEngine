The basic idea of modern drug design is to search chemical compounds with desired affinity, potency, and efficacy against the biological target that is relevant to the disease of interest. However, not only that there are tens of thousands known chemical compounds existed in nature, but many more artificial chemical compounds are being produced each year [9]. Thus, the modern drug discovery pipeline is focused on narrowing down the scope of the chemical space where good drug candidates are [7, 11]. Potential lead compounds will be subjected to further experimental validation on their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic (PD/PK) properties [2, 14]; the latter includes absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) measurements. Traditionally, chemists and biologists conduct cell-based or animal-based experiments to measure the PD/PK properties of these compounds and their actual biological effects in vivo. However, these experiments are not only high cost in terms of both time and money, the experiments that involve animal testings are increasingly subjected to concerns from ethical perspectives [1].",

This kind of compounds and their isomers have highly similar structures but only slight differences in molecular geometry. Their differences cause them to possess different biological properties. For example, the drug Dopa is a compound for treating the Parkinson disease. The d-isomer form of this compound has severe toxicity whereas the l-isomer form does not [12]. Therefore, only its levorotatory form can be used for medical treatments. This property-structure relationship is often described as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and have been widely used in the prediction of different properties of compounds [4, 24]. Based on the same idea, toxicities of a compound, being one of the most concerned properties, can be predicted via computational means as a way to select more promising candidates before undertaking further biological experiments.",

Among all machine learning applications for NLP, text classification is the most widely studied. Based on the input text sentences, a machine learning-based NLP model analyzes the organization of words and the types of words in order to categorize the given text. Two pioneering NLP methods are textCNN [6] and ConvNets [26]. The former method introduced a pretrained embedding layer to encode words of input sentences into fixed-size feature vectors with padding. Then, feature vectors of all words were combined to form a sentence matrix that was fed into a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This work was considered a breakthrough at that time and accumulated over 5800 citations since 2014 (as per Google Scholar). Another spotlight paper in NLP for text classification is ConvNets [26]. Instead of analyzing words in a sentence, this model exploited simple one-hot encoding method at the character level for 70 unique characters in sentence analysis. The success of these methods in NLP shed lights to other applications that have only texts as raw data.",

The best AUC score in TOX21 challenge is 0.846 which is achieved by DeepTox [10]. Despite of its higher accuracy, the DeepTox model is extremely complex. It requires heavy feature engineering from a large pool of static and dynamic features derived from the compounds or indirectly via external tools.

For ST-DNN [23], they combined 700 element specific topological descriptors (ESTD) and 330 auxiliary descriptors as candidates to generate the feature vectors for prediction (our model uses only 56 features). In addition, their model included ensemble of two different types of classifiers, namely, deep neural network (DNN) and gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT). Combining predictions from several classifiers is an easy way to improve prediction accuracy, however, the complexity introduced into the model makes the already \"black box model\" more difficult to understand. For the recent DT+SNN model [5], they used decision trees (DT) to select 817 different descriptors generated from the PaDEL tools [25]. Although their shallow neural network (SNN) architecture required short model training time, more time was spent on feature generation and selection. Different combination of features were used depending on the tasks to be predicted, which had high computational cost. Here, BESTox has achieved results comparable to these more complex models with simple binary features and model architecture, showing the power of our method.",

Inspired by NLP techniques for text classification, we have designed a simple character-level encoding method for SMILES called the binary-encoded SMILES (BES).

The idea of multitask technique is to train a model with multiple training sets; each set corresponds to one toxicity prediction task. Feeding the learners with different toxicity data helps them to learn common latent features of molecules offered by different datasets.",
