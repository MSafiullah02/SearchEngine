Their presentation deserves significant qualification.",

It is a matter of fact that, in many tropical areas, chloroquine is used as a symptomatic treatment of febrile illnesses and thus, the health authorities had to face its actual\u2014non\u2010evaluated\u2014use during the acute phase of Chikungunya disease. The (confusing) reasons why a part of the local population utilized chloroquine also possibly included the fact that immunomodulatory effects of chloroquine have been used for a long time in autoimmune and rheumatological diseases [Cooper and Magwere, 2008], including chronic Chikungunya arthritis [Brighton, 1984].",

Sourisseau et al. [2007] reported that chloroquine inhibited potently the appearance of CHIKV\u2010positive cells and CHIKV\u2010associated cytopathic effect and noted that the therapeutic (antiviral) index of chloroquine in cell cultures is rather narrow and thus, one should be cautious when proposing the use of chloroquine as an antiviral treatment in infected individuals.",

In this double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled randomized trial, 27 patients (diagnosed within <48 hr) received chloroquine and 27 other patients received a placebo treatment. The chloroquine treatment consisted of 600 mg at day 1, 600 mg at days 2 and 3, and 300 mg at days 4 and 5 (and not 250 mg daily as reported by Savarino et al. [2007]).

Whilst in vitro inhibition of CHIKV replication is strongly established, the narrow therapeutic index and the absence of obvious biological or clinical improvement during a clinical trial do not argue in favor of a curative use in non\u2010complicated cases. Whether chloroquine may be useful as a prophylactic treatment, or in the case of severe, sustained Chikungunya infections deserves further investigations that could take advantage of the availability of a relevant non\u2010human primate animal model [Labadie et al., 2010].",
