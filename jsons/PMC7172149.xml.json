We have also recently reported the viral cause of acute wheezing (specific clinical diagnoses were not reported) in 259 hospitalized children.2, 3 Of these 259 children, 40 had acute asthma that fulfilled the criteria of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.4 The median age of the asthmatic children was 2.4 years (range, 9 months to 11 years), and 65% of them were boys. Thirty-seven (93%) children had symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection (ie, runny nose, fever, or both). Virus culture, virus antigen detection, PCR techniques (for 16 viruses), and serologic testing were used. A potential causative agent was identified in 38 (95%) patients (\nTable I). Among them, the results of PCR were positive for 1 or more viruses in 93%, virus culture in 28%, virus antigen detection in 18%, and virus serology in 33%. Rhinovirus, enteroviruses, parainfluenza viruses, and human bocavirus were the most common viruses. All 7 patients with human bocavirus had low virus genome copy numbers (<104 copies/mL), and in no case was bocavirus detected in serum, which might suggest long-term virus carriage rather than symptomatic infection.3 No patients with positive results for influenza A virus, metapneumovirus, or coronaviruses were found, as also reported by Khetsuriani et al.1 Interestingly, 2 or more viruses were detected in 43% of the children compared with 7% in the study by Khetsuriani et al.1\n",
