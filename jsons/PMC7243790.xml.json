            "text": "The chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used as frontline drug for treatment and prophylaxis against all types of human malaria worldwide. Not only malaria, but also the drugs have been used and tested against several pathophysiological conditions like hepatic amoebiasis, lupus erythematosus, light-sensitive skin eruptions, and rheumatoid arthritis [3,4]. There are plenty of studies in in vitro and in vivo against different cancers by monotherapy or combination therapy of CQ. Intraperitoneal administration of CQ at 60 mg/kg/day for seven days prolonged tumour growth in mice with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-over expressing glioblastoma xenografts [5]. In another study on glioblastoma xenograft mouse, intracranial 5\u00b5l of a 30mM/day CQ treatment for 17 days significantly reduced the mitotic cells with apoptotic cell number increases through the p53 pathway of apoptotic induction [6,7]. To support its anticancer regimen, several clinical studies on chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as anti-cancer or anti-tumour drugs, are currently being undertaken (https://clinicaltrials.gov). Chloroquine has been found to act as an anti-tumour as well as an anticancer agent [8] and further indicating that chloroquine supplementation with conventional treatments on glioblastoma patients might improve the mid-term survival of these patients. Another study has found that chloroquine diminishes intratumoural hypoxia [9] as a result making the cancer cell more sensitive for radiotherapy or other oxygen-dependent therapies [10] and for dominant metastasis. It is documented that autophagy promotes many cancers [11]. Autophagy occurs in cells under several conditions. This degradative process forms auto phagosome that retains degraded cell components, which then fuse with lysosomes to be recycled. It is understood that autophagy is halted by chloroquine by disrupting the energy source of the autophagy pathway [12,13]. Despite the inhibition of the autophagic flux of CQ and HCQ against cancer, another study has reported that these drugs affect the Toll-like receptor 9, p53 and CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway in cancer cells. In addition, in the tumour stroma, CQ affects the tumour vasculature, cancer-associated fibroblasts and the immune system [7].",

Besides such immune modulation by chloroquine, in a combination therapy against drug resistant Candida albicans, chloroquine has shown promising effects by inhibiting biofilm formation at low concentrations [17].",

The severity of the disease is for massively causing alveolar damage, with respiratory failure and consequently death [2]. However, no pathology has been reported due to barely accessible autopsy or biopsy of affected patients [2]. Every country in the world is exhaustively trying to get a cure or preventative measures against this virus. At present, all treatments are symptomatic and supportive.

            "text": "Chloroquine (known as chloroquine phosphate), a 4-amino-quinoline, was introduced in 1945 as medicine against malaria. Hans Andersag and co-workers at the Bayer laboratories discovered it in 1934. It is a weak base drug and exists in protonated and unprotonated forms. Before it, quinine from cinchona tree bark was natural antimalarial agent. In 1891, Paul Ehrlich's group chemically synthesized CQ with methylene blue, a dye, which can kill malaria parasite selectively. Through the chemistry work and the structure activity relationships (SARS) by change of the basic methyl group, resulted in a more effective antimalarial agent, pamaquine. Subsequently, the attachment of the basic side chain of pamaquine to several different heterocyclic ring systems resulted in the synthesis of an acridine derivative quinacrine, which has an extra benzene ring. Further research resulted in the discovery of two chloroquine analogues, sontoquine and primaquine, which were improved and better antimalarial drugs [19]. Studies on these compounds then lead to the discovery of resochin. During World War II, investigations on resochin lead to synthesis CQ. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, a derivative of CQ, was first synthesized in 1946 by introducing a hydroxyl group into CQ and was demonstrated to be much less (\u223c40%) toxic than CQ in animals [20,4] (Fig. 1\n). It is also believed that HCQ has less blood \u2013 retinal barrier permeability and is less toxic to retina than CQ [21,22].",

The inhibition of glycosylation results in the host developing adaptive immune response against the infection [52, 48] and impair the cellular receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-1 and blocks the fusion with the host cell [53, 22].

In another study, Gautret et al.

Based on context details from a clinical trial of China (ChiCTR2000029741) (14), 50% efficacy of chloroquine phosphate (five days drugs) was observed in COVID-19 compared to 20% efficacy from lopinavir / ritonavir combinatorial (five days drugs) in Chinese patients with pneumonia [71]. Huang et al. [72] found in clinical study that chloroquine-treated patients (500 mg orally, 10 days twice daily) are better off than patients treated with lopinavir / ritonavir. Consequently, chloroquine-treated patients have already been released from the hospital. Another clinical trial, conducted with hundred chinese patients with COVID 19 infection, reported that CQ phosphate had remarkable result both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance comparing to control group [73]. The Gao et al. [73] also reported that the drug \u2018was effective in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging, a virus-negative and shortening the activity against COVID-19 infection. They recommended the drug for adding in guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumonia caused by COVID-19\u2019 [74].",

At the time of their reporting, the overall fatality rate across both arms of the study was 13.5%. They are indicating that the percentage of fatality rate was overlapping with the patients, not taking CQ [75]. Ehud Chorin et al. [76], from New York University's Langone Medical Center, in their study of 84 adults patients with SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/ azythromycine (HCQ/AZ) combinations found a statistically significant change in the QT prolongation from baseline in 30% of the patients and QT increased by more than 40 ms and 11% of the patients had their QT increase by greater than 500 ms. They conclude that these patients represented a high risk group for arrhythmia. They further concluded that the development of renal failure in these patients was a course of the extreme QT prolongation.

The analysis looked at two primary outcomes, which were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. The authors of this study concluded that they found no evidence of the efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination with AZ. They found that mortality was higher in patients receiving HCQ alone (27.8 %) and in combination of HCQ+AZ (22.1%) while significantly lower in the group receiving no drug treatment (11.4%) [77]. According to the authors they found association of mortality in patients treated with HCQ alone.

However, with new evidence coming out, there is need for precautionary measure to be taken not to rush in recommending the CQ/HCQ for use for COVID-19 patients. We need to wait for results that would come out of larger prospective, randomized, dose determining controlled clinical trials before making clinical recommendations for HCQ and indicating it for COVID-19.
