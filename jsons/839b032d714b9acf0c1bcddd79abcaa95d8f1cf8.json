In 2002-2003, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, caused a pandemic of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the SARS epidemic, two additional HCoVs have been identified, HCoV-NL-63 and HCoV-HKU1. HCoV-NL-63 has been isolated from pediatric cases of respiratory disease and HCoV-HKU1 has been isolated from two adult patients with pneumonia. 3 Coronaviruses also cause respiratory diseases in other species, including porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), 4 respiratory bovine coronavirus (BCoV-Resp), 5 and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV). 6 Two strains of rat coronavirus (RCoV) cause respiratory disease in rats. Sialodacryoadenitis virus (RCoV-SDAV) and Parker's rat coronavirus (RCoV-P) have both been isolated from infected rat lungs. We are studying the pathogenesis of RCoVs as a model for coronavirus respiratory disease in the natural host.",

These mutations resulted in 22 amino acid changes in the S1 region that might affect receptor binding and 9 amino acid changes in the S2 region that might affect cell fusion. The functions of the S glycoprotein of murine coronavirus MHV have been studied extensively. 16 The S proteins of MHV strains are 79-90% identical in amino acid sequence with RCoV-P and RCoV-SDAV. Four of the amino acids that were changed in RCoV-P as compared with RCoV-SDAV are shared with the non-fusogenic MHV-2 (NCBI #AF201929). These 4 amino acids may be important for the non-fusogenic phenotype of MHV-2 and the delayed fusogenic phenotype of RCoV-P. In particular, amino acid 750, which is located near the S1/S2 cleavage signal sequence, may be important in S1/S2 cleavage and the subsequent ability of spike to mediate cell-cell fusion. Hingley et al. previously showed that substitution of the MHV-A59 cleavage signal with the corresponding amino acids of MHV-2 resulted in less efficient cleavage of S1/S2 and a delayed fusion phenotype. 17 The spike glycoprotein of RCoV-SDAV grown in L2P41.a cells is completely cleaved into 90-kDa S1 and S2 proteins, while RCoV-P spike is only partially cleaved. 13 Like MHV-2, RCoV-P has a threonine at amino acid 750, while RCoV-SDAV has an isoleucine. We hypothesize that changing the isoleucine 750 to threonine in the RCoV-SDAV spike would result in decreased efficiency of spike cleavage and cell fusion. Alternatively, other amino acid changes in the spike of RCoV-P may contribute to the delayed fusion phenotype seen in RCoV-Pinfected cells. The specific amino acids in spike that are important in the delayed cell to cell fusion phenotype of RCoV-P will be studied further. ",

ACE-2, the principal receptor for SARS-CoV, is expressed in both type I and type II pneumocytes. 18 CD209L, which has been identified as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV, 19 is also expressed in type I and type II pneumocytes. SARS-CoV RNA and antigen have been detected in alveolar epithelial cells of fatal SARS cases 20, 21 and in type I pneumocytes in infected macaques. 22 Type I pneumocytes make up the majority of the epithelial surface area of the lung. Damage to type I cells interferes with gas exchange and fluid homeostasis. Injury to type I cells causes type II cells to dedifferentiate, proliferate, migrate, and trans-differentiate into type I cells to repair the damaged lung. A virus that can infect both type I and type II cells, like RCoV, could cause severe lung disease by preventing repair of the damaged epithelium. Type II cells are essential for the secretion of surfactant, which stabilizes the alveoli and prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome, and surfactant proteins that are important mediators of innate immunity. Alveolar epithelial cells elicit innate and acquired immune responses in the lung by secretion of specific cytokines and chemokines. The effects of virus infection on the immune response will be addressed in future studies.",
