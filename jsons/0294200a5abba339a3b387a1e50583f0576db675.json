Loss of ACE2 leads to an age-dependent cardiomyopathy [1] [2] [3] and kidney disease [4] while also enhancing pulmonary [5] , cardiac [6] and renal injuries [7] . In addition to its peptidase action, ACE2 also functions as the receptor for the 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [8] [9] [10] and ACE2 expression is necessary for the pulmonary infection by SARS-CoV [10] [11] [12] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly through the world leading to significant morbidity and acute, often lethal, lung failure with a mortality of approximately 10% despite modern-day therapies [11, 12] . In Toronto, the SARS outbreak was associated with loss of lives, considerable burden on the healthcare system and a huge economic impact [13] [14] [15] .",

Interestingly, patients infected with the SARS-CoV suffered from cardiac disease including systolic and diastolic dysfunction [17] , arrhythmias and sudden death [18] . We hypothesized that the interaction between SARS-CoV and ACE2 in the heart could contribute to SARS-mediated myocardial inflammation and damage. We showed that pulmonary infection with the SARS-CoV in mice leads to myocardial SARS-CoV in an ACE2-dependent manner coupled with down-regulation of the myocardial Ace2 mRNA and loss of ACE2 protein. In patients who died from SARS, presence of SARS-CoV in the heart was associated with greater macrophage infiltration and myocardial damage in association with decreased myocardial ACE2 protein expression. Our results demonstrate that ACE2 plays a key role in mediating SARS-CoV infection in the heart, which in combination with down-regulation of the myocardial ACE2 could be the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of SARS-associated heart disease.",

We examined the myocardial response to pulmonary infection with the SARS-CoV. Within 2 days following SARS-CoV infection, there was a marked presence of the SARS-CoV in the heart of wild-type (Ace2+ \u2044 y) mice, while SARS-CoV levels were reduced in the hearts of Ace2) \u2044 y mice providing the first evidence for dependence of myocardial SARS-CoV infection on ACE2 expression (Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, this process lead to a partial down-regulation of Ace2 mRNA expression in wild-type mice (Fig. 1b) in association with a complete loss of myocardial ACE2 protein levels (Fig. 1c,d) . These results show that in a well-validated pulmonary murine model of SARS [10] , SARS-CoV can clearly infect the heart and modulate ACE2 expression. To decipher whether the effects on ACE2 expression is mediated directly by SARS-CoV vs. a secondary myocarditis process, we studied the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus-induced murine model of viral myocarditis. Consistent with the impact of SARS-CoV on myocardial Ace2 mRNA expression, EMC viral myocarditis was associated with a significant decrease in Ace2 mRNA (Fig. 1e) . In contrast, myocardial ACE2 protein levels showed a significant increase (Fig. 1f,g) suggesting an increased transcriptional efficiency of Ace2 mRNA and \u2044 or reduced proteolytic processing of ACE2. These results demonstrate that pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV in our murine model leads to myocardial SARS-CoV in an ACE2-dependent manner in association with decreased myocardial Ace2 mRNA expression and a specific reduction in myocardial ACE2 protein levels.",

Given the high expression of ACE2 in the heart [1, 24] coupled with the observation that SARS-CoV is detectable in the plasma of SARS patients [12, 25] , we examined whether pulmonary SARS-CoV infection leads to myocardial SARS-CoV infection in patients who died from SARS. We examined the archived postmortem autopsy heart tissues from patients who had succumbed to the SARS crisis for the evidence of myocardial SARS-CoV infection. Twenty patients, all of whom had confirmed diagnoses of SARS with SARS-CoV being detected in their lungs, were studied. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that 35% of the patients (7 of 20) had positive SARS-CoV genome detected in the heart (Fig. 2a) with an average viral load of 4AE07 \u00b7 10 6 copies of SARS-CoV per gram of heart tissue (age: 70 \u00b1 12 years; 3M \u2044 4F). Importantly, the duration of the illness was significantly shortened in patients with detectable SARSCoV in their hearts (n = 7; 3AE9 \u00b1 2AE3 days) vs. patients without SARS-CoV in the heart (n = 13; 43AE2 \u00b1 9AE7 days) (P < 0AE05) (Fig. 2a) .

In this study, we have provided evidence that ACE2 functions as the myocardial SARS-CoV receptor in vivo. Respiratory SARS-CoV infection in our murine model leads to an ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV infection in the heart and decreased myocardial Ace2 mRNA expression. Cytokine-mediated transcriptional down-regulation of Ace2 mRNA could have lead to decreased Ace2 mRNA level in SARS-CoV and EMC-mediated viral myocarditis [26] . Virusmediated receptor down-modulation has been described for multiple viruses including HIV, measles and pulmonary SARS-CoV [10] . The complete loss of ACE2 protein in hearts infected with SARS-CoV could be secondary to the activation of ADAM-17 \u2044 TACE by the SARS spike protein, which is known to cleave and release ACE2 [27] and \u2044 or due to SARS-CoV binding to ACE2 in the endothelial cells leading to endocytosis of the ligand \u2044 receptor complex [12, 28] and subsequent intracellular degradation of ACE2.",

We showed that patients who had SARS-CoV in their hearts died considerably earlier suggesting that myocardial SARS-CoV infection was associated with a more aggressive course of illness. SARS-CoV interaction with ACE2 led to SARS-associated cardiomyopathy and likely contributed signif- icantly to the morbidity and mortality in patients with SARS [17, 18] . Consistent with the cardiac disease in patients who succumbed to SARS, we previously reported that bilateral pulmonary oedema in association with bilateral pleural effusions was frequently observed at the time of autopsy [22] . Increased myocardial interstitial fibrosis in patients with SARS-CoV in the heart is consistent with recent findings showing that the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein potentiates transforming growth factor-beta-mediated fibrosis [29] . Consistent with observations in lung tissue from patients affected by SARS [23] , CD 68 positive macrophages were detected in SARS-positive hearts with an absence of lymphocytic invasion. In contrast to classic viral myocarditis as seen with the enteroviruses and herpesvirus type 6, which are associated with a prominent lymphocytic infiltration [30] , SARS-CoV-induced myocardial inflammation is mediated predominantly by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines [23, 31] .",

Myocardial dysfunction could also be secondary to the strong interferon-mediated immunopathological events associated with the immune response in patients with SARS [31, 32] . The cardiovascular involvement could explain the marked age dependence of mortality seen in patients with SARS [11, 12] because of decreased cardiovascular reserve with ageing. Consistent with ACE2 being a key SARS-CoV receptor, patients with diabetes mellitus in whom ACE2 expression is increased [7] showed greater susceptibility to SARS [13, 14] . Our results imply that interactions between infectious agents with key receptor \u2044 signalling pathways in the cardiovascular system may confer unique sensitivity to SARS-CoV and potentially other viral infections. Indeed, interaction and subsequent activation of the PI3K signalling by influenza A virus are an important determinant of viral replication and may lead to adverse cardiovascular effects in the setting of an avian influenza epidemic [33] .",
