            "text": "A coronavirus, an RNA virus, has been identified in humans as the pathogen responsible for the recent worldwide Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Rapid study of the critical SARS enzymes will provide useful inhibitors for this disease as well as a methodology that may be applicable to fight emerging pathogens in the future. The necessity of this rapid approach is further justified by the fact that the SARS virus reservoir has not been identified and future viral outbreaks are still possible. Indeed, new cases have already been reported in 2004.1 The SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome is a positive strand of RNA with 11 open reading frames and a genomic organization similar to other coronaviruses. However, phylogenic analysis and sequence alignments have shown that the SARS CoV has developed distinctly from other coronaviruses.2 The viral replication proceeds via synthesis of a complementary minus strand RNA using the genome as a template and the subsequent synthesis of genomic plus strand RNA from the minus strand RNA template. The key enzyme responsible for both steps is the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), represented by nonstructural protein 12 (nsP12). Since RdRp activity is not essential for the host, its inhibition will not cause undesirable side effects during therapy. With the enzyme characterization in its early stages, a homology model based on the amino acid sequence can provide some clues concerning the residues critical for its function. We have built a homology model of the SARS polymerase using the 3D jury system.3 Recently, during preparation and revision of this study, Xu et al.4 reported an RdRp model using the program Modeller. Although their and our models have been built using a different approach, the r.m.s between the two models is about 1.6 \u00c5 (for C\u03b1 atoms). The similarity between the two models can be partially explained by the fact that the 3D\u2010jury system uses a set of prediction methods that includes the Pcons method on which the Modeller program is based on. The capability of the 3D\u2010jury in using consensus between Meta prediction methods makes it a very reliable tool for model building as proven by its highest ranking in the CASP5 (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) competition.5 This predictor has been used recently to successfully assign a methyl\u2010transferase function to nsP13 and to build a 3D model that identified residues critical for the enzyme function.6 Substrate and ligand docking in the active site were carried out with the Genetic Optimization Ligand Docking Program (Gold) giving us an estimate of ligand binding in the active site. This docking method, with a success rate of around 70% through its validation process, proved to be very reliable when used with caution.7\n",

However, as this did not yield any significant results, we then used a more powerful consensus structure prediction method (meta\u2010predictor), the 3D\u2010jury system. We submitted the sequence to the 3D\u2010jury Meta predictor system. All models with a 3D\u2010jury score higher than 50 are considered to be significant. A three\u2010dimensional model for the SARS nsP12 comprising 474 residues was built based on the homologous rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus RdR polymerase9 (pdb ID: 1KHW_B), which had a 3D\u2010jury score of 165. The final model was built using the GIGSAW program10 and its potential energy minimized using the GROMOS96 program.11 The model quality was evaluated with Procheck12 and then analyzed. The pdb ID for the model is 1SXF. Ligand docking in the active site was carried out with the Genetic Optimization Ligand Docking program (Gold).7 The ChemScore13 and \u0394Gbinding were evaluated to discriminate between ligands. The ChemScore value is obtained by adding a clash penalty and internal torsion terms to \u0394Gbinding, which militate against close contacts in docking and poor internal conformation.13\n",

The power of this method is illustrated by the fact that even with less than 10% sequence identity, the Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) RdR polymerase,9 was identified as a homologous structure, based on a combination of motif search, fold recognition, and structure\u2010based alignment orchestrated by the 3D\u2010Jury Meta server. The RdRp function was assigned to a C\u2010terminal segment of 537 residues out of the nsP12 932 residues with a highly significant score (3D\u2010jury score > 164 in our work). No characteristic motifs suggesting specific functions were found for the 396 N\u2010terminal residues. Subsequently, a three\u2010dimensional structure for the nsP12 SARS RdRp (residues 395 to 870) was built based on the homologue's structure. Our model has 78% of residues in the favored region of Ramachandran plot and the proportion reaches 98.8% when we consider residues in the allowed regions.",

The finger domain is composed of three helices (residues 462\u2013477, 561\u2013584, and 619\u2013637), the RdRp characteristic helix\u2010loop\u2010helix (residues 619\u2013658), and two stranded \u03b2\u2010sheets (residues 535\u2013541and 551\u2013560). The palm domain consists of two helices (residues 687\u2013706 and 776\u2013793) and the \u03b2\u2010hairpin (residues 755\u2013769) that contain the catalytic aspartates 760 and 761 responsible for the nucleotide transfer reaction. This domain contains the conserved \u201cSDD\u201d sequence in the RdRPs.14 The thumb domain consists essentially of two \u03b1\u2010helices (residues 833\u2013843 and 854\u2013869) and a large loop between residues 798\u2013818. The thumb and finger domains are interconnected with loops running between them, as is the case for the Hepatitis C virus15 and RHDV RdRps.6 The active site is buried in the center of the protein. It has an architecture very similar to other RdRps [Fig. 1(B)]. We can identify all of the important residues by sequence homology. Sequence alignment of the SARS\u2010CoV polymerase with other known coronavirus polymerases showed a complete conservation of the basic residues (K545, R553, R555, and K551) and aspartates 760 and 761.16 These aspartate residues are responsible for the coordination of the metal ion involved in the nucleotidyl transfer reaction.9 In addition, residue R836, which is partially conserved in RdRp, contributes to nucleoside binding by making a hydrogen bond with the O4 of the cytidine moiety.",
