Rather, the examination for splenomegaly is most useful to rule in the diagnosis of splenomegaly among patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of at least 10%. The examination should always start with percussion. If no dullness is detected on percussion, there is no need to palpate as the results of palpation will not effectively rule in or rule out splenic enlargement. If the possibility of missing splenic enlargement remains an important clinical concern, then ultrasound or scintigraphy is indicated. In the presence of percussion dullness, palpation should follow. If both tests are positive, the diagnosis of splenomegaly is established (providing the clinical suspicion of splenomegaly was at least 10% before examination).

If MALT persists for over 8-12 months, should consider single-agent chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) or involvedfield radiation. Partial gastrectomy may be needed for hemorrhage or perforation ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LYMPHOMA \u00b7 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY -continuum of presentation with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Considered lymphoma if < 5% blasts in bone marrow; otherwise, considered leukemia \u00b7 CLINICAL FEATURES -usually mediastinal mass in young males BURKITT'S LYMPHOMA \u00b7 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY -t(8;14, 2;8, 8;22) leading to c-myc overexpression \u00b7 CLINICAL FEATURES -usually advanced stage (80-90%). Abdominal mass, CNS, breast/ovarian involvement, and nodal sites but mediastinum usually spared TESTICULAR LYMPHOMA \u00b7 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY -60% primary testicular lymphoma, 40% spread from other sites.

EBVnegative PTLD present later and are more aggressive than EBV-positive PTLD. Mostly B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and very rarely T-cell or NK cell lymphomas \u00b7 RISK FACTORS -high degree of immunosuppression, pre-transplant EBV negativity. Risk highest in the first year, then reduces by 80% \u00b7 CLINICAL FEATURES -clinical spectrum includes reactive plasmacytic hyperplasia (55%, infectious mononucleosis like illness with no malignant transformation), polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia (30%, polyclonal cytogenetic abnormalities, immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, and disruption of underlying tissue architecture), and B-or T-cell lymphomas (15%, monoclonal malignancy) \u00b7 TREATMENTS -reduction in immunosuppression ( ",

Note that transplant is not affected by differences in ABO blood groups \u00b7 HLA CLASS I -HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C \u00b7 HLA CLASS II -HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP MATCHING PROCESS -ensure good match of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, DRB1, and DQB1. The chance of finding a sibling match is 1-0.75 n , where n = number of siblings. The chance of finding a matched unrelated donor is >60%, higher for Caucasians and lower for other races. Search for a match typically takes 3-4 months CONDITIONING -goal is to eradicate malignancy and suppress recipient's immune system to minimize rejection of donor's stem cells. Myeloablative regimens include cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation (TBI) or high-dose busulfan. Reduced intensity regimens include fludarabine plus busulfan. Reduced intensity (also known as non-myeloablative or \"mini\" transplant) regimens use a milder conditioning regimen more tolerable for older patients (e.g. fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, melphalan).

Consider oocyte/sperm/embryo cryopresevation \u00b7 SECOND MALIGNANCIES -increased incidence of solid tumors (bone, oropharynx, connective tissue, CNS, thyroid, melanoma), myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and lymphoproliferative disorders.

Defined as ANC >0.5 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL, with platelet and RBC engraftment following. GCSF may be used in non-leukemic patients to accelerate engraftment by up to 1 week. Patient is supported with blood products and antimicrobial prophylaxis (e.g. ciprofloxacin for Gram negatives, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PJP, acyclovir for HSV, fluconazole for fungal agents) until engraftment occurs. Failure to engraft (primary graft failure) and irreversible decline of blood counts (secondary graft failure) are serious complications (<5%). For non-myeloablative transplant, perform chimerism analysis and consider either donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) or reducing immunosuppression to improve disease control IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION -restoration of T-cell and B-cell immunity takes up to 12 months. Immunosuppressive treatment can usually be stopped within 1-3 years post-allogeneic transplant. Graft vs. host disease (GVHD) is a donor T-cell-mediated process.
