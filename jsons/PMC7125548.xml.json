            "text": "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides an objective, noninvasive global assessment of the integrated physiologic response to exercise. A major advantage over other objective measures of exercise capacity (eg, 6MWT) is that it provides information that may identify cardiac, respiratory, or musculoskeletal contributions to any exercise limitation present. The anaerobic threshold (AT) is an objective measure of functional or aerobic capacity that normally occurs at 50% to 60% of peak exercise capacity. Importantly and unlike peak oxygen consumption (peak Vo\n2), it is less influenced by either learning effect or patient effort. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is advocated as a tool to guide exercise prescription in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure [6], [7]. To date, its use after critical illness has been restricted to the study of specific patient populations including survivors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [8], [9]. To our knowledge, CPET has never been used in the assessment of general adult ICU survivors in the immediate post\u2013hospital discharge period. The purpose of our study was therefore 2-fold:1.To determine the feasibility and safety of CPET as a tool for the objective assessment of exercise capacity in unselected adult general ICU survivors.2.To help to further characterize the pathophysiology of any exercise limitation present in this patient population.\n",

Peripheral oxygen saturations (Spo\n2) and noninvasive blood pressure were monitored throughout the test. After a period of observation at rest to allow the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) to plateau (typically 1-3 minutes), subjects completed 3 minutes of unloaded cycling at 60 revolutions per minute. Load was then applied to the pedals in a ramp-like fashion increasing by 10 to 15 W/min until maximum exercise capacity was reached. For safety reasons, the study protocol required immediate termination of the test if the subject experienced any of the following adverse events: chest pain, altered sensorium, ST depression greater than 2 mm on the exercise electrocardiogram, and emotional distress. Two intensive care physicians with advanced life support skills were present throughout all tests. After termination of the test, subjects were monitored until cardiorespiratory parameters returned to baseline levels.",

Although the safety of CPET in this patient population has not previously been examined, it has been performed safely in other debilitated patient groups including those with advanced cancer and chronic heart failure [13], [14]. In the latter study, no deaths were reported in over 4400 tests, with a rate of major cardiovascular events of 0.45 per 1000 tests. Although not powered to detect morbidity and mortality, our study adds to the general body of evidence supporting the safety of CPET in debilitated patients.",

This is in keeping with several follow-up studies of ICU survivors where exercise capacity, measured at 3 months using the 6MWT, ranged from 49% to 80% of predicted values [1], [15], [16]. Patients displayed raised Eqco\n2 (39 \u00b1 9), suggesting inefficient gas exchange and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching. This finding has been previously documented in ICU survivors, especially those with prior ARDS [9], [17]. A raised Eqco\n2 found in the presence of a reduced AT is suggestive of pulmonary vascular disease contributing to exercise limitation. This can be secondary to cardiac disease or intrinsic lung pathology. Interestingly, only 1 of our patient cohort demonstrated significant desaturation during exercise.",

Contributing factors in this cohort might include cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary vascular changes, anemia, and impaired peripheral oxygen extraction. A number of our patients were known to have premorbid cardiac failure as documented in Table E1; because routine echocardiography was not performed as part of this study, it is not possible to further define the contribution of impaired stroke volume to the reduced oxygen pulse values seen. Patients were also anemic, with a mean hemoglobin concentration of 10.3 \u00b1 1.2 g/dL at the time of hospital discharge. The interpretation of oxygen pulse data is further confounded by the number of patients \u03b2-blocked at the time of their CPET. Rate-limiting medication can affect the results of a CPET by increasing diastolic filling time and therefore stroke volume and oxygen pulse. This effect is countered by a reduction in peak heart rate achieved and consequently the peak cardiac output and oxygen consumption achievable. Patients taking rate-limiting drugs (36%) had a significantly greater oxygen pulse than those who were not (9.8 vs 8.1 mL per beat, P = .009), although no significant difference in exercise capacity was seen.",

The commonest reason for test termination in our cohort was leg fatigue. This is in keeping with previous studies of CPET after critical illness where more than 75% of patients described leg fatigue as the main symptom limiting exercise [8]. The RER at peak exercise was 0.96 \u00b1 0.11 with both BR and HRR evident in most of the patients, indicating the presence of cardiorespiratory reserve at the peak exercise level achieved by the patient. These findings support muscle weakness and deconditioning as major contributory factors in the reduced exercise capacity seen in our patient cohort. The reduced exercise capacity evident in those patients ventilated for more than 14 days can also be explained in part by the expected increased loss of muscle mass and further deconditioning as a result of more prolonged critical illness. An objective measure of muscle strength was not an outcome measure in this study.",

This may have skewed our results, underestimating the degree of debility experienced by this population as a whole. Equally, an \u201cunhealthy volunteer\u201d effect is also a possibility, where the patients presenting are the worst affected, having failed to resume daily activities (including employment) and therefore have the time to attend.
