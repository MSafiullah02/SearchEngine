The disease primarily involves the respiratory tract [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]] but it may deteriorate to multi-organ failure and be fatal [3]. Acute respiratory complications that are reported to require prolonged ICU stays are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, and older adults and polymorbid individuals have worst outcomes and higher mortality [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. ICU stays, and particularly their longer duration, are per se well-documented causes of malnutrition, with loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which in turn may lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidities long after ICU discharge [6]. Many chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and their clustering in polymorbid individuals [7] as well as older age per se [8] are also very commonly associated with high risk and prevalence of malnutrition and worse outcomes. Causes of ICU- and disease-related malnutrition include reduced mobility, catabolic changes particularly in skeletal muscle as well as reduced food intake, all of which may be exacerbated in older adults [[6], [7], [8]]. In addition, inflammation and sepsis development may further and primarily contribute to enhance all the above alterations in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Most importantly, appropriate nutritional assessment and treatment are well-documented to effectively reduce complications and improve relevant clinical outcomes under various conditions including ICU stays, hospitalization, several chronic diseases and in older adults [[6], [7], [8]].",

GLIM proposed a two-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis, i.e., first screening to identify \u201cat risk\u201d status by the use of validated screening tools such as MUST or NRS-2002, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition (Table 1\n).

Preserving nutritional status and preventing or treating malnutrition also importantly has the potential to reduce complications and negative outcomes in patients at nutritional risk who might incur in COVID-19 in the future. In particular, COVID-19 can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea impairing food intake and absorption [2], thus a good nutritional status is an advantage for people at risk for severe COVID-19. In a recent review about potential interventions for novel coronavirus based on the Chinese experience authors suggested that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments [11].",

Among the host factors associated with variations in influenza morbidity and mortality age, cellular and humoral immune responses, genetics and nutrition played a role [11]. Malnutrition and famine were associated with high disease severity and was related to mortality also in the younger population. Undernutrition remains a problem for viral pandemics of the twenty-first century and beyond. Indeed, chronic malnutrition was thought to have contributed to the high morbidity and mortality seen in Guatemalan children during the 2009 influenza pandemic [12]. In a future virus pandemic, we might face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of malnutrition, when both undernutrition and overnutrition will promote severity of disease. It is now well accepted that obesity increases one's risk of being hospitalized with, and dying from, an influenza virus infection, and that obesity inhibits both virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses and antibody responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine [11]. The challenge for future virus pandemics is therefore not only to protect those affected by undernutrition, but also the growing number of people living with obesity [11]. This is particularly important for the WHO European Region as in many European countries obesity and overweight affects 30\u201370% of the population [14]. In a recent Japanese study, malnutrition and pneumonia were identified as the prognostic factors in influenza infection, which are amenable to medical intervention. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling with prescribed independent variables, male sex, severity score, serum albumin levels, and pneumonia were associated with survival 30 days from the onset of influenza [13].",

The presence of at least two chronic diseases in the same individual can be defined as polymorbidity and is also characterized by high nutritional risk. Older adults are at higher risk due to combinations of higher prevalence of comorbidities, aging-associated changes in body composition with gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (sarcopenia), additional factors including oral and chewing problems, psycho-social issues, cognitive impairment, low financial income. Obese individuals with chronic diseases and older age are at risk for reduced skeletal muscle mass and function and should therefore be fully included in the above recommendations. Dietary restrictions that may limit dietary intake should be avoided.

For example, vitamin A deficiency is involved in measles and diarrhea and measles can become severe in vitamin A-deficient children. In experimental models, the effect of infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a kind of coronaviruses, was more pronounced in chickens fed a diet marginally deficient in vitamin A than in those fed a diet adequate in vitamin A [25]. In addition, it has been reported that vitamin A supplementation in humans reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrheal disease, measles-related pneumonia, malaria and HIV/AIDS infection. To this regard, the COVID-19 pandemic has further raised the question of how the infection may impact people living with HIV/AIDS. Where the HIV/AIDS is well managed with adequate treatment, the risk of complications of COVID-19 does not increase. However, in many parts of the world, people living with HIV/AIDS receive sub-optimal treatment and are more likely to have severe complications. There is evidence that ensuring food and nutrition security for all, but particularly for people living with HIV/AIDS will enhance their resistance to other infections by boosting their immunity [26]. Thus, healthy nutrition should be one of the main objectives to protect people living with HIV/AIDS from the potentially lethal consequences of COVID-19.",

However, prolonged home stay may lead to increased sedentary behaviors, such as spending excessive amounts of time sitting, reclining, or lying down for screening activities (playing games, watching television, using mobile devices); reducing regular physical activity and hence lower energy expenditure. Thus quarantine can lead to an increased risk for and potential worsening of chronic health conditions, weight gain, loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength and possibly also loss of immune competence since several studies have reported positive impact of aerobic exercise activities on immune function. In a recent paper. Chen et al. [28] conclude: \u201c\u2026 there is a strong rationale for continuing physical activity at home to stay healthy and maintain immune system function in the current precarious environment. Exercise at home using various safe, simple, and easily implementable exercises is well suited to avoid the airborne coronavirus and maintain fitness levels. Such forms of exercise may include, but are not limited to, strengthening exercises, activities for balance and control, stretching exercises, or a combination of these. Examples of home exercises include walking in the house and to the store as necessary, lifting and carrying groceries, alternating leg lunges, stair climbing, stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand using a chair and from the floor, chair squats, and sit-ups and pushups. In addition, traditional Tai Ji Quan, Qigong exercises, and yoga should be considered since they require no equipment, little space, and can be practiced at any time. The use of eHealth and exercise videos, which focuses on encouraging and delivering physical activity through the Internet, mobile technologies, and television are other viable avenues for maintaining physical function and mental health during this critical period.\u201d Under particular precautions, even outdoor activities can be considered such as garden work (if a own garden is present), garden exercise (i.e. badminton), or walking/running in the forest (alone or in small family groups while maintaining a distance of 2 m minimum to others). Every day >30 min or every second day > 1 h exercise is recommended to maintain fitness, mental health, muscle mass and thus energy expenditure and body composition.",

Individuals infected with SARS-Cov 2 outside of the ICU should therefore be treated to prevent or improve malnutrition. The oral route is always preferred when practicable. We refer to individual guidelines for optimization of calorie targets. Nutritional treatment should start early during hospitalization (within 24\u201348 h). Especially for older and polymorbid patients whose nutritional conditions may be already compromised, nutritional treatment and targets should be met gradually to prevent refeeding syndrome. ONS provide energy-dense alternatives to regular meals and may be specifically enriched to meet targets in terms of protein as well as micronutrients (vitamins and trace elements) whose daily estimated requirements should be regularly provided. When compliance is questioned, more frequent evaluation of treatment and potential indication to modify ONS could be needed (e.g. weekly). Nutritional treatment should continue after hospital discharge with ONS and individualized nutritional plans; this is particularly important since pre-existing nutritional risk factors continue to apply and acute disease and hospitalization are likely to worsen the risk or condition of malnutrition.",

It should be pointed out that airway complications may occur with longer median non-invasive ventilation duration in NIV patients treated with enteral feeding [31]. The recommendation to start enteral feeding could be impaired by the fact that placement of nasal gastric tube (NGT) for nutrition may result in 1) air leakage that may compromise the effectiveness of NIV; 2) stomach dilatation that may affect diaphragmatic function and affect NIV effectiveness [32]. The above observations may account at least in part for highly inadequate implementation of enteral nutrition which may result in patient starvation especially in the first 48 h of ICU stay and higher risk of malnutrition and related complications [33].

Loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle function may be tremendous and a major problem in ICU survivors [44]. This may particularly apply to older adults and comorbid patients that are more prone to present with pre-existing catabolic conditions and impaired skeletal muscle mass and function; in addition, these patient groups may be more presumably prone to develop more intense catabolic responses due to COVID-19 and to ICU conditions at large. Prolonged reported duration of ICU stay above two weeks for many COVID-19 patients is likely to further enhance muscle-catabolic conditions. Appropriate energy delivery avoiding overfeeding and adequate protein administration are critical to prevent this severe loss of muscle mass and function (see Statement 2 and related commentary). Although definitive guidance cannot be made on additional specific treatments potentially due to lack of high-quality studies, recent evidence seems to indicate potential positive impact of physical activity with supplemental amino acids or their metabolites [45,46].",

Ten recommendations are proposed to manage nutritional care in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1\n). At each step of the treatment, nutritional therapy should be part of patient care, with regard for older adult, frail and comorbid individuals. Optimal outcome can be improved implementing adherence to recommendations to ensure survival of this life-threatening disease as well as better and shorter recovery, particularly but not limited to the post-ICU period. A comprehensive approach associating nutrition to life-support measures has potential to improve outcomes particularly in the recovery phase.",

Also hospital procurement officers and others could consider these nutritional requirements as essential needs in resource allocation process.
