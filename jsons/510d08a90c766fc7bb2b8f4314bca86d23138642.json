            "text": "Recent decades have seen an increase in the number of patients living with cancer. This trend has resulted in an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) utilization across this population [1] . Acute respiratory failure is the most frequent medical complication leading to critical illness in oncologic patients [2] [3] [4] . Historically, there has been a reluctance to admit cancer patients to the ICU given their poor outcomes, particularly in the setting of hematologic malignancy and invasive mechanical ventilation [5] . ICU treatment limitations or refusal of admission was advocated [6] . Major advances in oncologic care, critical care and more meticulous attention to where the conditions overlap, have resulted in marked improvement in short-term survival in this population [1, 7, 8] . Despite these major advances, acute respiratory failure in this population remains complex with unique challenges surrounding diagnosis and management compared to the general ICU population. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of acute respiratory failure in the oncologic population and highlights specific considerations for the intensivist. We will focus on the important differences between the immunocompromised oncologic patient and general intensive care population, the spectrum of causes of acute respiratory failure with a specific focus on toxicities related to newer cancer therapies, diagnostic approach, management and an up-to-date overview of prognosis.",

This paradigm shift in cancer care has not been free of new challenges for the medical community. With these advances comes a higher rate of critical illness. While most oncologic admissions to the ICU are planned postsurgical admissions, the profile of those being admitted for medical indications is changing. Infectious acute respiratory failure and sepsis remain the leading causes of medical-oncologic ICU admissions; however, we are seeing a surge in elderly patients presenting with disease-or treatment-associated critical illness and unique toxicities associated with newer therapies. As oncologic care is becoming more complex with intensive regimens, newer therapies and higher volumes, certain centers are developing specialized ICUs for the management of cancer patients, recognizing a need for critical care support and expansion of oncologic critical care knowledge. Table 3 .1 highlights some of the recent advances in oncology and the critical care implications of these changes.",

We feel the key differences are associated with (1) their immunocompromised state; (2) higher risk of non-infectious causes of acute respiratory failure; and (3) potential greater risk of frailty at the time of critical illness. Oncologic patients are usually considered to be immunocompromised. This can be a result of the underlying disease (e.g., acute leukemia with functional neutropenia) or secondary to the treatment (e.g., patient with solid tumor after chemotherapy). Although the mechanisms leading to immunosuppression are different across all oncologic patients, these patients all share an increased vulnerability to develop common community-acquired and opportunistic infections. Furthermore, the underlying cause of acute respiratory failure in this population can also be noninfectious (direct involvement by the tumor or treatment-related toxicity), making the differential diagnosis even more challenging particularly when infectious/noninfectious causes occur concurrently.",

Patients with hematologic malignancies are more frequently admitted with higher acuity conditions, whereas patients with solid tumors are more frequently admitted perioperatively [4] . In the subset of solid tumor patients admitted with medical-induced critical illness, their characteristics and outcomes mirror the general ICU population to a greater degree than those with hematologic malignancies [1] . This difference is attributable to the more profound and prolonged nature of immunosuppression across the hematologic malignancies, making such patients more vulnerable to bacterial, viral and invasive fungal respiratory infections. Furthermore, patients with hematologic malignancies also face a higher risk of noninfectious respiratory complications than those with solid tumors given the heightened doses of cytoreductive/myeloablative therapies, and a higher risk of immune reconstitution reactions.",

It is theorized that it may be more common in the setting of an infectious precipitant as is seen in the HIV setting. Treatment includes consideration for corticosteroids depending upon its severity.

Recognizing and projecting the reversibility of the underlying cause is an important factor in deciding the need for monitoring, transfer for ICU admission and eventually the decision for intubation. This also needs to take into consideration the oncologic diagnosis, pending treatments and underlying prognosis. A wide spectrum of differential diagnosis should be kept in consideration, including infectious and non-infectious causes and the possibility of dual infections or concomitant infections/non-infectious etiologies. In patients with pulmonary infiltrates, laboratory studies need to be considered in light of the type and degree of immunosuppression. The work-up may include a series of non-invasive serum and sputum microbiologic tests (sputum cultures, induced sputum for P. jirovecii, CMV serum evaluation, serum galactomannan, nasopharyngeal swab for viral polymerase chain reaction, etc.); imaging modalities (computed tomography [CT] thorax, echocardiography if cardiogenic pulmonary edema is considered) and possible BAL for further microbiologic evaluation if no diagnosis has been yielded. The routine and upfront use of BAL in hypoxic oncologic immunocompromised patients with undetermined lung infiltrates is controversial. Conflicting evidence exists surrounding its safety in patients with high oxygen requirements (potentially precipitating endotracheal intubation) [27, 28] ; however, evidence has demonstrated that given the debatable diagnostic yield, a strategy of first pursuing non-invasive tests may be warranted in the appropriate population [27] . There may exist a subset of patients for whom the need for BAL as an initial diagnostic strategy is warranted at an earlier time point (e.g., to rule out extrinsic compression or pulmonary hemorrhage, or to rule out infections with potentially toxic treatment profiles). Figure 3 .1 outlines an approach to diagnosis. Finally, despite an extensive diagnostic work up, approximately 13-40% of oncologic patients have undiagnosed acute respiratory failure [4, 29] . Undiagnosed acute respiratory failure is associated with a worse prognosis. It remains unclear whether it is a disease entity within itself or occult infectious/non-infectious etiology not appropriately identified. The role of lung biopsy has been considered in this population in the setting of acute respiratory failure or ARDS, but, given the immunosuppressed state, frequent thrombocytopenia, risk of bronchopleural fistula in light of positive pressure ventilation, and morbidity and mortality with the procedure; it is not pursued frequently [30] .",

This therapy may range from antimicrobial coverage for possible infections, chemotherapy/radiation therapy for disease-induced acute respiratory failure (e.g., leukostasis or airway compression from lymphoma), or corticosteroid/anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) therapy to blunt inflammation related to possible drug toxicities. Of utmost importance is the rapid identification of cause and initiation of treatment early in the course of acute respiratory failure in order to prevent the development of ARDS or need for invasive mechanical ventilation. For disease-associated complications, such as leukostasis or tumor infiltration, historic reservations to initiate chemotherapy in the ICU have been dispelled by more recent data demonstrating its feasibility and lack of association with increased mortality [31] . While mortality rates across acute respiratory failure in this population have decreased (40-70%) [3, 7, 32] , there is a subset that continue to have an unacceptably high mortality, particularly in the setting of invasive mechanical ventilation [32, 33] . The high mortality in the face of mechanical ventilation is likely attributable to (1) more aggressive infectious organisms with a higher risk of drug resistance; (2) adverse events of appropriate antimicrobial treatments; (3) an immunocompromised state that delays eradication of the infection; (4) difficulty or delays in diagnosis; and (5) a higher risk of frailty-which may subject these patients to a higher risk of respiratory muscle weakness prolonging their recovery from critical illness. It remains unclear whether these patients are more susceptible to ventilator-associated lung injury or the harms associated with ventilator-associated lung injury. Given an increased mortality in the setting of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to the general ICU population, a subset of literature has focused on optimal strategies of non-invasive oxygen therapy to prevent intubation.",

They are often applied in the setting of severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure in an attempt to prevent the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Continuous low-flow oxygen therapy via face mask is the most common mechanism of oxygen delivery in the setting of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Its greatest limitation remains the limited inspired flow rate (up to 15 L/min). When hypoxia is combined with a high work of breathing, entrainment of ambient air (which could be liters) from around the mask may result in a dilution of the inspired oxygen to the alveoli. This results in insufficient delivery of the intended oxygen concentrations to the alveoli. Inability to provide alveolar recruitment and the risk of local oxygen toxicity (tracheobronchitis/mucociliary disturbance) are also limitations to this non-invasive strategy.",

These trials demonstrated that, in early acute respiratory failure, the application of NIV instead of continuous oxygen therapy was associated with a decreased need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. Given the limited generalizability of those historic trials to the populations we manage today, a more recent trial by Lemiale and colleagues re-evaluated this question and demonstrated no difference in outcomes between NIV and continuous oxygen therapy [36] .",

            "text": "Humidified HFNC is a novel device for oxygen delivery that allows for higher flow oxygen delivery via large bore nasal cannula (40-60 L/min of flow). Theoretic mechanisms of benefit include higher flow of inspired oxygen delivery outstripping any ambient air that could be entrained, dead space washout, a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) generated and humidification to enhance mucociliary clearance. The Florali trial by Frat and colleagues demonstrated reduced 90-day mortality with HFNC compared to NIV and continuous oxygen therapy across the general ICU population with acute respiratory failure [37] . In a post hoc analysis focusing on immunocompromised patients (excluding severe neutropenia), there were no differences with HFNC compared to continuous oxygen on rates of intubation but a persistent benefit of HFNC compared to NIV [38] . These results are intriguing as it is theorized that it may not be the HFNC per se resulting in a beneficial impact, but potentially harm induced by NIV. The median tidal volumes in the NIV arm were 9 mL/kg thus leading the authors to hypothesize that ventilator-associated lung injury could be contributing to the increased harm noted. The authors, in a subsequent study, found that a PaO 2 /FiO 2 <200 mmHg or tidal volumes \u22659 mL/kg were associated with NIV failure [39] .",

Across this cohort, 20% of patients with ARDS underwent NIV as their first line supportive management instead of invasive mechanical ventilation. Focusing on observational studies of ARDS across oncology patients, 40-50% underwent NIV as first-line [32, 33] . While the original studies evaluating the utility of NIV in immunocompromised patients focused on early acute respiratory failure and the role of NIV in preventing the need for intubation, these initial promising data has led to NIV creep into more severe subgroups of ARDS [29, 32, 33] . In an observational study by Azoulay and colleagues evaluating management and outcomes of oncologic patients with ARDS, 70% of those who underwent initial NIV, eventually failed and required invasive mechanical ventilation [32] . However, high failure rates are not consistently reported, as the failure rate noted by Rathi and colleagues was 40% [33] . Across these two studies-amongst the largest to evaluate ARDS in the oncology population-NIV failure was an independent risk factor for mortality with mortality rates higher than in patients managed with an initial strategy of invasive mechanical ventilation. Given the observational nature of these data, it remains unclear whether this increased mortality is due to unmeasured confounders, such as higher severity of illness not captured in the multivariable analysis, physician reservation to intubate based upon subtle patient factors (e.g., frailty) or whether the use of NIV was associated with higher tidal volumes resulting in greater lung injury and increased mortality in this population. On the contrary, of the 60% who did not require invasive mechanical ventilation after NIV in the study by Rathi and colleagues, their ICU mortality rates were the lowest (29%) compared to cohorts with an initial strategy of invasive mechanical ventilation (61%) and NIV failure (71%). Given the retrospective nature of these studies, future, research should focus on delineating how to identify which patient populations, if any, may benefit from a time-limited trial of NIV in the setting of ARDS. Until further research, we propose the following management algorithm to consider in oncologic patients in the setting of acute respiratory failure and ARDS (Fig. 3.2 ",

More recent up-to-date data demonstrate more favorable short-term prognoses ranging from <10% in the post-surgical oncologic patient, 30-50% in the solid or hematologic malignancy patient, to upwards of 60% across allogeneic stem cell transplant patient requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [42] [43] [44] [45] . Improved outcomes are likely attributable to better patient selection for oncologic and intensive care, advances in antimicrobial prophylaxis, infection control and antimicrobial management, earlier identification and a better understanding of the causes of acute respiratory failure and better overall supportive care with more specialized centers/units and subspecialists managing these patients. Factors consistently found to be associated with high mortality in the oncologic critically ill population include age and comorbid conditions, poor functional and frailty status, treatment refractory graft-vs-host disease in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients, NIV failure in the setting of ARDS, invasive fungal infections requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and number of organs failed evaluated after 3-5 days of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Early and routine discussions with the oncologist and patient/substitute decision makers in guiding ongoing care decisions is imperative to ensuring that the resources dedicated to the care of this patient is bridging them to a meaningful recovery or candidacy for ongoing oncologic treatment if indicated [46] . Future research should focus on advancing diagnostic strategies to delineate more precisely and rapidly the etiology of acute respiratory failure, strategies to blunt pulmonary and systemic inflammation that can result as a consequence of otherwise effective cancer therapies, the role of biomarkers in predicting the onset of acute respiratory failure, clarifying optimal non-invasive oxygen strategies and the role of NIV and finally long-term outcomes across survivors of acute respiratory failure.",

Possibly driven by higher tidal volumes Practical approach: Consider continuous oxygen therapy as first line. If high FiO2 delivery, consider HFNC to minimize risk of local oxygen toxicity. If high work of breathing, consider HFNC with a rapid re-evaluation of response of vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, FiO2 requirements) If persistent high work of breathing, consider a time-limited trial of NIV with a rapid re-evaluation of vitals + tidal volumes Invasive mechanical ventilation High flow nasal cannula Non-invasive ventilation The evidence: NIV failure in patients with ARDS associated with an increased mortality Practical approach for mild ARDS: If high severity of illness (vasopressors, dialysis, PaO2/FiO2 <150 mmHg) and full ICU in care plan, consider invasive mechanical ventilation Otherwise consider trial of HFNC. If persistent tachypnea/tachycardia or hypoxia consider NIV or IMV. If NIV chosen-re-evaluate at 1 hour tidal volumes, respiratory rate, heart rate.
