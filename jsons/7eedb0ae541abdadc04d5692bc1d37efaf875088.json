To date, no clear guidelines exist for the management of these patients in general and for hemodialysis and transplant patients in particular. 6 The pharmacological approach to treating SARS-CoV-2 infection can be viewed as a 2-phase approach. The first phase is associated with viral replication and cytopathic effect, and antiviral drugs may be considered (e.g., chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ ritonavir, darunavir ritonavir, and darunavir/cobicistat). The second phase of the disease begins after 7 to 10 days from the onset of symptoms, and is associated with the risk of death 2 ; this stage is characterized by progressive lung involvement with escalating needs of oxygen supplementation and ventilatory support, which seems to be secondary to hyperinflammatory and cytokine release syndromes.

For example, baseline characteristics suggest a higher disease severity in the treatment arm (more patients with respiratory rate >24/min, with days from onset to randomization >12 and requiring oxygen) and, interestingly, an associated higher viral load. Despite that, patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir experienced a higher proportion of clinical improvement on day 14 (45.5% vs. 30.0%), a shorter time to clinical improvement if treated within 12 days from onset (hazard ratio 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.77-2.05), and were less likely to die (19.2% vs. 25.0%, not significant).
