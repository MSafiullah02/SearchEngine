Within months, the virus had spread rapidly to thousands of people in neighboring cities and eventually crossed the oceans, extending its reach to over 100 countries worldwide.1 This disease was characterized by a wide range of symptoms ranging from dry cough, fever, fatigue, difficulty breathing, bilateral lung infiltration, severe respiratory failure, and even death.2 COVID-19 was frightening due to its high transmission rate, viral shedding, and the possibility to hide within asymptomatic carriers.2 These features greatly contributed to its expeditious circulation within the world\u2019s population. The infectious viral disease inevitably incited concerns and drove the demand for protective face masks. As the population engaged in panic buying in hopes of combating the viral infection, it soon led to shortage that might consequently jeopardize the healthcare system.3",

They cast a wide net across the globe, enabling communications, providing convenience, and giving the population the opportunity to not only meet new people but learn new things. On the other hand, mobile phones, especially smartphones, had blossomed worldwide in recent years, and they had become more capable than just sending and receiving phone calls.17 The technological advancements contributed to enhanced health surveillance levels with the potential to track calories intake, measure physical activities, estimate vital signs, calculate optimal sleep time, and so forth.17,18 Like the other health applications, the face mask applications in the current study assisted the public in locating the availability of health resources and also could serve as a reminder to protect personal health.

It could be attributed to communication difficulty and misunderstanding of human and computer-generated speeches. However, despite hearing impairment, voice control could be a much more natural interactive mode for the elderly who did not grow up with smartphones and tablets.19 However, it took time for people to overcome the unfamiliarity. Another possible reason might be that higher technological skills and expenses were required to deploy applications with voice user interface in a short time.",
