Serological studies suggest that the prototypical strains HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 cause from 15% to 30% of human upper respiratory infections or colds (Holmes, 2001). Studies on the pathogenesis of HCoV-229E respiratory infections were limited to intranasal inoculation of human volunteers because there was no small animal model. HCoV-229E infection leads to coryza, headache, cough, fever, disruption of nasal epithelium, and it can occasionally cause lower respiratory tract infection (Chilvers et al., 2001). There is in vitro and in vivo evidence for infection of cells of the central nervous system (CNS) by human coronaviruses, although no neurological symptoms have been associated with HCoV-229E infection (Arbour et al., 2000).",

When the single-stranded positive-sense genomic RNA of HCoV-229E is transfected into cells derived from many species, productive virus replication ensues and progeny virions are efficiently released (Thiel et al., 2001). Thus, hAPN plays a critical role in the tissue tropism and species specificity of HCoV-229E. For example, mouse fibroblasts that are nonpermissive for HCoV-229E become susceptible after transfection with cDNA encoding hAPN (Yeager et al., 1992). Porcine and feline coronaviruses also use aminopeptidase N (APN) as their cellular receptors (Delmas et al., 1992, Tresnan et al., 1996).",

APN is also expressed by granulocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cerebral pericytes at the blood\u2013brain barrier, synaptic membranes in the central nervous system, as well as on antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (Dong et al., 2000, Noren et al., 1997, Riemann et al., 1999). The biological activities of APN include the removal of individual amino acids from amino-termini of small peptides in the lumen of the small intestine, cleavage of peptides bound to MHC class II molecules on antigen presenting cells, angiogenic regulation, and degradation of neurotransmitters at synaptic junctions (Bhagwat et al., 2003, Noren et al., 1997, Riemann et al., 1999). Human APN is also a marker for acute myeloid leukemia and plays a role in tumor invasion (Riemann et al., 1999).",

Therefore, we developed mice transgenic for hAPN, and tested these animals, or primary cells isolated from them, for susceptibility to HCoV-229E. The hAPN transgene was designed to be expressed in the epithelial cells of respiratory and intestinal tracts where coronaviruses enter the host. The human APN operon has two promoters separated by more than 8 Kb and they direct the differential expression of hAPN mRNA in various tissues (Shapiro et al., 1991). The transgene was engineered to use the proximal human APN promoter, active in epithelial cells of the intestine, lung, liver, and kidney (Shapiro et al., 1991), to direct the transcription of hAPN cDNA and the polyadenylation signal from SV40 virus (Fig. 1\n). Eight lines of mice were produced by pronuclear microinjection and hAPN expression was analyzed. This study focuses on a single line of mice that expressed the highest levels of hAPN mRNA and protein in a variety of tissues. This hAPN transgenic line of mice, and cells derived from these animals, were tested for susceptibility to HCoV-229E.",

FACS analysis with anti-hAPN MAb-WM15 showed that 29% of the G418 resistant co-transfected cell population expressed hAPN on the cell surface, whereas the control cells transfected with Neo vector alone did not show any reactivity to the anti hAPN MAb (data not shown). Control cells and the hAPN co-transfected cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E and the titer of released virus (Control-S and hAPN-S) or the total cell associated plus released virus (Control-T and hAPN-T) was determined at various times post-inoculation by plaque assay (Fig. 2\n). The data show that HCoV-229E entered, replicated, and infectious virus was efficiently released from mouse cells expressing hAPN protein (Fig. 2). The hAPN transgene construct/Neo co-transfected cells were also sorted for hAPN expression by FACS, and 88% were positive for cell surface expression post-sort (data not shown). Transfected cells sorted by hAPN expression were inoculated with a low MOI (0.001) and the supernatants were harvested over 72 h (Fig. 2, hAPN sorted, solid squares). These data show that HCoV-229E completed multiple rounds of replication in mouse cells that expressed hAPN. Cell lines were generated from the hAPN-positive population and analyzed for reactivity with a panel of anti-hAPN MAbs (WM15, WM47, MY7, DW1, Y2K, and BB1) that bind to multiple epitopes (Ashmun et al., 1995). MAb-DW1, -Y2K, and -BB1 are new anti-hAPN receptor MAbs and inhibit virus infection. FACS analysis of the hAPN-positive cell lines showed they reacted similarly with all six of the anti-hAPN MAbs, indicating proper surface conformation of hAPN on the mouse CMT93 cells (data not shown).",

Progeny mice from 8 founder animals were initially screened by a hAPN-specific RT-PCR assay designed to amplify only polyadenylated RNA from total RNA isolated from the small intestine. One of these lines expressed higher levels of hAPN mRNA and was used for subsequent studies (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from the kidney (K), small intestine (SI), lung (L), spleen (S), liver (Li), muscle (M), and heart (H) of non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice. The hAPN transcript was identified by a 712-bp amplicon visible by ethidium bromide staining in the kidney, small intestine, and liver of the transgenic mice and it was not amplified from the RNA of the non-transgenic animal tissues (Fig. 3\n, RT). The hAPN transcript amplicon was shown to be specific by Southern blot using a 32P labeled RNA probe complementary to the 3\u2032 terminus of hAPN and part of the SV40 3\u2032UTR that is specific to the transgene (data not shown). This assay demonstrated that the 712-bp amplicons visible by ethidium bromide staining and a band amplified from the lung RNA of the hAPN-transgenic mouse were specific to hAPN mRNA transcription (data not shown). The smaller amplicons observed in the lung, brain, and liver of both the non-transgenic and the hAPN-transgenic mice did not hybridize with the hAPN-specific probe and therefore were non-specific amplification products (data not shown). When the sensitivity of hAPN mRNA detection was increased using hemi-nested PCR that maintained the specificity for a polyadenylated hAPN transcript, a 439-bp amplicon was identified in every tissue tested in the transgenic mice (Fig. 3, HN). The data showed that hAPN mRNA was expressed at qualitatively higher levels in the kidney, small intestine, liver, and to a lesser extent in the lung, which was identified by Southern blot. This expression pattern corresponded to the tissue-specific expression pattern found in previous transcriptional analysis of the proximal hAPN promoter (Shapiro et al., 1991).",

These were detected by either streptavidin-HRP or a biotinylated rabbit anti-rat followed by streptavidin-HRP, respectively. The Vector Red substrate used stained regions bound by antibodies red and was also fluorescent. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The data showed the cell type distribution expected for mAPN in the epithelial cells of the brush border along the villi of the small intestine and by cells of the proximal convoluted tubule in the kidney (Fig. 4\n, anti-mAPN). Both the non-transgenic and the hAPN-transgenic mice showed similar mAPN protein distribution patterns, demonstrating that expression of the hAPN protein in the transgenic animals did not dramatically influence the level of mAPN expressed. Human APN protein was expressed in the small intestine and kidney of the transgenic mice in the same manner as mAPN (Fig. 4, anti-hAPN). The hAPN protein was expressed on the brush border membrane by epithelial cells on the intestinal villi and by cells in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney (Fig. 4, anti-hAPN). MAb-DW1 binding suggests that hAPN expressed in the mouse tissues was in the proper conformation for interaction with HCoV-229E.",

In addition, both mouse and human DCs are known to express APN (CD13) (Dong et al., 2000, Summers et al., 2001, Woodhead et al., 2000). To determine if dendritic cells of the hAPN-transgenic mice expressed hAPN protein and were susceptible to HCoV-229E, we derived DCs from the bone marrow (BM) of non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice. The BM\u2013DCs were prepared by isolating the BM from male littermates using magnetic separation to remove T cell, B cell, and macrophage precursors, and then culturing the remaining cells in medium containing IL4 and GMCSF for 5\u20137 days (Turner et al., 2004). Comparison of the fluorescence between BM\u2013DCs treated with no primary antibody (gray line) or a hamster MAb to an irrelevant antigen (dotted line) by FACS showed there was little non-specific reactivity (Fig. 7A, a and b). The BM\u2013DCs isolated from non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice reacted similarly with a hamster MAb against the DC marker CD11c (Fig. 7A, a and b, solid line with shaded area under the curve). Fig. 7A, panels c and d, shows that the BM\u2013DCs from non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice reacted similarly with rat anti-mAPN MAb-R3-242 (solid line shaded under the curve) when compared to cells treated with no primary antibody (gray line) or nonspecific control antibody (dotted line). MHC I (dashed line) and CEACAM1a (not shown) also showed very similar levels of expression in DCs derived from both the non-transgenic and transgenic littermates (Fig. 7A, e and f). Thus, the cells isolated and cultured from both hAPN-transgenic and non-transgenic mice showed consistent expression of multiple surface antigens. In contrast to the non-transgenic mice, substantial hAPN expression (solid line with shading under the curve) was observed on BM\u2013DCs isolated from the hAPN-transgenic mice, indicating that the DC-enriched population of cells expressed the hAPN protein from the transgene (Fig. 7A, e and f). FACS analysis using three different anti-hAPN MAbs (DW1, Y2K, and WM47) that bind to different regions of hAPN showed very similar reactivity with BM\u2013DCs from the hAPN-transgenic animals and very little reactivity with BM\u2013DCs from the non-transgenic mice (data not shown). This indicates that the hAPN on the DC surface was folded correctly and expressed several epitopes important in HCoV-229E receptor activity, as receptor binding MAb-DW1 and MAb-Y2K block HCoV-229E infection (data not shown).",

Analysis of the supernatant media collected from the BM\u2013DCs at 2 h and 20 h pi showed a two log10 increase in HCoV-229E titer from the transgenic mice (data not shown). Whereas, a decrease in virus titer was observed in the supernatant media of BM\u2013DC derived from the non-transgenic mice (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of proteins isolated from mock (M) or HCoV-229E inoculated (I) cells showed that BM\u2013DCs from hAPN-transgenic mice were susceptible to HCoV-229E as indicated by the doublet at \u223c45 kDa characteristic of viral nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig. 7B, arrow). No viral antigens were detected in BM\u2013DCs derived from the non-transgenic mice. IFA showed expression of hAPN protein (red) in most of the BM\u2013DCs and infection of some of the BM\u2013DCs (green) from the hAPN-transgenic mice (Fig. 7C). Thus, hAPN expression on the BM\u2013DCs of transgenic mice permitted infection by HCoV-229E and resulted in the replication and release of virus in vitro.",

APN has numerous biological activities, and many of these depend on its enzymatic activity and tissue localization. For example, APN plays important roles in digestion, cancer, angiogenesis, synaptic activity, and is responsible for cleaving peptides bound to MHC molecules of antigen presenting cells (Bhagwat et al., 2003, Ishii et al., 2001, Noren et al., 1997, Riemann et al., 1999).

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are extremely important antigen presenting cells that are critical to the initiation of both the adaptive and innate immune response of the host, and it is clear that their interactions with pathogens can have both positive and negative effects on pathogenesis (Liu, 2001, Mellman and Steinman, 2001). Coronaviruses gain entry into the host via respiratory or intestinal epithelium where there are numerous DCs. APN/CD13 is expressed by specific DC subsets and is important in maturation of DCs, extracellular degradation of antigens, and may be involved in T-cell activation (Amoscato et al., 1998, Liu, 2001, Summers et al., 2001, Woodhead et al., 2000). Consequently, we studied mAPN and hAPN expression on dendritic cells derived from the bone marrow (BM\u2013DCs) of non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice. Expressions of surface proteins including MHC I, CEACAM1a, mouse APN, and CD11c were very similar in both the non-transgenic and the hAPN-transgenic mice. In contrast, hAPN was only expressed by the DC-enriched population derived from the hAPN-transgenic mice. BM\u2013DCs isolated from the hAPN-transgenic mice were susceptible to HCoV-229E, whereas BM\u2013DCs derived from non-transgenic mice were not. Our data demonstrate that DCs from hAPN-transgenic mice are infected by HCoV-229E in a receptor-dependent fashion, and Thiel et al. have shown that HCoV-229E virus-like particles transduce human DCs (Thiel et al., 2003). Therefore, DCs in the human respiratory epithelium may play a role in the initiation of HCoV-229E infection and its dissemination to other tissues. Other group 1 coronaviruses that infect cats and pigs may also infect DCs via their cognate APN receptors (Delmas et al., 1992, Tresnan et al., 1996). Mouse DCs are also infected by mouse hepatitis virus-A59, a group 2 coronavirus, in a CEACAM1a receptor-dependent manner (Turner et al., 2004). DC\u2013coronavirus interaction may be a common evolutionary mechanism of entry, dissemination, immunomodulation, and pathogenesis observed in diverse coronaviruses, including feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and HCoV-229E (Ding et al., 2004, Holmes, 2001, Jeffers et al., 2004, Konikova et al., 1998, Thiel et al., 2003, Turner et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). In other viruses, such as LCMV and measles, infection of DCs leads to severe immunomodulation, impairment of antigen presentation, and cytokine expression (Borrow et al., 1995, Hahm et al., 2004, Naniche and Oldstone, 2000). The hAPN-transgenic mice developed in this study will provide an excellent reproducible source of hAPN-expressing mouse DCs to study the effect HCoV-229E infection has on DC function.",

There was no increase in virus titer in respiratory washes from hAPN-transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic controls. The RT-PCR/hemi-nested PCR procedure utilized to identify genomic RNA was more sensitive than plaque assay and could detect as little as 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 PFU in vitro. We consistently observed that the lung RNA from both non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice inoculated with HCoV-229E contained viral gRNA, most likely from the inoculum. When lung samples were tested for expression of sgRNAs that are produced during replication of HCoV-229E, all but one mouse were negative.

Many factors that can be eliminated or controlled in in vitro experiments cannot be controlled in vivo. These include adsorption time, temperature, concentration of virus at the cell surface, innate immune response, and presence of non-specific inhibitors such as mucins or pH. Some of these problems will be overcome by crossing these hAPN-transgenic mice with knockout mice (e.g., CD13, STAT1) or other mouse lines. Identification of new species-specific molecules that aid HCoV-229E binding or entry will aid in the development of a better transgenic mouse model. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and like APN it is a surface metalloprotease that is expressed in the respiratory tract, small intestine, spleen, brain, liver, and kidney (Hamming et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2004). DC-SIGN binds SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (Marzi et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004) and we have shown that CD209L can act as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV (Jeffers et al., 2004). CD209L, DC-SIGN, or other species-specific receptors may also facilitate entry of HCoV-229E and their identification will provide new tools to improve hAPN-transgenic mice as a small animal model.",

Serial passage may have resulted in the accumulation of mutations that are advantageous in vitro, but these mutations could have adverse affects in vivo. New genomic sequence information from HCoV-229E-related viruses that are currently circulating may identify differences between natural isolates and the laboratory adapted HCoV-229E strain.

Our results show the value of the present hAPN-transgenic line as a source of different primary cell types for the elucidation of factors critical to virus entry and the host response to HCoV-229E. For example, hAPN-transgenic mouse BM\u2013DCs can be used to gain a better understanding of DC\u2013coronavirus interactions. A similar approach has proven very helpful for study of the interaction of wild-type measles virus with DCs isolated from CD150-transgenic mice (Hahm et al., 2004). These hAPN-transgenic mice may also be useful as models for new coronaviruses or other human pathogens that may interact with hAPN (Gredmark et al., 2004, Larsson et al., 1998, Moller et al., 1999, van der Hoek et al., 2004).

To test the mixed population for receptor activity, HCoV-229E was inoculated onto replicate wells of the control cells or the hAPN transgene-transfected cells at an MOI of 0.6 in 0.3 ml for 1 h at 34 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. The inoculum was removed and the cells were washed 2 times with 2 ml of medium, and 3 ml of medium was added. The cells were incubated at 34 \u00b0C and 5% CO2, at 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-inoculation, the supernatants were collected, or the cells in duplicate plates were scraped and pooled with the supernatants for virus titration. The pooled cells and supernatants were frozen and thawed 3 times, and cell debris removed by centrifugation. Virus titration was determined by plaque assay in MRC5 cells.",

DNA isolated from 8 founder lines of mice was analyzed by PCR using intron-spanning primers (DT-21 and DT-22) specific for hAPN cDNA. APN has many biological functions and is involved in a variety of cancers; however, we did not observe any consistent abnormalities such as tumors, developmental problems, or other obvious disease due to the expression of hAPN in transgenic mice. Mice were humanely euthanized consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association. All work on mice was done under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded to produce the MAbs. MAb-Y2K blocked virus infection, but had no effect on the enzymatic activity of hAPN. MAb-DW1 and MAb-BB1 also blocked virus infection, but decreased enzymatic activity by approximately 55% (data not shown). MAb DW1 was purified, biotinylated, and used to stain the transgenic mouse tissues. Other anti-hAPN MAbs, WM47 (DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA), MY7 (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA), and WM15 (Biodesign, Kennebunk, ME) were purchased. Control MAb against cholera toxin was kindly provided by Dr. Randall Holmes (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO).

Temperature cycling parameters were 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 57 \u00b0C for 45 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. This yielded a 712-base pair (bp) product from RNA produced by the transgene construct and a 614-bp from RNA of the natural human transcript expressed in MRC5 cells. To control for RNA integrity and cDNA production, mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also amplified from 2 \u03bcl of the same cDNA using a GAPDH-specific forward primer (G3P-279) and the oligo-dT/Xho1 reverse primer. An aliquot (2 \u03bcl) from the hAPN RT-PCR reaction was used as template in another PCR reaction with a hemi-nested set of primers that amplify a 439-bp fragment.
