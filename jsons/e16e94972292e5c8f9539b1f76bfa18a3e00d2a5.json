Improvements in DNA delivery over prior needle and syringe approaches include jet delivery, gene gun delivery, among others. Among the most effective of these new delivery methods, advanced electroporation (EP), combined with other advances, induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in both preventative as well as therapeutic studies. Advancements in the design of the DNA inserts include leader sequence changes, RNA and codon optimizations, improved insert designs, increased concentrations of DNA, and skin delivery, appear to complement newer delivery strategies. These advances also provide a framework for the in vivo production of synthetic DNA biologics. In this review, we focus on recent studies of synthetic DNA vaccines in the clinic for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases with a focus on adaptive electroporation for delivery, and briefly summarize novel preclinical data advancing the in vivo delivery of DNAencoded antibody-like biologics.",

However, the development of new vaccines faces challenges. This is due to multiple factors including the high cost of their development which drives a focus on larger markets, slower than optimal time lines for vaccine advancement to clinical testing, among other complexities. One example is the increased occurrence of emerging and reemerging infections which appear sporadically and could benefit greatly from rapid vaccine interventions. Examples include Lassa, Powasan virus, ZIKA virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and the coronaviruses-Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2)-among many others. An ideal vaccine platform should be simple to deploy, rapid to develop, reproducible, temperature stable, and consistently manufacturable-thus lowering costs and development risks while providing an important new tool. The synthetic DNA (SynDNA) platform addresses many of these important goals.",

Following local injection by needle and syringe plasmid DNA is taken up by a limited number of cells at the site of injection, where the DNA is transcribed into mRNA and translated into antigen intracellularly. Adaptive EP increases the initial uptake of plasmid by local cells approximately 500x [3] . This creates a large antigen bolus to drive a more potent immune response. With adaptive EP most cells in the local field can be transfected [4 ] . Locally transfected antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can directly traffic to the regional lymph node (LN) which is critical to initiating the immune response [5, 6] . Translated antigen can be shed exogenously and picked up by APCs for cross presentation. Shed exogenous soluble antigen can drain locally to the regional LN and extracellular spaces in the local environment allowing for engagement of B cell immunity. Local tissue becomes a protein factory for presentation of antigen on major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC I) or MHC II molecules for re-expansion of LN primed CD8 + T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs) and CD4 + T cells, respectively ( Figure 1a ). For comprehensive review, see Ref. [4 ] . Since the 90 0 s DNA plasmids have been delivered to tens of thousands of patients by multiple routes, in trials studying numerous vaccine antigen targets with a highly consistent safety record supporting its further clinical development [7] .",

Despite the relatively mild clinical illness, ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with severe congenital birth defects such as microcephaly. The first Zika vaccine advanced to the clinic was a synDNA vaccine delivered by adaptive EP [10] [11] [12] . Tebas et al. evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a synthetic DNA vaccine targeting Zika prME, [12 ] . In this Phase 1 dose-ranging study participants received either 1 or 2 mg of ZIKV DNA immunogens delivered by the ID route and CELLEC-TRA-EP at 0, 4, and 12 weeks. After the third immunization Zika-specific binding antibodies were detected in all participants at average titers of 1/2000 for the 1 mg dose group or 1/3000 for the higher dose group) 96% of participants developed Zika-neutralizing antibodies detected via U87 neuronal cell assay. Importantly, passive transfer studies where patient serum was given to interferon knockout mice (which are susceptible to ZIKV infection) showed that sera from vaccinated subjects protected mice from lethal pathogenic ZIKV challenge [12 ] . ZIKV-specific T cells were induced in most subjects. This ZIKV DNA vaccine was moved from research program initiation to the clinic in just 6.5 months highlighting the efficiency and speed with which a synthetic DNA platform can be brought to bear against an emerging or re-emerging pathogen. The Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the national institutes of health reported the results of two ZIKV DNA vaccine trials (VRC 319 and VRC320) evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of DNA plasmids encoding the PrM and E proteins of a ZIKV-Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) chimera delivered at 4 mg doses either 2x or 3x (VRC 319) or native leader like ZIKV (VRC320) vaccines vaccinated with 4 mg doses immunized three times at different intervals. In VRC 319 GMT average per group was and for VRC 320 GMT ranged from . The vaccines induced neutralizing titers using a reporter assay and showed T cell mediated cytokine release [13] and the authors suggest that the VRC320 vaccine group developed more consistent seroconversion, neutralization, and T cell immunity over the JEV chimeric Zika vaccine.",

SynEBOV-GP DNA immunization also resulted in 100% protection of macaques from lethal EBOV challenge [14] . Importantly in these studies determined that a dose-sparing 2-injection regimen delivered via the recently characterized intradermal-EP (CELLECTRA-EP) [15] route was 100% protective against lethal challenge. These responses were persistent up to one year after immunization with robust recall responses observed at this time point [14] . These promising results supported a first in-human (FIH) clinical trial. Two EBOV-GP candidates, INO-4201 encoding a SynconEBOV-GP antigen representative of outbreak strains from 1976 to 2008, and INO 4202 encoding Zaire Makona EBOV-GP from a 2014 outbreak, were evaluated alone, together, and in combination with DNA-encoded human interleukin-12 (IL-12) delivered by either the IM or ID routes using Cellectra EP. Both delivery routes induced potent anti-Ebola cellular and humoral immunity. However, the ID delivery route was dose sparing and promoted more rapid seroconversion (100% seroreactivity) after 2 immunizations. The simplicity, consistency, and tolerability of the ID format appears to exhibit important advantages for vaccine development against emerging and re-emerging pathogens [16 ] , and could have a supportive role for the current VSV-ZEBOV vaccine.",

However, persons already infected with remain at high risk for a collection of HPV diseases, including cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, anal cancer, vaginal cancer, and others HPV-associated cancers. The first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial was advanced to test the hypothesis that a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding HPV immunogens for modified nuclear oncogenes E6 and E7 from HPV types 16 and 18 (two high risk genotypes) would induce CTLs that might impact HPV-induced cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). An initial immunogenicity study [23] reported that the vaccine was highly immunogenic, driving antibodies and CTLs in almost all vaccinated subjects. A follow-up Phase IIb efficacy trail was subsequently reported [24 ] . The study showed potent induction of immunity including CD8 T cells that migrated to the diseased cervical tissue. Overall 49.5% of women in this study regressed their disease, while 40.2% regressed and cleared their cervical infection. This is the first therapeutic vaccine to show clinical efficacy against grade 2 and 3 CIN [24 ] . Additional study of this approach for CIN is in progress. This report is also the first treatment efficacy data generated for a DNA approach against a human disease.",

These data demonstrate that MEDI0457 can induce clear and durable HPV16/18 antigen-specific peripheral and tumor-infiltrating immune responses that may further benefit patients in the context of check point inhibitor (CPI) therapy to improve therapeutic outcomes. Interestingly, this group reported a second complete responder in the context of CPI combination therapy. Additional study of this approach is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04001413).

Similarly, other immune disorders and cancers may be treated with monoclonal antibodies targeting cancer-specific antigens or immunosuppressive molecules present on immune cells such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). Indeed anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 immunotherapy have had success in the clinic and become standard of care cancer treatment approaches [27] . Recent reports have described use of the SynDNAencoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) therapy to deliver anti-PD-1 [28 ] and anti-CTLA-4 [29 ] immunotherapy in vivo. Bi-specific antibodies which engage cancer targets and cytotoxic T lymphocytes leading to T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells, are growing in clinical importance. The first FDA approved bispecific is Blincyto (Blinatumomab), which targets CD19 on B cells for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bispecfic drugs are complex to produce, can have short half-lives and as such, can be associated with high costs per treatment limiting their development and patient access. Taking into account its high local production in tissues, new SynDNA Ig production approach offer an alternative production pipeline for biologics. As an extension of this approach Perales-Puchalt reported on in vivo delivery with several months expression of a DNA encoded bispecific antibody delivered directly in vivo which demonstrated potent tumor control in a mouse model [30 ] supporting the delivery of nonnative Ig forms.",
