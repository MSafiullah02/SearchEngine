Incubation of LDV with normal mouse plasma or nonneutralizing mAbs to LDV VP-3 had no effect on its sedimentation rate. Similarly, incubation of a neutralization escape variant of LDV with the mAb used in its selection had no effect on its sedimentation rate, whereas neutralization of this variant by polyclonal mouse or rabbit anti-VP 3 antibodies increased the sedimentation rate. Neutralization of LDV infectivity was only observed at high anfibody/virion ratios and often was followed by loss of the viral RNA. The results suggest that neutralization of LDV infectivity results from binding of multiple antibody molecules that recognize specific epitopes on the viral envelope glycoprotein and ultimately leads to disintegration of the virions.",

            "text": "The infection of animal cells by a virus is generally mediated by specific surface protein(s) of the virus and interaction of antibodies with certain antigenic sites on this protein may lead to abolishment or neutralization of viral infectivity. However, the mechanism of neutralization of viral infectivity is still poorly understood at the molecular level and may differ for different viruses and different antibodies [7, 17, 20-22, 27, 39] . In the case of non-enveloped viruses, the general concept has been that binding of one or a few antibody molecules causes a conformational change in the capsid or cross-linking of the capsomers that renders the virus non-infectious, but recent work suggests that in many cases virus aggregation may also play an important role in neutralization [-5, 90 P.G.W. Plagemann et al. 17, 23, 35, 39] . Less clear is the mechanism of antibody neutralization of enveloped viruses. Neutralizing antibody binding to virions may prevent interaction with host cell receptors, but more often aborts infection at the level of penetration-uncoating of the virions [7, 8, 10, 27] . In the case of influenza virus, neutralizing antibodies bind to epitopes adjacent to the receptor binding (virus attachment) site and the mode of in vitro neutralization depends on the antibody/virion ratio [27] . At low anfibody/virion ratios neutralization of infectivity is associated with virion aggregation and inhibition ofvirion attachment to cell receptors, whereas at high antibody/virion ratios neutralized virions remain monodisperse and infection is blocked at a step following internalization by the cells [27] . Furthermore, in some instances neutralization of enveloped viruses may be due to antibody-dependent complement lysis [7, 20, 21] .",

LDV has been tentatively classified as a togavirus [38] , but recent studies suggest that it has a gene organization similar to that of equine arteritis virus and thus of coronaviruses [9, 19, 29] . It establishes an asymptomatic infection in mice that invariably lasts for the life of the animal [6, 29, 31, 32] . LDV replication in vitro and most likely also in vivo is restricted to a subpopulation of tissue macrophages [29, 33, 34, 36] possessing a surface protein that acts as LDV receptor [2, 16, 18, 26, 29] . Though LDV replication in macrophages is rapidly cytocidal, a persistent infection in mice can be maintained by the generation of new permissive macrophages throughout the animal's life [25, 29, 33, 34] .",

            "text": "How LDV escapes host immune responses is still unclear. Mice generate a rapid and strong antibody response to several epitopes on VP-3, but antibodies that neutralize LDV in vitro appear in the circulation of mice only 1-2 months postinfection (p.i.)and seem relatively inefficient in LDV neutralization [3, 25, 29, 32] . VP-3 varies in size from 25-40kDa, probably because of different degrees of glycosylation [3, 11, 12, 29] . It is quite small compared to the envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, which may play a role in the mechanism by which LDV escapes host immune functions. In attemps to elucidate these mechanisms we have generated batteries of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to LDV VP-3 [11, 12] . Five mAbs generated to formalin-inactivated LDV have been found to interact with a single antigenic site on VP-3 of intact virions and to neutralize their infectivity, but the epitope recognized by the neutralizing mAbs is non-immunogenic during a natural infection [12] . Two additional epitopes on VP-3 are recognized by non-neutralizing mAbs to formalin-inac-tivated LDV. Neither polyclonal nor monoclonal neutralizing anti-LDV antibodies protect mice from LDV infection when passively transferred by any route, even at very high concentrations I-3, 12, 29] . The present study shows that the in vitro neutralization of LDV infectivity for mice correlates with a marked increase in the sedimentation rate of the virions, rather than the formation of large aggregates. It seems to involve the binding of multiple antibody molecules per virion and most likely cross-linking of viral proteins and structural alterations that ultimately lead to the disintegration of the virions.",

If not indicated otherwise, the mixtures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h and at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then a 10 gl sample was removed from each mixture for titration of residual LDV infectivity by mouse inoculation [3] to assess the degree of virion neutralization. The remainder of each mixture was layered onto a 0.15-0.9 M gradient of sucrose in TNE (100mM NaC1, 10raM Tris-HC1, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) over 0.5 ml of a 2 M sucrose cushion. The gradients were centrifuged in a SW41 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge at 36,000rpm for 1.5 or 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Fractions of 0.35 ml were collected from the gradients and analyzed for radioactivity in acid-insoluble material [36] . 1) . A similar incubation of 3H-labeled L D V with normal mouse plasma (NMP) or the nonneutralizing m A b 159-3 had no effect on the sedimentation of L D V ( Fig. 1 A) , even though the latter also binds to VP-3 and the F A staining titer of the 159-3 m A b ascites fluid was as high as that of the ascites fluid containing the neutralizing m A b s (~> 15,000). Neutralizing mAbs 159-7 and 159-18 react with the same antigenic site on L D V VP-3 and are of IgG 2a isotype [12] . However, neutralization of L D V by incubation with two other m A b s directed to this site but of isotype I g G 2 b (159-12) or IgG 1 (159-19) was also associated with an increase in virion sedimentation rate, whereas incubation with additional nonneutralizing m A b s to VP-3 failed to elicit this effect (data not shown). As pointed out already, the I M P and I R P do not contain significant levels of antibodies to the antigenic site recognized by the nemralizing mAbs [12] ; thus neutralization of L D V by antibodies to at least two epitopes on VP-3 correlated with an increased sedimentation rate. F r o m the sedimentation profiles in Fig. 1 A, we estimated that neutralization was associated with an increase in sedimentation coefficient of L D V from about 230 S to 270-280 S. The sedimentation coefficient of 230 S for L D V was estimated from a comparison of its sedimentation rate to that of SFV (264 S; reported in [14, 15] ; see Fig. 1 ",

In some sedimentation analyses we observed the formation of an additional even more rapidly sedimenting fraction in neutralized LDV preparations (Fig. 2 A) (Fig. 2 A) . The loss of radioactivity seems to reflect a modification in virion structure that renders the viral RNA susceptible to nuclease degradation, since the radioactivity lost from virions was not recovered in other fractions of the sucrose density gradient (Fig. 2 A, and data not shown) . Complement probably did not play a role in the degradation of neutralized virions since the loss of radioactivity during incubation with IMP was observed whether or not the IMP had been preheated (56 \u00b0C, 30 min) and since addition of rabbit complement to the LDVneutralizing antibody incubation mixture had no significant effect on the change Previously it has been demonstrated that LDV-antibody complexes fix complement only poorly [24] and that complement has no significant effect on the neutralization of LDV by anti-LDV polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies [3, 12] . The presence of 2.5 mg RNAse A/ml in the incubation mixture had no effect on the sedimentation properties or infectivity of LDV and also did not affect the neutralization of LDV by anti-LDV monoclonal (159-12) or polyclonaI (IMP) antibodies (data not shown). The results indicate that the more rapidly sedimenting particles in neutralized LDV preparations contain virions in which the viral R N A is still protected from RNAse attack. Thus they cannot represent aggregated nucleocapsids since the viral R N A in the latter is sensitive to nuclease degradation [1] .",

            "text": "Our data demonstrate a strong correlation between LDV neutralization by anti-LDV polyclonai and monoclonal antibodies to at least two epitopes of the envelope glycoprotein VP-3 and increased sedimentation rate of the virus. The results suggest that LDV neutralization is not a result of virion aggregation, but instead results from a binding of multiple antibodies to each virion. On the basis of the S value of the neutralized virions, we estimate that at least ten Neutralization of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus 97 antibodies are bound per neutralized virion. Furthermore, to achieve neutralization the virions must be incubated with high concentrations of neutralizing antibodies. For an about 90% neutralization, 108 IDs0 of LDV must be incubated at 37 \u00b0C with at least 1014 neutralizing anti-LDV mAb molecules (0.02 ml of ascites fluid containing 2 mg anti-LDV mAb/ml). Thus, antibody binding that results in neutralization of LDV is rather inefficient. This is also indicated by the finding that neutralization by anti-LDV antibodies occurs at 37 \u00b0C but not at 4 \u00b0C [4] . Long-term incubation of LDV with neutralizing antibodies seems to lead to degradation of viral RNA, presumably as a consequence of antibody-induced alterations in virion structure and nuclease attack. Most likely it involves the sloughing off of the viral envelope, thus exposing the nucleocapsid in which the viral RNA is not protected from nuclease attack [1] . The envelope of LDV is unusually fragile; it is readily removed by treatment of LDV with non-ionic detergents at concentrations as low as 0.01% and by exposure of LDV to hypotonic solutions [1] . Degradation of viral RNA, however, is probably a secondary effect, since it seems to occur less rapidly than neutralization of infectivity and the rapidly sedimenting fractions contain intact virions in which the viral RNA is still protected from RNAse degradation. The nature of the structural alterations induced by the binding of neutralizing anti-LDV antibodies is unclear and it is not known whether the change is triggered by the binding of the antibodies per se or requires additional interactions. The nonneutralizing anti-LDV mAbs are also specific for the envelope glycoprotein VP-3, but they may not bind to intact virions because of an inaccessibility of the epitopes they recognize or their binding fails to induce structural alterations or cross-linking of VP-3 that may be required for neutralization. Whether crosslinking of VP-3 by antibodies plays a role in neutralization could not be investigated, because protein G purification of the neutralizing mAbs caused a loss of neutralizing activity. Since protein G-purified mAbs exhibit undiminished interaction with LDV in an ELISA and with LDV-infected macrophages in the FA staining the loss in neutralizing activity could indicate that an additional component(s) present in anti-LDV preparations may play a role in neutralization of LDV infectivity in vitro, which is removed during protein G purification. However, ascites fluid from unrelated hybridomas, normal mouse serum or complement failed to restore the neutralizing activity of these antibodies.",
