            "text": "\nCryptosporidium and Giardia are ubiquitous parasites that infect human and domesticated animals, in addition to many other mammalian, avian and reptilian wildlife species. Often, wildlife diseases are considered important only if human health or agricultural interests are affected directly. Recent epizootic infections of diseases such as West Nile virus, avian influenza, chronic wasting disease, Nipah virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have highlighted the importance of understanding the interrelationship among human, domestic-animal and wildlife disease. Environmental pollution with human and domestic-animal fecal material is recognized as a potential pathogen pathway for wildlife infections with zooanthropomorphic parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium; such infections can put wildlife populations at risk. Several wildlife species are parasitized by Giardia and Cryptosporidium, and have frequently been considered reservoirs of zoonotic disease. The increased application of genotyping at the molecular level has revealed that free-living and captive wildlife can harbor both host-adapted and zoonotic strains of Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Studies of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in wildlife continue to provide important insights into the taxonomy, host range and zoonotic potential of these protozoan parasites. Although this article is limited to Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections in mammalian wildlife, many of the issues considered are directly applicable to reptile and avian wildlife species.",

Much of the research on Cryptosporidium and Giardia in wildlife has focused on cataloging species that are naturally susceptible to these parasites. The lack of morphological differences between genetic variants of Giardia and Cryptosporidium found in mammals resulted in an inaccurate picture of which wildlife species were potential zoonotic reservoirs. Genotyping of samples using molecular analysis at informative loci is necessary to distinguish the species and genotypes that are involved and their zoonotic potential.",

Of the 14 accepted species of Cryptosporidium, Cryptosporidium parvum seems to be the most widely distributed, have the broadest host range and be most commonly associated with human and livestock infections [3]. Previously, it was assumed that the majority of Cryptosporidium infections in wild mammals, with oocysts morphometrically identical to C. parvum, was due to C. parvum and that these mammals represented an important zoonotic reservoir for human cryptosporidiosis. Similar-sized oocysts recovered from water supplies were also assumed to be infectious to humans (either C. parvum or Cryptosporidium hominis). The application of modern molecular techniques, however, has revealed that wild mammals harbor host-adapted genotypes that are not considered to be a major public health risk because they have not yet been identified in human infections [3]. The role that wildlife and farmed animals have had in zoonotic transmission to humans might, therefore, have been overestimated.",

As with Cryptosporidium, the recent application of molecular techniques to G. duodenalis isolates has revealed a genetic diversity within this species (for review, see Ref. [4]). Currently, there are six recognized variants or assemblages of G. duodenalis, each having a varying degree of host specificity (Table 2\n).

The species that is implicated most often in waterborne contamination is the beaver, to the extent that giardiasis in North America is commonly referred to as \u2018beaver fever\u2019. The presence of Giardia cysts or Cryptosporidium oocysts in the stools or intestinal scrapings of animals that were found within the confines of watercourses used for human consumption was enough to implicate these animals as a source of contamination 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. In most instances, identification was based solely on morphometric comparison with reference laboratory strains of G. duodenalis or C. parvum. The more recent application of molecular techniques to the characterization of isolates from beavers and other wild mammals provides clearer evidence for proper assessment of the health risk that wildlife poses in specific areas.",

Novel Giardia genotypes, however, are still being discovered in wildlife, particularly in marsupials; the recent discovery of two novel and genetically distinct Giardia genotypes, isolated from a bandicoot in Southwestern Australia and from a Tasmanian devil, serve as recent examples [12] (R.C.A. Thompson, unpublished). It is often possible to detect a newly characterized genotype in other species; the bandicoot Giardia genotype was subsequently detected in sheep housed at a university farm in Western Australia and in house mice sampled from a sub-Antarctic island off the southern coast of Australia [13] (R.C.A.

Zoos, conservation parks and wildlife-rehabilitation centers provide an ideal arena in which to study these parasites because a variety of mammalian species can be studied over an extended period. The number and diversity of species in a captive setting enable the study of animals from widely different geographic locations without the cost and logistical problems that preclude this type of long-term research in the wild. In these simulated environments, however, the captive mammals are in unusually close contact with humans and other animal species that they would not normally encounter in the wild. This high density of animals and the high-stress environment often associated with captivity might result in an increased susceptibility to disease and the exposure of the captive mammals to species of parasite that they would not usually encounter in the wild. Although studies of captive mammals might not mirror the situation in free-living mammals directly, this research is important to aid zoological-management strategies and to give insight into host\u2013parasite interactions in mammalian wildlife species that would otherwise be inaccessible to study.",

The enclosure with the highest prevalence was an artificial reproduction of a tropical sylvan; it was fully enclosed and, therefore, was not open to the natural elements. The artificially high humidity and moderate temperatures might have contributed to the protection and sustained viability of the oocysts. Larger enclosures that were more exposed to the elements showed a decreased prevalence of Cryptosporidium. Although housing was one of the contributing factors to variation in prevalence, differences in animal density, species, age and oocyst-shedding intensity, and varying cleaning regimes among the three enclosures could also have contributed to the observed differences. Although this study had a small sample size and, ideally, should be repeated with a larger number of animals, it highlights the importance of housing as a possible risk factor for captive wildlife.

Without genetic characterization, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions from these studies about transmission. The animals could have been harboring their own host-adapted Cryptosporidium genotype that would make the issue of transmission from animal to animal both within and among enclosures less of a threat.

            "text": "\nGiardia and Cryptosporidium have been isolated from many species of captive and free-living wildlife, representing most mammalian orders. Wildlife, therefore, is an important contributor \u2013 together with humans, domestic animals and livestock \u2013 to the pool of parasites within the environment. However, compared with the abundance of surveys that have identified the occurrence of Giardia and/or Cryptosporidium in wildlife species, very few studies have characterized the parasites found. The molecular tools are now available with which isolates of Giardia and Cryptosporidium can be characterized directly from feces. Consequently, it will be possible to determine whether the isolates are novel species or whether wildlife is functioning as a reservoir for species that infect humans or domestic animals. Thus, future studies of wildlife isolates at the molecular level are paramount for refining the host range, transmission dynamics and zoonotic potential of known and novel Giardia and Cryptosporidium species and genotypes. Future studies must be undertaken in defined locations in which host assemblages and their interactions are well understood so that the results of genotyping studies can be put into an ecological context. The isolation from wildlife of strains of Giardia and Cryptosporidium that are normally associated with humans and livestock will also provide important insights into the effect that anthropogenic activities such as sewage disposal and farming have on the overall health of the environment.",

Of the 68 studies represented, only ten of the Giardia studies and 18 of the Cryptosporidium surveys were undertaken at the molecular level. Future studies of wildlife that incorporate molecular analysis are paramount for refining the host range, transmission dynamics and zoonotic potential of known and novel Giardia and Cryptosporidium species and genotypes. Therefore, future studies must be undertaken in defined locations in which host assemblages and their interactions are well understood so that the results of genotyping studies can be put into an ecological context.
