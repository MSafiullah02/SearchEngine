On 7 January, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause, and on 11 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally called the disease caused by this virus COVID-19 (Disease induced by SARS-CoV-2). A few days earlier, on 30 January 2020, the WHO announced that the coronavirus epidemic was a public health emergency of international concern , and on 11 March, the outbreak was declared a global pandemic. By the end of March 2020, 693,224 positive cases and 33,106 deaths had been detected worldwide, of which 392,757 and 23,962, respectively, occurred in the European region. Italy and Spain are at the top of the list, and France and the United Kingdom are beginning to rapidly increase reported cases (WHO, 2020b) . In the United States, detected cases are already of concern (WHO, 2020b).",

Some patients develop a severe set of symptoms and progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, having to be admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), with the need to be assisted with mechanical ventilation . As it has a high pandemic potential, the virus has the capacity to be rapidly transmitted between humans, and within Europe in countries such as Spain and Italy, a large number of health professionals have been infected. To avoid this, it is recommended that professionals use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) according to the level of risk of the task to be performed with these patients (Jiang, Broome, and Ning, 2020) . However, as this is a global problem, governments are having serious problems in acquiring this equipment in the market and providing these materials to healthcare professionals. This situation has been a real problem, because it contributes to the collapse of the health system by having a large number of professionals on sick leave, in addition to limited available space and beds within the ICUs (del Rio and Malani, 2020; Saglietto, D'Ascenzo, Zoccai, and De Ferrari, 2020) .",

In a social context where it could be debated whether it is a priority at this time to attend to the psychosocial aspects of these professionals in their workplaces , the fact is that these workers are exposed to the virus on a daily basis and are afraid of infecting themselves and/or their families or patients; face long working hours, high mental workload, stress and emotional fatigue; are exposed to high doses of pain and emotional suffering; and are even exposed to the stigma and physical and psychological violence of a society that is also afraid (Duan and Zhu, 2020; Huang, Xu, and Liu, 2020; WHO, 2020a) . But these are not the only elements of risk present. In this article, we examine the occupational psychosocial risk factors that have emerged or have been accentuated during the COVID-19 crisis for the health professional; the psychosocial risks to which he or she is exposed, with particular attention to various forms of stress that may be developing at this time and their consequences; as well as the urgent protective measures that should be taken in psychosocial protection. We will end with some considerations to be taken into account by the health authorities and agencies in order to ensure a future in which we have health professionals recovered from this crisis, resilient and with optimal levels of work engagement to face the new challenges that the future holds for us as a society.",

In addition to physical stress, the health professional is currently facing an enormous mental burden (Huang et al., 2020) , as has already happened in other epidemics such as SARS or the Ebola crisis (Lehmann et al., 2015; Marjanovic, Greenglass, and Coffey, 2007) . Professionals do not have all the human and technological resources desirable for safe patient care del Rio and Malani, 2020; . In many places in Spain, improvised spaces are being organized to care for patients, without sufficient coordination, specialization, and health organization (State Confederation of Medical Unions, 2020). Professionals also have to attend to the psychological needs of patients and their isolated relatives, since the entry of other specialized mental health personnel is limited by the period of quarantine (Duan and Zhu, 2020) . They are seeing patients die without the presence of their families because of the conditions of isolation, and these professionals are the only ones who can humanize and dignify this farewell. Therefore, they are exposed abruptly and in large doses to death, human suffering and loneliness. They are afraid of becoming infected and of infecting patients and their loved ones (Huang et al., 2020) . Ultimately, they are also afraid of their own death and that of their relatives . Their levels of work overload and emotional demand are very high . Conflict and role ambiguity can also arise, especially among professionals who are being called upon to act in the field with less experience and without the proper expertise. Many are also isolated and not being able to be in touch with the families. Time pressure and rapid decision-making are multiplying, sometimes in the face of ethical dilemmas that would require complex solutions, increasing the pressure for civil and criminal liability for irreversible acts and mistakes that may be committed (Greenberg, Docherty, Gnanapragasam, and Wessely, 2020) .",

In this sense, these professionals will be exposed to what is known as secondary traumatic stress, a set of psychological symptoms that a professional acquires due to exposure to people who have experienced a trauma (Figley, 2002; Kelly, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . In other words, these are reactions derived from the performance of a traumatic work task that can be enhanced when mixed with high degrees of empathy. The symptoms suffered by the professional may be the same as those of the victims of the trauma, and include intrusive thoughts, traumatic memories, nightmares, insomnia, irritability, emotional lability, fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, avoidance of people and places, hypervigilance and sadness.",

The incorporation of psychologists specializing in crises and emergencies not only reduces the emotional demands that patients and families place on already overburdened health professionals, but also allows the psychological needs of the staff to be met Duan and Zhu, 2020) . Debriefing and emotional ventilation can be an interesting resource at this time to implement in the unit, with the aim of expressing in a controlled way the emotions and stories experienced. The support of colleagues and supervisors is fundamental, and the approaches to collective coping are extremely interesting (Rodr\u00edguez, Kozusznik, Peir\u00f3, and Tordera, 2019) . Organizational and leadership support is also critical to support these actions (Brooks et al., 2020; Unadkat and Farquhar, 2020; WHO, 2020a) . Providing health professionals with the necessary technical resources and support will increase their levels of self-efficacy and personal control (which is much needed in these circumstances), and may reduce their stress levels as a result . For example, it can be very useful for the professional to receive sufficient preparation about how to deal with the ethical dilemmas that will be presented (Greenberg et al., 2020) . This will also help professionals to be able to control and manage their own stress response, with the help of techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, maintaining basic nutritional and physical activity guidelines, controlling negative thoughts and rumination and allowing them to be connected to their loved ones through social networks. The practitioner should be encouraged to develop active coping with stress and the situation Huang et al., 2020) . Likewise, promoting personal resources of resilience (hardiness, optimism and emotional competence) is useful to foster psychological health and well-being of professionals, as well as more resilient organizations (Garrosa, Moreno-Jim\u00e9nez, Rodr\u00edguez-Mu\u00f1oz, Rodr\u00edguez-Carvajal, 2011) .",

Without a doubt, going out to applaud motivates professionals, but the authorities and health institutions will have to take a step forward and carry out structural measures that will result in real change in the working conditions of these professionals. Several recognised experts in occupational health are already warning that if we do not make these changes, the number of professionals who are burned, and who leave the profession will increase (Eurofound, 2019; Maslach, 2017) . They are exposed to risks on a daily basis, often out of their own moral duty. Our society must respond to them in the same way, and this time we cannot fail them. ",
