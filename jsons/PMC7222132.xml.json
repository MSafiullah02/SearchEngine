Some of these interventions which initially focused on the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome now appear to be substantially applicable to all mechanically ventilated patients [6, 13]. Previous observational data [14\u201316] have shown that short-term mortality of mechanically ventilated patients has decreased over time. Nevertheless, several aspects in the management of critically ill patients have been shown to differ across intensive care units (ICUs) and countries, leading to considerable clinical variability [17].",

Some variations may be explained by the characteristics of individual patients or by differences in the ability of doctors who rely too much on subjective judgement. However, unwarranted clinical variability may exist, defined as variations in patient outcomes that cannot be explained by the patient\u2019s underlying illness or patient care based on evidence-based medicine [18]. The existence of unwarranted variability may have a negative impact on quality of care and clinical outcomes [19]. Geographical variability in outcome has been reported in several conditions such as ischemic heart disease [20, 21], cancer [22\u201324], and cardiac arrest [25]. However, the geographical or inter-country variability in mortality in critically ill patients has been little evaluated.",

The first step was to estimate the crude temporal trends of mortality over the four periods by creating a logistic regression model with study year, coded as a dummy variable, as the only independent variable, and 28-day mortality as the dependent variable. To adjust this estimate, we then fitted a multilevel (patients and countries) logistic regression model accounting for baseline demographic variables (age, sex, SAPS II, and reason for initiation of mechanical ventilation); variables related to the evolution of patients over the course of mechanical ventilation [development of organ failure (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and hematologic) defined as a SOFA score higher than two points]; complications during the course of mechanical ventilation, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia; variables related to the ventilatory setting [use of NPPV, a lung-protective strategy (arbitrarily defined as tidal volume below 6 ml/kg actual body weight or tidal volume below 8 ml/kg actual body weight plus plateau or peak inspiratory pressure less than 30 cmH2O)]; and variables related to ventilator management (use of sedation, neuromuscular blocking, and performance of tracheotomy). The random part of the model included two effects and their possible correlation: a random effect in the intercept modeling heterogeneity of mortality among countries in the first study, and a random effect in the slope modeling heterogeneity of changes in mortality over time among countries. The model was estimated by maximum likelihood using the adaptive Gaussian quadrature approximation (with seven quadrature points) [28]. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess the goodness of fit and to compare alternative models. The measure of fixed effects was the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Second, to estimate the random variability of outcomes between countries, we calculated the median odds ratio (MOR) defined as the median value of the odds ratio between the country at highest risk of mortality and the area at lowest risk when randomly picking out two countries. The MOR can be conceptualized as the median increased risk of mortality that a patient would have if he or she moved to a country with a higher risk [29]. For the purpose of this analysis, countries that included fewer than 30 patients were excluded to avoid spurious findings in reliability-adjusted models. We performed two sensitivity analyses: first, using data from the countries that participated in all four studies, and second, including only patients with invasive ventilation from the beginning of ventilatory support.",

For this purpose, a multivariate logistic regression model was performed for each management strategy.

The mediation analysis assumes a causal relationship between the exposure (period of time) and mediator variables (NPPV, sedation, lung-protective strategy) which in turn may affect the outcome (28-day mortality), and it clarifies the nature of the relationship between the exposure and mediator to better understand the pathways by which the exposure potentially affects the outcome [30]. Therefore, we performed the mediation analysis using the inverse odds ratio weighting method to estimate the direct effect of time on 28-day mortality and the effect, on 28-day mortality, that is mediated by the use of NPPV, sedation and the lung-protective strategy (indirect effect). We calculated direct and indirect effects of each period using inverse odds weighting, which is a semi-parametric weight-based approach to mediation analysis, implemented with standard software. This method can accommodate multiple mediators [31, 32]. Standard errors for the indirect effect were estimated using bootstrapping. For this mediation analysis, we considered two clinical approaches: first, in the overall cohort of mechanically ventilated patients; second, taking into account that the application of the above strategies cannot be uniform, since they depend basically on the severity of respiratory failure at initiation of mechanical ventilation. For this reason, we classified the overall cohort into four sub-groups: (a) patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio higher than 300 at the beginning of mechanical ventilation; (b) patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of between 200 and 300; (c) patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of between 100 and 200, and (d) patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio lower than 100.",

Our results also showed a significant geographical variability in 28-day mortality among countries, with the risk of death found to differ up to twofold between any two randomly selected countries. The observed random effect of the international variability in mortality could, itself, be influenced by possible unmeasured variables such as ICU organization and utilization [34, 35], intensive-care resources [36], intensive-care admissions policy, intensivist staffing schedules [37], or variability in the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment across countries [38, 39].

A meta-analysis that included individual patient data from nine randomized clinical trials showed that reductions in the daily fluid balance, plateau pressure and tidal volume, and the increase in PEEP decreased the mortality rate in ARDS patients over a period of 17 years [42]. We performed a mediation analysis to evaluate the effect of the aforementioned management strategies. Despite the methodological complexity, we have found a moderate (lower than 25%) mediated effect of lung-protective strategy and sedation in a subgroup of patients with moderate hypoxemia.",

Despite enrolling a large number of ICUs from around the world, our sample may not have avoided a selection bias liable to limit the generalizability of its findings. However, given that 60% of our sample was collected from countries that participated in all four studies, as well as the fact that it covered a time span of almost 20 years, its results can be considered very consistent and reliable. It may also be questioned whether the participating ICUs are sufficiently representative of the countries. We are confident that the availability and use of health resources within each country, including the socioeconomic and demographic aspects of patients, showed similar random distribution. Another limitation is that we did not have all the same ICUs participating in all four studies. To some extent, this was unavoidable due to closure of some previously participating hospitals, changes in resources available for data collection at participating centers, and our goal to expand the representability of the results by including ICUs from more countries. Finally, we had missing data for some relevant variables; however, we believe that the size of the database should have minimized the influence of the missing information in the results. In this sense, we analyzed the evolution over time of tidal volume expressed as the tidal volume in milliliters per kilogram of actual body weight, because height was not registered in the first study. Some may argue that the data on tidal volumes are difficult to interpret given the use of actual body weight instead ideal body weight. However, the differences between actual body weight and ideal body weight were found to decrease slightly over time (13.69 kg in 2004, 12.91 kg in 2010, and 11.97 kg in 2016), which resulted in only minor differences between tidal volume estimated by actual or predicted body weight (1.46 ml in 2004, 1.14 in 2010, and 1.13 in 2016). Therefore, we consider that this possible limitation does not invalidate our observation about the evolution of tidal volume.",
