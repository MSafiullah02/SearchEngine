            "text": "Rumors and conspiracy theories thrive in environments of low confidence and low trust. Consequently, it is not surprising that Covid-19 related rumors and conspiracy theories are proliferating. This phenomenon is particularly acute given the lack of any authoritative scientific consensus on the virus, its spread and containment, or on the long term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating on social media and in the news are ones suggesting that the 5G network activates the virus or causes physiological change that can kill, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using the pandemic to launch a global surveillance regime under cover of vaccination. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of property, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, and demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders countermand such conclusions. Rumors and conspiracy theories about the pandemic pose a significant threat not only to democratic institutions such as a free, open and trusted press, but also to the physical well-being of the citizenry. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of these stories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling rumors and conspiracy theories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real-time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.",

            "text": "As the Covid-19 pandemic continues its unrelenting global march, stories about its origins, possible cures, and appropriate responses are tearing through social media and dominating the news cycle. While many of the stories arXiv:2004.13783v1 [cs.CL] 28 Apr 2020 in the news media are the product of fact-based reporting, many of those circulating on social media are anecdotal and the product of speculation, wishful thinking, or conspiratorial fantasy. Given the lack of a strong scientific and governmental consensus on how to combat the virus, people are turning to informal information sources such as social media to share their thoughts and experiences, and to discuss possible responses. At the same time, the news media is reporting on the actions individuals and groups are taking across the globe, including ingesting home remedies or defying stay at home orders, and on the information motivating those actions. 1 Consequently, news and social media have become closely intertwined, with informal and potentially misleading stories entangled with fact-based reporting: social media posts back up claims with links to news stories, while the news reports on stories trending on social media. To complicate matters, not all sites purporting to be news media are reputable, while reputable sites have reported unsubstantiated or inaccurate information. Because of the very high volume of information circulating on and across these platforms, and the speed at which new information enters this information ecosystem, fact-checking organizations have been overwhelmed. The chief operating officer of Snopes, for example, has pointed out that, \"[there] are rumors and grifts and scams that are causing real catastrophic consequences for people at risk. . . It's the deadliest information crisis we might ever possibly have,\" and notes that his group and others like it are \"grossly unprepared\" [36] .",

Such methods could be used to support fact checking organizations, and help identify and deter the spread of misleading stories; ultimately, they may help prevent people from making potentially catastrophic decisions, such as self-medicating with chloroquine phosphate, bleach or alcohol, or resisting efforts at containment that require participation by an entire citizenry. 2 As decades of research into folklore has shown, stories such as those circulating on social media, however anecdotal, are not created from whole cloth, but rely on existing stories, story structures, and conceptual frameworks that inform the world view of individuals and their broader cultural groups [62] [41] [54] [59] . Taken together, these three features (a shared world view, a reservoir of existing stories, and a shared understanding of story structure) allow people to easily generate stories acceptable to their group, and to try to convince others to see the world as they do.",

[58] We also borrow from George Boole's famous definition of a domain of discourse, recognizing that in any such domain there are informal and constantly negotiated limits on what can be said [9] . We conceptualize a narrative framework as a network comprising the actants (people, organizations, places and things) and their interactant relationships that are activated in any storytelling related to the pandemic, be it a journalistic account or an informal anecdote [60] [58] . In this model of story telling, individuals activate a small subset of the available actants and interactant relationships that exist in a discourse domain.",

            "text": "By applying the narrative framework discovery pipeline to tens of thousands of social media posts and news stories, all centered on conspiracy theories related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we uncover five central phenomena: (i) the attempt to incorporate the pandemic into well-known conspiracy theories, such as Q-Anon; (ii) the emergence of new conspiracy theories, such as one suggesting that the 5G cellular network is the root cause of the virus; (iii) the alignment of various conspiracy theories to form larger ones, such as one suggesting that Bill Gates is using the virus as a cover for his desire to create a worldwide surveillance state through the enforcement of a global vaccination program, thereby aligning it with anti-vaxx conspiracy theories; (iv) the nucleation of potential conspiracy theories that may grow into a larger theory or be subsumed in one of the existing or emerging theories; and (v) the interaction of these conspiracy theories with the news, where certain factual events, such as the setting up of tents in Central Park for a field hospital, are linked to the Q-Anon conspiracy theory that includes aspects of child sex-trafficking, underground tunnels, and Hollywood stars best known in recent years from the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. 1 The broad scale use of hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for the virus, which first gained a foothold in social media, is only one example of this feedback loop in action [49] . Numerous other claims, despite being repeatedly shown to be false, persist in part because of this close connection between social media and the news. [6] 2 An Arizona man died from using an aquarium additive that contained chloroquine phosphate as a source of chloroquine, a potential \"miracle cure\" touted by various sources, including the president [63] . Several poison control centers had to make press releases warning people not to drink or gargle with bleach [12] . The governor of Nairobi included small bottles of cognac in the Covid-19 care kits distributed to citizens, erroneously indicating that WHO considers alcohol a \"throat sanitizer\" [21] .",

From a machine learning perspective, given this text data, we need to estimate all the hidden parameters of the model: the actants, the contexts, the set of relationships, and the edges and their labels. In other words, it is necessary to jointly estimate all the parameters of the different layers of the model. We summarize this process below, while the code is available on our github repository. 5 First, each sentence in our corpus is processed to extract various patterns of syntax relationship tuples. These tuples are described as (arg 1 , rel, arg 2 ) where each arg i is a noun phrase and rel is a verb or other type of phrase. Our relations extraction framework combines dependency parse tree and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) [15] tools used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). We design sets of relationship patterns that are important in articulating narratives, and extract them from the parsed outputs of the NLP models.",

This list of named entities then acts as a seed list to start the process of creating CGs from the noun phrases. In particular, we group nouns in the NER list using co-occurrence information from phrases; for example, \"corona\" and \"virus\" tend to appear in phrases together. Table 1 shows examples of CGs. In prior work [58] , we have shown that the final network comprising sub-nodes (see below) and their relationship edges is not sensitive to the exact size and content of the contextual groups derived at this stage. This CG grouping, which we apply prior to applying k-Means clustering on word embedding (see below), enables us to distill the noun phrases into groups of phrases that have a semantic bias. This distillation mitigates the inherent noise issues with word embeddings when they are directly used to cluster heterogeneous sets of words over a large corpus [48] . The CGs can also be viewed as defining macro-contexts in the underlying generative narrative framework.",

Because of the limited availability of consistently time-stamped data, our current comparison between the social media conspiracy theory narrative frameworks, and those appearing in the news, is limited to a three week window.",

It is worth noting that several of the communities are \"meta-narrative\" communities, and describe either the social media platform or linguistic peculiarities of communications on that platform (e.g. community 34), the background for the discussion itself (e.g. community 10 which focuses on Italy, one of the European hot-spots for the virus, or community 31 which focuses on medical equipment such as masks and ventilators), or other platform specific discussions (e.g. communities 4 and 11 which focus on Facebook and YouTube respectively). These background and \"meta-narrative\" communities, after thresholding, tend to be quite small, with an average of 3.6 subnodes per community. Nevertheless, several of them include subnodes with very high NER scores, such as community 6, with only two nodes, \"Corona virus\" and \"virus\", meaning this community is very likely to be included as part of more elaborated conspiracy theory narrative frameworks. The five largest communities, in contrast, range in size from 26 to 66 nodes. These five communities, along with several other large communities, form the main reservoir of actants and interactant relationships for the creation of conspiracy theory narrative frameworks.",

For example, looking solely within a moderately sized community in the graph, such as community 32 with ten subnodes, one can easily see the connection that the members of these forums have made between the cold symptoms caused by the virus and the \"film your hospital\" movement (See Figure 2 ). This movement encourages people to film their local hospitals as \"proof\" that the hospitals are neither overcrowded nor being inundated with acutely ill virus sufferers, and has been compared to the \"truther\" movement that challenged the legitimacy of Barack Obama's birth certificate [56] . Consequently, subnodes from this community are activated in the context of narrative frameworks based on these \"truther\" type conspiracy theories, and the narrative frameworks that propose that the pandemic is largely a hoax.",

Intriguingly, this small selection of nodes also brings in the 5G node, which is an important node for a separate narrative framework that joins together cellular networks and microwaves as key technologies for activating the virus as a biological weapon. It also brings in the Bill Gates node; Gates is a key actant in a narrative framework suggesting that his support for widespread vaccination programs is a cover for his alleged desire for a global surveillance apparatus (See Table 3 ).

Each edge in this subgraph can be labeled, providing alternate pathways across the subgraph.

Some of these are likely to be subsumed by the main competing conspiracy theory narrative frameworks as the process of framework alignment-a key aspect of the totalizing nature of conspiracy theories, which attempt to fit all events into a single belief framework-comes into play. This monological thinking appears to be at work in the alignment of the 5G conspiracy theory with the biological weapons conspiracy theory, with both of those frameworks sharing close connections with the narrative framework describing the pandemic as a whole. They also emphasize the role that Trump, the military, and the state of Washington all play in the outbreak.",

They then use this information to generate \"authoritative\" links between disparate domains, engaging in what Goertzel has labeled \"monological thinking\" [25] .",

Although news media have paid considerable attention to the well-known Q-Anon conspiracy theory (perhaps the most capacious of conspiracy theories of the Trump presidency), the social media conversations have focused on four main conspiracy theories: (i) the virus as related to the 5G network, explaining both the Chinese provenance of the virus through the connection to the communications giant Huawei; (ii) the release, either accidental or deliberate of the virus from, alternately, a Chinese laboratory or an unspecified military laboratory, and its role as a bio-weapon; (iii) the perpetration of a hoax by a globalist cabal in which the virus is no more dangerous than a mild flu or the common cold; and (iv) the use of the pandemic as a covert operation supported by Bill Gates to develop a global surveillance regime facilitated by widespread vaccination. As the conversations evolve, these conspiracy theories appear to be connecting to one another, and may eventually form a single coherent conspiracy theory that encompasses all of these actants. At the same time, smaller nucleations of emerging conspiracy theories can be seen in the overall social media narrative framework graph.",

We have shown that a pipeline of interlocking computational methods, based on sound narrative theory, can provide a clear overview of the underlying generative frameworks for these narratives.",
