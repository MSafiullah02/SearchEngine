The first\nenzymatic activation step is stereoselective, leading to widely different\nbiological activity based on the stereochemistry at the phosphorus\ncenter. The need to selectively synthesize pure diastereomers of the\nProTides has led to much progress in the synthesis, but the ability\nto make pure diastereomers depends on the isolation of diastereomerically\npure precursors such as compound 1. Previous efforts\nhave utilized differential crystallization or chiral column chromatography\nto prepare these chiral precursors. While these efforts have proven\nto be successful, they are difficult and time-consuming. As an alternative\napproach, diastereometrically pure precursors can be obtained by enzymatic\nresolution. In this approach, the undesired isomer is preferentially\nhydrolyzed by a stereoselective enzyme. The PTE mutant G60A-PTE displays\nan \u223c165-fold preference for the RP isomer of compound 1, allowing the SP isomer to be easily isolated. The In1W-PTE variant exhibits\neven higher selectivity with a 1400-fold preference for the SP isomer, making the isolation of the RP isomer relatively straightforward. The hydrophobic\nnature of compound 1 allows for the facile recovery of\nthe desired isomer via simple organic extraction on a preparative\nscale. Combining this enzymatic methodology with the regioselective\nsynthesis methods developed by others will greatly simplify the preparation\nof diasteromerically pure ProTides of either stereochemistry.",
