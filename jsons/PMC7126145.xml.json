It is a reversible but recurrent chronic inflammatory disorder that characteristically causes severe dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing.13 There are 2 main problems in asthma: chronically inflamed airways and hyperresponsive airways. Intermittent airflow obstruction in symptomatic patients results in decreased ability to expire, leading to hyperinflation, stenting open the alveoli, and increasing the work of breathing. Early in an exacerbation, symptoms are bronchospastic secondary to smooth muscle contraction. As an episode progresses, inflammatory changes in the airways can cause increased airway resistance and lead to VQ mismatch (Fig. 11\n). The severity of an exacerbation can be assessed clinically and should dictate how aggressively a patient is treated (Table 6\n).",

In the emergent setting, clinicians must treat the airflow limitation. As with asthma, monitoring of pulse oximetry, degree of respiratory distress, and hemodynamic stability can help clinicians anticipate the degree of severity of a particular exacerbation. More specific testing may also have a role, because radiographs and electrocardiograms may help differentiate other causes of shortness of breath from a COPD exacerbation. In addition, an increase in sputum production or the presence of purulent sputum should be treated with antibiotics, regardless of other infectious symptoms.14\n",

It was associated with some vague nausea and she says that she just does not feel good. Angina pectoris is cardiac chest pain in which oxygen demand outweighs myocardial oxygen supply; in this case caused by occlusion of coronary arteries. Although typically chest pain is a part of the presentation, dyspnea alone may be the initial complaint, termed an anginal equivalent. In one recent large series of patients undergoing stress testing, patients with dyspnea alone were at increased risk of death from cardiac causes. Patients asked simply whether they experienced shortness of breath were considered dyspneic. The subset with no prior known coronary artery disease had more than 4 times the risk of sudden cardiac death versus asymptomatic patients and more than twice the risk of those with typical angina.31 Clinicians should consider past medical history and risk factors when assessing dyspnea for cardiac causes such as acute myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Appropriate testing includes bedside electrocardiogram, troponin, and chest radiograph.",

Typically only a thin serous layer exists between the visceral and parietal pleura.

Both the rate and the depth of ventilation often increase, leading to both tachypnea and hyperpnea, at times referred to as Kussmaul respirations. This compensatory response is crucial for survival and should not be mistaken for dyspnea. It is equally important to realize that an increase in alveolar ventilation is not always a compensatory response (to acidosis or to primary pulmonary disorders) and hypocapnia may cause primary respiratory alkalosis, from central nervous system compromise, toxins (eg, salicylates), anxiety, or pain.34 In these patients, imaging rarely reveals a source of dyspnea, but clinical suspicion based on history and examination, including signs such as the fruity breath of ketonemia, the pallor of anemia, or the cyanosis of toxic hemoglobinopathies, directs providers toward appropriate laboratory testing and treatment.",
