The infected patients often develop severe symptoms, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4. The H7N9 infection had caused 1230 confirmed human cases, with 428 deaths by 22 February 2017 [data from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)]. The severe symptoms and high mortality associated with H7N9 infection pose a big threat to the public health. Although recent studies of H7N9 have achieved great progress, clear definition of the host immunological responses to H7N9 is still lacking1, 5, 6.",

A rapid antiviral response, i.e. type I interferon production, to facilitate intracellular control of viral replication; and a proinflammatory response characterized by secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which promotes recruitment of various immune cells for viral clearance8. As a key mediator of inflammation, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various diseases9. The maturation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 require a protein complex called inflammasome, which activates caspase-1 to cleave proIL-1\u03b2 to its mature form10. More importantly, caspase-1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome have been found essential for protecting mice against H1N1 IAV infection11\u201313.",

            "text": "It has been reported that H1N1 RNA plays a critical role in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome11. To assess whether the NLRP3 inflammasome could be activated during H7N9 challenge, we transfected LPS-primed BMDCs (bone marrow derived dendritic cells) with H7N9 RNA and measured the production of IL-1\u03b2. As expected, robust IL-1\u03b2 secretion was detected in the H7N9 RNA-transfected samples, while the production of an inflammasome-independent cytokine TNF-\u03b1 was unaltered (Fig. 1a), suggesting that H7N9 RNA-induced IL-1\u03b2 production was likely dependent on inflammasome activity. To ensure the role of inflammasome in H7N9 RNA-mediated induction of IL-1\u03b2, we generated BMDCs from Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212, Asc\n\u2212/\u2212 and Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. Transfection of LPS-primed BMDCs from such mice led to significantly compromised IL-1\u03b2 secretion compared to wild type controls (Fig. 1b). And western blotting revealed that caspase-1 activation and ASC oligomerization were also decreased in BMDCs from Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 and Asc\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1c), which might account for the compromised IL-1\u03b2 production. Thus, our results suggest that H7N9 RNA activates caspase-1 via the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse dendritic cells.\n",

To this end, age and gender matched WT, Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 and Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with H7N9 virus as described15. We found that the Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice survived significantly better than the WT controls (Fig. 2a). Consistently, the mortality of Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice was also significantly lower compared to WT controls 14 days post infection (d.p.i) (Fig. 2b). In terms of body weight changes, Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice had less weight loss compared to WT controls (P < 0.01 at 3, 7, 8 d.p.i) (Fig. 2c). Moreover, WT mice lost significantly more body weights than Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice from 3 to 7 d.p.i (P < 0.01 at 3 d.p.i and P < 0.05 at other time points) (Fig. 2d). However, on 10 d.p.i the survived WT mice began to recover quicker than Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. The gain of body weight started at 7 d.p.i for WT but 8 d.p.i. for Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. By 14 d.p.i, WT mice returned to the initial level of body weight but the Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice did not (Fig. 2d). Notably, no significant difference for H7N9 viral quantity in the lungs was observed between the infected Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 or Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 vs. WT mice (Fig. 2e,f).\n",

On 3 d.p.i, infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the infected lungs of all strains of mice. There was an obvious thickening of alveolar septum, destruction of partial alveolar structure, as well as pulmonary septal rupture (Fig. 3a and c). However, infiltration of inflammatory cells to the lungs of WT mice was much more severe than that in Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 or Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, especially in the bronchus. In addition, the destruction of alveolar structure in the lungs of Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 and Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice was weaker than that in WT mice (Fig. 3a and c). On 7 d.p.i, all strains of mice showed more severe infiltration of inflammatory cells to the lungs comparing to that on 3 d.p.i (Fig. 3b and c). Nonetheless, the pulmonary pathology of Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 and Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice was still milder than that in WT mice on 7 d.p.i (Fig. 3b and c). Collectively, these results suggested a role for NLRP3 and caspase-1 in promoting pathological changes in the lungs of mice infected with H7N9.\n",

Therefore, we further studied the impact of caspase-1 deficiency on the infiltration of proinflammatory leukocytes to the lungs after H7N9 infection. The single-cell suspensions, prepared from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of H7N9 infected WT or Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice on 0, 3 and 7 days post infection were stained with anti -CD11b, -F4/80, -CD11c, -Ly6c, -Ly6g, -CD3 and -B220 antibodies conjugated to different fluorescent conjugates, and analyzed through flow cytometry. In both WT and Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, the percentages of leukocytes expressing CD11b, F4/80, CD11c, Ly6c and Ly6g peaked around 3 d.p.i, then declined (Fig. 4a\u2013e). The percentages of F4/80 (74.43% \u00b1 5.027%) and CD11c (54.85% \u00b1 11.50%) positive cells in the WT BALF samples were significantly higher than that in Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 BALF samples (F4/80: 26.48% \u00b1 11.42%; CD11c: 16.52% \u00b1 6.654%) on 3 d.p.i. Meanwhile, the mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of CD11b (4,092 \u00b1 1,409), F4/80 (12,450 \u00b1 3,616) and CD11c (4,270 \u00b1 1,642) in WT BALF cells were significantly increased compared with that of Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (CD11b: 80.10 \u00b1 54.18; F4/80: 531.0 \u00b1 483.4; CD11c: 119.7 \u00b1 94.97) on 3 d.p.i (Fig. 4a\u2013c). For Ly6c and Ly6g, albeit there was no statistical difference between the WT and Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, the percentage was at least more than two folds higher in the WT mice than that in Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice; and the differences of the MFIs in those two groups were even bigger on 3 d.p.i (Fig. 4d and e). For lymphocytes, CD3 positive cells and B220 positive cells showed no significant differences between WT and Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice on both 3 d.p.i and 7 d.p.i (Fig. 4f and g). Thus, deficiency of caspase-1 reduced the proinflammatory leukocytes recruitment to the lungs upon H7N9 IAV challenge.\n",

            "text": "It is reported that the caspase-1, activated by inflammasome, plays a critical role in murine proinflammatory responses to IAV infection11, 12, 16. To investigate the role of caspase-1 in H7N9 infection related inflammation, cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants of lung homogenates were analyzed (Fig. 5). In Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 lung tissues, the levels of IL-1\u03b2 (118.8 \u00b1 30.68 pg/g tissue) and IL-18 (1.168 \u00b1 0.3761 ng/g tissue) were significantly lower than those in WT tissues (IL-1\u03b2: 309.5 \u00b1 28.54 pg/g; IL-18: 2.856 \u00b1 0.3617 ng/g, respectively) on 7 d.p.i (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5a). Other cytokines such as IL-12/23p40, IL-1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b2 also exhibited decreased level in Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 lung tissues compared with WT control on either 3 d.p.i or 7 d.p.i, although the differences were not significant (Fig. 5a). The level of IL-6 fluctuates and was lower in the lungs from Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice on 3 d.p.i, but higher on 7 d.p.i compared to WT counterparts, without significant differences in both cases (Fig. 5a). Other cytokines such as IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17 did not show significant differences between tissues from Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice (Fig. 5a). As for the detected chemokines, MIP-1\u03b1 was significantly lower in Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 lung tissues than that in WT control on 3 d.p.i (P < 0.05). The levels of other chemokines, including MIP-1\u03b2, IP-10, CXCL1, CCL2 and GM-CSF were just slightly lower in the lungs of Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice than that in WT counterparts on either 3 d.p.i or 7 d.p.i. Therefore, caspase-1 was involved for an optimal production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 as well as MIP-1\u03b1 in the lung in response to H7N9 challenge. To note, the production of above mentioned cytokines and chemokines from Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a similar pattern as that from Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5b), indicating that deficiency of NLRP3 inflammasome genes reduced the secretion of several critical proinflammatory mediators in the lung of mice upon H7N9 IAV challenge. In addition, the production of these cytokines and chemokines in the serum of Nlrp3\n\u2212/\u2212, Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice showed a similar trend with that from the lung homogenates (Supplementary Fig. S1).\n",

Thus, we set out to determine whether ASC and IL-1R1 play a role similar as that of NLRP3 and caspase-1 during H7N9 IAV infection. To this end, we infected Asc\n\u2212/\u2212 and Il1r1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice with H7N9 virus and monitored their weight change and mortality daily. Our results demonstrated that the mortality of Asc\n\u2212/\u2212 and Il1r1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice was lower compared with that of the WT mice (Fig. 6a). The WT mice also suffered more weight loss than these knock-out animals (from 7 to 10 d.p.i) after H7N9 challenge.

The H7N9 virus was intranasally inoculated and inhaled into bronchoalveolar spaces, then infected the epithelial cells. At the early stage of first few rounds of viral replication (24~72 hours), the local inflammation was limited (Fig. 3a), and macrophages/dendritic cells and a few other cells started to be recruited to the infected area by chemokine MIP-1\u03b1 (Figs 4a\u2013c and 5a). The production of IL-1\u03b2 was still at low level at this stage (Fig. 5a). With the development of disease, at 7 d.p.i., severe inflammation occurred in the infected lung tissue (Fig. 3b). With the migration of the lymphocytes, especially B cells, to the inflammatory area (Fig. 4g), the total number of infiltrated inflammatory cells were increased but the percentage of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells were decreased (Supplementary Fig. S2, Fig. 4). The infiltrated inflammatory cells produced large amount of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5), which accelerated the pulmonary inflammation.",

Microscopic analyses revealed that on 14 d.p.i, most tissues from WT mice exhibited complete recovery, while the Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 tissues still manifested strong inflammation (data not shown). Thus, WT mice suffered more due to the lung damage and inflammation in the early phase (before 7 d.p.i) of H7N9 infection and either died of organ failure, or recovered at the later phase. In contrast, Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212mice did not develop as strong inflammation and lung damage as seen in WT counterparts in the early phase, consequently fewer of them died. However, Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to recover completely at the later phase. These results might suggest a potentially dual role for caspase-1 in H7N9 infection, detrimental role to the host upon H7N9 infection before 7 d.p.i. and possibly necessary role for recovery from the lung inflammation after 7 d.p.i. phase, likely due to a contribution to tissue regeneration. But it should be kept in mind that the comparison between 20% surviving WT and 60% surviving Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 is not justified, and more stringent experiments are needed for further explorations on the role of caspase-1 to host recovery.",

            "text": "Studies on the role of NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome during IAV infection produced conflicting results. Some studies have demonstrated that NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome is protective against H1N1 infection through viral clearance or virus induced pulmonary necrosis11, 12\n. Inflammation is essential to protect host from infection, but can also cause tissue damage or dysfunction of important organs and lead to death21. Dysregulation of the proinflammatory response may result in a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that contributes to a severe viral pneumonia and serious complications in the lung21. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 causes hypercytokinemia and severe tissue damage22. It is reported that production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6 and IP-10, is remarkably increased in H7N9 infected patients17, 23, and H7N9 infection associated inflammation in the lungs resulted in rapidly progressive pneumonia and development of ARDS in the majority of hospitalized patients24, 25. In addition, the H5N1 IAV infected patients who progressed severe lung injury have elevated levels of CCL2, IP-10, CXCL9 and IL-8 compared with the seasonal H1N1 infected patients26. Therefore, for the highly pathogenic influenza virus the hyperactivated proinflammatory responses may be detrimental for the host. Moreover, a recent study demonstrates that NLRP3 inflammasome plays both a protective and detrimental role during H1N1 and H3N2 infection of mice depending on the disease phase13. In our study, we found the inflammasome activation was deleterious in the case of H7N9 infection, possibly due to overwhelming and fatal acute inflammation in the lungs following H7N9 infection. Pathology and infiltrating cellular analyses as well as cytokine and chemokine analyses all supported this possibility (Figs 3\u20135). Pathology results revealed that on 3 d.p.i, there were more inflammatory cells around the blood vessels and bronchus in WT mice compared with Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3). The flow cytometric analyses further demonstrated the abundance of inflammatory cells in the BALF of WT mice compared to Casp1/11\n\u2212/\u2212 counterparts (Fig. 4), which were consistent with the observed pulmonary pathological changes.",

IL-1\u03b2 is a critical proinflammatory cytokine that is increased during infections with H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses29. IL-1\u03b2 also mediates the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils into the lung30. Deficiency of IL-1\u03b2 or its receptors manifests different responses to respiratory challenge with influenza virus31\u201333. Hence, the function of IL-1\u03b2 in controlling IAV infections remains obscure. Our data showed that Il1r1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited attenuated tissue pathogenesis upon H7N9 infection (Figs 6 and 7).",
