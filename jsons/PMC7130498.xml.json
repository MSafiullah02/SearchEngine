            "text": "During the last 20 years, there have been numerous publications concerned with bereavement counselling services in Western countries (MacCarthy and MacKeith, 1965; Beem et al., 1998; Gardner, 1999; Gensch and Midland, 2000; Engler and Lasker, 2000). Gensch and Midland (2000) have been addressing the needs of parents whose babies die during pregnancy or shortly after birth since the early 1980s. The `Resolve through Sharing (RTS) Program' was the first well-developed model. They use it to support bereaved couples and families experiencing pregnancy or perinatal loss. In 1982, Gardner (1982) developed a questionnaire to assess the needs and feelings of 44 nurses who cared for bereaved parents. One year later, Gardner (1983) surveyed 100 couples that had experienced stillbirth. Her study revealed that the most helpful care practices were the ones least used by the nurses who cared for them. Another important resource for bereavement care services was written in 1986 by Limbo and Wheeler (1998). It is considered the `Bible' for newcomers interested in this area of nursing. Pregnancy and childbirth are times of great joy and rejoicing, and women generally approach motherhood with happiness. Because it is usually sudden and contrary to the expected pattern of events, a perinatal loss can be considered particularly traumatic for women who experience it (Symes, 1991). Induced or spontaneous pregnancy loss may cause sustained psychological morbidity (Lewis, 1976; Lloyd and Laurence, 1985). It is likely that the attitudes of medical and nursing staff can influence recovery from a pregnancy loss and that nurses with a positive attitude to bereavement care can help bereaved families to cope during their grieving period (Lewis, 1976).",

            "text": "In 1999, more than 50,000 babies were born in Hong Kong. Sadly, in that year, the perinatal mortality rate was 5.7 per 1000 total births (Hospital Authority, 2003). Consequently, many hospitals in Hong Kong set-up grief counselling and support teams composed of physicians, nurses and clinical psychologists. The role of these units is to offer bedside emotional support (care) to bereaved couples. The support service facilitates the recovery of bereaved couples going through the period of grieving. This is congruent with the organizational mission of the units, which is to enhance quality patient-centred services through teamwork. However, caring for and supporting parents whose baby has died is extremely demanding, difficult and stressful (Nussbaumer and Russell, 2003; Billson and Tyrrell, 2003). Therefore, nurses involved in the care and support of bereaved parents need to be trained with the relevant knowledge, skills and understanding to acquire sufficient confidence in their ability to provide adequate and appropriate care (de Groot-Boll\u00fcjt and Mourik, 1993). It is recommended that pre-registration, post-registration and in-service training be provided for nurses who will care for those who have lost a baby. Thus, special skills are needed to help bereaved parents. After appropriate training, it is logical to assume that nurses are better equipped to cope with perinatal bereavement (Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society, 1991). In dealing with bereavement care, the most important attitude is caring. The attitudes of nurses can affect the quality of care provided to support bereaved parents and families experiencing perinatal loss. Nursing care may not be based on individual care, but rather on the attitudes of nurses (Shaw and Heyman, 1982). When nurses provide bereavement care, negative attitudes may distract from the provision of good care; whilst positive attitudes can help bereaved couples to cope with the grieving process and create memories for the future. This study was undertaken to address the paucity of information available on nurses' attitudes towards perinatal bereavement support in Hong Kong. This quantitative study was conducted with the aim of helping to fill this gap and the findings may provide valuable baseline information for future studies.",

In this study, a structured self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data. Permission was obtained from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Prior to the study, an information sheet was given to all nurses explaining the purpose and procedures of the survey. In order to answer any possible questions that potential participants might have about the study, a contact person and telephone number were provided. All participants were asked to sign a consent form attached to the questionnaire. Participants were told that all information would be treated confidentially. Names and staff IDs were not indicated on the returned questionnaires. The questionnaire was distributed to nurses at their work place through their ward managers. Instructions were given to complete and return the questionnaire to the researcher by mail within one week. Totally 125 questionnaires were sent out, 110 were completed and returned, for a response rate of 88%.",

            "text": "An intensive study of the existing literature describing nurses' attitudes towards perinatal bereavement revealed 21 items considered to be important to train nurses for caring and supporting bereaved parents and families. Conceptually, three dimensions could be distinguished. A panel of experts (a nurse specialist, a senior medical officer and a clinical psychologist) established content validity. A pilot study was performed with five nurses working in the OAG of a hospital other than the target hospital. After the pilot and repeated discussions with the expert panel, three aspects of the questionnaire were confirmed: (1) nurses' attitudes towards perinatal bereavement support, (2) the importance of hospital policy, and (3) training on perinatal bereavement support. The content validity indices (CVI) ranged from 0.78 to 0.89 for sub-aspects, with an overall score of 0.86. Shelley (1984) stated that a CVI below 0.50 for a measure indicated an unacceptable level of content validity. Since these values were greater than this level, the measure was deemed acceptable. Respondents were asked to rank each item, in each part, on 5 point Likert-type scales. Part one comprised demographic data (i.e., age, education level, recent ranking and religious background), experience aspects (i.e., personal grieving, handling grieving clients and years of work in the OAG unit) and training aspects (i.e., midwifery and bereavement care). This information provides knowledge about participants, and is used to determine differences between or within groups related to the data obtained (i.e., attitude scores). Part two comprised 9 attitude statements formulated to measure nurses' general attitudes towards bereavement care (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree). Part three is composed of two sections; the first section comprised four statements to evaluate nurses' attitudes on the importance of hospital policy on perinatal bereavement (1=very unimportant, 5=very important). The second section comprised eight statements to evaluate nurses' attitudes on the importance of formal training to deal with perinatal bereavement care (1=very unimportant, 5=very important). For all statements in part two, a high score indicates a positive and favourable attitude towards perinatal bereavement support. In part three, a high score indicates attitudes that are highly influenced by policy and a high demand for nurses with perinatal bereavement care training.",

A cluster analysis was used to group the study sample into several groups. This analysis, also called segmentation or taxonomy analysis, is a way to create groups of objects, or clusters in such a way that the profiles or characteristics of nurses in the same cluster are very similar and that the profiles of nurses in different clusters are quite distinct (Chan et al., 2003). In this study, the analysis was based on four main variables: (1) demographic variables; (2) attitudes towards bereavement care variables; (3) attitudes on the importance of hospital policy on perinatal bereavement variables; and (4) attitudes on the importance of formal training to deal with perinatal bereavement care variables. The analysis used standardized values (z) based on these variables. Two-step cluster analysis was used for this study. In this technique, nurses are sequentially merged into a decreasing number of clusters until the conjoint set contains all nurses (SPSS Inc., 2002). The choice of a similarity measure and the determination of the number of clusters were based on the Log-likelihood distance and Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion (BIC), respectively (SPSS Inc., 2002). Differences between the cluster groups were delineated descriptively. Due to ordinal data and skewed patterns in most of the outcomes, Chi-square test and Mann\u2013Whitney U-test were used to test differences in various nurses' characteristics between the clusters (Hall-Lord et al., 1999). In addition, factor analysis was used to identify the number of factors, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients were used to examine the internal reliability of each part of the instrument. Spearman's correlation coefficients (r\ns) were used to quantify the relationship between the three attitude scores. Results were considered significantly different at p<0.05.",

Nurses in cluster B were more prepared with the knowledge needed to handle/carry out bereavement care, while nurses in cluster A were `green' in this area and needed more training and support.

Attitudes are influential in determining behaviour (Todman and Jauncey, 1986). It is believed that a greater awareness and knowledge of grief counselling would lead to more sympathy, understanding and practical help from nurses. In this study, nurses in cluster A urgently needed training and institutional support. Recently, Hong Kong's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis showed the significant impact that a lack of institutional support, including additional training, as well as resource limitations and heavy workload can have as they result in major sources of job stress. In such an environment, bereavement care is necessary, but produces uncertainty, anxiety and often frustration for nurses.",

Hong Kong health care professionals may use these findings to improve the support of nurses, to ensure the delivery of sensitive bereavement care in the perinatal setting, and to enhance curricula in schools of nursing.

One potential limitation is that data for this study used a self-report questionnaire, which may cause possible response bias from each responder (Polit and Hungler, 1995). Second, sample sizes chosen in this study were relatively small and were restricted to one hospital only. Thus, the results cannot represent the attitudes of all classes of nurses in Hong Kong. Truly, this study can be seen as a pilot study only. Further study should proceed at other hospitals. Third, respondent honesty (or lack thereof) is a potential source of error in self-report surveys (Siegel et al., 1998; James et al., 1991). Although replies did not include the names or staff IDs of individual nurses, they might have perceived pressure from senior management or the hospital to respond. This might account for the high response rate seen in this study and for the positive attitudes given in their responses. To reduce such errors, face-to-face interviews could be a better method to improve the accuracy of the results but it is more costly in terms of time, manpower, and money (Oei and Zwart, 1986). Further research is needed to explore common feelings and coping behaviours of bereaved parents in caring programmes offered by nurses working in OAG units.",
