As elegantly presented by Andrea Remuzzi and Giuseppe Remuzzi,3 a rapid surge of cases is posing a serious threat to the Italian national health system because of the limited capacity of intensive care unit departments. The Italian Government introduced progressive mitigation measurements on March 9 and March 11, 2020, to drastically limit social interactions and prevent virus diffusion.4, 5 Projections in Remuzzi and Remuzzi's exponential model,2 which, according to data trends before March 8, predicted more than 30 000 cases by March 15, 2020. Real data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University suggest a slight deviation from those predictions, with a recorded number of 24 747 cases by March 15, 2020, suggesting that measures introduced by March 11, 2020, began reducing the number of new cases within 3\u20134 days.",
