There are some individuals who remain seronegative despite high risk and/or multiple exposures to HIV-1 [4], [6]. Although several factors have been related to HIV-1 infection resistance, the possible genetic mechanism underlying this resistance is the homozygous presence of a 32 bp deletion in CCR5 gene (CCR5 \u039432), i.e. the main co-receptor used by the macrophage (M)-tropic strain of the virus to infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells [5].",

            "text": "The dendritic cell receptor, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin, encoded by CD209) is a type II membrane associated C-type lectin that binds HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 in a CD4-independent manner and function as a Trojan horse to enhance trans-virus infection to host cells [6]. DC-SIGN is of particular interest because it recognizes a plethora of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiela pneumonia, HIV-1, Ebola virus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, SARS-coronavirus and parasites like Leishmania pifanoi and Schistosoma mansoni\n[7]. Cotransfection of DC-SIGN with HIV-1 demonstrated 95\u201399.5% inhibition of viral production from host cells and can also effectively inhibit 90\u201395% of HIV-1 generation from infected cell [8]. DC-SIGN is organized into 3 domains: an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a neck region containing 7 tandem repeats of the 23 amino acid sequence, and a C-terminal domain with homology to C-type lectins [9]. The neck region of DC-SIGN may be important in determining the orientation of the carbohydrate-binding C-type lectin domain and may therefore have an impact on ligand specificity [10]. Polymorphism analysis of the numbers of repeats present in this neck region suggested that tandem repeats in the neck region are variable and predominantly consisted of 7 repeats among the Caucasians [11]. However, novel variations in the DC-SIGN repeat region were identified which were rare. Cohort studies of HIV-1 seronegative, HIV-1 seropositive and repeatedly exposed seronegative individuals suggest that heterozygosity in the DC-SIGN repeat region may have protective effect on transmission of HIV-1 [12] whereas no associations could be established in recent studies on Thais individuals [13].",

Since, CCR5 delta 32 mutation is presently considered to be most relevant in conferring resistance against HIV-1 infection, the individuals having CCR5 delta 32 allele were excluded from the study. Analysis of DC-SIGN genetic variants in our studied North Indian population revealed the presence of 2 alleles and 2 genotypes of 7/7 and 7/8 type. Our data demonstrate that polymorphism in the DC-SIGN repeat region is rare and frequency of this mutant allele is < 1%, which is in agreement with the previous studies [7]. Although rare among Indians, this allele was present among most of the family members of HIV-1 seronegative heterozygous individual. The restricted nature of this mutation with low level heteorozygosity suggests its recent evolutionary origin and reduced fitness of any allele other than 7-repeat allele in North Indian population [7]. Association studies correlating the HIV-1 susceptibility with DC-SIGN neck repeat polymorphism revealed that insertion of extra repeat in the DC-SIGN neck region i.e. 7/8 have no impact on HIV-1 susceptibility, which is in agreement with the Wichukchinda et al. studies in Thais population [13]. Moreover, our results were also in agreement with Liu et al studies that confirmed the addition of a repeat does not influence the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. In contrast, it is conceivable that the deletion of a repeat can play role in preventing the transmission of HIV-1 infection. Sequence analyses of DC-SIGN repeat region from randomly selected twenty-five North Indian individuals revealed four novel single nucleotide genetic variants, which were not described earlier in NCBI database. Genetic variants in intronic region of DC-SIGN gene (three substitutions and one insertion) reported here revealed that the North Indian population had very different allelic pattern. In addition, since these variants are present in an intronic region, it is conceivable that they influence the splicing and thus the transition from the nuclear heterogeneous RNA to the mRNA of DC-SIGN.",
