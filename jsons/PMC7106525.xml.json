Starting from 1891, CSF drainage, whether by means of repeated punctures, the insertion of trocars or catheters on a subarachnoid, lumbar, or cisternal level, with or without concomitant laminectomy, was one of the therapeutic pillars for bacterial meningitis for over a decade. The idea was to reduce the pressure of the CSF and to diminish its bacterial load. Other surgical procedures were also used for therapeutic purposes in the acute phase of meningococcal meningitis, including suboccipital decompression with the aim of ensuring the permanent drainage of the cisterna magna and trepanation in various locations. Subsequently, the practice of so-called intrathecal washings was advocated, done with repeated punctures of the subarachnoid space and the subsequent instillation of normal saline, distilled water, or sodium citrate solution.26\n",

On May 17, 1906, Georg Jochmann32 described an equine antimeningococcal serum that protected guinea pigs from intraperitoneal meningococcal infection. Jochmann, who worked in Breslau (Wroclaw, in present-day Poland), had been experimenting with this serum since 1905, when the meningococcal disease epidemic still persisted in Upper Silesia (now part of Poland). The antimeningococcal serum was administered to 38 patients from Breslau and to 17 from Ratibor, and the results obtained were presented at the Internal Medicine Congress held in Munich, in April, 1906. 12 of the 17 patients from Ratibor presented a clinical benefit. This paper drew attention to the preference for the intrathecal over the subcutaneous route for its administration.",

In a subsequent experiment,34 he injected meningococcal culture intrathecally into ten M rhesus. Five of them were treated, also intrathecally, with the previously obtained serum, whereas the other five animals were used as controls. All the controls died, but four of the animals treated with homologous antimeningococcal serum survived.

Basically, the serum-obtaining procedure consisted of the subcutaneous or intravenous administration of increasing doses of initially dead meningococci and, in a subsequent phase, of living organisms. The differences in the results were based on whether or not the researchers immunised the horses with soluble autolytic products of the meningococcal culture, on the age of the strains administered, and on the use of strains from just one or numerous patients. Depending on the era, the success of immunisation of the horses was determined by different methods, including opsonic, complement fixation, agglutination, and animal protection studies with the immune serum.18, 27\n",

The serum, previously heated to 37\u00b0C, was introduced into the spinal canal by means of repeated injections or using a gravity infusion system, consisting of a container and a rubber tube equipped with a shut-off valve.35 After introducing the intrathecal serum, the patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position. In the event of the blocking of the subarachnoid space or when impossible to practise the lumbar puncture, the serum administration was done on a cisternal or ventricular level.36 The daily administration of the serum continued until disappearance of the fever or of the diplococci from the CSF.18 In patients with meningitis, some authors also recommended the simultaneous administration of the serum by the intravenous route at high doses and, in the cases of meningococcal sepsis without meningitis, only intravenous administration.27, 37 Hypersensitivity reactions were the most frequent side-effect following administration of the antimeningococcal serum, occurring in up to 75% of cases.18, 38\n",

The analysis of data from the epidemics outlined in table 1 shows a substantial reduction in the mortality for patients treated with the serum compared with that for untreated patients. However, these were not case-control studies but, rather, they were reports of survival of serum-treated compared with survival of untreated patients in the same meningococcal disease epidemic. Therefore, given the important limitations of the study design, data should be interpreted with great caution. Notwithstanding that limitation, the results were compelling enough, at the time, to settle serum therapy as the treatment of choice for meningococcal disease, and antimeningococcal serum continued to be the standard therapy, being recommended until the 1940s.41\n",

Flexner39 had already shown the existence of cases of meningococcal meningitis in which the strain responsible was shown to be resistant to serum therapy. At the beginning of serum therapy, the serum was prepared with, in an empirical and random manner, cultures of meningococcus isolated from multiple patients. In 1909, Dopter42 described the so-called parameningococci \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, which he isolated from the nasopharynx of individuals who had been in contact with patients affected by meningococcal meningitis, and which were morphologically and culturally identical to classic meningococcus but distinguishable from it because of agglutination reactions. In the same year, Harry Elser and James Huntoon43 specified the biochemical and serological characteristics of meningococcus culture, and the preparation of monovalent and polyvalent serums, the clinical use of which was often sequential, began. At the time of diagnosis, polyvalent serum was used first and, after typing the causal agent, treatment continued with the corresponding monovalent serum.",

The first epidemic due to serogroup B meningococcus resistant to sulphadiazine occurred in the spring of 1963, in the US Naval Training Center of San Diego (CA).78, 79 Shortly afterwards, in Fort Ord (Marina, CA, USA), another epidemic of meningococcal disease occurred, also caused by serogroup B meningococcus; 50% of whose isolates were resistant to sulphamides.80, 81 These findings were reproduced shortly after in the civilian population.82 Therefore, in the USA, sulphamides ceased to be the treatment of choice for meningococcal disease starting from 1965. In 1968, an epidemic was detected caused by sulphamide-resistant N meningitidis in Meknes (Morocco),83 and in 1971\u201372, in S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil).84 The epidemics were caused by serogroup C meningococcus with resistance to sulphamides in 95% of the isolates.84, 85 The geographical dispersion of sulphamide resistance in N meningitidis determined the generalised abandonment of sulphamides and the beginning of the era of treatment with penicillin.",

Only one of the patients died, and all the other patients recovered without sequelae. In the same year, Manson Meads and colleagues87 treated nine patients with similar doses of penicillin and all survived. Despite these results, it was believed that treatment with sulphamides was superior, given that the response to penicillin was slower than to sulphamides, the carrier status remained after treatment, and that treatment with penicillin was difficult because of the need for daily lumbar puncture. In 1952, Mark Lepper and colleagues88 compared treatment with penicillin and with sulfisoxazole in 78 patients with meningococcal meningitis. The doses of penicillin were higher than those previously used86, 87 by the intramuscular or intravenous route, without intrathecal administration. It was concluded that penicillin at high doses was at least as effective as sulfisoxazole for the treatment of meningococcal meningitis and that its intrathecal administration was not essential. The first series of patients with meningococcal meningitis treated with penicillin is summarised in table 3\n.86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91\n",

Therefore, high population immunity caused by the efficacy of the vaccine against transmission and the coverage achieved might herald the removal of meningococcus and meningococcal disease eradication or extinction.142\n",

However, the field was not completely abandoned for meningococcal disease, although greatly restricted to experimental research and isolated clinical experiences.143, 144, 145, 146, 147 Passive antibody therapy for infectious diseases then became limited to infections not treated with antibiotics, such as the treatment and prevention of hepatitis B virus, rabies virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium botulinum, anthrax, Clostridioides difficile colitis, vaccinia virus, echovirus, and enterovirus.148\n",

From these sources, we identified additional records. We also searched some official records of the Prussian and Swiss Governments, and even non-scientific journal articles. Most of the records from governments and non-scientific journals have not been included in this Historical Review. However, reports, manuscripts, and records cited in the bibliographies have been searched as well. All the compiled information has been reviewed as accurately as possible to depict the period between the first clinical descriptions of meningococcal disease to the discovery of its causative agent, and to the evolving ways of therapy against meningococcal disease, from the symptomatic period to the antibiotic therapy and the discovery of vaccines. Our search has inherent limitations due to century-old data sources and some unprecise descriptions.
