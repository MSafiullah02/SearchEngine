An analysis resource is linked to the database which hosts various bioinformatics tools to analyze epitope data as well as to predict de novo epitopes.

Three separate prediction methods were implemented, two of them based on scoring matrices (ARB [7] and SMM [8] ) and one based on an artificial neural network [9, 10] . The three methods were compared using five-fold cross validation on a large dataset comprising nearly 50,000 data points, in which the neural network based predictions outperformed the other two [11] .

Besides outbreaks and sequencing data, information is also lacking regarding influenza epitopes. This knowledge is crucial to predict potential cross-reactive immunity and coverage of new strains by vaccines and diagnostic candidates. To demonstrate the features of IEDB and in response to the global spread of highly virulent H5N1 influenza viruses, we have performed an analysis of influenza A epitope information to: 1) compile all current information regarding antibody and T cell epitopes derived from influenza A and 2) determine possible cross-reactivity among H5N1 avian flu and human flu virus.",

An assessment of these curated records revealed that approximately 600 different epitopes, derived from 58 strains, recognized in 8 different hosts and derived from all flu proteins have been identified and reported in the literature, including several conserved epitopes and a small number of protective ones. The latter are of particular interest as they may confer cross-reactive protection against influenza strains of the avian H5N1 subtype. Significantly, however, this analysis made apparent the fact that: 1) few protective antibody and T cell epitopes are reported in the literature; 2) there is a paucity of antibody epitopes in comparison to T cell epitopes; 3) the number of animal hosts from which the epitopes were defined is limited; 4) the number of epitopes reported for avian influenza strains/subtypes is limited, 5) the number of epitopes reported from proteins other than hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) is limited. In summary, this analysis provides a unique resource to evaluate existing data and to aid efforts in guarding against seasonal and pandemic flu outbreaks.",
