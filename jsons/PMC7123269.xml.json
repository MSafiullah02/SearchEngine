Paralleling societal development, the role and importance of animals in our society has been continually evolving with dogs, cats, and horses leading the way. Dogs and cats are no longer kept for companionship purely; they have grown into family members, for whom highly specialized state-of-the-art medical care is a matter of course. Especially the relationship of people with their dogs is a unique affectionate bond. Also in large animal medicine, the treatment of the individual animal is gaining more and more interest over of the health of the whole population. The increasing clients\u2019 expectations have influenced the level of the service provided. Many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have been adopted from human medicine or developed independently and are widely available for veterinary use. Along with the establishment of veterinary specialty associations, this provided a stimulus for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods and the pursuit of research to perpetually improve clinical practice in veterinary neurology and neurosurgery.",

No research group focused on the systematic workup of this condition in animals, and most publications were confined to case reports or series in the past. Therefore, studies on diagnosis and treatment were heterogeneous and mostly descriptive in nature. Our research group includes scientists and professionals in veterinary diagnostic imaging and neurosurgery with an interest in the pathophysiology and treatment of mammalian brain malformations. Our goal is to understand the pathophysiology of disturbed CNS development including internal hydrocephalus and to develop novel diagnostic tools to aid their diagnosis and treatment.",

Pathological studies documenting changes of the ventricular dimensions and associated clinical signs in canines have been described for almost 100 years (Fankhauser 1959; Dexler 1923). However, the pathomechanism behind the abnormal ventricular distension was largely ignored, and the prognosis was generally assessed as poor. A classification of hydrocephalus was and still is limited to communicating or non-communicating and congenital or acquired forms. From today\u2019s clinical perspective and with the experience of the last 10 years, we are aware of the diversity of underlying pathomechanisms, concurrent defects, and clinical presentations. With increasing experience in diagnosis and treatment of hydrocephalus, determination and observation of subgroups that differ in their potential clinical outcome, complication rate, and long-term survival is essential for the future.",

            "text": " Congenital hydrocephalus is frequently diagnosed in small brachycephalic dog breeds including the Boston terrier, Chihuahua, English bulldog, Maltese, Pug dog, Pekingese, and Yorkshire terrier (Selby et al. 1979; Biel et al. 2013; Shihab et al. 2011; de Stefani et al. 2011). The prevalence of congenital hydrocephalus in cats on the other hand is very low (Nelson et al. 1978; Priester et al. 1970). Despite the existing knowledge of the genetics of hydrocephalus in rodents, knowledge about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that cause canine and feline hydrocephalus is very limited. Some evidence has been found that hydrocephalus in Siamese cats can be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait (Silson and Robinson 1969), but this has never been investigated adequately. The Chihuahua is the most commonly affected breed, which may also imply genetic factors to play a role in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus in this breed. It is, however, difficult to assess whether the higher prevalence of hydrocephalus in this breed is determined by a genetic anomaly affecting the central nervous system directly or rather associated with their aberrant head morphology (see achondroplasia). It is likely that analogous to internal hydrocephalus in people, a substantial number of currently unknown etiologies exist in dogs and cats which remain to be determined. The effect of prematurity on the central nervous system of companion animals has never been investigated. The well-documented association of hypoxia and/or intraventricular hemorrhage and the development of hydrocephalus in premature infants has not been demonstrated in dogs and cats yet. The close supervision of gestation and the neonatal period of dogs and cats is not equally established to document a pathophysiological link. However, the impact of prematurity and dystocia, which both are prevalent in small brachycephalic dogs, should be considered to be of similar importance for the development of hydrocephalus in animals.

Aqueductal stenosis is generally assumed to be a result of intrauterine virus infections. Experimental inoculations of parainfluenza and paramyxovirus have shown to be capable of inducing encephalitis in neonatal dogs (Baumg\u00e4rtner et al. 1982), and the development of aqueductal stenosis and internal hydrocephalus after reconvalescence has been described in puppies (Csiza 1971). The feline Parvovirus can produce similar changes in infected cat fetuses (Johnson and Johnson 1968). It is known from these inoculation studies that virus-mediated narrowing of the aqueduct occurs after ependymal cell destruction and subependymal reactive gliosis that produces a stenotic lesion later during the course of the disease. A number of canine viruses have a high affinity to ependymal and leptomeningeal cells, but virus protein or other evidence of viral infection has never been detected directly within the brain parenchyma of dogs with naturally occurring hydrocephalus. The experimental studies have shown, however, that aqueductal stenosis can develop without overt signs of inflammation in the periventricular parenchyma or viral persistence in ependymal cells (Baumg\u00e4rtner et al. 1982; Johnson and Johnson 1968).",

Indirect indication of a block of CSF flow at this site may be the dilation of the lateral ventricles and normal appearance of the third ventricle. On rare occasions, we were able to identify a thin septum bulging from the interventricular foramen toward the third ventricle on MR images (Fig. 2a). In vivo identification of such delicate structures via MRI certainly depends on image quality and may be detected with increasing frequency in the future owing to the growing number of high-field scanners used in the veterinary field.",

This in turn leads to direct transmission of arterial pressure waves onto the intraparenchymal vessels increasing the pulsation of the brain itself, which overloads the capacity of the CSF pathways (Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 and Klarica 2011). The findings of high CSF flow velocities in the mesencephalic aqueduct of dogs with ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus compared to normal controls support this theory.\n",

When they start to open their eyes at about 2 weeks of age, the optic system is still not fully developed. It takes around 2 weeks for their eyelids to open and to take on response to their environment. It will take several more weeks before their visual system matures and their eyesight begins to approach normal conditions. In this maturation period, they are hardly responsive in classical tests of visual function. Later in life, unusual behavior may lead to a suspicion that the vision is disturbed. In older puppies, owners realize that their animals show confusion in new or changed surroundings and are being easily startled. Cats often appear hesitant when walking or may bump into objects and misjudge heights. This may only be noticed when furniture and other objects are moved, because cats possess a tremendous ability to adapt to impaired vision. With increased intracranial pressure, there is always the potential for visual loss secondary to the papilledema. This is, however, rarely observed in dogs and cats with congenital hydrocephalus. The loss of visual pathways in the periventricular white matter and compression of the lateral geniculate body must be considered as the underlying cause for visual impairment, because the pretectal part of the visual system and visual cortex is usually preserved (W\u00fcnschmann and Oglesbee 2001). Clinical examination reveals poor attention to visual stimuli. It is usually tested using the menace response test that produces reflex blinking in response to the rapid approach of the examiner\u2019s hand toward the eye of the animal. Absent menace response with normal pupillary light reflexes is indicative for a lesion in the cortical part of the visual system. However, even in hydrocephalic animals with degeneration of almost the entire hemispheres and lack of any reaction to visual stimuli, blindness is often not complete. We have noticed a reaction when viewing moving objects compared to stationary objects. A lot of clinically blind animals show brisk response of changes in light. Although visual processing may occur on lower levels as the optic tectum, the reaction on subtle sounds or vibration can never be excluded. ",

However, unilaterally or bilaterally divergent strabismus (exotropia) occurs in a large number of brachycephalic breeds, which has been attributed to abnormal insertion of the medial rectus eye muscle. Care must be taken with some breed specialities. Siamese, Birman, and Himalayan cats frequently demonstrate congenital abnormalities of the visual pathways leading to strabismus (isotropic) and pendular nystagmus. Axonal projections from the temporal retina usually do not cross within the optic chiasm but for unknown reasons cross in these cats. This leads to conflicting visual information from both visual fields. The resulting convergent strabismus is interpreted as the result of a compensatory attempt to obtain a better overlap of the visual fields (Marzi 1980). ",

Most types of separation failure of the two hemispheres known in humans also occur in animals. Lobar holoprosencephaly with complete absence of midline separation, cyclopean, and a proboscis is mostly described in large animals, especially in herbivores grazed on early in gestation. The teratogenic alkaloids of this plant are capable to inhibit the sonic hedgehog (shh) signal transduction pathway regulating induction of dorsal and ventral prosencephalic separation (Cho et al. 1985; Schulze and Distl 2006; Welchl et al. 2009). Complete fusion of the cerebral hemispheres and a single dilated \u201clateral\u201d ventricle is accompanied by the absence of olfactory nerves, bulbs, and peduncles, which is why the malformation is often called arhinencephaly. This severe form has also been termed synophthalmia, focusing on the ocular and ignoring the underlying brain defects (Summers et al. 1995; Vandevelde et al. 2012; Williams 2010).",

Multiple defects in midline structures are associated with this phenotype, including the corpus callosum, interthalamic adhesion, septum pellucidum, and the hippocampal commissure and fornix as well as ventriculomegaly. Various degrees of abnormal gyral patterns with shallow sulcal depth can be found in mildly affected animals, whereas the more severely affected cats show an almost flat pallium.

            "text": "Two main types of cortical migration disorders exist in domestic animals, which are lissencephaly and polymicrogyria. With the exception of rabbits, rodents, and birds, all domestic animals have cortical convolutions. In ungulates, the adult neocortical pattern is fully developed at birth; in dogs and cats, the gyrification is completed 2 weeks postpartum (Schmidt et al. 2012a). Defects in neuronal migration leading to a marked reduction or absence of the convolutional pattern of the cerebral hemispheres have been diagnosed together with ventriculomegaly rather than with hydrocephalus. However, ventricular enlargement can be marked and easily mistaken for clinically relevant ventricular distension. Lissencephaly has been described only rarely. It can occur sporadically in animals due to nongenetic influences but is diagnosed in the Lhasa apso dog with a higher frequency (Greene et al. 1976; Saito et al. 2002; MacKillop 2011). It encompasses a spectrum from complete agyria (absent gyri) to regional pachygyria (Fraser et al. 2016). Lissencephaly can be part of complex brain malformations and may be accompanied by cerebellar hypoplasia or other structural defects (Summers et al. 1995). In cats, lissencephaly has been observed in the Korat cat breed with a higher frequency (Summers et al. 1995) and occasionally in the domestic shorthair cat. Attempts to explore the genetic background were not successful yet (Hermann et al. 2011). Affected pups can survive but tend have serious difficulties and may develop seizures, ataxia, tetraparesis, and serious behavioral issues as they get older. They also often have visual deficits and show aggressive behavior, all of which can be clinical signs of internal hydrocephalus.",

The obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow at the foramen magnum could be proven for the CKCS using phase-contrast cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Turbulent CSF flow patterns and increased CSF flow velocity were shown to be related to the presence and severity of syringomyelia. The pathogenesis of CM/SM in the dog has been under evaluation and discussion for decades. In the ongoing search for the underlying etiology of cerebellar herniation, two main hypotheses have been proposed (Driver et al. 2013). Next to a suspected enlargement of the cerebellum, the main hypothesis focuses on abnormal skull development. In analogy to human patients, hypoplasia of the basioccipital bone and a consecutive reduction in the volume of the caudal cranial fossa have been suggested. Volume overload of the caudal skull compartment and deviation of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum are assumed a consequence. However, independent studies were not able to demonstrate a difference in caudal cranial fossa volume in CKCS compared to other dog breeds (Cross et al. 2009; Schmidt et al. 2009). Hypoplasia of the occipital bone in relation to the whole skull volume could also not be confirmed (Schmidt et al. 2012b), but a reduced length and depth of the basioccipital bone were found in CKCSs with SM (Carrera et al. 2009). This is in conformity with the finding that the growth centers of the basicranium (spheno-occipital synchondrosis) undergo premature closure in CKCSs in comparison to mesocephalic and other brachycephalic dog breeds (Schmidt et al. 2013). Overall, not the volume of the skull compartments but the relative length of the cranial base seems to be the consistent finding in dogs and humans with SM. Laxity of the cranio-cervical junction with subluxation and \u201cbasal invagination\u201d has been proposed to contribute to the constriction of the spinal canal, with further compromise of the CSF flow.",

Although the feeding of whole carcasses to captive felids may be the natural strategy, it is usually not the most practical method of feeding in zoos and other research centers. This practice has resulted in nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamin A deficiency, even when vitamins are supplemented. Vitamin A plays an important role in cell division, cell differentiation, and the maintenance of differentiated cells in a number of tissues including the differentiation of osteoplastic cells. A severe impact on balanced bone growth associated with osseous hypertrophy in young growing felids has been observed (Fig. 8). The imbalanced growth mainly affects the cranial bones, especially the occipital bones and the osseous tentorium, which can result in severe constrictive compression of the cerebellum with consecutive herniation through the foramen magnum. The affected animals develop syringomyelia and non-communicating internal hydrocephalus. Clinical signs are characterized by medullary compression and upper motor neuron paresis of all four limbs with extensor spasticity of limb and neck muscles. Nystagmus may result from cerebellar compression. Obtundation occurs rather from medullary compression than from ventricular distension.",

The occipito-atlantoaxial overlapping syndrome describes the cranio-dorsal displacement of the atlas toward or through the foramen magnum and rostral invagination with cranial and dorsal displacement of the dens axis. The morphological changes in these dogs are similar to those found in the human disorder basilar invagination. Both conditions lead to dorsal elevation of the caudal aspect of the medulla oblongata and cranial aspect of the cervical spinal cord, as well as compression of the cerebellomedullary cistern, and variable indentation of the cerebellum (Cerda-Gonzalez et al. 2016; Loughin and Marino 2016). An abnormally short and flat dorsal arch of the atlas and a short cranial base have been identified as important structural differences between affected and unaffected dogs (Ondreka et al. 2015). Both changes allow for upward displacement of vertebral elements into the foramen magnum. This in turn leads to static or dynamic stenosis of the cerebellomedullary cistern with obstruction of CSF pathways and flow between the cranial cavity and spinal canal, which results in faulty craniospinal flow dynamics. Hydrocephalus and/or syringomyelia may also be seen because of direct mechanical blockage of normal CSF flow. Affected dogs can develop cervical pain and ataxia of variable degree. In some animals occipito-atlantoaxial overlapping is an incidental finding. ",

The ubiquitous virus replicates in enterocytes but this enteric infection is rarely fatal. The virus can pass the enteric border into the blood and is rapidly cleared in most instances. However, for not precisely determined reasons, some of these viruses mutate (Vennema et al. 1998). This mutation leads to the ability to invade and replicate in macrophages causing a violent multi-systemic inflammatory reaction. This reaction can have two forms, granulomatous or effusive. In granulomatous FIP there is no inflammatory exudation into the body cavities which is a classical clinical sign in the effusive form. The granulomatous form involves the central nervous system. The virus causes a cellular inflammatory reaction with inflammatory cells forming small granulomas around CNS arteries and venules. This periventricular vasculitis leads to exudation of a cell- and protein-rich fluid and periventricular reactive astrocytosis. Hydrocephalus , secondary to disease of the choroid and ependyma, has been well documented (Hayashi et al. 1980; Krum 1975; Foley et al. 1997).",

Most of these tumors exhibit slow growth and therefore may expand far beyond the sella without overt clinical signs (Fig. 13). Suprasellar macroadenomas are the most common sellar tumors in dogs and cats. Because pituitary imaging is not routinely performed in animals with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism, the true incidence may be higher than reported. In cats, pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism (PDH) is usually associated with diabetes mellitus, and the most frequent clinical signs are polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia rather than neurologic deficits. Acromegaly, due to growth hormone hypersecretion, is another possible clinical presentation of pituitary adenoma in cats. If the tumor starts compressing the thalamus, the most common neurologic sign is stupor. Dogs and cats may present behavioral abnormalities (disorientation, compulsive gait) and bilateral pretectal blindness suggesting compression and disruption of the optic chiasm and optic nerves. Due to the slow adenomatous growth, VP shunting is a reasonable therapeutic option to decrease intracranial pressure in affected animals.\n",

An open fontanel provides an acoustic window for ultrasound waves and allows visualization of the lateral and third ventricles even in skeletally mature patients. With gentle handling and bending of the head, the caudal (posterior) cranial fossa, brainstem, and cerebellum can be examined through the foramen magnum. In our experience congenital hydrocephalus has already caused severe reduction of the cerebral parenchyma at the time of the diagnosis. Ventriculomegaly is not found in normal puppies. Hence, ultrasonography can be used as an easy screening test to confirm or rule out hydrocephalus in neonatal puppies.

The identification of clinically relevant ventricular distension is extremely substantial for the correct causal indication of CSF shunting. We have seen a number of dogs with neurological signs, which had been referred to our hospital for ventriculoperitoneal shunting, in which a diagnosis of internal hydrocephalus was made based on the finding of ventricular enlargement alone. CSF examination, however, often revealed idiopathic encephalitis, which primarily requires medical treatment. Inflammatory brain disease may easily be overlooked, and large ventricles can easily be misinterpreted as the underlying cause for present neurological signs in those dogs. Detailed morphological abnormalities indicative of increased IVP beyond ventricular dilation can be identified by means of MRI, which help to distinguish between the two entities. We were able to identify morphological differences between hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly, which are useful in the differentiation of these two entities (Troxel et al. 2003). In high intraventricular pressure, the lateral ventricles often extend into the olfactory peduncles and bulbs, which is not a normal finding in carnivores. Care must be taken in ungulates, where the olfactory recess is physiologically widely open. Periventricular edema is the most useful indicator of overpressure but is unfortunately not present in all patients with clinical manifestation of internal hydrocephalus.",

It is still proposed as a reasonable treatment option in a number of textbooks. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide is traditionally recommended as medical treatment option as well (Thomas 2010; Estey 2015; Harrington et al. 1996). These treatment strategies need to be reconsidered. Recently, it has been found that the ventricular volume and the clinical signs of dogs with internal hydrocephalus were not changed sufficiently using acetazolamide 10 mg/kg TID (Kolecka et al. 2015). Similarly, in a long-term study in dogs, the H+-K+ inhibitor omeprazole (10 mg/kg SID) was also not able to significantly decrease CSF production in dogs (Girod et al. 2016). This is in contrast to former experimental studies, which have shown that these agents can reduce CSF production significantly. However, their efficacy was never evaluated over a longer study period. Adaptive processes such as increased production of osmogenic ions from the ependyma and choroid plexus or the upregulation of an acetazolamide-resistant isozyme might be an explanation for the lack of treatment success. Reduction of CSF production and intraventricular pressure has been demonstrated after administration of all of the aforementioned drugs as a short-term effect. The use for temporary palliation of clinical signs (12\u201348 h) might therefore be reasonable.",

Early complications are usually seen within weeks after the surgical intervention. Despite the use of valve systems, the most refractory problem of CSF shunt diversion has been overdrainage whose consequences occur usually 3\u20134 days after implantation, especially in congenital hydrocephalus. This can result in the devastating complication of subdural hematoma requiring rapid intervention or complete collapse of the hemispheres, which results in euthanasia (Fig. 14). An important intermediate postoperative complication is obstruction of the intraventricular catheter. Clinical evaluation of animals is not helpful because they do not clearly show signs of headaches or visual impairment. Changes of their clinical status appear rather instantaneously. We try to control proper shunt function to the greatest possible extent by daily CSF examinations at inpatient care by tapping of subcutaneous flushing reservoirs. Until now we could not identify a threshold level, but continuous increase of CSF protein within the 1st week after surgery is a significant indicator in expecting shunt obstruction. At recheck after 3 months, CSF can often not be sampled from the shunt system. This may be found in animals with shunt obstruction but also in animals with complete restoration of the cerebral parenchyma that now completely surrounds the ventricular catheter. Recheck MRI is therefore mandatory to determine the underlying cause and appropriate therapeutic approach. Economic constraints often limit surgical revision.",

Pathological examinations of Dexler (1899) and later of Fankhauser (Frauchiger and Frankhauser 1957) identified a chronic swelling and edema in the brain in affected horses. They described that this swelling leads to an increase of brain volume, which in turn causes a subtentorial herniation of the occipital lobe and thus a compression of the mesencephalic aqueduct (Fig. 16a). The large ossified tentorium in horses has been suggested to be a predisposing factor for the herniation (Dexler 1899).

            "text": " Some small toy-breed dogs (miniature pinscher, toy poodle, English toy terrier) appear to be miniaturized but proportioned versions of larger breeds. Modification of the IGF1 gene is a major determinant of small size in dogs (Isgaard et al. 1988). However, the skeletal characteristics of brachycephalic dogs cannot be totally explained by IGF1 deficits. Control of postnatal general skeletal and craniofacial growth involves complex interactions of genes, nutrients, and hormones; one of those is the pituitary growth hormone \u2013 GH (Wilson and Foster 1992; Rubenstein and Federman 1989). In the appendicular skeleton, the growth hormone (GH) among others regulates the proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes, via stimulation of local mediators such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) (Isaaksson Isaksson et al. 1991). It is known that growth hormone increases cartilage formation by acting both directly and indirectly on chondrocytes in the appendicular skeleton and the cranial base synchondroses (Konfino et al. 1975). The lack of growth hormone also results in well-proportioned miniature dogs (ateliotic dwarfism). Most of the toy breeds are ateliotic dwarfs: Chihuahuas, Boston terriers, Italian greyhounds, Maltese, miniature pinschers, miniature spaniels, Pomeranians, toy poodles, Yorkshire terriers, etc. (Stockard 1941). The external morphology of the dog head was categorized into three types: animals with long slender skulls and prominent noses, a large external sagittal crest, and a narrow zygomatic arch were characterized as dolichocephalic (e.g., borzoi dog), while dogs with a round head without a sagittal crest and with a braincase longer than the facial bones were classified as brachycephalic (Pug dog, French bulldog, Pekingese, etc.) and the intermediate type is called mesocephalic (German shepherd dog, Labrador retriever, etc.). Although we have accepted the brachycephalic phenotypes as a breed characteristic, we have to consider that some of these features are representations of a pathologic skeletal development. These breeds show chondrodystrophic changes in their skeletal growth. Radiographic studies have shown that the spheno-occipital synchondrosis undergoes a premature closure in brachycephalic dogs (Schmidt et al. 2008). The resulting shortening of the cranial base determines the restricted growth of the braincase and the facial bones in these animals. One effect of restricted longitudinal growth is a compensatory widening of the skull as a whole and of the skull base, which influences the volume of skull base foramina. A stenosis of the jugular foramen has been found in the brachycephalic Cavalier King Charles spaniels. This stenosis and a consecutive vascular compromise in the foramen may contribute to venous hypertension and increased intraventricular and intracranial pressure.",
