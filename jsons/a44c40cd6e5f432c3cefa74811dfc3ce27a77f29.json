Currently, limited immunomodulator is available to counteract IAV-associated pneumonia in the clinic. Sinensetin, a polymethoxylated flavone with five methoxy groups, has been found to possess anti-agiogenesis, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. However, the effects of sinensetin on IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response remain unclear. In the present study, the antiinflammatory effects and corresponding possible mechanism of sinensetin in IAV-infected A549 cells were subjected to investigations.",

The antiviral activity of sinensetin against influenza A virus was assayed in A549 cells with an engineered replication-competent influenza A virus carrying Gaussia luciferase reporter gene infection. The effect of sinensetin on influenza A virustriggered inflammatory reaction was determined by qRT-PCR, Luminex assays, ELISA and Western blot. Results: Our results showed that sinensetin did not exhibit antiviral activity against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Meanwhile, sinensetin treatment significantly decreased IAV-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators at mRNA and protein levels, including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IP-10, IL-8 and MCP-1. Additionally, levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the downstream product prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) up-regulated by IAV infection were dramatically suppressed by sinensetin. The mechanistic investigation revealed that sinensetin treatment suppressed the NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity using the NF-\u03baB reporter stable HEK293 cell line stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/mL) or influenza H1N1 virus. Furthermore, sinensetin abrogated influenza H1N1 virus-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings.",

It has been suggested that elevation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in local or systemic accounted for the symptom formation in human with seasonal influenza virus infection [10] [11] [12] . Uncontrolled cytokine production (termed \"cytokine storm\") in fatal cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 or H7N9 avian influenza virus infection has been found to be as the most common findings [13, 14] . The efficacy of corticosteroids treatment for influenza patients with pneumonia remained controversial. For example, in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia, early combination oseltamivir and corticosteroids treatment seemed to confer a therapeutic benefit [15] . Conversely, retrospective studies revealed that corticosteroids treatment contributed to delay viral clearance and increase mortality in patients with H3N2 or 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection [16, 17] . Therefore, corticosteroids were not recommended as routine drugs to treatment of patients with severe influenza pneumonia [18] . Based on these facts, development of novel immunomodulator or therapeutic approach for treatment of influenza pneumonia is an urgent clinical need.",

It's well-recognized that the interaction between virus-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and cellular specialized pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) leads to IKB\u03b1/NF-\u03baB dissociation and thus released NF-\u03baB translocates into nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 [19] . Recent studies in vitro and in vivo revealed that massive induction of proinflammatory mediators in H5N1-infected patients was NF-\u03baB-dependent [20, 21] . Furthermore, involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs in the low or high pathogenic influenza-mediated dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression has been reported [22, 23] . Therefore, these observations indicated that pharmacological inhibition of certain host cellular signaling associated with regulation of cytokine expression may act as a promising therapeutic strategy for the aberrant immune response induced by IAV.",

Consistent with these results, influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) -induced elevated secretion of IL-6, IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and MCP-1 in the culture supernatant was reversed by sinensetin treatment (Fig. 2c) .

Firstly, the NF-\u03baB reporter plasmid experiments showed that sinensetin treatment inhibited TNF-\u03b1 or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) -stimulated activation of NF-\u03baB (Fig. 4a, b) . In accordance to that, immunoblot results confirmed that activation of NF-\u03baB triggered by viral infection was inhibited by sinensetin treatment (Fig. 4c) . Similarly, sinensetin treatment significantly decreased the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signalings, but not AKT signaling.

Accumulating evidence suggested that the severe IAV infection, for the most part, could be provoked or exacerbated by the extent of inflammation in the respiratory system [8] . Interestingly, delayed concomitant treatment of neuraminidase inhibitor and immunomodulator resulted in a therapeutic benefit effect in mice infected lethal H5N1 influenza virus [43] , which highlighted that the development of effective immunomodulatory agents is essential to attenuate the severity of the viral infection.",

But the effects of sinensetin on IAV-induced inflammation has not been reported. Our study demonstrated that sinensetin treatment significantly decreased IAV-triggered up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, MCP-1, COX-2 and PGE 2 . Excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators was considered as a hallmark of serious viral infectious diseases [44] . Increased IL-6 expression in patient with seasonal or pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection has been shown to be implicated in clinical symptom formation and illness severity [45] . Although TNF-\u03b1 was documented for its role in antiviral immunity, it has pleiotropic properties that include stimulating other inflammatory mediator expression as well as disturbing the epithelial tight junction barrier, thus promoting development of ARDS [46] [47] [48] . In mice, studies demonstrated that deficiency in TNF-\u03b1 signaling significantly improved highly virulent H5N1 virus-mediated excessive inflammation and high mortality [49] . Higher levels of chemokines, including IP-10, IL-8 and MCP-1, were believed to be associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) progression and even fatal outcome in patients with H5N1 or H7N9 virus infection [14, 50] . Blockade of IP-10 and MCP-1 was proved to significantly lessen the disease severity of influenza virus infection [51, 52] . Expression of COX-2 and PGE 2 has been suggested to play a role in enhancing virus-induced inflammation and impairment of host antiviral immunity [39, 53] . Based on the above evidences, the inhibitory effect on these IAV-induced inflammatory mediators exerted by sinensetin might act as a promising strategy for treatment of influenza infectious diseases with excessive inflammation.",

            "text": "Host intracellular signaling activated by viral infection, such as NF-\u03baB and MAPKs pathways, has been reported to be involved in the aberrant pro-inflammatory response associated with poor clinical outcome [23, 54] . It has been shown that the induction of immune response-related genes in the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infection was almost NF-\u03baB-dependent [20] . It is believed that aberrant p38 MAPK activation is a critical driver for increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine in patients with severe influenza [49] . Moreover, NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK signaling are involved in initiating expression of lipid mediators COX-2 and PGE 2 [55, 56] . Therefore, (30, 60 , 120 \u03bcg/mL) treatment for 24 h. a-b COX-2 levels were detected by qRT-PCR (a) and immunoblot analysis (b), respectively. c COX-2 expression was quantified using the imageJ software. d PGE 2 production in the culture supernatants was measured by ELISA. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 compared to influenza virus-infected alone targeting of these signalings may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for attenuating dysregulated inflammation in patients with severe influenza. Pharmacologic inhibition of NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK decreased an array of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, COX-2 and PGE 2 , and thus improved the outcome of influenza diseases [23, [57] [58] [59] [60] . Our results showed that the polymethoxylated flavone sinensetin decreased IAV-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings. Therefore, it can be speculated that sinensetin exerted anti-inflammatory effect on IAV-mediated inflammation that may be due to its inhibitory action on these intracellular signaling cascades.",
