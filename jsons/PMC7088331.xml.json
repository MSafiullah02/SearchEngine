Despite the important developments at the medical sciences influenza pandemics are still keeping up to date due to the nature of the influenza virus. Influenza viruses are the members of the Orthomyxoviridae family and include three types of viruses (A, B and C). Influenza C viruses have some structural differences from influenza A and B viruses, and do not cause severe epidemic disease. Both influenza A and B may cause severe epidemic disease in humans, only influenza A virus can cause pandemic influenza [1].",

An outbreak of avian influenza ,which caused by the H5N1 strain of the influenza A virus, in Asia, Africa and Europe has resulted in the deaths of over 200 million birds in recent years [6]. The H5N1 virus doesn\u2019t have ability to transmit efficiently from human to human yet, but many health authorities across the world agree that H5N1 or another lethal virus will cause a catastrophic influenza pandemic in the near future [7, 8]. Due to the potential magnitude of this disaster, World Health Organization (WHO) traces the virus from 110 national laboratories in 52 countries with the responsibilities of the original World Influenza Centre shared by four Collaborating Centers, located in Atlanta, London, Tokyo and Melbourne [1]. In addition to fatal impact, pandemic influenza also has socio-economic impact, sourcing from direct healthcare costs and indirect costs. Direct healthcare costs include vaccination cost, antiviral treatment cost and hospitalization cost. Due to the characteristic symptoms of pandemic influenza, patients may need several days of bed rest at home or may require intensive care unit (ICU) care and non-ICU care at hospitals. Pandemic influenza also affects the services and economy, through illness, absenteeism, and lost production. All these factors constitute the indirect cost of pandemic influenza.",

The literature on pandemic influenza\u2019s economic impact is made in different countries by the several researchers. Meltzer, I. et al. [2, 3] modeled the economic impact of pandemic influenza in the United States and tried to find implications for setting priorities for intervention. Bloom and Wit made brief looks to the possible economic consequences for Asia of a mutation of avian flu leading to human-to-human transmission, using different assumptions about the duration and virulence of the flu pandemic. They claimed that a pandemic will likely slow or halt economic growth in Asia and lead to a significant reduction in trade, particularly in services. In the long run potential economic growth will be lower and poverty will increase [9]. Akazawa et al. investigated the economic costs of influenza-related work absenteeism. They assumed the average number of workdays missed due to influenza like illness (ILI) 1.30 days, and the average work loss value US$137 per person. They provided a simple framework within which competing considerations of disease epidemiology, worker productivity, and economic costs [10]. Postma et al. reviewed some selected studies which were related influenza vaccination in combination with cost, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, efficiency, economic evaluation, health-policy, and pharmacoeconomics according to several criteria such as i. benefit-to-cost (B/C) ratio; ii. vaccine effectiveness; iii. relative cost of vaccine [11]. Ryan et al. aimed to establish the number of people who may be eligible for influenza vaccination in the European Union (EU), and estimated the costs and consequences of not vaccinating this population for five EU member states, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK [5].",

After the first wave, vaccines can be developed and can be used to mitigate the impact of pandemic influenza. The calculations in this study are based on this assumption. We assume that vaccine exists and the effect of the vaccine is known and given. We distribute the vaccines to the population according to different strategies based on the given rate of population to be vaccinated, such as 20%, 40%, 60,... etc.,.

The health impact and economic impact can be inversely proportional for pandemic diseases. In this study, we estimate the economic impact of the pandemic influenza according to different scenarios and different attack rates. Our optimistic calculations show that the economic impact will be between 1.364 billion dollars and 2.687 billions dollars to Turkish economy. The speculative items are not included in the calculations such as increasing vaccine and antiviral drugs. If we add the speculative items, the cost will absolutely be more severe to the economy.",
