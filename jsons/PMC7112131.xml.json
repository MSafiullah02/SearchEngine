            "text": "Enteric viruses have frequently been implicated in recreational water-related gastro-intestinal (G.I.) disease (Sinclair et al., 2009). Studies in Europe and the US suggest that most infections contracted as a result of swimming, canoeing or other recreational use of sewage-polluted water may be viral in nature (e.g. Medema et al., 1995, Gray et al., 1997). Enteric viruses may cause asymptomatic or mild infections in humans, but these faecal-orally transmitted viruses may also cause more serious disease, such as hepatitis and meningitis, especially in vulnerable groups, e.g. young children (Nwachuku and Gerba, 2006). Enteric viruses are recognized as agents that can cause large outbreaks throughout the world with thousands of cases (Sarguna et al., 2007, Bucardo et al., 2007, Iijima et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2009). Novel emerging viruses such as SARS coronavirus, human parechovirus and zoonotic influenza viruses also appear to be excreted in faeces but the evidence for enteric transmission is not always clear (Ding et al., 2004). Transmission routes for enteric viruses may be diverse such as person\u2013person, food- or waterborne associated with insufficient hygiene and sanitation (Koopmans et al., 2002, Wyn-Jones and Sellwood, 2001). Disease outbreaks associated with enteric viruses, such as noroviruses and astroviruses, in bathing water have been described (Hauri et al., 2005, Maunula et al., 2004). However, bathing water-related outbreaks may be easily missed due to either unidentified source or unidentified agent, or both.",

            "text": "Enteric viruses in water may originate from discharges of raw or treated sewage, run-off of animal manure or directly from humans or animals. Viruses commonly associated with waterborne disease include the human adenoviruses (HAdVs), noroviruses (NoVs), hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV, HEV), parvoviruses, enteroviruses, and rotaviruses (RVs). In addition, sewage, especially from slaughterhouses, may contain (for example) animal adenoviruses, sapoviruses, and HEV (Hundesa et al., 2006), which may be zoonotic. Viruses originating from (un)treated sewage can contaminate bathing water after discharge into surface waters (in)directly used for recreational water activities. All are capable of infection by ingestion. Some multiply in the intestine and may cause diarrhoea and/or vomiting, while some are associated with tissues (e.g. the liver) other than the gut. The viruses responsible for waterborne infections are not usually identified at the time of a disease outbreak following recreational water activity, and robust associations between the simultaneous presence of virus in faeces of affected individuals and in the water are only occasionally demonstrated (e.g. Hoebe et al., 2004). The epidemiological picture of disease associated with recreational use of water is therefore far from complete, and measures to limit enteric disease after exposure to recreational water are based on water quality parameters built on the detection of faecal bacterial indicator organisms (FIOs). However, it has been shown that water conforming to bacterial standards may contain high levels of human enteric viruses and that FIOs often fail to predict the risk for waterborne pathogens including enteric viruses (Gerba et al., 1979, Lipp et al., 2001). Further, several studies have shown that levels of indicator bacteria do not correlate with those of viruses, particularly when faecal indicator concentrations are low (Contreras-Coll et al., 2002). Viruses are known to be more resistant to environmental degradation than bacteria (Vasl et al., 1981, Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003, Rzezutka and Cook, 2004, de Roda Husman et al., 2009). Together with the understanding that G.I. illness may be due to viruses rather than bacteria, this provides a case for using a viral indicator of human faecal pollution rather than to rely exclusively on bacterial parameters.",

The pathogenesis of enterovirus infections is now better understood, and this belief is considered unsound in determining water quality. Further, although important pathogens in many contexts, the presence of enteroviruses in water does not necessarily correlate with the presence of pathogens such as hepatitis A virus (Dubrou et al., 1991, Pina et al., 1998). The enterovirus parameter was removed during the revision of the 1976 Directive.",

Although mainly described as end-point assays, amplification products of both techniques can be detected by real-time methods.

            "text": "A viral indicator may be better suited to indicate the risk of human pathogenic viruses in bathing waters. However, cell culture-based methods for viral detection are costly, require specialised skills and equipment, and have too long a turnaround time. For this reason, the EU Framework 6 Project VIROBATHE was done to devise a robust, rapid and cost-efficient method for routine compliance monitoring of enteric viruses in recreational waters. Part of the work involved Europe-wide surveillance of recreational waters to determine the frequency of target virus occurrence and, to a limited extent, serotypes and quantities. So that the virus levels could be seen in the context of compliance-related water quality, the work also included determination of FIO levels to provide general water quality data. The viruses selected as targets were adenoviruses and noroviruses. The former are shed by many individuals (often without showing symptoms), they are more environmentally robust than enteroviruses (Enriquez et al., 1995, Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003), they have been found in surveys of polluted waters (e.g. Pina et al., 1998, Laverick et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2004, Miagostovich et al., 2008), and have been associated with outbreaks of disease in swimming pools (e.g. Papapetropolou and Vantarakis, 1995, Harley et al., 2001) and other recreational waters (Sinclair et al., 2009). Being DNA viruses, their detection by PCR does not have the problems associated with the genetic variation seen with RNA viruses. They are also more likely to be detected in recreational water samples (e.g. Pina et al., 1998, Miagostovich et al., 2008), especially if sensitive nucleic acid detection methods are used, and they may therefore provide the best indicator of viral faecal pollution. Noroviruses are the most important cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in people of all age groups and many waterborne outbreaks have been reported. Sinclair et al. (2009) reviewed 55 recreational water-related G.I. disease outbreaks of which 25 (46%) were reported as caused by noroviruses.",

A minimum of 80 10-L water samples from the main site was taken and up to 20 additional samples were taken in the event of (e.g.) heavy rain or when investigators considered that there was some other occurrence which may have resulted in deterioration of water quality. The second site could also be used if the main site yielded negative data in the first stages of sampling, or for taking the 20 additional samples following the 80 minimum to be taken at the main site. Thus, each laboratory could focus on one site (100 samples) or divide surveillance between the main site (80 samples) and the second site (20 samples). In practice both approaches were used, so in total, 24 sites were sampled. Sites were sampled at approximately weekly intervals from the end of May to the beginning of November 2006, which included the Bathing Season in all Member States. On each sampling occasion, four 10-L samples (a \u2018tetrad\u2019), plus one additional sample for positive Quality Control (QC) purposes, were collected from each site.

Further, in marine waters the detection rate of norovirus GI was almost as high as norovirus GII (7.9% compared with 8.5%), which differs from the clinical context where GI viruses are found much less frequently than GII types in patients from gastroenteritis outbreaks, even in surveys of unaffected individuals (e.g. Verhoef et al., 2009). However, these high GI detection rates were mainly due to just four sites having higher frequencies of NoV GI.",

Among the marine sites, 55% of samples from Pomezia, Rome, were positive for HAdV, while none was found at one of the Barcelona sites (though more samples were positive at the second site), and none was detected at Larnaca, Cyprus, where it is known no sewage is discharged. Among the freshwater sites, no HAdV was found at Kirchentellinsfurt Lake in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, while 80% of samples were HAdV-positive at Amper Grasslfing in Bavaria and 91% were positive at the site at Tomblaine, Nancy, a site well recognised for its anthropogenic effects as well as its recreational activities (mainly canoeing). With respect to noroviruses, five out of 11 marine water sites, and four out of 13 freshwater sites gave samples positive for GI noroviruses, the highest recovery from a marine site being 30% of samples positive at Pomezia (Rome), and that from a freshwater site being 10% of samples positive at Reading. Genogroup II noroviruses were detected at eight marine and eight freshwater sites, the highest frequencies being 16.3% positive samples at Ardea (Rome, marine), and 15% at Durgerdam (freshwater).

The frequent detection of HAdVs by most laboratories reflected their known environmental robustness; though it was not possible to perform ICC-PCR on all the adenovirus-positive samples and thus show that all contained infectious viruses, it is known that adenoviruses can persist in an infectious state in various environments over long periods (Rzezutka and Cook, 2004).

In this study, the high frequency of NoV GI detection in two Laboratories suggests a higher level in the environment than was demonstrated by consideration of the rest of the data for this virus. Detection of GI noroviruses in the environment is not matched by their detection in clinical samples; GI NoV strains have been detected frequently in sewage, effluent, and surface waters (da Silva et al., 2007, Katayama et al., 2008, Myrmel et al., 2006), which contributes to the view that many norovirus infections are symptomless, with GI viruses being under-represented among those found in clinical cases. It is unclear whether this relates to our data as most of the GI isolates were found in only four sites. The frequency of GII norovirus detection (approximately 6%) was as expected. It is commonly accepted that norovirus-related disease shows a seasonal trend, with most outbreaks and sporadic cases occurring in winter. Whilst it would have been interesting to obtain a temporal distribution of environmental norovirus detection similar to that of Nordgren et al. (2009), this was not feasible in this study since it was specifically planned to be related to the EU bathing season, and in any case RT-PCR detection might not have provided resolution high enough to show temporal differences in norovirus levels.

Recovery values of 49% (seeded fresh water) and 37% (seeded artificial sea water) were considered acceptable, though variations between laboratories prevented direct statistical comparisons of performance, and a modified method for marine water samples was developed during the project (Calgua et al., 2008). The percentage of correctly identified positive samples was around 90%, except for HAdV in freshwater, which showed a sensitivity of 77%, while the specificity of the methods was shown to be 93% or more. The sensitivity and specificity values compare well with those of some PCR-based methods for foodborne pathogen detection (Abdulmawjood et al., 2004, Malorny et al., 2004). The lower sensitivity value of the adenovirus/freshwater may be due to the fact that the HAdV concentration in the seeded sample was lower than the NoV concentration used. This may also explain the higher COR values for the HAdV-positive marine and freshwater samples. Furthermore, it should be noted that the samples used for the QC were not actually identical, whereas for the COR estimation this would be preferred. Each participant used the water from their own site(s), and this would differ from site to site and from week to week. River water, particularly, will contain varying levels of material that may reduce the effectiveness of the concentration method and/or inhibit the molecular assays. Notwithstanding this, the results demonstrate that the methods used are robust, although currently no criteria exist on lower limits of acceptability for robustness of methods for detection of viruses in water.",

If an (RT)PCR signal was obtained from an undiluted nucleic acid extract, and the assumption is made that the assay could detect one target molecule, this signifies that there was one virus equivalent in 10 \u03bcL nucleic acid extract. There were thus 10 virus equivalents in 100 \u03bcL nucleic acid extract, and on the assumption that this extract was obtained from 5 mL concentrate with no loss of target nucleic acid, this implies that there were 20 virus particles in the 10 mL concentrate. Assuming that the concentrate was derived from the original sample with no loss of virus, the conclusion is that a signal from the neat extract indicates that there were at least 20 virus particles in the 10-L water sample. If the extract had to be diluted to 10\u22121, then there were 200 virus particles in the 10-L sample.",

Concentration by glass wool filtration is inexpensive requiring no specialised equipment beyond a centrifuge capable of 7000\u00d7 g, and running costs are minimal. Membrane filtration is slightly more expensive, requiring a filtration stand, but again, running costs are low. Both approaches contrast with (for example) ultrafiltration (high costs of filtration units and pumps, or disposable cartridges) and ultracentrifugation, which is unlikely to be found in routine environmental virology laboratories. The time taken to process samples was also an important factor; using the selected methods it was possible to process up to eight samples in one day (including controls) following familiarisation with the method. For detection, cell culture was not considered for the surveillance stage, being too slow, expensive and requiring specialised facilities; the costs and labour time spent on molecular detection was as might be expected in any laboratory equipped for PCR and related techniques.",

Reaction inhibition by substances in the sample is a well-known problem associated with analysis of environmental samples (e.g. da Silva et al., 2007), and was observed in this study. The use of the IACs in both NoV and HAdV PCRs was of significant benefit in guarding against false negative reactions. In the current study the norovirus RT-PCR suffered about 5.5% of reactions failing to give a conclusive result (4.4% of freshwater samples and 7.7% of marine samples). Samples were tested at a higher dilution (up to 10\u22123) to remove inhibition and achieve a positive IAC signal. Successive dilutions were done when a higher concentration failed to give a target signal or an IAC signal. Inhibition of the adenovirus PCR was much less problematic, with PCR reactions of 0.9% of freshwater samples and 5.6% of marine water samples being inhibited. Samples from one inland major river site (Kew Bridge, UK) had often to be diluted up to 10\u22123 and consequently unexpectedly low numbers of samples positive for adenovirus (23%) were recorded. Subsequent tests with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the PCR reaction suggest that routine incorporation of this reagent in the reaction mix may reduce enzymatic inhibition.",

The enteric Ad40 and Ad41 viruses cannot be grown in most cell culture systems that support the growth of adenoviruses from the other subgroups, A549, HeLa, primary human amnion and primary human embryo kidney cells (Tiemessen and Kidd, 1995). They have been shown to replicate in cell culture systems using Graham 293 cells, HEp-2 cells and HT-29 cells (Ko et al., 2003, Tiemessen and Kidd, 1995). Our data support these findings, because the presence of both Ad40 and Ad41 was shown by direct PCR, not in the cell culture-PCR assay using A549 cells. Direct inoculation of cell cultures followed by observation over an extended period would not provide a good indication of infectivity and would not be in the interests of providing a rapid test. The finding that about 20% of freshwater samples and about 47% of marine water samples contained infectious adenovirus supports laboratory observations (e.g. Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003) that these agents are environmentally robust.",

However, use of an adenovirus PCR, for example, as a means of determining recreational water quality would require the use of quantitative, rather than presence/absence detection. Quantitative PCRs for different types of environmental adenovirus are now available. Whether such a test would detect infectious virus may be addressed by, for example, detection of virus-specific mRNA, and also there is some evidence that in adenovirus preparations from which free DNA has been removed before analysis virus titres measured by infectivity and by QPCR are very similar (Giron\u00e8s, personal communication). It would then be necessary to determine any association between adenovirus levels and health risk, and there is thus a need for further work before the viral parameters investigated here could be used in a regulatory framework prior to epidemiological investigation to provide an appropriate evidence-base for policy development.",
