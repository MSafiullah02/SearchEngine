The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use recently proposed a structured approach to improve antibiotic decision making by clinicians, which emphasizes the 4 critical time points in antibiotic prescribing [2, 3]. The first time point of this organized approach requires the physician to ask: \u201cDoes this patient have an infection that requires antibiotics?\u201d. This question aims to remind the clinician to synthesize all relevant patient information to determine the likelihood of an infection that requires antibiotic therapy. The questionable ability of physicians to answer this first question properly in the context of pneumonia was the impetus for this study.",

            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major global healthcare burden associated with significant morbidity, mortality and costs [4\u20139]. Identifying the etiology of CAP is an utmost priority for its management and treatment decisions [10]. Although the range of pathogens that may be involved in these cases is broad, physicians must at least determine whether a bacterial or a viral pathogen (or both) is causing the pneumonia to determine if antibiotic treatment is appropriate. Whether the etiology of CAP is viral or bacterial should be determined based on the patient interview, clinical symptoms and signs, biological findings and radiological data from the very first hours of the patient\u2019s presentation (a time when microbiological findings are typically not yet available). Physicians must use the knowledge obtained from their routine practice and medical education to make sense of these diverse data input streams, triage the resulting complex dataset, and make appropriate decisions. A growing body of research has recently suggested that difficulties in accessing, organizing, and using a substantial amount of data could be significantly ameliorated by use of emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-derived methods, which are nowadays applied in diverse fields including biology, computer science and sociology [11]. AI excels at finding complex relationships in large volumes of data and can rapidly analyze many variables to predict outcomes of interest. In the context of CAP in intensive care units (ICUs), where information are particularly diverse, we wondered if an AI data-driven approach to reducing the medical complexity of a patient could allow us to make a better hypothesis regarding the microbial etiology at the patient\u2019s presentation.",

This method was employed to optimize the ability of the algorithm to distinguish viral and bacterial pneumonia based on the combination of parameters available in the work dataset. All available data were thus included in the model, regardless of the data type. Qualitative data were processed as binary information (i.e. influenza immunization: present \u201c1\u201d, absent \u201c0\u201d). Raw data were provided for quantitative values (no cut-offs defined). We built the predictive mathematical model from the work dataset using the Random Forest method and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. We started by determining the most relevant item to use through a variable selection procedure using the Random Forest method and the Mean Decrease in Gini criterion (value 0.75). Then, the population in the work dataset was randomly separated into two independent datasets: 80% of cases were assigned to the training set and 20% were assigned to the test set. N models with bootstrap resampling (with N = 25) were performed on the training set and validated on the test set. The model providing the best prediction criteria was selected, and the final model was built from the entire work dataset. Finally, an independent validation set of samples was used to test the pathogen prediction performance of the AI algorithm. To decipher the relative importance of clinical versus biological/radiological variables in the predictions, we generated three algorithms built from different parameters of the work dataset: (i) clinical variables only, (ii) biological and radiological variables only, and (iii) all variables. For each parameter tested, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated, and the best cutoff value that yielded the highest accuracy was determined along with the sensitivity and specificity.",

We demonstrated that experienced clinicians synthesizing all this information failed to adequately answer the question: \u201cis it a viral or a bacterial pneumonia?\u201d, as the discriminant ability between the two diagnoses was considered low. We interpreted our results mainly based on the calculation of likelihood ratios, as recommended for reports of a diagnostic test for an infectious disease [12]. Likelihood ratios incorporate both sensitivity and specificity and, unlike predictive values, do not vary with prevalence, making them good statistical tools to facilitate translation of knowledge from research to clinical practice [12]. In parallel, we designed a data-driven approach. Different AI methods were available; we selected the Random Forest method because it is one of the most efficient strategies for providing a predictive algorithm in this context [18\u201321]. Importantly, the final algorithm was tasked with providing predictions for a novel population independent of the dataset used for the algorithm construction. The discriminant abilities of the AI approach restricted to the binary choice \u201cviral\u201d or \u201cbacterial\u201d were superior to those of experts but still considered low or moderate and were ultimately insufficient to provide an indisputable therapeutic decision. It is important to emphasize that we chose a high cutoff value for determining the discriminant ability of the AI approach (LR+ > 10, LR- < 0.1); this choice was made for two reasons. First, in this proof-of-concept study, we did not analyze co-infections and restricted the possible choices to a binary prediction. Because we reduced the complexity of the cases, we expected high predictive performances. Second, the goal of this study was not a prediction of outcomes (e.g., ICU length of stay, mortality), which are informative but do not determine patient management; it was to provide a clear and immediate medical decision: whether or not to prescribe antibiotics. The immediate clinical consequences in this situation demand a high predictive performance. Still, it is important to highlight that the machine learning method we developed achieved an AUC of 0.84, which is superior or at least equal to AUC values usually observed for predictive mathematical models developed for the ICU environment. For instance, the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) have AUC values of 0.61, 0.70 and 0.73, respectively, for identifying sepsis [22]. An AI Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis has been engineered and achieved AUC values ranging from 0.83\u20130.85 according to the time of the prediction. An AI method for predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation achieved an AUC of 0.82 [23].",

First, having data of excellent quality is critical for the success of AI predictions. The ICU environment is data-rich, providing fertile soil for the development of accurate predictive models [24], but it is also a challenging environment with heterogeneous and complex data. In our study, the data that fueled the AI method were from a real-world data source. It is probably more difficult to create a consistent data format when merging data from interviews, patient examinations, biological and radiological information than when using datasets from the insurance or finance industries. Additionally, data arising from patient examinations and interviews are still strictly dependent on the physician\u2019s skill and experience. Finally, although we hypothesized that the AI capabilities would exceed human skills and make accurate predictions when physicians cannot, we must also consider the null hypothesis: viral and bacterial pneumonias share the same characteristics and cannot be distinguished based on initial clinical, biological or radiological parameters. The dividing lines between the signs and symptoms of a viral versus a bacterial infection could be too blurry to permit the two diagnoses to be discerned without microbial analyses.",

Utilizing rapid molecular respiratory panel assays may increase the likelihood of optimal treatment of acute respiratory infections [25\u201329]. However, antibiotic consumption was not reduced by the use of a molecular point-of-care strategy in adults presenting with acute respiratory illness in a large randomized controlled trial [28]. It seems that we are experiencing a switch in perspectives regarding microbial diagnoses of respiratory infections: physicians are used to dealing with an absence of information, but they will likely be overloaded with information in the near future [30]. The positive detection of respiratory viruses may or may not be useful for the immediate management of a patient [31]. Thus, the development of molecular point-of-care analysis techniques will not lessen the usefulness of our AI strategy. On the contrary, we believe that AI could be a great help in dealing with information overload, which could soon be a common problem. AI methods should not be viewed as ways to replace human expertise but rather as catalysts that accelerate human expertise\u2013based analyses of data. AI methods can assist\u2013rather than replace\u2013in clinical decision-making by transforming complex data into more actionable information. Further studies are needed to assess if AI system integrated with point-of-care rapid molecular respiratory panel assays could be a useful addition for the clinician. Ultimately, randomized controlled trial should determine the effect of this strategy on the decision making regarding antibiotic use.",

Moreover, we did not include cases of acute pneumonia with non-infectious origins.

They did not have the opportunity to interview or directly examine the patients themselves. Furthermore, the experts\u2019 predictions were not performed in \u201creal-life\u201d situation.
