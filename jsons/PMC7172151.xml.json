            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV), the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF), is a complex, large, icosahedral multi-enveloped DNA virus. It is classified as the only member in the family Asfarviridae (Galindo and Alonso, 2017; Arias et al., 2018). The genome of the virus belongs to double-stranded DNA, with the size ranging from 170 kb to 190 kb (Dixon et al., 2013). ASFV mainly infect suids and soft ticks. The suids include domestic pigs and wild boars, and were reported as the natural hosts of the virus (Sanchez-Cordon et al., 2018; Costard et al., 2013). ASFV was firstly discovered in Kenya in 1921 (Arzt et al., 2010). It remained restricted in Africa till 1957, when it was reported in Spain and Portugal. Up to now, the virus has caused ASF outbreaks in more than fifty countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and South America (Costard et al., 2013). The latest reports showed that the virus has caused outbreaks in nearly all provinces of China (Ge et al., 2018; World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2019). Because of the high lethality of ASFV in domestic pigs, the most commonly used strategies to control the virus were the massive culling campaigns and the restriction of pig movement (Sanchez-Cordon et al., 2018). Both strategies have resulted in a huge economic loss for pig industry and affected people\u2019s livelihoods. How to effectively control the virus is still a great challenge for the globe.",

            "text": "The large genetic diversity of ASFVs, which was supposed to hinder the development of effective vaccines or drugs against the virus (Sanchez-Cordon et al., 2018; Escribano et al., 2013; Arabyan et al., 2018), has been investigated in many studies. The ASFV genome encodes over 150 proteins, including viral enzymes, viral transcription and replication-related proteins, structural proteins, other proteins involved in the virus assembly, the evading of host defence systems and the modulation of host cell function, etc (Dixon et al., 2013; Alejo et al., 2018; Kessler et al., 2018). For example, the transcription of the virus is independent on the host RNA polymerase because the virus contains relevant enzymes and factors (Dixon et al., 2013). The viral genome contains a conservative central region of about 12 kb and two variable ends, which results in the variable size of the genome (Dixon et al., 2013; Chapman et al., 2008; de Villiers et al., 2010). There are significant variations among the ASFV genomes due to the genomic insertion or deletion, such as the deletion of the multigene family (MGF) members (Dixon et al., 2013). Although much progress have been made on genetic diversity of the virus, the extent and mechanisms are still not clear. Besides, most of these studies either only investigated the genetic diversity of some common genes, such as p72 and p54 (Fraczyk et al., 2016; Michaud et al., 2013), or only used one to twelve isolate genomes (Dixon et al., 2013; Chapman et al., 2008; de Villiers et al., 2010). The number of discovered viral genomes has increased rapidly as the development of DNA sequencing technology. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the genetic diversity of ASFVs is necessary.",

A few studies on several ASFV genes have suggested the occurrence of homologous recombination in the evolution of ASFVs (Dixon et al., 2013; Fraczyk et al., 2016). However, a comprehensive study on the homologous recombination in ASFV at the genomic scale is lacking, and the role of the recombination on the genetic diversity and the evolution of the virus is still unknown. In this study, we have systematically investigated the genomic diversity and the homologous recombination of ASFVs based on the analysis on all the publicly available ASFV genomes. The results demonstrated that the homologous recombination contributed much to the genetic diversity of ASFVs. This work would help to understand the evolution of the ASFV and thus facilitate the prevention and control of the virus.",

In the phylogenetic tree built with genomic sequences without the recombination regions, the recombinants are the neighbors of a clade containing viruses from Eastern Europe countries (Fig. 3A); while in the tree built with genomic sequences of the recombination regions, the recombinants are the descendants of viruses from Africa (Fig. 3B).",

In another recombination event, the major parent virus Kenya_1950 encoded the genes of DP148R and DP71 L in the recombination region, the latter of which was lost in the recombinant virus Pretorisuskop/96/4.

On average, there were 11 different genes between the gene set of genomes, which was about 7% of the gene set. The number of gene deletions and insertions between genomes was further calculated and shown in Fig. 4\n. The matrix referred to the number of gene deletions when comparing the gene set of ASFV genomes in the row to those in the column. It showed that in most cases there were both gene deletions and insertions when comparing pairwise gene sets of ASFVs. Even for the virus Ken05/Tk1, which encoded the largest number of genes among all ASFVs analyzed, there were still gene insertions when comparing to other genomes (marked by the black star). Among the 34 genes which were involved in gene insertions or deletions, the member of MGF families, especially the MGF-110 and MGF-360, accounted for nearly 70% of gene insertions or deletions (Fig. S10). Unfortunately, most of them had unknown functions.

Then, the distances between adjacent elements for a given repeated element was investigated (Fig. 5\nA). As the size of the elements increased from 5 to 10, the average distance between the adjacent elements also increased because the number of repeated elements in the genome decreased and the repeated elements became more disperse in the genome. Interestingly, the average distance decreased as the size of the elements increased from 11 to 33; it reached to the minimum (136 bp) when the size was 33; then the distance kept unchanged as the size increased from 33 to 49; finally, it increased as the size of repeated element increased from 50 to 100. It should be noted that the average distance was still less than 300 bp even for the repeated elements of 100 bp.

Large diversity was observed among the genomes and the genes of ASFVs, which may lead to diverse phenotype, such as the diversity in antigen and virulence. Indels were found to have a larger contribution to the genetic diversity of ASFVs than the point mutations. This was similar to that observed in a previous study by Lin, during which the author found that insertion/deletion of simple sequence repeat (SSR) could cause large genetic variations in phages (Lin, 2016). Compared to point mutations, indels could introduce a larger variation to the genome, and cause a more severe damage to the genome structures, which may lead to the death of viruses (Wang et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2018). Therefore, only few indels were observed in viruses with small genomes, such as influenza viruses (Taubenberger and Kash, 2010) and hepatitis C viruses (HCV) (Torres-Puente et al., 2007). However, it was more robust for the indels to occur inside the viruses with large genomes, such as ASFVs (Dixon et al., 2013), poxviruses (Elde et al., 2012) and phages (Lin, 2016), because the viruses with large genomes had lots of repeated elements (such as SSRs) and duplicated genes (such as MGFs). Moreover, indels may provide a more efficient way of survival than the point mutations under the natural selection pressure (Dixon et al., 2013; Lin, 2016; Elde et al., 2012), since the virus with indels could rapidly change its phenotype, such as antigen, virulence, or ability of replication and transcription. For example, the deletion of some MGF genes in ASFV could reduce the viral replication or virulence, which may help with the viral infection of soft ticks (Dixon et al., 2013; Burrage et al., 2004).",

The ASFV genomes have five MGF families, each of which has 3\u201322 MGF genes (Dixon et al., 2013). Previous studies have shown that most genome variation in ASFVs was as the result of gain or loss of MGF genes (Dixon et al., 2013). This study found that the member of MGF families were frequently involved in recombinations. They accounted for more than 2/3 of gene insertions or deletions when comparing the proteome of ASFVs. Although most of them had unknown functions until now, they are supposed to play important roles in rapidly changing the phenotypes of the virus.",

The replication slippage may introduce short indels which were widely observed in ASFV genomes, but it is unlikely to cause large indels. This study suggested that the ectopic homologous recombination, during which the segments with unequal length were exchanged (Freitas-Junior et al., 2000), may contribute much to the extensive indels observed in ASFV genomes (Fig. 6\nA). As a proof, significant associations were observed between the occurrence of recombination events and the indels. The clustered repeated elements observed in ASFV genomes may facilitate the homologous recombination (Fig. 5). Taken together, the homologous recombination should be the effective strategy of ASFVs to generate the genetic diversity, which further leads to the diverse phenotypes, including antigen, virulence, replication and transcription ability, and the \u201cweapons\u201d of escaping from the host immunity (Fig. 6B).",

The short repeated elements may facilitate the replication slippage, leading to short indels. For example, Dixon et al. have identified short tandem repeats within the ASFV genes (Dixon et al., 2013), such as E183 L and B602 L, which cause large variations of these genes. Besides the short repeated elements, there are also an abundance of long repeated elements, such as those longer than 30 bp. The clustered long repeated elements can facilitate the ectopic homologous recombination, which lead to large indels including the gene insertions/deletions.",

Identification of the conservative antigenic epitopes or drug targets may help for development of effective vaccines and drugs. Besides, development of drugs targeting host proteins instead of viral proteins may be an alternative strategy (Han et al., 2017). Moreover, since the recombination play a large role in shaping the genetic diversity of the virus, coupling the drugs which inhibit the recombination process with the traditional drugs or vaccines, may help prevention and control of the viral infection.",

            "text": "There were some limitations to this study. Firstly, the number of ASFV genomes was limited, which hindered a comprehensive analysis on the evolution of ASFV genomes. Previous studies have identified over twenty genotypes of ASFVs (Boshoff et al., 2007; Bastos et al., 2003), among which only seven genotypes were included in this study. Fortunately, the isolates included in this study covered a long time period from 1950 to 2018, and also covered a large area including Africa, Europe and China, which were the major areas of the ASFV circulation. Besides, the genotype II, the most widely spread genotype in recent years (Ge et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Quembo et al., 2018; Garigliany et al., 2019), were also included and constituted nearly half of all ASFVs. Thus the results based on these isolates could reflect the genetic diversity of the ASFVs to a large extent. Secondly, the location and size of the indels observed in ASFV genomes may be affected by the sequence alignment algorithm. Two common methods, i.e., MAFFT and ClustalW, for the alignment of ASFV genomes were used in this study. In both methods, the indels were observed to contribute much more to the genetic diversity than the point mutations did (Fig. S3), suggesting the robustness of the results. Lastly, the extensively repeated elements in ASFV genomes could facilitate the frequent occurrence of recombination events. However, some of recombination events cannot be detected by the recombination detection method because of the exchange between the genomic segments with small indels. Such kinds of recombination events are difficult to detect. Increasing the sensitivity of the recombination detection method can help detect them, but may also bring false positives. Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity should be balanced in the recombination detection methods.Overall, this work provided a systematic view of the genetic diversity of ASFVs. Extensive homologous recombination detected in this study may contribute much to the widespread indels observed in ASFV genomes, which further lead to the large genetic diversity of ASFVs. The results on the causes of the diversity of ASFVs would help with the understanding of the evolution of the virus and thus facilitate the prevention and control of ASFVs.",
