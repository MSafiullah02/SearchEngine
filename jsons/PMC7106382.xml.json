These coronaviruses are mainly recognized as causative agents of community-acquired infections. With the exception of SARS and MERS-CoV, there are not many published studies about health-care associated HCoV infections [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV\u2212OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are usually associated with mild diseases in immunocompetent patients, but can cause severe respiratory tract infections in fragile populations. Indeed, development of molecular detection tests for diagnosis has shown that HCoV are clearly responsible for severe infections in immunocompromised patients, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (HSCT) [[6], [7], [8]].",

We also considered more specifically the phylogeny of S gene and included 12 additional sequences from partially sequenced genomes from Caen hospital (France) and one additional published sequence from China (Table supplementary data), making a total of 61 sequences. For each of the two datasets, three distantly related bovine coronaviruses served as outgroup and multiple-sequence alignment was built using MUSCLE from SeaView 4.6.4 followed by a manual correction step taking into account protein coding sequences for coding regions [18,19]. Based on the multiple sequence alignments, similarity between each pair of nucleotide sequences was computed using the Sequence Manipulation Suite [20]. Phylogenetic trees were then inferred using the maximum likelihood method implemented in PhyML 3.1 with a general time reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model, a proportion of invariant sites (+I) and a gamma rate heterogeneity (+\u0393) with 1000 bootstrap replicates [21]. The substitution model was chosen by optimizing the AIC score using smart model selection [22]. A total of 30,815 nucleotides positions were included for the whole genome analysis and 4137 nucleotides positions for S gene. The software FigTree 1.4.4 was used to produce figures [23].",

For this analysis, we added new sequences compared to the phylogenetic analysis. Indeed, we need to examine each position of the sequences separately, which requires a larger support. By doing this, we reduced the chance to select erroneous mutations. The goal is to ensure that the informative mutations found are characteristic of a particular genotype: they are found only in this genotype and are shared by all sequences known for this genotype. In both cases, the signature amino acid substitutions were determined by selecting a subset of informative sites using DIVEIN [24]. Colorization was performed manually to highlight conserved sites.",

The sequence obtained from MDS15 patient was incomplete since a part between positions 7473 and 7689 in orf1ab was missing. Considering the small fragment of sequence missing, the partial full-length sequence obtained from this patient was also included in all phylogenetic analyses. To genotype the HCoV\u2212OC43 isolates, phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by the maximum-likelihood method using sequences of full-length genomes and S genes obtained and compared to those retrieved from GenBank (Fig. 2\nA/B). The tree obtained from full-length genomes showed that MDS sequences are divided into 4 known genotypes B, F and G (Fig. 2A) [25,26,28]. MDS4, MDS6, MDS14 and MDS12 sequences, belonging to the genotype F, are grouped into the same cluster separated from other sequences of genotype F with high bootstrap value (79.6 %). These sequences were obtained from samples collected in 2013 except for the MDS12 sequence that was obtained from sample collected in 2014. This cluster was named \u201ccluster 2013\u201d (Fig. 2A). Among the cluster 2013, MDS6 and MDS14 sequences are closely related (69.2 % bootstrap value), MDS12 sequence is separated from the MDS 6 and MDS14 sequences (100 % bootstrap value) and MDS4 sequence is separated from the 3 other sequences (98.5 % bootstrap value). On the tree, MDS2 and MDS11 sequences are divided within the sequences of genotype G with too low bootstrap values to separate firmly the sequences of this cluster (Fig. 2A). MDS2 and MDS11 sequences were collected during the year 2014 and will be named cluster 2014. Overall, the tree obtained from S gene sequences shows the same distribution of MDS sequences. Notably, the cluster 2013 appears closely related with previous published sequences collected from French patients in 2012 and 2013. In sum, the HCoV\u2212OC43 sequences obtained from clinical samples in this study belong to genotypes B, E, F and G, and 6 of them appear clustered into two distinct clusters.",

The 6 patients divided into the two clusters of cases regularly attended the hospital for in- and outpatient cares, as consultations, day and inpatient hospitalizations. So, they were frequently in contact with health care professionals and hospital visitors that may be considered as multiple sources of HCoV infections, during periods of usual circulation of HCoV\u2212OC43 in France [31]. Outside the hospital, they resided in geographically non-related places and no common activity could be identified. So, the hospital admission seems the only link between the patients, even though we were unable to identify any direct contact between the patients. HCoV\u2212OC43 can be transmitted either by an asymptomatic patient with prolonged shedding, by healthcare worker asymptomatic or with an upper respiratory tract infection [10,32]. Phylogenetic analyses showed that whole-genome sequences included in a same cluster were very closely related, had very high levels of similarities and shared same common ancestors. All these elements provide additional evidence that these infections could be classified as healthcare-associated infections. Similarly, to what is observed for influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus, our data show that HCoV\u2212OC43 is involved in healthcare-associated infections [[33], [34], [35]].",

Thus, we cannot exclude that other patients were involved in the HCoV\u2212OC43 healthcare-associated infections described. In the same way, we were unable to detect infection or asymptomatic portage in healthcare workers of the HSCT unit. Some reports have shown that different HCoV\u2212OC43 strains circulated during a same winter, suggesting that there may be multiple channels of HCoV introduction in hospital [25,42,43]. In fact, the HCoV strains of healthcare-associated infections were probably contracted from one of the strains circulating in the community at that time. For all these reasons, cases reported in this study did not correspond to the definition of nosocomial transmission of pathogens and we used the term of coronavirus healthcare-associated infections.",
