METHODS: Pups were selected from pet shops and breeding facilities and assigned a faecal and clinical score. Standard isolation methods were used to determine presence of parasites, viruses and bacteria in faecal samples. For Escherichia coli, virulence genes were assessed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fifty-six pups were included in this study. Eighteen had no diarrhoea, 22 had no significant clinical signs related to gastroenteritis. Samples were positive for Toxocara canis (n=29), Giardia duodenalis (n=35), Cystoisospora (n=22), E. coli (n=47) and Clostridium perfringens (n=20). In four E. coli positive samples, genes were detected that correlate with pathogenicity in other animal species. A significant positive correlation between the presence of T. canis and faecal score was found. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Puppies obtained from a pet shop or breeding facility have a high risk of gastrointestinal disease. Furthermore, infectious agents may be present independently of faecal or clinical score.

To the authors' knowledge, no previous studies have examined dogs in this age group for a wide variety of enteropathogens, combined with the use of objective parameters to score the health status. Overall, possible infectious agents were detected in all but one pup. This may be an overestimation as pups were considered positive if the group sample was positive for parasitological analyses. However, it is highly likely that if one pup in a group is infected by parasites, the other pups are also infected. The most common isolated parasitic enteropathogen was G. duodenalis, followed by T. canis and Cystoisospora spp. This is in accordance with a recent parasitic study in the Belgian dog population (Claerebout et al. 2009 ). This result might have been expected as dogs, younger than six months old and living in large groups, have an increased risk of contracting a parasitic infection (Claerebout et al. 2009 , Gates et al. 2009 ). It is, however, possible that the presence of some pathogens is underestimated. For example, the sensitivity of faecal examination for detection of G. duodenalis by means of IFA is over 90% (Geurden et al. 2008 ), but because of intermittent excretion some infected animals may have been overlooked (Epe et al. 2010) . Toxocara canis is a well-known parasite in pet shops and breeding facilities and regular deworming schedules were maintained. All pups, of which the deworming status was known, were dewormed less than a month before sampling. However, half of the sampled population was positive for T. canis. This could also be an underestimation as only the adult T. canis worms are detected and not the migrating larvae. A plausible explanation is that the hygiene measures are inadequate to avoid reinfection. Indeed, the eggs and oocysts of the parasites are very resistant and a correct disinfectant and frequent cleaning are of primary All the facilities had a history of clinical problems with G. duodenalis, one had a history with Cystoisospora spp. and CPV, one with T. canis and one with CPV.

Of these Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. are the most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli and C. perfringens can easily be found because they are part of the normal intestinal microflora and only after detecting virulence genes, these strains may be suspected to be implicated in the development of diarrhoea. The interpretation of these results is therefore difficult (Hall 2004) . There is, however, growing evidence that certain E. coli strains may cause intestinal disease in dogs (Beutin et al. 1993 , Hammermueller et al. 1995 , Star\u010di\u010d et al. 2002 . Actually, no unambiguous differentiation is possible between non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains. In this study, a very small number of samples contained genes known to be present in Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and code for the production of enterotoxins. It is remarkable that the only sample containing STa as well as STb genes originated from a pup with severe diarrhoea.
