The deletion of S gene allows the manipulation of the replicon in a conventional laboratory instead of using a BSL3 facility.

Moreover, our newly constructed replicon is a stable BAC system and can be easily amplified in E. coli and manipulated by reverse genetics.

Bat SL-CoVs and SARS-CoV have a high similarity in genome organization, gene and gene product sequences, particularly in replicase proteins (96\u201398% amino acid identity) [3], [4], [5], suggesting that the function of most of these replicase proteins is conserved among different SARS and SARS-like CoVs. Even though the pathogenesis of bat SL-CoVs in human is unknown, there is a high potential of other related CoVs of bat origin to infect and cause diseases in human. In this regard, it is important to stress that our replicon system can be used to screen for drugs with equal effect to SARS-CoV or other unknown but closely related bat CoVs which could potentially emerge in the future.",
