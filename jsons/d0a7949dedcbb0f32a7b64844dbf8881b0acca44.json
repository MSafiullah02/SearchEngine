Variable degrees of cognitive and neuropsychiatric involvement already exist in MS patients. Cognitive dysfunction affects up to 70% of MS patients. It can be present even in the early stages of the disease, and is especially pronounced in the information processing speed and immediate and episodic memory domains [5] . Anxiety and depression have been reported in up to 57% [3] and 40% [4] of these patients respectively which is highly above the rates in general population. Depression and anxiety result in a lower quality of life, increased fatigue and disability scores, and a more aggressive MS course [6] . They have been shown to result in disease exacerbations and decreased treatment adherence in MS patients [7] . Additionally, several studies have shown that anxiety and depression can further impair cognitive function in MS patients. Depression negatively affects cognition by direct and indirect mechanisms, through reducing information processing speed and deleterious effects on cognitive reserve respectively [8] . Researchers have shown that anxiety harms verbal learning in MS patients, probably through interfering with attention and information processing speed. They have suggested that treatment of anxiety may improve cognitive function of MS patients [9] .",

However, patients with MS are known to undertake maladaptive coping strategies [10] which will make them even more susceptible to the detrimental neuropsychiatric effects of the outbreak. Most MS patients are on immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Patients on immunosuppressive agents are theoretically at increased risk of being affected by viral pandemics and a higher level of health anxiety in this group of patients is anticipated. Moreover, MS patients are losing social support; they have no longer access to group therapies and cognitive and physical rehabilitation therapies which could all hypothetically add to the level and stress and anxiety perceived by these patients.",

We suggest monitoring high risk MS patients using easily phone applicable anxiety scales and to consider therapeutic options including online support, at home yoga and exercise programs, and antianxiety medications when needed.",
