The MALDI-ToF MS technique analyzes the total protein of culturable microorganisms at the species level and produces a mass spectra based on peptides which is compared to a database of identified profiles. Consequently, unique signatures of each microorganism are produced allowing identification at the species and, more importantly, strain level. Our present study proposes that the MALDI-ToF MS can be further used to screen functional and metabolic differences. While other studies applied the MALDI-ToF technique to identify subgroups within species, we investigated how various environmental factors could alter the unique bacterial signatures. We found that genetic and phenotypic differences between microorganisms belonging to the same species can be reflected in peptide-mass fingerprints generated by MALDI-ToF MS.",

Studies have shown that MALDI-ToF MS can equally or even better identify sources of systemic infections2,3, urinary tract infections4 6, respiratory tract infections7 and intestinal infections8,9. The MALDI-ToF MS technology allows for identification down to the strain level and has been shown to discriminate between strains of methicillin-resistant (rep-PCR), housekeeping gene (e.g., PheS) sequence analysis20, and whole genome sequencing21, 22 . Each of these approaches has been shown to have adequately high resolution to distinguish microbial strains from one another; however, these approaches are labor-and time-intensive as well as costly techniques that might lack the required rapid high-throughput nature of MALDI-ToF. A big advantage of the MALDI-ToF MS strain typing application would be epidemiologic investigations that require rapid identification of a single strain within a single species to determine the origin and spread of an outbreak in order to mitigate risks to public safety posed by microbial food and water contamination or potential acts of bioterrorism 16,23. Moreover, in an era where microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutic targets are envisioned24, this technology could provide a framework to link disease phenotypes to peptides translated by microorganisms isolated from various biological samples.",

Baseline noise was removed using the statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak clipping (or SNIP) algorithm with 100 iterations. The data were then normalized using total ion current (or TIC) calibration, which sets the total intensity to 1. Multiple spectra within the same analysis were aligned to the same x-axis using the Lowess warping method, a signal-tonoise ratio of 3, and a tolerance of 0.001.

To investigate the capabilities of MALDI-ToF to distinguish strain-level differences, we analyzed three different gramnegative bacteria. fragilis and Y. enterocolitica, the MALDI-ToF can also differentiate lab strains of E. coli from the highly pathogenic EPEC (Figure 1C ).

The overlapping of MC and EMB-grown E. coli is likely due to the lactose fermentation process undergone by E. coli when it is grown on these two types of agars. While the differences between MC and EMB agars did not discriminate between the E. coli colonies grown on these two types of media, the presence of 5% defibrinated sheep blood in the TSA was enough to trigger the expression of a different proteomic profile in E. coli grown on TSBA relative to TSA ( Figure 2B ).

Interestingly, fresh or frozen status had less of an impact on the clustering of B. ovatus from patient 2, while patient 1 had high variability of PMFs within fresh and frozen groups. The different sensitivity between patient 1 and patient 2 B. ovatus isolates from fresh and frozen stool may be due to the presence of more temperature sensitive genes in the isolates from patient 1 and indicate that freezing stool may alter the PMF of MALDI-ToF in a bacteria-dependent manner.",

Other studies have investigated whether these environmental and culture conditions can impact the MALDI-ToF identification of bacteria. Our experiments took it one step further and demonstrate that the MALDI-ToF can easily differentiate the direct effects of environmental conditions on the bacteria, allowing identification of biological environmental influences as it affects the proteomic profile of microorganisms. To further understand the extent of the MALDI-ToF MS technique on discerning environmental influences on bacteria, we tested if previous environmental stressors can impact PMF clustering. For this experiment, DH5 was grown in liquid culture at 37\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C for 2 hour and then plated on TSA for 24 hours. Whereas our previous experiment measured the direct environmental impact of temperature on DH5 (Figure 2D), this experiment examined if the MALDI-ToF could sense the same temperature effects after the bacteria was removed from that conditions and plated. As expected, the PMF profiles of DH5 grown in the two different cultures had distinct clusters (Figure 2E-F). While there were some overlaps in clusters, this data demonstrates that the MALDI-ToF can identify environmental conditioning effects despite the removal of the immediate conditions. These results have major implications in the lab setting where microorganisms isolated from biological samples are often studied ex vivo. Our ability to detect environmental conditionings even when the bacteria is removed from the initial stresses further highlight the advantage of proteotyping using the MALDI-ToF MS. PMFs identify metabolic and virulent states of Y. enterocolitica during in vitro adhesion and invasion assay MALDI-TOF analysis of Y. enterocolitica at the various temperatures demonstrated that PMF can potentially distinguish between virulent states. Other than temperature, Y. enterocolitica has different metabolic states during infection and various genes that are modified during the course of infection44. The stages of Y. enterocolitica infection were investigated using human intestinal cells, SW620s. PMFs of untreated Y. enterocolitica,",

These results exemplify a need for rigorous sample preparation and analysis. Given our ability to proteotype bacteria by various environmental factors, there is huge potential in analyzing phenotypic differences amongst clinical samples. There are numerous applications should this methodology be adapted in the clinic such as distinguishing proteotypes from inflammatory, nutrient-rich or -depleted, or competitive microenvironments.CONCLUSIONSThe emergence of MALDI-ToF MS has reinvigorated microbial identification over the past decade. By creating proteomic signatures through PMFs of microorganisms, species and subspecies identification is possible via proteotyping. Routine use of MALDI-ToF MS as a diagnostic tool is favorable due to its ease of use, time and cost efficiency, and robust sensitivity. Our current study demonstrates a new function by exploiting the unique proteomic signatures and comparative analysis afforded by the MALDI-ToF MS bioinformatic packages.

While the technique lacks discriminatory power with some species such as Enterococucs faecium and Staphylococcus aureus25, the MALDI-ToF MS can robustly identify bacterial species in In contrast to studies that evaluate the ability of MALDI-ToF MS ability to identify bacterial species regardless of environmental conditions, we propose that the variation of MALDI-ToF MS-produced peaks due to culturing can detect environmental imprints. By comparing PMF peaks and observing the differences in dendrogram and principal component of analysis (PCA) format (Diagram D and E), we report that the MALDI-ToF can reliably differentiate between various conditions including oxygen presence, nutrient availability and temperature stress. The MALDI-ToF MS is also able to detect previous environmental conditions after culturing out of the initial environment. Our study shows that the MALDI-ToF can be applied to screening bacterial isolates from various environmental conditions and biological samples in order to see potential functional differences within the same microorganism.DH5 Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic E. coli were grown on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours.

For testing of various growth agar, E. coli DH5 was plated on TSA, TSBA, McConkey and eosin methylene blue agars. The plates were then incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours.

Samples were then plated on TSA in serial dilutions to enumerate Y. enterocolitica colonization. In parallel, wells containing media only were infected with an equal amount of bacteria.

ETBF strains are associated with inflammatory diarrheal disease in children older than 1 year of age and in adults as well as in inflammatory bowel disease flare-ups and colorectal cancer31 34. In this experiment, the BFT positive strain of B. fragilis (BFT+) was grown alongside its mutant (BFT-) on TSA supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C anaerobically. Multiple colonies of the WT strain and mutant were tested in four technical replicates each on a MALDI-ToF target following protein extraction. A PCA was generated after analyzing the peptide mass fingerprint profiles of each colony, showing statistically significant differences between the proteomic profiles of the WT strain and mutant. The PMFs were generated using MALDIquant package in R. The mean PMF of the biological replicates from each cluster is shown by the larger point in the middle of each ellipse. This experiment clearly shows that the MALDI-ToF MS is sensitive enough to detect small genetic differences in highly similar microorganisms as it can reliably discriminate between the enterotoxigenic B.fragilis strain and a genetic mutant for the B. fragilis toxin(Figure 1A). gram-negative bacteria is Yersinia enterocolitica. Y. enterocolitica is a common food-borne disease found in contaminated water and meat. Y. enterocolitica is a transient infection in immunocompetent adults but can be deadly to immunocompromised individuals especially young children under the age of five35,36. As before, the various strains of Y. enterocolitica were grown on simultaneously prior to protein extraction and analysis through MALDI-ToF MS. The three strains of Y. enterocolitica were grown on TSA for 48 hours aerobically at room temperature. Using the MALDI-ToF, we are able to see three distinct clusters among a wild type Y. enterocolitica strain (Ye8081) and two mutants of the same strain that are lacking an adhesion gene, YadA, or a Yersinia translocation protein (YscA)(Figure 1B). coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestines. While most E. coli strains are harmless, pathogenic varieties can cause serious gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, meningitis or septic shock in humans37.Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is a strain of E. coli that uses a virulence factor known as intimin, an adhesin that binds host intestinal cells, causing watery diarrhea in those afflicted38. In this experiment, EPEC was grown alongside a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli, DH5 on TSA for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C aerobically. As we demonstrated with the B.",

In order to test whether environmental differences could reproducibly impact the proteome of several microorganisms, we decided to look at various environmental factors such as aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, various culturing medias, and different incubation temperatures on how they impact the PMF profile of the tested microorganisms.The first environmental factor tested was presence or absence of oxygen. Using the microorganism Lactobacillus reuteri, we investigated if MALDI-ToF MS analysis could detect differences in PMF following overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C in aerobic and anaerobic environments. Lactobacillus spp. are facultative anaerobes and several genes are differently expressed with the presence of oxygen41. Consequently, our experiment reveals that despite using the same starting culture, aerobic or anaerobic conditions cause significant alterations in the PMF profile of the same microbial strain",

The two clusters for Y. enterocolitica are clearly separated on the x-axis with over 60% of the PMF various explained on PC1, demonstrating a clear distinction in proteome expressions due to temperature conditions. The individual PMFs of Y. enterocolitica grown at room temperature are also more tightly clustered than the Y. enterocolitica grown at 37\u00b0C. These clustering could be indicative of more variable protein expression of Y. enterocolitica when grown in virulence-inducing temperatures. Previous studies using MALDI-ToF MS on Y. enterocolitica point out that temperature and media both play a role in PMF intensities with inference that temperature may play a bigger role26,27. Whereas Wunschel and collegues26 identified that Y. enterocolitica grown at 37\u00b0C has similar PMFs despite the media, we demonstrate that the MALDI-ToF can reliably distinguish between the temperature conditions.",

This methodology can be especially useful for analyzing phenotypic changes of bacteria cultured from previously unique environments such as an inflamed gastrointestinal tract or progression through virulence. In addition to the original function of species identification, the MALDI-ToF MS provides a plethora of data that has yet to be fully explored and exploited. Pairing these data with peptide/protein identity assignment could ultimately constitute a strong framework for the identification of microbiome-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various disease states.
