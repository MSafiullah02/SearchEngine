Therefore, anti-viral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), empirical antibiotics, and symptomatic respiratory treatment for COVID-19 infection as well as treatment for DKA were also performed. The DKA was improved after proper insulin treatment, but the dyspnea and radiologic finding worsened. Mechanical ventilation was initiated on the fourth day of admission.
