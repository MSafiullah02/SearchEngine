Dihydroxychromones, a class of naturally-occurring flavonoids with proven stability and safety,5 share the similar structural motif to the diketoacid of an ADK: two phenolic hydroxyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen serve together as an excellent mimic for the diketoacid functionality (Fig. 1). In addition, compared with an ADK with substituents attached only on one side of the diketoacid, various functionalities can be introduced to both sides of the dihydroxychromone core to allow extended investigation of the pharmacophore space. Thus, we designed novel dihydroxychromone derivatives with an arylmethyl functionality shown to play a critical role in inhibitory activity of ADKs3 as well as a catechol moiety known to be responsible for various biological activities of flavonols6 on either side (2 and 3, Fig. 2\n) or both sides (4, Fig. 2) of the dihydroxychromone scaffold. Herein, we present a novel pharmacophore model of SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase inhibitors via syntheses and biological evaluation of three classes of dihydroxychromone derivatives.",

The inhibitory activity of quercetin (3a) was also improved upon introduction of arylmethyl substituent at 7-O position (4a\u20134c, Table 1). It is noteworthy that flavonol derivatives with free catechol moieties (4a\u20134c) are usually two to three times more active than the protected catechol counterparts (4d\u20134f). The synergistic effect of the two substituents attached to the opposite side of the dihydrochromone core suggests the presence of two distinct binding sites on the target enzyme: a hydrophobic arylmethyl binding site and a catechol binding site capable of hydrogen bonding interaction.",

The synthesized dihydroxychromones showed selective inhibition against duplex DNA-unwinding activity of SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase. Moreover, the inhibitory activity was enhanced by combination of the two spatially separated substituents, which indicates two different binding sites in the target enzyme. Taken together, an extended feature of the pharmacophore model was proposed which is constituted of a diketoacid core, a hydrophobic arylmethyl substituent, and a free catechol unit. Further structure\u2013activity study around the proposed pharmacophore model is warranted for discovery of more potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase.",
