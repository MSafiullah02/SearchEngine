The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics for dogs and cats with MRLN mass lesions would differ for inflammatory vs. neoplastic etiologies. Dogs and cats with MRLN mass lesions that had undergone MRI and had a confirmed cytological or histopathological diagnosis were recruited from medical record archives. Clinical findings were recorded by one observer and MRI characteristics were recorded by two other observers who were unaware of clinical findings. A total of 31 patients were sampled, with 15 in the inflammatory lymphadenitis group and 16 in the neoplasia group. Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were more likely to be younger and present with lethargy (P = 0.001), pyrexia (P = 0.000), and neck pain (P = 0.006). Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were also more likely to have a leukocystosis (P = 0.02) and segmental neutrophilia (P = 0.001). Inflammatory masses were more likely to have moderate or marked MRI perinodal contrast enhancement (P = 0.021) and local muscle contrast enhancement (P = 0.03) whereas the neoplastic masses were more likely to have greater MRI width (P = 0.002) and height (P = 0.009). In conclusion, findings indicated that some clinical and MRI characteristics differed for dogs and cats with inflammatory vs. neoplastic medial retropharyngeal lymph node masses. Although histopathological or cytological diagnosis remains necessary for confirmation, these findings may help with the ranking of differential diagnoses of future cases.

Infectious lymphadenitis has been reported secondary to bacterial (Mycobacterium spp., Pasteurella spp., Bacteriodes spp., Fusobacerium spp., Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Bartonella spp.), fungal (systemic histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and sporotrichosis), protozoal, algal, or metazoal infections and can have suppurative and nonsuppurative forms. 13-15 Lymphadenitis has been described as a primary or secondary condition and has been associated with other diseases such as juvenile cellulitis (puppy strangles) in which diffuse lymphadenomegaly can be observed. 5 Secondary lymphadenitis has been reported in response to the lymphatic drainage of inflammatory agents and/or their products. Disruptions in lymph drainage have been suggested as an underlying cause for edema, inflammation, abscessation, and granulomatous reaction. Clinical reports of dogs with lymphadenitis have described signs of lethargy and pyrexia associated with leucocytosis and visible lymph node enlargement. 13, 14, 16 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established as a technique for evaluating patients with cervical mass lesions.

An age of 6.5 years was identified as being the most sensitive and specific cut off from the receiver operating curve statistics. This finding is consistent with the veterinary literature in which neoplasia is associated with an older age demographic and lymphadenitis is mostly reported in young dogs. 4, 16, 24 Similarly, in human medicine, cervical lymphadenitis is described predominantly in children and young adults. 15, 19, 25 The historical finding of lethargy was significantly more likely to be present in the nonneoplastic inflammatory group than the neoplastic group. This is consistent with the literature that report tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma-bearing patients infrequently present with lethargy or anorexia, although when present, these signs are associated with a significantly shorter survival time and a poorer outcome. 4 Dysphagia has also been reported in these patients. 4 In our study four cases with neoplastic masses presented with dysphagia may have been due to the mass effect compressing on the oropharyngeal region or from invasion of hypoglossal nerve, which runs along the medial aspect of the medial retropharyngeal lymph node and provides motor innervation to the tongue for participation in the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing. 16 On physical examination in this study lymphadenitis cases were statistically more likely to be pyrexic and to demonstrate neck pain. These clinical signs have been described widely in relation to cranial cervical lymphadenitis both in the human and veterinary literature and have been related to the extension of inflammation outside of the lymph node capsule, and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines. 16, 25, 26 An underlying cause for the lymphadenitis lesions was not identified in the majority of cases and they were therefore presumed to be immune mediated. Despite 12 of 16 of the lymphadenitis lesions being cultured only one yielded bacterial growth. This might be due to the administration of antibiotics prior to presentation of the culture-negative cases. In children, the most common cause for lymphadenitis is an acute bacterial infection including mycobacterial infection extending from the oropharynx or elsewhere. 15, 27 In dogs, lymphadenitis has been associated with Bartonella henselae, Talaromyces helicus, mycobacterial infections, and juvenile cellulitis (puppy strangles). 3, 13, 14, 24, 28 Upon assessment of the mass lesions and perinodal tissues significant differences between the two groups were identified. The size of normal medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes has been assessed with MRI in dogs and described as having an approximate width of 5-10 mm and a height of 10 mm. 8, 29, 30 The width and height dimensions of the mass lesions were significantly larger in the neoplastic group in our study however the height:width ratio was not statistically different between the neoplastic and inflammatory groups. The ultrasonographic dimensions of lymph nodes have been assessed for their ability to differentiate neoplastic from nonneoplastic nodes in dogs. Similar to our findings neoplastic lymph nodes were identified as being larger when compared with nonneoplastic (hyperplastic or inflammatory) lymphadenomegaly. 31 Despite these findings, it is important to bear in mind that in both the medical and veterinary literature it is reported that size is not a reliable marker for neoplastic infiltration, as small nodes can harbor small metastases. [32] [33] [34] [35] The presence of perinodal enhancement and muscle contrast enhancement was significantly more likely to be associated with an inflammatory rather than a neoplastic etiology. The high presence of perinodal contrast enhancement and inflammation around inflammatory lymph nodes is consistent with those findings described in computed tomographic studies of lymphadenitis lesions and lymph node abscessation where fat stranding, reticulation, and peripheral contrast enhancement is described. 18, 36 There are several imaging features documented in the literature that are suggested to indicate the presence of lymph node metastasis that were not identified as being significantly more likely in the neoplastic group over the inflammatory group in our study. These features include the loss of nodal hilar structure, the presence of central necrosis or cavitation, and irregular margination due to capsular invasion. 35, 37 This disparity is likely due to the fact that these studies compared reactive lymph nodes to early-stage metastasis, which is a very different cohort of pathologies from our study. Our inclusion criteria required patients to have mass lesions and were therefore at a late stage of metastasis or had an advanced inflammatory lesion.
