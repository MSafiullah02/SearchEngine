Nosocomial pathogens originating from colonized or infected patients can contaminate the environment and survive for extended periods. As a result, the hospital environment has become an important source (and or reservoir) of multiresistant bacteria capable of colonizing or infecting patients. Environmental surfaces have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks of multiresistant bacteria (Hayden, 2000; Talon, 1999) and community outbreaks of hepatitits A and acute gastroenteritis due to other viruses (Evans et al., 2002; Leoni et al., 1998; Love et al., 2002) . Still these problems do not justify routine disinfection of surfaces and fomites, but targeted use of disinfectants is an important factor in preventing infections in the hospitals (and possibly in the community).",

It can be accomplished by the use of liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization in healthcare settings. Disinfection is aimed at minimizing the risk of transfer of microorganisms, but this process does not inactivate all microorganisms; bacterial endospores usually survive. Disinfection differs from sterilization by its lack of sporocidal activity, but a few disinfectants (frequently referred to as \"chemical sterilants\") will kill spores after prolonged exposure times (6-10 hr). At similar concentrations but with shorter exposure periods (\u03fd30 min), these disinfectants may kill all microorganisms with the exception of high numbers of bacterial spores and are called \"high level disinfectants\". Disinfectants that kill only most vegetative bacteria, some fungi, and some viruses (\u054510 minutes) are called \"low level disinfectants\" (Rutala, 1996) .",

The aetiological agents of these diseases are excreted in high numbers in the faeces of infected individuals and are able to persist for extended periods of time in the environment (Evans et al., 2002; Kawai and Feinstone, 2000) . In many outbreaks, surfaces may act as vehicles for the spread of the infection (Leoni et al., 1998; Lloyd-Evans et al., 1986; Weniger et al., 1983) . During viral infections of the respiratory tract, patients shed large amounts of virus into their naso-tracheal secretions and these can contaminate the environment. Respiratory viruses, such as respiratory synscytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus have been shown to survive for extended periods in suspensions and on surfaces (Brady et al., 1990; Hall et al., 1980; Hendley et al., 1973; Sizun et al., 2000) . Transmission of rhinovirus infection by contaminated surfaces was also shown in an experimental study (Gwaltney and Hendley, 1982) . Contaminated environmental surfaces are considered to represent a significant vector for viral infections in the community and, also in paediatric units in the hospital. Next to direct droplet transmission, indirect transmission (environment \u2192 hands \u2192 self-inoculation of mucous membranes) is probably even more important in spreading viral respiratory diseases.",

Although percutaneous injuries are among the most efficient modes of HBV transmission, these exposures probably account for only a part of these infections among HCWs. In several investigations of nosocomial hepatitits B outbreaks, most infected HCWs could not recall an overt percutaneous injury, although in some studies, up to one third of infected HCWs recalled caring for a patient who was HBsAg-positive. In addition, HBV demonstrated to survive in dried blood at room temperature on environmental surfaces for at least 1 week. The potential for HBV transmission through contact with environmental surfaces has furthermore been demonstrated in investigations of HBV outbreaks among patients and staff of haemodialysis units. Data on survival of HCV and HIV in the environment are limited (Bolyard et al., 1998; CDC, 2003b; Sattar et al., 2001) . Transmission of these viruses from patient to staff or from patient to patient could theoretically be mediated by contaminated surfaces and instruments and avoiding contact with contaminated materials are valuable means of protection.

A dry system is preferred for the cleaning of floors and particular materials. The dry system uses little or no liquid. Floors remain dry during cleaning and can be used by HCWs and patients immediately after cleaning without the danger of slipping. While recent wet cleaning or fluid spillage promotes the growth of Gram-negative organisms, these pathogens are rare in dry cleaned environments (Ayliffe et al., 1990; Dharan et al., 1999) . Ballemans et al. (2003) conducted an experimental prospective study over a 10-week period and compared a new dry cleaning method, using humidified high-performance cloths with the wet routine cleaning practice. They showed a statistically significant reduction of the total viable counts, for the new dry cleaning method compared with the wet mopping. Unfortunately the study did not look into the impact on infection rates and/or reduced cross-contamination. Despite these results, dry cleaning is not sufficient to remove \"stuck-on dirt\"; a wet system must be used. Wet cleaning has to be the choice in departments where frequent spilling occurs (e.g., intensive care units). In general, wet cleaning of large surface is always preceded by dry mopping (WIP, 2002 Module 6.4).",

Tables 1-7 give the advised frequency of routine cleaning according to the national Dutch infection control guidelines (WIP) in the nursing department (Table 1) , isolation rooms (Tables 2-4), outpatients' clinic (Table 5) , operating department (Table 6) , and in \"other\" rooms within healthcare institutions (Table 7) If not in use at the weekend, then clean 5 days in a week. Routine cleaning of environmental surfaces with detergents and elimination of heavy dust is sufficient in most circumstances (WIP, 2002 Module 6.4) . Detergents, disinfectants, and cleaning equipment itself may become a source of contamination. Werry et al. (1988) reported contamination of detergent solutions used for cleaning of surfaces. The contaminants, mainly Gram-negative non-fermentative bacilli, including Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Since contamination may occur during the preparation of fresh solutions, cleaning solutions must be prepared daily or as needed, and frequently be replaced with fresh solution according to facility policies. The mop head should be changed at the beginning of each day and/or after cleaning up large spills of blood or other body substances. The use of disposable materials is preferred for all methods of cleaning. When using non-disposable materials, they have to be sent to the laundry service immediately after completing a cleaning job (WIP, 2002 Module 6.4). Rutala et al. (2000) reviewed the epidemiological and microbiological data regarding the use of disinfectants on noncritical surfaces. They concluded to disinfect housekeeping and noncritical patient care equipment-surfaces given the minimal extra cost and added antimicrobial activity. Still, the routine use of disinfectants to clean hospital floors and other surfaces is controversial and the influence on nosocomial infections unclear. Danforth et al. (1987) compared the influence of disinfection vs cleaning using plain soap on nosocomial infection rates during a 6-month period. The combined nosocomial infection rate for the eight acute-care nursing wards did not differ between the disinfectant and detergent groups. No differences in floor contamination were observed. Comparing detergent-and disinfectant-use, Dharan et al. (1999) observed no change in the incidence of hospital-acquired infections during a 4-month trial period compared to the preceding 12 months.",

When chlorine reacts with proteinaceous material, such as blood, some of the chlorine combines with proteins and forms N-chloro compounds. The surface should be cleaned before the disinfectant is applied. Otherwise, a high concentration of available chlorine is required to inactivate virus in the presence of undiluted blood. Surfaces contaminated by blood or other body fluids which cannot be physically cleaned before disinfection, should be disinfected with 0.5% (5,000 ppm, i.e., 1:10 dilution) available chlorine or iodine. On the other hand, if the surface is hard and smooth and has been cleaned appropriately, 0.05% (500 ppm, i.e., 1:100) solutions are sufficient. Higher concentrations (1,000 ppm) are required to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Once surfaces and objects have been cleaned, they must be in contact with the chlorine (\"wet\") for at least 5 min. This is the minimum time required to let the disinfectant take effect. After disinfection surfaces should be allowed to air dry (Rutala, 1996) . Clostridium difficile has been associated with outbreaks of diarrhea and colitis in hospitalized adults, especially those receiving antimicrobial therapy. Although there is evidence of person-to-person transmission in the hospital as well as transmission via contaminated environmental surfaces and transiently colonized hands, control of C. difficile is usually achieved by proficient cleaning of environmental surfaces (McFarland et al., 1989) . In order to reduce surface contamination and to control outbreaks, the use of sodium hypochlorite solutions (500 and 1,600 ppm) were shown to be more effective than chlorine. Thus, in outbreak situations, sodium hypochlorite should be the disinfectant of choice in reducing the levels of environmental contamination with C. difficile .",

Sattar et al. (1993) determined that chlorine, phenolic, and phenol/ethanol products prevented rotavirus transmission from stainless steel disks to fingerpads. Infection occurred in 63% to 100% of volunteers who licked rotaviruscontaminated fingers/surfaces, but no volunteers became infected after licking contaminated surfaces that had been disinfected with the phenolic/ethanol spray.

Sodium hypochlorite has the additional advantage of being considerably less expensive than commercially available phenolic and quaternary disinfectants. Also, cleaning with sodium hypochlorite solutions may exacerbate respiratory disorders in some patients. When sodium hypochlorite is inappropriate, a phenolic or quaternary ammonium compound may be the preferred alternative. The phenolic detergents are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and bactericidal at their recommended use-dilution. The quaternary ammonium compounds sold as hospital disinfectants are generally fungicidal, bactericidal, and virucidal against lipophilic viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV, HSV-1); they are not sporocidal and generally not tuberculocidal or virucidal against hydrophilic viruses (Rutala, 1996) .",

Repeated exposure of hospital pathogens to antibiotics can lead to resistance, and also a similarly intensive exposure to antiseptics and disinfectants might result in a possible resistance to these agents. Russell et al. (1998) have developed stable chlorhexidine resistance in some strains of Pseudomonas stutzeri by exposure to increasing concentrations of the bisbiguanide. The chlorhexidine-resistant strains showed a variable increase in resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds and to trichlosan. Additionally, these chlorhexidine-resistant strains demonstrated a variable increase in resistance to polymyxin B, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, and ampicillin. They concluded that concomitant antibiotic and antiseptic resistance in Gramnegative bacteria may occur. Thomas et al. (2000) reported a stable increase in chlorhexidine MICs for P. aeruginosa after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations simulating residual levels of this antiseptic in the environment. Increases in resistance may result from exposure of microorganisms to sublethal doses of disinfectants. The high organic load or bioburden protects the bacteria and requires higher concentrations of the disinfectant to reach the disinfecting efficacy on the predominant microflora (Gebel et al., 2002) .",
