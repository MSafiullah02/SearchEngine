            "text": "A B S T R A C T As bioenergy produces neutral or even negative carbon emissions, the assessment of biomass resources and associated emissions mitigation is a key step toward a low carbon future. However, relevant comprehensive estimates lack in China. Here, we measure the energy potential of China's domestic biomass resources (including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge) from 2000 to 2016 and draw the spatial-temporal variation trajectories at provincial resolution. Scenario analysis and life cycle assessment are also applied to discuss the greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. Results show that the collectable potential of domestic biomass resources increased from 18.31 EJ in 2000 to 22.67 EJ in 2016 with overall uncertainties fluctuating between (\u00c0 26.6%, 39.7%) and (\u00c0 27.6%, 39.5%). Taking energy crops into account, the total potential in 2016 (32.69 EJ) was equivalent to 27.6% of China's energy consumption. If this potential can be realized in a planned way to displace fossil fuels during the period 2020-2050, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation would be in the range of 1652.73-5859.56 Mt CO 2 -equivalent, in which the negative greenhouse gas emissions due to the introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would account for 923.78-1344.13 Mt CO 2 -equivalent. Contrary to increasing bioenergy potentials in most provinces, there are declining trends in Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhejiang. In addition, Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia would have the highest associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. This study can provide valuable guidance on the exploitation of China's untapped biomass resources for the mitigation of global climate change.",

A recent study indicated that the global potential of biomass resources would be approximately 100-600 EJ by 2050 [2] , which is equivalent to 15-65% of primary energy demand, according to the estimates of the International Energy Agency [3] . Besides its dominant role in the renewable energy mix, bioenergy, as the only renewable carbon source, is considered as the most promising alternative for fossil energy with a potential to abate greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Generally, the carbon in bioenergy derives from the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) which is sequestered by photosynthesis during biomass growth [4] . Thus, bioenergy utilization could result in neutral or even negative carbon emissions if coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Toward a low carbon future, the assessments of biomass resources availability and associated GHG mitigation potentials constitute the foundation for bioenergy chains planning.",

Currently, hydropower is responsible for the highest share of renewable energy generation, but it has negative impacts on river ecosystems [5] [6] [7] . Whilst China has been the world's top carbon emitter since 2007, considering the huge pressure posed by both environment preservation and climate change, biomass resources represented by energy crops (EC) have attracted much attention in China. Bioenergy is the domestic third-largest energy source after coal and oil, contributing to 15% of energy consumption in 2017 [8] . Moreover, while the Chinese government made a voluntary mitigation commitment with a peak of CO 2 emission by 2030, there is a growing interest in bioenergy as it is a low, neutral and even negative emissions technology. In this context, it is imperative to evaluate the biomass resources with spatial-temporal distribution and their potential to reduce GHG emissions in China.",

GIS technique, especially when coupled with remote sensing, can estimate the regionalized and aggregated potentials of biomass resources [9] [10] [11] . However, it is solely applicable to few biomass categories. Statistical analysis is the most widely used method on both regional and national scales since the primary data is comprehensive and easily accessible. Accordingly, the theoretical potential of biomass residues can be directly assessed [12, 13] . Collectable potential and utilizable potential could then be quantified, considering significant technical and economic-environmental constraints [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . For China, Yang et al. [20] analyzed the energy potential of predominant biomass resources, which amounted to 887 Mtce in 2007. Zhou et al. [21] evaluated that the collectable potential of China's major biomass resources in 2008 was about 18.8 EJ. However, these studies were performed based on outdated data and a coarse classification of biomass resources. On the other hand, since different values of key parameters were used for the quantitative appraisal, the results were diverse.",

GHG emissions analysis, focusing on the sustainability concerns of biomass resources for possible energy use, has been emphasized in previous studies [22] [23] [24] [25] . The climate change abatement potential is mainly identified through two methods: integrated assessment model (IAM) and life cycle assessment (LCA). IAM is carried out estimating GHG mitigation potentials at a global-level with idealized assumptions and it is generally used to explore climate strategies and scenarios on the macro level [26] . However, the narrow boundaries of its environmental impact assessment make it unable to reflect life cycle effects on the micro scale [27, 28] . In contrast, cradle-to-grave LCA, typically includes process-based LCA (bottom-up method), input-output-based LCA (top-down method applied to economic data) and hybrid LCA (combining the first two methods), has higher precision and completeness for certain regions and technologies [29] . For instance, Wu et al. [30, 31] assessed the carbon emissions and water footprint of coal-fired generation systems in China, integrating process-based LCA and input-output analysis. Lu et al. [32] calculated life cycle GHG emissions of coal-biomass gasification systems in China.",

Meanwhile, a whole-system analysis of the BECCS value chain concludes that BECCS is a reliable option for permanent CO 2 removal [34] . Some studies have analyzed the deployment potential of BECCS related to individual bioenergy carriers [35] [36] [37] [38] . In China, Pang et al.

The aim of this study has therefore been to trace changes in the potential of all possible domestic biomass resources on a provincial level and to investigate their uncertainty range. On top of that, it is estimated for the first time the GHG mitigation potential of bioenergy utilization in China by mid-century, with special attention on BECCS. The steps of the assessment are as follows. First, based on the statistical data, we provide the spatial-temporal changes of domestic biomass resources, including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge, and draw the evolution trajectories during the period 2000-2016. Then, the energy potential of total biomass resources (including EC) in 2016 is elaborated to assess the bioenergy production of twelve representative feedstock-tofinal conversion pathways from 2020 to 2050. Furthermore, scenario analysis and LCA are applied to calculate GHG emissions reduction of Bioenergy with and without CCS to displace fossil fuels. Finally, we conduct the uncertainty analysis of bioenergy potential using the Monte Carlo simulation. These outcomes could provide decision-makers with the geographically targeted information on the exploitation of China's bioenergy resources for the mitigation of global climate change.",

AM and SS could only be converted into biogas by anaerobic digestion. Power generation from waste incineration and sanitary landfills management are considered to be two ways for MSW treatment. Given the vigorous forecasted development of waste incineration power plants in the future, we assume that up to 50% and 80% of the disposed quantity of harmless MSW are used in incineration power production during the period 2020-2030 and 2040-2050, respectively [50] .

Protection and special-use forests for environmental services are aimed at maintain biological diversity or natural resources [58, 59] . Along with the expansion of protection forest's area, the proportion of their collectable potential increased from 16.1% in 2000 to 24.2% in 2016.

Excrement from cows, chickens, sheep and pigs made up the bulk of AM, and the collectable potential accounted for 25%, 28%, 17% and 15% of the total in 2016, respectively. Chickens' manure was the fastest-growing resource among these eight kinds. It is worth noting that, since China is the most populous country in the world, humans' excretion may be a promising resource. The collectable potential of that contributed to12.5% of the total AM in 2016. Table 5 shows the variation of the MSW potential from 2000 to 2016. According to the national data [47] , Chinese urbanization level rose from 29% to 57% during the period 1995-2016. With the accelerating urbanization and economic growth, the amount of MSW experienced a substantial increase in recent years. Meanwhile, the rate of harmless disposal increased to 96.6% in 2016 due to the improvement of MSW disposal in waste management options [63] .

In China, domestic sewage is a major source of wastewater. Wastewater discharge is growing with rapid urbanization and industrialization. Yet, COD emissions caused by the organic matter of wastewater, generally embody the energy potential of SS [20] . Evidently, the collectable potential of SS stepped into a peak at 35 EJ in 2011. The main reason is the expansion of the urban population and the widespread use of agricultural fertilizers. Since 2015, there has been a transition in wastewater treatment plants and wastewater pollution management [65] . Thus, SS potential dropped sharply to 0.15 EJ in 2016, which was even lower than the potential in 2000. Fig. 4 depicts the structure of China's provincial biomass resources (except EC) in the period concerned, ranked based on the collectable potential in 2000. The collectable potential of the sub-types CR, FR and AM classified on a provincial level can be found in Supplementary material Section E. Shandong, Henan, Sichuan and Heilongjiang were the top four provinces during the study period, whose collectable biomass resources potential accounted for around 27% of national potential. Heilongjiang took Sichuan's place in 2016 (1491.18 PJ), mainly owing to the rapid increase of CR potential. Furthermore, the collectable potential of biomass resources in Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningxia, Beijing and Hainan was relatively low (<150 PJ). On the other hand, the bioenergy potential of each province was dominated by CR, FR and AM resources. CR in the northeast and central regions was rich. FR was clustered in southwest China. AM was the most evenly distributed of five biomass resources.",

The collective share of bioenergy potential in these four regions declined from 5.4% in 2000 to 4.1% in 2016. For the Tibet autonomous region, the reason was the reduction of FR resource. Its shrubs gradually disappeared and the ecological environment had a moderate degradation in recent years [66] . While for highly developed cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, CR and AM resources potentials presented a significant drop. According to the realistic positioning of these two cities, the proportion of the primary industry in the gross domestic product (GDP) decreases, while the proportion of the tertiary industry increases [67] . So the crops cultivation and livestock breeding reduced and MSW continued to rise. This situation was also similar to the declining bioenergy potential of Zhejiang province, even though its decline was slower. In terms of the increasing trends, northern China had a higher annual growth rate of bioenergy potential than southern China. Liaoning province had the biggest annual growth rate because it first launched the \"Pig-biogas-crop-fruit\" recycling biomass to achieve gas production and fertilizer products used in agriculture and breeding [68] .",

For bioenergy conversion technology, scenario 1 and scenario 3 are the biomass feedstock-to-final conversion pathways without CCS, scenario 2 and scenario 4 assume that all the technological pathways are coupled with CCS to minimize GHG emissions. Fig. 6 illustrates the contribution of each bioenergy carrier to the GHG mitigation potentials from 2020 to 2050. Bio-liquid fuels have the greatest prospect on the GHG emissions reduction among four considered bioenergy carriers. Their proportion in scenario 4 would significantly increase from 7.58% in 2020 to 43.95% in 2050. As transportation fuels, biofuels have a great performance on reducing fossil energy consumption and carbon emissions in the transport sector, especially bio-diesel as an alternative to conventional diesel [89] . With the extensive application of biomass liquid fuels, their more sustainable problems such as biodiversity and ecosystem services have attracted more attention.

Based on this, we calculated the total cumulative GHG mitigation potentials of China's bioenergy sector during that period, which would be in the range of 1652.73-5859.56 Mt CO 2 e.",

The provinces with larger bioenergy potential (e.g., Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia) would have higher associated GHG mitigation potentials. However, from the perspective of scenario analysis, the geographic distribution of cumulative GHG emission reduction potentials varies greatly from scenario to scenario. There are no provinces with bioenergy GHG emissions mitigation higher than 150 Mt CO 2 e in scenario 1, but there are two, thirteen and twenty provinces in scenario 2, scenario 3 and scenario 4, respectively. Certainly, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Hainan and Ningxia would have a relatively low degree of cumulative GHG mitigation potentials in all four scenarios (<50 Mt CO 2 e). In this case, the bioenergy potential of three provincial-level cities (i.e. Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai) should be developed according to local conditions. Given the big availability of MSW, it should be a high priority for these cities to use MSW as the resource for BECCS technology. For the provinces with great GHG mitigation potential, the government should increase the investment to advance cleaner utilization of bioenergy and the large-scale deployment of BECCS.",

RPR and daily excretion coefficient are assumed to fit the log-normal distribution curve with a confidence degree of 95% [98] . Monte Carlo model then runs 5000 times to get the statistical distribution results of RPR and excretion parameters (for details see section A of Supplementary material), whose ranges are summarized by box-and-whisker plots (Fig. 9 ). In terms of RPR, cotton exhibited the highest interquartile range, which denoted the largest variability of cotton among CR. The values of cotton RPR are scattered due to the influence of the different growing environment. Following this, the uncertainty of corn RPR ranked the second, however, it was the main source of the uncertainty of CR since corn had the highest energy potential. For the uncertainty of AM, the excretion coefficient of the cow was the major contributor to uncertainty, owing to its highest interquartile range as well as the dominant role of cow manure in AM.

Compared to the evaluations based on the average values, the uncertainty analysis provides policy-makers with more information to optimize the future planning of bioenergy. Given the higher resources uncertainties of cotton, corn and cow, more field tests and on-site investigations for them should be conducted to improve statistics further. Also, more attention should be paid to the provinces rich in these three resources (e.g. Heilongjiang, Henan and Sinkiang) to formulate subnational bioenergy policy. The efforts to reduce uncertainties will help to prioritize the development of the bioenergy industry more reasonably. ",

The collectable potentials of biomass resources estimated in other existing studies are quite different from that in this study throughout the accounting period. This difference is attributed to the diverse types of biomass resources and to the inconsistent values of their produced coefficients. To systematically evaluate the bioenergy potential in China, this study considered all kinds of possible biomass resources and their produced coefficients, which are average values from existing literature (Section 2.1). Liu et al. [44] did not assess the collectable potential of SS and used smaller RPR of CR and daily excretion coefficient of AM, which led to a significant difference compared to this study. Yang et al. [20] used less classifications for FR and adopted larger coefficients, resulting in the FR potential alone being 29% higher than that of this evaluation in 2007. The estimate in 2008 by Zhou et al. [21] was lower than that of this study, mainly due to the fact that AM and SS were not included in their assessment. Because of the smallest difference of produced coefficients, the biomass resources potential estimated by Zhang [40] is only 2% lower than that of this study, and this small gap is mainly due to the fact that Zhang [40] did not include in the study human faeces. However, these four estimates are within the uncertainty range examined by the Monte Carlo model of the current study, which indicates that all the assessments are acceptable for strategy policies.",

Future work will concentrate on these limitations to provide a more precise evaluation of China's bioenergy potential and GHG mitigation potentials. First, the data sources of the statistical method is responsible for part of the uncertainty of in results. In section 5.1, the uncertainty analysis of the resource potential that arises from produced coefficients acknowledged (   Fig. 9 . Ranges of residue to product ratio (RPR) and animal excretion coefficient for each sub-type of crop residues (a) and animal manure (b). (Diamonds and centre lines represent mean values and 50th percentile, respectively. Boxes represent 25th to 75th percentiles, and bars represent 5th to 95th percentiles of 5000 Monte Carlo simulations). this limitation and attempted to shed light on our assessment more accurately. Certainly, there are other uncertainties that are small and difficult to quantify, especially the EC potential. Due to data accessibility of the actual yield of EC on marginal land, we only assessed the potential of biomass resources including EC in 2016. In the future, to provide more reliable data to policy makers it is advisable to encourage experiments in the cultivation of various EC on marginal land. Meanwhile, future study will try to combine GIS system and land suitability assessment to calculate the time-series potential of EC. Second, we used the national unified planning of bioenergy exploitation to predict associated GHG emissions mitigation, without considering the scales of bioenergy utilization in different provinces. In the future, the distribution characteristics of biomass resources should be taken into account to select more targeted bioenergy conversion pathways. Further studies will specify related policies on a provincial level to achieve more precise assessment on GHG mitigation potentials. Third, the scope of this study was limited in terms of the ecological impacts of large-scale exploitation of bioenergy. This is an important issue for sustainable development of renewable energy sources. It is recommended that further works explore the potential impacts of large-scale bioenergy exploitation, and the relevant research experience developed for hydropower can offer significant background in this regard [5] [6] [7] .",

The increment trend of CR had recovered since 2004 and its collectable potential reached 10.39 EJ in 2016. Owing to the rising feed prices, AM showed an abrupt plunge in 2007 (5.64 EJ), especially the cows and pigs manures. Afterwards, AM potential fluctuated between 5.78 EJ in 2008 and 6.27 EJ in 2016. In addition, FR exhibited a steady growth period from 2000, reaching the pinnacle at 5.08 EJ in 2013. It is reported that China leads in forest area increment around the world. Thanks to the forest conservation and expansion, China was responsible for 25% of the global net increase in leaf area from 2000 to 2017 [52].",
