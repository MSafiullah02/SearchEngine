Glycyrrhizic acid, a primary active ingredient of liquorice roots, has been widely used for antitussive, anti-inflammatory, antiviral emollient and gastro-protective properties (2). It is reported that glycyrrhizic acid has been used to treat patients with chronic active hepatitis (3), fight against the human immunodeficiency virus (4) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes coronavirus (5). Recently, it has been reported that glycyrrhizic acid can ameliorate the intracerebral hemorrhage-induced injury (6, 7) and liver injury (8) induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats. Glycyrrhizic acid can also be used to inhibit side effects of contraceptive formulations, such as alterations in blood coagulation and thrombosis (9).",

Among the extraction techniques, molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) is an efficient approach for purification of analytes from complex matrices (15) and it has been used in environmental, food (16) and life science fields (17) because of the easy preparation and excellent recognition properties of MIPs for analytes. Hydrogen bonding, the main effect between MIPs and template molecules, was easily destroyed in aqueous media because aqueous solvents can compete with the template for the functional monomers (18). And a paper has reported that preparation of glycyrrhizic acid MIPs using Methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomers could not avoid the influence of aqueous solvents (19). Recently, \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) and its derivatives have been chosen as functional monomers for making MIPs due to the internal hydrophobic external hydrophilic properties (20). It is reported that the synthesized MIPs were successfully used to separate some biological compounds, such as cholesterol (21, 22), antibiotics (23), peptides (24) and other compounds in aqueous solution (25).",

In the pre-polymerization mixture for synthesis MIPs, when BMA-\u03b2-CD was mixed with glycyrrhizic acid in DMSO, the aromatic rings of glycyrrhizic acid entrapped inside the hydrophobic core of BMA-\u03b2-CD and the more polar carboxyl group (-COOH) of glycyrrhizic acid left outside the cavity. When MAA was added, the carboxyl group can form hydrogen interactions with MAA. Thus, the BMA-\u03b2-CD molecule and MAA molecule were regularly placed. The positions and mutual conformations of BMA-\u03b2-CD molecule and MAA molecule were fixed by cross-linking procedure.",

While under the same conditions, the adsorbed amount of NIPs increased slowly and the amount of glycyrrhizic acid bound to MIPs was much higher than that of NIPs. It should be noted that the maximum adsorption capacity was 69.3 mg\u00b7g\u22121, which was much higher than the reported method (7). Adsorption studies indicated that the binding sites of the MIPs prepared were at the surface or in the proximity of the surface. So it is an easy diffusion for target to access the recognition sites. This merit is especially favorable for SPE. The results showed that the polymers had better absorption performance for glycyrrhizic acid, which illustrated the good specificity of MIPs.",
