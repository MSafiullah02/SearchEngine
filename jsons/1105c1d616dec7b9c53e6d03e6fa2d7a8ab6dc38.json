            "text": "Microbiome-host interactions play significant roles in health and in various diseases including autoimmune disorders. Uncovering these inter-kingdom cross-talks propels our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and provides useful leads on potential therapeutic targets. Despite the biological significance of microbe-host interactions, there is a big gap in understanding the downstream effects of these interactions on host processes. Computational methods are expected to fill this gap by generating, integrating and prioritizing predictions -as experimental detection remains challenging due to feasibility issues. Here, we present MicrobioLink, a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins together with host molecular networks. Using the concept of network diffusion, MicrobioLink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression. We demonstrated the applicability of the pipeline using a case study. We used gut metaproteomic data from Crohn's disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis. MicrobioLink, which is agnostic of the microbial protein sources (bacterial, viral etc), is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/HMIpipeline).",

In many ecosystems, the microbiome plays an important role as manifested by its dynamic interactions with different hosts [3] . The community of microorganisms are almost indispensable to human life since they modulate and influence immunity and nutrient acquisition. For example, the gastrointestinal microbiome plays a crucial role in nutrient assimilation and energy yield by actively participating in metabolic pathways [4] . Dysbiosis (compositional alterations) of gut microbial communities is associated with diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Studying microbiome-host interactions and its influence on host biological mechanisms is important for monitoring health and disease and also for discovering/fine-tuning therapeutic interventions. Such interactions are mediated by the interplay between various molecular components expressed by the host and the microbiome. For example, bacterial molecules such as metabolites [8] , proteins [9] [10] [11] [12] and small RNAs [13] , can interact with host molecules, and through host intracellular pathways and regulatory networks, modulate the expression of genes in various biological processes [14] [15] [16] , thus maintaining healthy states or transition to diseased states. Besides the metabolite mediated interactions, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are one of the most relevant types of molecular interplay between microbes and host organisms [12] . Experimental techniques to test inter-species PPIs are time consuming and have limitations imposed by cost [1, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Hence, there is a dearth of validated inter-species PPIs in publicly available databases, and these are mostly limited to pathogens. However, using predicted microbe-host PPIs, it is possible to build interaction networks to better understand the cross-talk between the microbial and host proteins, and how these interactions interfere with host metabolism and physiology [22] . Recent studies have also shown how protein-protein interactions between emerging pathogens such as COVID-19 and the host have enabled the discovery of potential drug candidates for clinical testing and validation [23] .",

In order to demonstrate the applicability of MicrobioLink, we performed a case study investigating how the gut microbiome potentially modulates autophagy genes in Crohn's disease (CD).

As for the host proteins, the list is compiled based on their localization: the chosen proteins must be located in a cellular compartment which is physically accessible to the bacterial proteins. Localization based filtering can be applied also to bacterial proteins depending on the context (based on whether the microbe is extracellular or intracellular within the host). In the case of extracellular microbes, the provided host proteins must be present at the extracellular matrix or plasma membrane since these locations are more prone to interacting with extracellular, secreted or membrane bound bacterial proteins. In the case of intracellular microbes, the provided host proteins must be located inside the host cell, as in the cytoplasm for example. These host proteins provided by the user can be derived either from experimental data or publicly available datasets (including but not limited to ProteomicsDB [34] , ComPPI [35] , Human Protein Atlas (HPA) [36] and MatrixDB [37] ).

In parallel, as potential target genes affected by the microbial proteins, we focused on autophagy genes given that autophagy is known to be a dysregulated process in CD [53] [54] [55] 59, 60] . In total we selected 38 autophagy genes, encoding the core components of the autophagy machinery [61] . To detect the most relevant target autophagy genes for CD, we used three different transcriptomic datasets (GSE9686 [62] , GSE36807 [63] and GSE75214 [64] from GEO [65] ), that contained the gene expression profiles of CD patients and healthy individuals, to select the most differentially expressed core autophagy genes. From the above mentioned profiles, we selected autophagy genes which were modulated with coherent trends in at least two datasets. Based on this criteria, we obtained five target autophagy genes namely WIPI1, MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B, ATG7 and ATG4D (Supplementary table 5) .",

Based on these results, we were able to infer that two of the five target autophagy genes could be potentially modulated by the microbial proteins. We also observed a group of host proteins that are connected to microbial proteins occurring in both CD patients and healthy subjects. To retain specificity, we excluded the chains initiated from microbial proteins enriched in both conditions. As a result, we obtained a network with clearly separated signalling paths exclusive to the disease and healthy contexts as shown in Figure 2B . In a final filtering step, we retained only those chains where the last interaction is a TRI to capture the transcriptional regulatory effect of the expression of the target genes. Post this final filtering step, we were able to obtain a final model, as depicted in Figure 2C . Figure 2: (A) . Graphical representation of the signaling paths between curated receptor proteins (host proteins predicted to be modulated by microbial proteins) and target autophagy genes. The network compilation was performed by tracing the signaling chains from the human receptors (predicted to interact with the bacterial proteins) to the autophagy genes using the TieDIE tool which adopts a network diffusion [51] . For brevity, only the results corresponding to the domain-motif interaction analysis are discussed in the case study. (B) .

Over-represented feature sets (Figure 3, Supplementary table 7) included apoptosis, which is known to be upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in IBD patients leading to increased epithelial barrier permeability [66] . Apoptosis has a peculiar interplay with autophagy, in that it is usually up-regulated when autophagy is deactivated and vice versa [67] . In our final model, we also discovered several signaling chains among host networks specific to the healthy condition. These signalling chains included proteins such as SUMO1, PARP1 and E2F1. SUMO1, known to induce autophagy levels [68] , also activates PARP1 and subsequently E2F1, proteins which are both known to stimulate autophagy and inhibit apoptosis [69, 70] . This allowed us to propose the hypothesis that the metaproteome-derived bacterial protein CLST058361 which was expressed in healthy subjects and not in CD patients, could be a key protein involved in stimulating autophagy and decreasing apoptosis. Interestingly, CLST058361 belongs to a family of trypsin-like serine proteases whose Meanwhile, a signalling chain specific to the CD condition included MAPK3 and FOXO3, which are key proteins for apoptosis activation and apoptosis-autophagy interplay [67, 74] . This pathway was modulated by the bacterial protein labeled as CLST14522 (and containing a FOG:_FHA_domain) and uniquely found in CD patients. Other biological processes over-represented in CD networks included those related to cellular differentiation and proliferation, response and generation of oxidative stress, mitochondria related processes, homeostasis and immune system regulation. More comprehensive studies are warranted to ascertain the role of these processes in how the bacterial proteins modulate autophagy in CD (Figure 3) .",

Previous research has shown that host autophagy, while being implicated in the pathogenesis of CD, was primarily dysregulated by defects caused by genetic mutations [53] [54] [55] [56, 57] . MicrobioLink reveals the possibility that autophagy can be modulated by the microbial community through signal transduction propagated via host molecular networks. Although experimental validation is required to ascertain this putative mechanism, we demonstrate the applicability of MicrobioLink to integrate heterogeneous datasets and generate testable hypotheses about microbe-host interactions.",

Other limitations that MicrobioLink helps overcome include the possibility for the user to customize the pipeline depending on his/her organism or community of interest as long as the focus of the microbial-host molecular interface are protein-protein interactions. Due to the mechanism driven approach of MicrobioLink, it provides the users with experimentally testable hypotheses.",

Therefore, to perform an analysis where the microorganism-host interaction is unknown and to study its influence on host processes, the researcher would have to combine different and incompatible tools. In Table 1 , we benchmarked some of the key resources, and compared them with the functions of MicrobioLink. With MicrobioLink, it is possible to perform functional microbiome-host analysis without previous knowledge about its interactions for any microorganism and host species as long as the corresponding annotated proteomes/genomes are available. The user can provide a protein dataset as input from a single species (proteome) or from an entire microbial community (metaproteome). These microorganisms can be bacteria, archaea, viruses or fungi, which makes MicrobioLink applicable for any type of microorganism. Subsequently, the user can select a dataset that represents the resulting host phenotype. It is possible to choose any dataset adequate for the study, such as differentially expressed genes from transcriptomic measurements or protein expression from proteomics. The host data can also correspond to any host, and hence MicrobioLink can be applied for studying the influence of the microbiome on plants, mammals or even fungi. in such disorders and thereby point out key microbial inferences, cellular pathways transmitting normal microbial signals affected in these disorders, and potential targets for further therapeutic interventions.",

Moreover, beneficial effects can also be studied with MicrobioLink. In humans, it can be applied to demonstrate how probiotic species maintain health and homeostasis. In livestock and poultry, it can be used to study how the microbiome can influence productivity[78]. In plants, MicrobioLink can be used to analyse how the commensal microbiome in the soil influences plant health and disease[79]. Eventhough experimental validation of the inferences from the pipeline is out of the scope of this work, we previously demonstrated[12] the validity of the computational inference of microbe-host protein protein interactions and their downstream effects by in vitro verification. As a next step towards improving the pipeline, we are planning to establish use cases in different domains of biological research (including aiding generation of hypotheses for experiments) wherein the microbiome plays a crucial role in the phenotypes of different hosts such as plants as well as mammalian host species. In particular, MicrobioLink will be very useful in studying the role of the microbiome in autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. With MicrobioLink, we could infer the microbiome-mediated mechanisms",
