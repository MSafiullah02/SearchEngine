Furthermore, several escape mutants, representing antigenic variants, have been selected for their resistance to different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), suggesting the occurrence of severe structural constraints in the HAV capsid that prevent the more extensive substitutions necessary for the emergence of a new serotype (Nainan et al., 1992, Ping and Lemon, 1992).",

Moreover, recent studies suggest that fine-tuning translation kinetics selection is also underlying codon usage bias in this specific genome region (Aragones et al., 2010). These results reveal that codon usage plays a key role in HAV replication and evolution. However, our knowledge of other factors also contributing to shaping synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide composition in human HAV in vivo is rather scarce.",

            "text": "In order to investigate the extent of codon usage bias in HAV, we first aligned the complete ORF code sequences from the HAV strains, using the MUSCLE program (Edgar, 2004). Once aligned, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of each codon were determined in order to measure the synonymous codon usage (Sharp and Li, 1986b). This was done using the CodonW program (available at: http://mobyle.pasteur.fr). The RSCU is the observed frequency of a codon divided by the frequency expected, if all synonymous codons for that amino acid were used equally. If RSCU value is close to 1.0, it indicates a lack of bias (Tsai et al., 2007). RSCU values are largely independent of amino acid composition and are particularly useful in comparing codon usage between genes that differ in size and amino acid composition. The RSCU of HAV ORFs were compared with corresponding values of human cells (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001). The effective number of codons (ENC) and the frequency of use of GC3S (G+C at synonymous variable third position codons, excluding Met, Trp, and termination codons) were also calculated by the use of the Codon W program. ENC was used to quantify the codon usage bias of an ORF (Wrigth, 1990), which is one of the best overall estimator of absolute synonymous codon usage bias (Comeron and Aguade, 1998). The ENC values range from 20 to 61. The larger the extent of codon bias in a gene, the smaller the ENC value is. In an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid, this value would be 20; in an unbiased gene, it would be 61. Similarly, the fraction of the G+C nucleotides not involved in the GC3S fraction (GC12) was also calculated. All these indices were also calculated using the Codon W program. The relative frequencies of dinucleotides were also calculated using this program as implemented in the Mobile server (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr).",

This is in agreement with previous results found for the capsid structural region of HAV (Sanchez et al., 2003). In other members of the family Picornaviridae, like Poliovirus or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) the codon usage is very similar to that of their hosts, implying competence for tRNAs among virus and host (Sanchez et al., 2003). In these cases, competition is avoided by the induction of cellular shutoff of protein synthesis through carboxy cleavage of translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) by 2A and L proteases, respectively (Racaniello, 2001). HAV lacks mechanisms of inducing cellular shutoff and needs an intact eIF4G factor for the initiation of translation (Racaniello, 2001, Ali et al., 2001). Moreover, HAV has a very inefficient IRES (Whetter et al., 1994). For these reasons, HAV may be able to synthesize its proteins by adapting their codon usage to those less commonly used cellular tRNAs. This may also account for its low replicative rate (Pinto et al., 2007, Moratorio et al., 2007).",

Nevertheless, as previously suggested for other viral systems, when significant distance among expected and actual ENC values are found, other factors additional to mutational bias may be also contributing to codon usage bias (Shackelton et al., 2006). This is in agreement with very recent studies on HAV populations adapted to propagate in cells with impaired protein synthesis in which fine-tuning translation kinetics selection rather than translation selection was identified as the underlying mechanism of codon usage bias in the capsid coding region (Aragones et al., 2010).

Since species with a close genetic relationship always present a similar codon usage pattern (Sharp et al., 1988), these findings suggest that codon usage in HAV is undergoing also an evolutionary process, probably reflecting a dynamic process of mutation and selection to re-adapt its codon usage to different environments (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material 3).",

The high correlation found between the first axis of COA and the relative dinucleotide abundances (Table 4) suggests that codon usage in HAV ORFs can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequencies. All CpG containing codons are markedly suppressed (Table 3) in the 30 HAV strains included in the study, confirming what has been very recently noted (Bosch et al., 2010). Marked CpG deficiency has been also observed in Coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2007), vertebrate-infecting members of the family Flaviviridae (Lobo et al., 2009), Poliovirus (Rothberg and Wimmer, 1981) and other RNA viruses (Karlin et al., 1994). Moreover, polioviruses synthetically deoptimized either by codon deoptimization or codon pair deoptimization are generally marked by a higher content of CpG (and also UpA) dinucleotide (Burns et al., 2006, Burns et al., 2009, Mueller et al., 2006, Coleman et al., 2008), indicating that polioviruses have naturally evolved to eliminate these dinucleotides. CpG deficiency was proposed to be related to the immunostimulatory properties of unmethylated CpG, which were recognized by the host's innate immune system as a pathogen signature (Shackelton et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2007). Escaping from the host antiviral response may act as another selective pressure contributing to the multifactorial codon usage shaping (Vetsigian and Goldenfeld, 2009).",
