Using in situ hybridization (ISH), To et al demonstrated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in pneumocytes and in the surface enterocytes of the small intestine. Their findings are compatible with those of another study conducted in Taiwan [2] . This observation indicates the cellular tropism of the infectious agent and thus has an impact on our understanding of the disease. Supplementing their findings, we report here our recent study, which suggests that the SARS-CoV may not be exclusively located in pneumocytes, but also in pulmonary macrophages.",

The full-length spike protein (S) cDNA, membrane protein (M) cDNA, and nucleoprotein (N) cDNA clones were kindly provided by the National Research Program for Genomic Medicine and the Genome Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan. These inserts were amplified by PCR and labelled with digoxigenin using the DIG-High Prime kit (Roche, Germany). The tissue sections were hybridized with the mixed probes (S, M, and N), 3 ng/\u00b5l, at 42 \u2022 C overnight. BCIP/NBT was employed as a chromogen [3] .",

First, the co-existence of viral signals and anthracotic pigment in the same cells indicates that those cells are bona-fide macrophages. Second, we observed that some virus-harbouring cells were in the vascular lumina. It is unlikely that pneumocytes can be seen in vascular spaces even in a lung undergoing an extensively destructive process. Third, the virusharbouring cells were predominantly arranged as single discrete cells interspersed within the parenchyma, a finding also observed in previous reports. We did not identify any adherent virus-positive cells, nor did we discern positive signals in the residual intact pneumocytes attached to the alveolar septa. This feature partly argues for a haematological, rather than an epithelial, origin for the virus-carrying cells.",

They produce a plethora of cytokines that have potent regulatory activities in haematopoiesis, inflammation, and diverse immune reactions. In addition to their involvement in cytokine production, they are actively motile cells that respond to chemotactic stimuli and they can phagocytose particulate material and kill micro-organisms [4] . The mortality of patients with SARS has been attributed to a 'cytokine storm' triggered by the host immune response to SARS-CoV that results in diffuse alveolar damage [5] . Although the underlying mechanism of the 'cytokine storm' has not been clarified, such a hypothesis fits our observation that cells of the histiophagocytic lineage are another carrier of SARS-CoV. The presence of SARS-CoV in these cells may induce catastrophic cytokine release.",

            "text": " Chen and Hsiao make an interesting observation on the pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Although the nature of the cells with positive in-situ signals has not been confirmed by double immunofluorescence-fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in the letter, we agree that the cells represent macrophages. However, these features were not seen in our limited number of autopsy cases [1] . In fact, although such positive signals in macrophages were noted in the one case described in their letter, they were not present in the other cases reported by the authors [2] . Thus, this observation appears to be an uncommon event. Given the phagocytic nature of macrophages, it is not surprising to see macrophages picking up various cellular and viral components in areas of tissue destruction. Nevertheless, there is no convincing evidence that macrophages can be directly infected by SARS-CoV: the virus has not been isolated or cultured from histiocyte/macrophage-rich organs, including spleen and lymph node, and ultrastructural studies have also failed to detect viral particles in macrophages [3] [4] [5] . Furthermore, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the newly identified functional receptor for SARS-CoV, is not known to be expressed by macrophages. However, as we suggested, aberrant immune responses contribute significantly to the pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations of",
