It emerged as a potentially fatal and highly contagious viral disease in 1978 (Appel et al. 1979). Few years after its emergence, CPV\u20102 was completely replaced by two antigenic variants designated as CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b which is now distributed worldwide (Parrish et al. 1988). In 2001, a novel CPV mutant with an amino acid substitution at position 426 (Asp \u2192 Glu), called CPV\u20102c, emerged in Italy (Buonavoglia et al. 2001). Currently, CPV\u20102c is broadly distributed and co\u2010exists with CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b types in Europe, Australia, North and South American countries (Decaro et al. 2007; Spibey et al. 2008). Similarly, CPV types 2a/2b, having mutation at residue 297 (Ser\u2192Ala) and designated as New CPV\u20102a/2b, have been reported from various countries including India in recent times (Ohshima et al. 2008; Mohanraj et al. 2010). In Puducherry, southern India, 16 CPV\u20102a variants (297 Ser \u2192Ala) termed as \u2018new CPV\u20102a\u2019 were detected among vaccinated and unvaccinated dog population (Mohanraj et al. 2010). Recently, 24 new CPV\u20102a and two new CPV\u20102b strains were detected among vaccinated and unvaccinated dog populations from 5 different states/union territories in South India (Vivek 2011).",

Early and rapid diagnosis is necessary so that the infected dogs can be isolated to prevent the spread of the disease and also to administer supportive treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a better detection method would be one that is not only speedy, accurate and sensitive, but also simple and economical for its practical field\u2010based applications.",

However, these assays require 2\u20134 h, special equipments and technical expertise. Therefore, a novel nucleic acid amplification method, termed loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which amplifies specific DNA sequences under isothermal conditions within 60 min, was developed as a simple, rapid, specific and cost\u2010effective alternative (Notomi et al. 2000). Specific amplification can be detected by observing directly the turbidity (Mori et al. 2001), the fluorescence after adding DNA\u2010binding dyes like propidium iodide (Hill et al. 2008) or by the presence of ladder\u2010like multiple bands on 2\u00b70% agarose gel (Parida et al. 2006).",

            "text": "CPV is one of the most dreadful diseases in young pups. Early detection and isolation of the affected animals is one of the most logical strategies to reduce the risk of further transmission. The LAMP assay, developed in this study for direct detection of CPV DNA from suspected faecal samples, could identify CPV within one hour of DNA extraction. The boiling and chilling method for template preparation was as sensitive as the kit method. The boiling and chilling method for template preparation adopted in this study was simple, cost\u2010effective, less labour oriented and less time\u2010consuming when compared to kit method. The boiling and chilling method of DNA extraction is easy to perform and can be readily adopted in clinical laboratories for field diagnosis of CPV infection by LAMP assay. Nemoto et al. (2011) used a similar technique for direct detection of equine herpes virus\u20101 DNA in nasal swabs of horses. In the present study, of the 140 clinical samples tested, 104 (74\u00b728%) and 81 samples (57\u00b785%) were detected positive for CPV by LAMP and PCR assays, respectively. In an earlier study, Cho et al. (2006) reported that of the 50 CPV\u2010suspected faecal samples, 37 (74\u00b70%) were positive by PCR, whereas 40 of 50 faecal samples (80\u00b70%) were found positive by LAMP. Chen et al. (2009) compared the detection rates of porcine parvovirus by PCR (93\u00b76%) and LAMP (97\u00b76%) from 125 clinical samples and reported higher detection rate in LAMP. Decaro et al. (2005) developed a rapid and sensitive real\u2010time PCR assay for detecting and quantifying CPV\u20102 DNA in the faeces of dogs with diarrhoea. However, use of real\u2010time PCR assay is limited because of cost of instrumentation, cost of enzyme mixes sold by the machine manufacturers and the cost of reagents especially fluorogenic probe that is more expensive than the regular primers (Curry et al. 2002). JinLong et al. (2010) analysed LAMP and fluorescent quantitative real\u2010time PCR (FQ\u2010PCR) assay for goose parvovirus infected gosling tissues. Twenty one of the 30 samples were tested positive, while nine were negative, based on FQ\u2010PCR and LAMP.",

            "text": "In the present study, significant difference was found between LAMP and conventional PCR assays for direct detection of CPV DNA in faecal samples. Bst polymerase used in LAMP is reported to be more tolerant than Taq polymerase to inhibitors present in biological materials like faecal samples (Monteiro et al. 1997; Bakheit et al. 2008). As a simple and cost\u2010effective boiling and chilling method of template preparation was adopted in this study, it would have probably resulted in inactivation of Taq polymerase by faecal inhibitors in certain cases leading to problems related to sensitivity of PCR assay. Moreover, the size of the amplicon was 630 bp, and a longer amplicon size would have resulted in false negative result in few cases as it has been demonstrated by Tilley (2004) during PCR amplification of wheat sequences from DNA. LAMP was also found to detect more numbers of positive cases than PCR for the identification of toxoplasma DNA (Krasteva et al. 2009), taenid DNA (Nkouawa et al. 2010) and equine rotavirus in faecal specimens (Nemoto et al. 2010) which corroborates with the findings of the present study.",

On the other hand, the conventional PCR assay could detect only up to 1000 TCID50 ml\u22121 of virus (up to 10\u22123 dilution). Therefore, the developed LAMP assay was found to be more sensitive in comparison with conventional PCR assay. Similar higher sensitivity of LAMP over PCR was also reported by Krasteva et al. (2009) and Nemoto et al. (2010), whereas Cho et al. (2006) reported the detection limit of LAMP as 0\u00b71 TCID50 ml\u22121 from CPV\u2010suspected faecal samples. There are several reports of CPV infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs from different parts of India (Chinchkar et al. 2006; Panneer et al. 2008; Mohanraj et al. 2010). Therefore, the development of a simple, rapid, sensitive, cost\u2010effective and specific diagnostic test like loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique, for direct detection of CPV in faecal specimens without the elaborate steps involved in template DNA preparation, would be a real boon to veterinary clinicians in resource\u2010limited veterinary clinics and laboratories for effective control of CPV infections in canines.",
