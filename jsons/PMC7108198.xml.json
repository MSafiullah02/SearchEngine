However, clinical trials of presatovir conducted in multiple different patient populations, including this study and a companion URTI study (Chemaly et al [24], this issue), indicate difficulties remain in translating challenge study results to successful clinical trials in patients with natural infection [25, 26]. One partial explanation is the challenge model\u2019s inconsistent representation of the natural infection setting. Challenge study volunteers were inoculated intranasally with RSV, then monitored for nasal RSV replication with twice-daily nasal washes that were immediately evaluated with molecular assays for RSV [16, 22, 23]. Antiviral treatment was initiated 6\u201324 hours after RSV detection, generally several days before peak viral load and prior to manifestation of significant clinical signs and symptoms [16, 22, 23]. In the present study, patients with naturally acquired RSV LRTI received presatovir later in the disease course compared with challenge study subjects (median [range], 5 [1\u201326] days after symptom onset); delay was also observed in the URTI trial (median [range], 4 [1\u201310] days) and other studies of presatovir in natural RSV infection [25, 26]. Because clinical signs and symptoms tend to correlate with nasal viral load [16, 22], these patients presumably presented near or more likely after peak nasal viral load, potentially beyond the therapeutic window for presatovir even in immunocompromised patients. Host immune-mediated clearance of the virus at this stage may also mask treatment-induced reduction in viral load. Thus, treatment delay may explain lack of presatovir efficacy in the current study.",

Because RSV is capable of cell-to-cell spread, inhibition of viral fusion may not halt propagation of established infection along the respiratory tract. Therefore, fusion inhibitors, such as presatovir, may need to be administered, whereas virus-cell fusion still represents the main mode of viral spread to appreciably reduce nasal viral load. Emergence of F gene protein amino acid substitutions associated with fusion inhibitor resistance was also relatively frequent (21%) in this immunocompromised population. Polymerase inhibitors can terminate intracellular RSV replication and may have wider therapeutic windows compared with fusion inhibitors [27]. However, no polymerase inhibitor has demonstrated clinical efficacy in a natural infection setting to date. Furthermore, nasal viral load is questionable as a primary endpoint for proof-of-concept studies in naturally infected patients with LRTI because upper respiratory tract samples, although more convenient to obtain, may not reflect viral activity in the lower respiratory tract, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Alternative approaches are needed for noninvasive measurement of viral disease dynamics and antiviral activity in lower airway and alveolar tissue.",

As RSV chiefly affects airway epithelium [28], RSV LRTI could manifest without radiographic findings, and present only as lower airway symptoms (eg, wheezing or obstructive spirometry pattern).

Furthermore, lymphopenia is a major risk factor for RSV infection and subsequent poor outcomes in HCT recipients [2, 4, 29], but only 4/47 patients with available data in the current study were lymphopenic (<200 cells/mm3) at baseline, possibly because RSV infection occurred relatively late after HCT (median, 485 vs 129 days in the Waghmare study). These differences could be due to limited enrollment of patients perceived as fragile because of the requirement for lower respiratory sampling to confirm RSV LRTI. Enrichment of the study population for immunosuppressed patients should be considered in future clinical trials of therapies for RSV infection in HCT recipients.",

The tendency of adults with naturally acquired RSV infection to seek treatment only after several days of symptoms, when the treatment window may have closed for fusion inhibitors in particular, is a challenge for clinical trials of RSV-specific antiviral therapies. The numerically lower rate of pulmonary complications in the presatovir URTI trial suggests that early treatment, before LRTI develops, is key for success in future studies.",
