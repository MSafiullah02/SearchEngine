            "text": "Virus\u2010like particles (VLPs), formed by the structural elements of viruses, have received considerable attention over the past two decades. The number of reports on newly obtained VLPs has grown proportionally with the systems developed for the expression of these particles. When expressed in a suitable heterologous system, viral structural proteins involved in capsid or envelope formation often self\u2010assemble into VLPs in the absence of other viral components usually required for virus assembly, such as multiple structural or nonstructural proteins and viral genomes. Protein\u2013protein interactions in VLPs are relatively strong and can result in the formation of stable structures. Several experiments have been reported that may help answer questions regarding the requirements for VLP formation. Knowledge on the assembly process of VLPs is crucial to define the usefulness of such particles for the presentation of their own or foreign epitopes as carriers for transiently expressed proteins as a means of vaccine production. The aim of the present chapter is to outline recent achievements in two important fields of research brought about by the availability of VLPs produced in a foreign host. These are (1) the requirements for VLP assembly and (2) the use of VLPs as carriers for foreign epitopes. To date, reviews in these areas have mainly focused on results obtained with a specific virus genus or family of viruses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the reader is advised to refer to these reviews for complementary information.",

To investigate the main driving forces responsible for VLP formation, the assembly of several viral structural proteins was studied.",

            "text": "Norwalk virus (NV; family Caliciviridae) is unique among animal viruses in possessing a single structural capsid protein and, hence, shares the structural simplicity of plant viruses. Expression of the capsid protein (VP1) in heterologous systems results in the formation of empty VLPs (8, 9, 10). A detailed study of the ability of a set of deletion mutants to assemble into VLPs revealed the regions involved in capsid formation. The NV VP1 contains two domains, a shell (S) domain at the N\u2010terminus and a protruding (P) domain at the C\u2010terminus, in which two subdomains (P1, P2) can be distinguished. The S domain alone can initiate VLP assembly whereas the P domain controls the stability and size of the particle when expressed in insect cells (11). Similar results were obtained for the VLPs of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Togaviridae family) expressed in mammalian cells in which mutations ablating VLP assembly are located in the N\u2010terminal and P1 domains (12). For NV VLPs, it was also demonstrated that a minor structural protein VP2 may be encapsidated by the particles when coexpressed in insect cells and cell\u2010free systems (13, 14). This small basic protein increases the expression and stability of VP1, protecting it also from disassembly and protease degradation (15). VP1 of another member of the Caliciviridae family, the Snow Mountain norovirus, expressed by a recombinant baculovirus, also self\u2010assembles into VLPs: assembly analyses of the wild type and mutant VLPs expressing VP1 indicate that a single histidine residue at position 91 (S domain) is crucial for VLP formation (16).",

No significant differences are observed between VLPs composed of any of the four polypeptides.

The structural requirements leading to the formation of VLPs are carried by P3 and P8. Coexpression in transgenic rice plants of P3 and P8, but not expression of P8 alone, results in the formation of double\u2010shelled VLPs similar to native RDV particles. Hence, these two proteins appear sufficient for the structural integrity of the VLPs in plants (22). Double\u2010shelled VLPs were also observed upon coexpression or mixing of P3 and P8 in vitro. The structural protein P7 expressed in a similar manner was located inside the VLPs (23). Expression of the structural protein P3 in insect cells resulted in the formation of single\u2010shelled core\u2010like particles (CLPs). Self\u2010assembly of P3 CLPs is driven by the N terminus of P3, and proteins with serial amino\u2010terminal deletions form particles with gradually decreased stability. After removing the 52 N\u2010terminal residues, CLPs are no longer formed (24).",

Up to 30 amino acids can be deleted from the N\u2010terminus of the CP without hampering assembly. Moreover, addition of 41 amino acid residues to the N\u2010terminus of the wild\u2010type CP does not alter VLP formation. Comparison of the crystal structure of the empty T = 3 VLPs with that of the native T = 3 virus shows that the N\u2010terminus provides the structural dynamism required for virus disassembly (25, 26). In contrast, deletion of one, five, or ten residues from the C\u2010terminus alters VLP formation, and deletion of the C\u2010terminal asparagine residue produces unstable VLPs that disassemble to form discrete intermediates (27, 28). Mutation of crucial interfacial residues identified on the basis of crystal structure of native virus and PhMV VLPs resulted in essentially partially folded monomers, suggesting that subunit folding and assembly are concerted (29). Similarly in Polyomavirus (family Polyomaviridae), truncation of the C terminus of VP1, the major structural protein, results in the formation of pentameric capsomers but not of VLPs, suggesting that the C terminus is involved in specific association of the capsomers (30).",

The scaffolding protein is required for the correct assembly of the outer shell of the capsids. Coexpression of all seven components in insect cells results in the formation of VLPs indistinguishable from native particles. VLP assembly does not take place in the absence of VP23, VP5, or VP19C, whereas lack of VP26 is without effect on VLP formation. Partial and deformed capsid shells are formed in the absence of VP21, VP24, and VP22a (46). The C\u2010terminal 25 amino acids of VP22a are cleaved after assembly or when complexed with one or more capsid shell proteins (47).

VP2 by itself forms CLPs and, in particular, its N\u2010terminus is responsible for binding and encapsidation of VP1 and VP3 (51). A detailed analysis showed that VP2 with any N\u2010terminal truncation between amino acids 1 and 25 fails to bind VP1, yet that VP2 lacking the first 92 amino acids is still able to form single\u2010 and double\u2010layered VLPs (52). VP2/VP6 interactions are sufficient to form double\u2010layered VLPs, while addition of the other major capsid components VP4 and VP7 leads to the formation of triple\u2010layered particles resembling native rotavirus particles. The Bovine rotavirus VP2 also can serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the other capsid proteins originating from the human virus (50).

VP3 and VP7 are sufficient to form single\u2010shelled CLPs in a baculovirus expression system (56). Deletion, point mutation, and domain switching analyses of the two proteins VP3 and VP7 helped to identify certain sequences that are essential for the formation of CLPs (57). Simultaneous coexpression of all the major structural proteins resulted in the assembly of double\u2010shelled VLPs (58, 59). Identification of regions in the inner scaffold proteins VP3 and VP7, involved in CLP formation (60, 59), has made it possible to assemble VLPs using capsid components from different orbiviruses. The nature of the interactions between the innermost VP3 and the intermediate VP7 layer were studied by analysis of VLP assembly of VP7 single or multiple site mutants of VP7. It was clearly shown that both the position and the nature of single residues are critical for the formation of VLPs with VP3 and VP7 (61).",

It was also demonstrated that the 71 C\u2010terminal amino acids of pVP2 are essential for the establishment of VP2\u2013VP3 interactions (62). A critical role in VLP formation is played by the C\u2010terminal oligomerization domain of the VP3 scaffold protein: a product lacking the 13 C\u2010terminal residues as a result of proteolysis was unable to form VLPs. Prevention from protease activity by coexpression of VP1 which binds to the C terminus of VP3 led to efficient VLP formation (63). The C\u2010terminal residue of VP3, glutamic acid, controls the assembly process. Deletion or replacement of the five terminal amino acids, or fusion with small proteins such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or truncated ovalbumin, as well as deletion of the C\u2010terminal glutamic acid residue promoted VLP formation, suggesting that assembly requires screening of the negative charges at the C terminus of the scaffold protein VP3 (64). The fused polypeptides mimicked the function of VP1, which interacts with VP3 to promote VLP assembly.",

However, attempts to obtain sufficient amounts of VLPs failed in most cases when using the core and envelope (E1 and E2) protein genes in the absence of other viral components that might enhance the assembly process. The first report on structural proteins assembled into VLPs with a bilayer envelope indicated the requirement of at least part of the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the viral genome (69). HCV CLP formation depends on the highly basic N\u2010terminal 120 (70) or 124 (71) amino acids of the core protein and on oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5\u2032 untranslated region that harbors predicted secondary structural elements (71).

Hence, the arginine\u2010rich motif can act as a molecular switch in T = 3 assembly (72). Deletion of the N\u2010terminal 65 amino acid residues resulted in the formation of a T = 1 particle. Comparison of the crystal structure of this T = 1 particle with native SeMV showed that the major structural difference was in the icosahedral dimers (73, 74).

Similarly, the unprocessed Gag precursor (Pr55gag) of Human immunodeficiency retrovirus 1 (HIV\u20101) forms VLPs. Deletion of the C terminus, together with the finger domain of the Gag precursor, abolishes assembly of VLPs, whereas membrane targeting and evagination are still possible (89). Expression of the entire Gag\u2010Pol protein in mammalian cells by way of a Vaccinia virus expression vector leads to the formation of immature and mature retrovirus\u2010like particles budding from the cell surface (90), whereas expression of Gag in yeast cells does not lead to budding unless the yeast cell wall has been removed, forming spheroplasts (91). Unique among retroviruses, transient expression of the Env protein of Simian foamy virus in BHK\u201021 cells leads to efficient budding and formation of VLPs that appear normal in size and morphology. This finding and other similarities align foamy viruses with Hepatitis B virus, despite all the significant structural differences that exist between viruses of these families (92). Rubella virus (family Togaviridae) forms VLPs by a budding mechanism, which involves coordinated expression in mammalian cells of the capsid protein and the two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 (93, 94, 95). Each glycoprotein contains two domains, the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain, required in early and late steps of the assembly pathway, respectively. E2 acts as a support recruiting newly synthesized E1 molecules. The E2 transmembrane domain contains a Golgi retention signal and its cytoplasmic domain is required for interaction with the capsid proteins when VLPs are secreted (96).",

            "text": "Unlike retrovirus requirements for VLP formation, members of the family Coronaviridae assemble their viral envelopes into VLPs independently of the capsid protein. Two factors, the viral membrane glycoprotein (M) and the envelope protein (E), are required for assembly of coronavirus VLPs resembling native virions (97). The E protein occurs in trace amounts in VLPs whereas the M glycoprotein, that spans the membrane bilayer three times, is abundant. Detailed mutation analyses and co\u2010assembly of mutated M protein with assembly\u2010competent (wild\u2010type) M protein demonstrated that transmembrane domains play a crucial role in homotypic interactions between particular M proteins (98, 99). A detailed study of VLP formation driven by the M and E proteins of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; family Coronaviridae) showed that proteins correctly targeted to the Golgi complex require their cytoplasmic tails to assemble into VLPs (100). To study the major driving forces in budding of Influenza virus (family Orthomyxoviridae) VLPs, a number of plasmids expressing the viral structural components in COS\u20101 cells were constructed. Co\u2010transformation experiments, followed by identification of VLPs by biochemical assays, immunoblotting, and electron microscopy, indicated that extracellular membranous spikeless particles similar in size and shape to those of true virions were formed in cell cultures expressing exclusively the viral matrix protein M1. Therefore, the M1 protein has all the structural information required to induce efficient formation of VLPs that bud from the cell membranes (101). Similarly, the human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV\u20101; family Paramyxoviridae) matrix protein M alone, when expressed from a plasmid in mammalian cells, induced budding of VLPs from the plasma membrane. Furthermore, coexpression of the nucleoprotein, which only leads to the formation of intracellular nucleocapsid\u2010like structures, resulted in budding of VLPs enclosing the nucleocapsid\u2010like structures. This observation suggests that the M protein of hPIV\u20101 has the ability to induce the formation of VLPs and to incorporate nucleocapsid\u2010like structures into these vesicles (102).",

The expression of VP40 in the absence of any other Ebola virus protein leads to budding and formation of characteristic filamentous spikeless VLPs. The central role of VP40 in this process is supported by the fact that coexpression of the viral glycoprotein (GP), which is found in pleomorphic particles budding from the plasma membrane when expressed alone, leads to incorporation of the GP into filamentous VLPs (105). Such a mechanism of VP40\u2013GP\u2010membrane interaction seems to be common to all the members of the Filoviridae family.

When overexpressed in bacteria, VP1 forms pentameric capsomers and assembles into VLPs stabilized at low ionic strengths (108). In contrast, when expressed in the cytoplasm of insect cells, VP1 is transported to the nucleus and forms VLPs (109, 110) that may be disrupted into pentameric capsomers by EDTA or DTT (110).

Substitutions of the calcium ion binding residues of SV40 VP1 capsid protein resulted in the formation of tubular particles as well as VLPs with increased stability in the absence of calcium ions, suggesting that appropriate affinities of calcium ion binding are important for assembly of the capsid. Cysteine mutations revealed that the disulfide linkage stabilizes the calcium ions and, hence, the stability of the particles of SV40 (111). Recombinant capsids assembled upon expression of the major structural protein VP1 of JCV form disulfide linkages that stabilize dimeric and trimeric interactions. Such VLPs remained intact even after treatment with DTT, and disassembly occurred only after treatment with EGTA. When the capsids were treated with EGTA without reducing the disulfide bonds, they failed to disassemble, suggesting that the disulfide bonds are important to maintain the capsid structure by protecting the calcium ions from chelation (112). In the icosahedral SeMV, calcium\u2010mediated interactions are proposed to regulate the assembly/disassembly of the virus. The calcium ion is octahedraly coordinated with six ligands, two carboxylates from one subunit, and three other ligands from the neighboring subunits. The sixth ligand is a water molecule. The calcium\u2010binding site is conserved in all the Sobemoviruses. Mutation of the residues involved in the calcium coordination does not affect the assembly of T = 1 VLPs. Further, the crystal structure of mutant T = 1 particles revealed that they indeed lack calcium and are slightly expanded (113). In contrast, mutation of aspartates involved in calcium coordination severely affected the T = 3 VLP assembly (114).",

Coexpression of the minor late 2 (L2) structural protein increases the efficiency of particle formation but is not strictly required. Reduction of intermolecular disulfide bonds by DTT led to disassembly of VLPs into L1 capsomers to which L2 remained associated, indicating that disulfide bond formation could be essential for capsid assembly (116). Further experiments demonstrated that mutation of only two highly conserved cysteine residues in L1 leads to the formation of monomers. It has also been suggested that trimerization of L1 is indispensable for the stabilization of intercapsomeric contacts in papillomavirus VLPs (117). Expression of L1 from two different serotypes resulted in VLPs with covalent disulfide bonds between these two types of proteins. This may provide a new tool to induce antibodies against multiple HPV types (118).",

Two regions of VP2 dispensable for capsid formation, the N terminus which is directed toward the inside of the VLP, and loop 2, which is partially presented on the surface of the capsid, proved suitable sites for foreign epitope insertion in antigen presentation when expressed in insect cells (136, 137, 138, 139). To elucidate events related to CPV infection, fluorescent VLPs were developed. The insertion of the enhanced GFP at the N terminus of VP2 did not alter assembly of the VLPs. Using these chimeric particles, their entry process into mammalian cells was followed and intracellular trafficking was observed (140). Inserting into the N terminus of the PPV VP2, a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope from Lymphocytic choriomenengitis virus (LCMV; family Arenaviridae) produced a readily self\u2010assembling PPV:VLP\u2010LCMV when expressed in insect cells, with a morphology closely related to that of PPV:VLP.

As a consequence, modified structural proteins appropriate for assembly of multipurpose chimeric VLPs can be designed. Our growing knowledge of the rules directing VLP assembly makes it possible to engineer particles composed of fusion proteins carrying viral structural domains and foreign epitopes. It has been shown that such modifications can lead to the formation of VLPs which are highly effective as subunit vaccines and which can mimic the overall structure of virus particles without containing the viral genetic material. The use of VLPs as novel vaccines and immunogens has been widely reviewed (129, 163).",
