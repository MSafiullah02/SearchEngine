Viruses can infect all types of life forms, i.e., animals, plants, microorganisms (Koonin et al., 2006) . There are millions of types of viruses in the environment (Breitbart and Rohwer, 2005) . Among these, human corona viruses (HCoVs) are common in humans causing for around 30% of cases of the common cold (Mahy, 1980; Mesel-Lemoine et al., 2012) . In 1968, coronaviruses were first discovered and named so due to their crown-like bulbous appearance (Latin \"corona\" means crown) in electron micrographs (Nature, 1968 ) as shown in Figure 3 . The ubiquitous pathogens, coronaviruses (CoVs) can be found in vertebrates, i.e., birds, fish, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 amphibians, reptiles, and mammals (Brenda G. Hogue and Machamer, 2008) . They are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (Yin and Wunderink, 2018) , which can infect human and thus cause a variety of diseases, including respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, encephalitis, and hepatitis (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) Usually, CoVs are enveloped, spherical lipid bilayer (approximately 120 nm in diameter), with a prominent fringe of 20-nm-long, petal shaped surface projections (spikes) composed of a heavily glycosylated type I glycoprotein, spike protein (Masters, 2006) . In the structure of CoV, at least three structural (envelope) proteins like membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) are coordinated with a positive-strand RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases (kb) in length (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . Some CoVs have additional envelope proteins like hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and nucleocapsid (N) (Brenda G. Hogue and Machamer, 2008) . The structure of CoV is responsible for its vibrant morphological, biological functions or reproductive modes in different environmental conditions.",

In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe first identified a new group of human CoV-OC43 in the respiratory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 tract of an adult human showing common cold symptoms (Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1966 Groot et al., 2013) . Lastly, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, a member of beta-coronaviruses, has started in China from December, 2019 causing 198 confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20, 2020 (WHO, 2020k). In terms of risk factor, SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from SARS, MERS, and influenza (Yin and Wunderink, 2018) .",

The first discovered place of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported as a wet market named Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020) , where there is a chance of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans. Like SARS, SARS-CoV-2 has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses suggesting its emergence from a bat-borne virus (Benvenuto et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Perlman, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a) . Therefore, the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is bats as recommended by WHO (WHO, 2020r ). In addition, pangolin is assumed to be involved as an intermediate animal reservoir for the transmission of novel virus to humans causing COVID-19 (C, 2020; WHO, 2020k) .",

These all issues have been discussed by Moriyama et al. (Moriyama et al., 2020) , who focused on the linking evidence of outdoor and indoor climates with the seasonality of respiratory viral infections. Therefore, it was suggested that the transmission rate and stability of novel coronavirus (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) can be varied with different environmental parameters, i.e., temperature, humidity, sunlight etc. (Kuiken et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Peiris et al., 2003) . However, there is no strong evidence about decreased transmission rates of SARS- According to World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and WHO, pet dogs, or cats are not reported to be infected by coronavirus. On April 6, 2020, the first infected animal by coronavirus was reported to have been a tiger in New York City's Bronx Zoo of USA, which might be due to transmission of virus from an asymptomatic zookeeper (BBC, 2020c) . This human-to-animal transmission of coronavirus is a matter of warning and could pose a threat to some wildlife like the great apes like wild gorillas, chimps, and orangutans. This issue is still an ongoing study by OIE.",

The alveoli are hollow cup-shaped little cavities found in the lung structure where gas exchange of breathing process takes place. Type II cells are the most numerous cells in the alveoli. Figure 5 depicts the coronavirus infection and replication cycle. The infection may proceed in the following way: (Letko et al., 2020) I. First, the virus particle uses its special surface, glycoprotein (spike) to connect to ACE2 of the lungs and thus enters the host cell ( Figure 5a ). II. The virus particle is then uncoated, and its RNA genome enters the cell The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the COVID-19 disease in that tissue. As the disease progresses, respiratory failure and consequent death may occur (Xu et al., 2020) . ACE2 is also attached to the outer surface of cells in the arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines. As a result, COVID-19 may cause multi-organ failure in extremely severe cases (CDC, 2020d).",

During this incubation period, an organism can be multiplied and reach a threshold limit, which is necessary to produce symptoms in the host (Wikipedia, 2020b) . In order to determine the most likely exposure time for an outbreak of a typical infectious disease, it is very important to know the average as well as range of incubation period (CDC, 2020l). Currently, the incubation period of novel coronavirus is generally J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f between two and fourteen days (Lombardi et al., 2020) , with an average of five days (CDC, 2020k). Lauer et al. (Lauer et al., 2020) estimated the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 for 181 confirmed cases outside Hubei province, China. It was monitored that more than 97 percent of people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were showing symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure whereas the average incubation period was approximately 5 days, which is as similar as SARS. However, longer monitoring periods are suggested to be justified in extreme cases. Therefore, if a person travelled to an ongoing COVID-19 infected area within the previous 14 days, is at high risk and must follow quarantine rules (CDC, 2020c; Jiaye et al., 2020).",

Furthermore, countries with fragile institutions and weak health systems, huge numbers of people could die in the short term, (Maxmen, 2020) including many of the millions of vulnerable people living in unruly and under-resourced refugee camps (Berglof, 2020). One of the most stressful situations is the unpredictability of the situation and the uncertainty of when to control the disease and the seriousness of the risk (Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020 The fastest exchange of scientific knowledge with scientific journals has already been observed in human history due to the current pandemic (Berglof, 2020 ). An effective global strategy must support the effort to develop and distribute a vaccine. For starters like COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination could be the primary preventive measure of the disease (Berglof, 2020). However, there is no guarantee that other novel virus will not emerge in future, for which millions may die before developing respective vaccines (Berglof, 2020; UNDP, 2020a) . Therefore, the use of research-based evidence(Nature, 2020a; Yang and Wang, 2020) and coping with steep learning curves may strengthen the weakest links in an individual hospital, a local community, a country, or the world during this current pandemic (Berglof, 2020) . At the same time, the weak health-care systems must be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 41 shored up for the worst-case scenario. Lastly, fast and large-scale efforts must be designed as well as considered to handle not only the imminent flood of cases but also pandemic recurring and future waves of similar viruses (Berglof, 2020). Because, weaker health education can be as damaging as the virus itself and thereby, improved health education is one of the important tools to fight the unknown pathogens like novel viruses.",

The pandemic is moving like a wave leaving in deaths, damaging immune systems, and weakening economies globally. There is, actually, no way of knowing when all the situation will come back to normal life. Now all the countries are in uncharted territory due to global threat of the current COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome this dark period, a global response as well as solidarity must be an investment in our future in order to support the most vulnerable countries, which cope with this unfolding crisis. Because, from climate change to the next pandemic, global response and solidarity could lay the groundwork for a new, nimbler alliance of multiple countries for handling future challenges. These extra efforts will pay off when the next one strikes. Therefore, it can be assumed that the performance of the current world leaders will be reviewed by the future historians in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. It is time for government of every country to emphasis and invest more on research and development to overcome this pandemic and prevent any future crisis like this. ",

Vaccines for coronaviruses are mostly based on targeting the main antigenic component of the virus, which is S protein. Several strategies have been used that encode the S protein. The most popular strategies are DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, and attenuated recombinant viruses (ClinicalTrials, 2019; M., 2019). Recently, China and Australia have successfully grown 2019-nCoV to help develop new strategies to combat the pathogen (J., 2020).According to the prior studies related to coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, a genetic platform called mRNA-1273 (messenger RNA) was used to develop the investigational vaccine and examined in human on trial basis (NIAID, 2020). However, there has not yet been approved vaccine and anti-viral medications for SARS-CoV-2(Grenfell R, 2020;Spinney, 2020). This may be because it is highly unlikely that a well-matched vaccine will be available when a pandemic begins unless a vaccine with broad cross-protection is developed(CDC, 2007).b. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs):It is important to take speedy and coordinated public health actions as protective measures, which are known as NPIs. The NPIs have been reporting to be applied for reduction of the chance of COVID-19 transmission and infection among high-risk populations(CDC, 2020i;Chen et al., 2020b;Horowitz, 2020;Prem et al., 2020;Shao, 2020). Because the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 23 individual and population-based preventive measures can minimize the burden of diseases and associated risk factors. In addition, if proper NPI-like counter measures are not taken during a pandemic, the healthcare system could be overwhelmed by severe COVID-19 infected cases and thus the situation cannot be handled effectively(CDC, 2020i;Noreen Qualls et al., 2017).",

As shown in Figure 7, if adequate protection is not taken, a fast upswing of COVID-19 infected cases may take place. As a result, the number of infected persons requiring hospitalization may go beyond the capacity of a nation's health-care facilities. On the other hand, protective measures can lower the epidemic peak of COVID-19 cases to the extent possible (CDC, 2007). Therefore, it is highly appreciated to apply protective measures like NPI during this pandemic until the epidemic peak goes down. Different strategies of NPIs for combating COVID-19 are briefly discussed in the following: c. Individual protection Strategies for self-protection include overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, social distancing and avoid travelling (CDC, 2020i). Among all, frequent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 24 hand washing is the most powerful preventive measure for an individual to fight the infectious virus. The recommended time for hand washing alongwith soap and water is at least 20 seconds (CDC, 2020i). When soap and water are not readily available outside, especially in a public place, hand sanitizer is used as an alternative to soap(CDC, 2020i). Because alcoholbased hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can disinfect hands by taking a little amount on hand and rubbing them until getting dry(CDC,   2020i). It is advisable not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene(CDC, 2020i). During the outbreak, one should avoid close contact with people who are sick.",

Strategies for protecting others in a community comprise coughing or sneezing into a tissue and putting the used tissue directly into a waste container; covering one's mouth when coughing; maintaining distance from other people (social distancing); closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls; wearing a surgical mask in public place to limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing(CDC, 2020a; CDC, 2020i).Among all of these measures, social or physical distancing is intended to slow the spread of disease in a community or country effectively, by minimizing close contact between individuals (approximately 2 meters),J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 25 remaining out of crowded public places, avoiding mass gatherings and working from home (CDC, 2020i). During the outbreaks like COVID-19, people sometimes use the terms quarantine and isolation interchangeably, where there is an important distinction between quarantine and isolation (CDC, 2020i). For example, when there is a possibility of exposure of people to COVID-19, they are put in quarantine to help stopping the spread of the disease. On the contrary, the confirmed COVID-19 patients are put into isolation by completely separating them from others to stop the spreading of the disease into others. Having a mask on could cut down on the number of transmissions from asymptomatic people. Because new data cited by Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has shown the high rates of transmission by people who are infected but don't know it yet (CDC, 2020c). An infected person can be contagious for 48 hours before developing symptoms, if they get them at all. CDC is now considering whether to recommend more people -perhaps everybody -wearing a mask when out in public (NewWorkTimes, 2020). Furthermore, self-isolation at home has been recommended for infected patients by COVID-19 and suspected persons (CDC, 2020g; CDC, 2020m). The suspected persons are those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to an affected country or region. Hence the suspected persons are advised to selfquarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. Governments of many countries have already imposed self-quarantine for entire Prevention on National and International level Efforts to prevent the virus spreading on national and international level include travel restrictions; screening at airports and train stations;quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, event postponements and cancellations; facility closures;(Beaubien, 2020;Marsh, 2020;Nikel, 2020;P. et al., 2020;Shao, 2020; Zhou, 2020)  outgoing passenger travel bans(CDC, 2020f; Deerwester and Gilbertson, 2020;NewYorkTimes, 2020). It is also recommended to clean and disinfect the frequently touched surfaces used in public places daily. The contaminated surfaces of public places may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidoneiodine. Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective (CDC, 2020i).f. Using personal protective equipmentPersonal protective equipment (PPE), which is designed to protect the wearer's body from infection, may be worn for job-related occupational safety and health purposes to reduce exposure of employee to the current hazards (transmission of coronavirus) to acceptable levels, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, intubation or hand ventilation(Cheung et al., 2020). During the current pandemic, CDC outlines the specific guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The recommended gear includes N95",

It is a matter of warning about the effects of COVID-19 pandemic spreading to Africa due to the challenging facts (Ahmed, 2020; Maclean, 2020) availed in that region for a long time like inadequate healthcare systems (lack of equipment, lack of funding, insufficient training of healthcare workers, and inefficient data transmission); challenging hand washing, physical distancing as well as lockdowns; prevalence of ongoing diseases (BBC, such as malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, and cholera.

The popular tourist destinations during normal times are Pacific Island nations, some of which are apparently untouched by the coronavirus. These countries and regions include Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tuvalu. The reasons behind this free of coronavirus cases could be considered of their strong isolation and remoteness. Therefore, island nations are assumed to be the original selfisolators in the current perspective. Statistical research on COVID-19 epidemic As it is currently noticed that different parts of the globe are seeing different levels of COVID-19 effects. Because the duration and severity of each pandemic phase can vary depending on the characteristics of the virus and the public health response (CDC, 2020e). Roser et al reviewed the existing global data sources and global statistics published by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (Max Roser et al., 2020). the statistical data of ECDC, Figure 10 was revised in this study for showing the speed of increasing the number of cases in each country since the 100th confirmed cases (from January 22 to April 20, 2020) (Max Roser et al., 2020). The straight grey lines in Figure 10 indicate trajectories for a doubling time of 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, and 10 days, where the \"trajectory\" is the standard starting place for each line on the graph. According to Figure 10, if a country's line is higher than those lines, then its number of cases is doubling faster than that (Max Roser et al., 2020). For example, the trajectory of China had a particular faster rise than other countries like Singapore and Japan. Whereas China and South Korea have showed rapid initial rise. However, this has become plateau after implementing preventive measures and new daily confirmed deaths have been declined. Thus, this graph would be useful to know whether cases in a country now would grow faster, slower, at the same speed as of other countries when it had a similar number. In order to understand the mortality risk of a country, case fatality rate (CFR) can be used as an effective tool, which can be obtained by the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. CFR can change with time, location, number of testing, demography, characteristics of heath care facilities, and other unknown factors. When there is a relatively large number of confirmed cases, CFR can be informative about the severity of the disease and thus proper actions can be implemented in order to minimize the strength of the outbreak.

The swab used for nasopharyngeal collection is a narrow In cases, where NAAT assays are found to be negative but there is still a strong epidemiological connection to COVID-19 infection with consideration of past events or situations, serological surveys can be used for testing for investigation of the ongoing outbreak(WHO, 2020g). For this purpose, paired serum samples could support diagnosis once validated serology tests are available(WHO, 2020g). Some studies with COVID-19 serological data on clinical samples have been published(Bai et al., 2020;Xiao et al., 2020).Monitoring of the viral genomic mutations is important for better performance of medical countermeasures. Therefore, regular sequencing of novel CoV viral gene are clinically appreciated(WHO, 2020g).",

The mild symptoms of COVID-19 may be relieved by taking regular over-the-counter medications, drinking fluids, and resting(CDC,   2020i). Whereas severe cases of COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, conservative fluid managements, breathing support and supporting other affected vital organs(BMJ, 2020; Cheng and Shan, 2020;Liu et al., 2020;Pennsylvania, 2020;Wang et al., 2020;WHO, 2020a). Researchtoward development of vaccine and testing of existing medication approved for treatment of other viral diseases are ongoing in treating COVID-19 patients (McCreary et al., 2020). The vaccine against novel coronavirus is not expected to become available until 2021 at the earliest (Grenfell R, 2020). WHO has provided interim guidance for timely, effective and safe supportive management of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 (WHO, 2020a). The treatment methods of COVID-19 patients recommended by WHO are compiled in the following: For mild COVID-19 cases \u221a Patients with mild disease do not require hospital interventions; but isolation is necessary to contain virus transmission and will depend on national strategy and resources. \u221a Patient with mild COVID-19 require symptomatic treatment such as antipyretics for fever and monitoring. \u221a Patients with mild COVID-19 should be counseled about signs and symptoms of complicated disease. If they develop any of these symptoms, they should seek urgent care through national referral systems.For severe COVID-19 cases\u221a Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patients immediately.\u221a Patients with COVID-19 for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure and sepsis should be closely monitored to respond immediately with supportive care interventions.\u221a The patient's co-morbid condition(s) should be understandable to tailor the management of critical illness.For severe COVID-19 cases along with co-infectionsJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 21 \u221a Empiric antimicrobials should be given to treat all likely pathogens causing sepsis as soon as possible, within 1 hour of initial patient assessment for patients with sepsis.",

As no pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020p), doctors should not prescribe medications that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered \"offlabel\" use (WHO, 2020p). The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. Unnecessary J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided. Besides, all hospitals of every continent should be prepared during this outbreak for identifying and managing COVID-19 patients(Jansson et al., 2020).Since early of 2020, people have been staying indoors across the world for being safe from getting infected or spreading the virus. Almost all the cities of affected countries are seemed to be turn into ghost-cities. Small island nations, which are significantly dependent on tourism, have now their hotels customer-less and beaches without people (UNDP, 2020a). Factories are closing and thus people are losing their jobs as well as income every day.The International Labour Organization estimates that 25 million jobs could be lost, which could lose at least US$220 billion in income in developing countries(ILO, 2020). Hence, the living conditions in the world has been turning into hostile environment for human being.

As a result, factors like uncertain future, travel bans, social distancing, home quarantine, possibility of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infections, and isolation of patients etc. during the current outbreak has caused public panic and mental health stress(Bao et al., 2020). Moreover, it is realizable from the current ongoing situation that the current COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest challenge we have faced since World War II (Two).As confirmed COVID-19 cases are increasing every day in many countries, it has become much more than a global health crisis, which is thus creating a global stress with devastating mental, social, economic, and political crises while reversing development gains achieved over the last 20 years. Now, every country needs to act immediately to prepare, respond, and recover for the current pandemic. The national and international public and private organizations must join the current COVID-19 fight in order to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and build resilience to crises and shocks (Gon\u00e7alves-S\u00e1, 2020). Already, several international organizations have started to support the COVID-19 affected countries. For example, WHO encourages the sharing of data for better understanding to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, and to develop countermeasures(WHO, 1948). In addition, WHO Operation Support and Logistics (OSL) continues to monitor critical markets and in partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (WHO, 2020c). Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL has shipped more than 8,00,000 surgical masks, 54,000 N95 masks, 8,73,000 gloves, 15,000 goggles and 24,000 face shields to 75 countries and also COVID-19 testing kits to 126 countries (WHO, 2020c). United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been supporting countries since the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f very early stages of this crisis, donating more than two million surgical masks and providing life supporting medical equipment, such as X-ray machines, infrared thermometers, infusion pumps, protective suits, gloves, and hand sanitizer(UNDP, 2020a). UNDP is also supporting health systems in countries including Bosnia, Herzegovina, Djibouti, El Salvador, Eritrea, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Nigeria, Paraguay, Panama and Ukraine (UNDP, 2020a). Additionally, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has launched a US$2 billion global humanitarian response plan in the most vulnerable (UNDP, 2020b). The World Bank, which has a long record of supporting health care, has announced an initial package of up to $12 billion in immediate support to affected countries (WorldBank, 2020).",
