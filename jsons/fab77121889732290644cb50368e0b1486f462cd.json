            "text": "This study mainly aimed to optimize a sustainable and green process for extracting bioactive compounds from Foshou fruit by using an integrated technique based on ultrasonic-microwave assisted extraction (UMAE). Response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box-Behnken design was applied to determine optimal conditions. The following optimized UMAE processing parameters were obtained: sonication time (96.13 s), microwave power (305.28 W), and solid/solvent ratio (1:37). Based on a total phenolic compound extraction yield of 9.21 mg gallic acid (GA) equ/g dry weight (DW), a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 27.52 \u03bcg GA equ, and an antioxidant capacity detected by 2,2\u2032-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay of 8.79 mg trolox equ/g DW. The optimized UMAE extract was superior to those obtained using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) or conventional solvent extraction (CSE) methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the three extraction methods affected the sample tissue microstructure. Among them, UMAE caused the most marked structural disruption. UPLC-PDA-Q-TOF-MS analysis identified 67 phenolic compounds in the optimized UMAE extract of the Foshou fruit extract. This study indicated that the integrated UMAE technique is a suitable and safe technique to enhance the qualitative and quantitative extraction of phenolic compounds from Foshou fruit. These phenolic compounds can be used as a functional food ingredient in industrial production.",

With the sonication time increased to 180 s, the yield decreased to 8.13 mg GA equ/g DW due to thermal degradation of the phenolic compounds. Based on these outcomes, we chose a sonication time of 90 s for the subsequent single-factor experiments, while sonication times of 60, 90, and 120 s were used for RSM experiments. The microwave power level had a significant effect on the TPC yield. With an increasing in microwave power from 200 W to 300 W, the TPC yield increased from 8.59 mg GA equ/g DW to 9.10 mg GA equ/g DW (the highest TPC yield), respectively.

Statistically, there were no significant differences between the TPC yields at microwave power levels of 200, 500, 600, and 700 W, probably due to the degradation of phenolic compounds when using high levels of microwave power during the extraction process [33] .

In this study, the model F value (163.44) was significant, and the p-value Prob > F was < 0.0001 (< 0.05). Furthermore, the lack of fit F-value of < 0.001 was not significant, and the p-value Prob > F was 0.51 (> 0.05). The value of R 2 was (0.9953), indicating that the model satisfactorily described the real relationships between the chosen variables. The Adjusted R-squared (R 2 Adj ) value in the model (0.9892) was close to R 2 . Moreover, the Predicted R-squared (R 2 pred ) value (0.9648) was in reasonable agreement with R 2 adj . This confirms that the model was highly significant, where the difference was < 0.2. The regression coefficient from the experimental data and the adjusted data were reasonably close to 1, which indicated a high degree of correlation between the observed and predicted values.",

The combination of disruption of plant tissues by acoustic cavitation caused by ultrasonic/microwaves and solvent flow into plant cell tissues facilitated by thermal stress resulting from microwave irradiation can improve the effectiveness of extraction . SEM images of treated and untreated Foshou fruit powder are shown in Fig. 3 . Images of untreated Foshou fruit powder and powder after extraction by UMAE, MAE, and CSE under the optimized conditions are shown in Fig. 3a -d, respectively. The SEM images showed remarkable changes in the microstructure of the Foshou fruit powder samples after extraction. Ultrasonic/microwave-assisted extraction through the cavitation phenomenon helped to decaythe sample plant tissues, while microwave power led to further disintegration of the plant tissue. By contrast, the conventional solvent extraction had only a slight effect on the tissue microstructure, with no oserve of disintegration.",

Response surface methodology based a Box-Behnken design was successfully used to optimize the performance of ultrasonic/microwave-assisted technique and enhance the extraction processes. Findings of this work showed that the integrated ultrasonic/microwave-assisted extraction was more efficient than the microwave-assisted extraction or conventional solvent extraction as obtaining the highest TPC yield and antioxidant activity from Foshou fruit. In sum, Foshou fruit can be considered a good source of TPC that possess a high antioxidant activity, and thus can be used as safe food additives instead of synthetic additives. In the same context, ultrasonic/microwave-assisted extraction can be used as a safe integrated technique that does not require the use of harmful solvents. ",
