Although its use has been consolidated for bacterial infections (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus), its role in viral infections still deserves some consideration. The authors agree that, from the practical point of view, it is more feasible, eliminating the use of suction systems, probes, and more specialized training, when compared to aspirate or lavage samples. However, only those with more advanced technology (flocked swab), which provides best capture and release of cells and, therefore, of the virus, are equivalent to the aspirate in terms of sample quality. Nevertheless, this swab is not routinely used in services and researches in Brazil.38\n",

This finding is important, given the difficulty in defining asthma in children younger than 3 years, which should be considered in case selection.2, 21 Moreover, it is known that there is a considerable difference between the age groups and the most prevalent viruses, such as the hRSV.60 Regarding the methods of respiratory secretion collection in the included studies, there was no uniform means of collection; the aspirate was used in 43.8% of studies, the swab in 31.6%, both in 25%, and the flocked swab was not used.

When the inflammatory process typical of asthma is associated with a viral respiratory infection, there is a tendency to greater severity and duration, as well as a poorer response to conventional treatment of the acute episode.32, 33 The involved mechanisms still need to be fully elucidated, evidencing the synergistic effect between viral infection and allergic airway inflammation in the pathogenesis of exacerbations.30, 43\n",

Respiratory viruses infect bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) through tool-like receptors (TLRs).

The dendritic cells (DCs), components of the innate immunity, are directed to secondary lymphoid organs after capturing viral antigens, where they stimulate the lymphoid cells, the protagonists of the specific immune response. In asthma patients, the production of IFNs is reduced, allowing for greater viral replication and under stimulation of TSLP, there is a deviation from lymphoid profile to helper T lymphocyte 2 (Th2), promoting lower antiviral response and increased allergic inflammation, with bronchial hyperreactivity and increased production of mucus, causing bronchial obstruction and asthma exacerbation.",
