The WHO declared the resulting disease a pandemic.2. The virus, which causes severe respiratory illness in susceptible individuals, has spread so rapidly that it threatens to saturate health services, particularly their intensive care capacity. While this presently concerns mainly Italy,3 Spain,4 and France, other countries, such as the United States, may well succumb as it is difficult to predict how the infection will spread in the general population. A calibrated response to the epidemic must take into account the number of cases, including infected asymptomatic individuals, most of whom are not detected due to a lack of testing. The existing models for SARS-CoV-2 are based on published positive cases and do not take into account either people's age or any evolutive diffusion coefficient.5\n",

Figures 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e showed predictions of new cases per day depending on the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence before and after the containment phase. Figure 1.b indicates that the seroprevalence before March 17 was 8.3%, and 17.5% after containment. There was an infection rebound on May 29. However, if the seroprevalence at the beginning of containment was 15.44% (Figure 1.c), the seroprevalence on May 11 would be 29.1% and there was an infection rebound. If 31.95% of the population contracted SARS-CoV-2 before March 17 (Figure 1.d), then 49% would be infected, immunized or dead on May 11 and the rebound would be smaller. Lastly, when the seroprevalence before containment was 40.05% (Figure 1.e) there was almost no rebound. The seroprevalence on May 11 was 56.7%. This is why we conclude that the seroprevalence after the containment phase should be between 49% and 56% in order to avoid a rebound.",

While the seroprevalence in France before the confinement phase was not measured (March 17) it is probably possible to determine the proportion of the population who came into contact with the virus at the end of the confinement phase. This should provide a basis for estimating the size of any infection rebound. It remains highly unlikely that the case shown in Figure 1.e, with about 50% of seroprevalence, will apply. It will therefore be a question of adapting the deconfinement strategy to reach 50% seroprevalence gradually and so avoid a rebound. This may require wearing masks for several months.",
