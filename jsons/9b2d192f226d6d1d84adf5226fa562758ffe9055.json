In some pathogenic bacteria, an operon-encoded mono-ADP-ribosylation cycle mediates response to host-induced oxidative stress. In this system, reversible mono ADP-ribosylation of a lipoylated target protein represses oxidative stress response. An NAD 1 -dependent sirtuin catalyzes the single ADP-ribose (ADPr) addition, while a linked macrodomain-containing protein removes the ADPr. Here we report the crystal structure of the sitruin-linked macrodomain protein from Staphylococcus aureus, SauMacro (also known as SAV0325) to 1.75-\u00c5 resolution. The monomeric SauMacro bears a previously unidentified Zn 21 -binding site that putatively aids in substrate recognition and catalysis. An amino-terminal three-helix bundle motif unique to this class of macrodomain proteins provides a structural scaffold for the Zn 21 site. Structural features of the enzyme further indicate a cleft proximal to the Zn 21 binding site appears well suited for ADPr binding, while a deep hydrophobic channel in the protein core is suitable for binding the lipoate of the lipoylated protein target.",

            "text": "The reversible post-translational transfer of adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPr) moieties to proteins enables cells to dynamically control response to external stimuli. In bacteria, ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) are the primary family of proteins responsible for ADP-ribosylation of target proteins. 1, 2 Sirtuin proteins also have established functions in diverse cellular processes such as aging, metabolic regulation and gene silencing. 3 While they typically catalyze protein deacetylation reactions, members of the Sirtuin family including the macrodomain-linked sirtuins (SirTMs) have been shown to exhibit ADPribosylating activity. [3] [4] [5] Both ARTs and SirTMs utilize a bound nicotamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD 1 ) cofactor, and in their reactions release nicotamide while covalently linking ADPr to a substrate. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Substrates may be either a specific amino acid (usually a glutamate/aspartate or lysine) on the target protein, or in the case of some eukaryotic ARTs, another ADPr though a glycosidic ribose-ribose bond forming linear and branched polymers. Structurally conserved in all domains of life, ARTs are an ancient protein class with diverse modifying abilities and target proteins. Bacterial ARTs act as toxins, modifying host cell signaling proteins, resulting in cell death and disease. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ARTs primarily transfer a single ADPr, a reaction referred to as mono-ADPribosylation (MARylation). In eukaryotes, ARTs have evolved into two distinct classes, those that resemble bacterial, MARylating ARTs and those capable of labeling target proteins with structurally and functionally diverse ADPr polymeric chains. 11, 12 The latter enzymes are often referred to as poly-ADPr polymerases (PARPs), and control diverse cellular processes including transcription and DNA repair through poly-ADPribosylation (PARlyation). [11] [12] [13] [14] The existence and coordination of enzymes capable of both mono ADP-ribosylation and poly ADPribosylation of target proteins paints a picture of a complex and regulated network of ARTs that can quickly and specifically alter cellular physiology post-translationally. 2 A number of enzymes complete the ADPr modifying cycle by catalyzing the removal of ADPr from poly-ADPr-targeted proteins. 15 Many of these proteins contain a macrodomain fold, which enables selective recognition of ADPr 16 and discrimination between mono-and poly-ADPr. 15 Initially discovered associated with peptidases in viruses 17 macrodomains have been found in all forms of life, but it was not until crystal structures of macrodomain proteins from the thermophile Archaeoglobus flulgidus 16, 18 and subsequently coronavirus 19 were their ADPr binding functions understood. Possessing a central six or seven stranded mixed b-sheet sandwiched by four to five a-helices, the macrodomain presents an L-shaped cleft that envelops the ADPr moiety largely through conserved protein backbone interactions, as well as aspartate-N6 adenosine and asparagine-O2 0 ribose interactions. Macrodomain proteins also function as O-acetyl-ADPr deacetylases, removing the acetyl moiety from the common reaction product of sirtuins. 20 The macrodomain-containing family includes the Poly-ADPr glycohydrolases (PARGs). [20] [21] [22] The catalytic functions of two additional human macrodomain proteins capable of reversing the glutamate-linked mono-ADPr, MacroD2, 23, 24 and TARG1 (Terminal ADP-Ribose Glycohydrolase 1), 25 have also been reported. Thus, the ADP-ribosylation cycle, including MARylation and/or PARylation, can be completed via macrodomain-mediated removal of the terminal ADPr.",

At the center of this regulation is a MARylation/ deMARylation cycle, where a novel class of macrodomain-linked sirtuins (SirTM) catalyzes the NAD 1 -dependent transfer of a mono-ADPr to GcvH-L, while a macrodomain protein removes the moiety [ Fig. 1(A) ]. Rack et al. showed that only a lipoylated GcvH-L could be MARylated by SirTM. Lipoylated GcvH-L is also efficiently deMARylated by the macrodomain (SauMacro for S. aureus and SpyMacro for S. pyogenes). Altogether, the study points to the modification of a shuttle protein (GcvH-L) with a redoxactive molecule (lipoate) under reversible control of a sirtuin/macrodomain-catalyzed negative feedback mechanism, where MARlyated GcvH-L represses and deMARlyated GcvH-L activates pathogen redox defense. 5 While the molecular basis of SirTM function has been established, 5 the structure and function of the SauMacro protein remains less well defined. Here, we report the crystal structure of SauMacro (a.k.a. Sav0325) to 1.75-\u00c5 resolution. Through sequence and structural analysis, we demonstrate that the SirTM-linked macrodomain protein family consists of a core macrodmain fold decorated by an Nterminal 3-helix bundle which scaffolds a novel Zn 21 coordination loop proximal to the ADPr binding site. SauMacro is further characterized by a conspicuous hydrophobic protein core cavity that is suitable for engagement of the lipoylated target substrate. Structures were aligned using MatchMaker in Chimera. 26 SauMacro Zn 21 is rendered as a sphere (magenta). All figures were prepared in Chimera 26 unless otherwise indicated.",

            "text": "Notably, in the absence of 80 amino-terminal sequence, proteins with high sequence homology to SauMacro also lack the Zn 21 binding motif. Thus the three-helix bundle N-terminal extension appears to provide an extended structural scaffold for the Zn 21 -binding b2-a1 insertion loop. The proximity of the Zn 21 -binding motif to the predicted ADPr pocket implies that it may play roles in substrate binding and catalysis. The conserved residues C113, H118, and C120 mediate Zn 21 -coordination [ Fig. 2(A) ]. To validate the identity of the metal, we conducted X-ray fluorescence measurements on purified SAV0325 protein [ Fig. 2(C) ]. This analysis indicates that Zn is abundant in our protein purifications, consistent with Zn 21 modeled in the crystal structure. We also note that binding site geometry is consistent with a Zn 21 binding as confirmed by the \"checkmymetal\" (CMM) binding site validation server 27 (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/ ). The loop containing the 113-CxxxxHxC-120 Zn 21 binding motif appears to be an insertion relative to other known macrodomain structures, all of which replace this Zn 21 -binding sequence with a polyglycine linker. An inspection of the surface of Sau-Macro relative to other macrodomains containing ADPr reveals that the Zn 21 -binding motif does not occlude the canonical ADPr substrate-binding cleft. Interestingly, Asp55 of a symmetry related SauMacro molecule completes the tetrahedral coordination shell of the bound Zn 21 [ Fig. 2(B) ]. In the case of SpyGcvH-L, the MARlyated residue is expected to be either and Asp or Glu, 5 so the observed Asp55-Zn 21 interaction might reflect a possible substratebinding mode of the ADP-ribosylated target. Thus, we hypothesize that SauMacro and related sirtuinlinked macrodomains use this Zn 21 site to coordinate substrate binding and/or electron movements during catalysis.",

Notably, the loop between a4 and b6 is found in a conformation that partially occludes the predicted ADPr binding site, in a mode reminiscent of apo MacroD1. The CASTp server identifies a large contiguous solvent-accessible surface pocket in proximity to the Zn 21 site [Fig. 3(A-D) ]. This pocket comprises over 1400 \u00c5 2 of surface area, and can be divided into two main sections connected via a narrow tunnel: one adjacent to the Zn 21 and the others containing the conserved acidic residue D93. Mapping the ADPr from the MacroD2 structure (PDB: 4IQY) onto this surface places the terminal ribose (ribose'') in the Zn 21 -adjacent pocket and the adenosine near D93. Electrostatic surface analysis implicates the surface around the Zn 21 pocket as electropositive, while the surface that would presumably contact the adenosine as electronegative [ Fig. 3(B) ]. Taken together, we infer that the identified pocket could accommodate the ADPr, consistent with SauMacro de-ADP-ribosylation function. 5 Next, we structurally aligned a number of similar macrodomains predicted by the DALI server to have similar structural features (Z score > 19) [ Table II , Fig. 3(C) ]. All of the compared structures contain an ADPr or ADPr-like bound substrate molecule in a similar spatial orientation on the protein surface. In considering the structurally similar macrodomains, many of the residues involved in substrate recognition are conserved in SauMacro [ Fig. 3(C,D) ]. Important electrostatic interactions include Asp93, which could hydrogen bond to adenine N6 amino group, as well as N107 and D122, both of which would contact the O2 0 hydroxyl of the terminal ribose. Substrate-bound macrodomains contain an aromatic residue that provides p-stacking interactions with the adenosine base; in SauMacro, F249 may perform this role [ Fig. 3(D) ]. C209, as well as the hydrophobic residues I94, I121, L187, and I211 line the pocket that could accommodate ADPr. G214 is a well-conserved residue, and the presence of a bulky side chain at this position would likely occlude ADPr phosphate binding. Some backbone rearrangements of SauMacro would be necessary to prevent clashes with ADPr, especially the loop connecting b5 and a4. Overall, the surface properties of this cleft, strong sequence homology to known ADPrmacrodomain complexes, and the previous report that SauMacro acts as an ADPr hydrolase 5 strongly implicate that ADPr binds in the predicted pocket.",

As a recently discovered class of oxidative-stress response regulators in pathogenic bacteria, the biochemical and biomedical relevance of these molecules are only beginning to be understood. Our structure suggests that SauMacro is a unique macrodomain protein with a novel Zn 21 binding insertion loop relative to other macrodomains. A threehelix bundle provides the structural scaffolding for this site, and sequence homology implies that this amino-terminal structure may be conserved for related macrodomains in bacteria and fungi. Through structural homology and analysis, we propose potential binding sites for ADPr and lipoate on SauMacro. Future co-crystal structures of SauMacro in complex with these substrates, or with the GcvH-L target protein, and in concert with biochemical analysis, will provide the foundation for potential novel antimicrobials targeting this stress response pathway.",

Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, sonicated and clarified by centrifugation. Affinity chromatography was accomplished by flowing clarified cell lysate over Ni-NTA resin. Bound protein was eluted by addition of imidazole and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.1% bME. Prior to crystallization a purified SAV0325 was subjected to limited trypsin digest at room temperature for 1 hr at a ratio of 650:1 (w/w) SauMacro to trypsin. Trypsinized protein was resolved by additional sizeexclusion purification, followed by a final cationexchange purification eluted in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 175 mM NaCl, and 0.1% bME. The resulting fractions from the single peak from the ion-exchange purification were pooled and concentrated to 25 mg/mL for crystallographic screening.",
