FP\u2010HR2 protein consists of FP, HR1, HR2, and IH domains. The concentrations of IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102, and IL\u20104 in FP\u2010HR2 protein\u2010immunized mice were significantly higher than those of IH protein\u2010immunized mice. This suggests that, except for the IH domain, the FP, HR1, and/or HR2 region contains a highly immunogenic site. IH protein showed less immunogenicity in mice, especially in regard to induction of IFN\u2010\u03b3, than did FP\u2010HR2 protein. However, stimulation with IH\u20102, a peptide derived from the IH region, induced IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, suggesting the presence of Th1 epitopes. Reportedly, SARS\u2010CoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus produce no neutralizing antibodies after immunization of mice with a peptide containing a neutralizing epitope, but enhance immunogenicity and produce neutralizing antibodies when bound to a peptide with Th1 epitopes (26, 27). The HR1 and HR2 regions contain peptides with the Th1 epitopes identified in this study, (i.e. HR1\u20107, HR1\u201014, HR2\u20104, and HR2\u201011). Thus, IH protein alone is unlikely to recognize antigen\u2010presenting cells; however, FP\u2010HR2 protein (i.e. IH protein bound to HR1 and HR2) may exhibit greater immunogenicity.",

Amino acid sequences predicted by the National Institute of Health (http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/) to have a strong capacity to bind to HLA\u2010A24, were explored in the FP, HR1, and HR2 regions. The results demonstrated the presence of epitopes showing a marked capacity to bind to aa1109\u20101117 (HR1\u20108) of the HR1 region and aa1319\u20101327 (HR2\u20101), aa1337\u20101345 (HR2\u20103 and HR2\u20104), aa1349\u20101357 (HR2\u20105), and aa1406\u20101414 (HR2\u201011) of the HR2 region. Among these peptides, HR2\u20104 and HR2\u201011 induced IFN\u2010\u03b3 production in this experiment. This suggests that these two peptides are MHC class I\u2010binding peptides with the Tc1 epitope. The other peptides, HR1\u20107, HR1\u201014, and IH\u20102, have the Th1 epitope.",
