The challenging issues include the security concerns as the main background to develop this approach is based upon the effective cloudconnected database. The interoperability is another concern in addition to the data security during IoMT functioning. There is always a need to create a dynamic, connected scheme to merge these advanced digital facilities following the medical facilities and services. In providing more impactful training to the medical personnel, the future investigations should be targeted to create additional sessions for creating further clinical reasoning, more targets to be set for poor and remote locations during COVID-19 period, the differential diagnosis for symptom localization, joint & soft tissue assessment studies, etc. Moreover, further research should be attempted to create a more digital resolution for the muscle stretching techniques, thoracic manipulation, locking tactics for spines, cloud data based prescription for spine exercise, etc.",
