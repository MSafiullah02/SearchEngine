Based on this factor, a new type of spherical cinnamon nanoclusters (Cin-NCs) were synthesised using eco-friendly nanosecond pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) approach. As-grown nontoxic Cin-NCs suspended in the citric acid of pH 4.5 (acted as organic solvent) were characterised thoroughly to evaluate their structural, optical and bactericidal properties. The effects of various laser fluences (LF) at the fixed wavelength (532 nm) on the physiochemical properties of these Cin-NCs were determined. The FTIR spectra of the Cin-NCs displayed the symmetric-asymmetric stretching of the functional groups attached to the heterocyclic/cinnamaldehyde compounds. The HR-TEM image of the optimum sample revealed the nucleation of the crystalline spherical Cin-NCs with a mean diameter of approximately 10 \u00b1 0.3 nm and lattice fringe spacing around 0.14 nm. In addition, the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) and optical density (OD 600 ) of the proposed Cin-NCs were measured to assess their antibacterial potency against the Staphylococcus aureus (IZD \u2248 24 mm) and Escherichia coli (IZD \u2248 25 mm) bacterial strains. The strong UV absorption (in the range of 269 and 310 nm) shown by these NCs was established to be useful for the antibacterial drug development and food treatment.",

Such active cinnamomic elements and their condimental properties have unpredictably varying pharmacological functions including anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-viral and antiageing [5] [6] [7] [8] . On top, various phytochemical studies on the cinnamon bark (cassia) have been long-established in vitro and vivo, revealing the existence of diterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids without any side effect or toxicity [8] . Despite these promising curative features, the extensive utilization of the cinnamon bark as an active biocidal agent is very minimal and low in pharmacodynamics action due to its poor dispersal and aqueous solubility as well as the lower absorption in the gastrointestinal process, and rapid metabolism to decrease foodstuffs (coumarin, di-tetra, hexahydrocinnamon, heterocyclic, eugenol, flavonoids and cinnamaldehyde) [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

The conventional ONCs from their bulk sources can be obtained using the nanotechnology route. These tiny ONCs reveal enhanced pharmacological effects with improved solubilisation, biocompatibility, pharmacokinetic profile and the drug formulation [10] . In the nanoscale structures (nanoparticles or NCs, nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, nanofilms, nanofluid, etc.), the surface area to volume is significantly large, leading to the emergent physiochemical traits (such as efficient reactivity) that are absent in their bulk counterparts. More interesting features of these ONCs are related to the excellent interfaces with organic/genetic macromolecules such as membranes, DNA, proteins and RNA [10] . In fact, the protein molecules/structures that adsorbed effortlessly on their surfaces when bound to ONCs. Over the decades, to produce the high-quality ONCs with desirable size, phase, shape and elemental compositions several strategies have been adopted including the mechanical grinding/milling, plasma induced creation and chemical routes [6, 11] . Nonetheless, these growth methods are inadequate because of the poor stability of the formed ONCs, requisites of the further chemical purification, extreme-temperature reaction state, long-term consumption, and difficulty in the disruption ONCs [11, 12] .",

The PLAL method is handy owing to its simplicity, economy, and efficiency. On top, it enables the large-scale reproducibility without requiring the toxic materials. Yet again, it is versatile for fabricating the inorganic-organic NCs with unique surface chemistry and reactive quenching of the ablated species [13, 14] . Using this strategy, the physical/chemical properties of the ONCs can be controlled by adjusting the pulse laser parameters (fluence/energy density, width, wavelength, repetition rate, and duration) and liquid media [13] [14] [15] . Asahi and his co-authors disclosed that the higher fluence-ablation energy leads to the smaller size of NCs depending on the laser wavelength and pulse width [15, 16] . Additionally, Zhang et al reported that the continuous laser shots can increase the yield of the NCs [15] .

The PLAL supported growth mechanism was clarified in terms of a simple process relating to the cavitation bubble dynamic forces, plasma generation, and the impact of pulse laser factors on the formation of the ONCs [17, 18] . It has been comprehended that an interrelated laser pulse with a surface cinnamon target causes the formation of expanded plasma plume and cavitation bubble. Consequently, the cavitation bubble is then collapsed, leading a spreading of Cin-NCs into the citric acid solution. In general, the cavitation bubble lifetime extends with induced by the former pulse repetition rate and increasing of LF, thus the NCs production is higher [15, 18] . The mass profusion of Cin-NCs diverse to the bubble's form shows the nonappearance of high-density slope of cluster particles once the cavitation bubble has been to its maximum height. Premkumar et al. synthesised AgNPs doped cinnamon oil and evaluated their antimicrobial against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria strains [19] . The nano/ micro emulsions from the cinnamon have been studied by Yildirim et al. [20] that confirmed its bioactivity against several pathogenic bacteria. The ONCs obtained from curcumin compound were indeed produced by chemical wet-milling, grinding milling and electro-hydrodynamic atomization method to test their antibacterial action [21] . Yet, growth of systematic preparation method for nature Cin-NCs with customised particle sizes and preferred antibacterial actions still remain challenging [22] .",

Up to 0.7 mJ/cm 2 of pulse laser irradiation, it visibly revealed the variation in the Cin-NCs morphology, crystallinity and size dispersion (Inset 1) [26] . Meanwhile, the enhancement in the absorption peak intensity was increased with increasing LF, suggesting that the Cin-NCs density and particle size impacted by higher LF [24] . The appearance of a weak peak followed with a blue shift (Inset 2) was consigned to the attendance of ring of benzoyl, cinnamoyl system, and aromatic amino acid groups of proteins structure in the nucleated Cin-NCs [3, 4] . Where, these little absorption bands ranged of 269-266 nm were observed because of the amino acid residues in the cinnamon protein structure (tyrosine and tryptophan yielding). On top, the high absorption peaks were obtained in the range of 304-310 nm with gradual increased accompanying a blue shift (shorter wavelength) as displayed in Inset (3). This revelation was attributed to the quantum yields of Cin-NCs and the molecules interaction of citric acid solution as described elsewhere [14, [24] [25] [26] . Also, it occurred due to the chemical bonds for instance the cinnamaldehyde, coumarin, eugenol, di-tetra, hexahydrocinnamon, terpenoids, caryophyllene, heterocyclic, carboxyl, ethyl cinnamate and optical absorption properties of Cin-NCs. Overall, they may be contributing to the distinctive aroma and organic activity of Cin-NCs [12] .

This was due to the existence of the polyphenols, heterocyclic and cinnamaldehyde compounds in the Cin [9] . Furthermore, the absorption peaks were located at 1414 cm \u22121 assigned to carbon-hydroxyl groups (C-O) of aromatic amines that conjugates from aromatic ring in the Cin [25] . All these peaks confirmed the absorption of the cinnamon molecules and amide linkages of proteins attached on the surface of the NCs by different functional groups as reported earlier [9, 25] . The observed shift was due to the presence of the cinnamaldehyde (main compound of cinnamon) and enlargement in the particle size. Additionally, the stabilization of the Cin-NCs within the compound matrix which was attributed to the molecular interactions of the phenyls and cinnamaldehyde compounds with the surrounding citric acid molecules. Moreover, this indicated the covering of Cin-NCs by the secondary plant metabolites of (terpenoids, flavonoids, heterocyclic, aldehyde, coumarin, phenols and tannins) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] which reveals new attachments to the bacterial membranes wall [14] . Fig. 3 (a-c) displays the shape, phase, particle size, elemental composite and lattice plane structure with crystalline fringe images of the finest Cin-NCs (grown at LF of 2.2 mJ/cm 2 ). Fig. 3 (a) showed the predominance of spherical shaped Cin-NCs grown in the solution with histogram size distribution ranged of 2-26 nm (Inset). The existence of unique spherical morphology of the Cin-NCs was ascribed to the finely created atoms that were restricted via the existing nuclei throughout the dispersion-controlled growth media that are useful for developing the antibacterial drug [23] . The EDX spectra (Fig. 3 (b) ) of the obtained Cin-NCs revealed the natural elemental compositions in the presence of Si, C, O, Fe, Al, Cu, Sn and Ca. The percentage of the intense elemental peaks of C, O, Si and Al (as tabulated of the inset of Fig. 3 (b) ) were ascribed to the protein capping over the Cin-NCs. The presence of various chemical compounds in the cinnamon was identified by LC/MS analysis. The LC chromatograms of the citric acid containing the cinnamon before and after the laser ablation were recorded (not shown here). The emergence of several new peaks clearly revealed the existence of the Cin-NCs in the citric acid formed by the laser ablation at optimum fluence of 2.2 mJ/cm 2 .",

These observations confirmed the growth of the Cin-NCs along the preferred lattice planer direction with concentric rings and bright circular spots. Besides, the lattice spacing (\u2248 0.14 nm) of the NC (Inset (c3)) unveiled the consistent fringe of the lattice plane as clearly presented in the Fig. 3 c (Inset c4) . Fig. 3c (Inset c6) shows the XRD patterns (in the 2\u03b8 range from 20\u00b0to 80\u00b0) of the synthesized Cin-NCs at the optimum laser fluence of 2.2 mJ/cm 2 . The marked five significant diffraction peaks centered at the 2\u03b8 values of 15\u00b0, 24.4\u00b0, 30.2\u00b0, 38.2\u00b0and 52.6\u00b0were due to the growth orientation along (0 0 1), (2 2 0), (0 0 2), (3 1 1) and (4 4 0) lattice planes, respectively. These intense and sharp XRD peaks indicated the nucleation of highly crystalline face center cubic (fcc) structure of Cin-NCs (DB Card Number 01-074-9D14) wherein the width of the XRD peaks can be attributed to crystallite size of the NCs.",

Additionally, the selected LF of 2.2 mJ/cm 2 has exposed high density and crystalline spherical Cin-NCs. The fast diffusion assisted growth of the Cin-NCs and multiphoton absorption together with the lattice oscillation was responsible for such behavior [24] . Subsequently, the fast-annealed mechanical destruction was acted before the thermal equilibrium was achieved in the citric acid solution, turning to the formation of the smaller Cin-NCs. After the diffusion of LF into the citric acid solvent, the Cin-NCs temperature was dropped to the room temperature before the following pulse laser was reached [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

The IZD valuation was used to inspect the antibacterial effectiveness of the newly prepared Cin-NCs ( Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). The Cin-NCs were filled into the holes sited on the Petri dishes as illustrated in Fig. 5A (red-circle) and the IZD surrounded the hole was measured (Fig. 5 (A,B) ). All the Cin-NCs suspension and blank (citric acid solution) with varying diameters of Cin-NCs (3-26 nm) that were acquired at different LF (from 0.7 mJ/cm 2 up to 4.3 mJ/cm 2 ) revealed a high inhibitory impact (Fig. 5 A and B) . Nevertheless, the occurrence of the broadest width of the IZD (measured in mm) that was attained for the best sample S4-90 established its highest antibacterial action. The LF dependent particular IZD (24 and 25 mm) for the bacteria strains E. coli and S. aureus were matched with the selected antibiotic agent (Fig. 5 (A,a) and (B,b) ). The detected assortment in the antibacterial drug (Cin-NCs) was due to the alterations in the bacterial cell wall membrane structure [2] , wherein this cell wall of E. coli bacteria was encompassed to the actual thin lipopolysaccharide and a peptidoglycan [30] . These lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides structures were both comprised of the coupled lipids with negative charges, indicating that a less permeability into the Cin-NCs. Contrariwise, the bacteria membrane structure of S. aureus created a thick peptidoglycan, enfolding of linear polysaccharide chains cross connected by small peptides to construct a static structure in 3-D that trapped the permeation of the Cin-NCs to the bacteria structure [30] . The obtained IZD for the Cin-NCs revealed to be higher than the earlier reported values [9, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . This outcome was attributed to the existence of cinnamaldehyde, flavonoids, cinnamic, polyphenols, heterocyclic and the coumarin constituents [6, 11] .",

            "text": "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the ONCs as antibacterial agent [30] [31] [32] . According to Feng et al. [31] , the mechanism and association revisions of the antibacterial effectiveness to the separation of cytoplasm membrane cell can verify the destruction of the duplicate ability of DNA and the protein annihilation in the bacteria. Furthermore, Shrivastava et al. [32] inspected the interface of the E. coli and S. aureus bacterial cell wall with interrelated Cin-NCs where the altering tyrosine phosphorylation structures were agued to be the reason for the antibacterial efficiency of the nanostructures. The mechanism behind the antibacterial potency of the proposed Cin-NCs is related to their unique physiochemical attributes that enable the penetration through the cell membrane to create oxidative stress. Consequently, the protein sortase at the bacterial cell surface are efficiently inhibited, preventing the coalescence of the bacterial cells to fibronectin. The results affirmed that the Cin-NCs can adhere onto the bacterial cell walls and break them before being infiltrated within the membrane to rupture chemical components of the cell organelles. It has been established that the tinier nanoparticles reveal stronger bactericidal properties. Lee et al. [33] reported that nanoparticles with mean size range from 5 to 80 nm can destroy the microorganisms (bacteria such as the S. aureus and E. coli) by penetrating inside the bacterial cell membranes. In fact, tinier Cin-NCs can rupture efficiently the intracellular oxygen bonds, resulting in the severe oxidative damages and thus allowing the ultimate destruction of the bacterial cells membrane. Fig. 5 (c) and (d) illustrates the growth of the E. coli and S. aureus in the LB media, detected under the optical density (OD 600 ) with different LF. The antibacterial activity of the Cin-NCs (particle diameter) were examined on the blank suspension (citric acid) and containing Cin-NCs (synthesis at varied LF) for each 5 h interval duration up to 45 h. Our results for optimum sample S4-90 showed that the lower OD 600 of bacteria containing Cin-NCs after cultivation for a proper time verified the strongest antibacterial activity (Fig. 5 (c, d) ) and Table 1 ). This disclosure was accredited to the influence of the Cin-NCs on the intracellular materials and subsequent destruction of the bacterial membrane structure that caused the coagulation and removal of cells in the liquid system. In addition, the Cin-NCs (S4-90 sample) with mean size of 10 \u00b1 0.3 nm had appreciable effect against the bacterial growth. This was due to the large surface area to volume ratio of the Cin-NCs that has strong interfacial interaction with the bacterial membranes structure [34, 35] .",

However, the structural and antibacterial traits of the Cin-NCs produced in the citric acid media have never been evaluated. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to determine the feasibility of achieving some better Cin-NCs morphologies and structures inside the citric acid as the growth media with enhanced antibacterial efficiency. Unique traits of these Cin-NCs were well analysed and determined using different spectroscopic and imaging tools. The morphology (size, shape and structure) and optical characteristics of these Cin-NCs were found to be sensitive to the nature of the liquid media and laser fluences. The antibacterial effectiveness of these Cin-NCs was evaluated against different bacteria strains. All the liquid media were favorable for synthesizing the Cin-NCs with strong antibacterial activity. In the present work, these spherical Cin-NCs with high chemical stability produced inside the citric acid medium (pH 4.5) demonstrated to have strongest antibacterial effectiveness, Especially, the presence of these Cin-NCs surrounded by the citric acid molecules have great physical properties compared to other media (ethanol and methanol) as shown in Table 2 . These observations can be attributed to the high crystallinity of the Cin-NCs achieved via the optimized PLAL technique. Besides, these Cin-NCs grown inside the citric acid media showed excellent spherical morphologies, indicating their higher potential to delay the bacterial growth more efficiently than those produced inside methanol and ethanol. It is established that the PLAL technique may constitute a basis for the production of the Cin-NCs with desired characteristics useful for the development nanomedicines towards the protein spikes of coronavirus and antibacterial drug design.",

As-prepared NCs were characterised to analyses their structural, optical and antibacterial properties. These Cin-NCs were produced inside the liquid citric acid medium (acted as organic solvent) at various LF in a customized way. The influence of various LF on the structure, morphology, optical and bactericidal properties of the Cin-NCs were determined. The citric acid as a growth medium was demonstrated to be more promising for the fabrication of tiny spherical crystalline Cin-NCs with uniform distribution. In addition, the proposed PLAL method exhibited high productivity of NPs in the absence of any toxic chemicals that is demanding for the future antibacterial drug development. The strong UV-Vis optical absorption at 269 and 310 nm shown by the Cin-NCs may be beneficial for new drug formulation. The FTIR spectra of the Cin-NCs confirmed the existence of the symmetricasymmetric stretching vibrations bands of the active component (polyphenols and cinnamaldehyde functional groups with characteristic bonds). The selected LF of 2.2 mJ/cm 2 produced the best Cin-NCs (size and shape) with the mean diameter of approximately 10 \u00b1 0.3 nm. The antibacterial effectiveness of the Cin-NCs were evaluated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial cultures through the IZD and OD 600 analyses. The best Cin-NCs (S4-90) revealed the strongest antibacterial action (IZD of 24 mm for S.aureus and 25 mm for E. coli). This outstanding antibacterial activity shown by the Cin-NCs was due to their high quantum yield, high stability and well-defined morphology. Also, the OD 600 of the Cin-NCs affirmed their exceptional antibacterial potency when implemented on the bacterias growth over the time intervals of 5 up to the total of 45 h. In short, the PLAL supported growth process/mechanism and the antibacterial efficacy of the produced Cin-NCs was well-understood. The proposed Cin-NCs may be potential for the antibacterial drug formulation.",
