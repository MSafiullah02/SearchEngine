            "text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2/2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19) has created a global pandemic with no approved treatments or vaccines. Many treatments have already been administered to COVID19 patients but have not been systematically evaluated. We performed a systematic literature review to identify all treatments reported to be administered to COVID19 patients and assess time to clinically meaningful response for treatments with sufficient data. We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv for articles reporting treatments for COVID19 patients published between 12/1/2019-3/27/2020. Data were analyzed descriptively. Of the 2,706 articles identified, 155 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 9,152 patients from 14 different countries. The cohort was 45.4% female and 98.3% hospitalized and mean (SD) age was 44.4 years (SD 21.0). The most frequently administered drug classes were antivirals, antibiotics, and corticosteroids, and of the 115 reported drugs, the most frequently administered was combination lopinavir/ritonavir, which was associated with a time to clinically-meaningful response (complete symptom resolution or hospital discharge) of 11.7 (1.09) days. There was insufficient data to compare across treatments. A large number of treatments have been administered to the first 9,152 reported cases of COVID19.

When data on both of these time points were provided, the shortest duration was considered as the TCMR.

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells to gain entry into these cells for viral replication and dissemination in the airway and systemically. [6] Patients with a weakened immune response would be expected to have difficulty controlling COVID19. Patients with a hyper-immune response experience acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ system failure due to a cytokine storm. [7] Treatments used to date have been proposed to work by: 1) limiting entry into ciliated bronchial epithelial cells (N-acetylcysteine, heparin, meplazumab, umifenovir, hydroxychloroquine), 2) inhibiting viral replication (interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2, ritonavir/lopinavir, oseltamivir, ganciclovir, ribavirin, favipiravir, remdesivir, danoprevir), 3) preventing viral dissemination via antibody-mediated neutralization by increasing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (convalescent plasma) or non-specific antibodies (IVIg, thymopentin), 4) strengthening a weakened immune response with immunostimulants (interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2, thymosin-\u03b1-1), 5) preventing a hyper-immune response with immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, IVIg), or 6) controlling a hyper-immune response (corticosteroids, tocilizumab).

[12] Ritonavir/lopinavir, administered 2000 times in this study, is a protease inhibitor approved for HIV that has demonstrated activity against MERS and SARS. [13, 14] Despite its frequent use, one randomized controlled trial included in this study reported no benefit beyond standard of care. However, the study began administration more than 10 days into the disease course, so it is still being studied earlier in disease course. [15] Interferon, the second-most frequently administered agent in this study, is a key anti-viral cytokine produced by the host immune system that can inhibit coronavirus replication and boost the immune response. [16] [17] [18] It was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. [19, 20] Oseltamivir was also used frequently in this study, though the primary intent was likely to prevent concomitant influenza infection and it does not seem to be a promising treatment approach. Remdesivir, a nucleoside inhibitor not yet approved for any indication has demonstrated positive in vitro activity; it was used in a small number of cases. [12] Umifenovir, approved for influenza in China and Russia, demonstrated a TCMR of 10.9 (7.78) days in this study, though sample size was low. A study of 67 patients revealed decreased mortality and improved discharge in patients treated with umifenovir. [21] Interestingly, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated greater clinical improvement in favipiravir-treated patients than umifenovir among moderately ill patients. [22] Convalescent plasma was only given in 12 cases, but it was used previously to treat MERS and SARS and a number of studies are underway. [23] [24] [25] ",

Drug repurposing is the fastest route towards an effective and accessible treatment against COVID19 before a vaccine is available. A previously unquantified but large number of treatments have been tried off-label or experimentally. To date, only small case reports and single-center studies have reported off-label treatments and data on their potential effectiveness. Some of these publications have received more attention than others leading to further off-label use. It is important to systematically evaluate all previously used treatments to avoid missing effective options. In this systematic review, we identified 115 reported treatments that have been used off-label or experimentally to treat COVID19; we report an initial assessment of associations with clinically meaningful response. Unsurprisingly, antivirals were the most frequently administered class of treatments. Combination lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 were the most frequent treatments given to all patients. Given the small amount of data and the fact that drugs are often given concurrently or sequentially, we did not seek to compare drugs, but lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2, which had the most amount of data, were each associated with average TCMR of less than 2 weeks.",

Further, this study can inform public health organizations, governments, and treating physicians about treatments that have been used and could be considered in future patients, considering the current absence of randomized controlled trial data. Many of the 76 regimens proposed by the World Health Organization for COVID19 treatment in February 2020, as well as proposed in Chinese governmental guidelines, include treatments found in this study. [3, 5] These drugs were likely often given because they were included in these guidelines. Also, the current case fatality rate of COVID19 is only interpretable in the context of the medical care and treatments provided to patients to date. Some of the most frequently administered treatments in this study could potentially serve as a starting point for a list of essential medicines for resource-limited regions. Lastly, there are a number of high throughput drug screening efforts underway to identify existing drugs that may have activity against SARS-CoV-2.

[7] The potential benefits for these drugs to control or prevent a hyper-immune response must be weighed against the risk of accelerating disease progression by suppressing the immune response. There are also unanticipated effects when treatments are deployed against novel diseases, such as the high incidence of venous thromboembolism with IVIg during the 2003 SARS epidemic. [24] [25] [26] This study provides several other broad insights into COVID19. We observed 55%-to-45% male-to-female ratio in these moderate-to-severe COVID19 cases. A similar pattern was observed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and suspected to be related to protection from sex hormones or differences in the burden of chronic diseases . [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] The average age of 44.4 years is younger than many reports. This may be due to younger patients being more likely to survive a severe presentation and thus more likely to be written up as a case report. Pharmaceutical and traditional Chinese treatments were reported in these publications. [37, 38] We found that drugs classified as herbal and traditional medicine were used in 693 patients (7.6%). Public health organizations have recommended against corticosteroids for COVID19 unless indicated for other conditions, but they were some of the most frequently used treatments in our study.

This sample set is highly skewed towards hospitalized patients and thus is not likely representative of all COVID19 patients, and publication bias is likely. Specifically, physicians tend to write up cases where patients have positive outcomes. Also, physicians with resources to write articles may have more resources available to treat their patients. Mortality was not assessed as the majority of publications did not report survival and many patients were still hospitalized at the time of publication. Instead, we used TCMR. This aggregated outcome helped us to overcome the heterogeneity of outcomes reported across studies. However, we did not consider the concurrent or sequential drug use when associating time to clinically meaningful response. Further, we could not control for the natural history or severity of the disease. These data mostly come from treatment of patients in Asia, and treatment strategies may differ in other regions. Finally, some studies were extracted through translations instead of the full original text. Despite these limitations, this systematic review provides the first broad overview of treatments tried against COVID19 and insights that can inform practicing public health organizations, clinicians, and clinical trial prioritization. Importantly, these data serve as the basis for an updated registry of all treatments reported to be given to COVID19 patients in the published literature (COvid Registry of Off-label & New Agents, CORONA; https://www.med.upenn.edu/CSTL/drugrepurposing.html).",

            "text": "COVID19 represents the largest global pandemic and widespread threat to human health in decades. Fortunately, thousands of drugs are available for other indications and can be used off-label immediately. Unfortunately, no central register of all treatments used for COVID19 exists, so limited data exist on treatment use and activity. Therefore, physicians do not have information on potentially promising treatments and biopharmaceutical companies must make decisions about clinical trials with limited data. We present the first systematic review of treatments used against COVID19. The importance of these data, heterogeneity of the data, and the time and resources required to perform this study emphasize the urgent need for systematic data collection on off-label and experimental treatments against COVID19 as well as randomized controlled trials of promising agents. Learning from this experience to inform future pandemics and aid in the discovery of effective treatments for the approximately 7,000 diseases without treatments is critically important.",

Data on drugs with response times available from at least 10 studies are included. A mean and standard deviation was imputed from summary-level reports with median (interquartile range), and a weighted mean was calculated from available data.
