Rabies virus (RABV) has a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome, and it is a member of the Lyssavirus genus in the Rhabdoviridae family. After a possible incubation in muscles, RABV enters neurons at the wound site, migrates to the central nervous system (CNS) via sensory and motor neurons, and spreads throughout the brain [2]. Once the symptoms appear, there is no effective treatment for rabies. Therefore, exploring potential targets for rabies treatment is very meaningful.",

RABV has been demonstrated to be recognized by innate immune sensors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and induces the production of type I IFN genes (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) in specific cells [5,6]. Type I IFNs bind to their respective receptors, resulting in the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway [7,8]. Type III IFN is structurally and genetically similar to members of the IL-10 family of cytokines. The IFN-\u03bb receptor IL-10R\u03b2 is found in many cells, and the other receptor of IFN-\u03bb, IFNLR1, is expressed preferentially on epithelial cells [9]. While type I and III IFN receptors are distantly related, they both activate the JAK/STAT1-STAT2 transcription factor pathway, which results in the formation of the interferon-sensitive responsive element (ISRE) complex that controls transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to inhibit viral replication [10]. ISGs, including interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 2 and Viperin, play a critical role in limiting RABV replication and spread [11,12,13].",

            "text": "The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is composed of tight junctions between endothelial cells of the CNS microvasculature and astrocyte end-feet. Blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability, an important factor affecting RABV pathogenesis, has been demonstrated to be enhanced in the CNS of RABV-infected mice [14,15,16,17,18]. BBB permeability could increase in response to proinflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IFN-\u03b3, enabling infiltration of immune effectors into the CNS to clear viral infection [19]. Although BBB permeability may be necessary to resist certain CNS infections, it is strictly regulated to avoid neurological damage caused by infiltrated inflammatory cells from the periphery [20]. IFN-\u03bb has been reported to alleviate inflammatory responses during West Nile virus infection by limiting the permeability of the BBB [21]. One of the key mechanisms responsible for BBB breakdown is the damage of tight junctions, which are composed of transmembrane (occludin and claudins) and cytosolic (ZO-1) proteins in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) [22]. IFN-\u03bb signaling in mouse BMECs has been demonstrated to enhance tight junction (TJ) protein localization and prevent the invasion of viruses through the BBB [21]. However, the function of IFN-\u03bb on RABV pathogenesis is unclear. In this study, the role of IFN-\u03bb in RABV infection was investigated, and it was found that IFN-\u03bb could restrict RABV infection by enhancing the expression of ISGs and alleviating inflammation in the CNS by decreasing the BBB permeability.",

The insertion of both genes into the RABV genome was verified by RT-PCR and sequencing (data not shown). To detect whether the rRABVs could express IFN-\u03bb2 or IFN-\u03bb3, NA cells were infected with the rRABVs, and IFN-\u03bb2 or IFN-\u03bb3 were determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 2B, ELISA results indicate that IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 were well expressed in rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 and rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 infected cells, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner, whereas those expressed in B2c did not. Moreover, viral growth curves on BSR, NA, and Vero cells were depicted. As shown in Figure 2C\u2013E, compared with parent virus B2c, more than 10-fold losses of viral titers were observed in rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 infected BSR or NA cells at 72 and 96 hpi, and in rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 infected Vero cells at all tested time points. Additionally, consistent with the results of the growth curve, western blot experiments detecting RABV N protein showed that expression of IFN-\u03bb2 or IFN-\u03bb3 by the rRABVs reduced RABV N protein levels in infected NA cells at 48 hpi (Figure 2F). Furthermore, the effects of expression of IFN-\u03bb2 or IFN-\u03bb3 on virus spread were measured by observing the fluorescence morphologies of rRABV-infected cells and counting the number of RABV-positive cells using fluorescence microscopy. As a result, the fluorescence foci of cells infected with rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 were significantly smaller than those infected with B2c (Figure 2G,H), indicating that expression of IFN-\u03bb suppresses the cell-to-cell spread of RABV.

Furthermore, the mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, STAT1, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), and IFN-inducible GTPase 1 (IIGP1) in different rRABV infected NA cells were detected by qRT-PCR. Significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b14, IFN-\u03b15, IFN-\u03b2, STAT1, IFIT2, and IIGP1 were detected in the cells infected with rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 than those in cells infected with B2c.

Additionally, expression of ISGs (IFIT2 and IIGP1) and activation of JAK-STAT pathway, phosphorylation of STAT1, were also measured by western blotting assay at 24 hpi, and high levels of phosphorylated STAT1, IFIT2 and IIGP1 were detected in rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 infected cell.

Meanwhile, the enhancement of BBB permeability that associated with RABV infection is caused by cytokines and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, as demonstrated in a previous study [16]. To test this hypothesis, six-week-old female BALB/c mice were i.c. infected with rRABVs. To exclude the effect of different virus loads on the regulation of BBB permeability and neuroinflammation, the brains of mice infected by different rRABVs were harvested to analyze viral burden by qRT-PCR. At 3, 6, and 9 dpi, mRNA levels of RABV N were nearly equal in different brain regions of mice infected by B2c, rB2c-IFN\u03bb2, or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 (Figure 7A). Sodium fluorescein was injected into the mice via the tail vein for measurement of BBB permeability. At 3 and 9 dpi, no significant difference in the amount of sodium fluorescein uptake was detected among the three groups. At 6 dpi, leakage of sodium fluorescein from the peripheral circulation into the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem in B2c-infected mice was significantly higher than those in mice infected with rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 (Figure 7B). Moreover, the brain sections were then stained with anti-CD45 antibody to observe and quantify the infiltration of CD45+ cells induced by different rRABVs infection. Less positive signal was observed in different parts of brain from mice infected with rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 than those from mice infected with B2c (Figure 7C). Significantly more CD45+ lymphocytes were found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brain stem from the mice infected with B2c than those infected with rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 at 6 dpi (Figure 7D).

Mouse brain capillary endothelial (b.End3) cells were cultured in the upper chamber of a transwell insert, with supporting astrocytes in the lower chamber. The b.End3 cells were then treated for 24 h with extracts from the supernatants of astrocytes infected with different rRABVs, and the expression of the TJ proteins ZO-1 and occludin were then analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot. Both mRNA (Figure 8A) and protein expression (Figure 8B) of ZO-1 in cells treated with supernatants from B2c-infected astrocytes was significantly lower than that those incubated with the supernatants from rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 infected astrocytes. Additionally, supernatant-treated cells were also stained with anti-ZO-1 polyclonal antibodies and imaged by a laser confocal microscope to assess the integrity of ZO-1. The rB2c-infected astrocytes supernatants caused dissociation of ZO-1, while those treated with rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 infected astrocytes supernatants reduced the effect (Figure 8C,D). To further evaluate the integrity of the endothelial monolayer, FITC-dextran 10,000 was added to the upper chamber of a transwell insert and the fluorescence in the lower chamber was monitored. As shown in Figure 8E, the leakage of FITC-dextran 10,000 was significantly lower when treated with supernatants from rB2c-IFN\u03bb2 or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 infected astrocytes than that treated with B2c infected astrocytes supernatant. These data suggest that IFN-\u03bb maintains the integrity of TJ proteins, resulting in the decrease in the BBB permeability during RABV infection.",

            "text": "IFN-\u03bb signaling through the IFNLR1 receptor on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) induces antiviral effectors such as ISGs via STAT1/STAT2/IRF9-mediated transcription, thereby boosting defenses against intestinal viruses such as rotavirus, reovirus, and norovirus [35,36,37,38]. The neurotropic West Nile virus (WNV) is inhibited in the CNS by IFN-\u03bb through a mechanism that modulates endothelial cell tight junction integrity [21]. In our study, we found that IFN-\u03bb curtails the replication of another neurotropic virus, RABV, in cells. Moreover, IFN-\u03bb also reduces RABV pathogenicity in infected mice by different infection routes, especially i.n. route. IFN-\u03bb has been reported to be particularly important for innate pathogen defense at mucosal barriers [39], which provides a possible explanation for a better survivor rate in rRABV-expressing IFN-\u03bb-infected mice by i.n. route. In addition, IFN-\u03bb is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and its receptor IFNLR1 exhibits a much more tissue-specific expression pattern, with a preference for epithelial cells [10,40]. During intranasal challenge with RABV, the expression of IFNLR1 by nasal epithelial cells is necessary for the responsiveness of the tissue to IFN-\u03bb and the suppression of viral replication in nasal mucosa. Therefore, IFN-\u03bb has evolved as a specific factor that can prevent the invasion of some neurotropic viruses through nasal epithelial cells. The ability of IFN-\u03bb to induce ISG expression in a targeted set of epithelial cells also suggests that IFN-\u03bb promotes a focused antiviral or immunomodulatory response [41,42].",

Cooperation between IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb further increases STAT1/2-activation. In our study, ISRE activity was upregulated by the expression of IFN-\u03bb during RABV infection, indicating that IFN-\u03bb plays a positive role in activating ISRE, which is involved in the downstream production of ISGs [45]. ISGs such as IFIT2 and IIGP1 were reported to restrict RABV replication [13,46].

            "text": "Encephalitis induced by lab-attenuated RABV is characterized by obvious CNS inflammation [18,47,48]. It has previously been reported that RABV induced inflammation in microglia cells mainly through p38 and NF-\u03baB pathways [49]. The results of luciferase reporter assay in our study implied that IFN-\u03bb expression could suitably suppress the activation of NF-\u03baB. Subsequently, production of pro-inflammation cytokines was remarkably decreased, as expected. Consistent with these observations, one previous study showed that excessive expression of IFN-\u03bb caused by IAV infection, whereas the degradation of I\u03baB and the activation of NF-\u03baB was significantly decreased in the infected cells. In contrast, disruption of IFN-\u03bb signaling pathway resulted in the activation of NF-\u03baB [50]. On the other hand, IFN-\u03bb that is induced in DCs and macrophages does not augment proinflammatory cytokine production during viral infection [51]. Type I IFN provides antiviral resistance but also induces proinflammatory responses essential for countering infection [52]. Previous study demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb could upregulate suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, which reduce the devastating effects of excessive inflammation [53]. Consistently, in our study, it was found that IFN-\u03bb could decrease the NF-\u03baB activation and further alleviate inflammation via suppression of neutrophil infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, and VEGF during RABV infection, all of which contribute to BBB breakdown. The role of IFN-\u03bb in NF-\u03baB activation and inflammation production in the context of RABV infection appears to be important, but the detailed mechanism of this process remains to be fully explored.",

Murine IFN-\u03bb2 or IFN-\u03bb3 coding sequences were then inserted into the RABV genome between the G and L genes. (B) Expression of IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 was measured by by ELISA. Briefly, NA cells were infected with B2c, rB2c-IFN\u03bb2, or rB2c-IFN\u03bb3 (MOI = 1, 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001) for 24 h, and the cell culture supernatants were then harvested to determine the quantity of murine IFN-\u03bb2 or IFN-\u03bb3 using a commercial ELISA kit. (C) BSR, NA (D), or Vero cells (E) were infected with different rRABVs at a MOI of 0.01, and multiple-step growth curves were depicted according to the viral titers at different time points. Error bars represent the SE (n = 3). (F) RABV N protein expression in NA cells after infection with rRABVs. N protein was detected by western blot at 48 hpi and ratios of N/\u03b2-actin were calculated using ImageJ. (G) Comparison of the fluorescence morphologies of NA cells infected by different rRABVs at 48 hpi. Twenty fluorescent foci were examined to determine the number of infected cells per fluorescent focus (H). Scale bars represent 200 \u03bcm. Error bars represented the SE (n = 3). The following notations were used to indicate significant differences between groups: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001.",
