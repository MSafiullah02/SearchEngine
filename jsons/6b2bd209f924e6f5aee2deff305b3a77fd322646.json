The mechanism by which IFITM proteins inhibit viral infection is not fully understood, but it has been shown, for example, that these proteins prevent the transfer of viral components to the cytosol by blocking membrane fusion [2] . Influenza A virus replication is persistent and associated with increased cell death and exaggerated proinflammatory responses in the lungs of mice lacking Ifitm3 [3] .",

Individuals with communityacquired pneumonia, H1N1 infection and self-reported Caucasian ancestry were included in the analysis presented here. All of these patients had chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia. None had malignant disease or liver cirrhosis, was receiving systemic steroids, or had significant premorbid exercise restriction. In contrast to the cohort studied by Everitt et al [3] , none of the patients in the GAinS study was pregnant. Only 2 of them had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 5 had asthma. Superadded or concurrent infections were identified in 7 patients (3 with Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each with Staphylococcus hominis, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus). All patients were mechanically ventilated except for 1.",

However, even with the combination of our genotyped patients with H1N1 influenza and the patients with influenza studied by Everitt et al [3] (85% of whom had H1N1 influenza), the number of patients in this study is small and the association relies on only 3 homozygotes genotyped by Everitt et al [3] . Not all of these 3 individuals have undergone population stratification analysis, and given the large differences in the allele frequency of this SNP between populations, population outliers could easily have biased this result.

We find the most significant association with susceptibility to mild influenza infection, in contrast to Zhang et al [7] , who found an association with severe but not mild influenza. The interferonpathway gene IFITM3 therefore seems to act as a susceptibility locus for influenza infection in humans, encompassing both very mild and life-threatening disease. We found no evidence that this SNP is associated with mild bacterial infection, which is unsurprising because IFITM3 has not been implicated in the control of bacterial infection. Although IFITM3 has been shown to mediate infection by multiple viruses, including influenza A, HIV-1, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus [1, 2, [13] [14] [15] , of the pathogens we have studied, the association seemed to be specific for influenza susceptibility.
