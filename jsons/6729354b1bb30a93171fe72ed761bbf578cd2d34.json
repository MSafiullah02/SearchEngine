This novel virus caused severe morbidity and mortality in pregnant women [ 2 -4 ] and younger adults with 87 % of deaths occurring in persons younger than 65 years of age [ 5 ] . In addition to the human toll, annual infl uenza epidemics and pandemics carry substantial economic consequences in health-care utilization costs, intervention costs, and reduced productivity. The cost of annual infl uenza epidemics in the USA is estimated to range between $52 and $199 billion [ 6 ] .",

Infl uenza virologic surveillance throughout the USA is conducted by approximately 140 laboratories comprising the WHO and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks. They collect information on the proportion of infl uenza A and B positive respiratory specimens and determine infl uenza A subtypes. A subset of the infl uenza positive samples, especially if the subtypes cannot be determined by standard diagnostic tests, are sent to CDC for further characterization by gene sequencing to monitor emergence of novel viruses and antiviral resistance [ 23 ] . The second component of the surveillance system is the Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) comprised of approximately 3,000 healthcare providers voluntarily reporting all outpatient visits and the number of visits due to infl uenza-like illness (ILI) stratifi ed by age group. The percentage of weekly ILI visits weighted to refl ect the population size of reporting states are compared to the national baseline of ILI visits outside of infl uenza season to monitor ILI activity levels in each state [ 23 ] . Vital statistics offi ces in 122 participating US cities report the total number of deaths and the number of deaths caused by pneumonia or infl uenza (P&I) stratifi ed by age groups. Statistical methods are used to calculate the weekly level of P&I mortality above the seasonal baseline or epidemic threshold. In 2004, pediatric infl uenza-associated mortality for children 0-18 years of age became a nationally notifi able condition. Infl uenza Hospitalization Network comprised of hospitals in over 80 counties in 14 states collects information from hospital records and reports on laboratory-confi rmed infl uenza hospitalizations for children and adults.

Indication of potential disease outbreak from syndromic surveillance is usually available before laboratory test results are reported [ 14 ] . ESSENCE, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notifi cation of Community-based Epidemics is an example of syndromic surveillance system implemented by the Department of Defense (DoD) to automatically download data from the electronic health records of military personnel and their families. The system captures information coded in accordance with the International Classifi cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifi cation (ICD-9-CM) standards from over 300,000 weekly outpatient visits to US military treatment facilities [ 17 ] . It monitors disease outbreaks based on health care utilization patterns and uses ICD-9-CM codes to group diagnosis into one of the eight disease syndromes. Another national electronic surveillance system, BioSense, launched in 2003 and operated by the CDC collects and analyzes ICD-9-CM coded data from outpatient visits to health-care facilities and emergency departments, hospitalized patients, laboratory tests, and information on over-the-counter medications sold in pharmacies [ 34 ] . Although different studies reported variable utility of syndromic disease surveillance systems for local disease outbreaks, the majority of them indicated that it was useful for monitoring respiratory disease activity and the annual infl uenza seasons [ 19 , 35 , 36 ] . Sensitivity of ICD-9-CM based detectors of acute respiratory disease and infl uenza epidemics varied from 44 to 79 % for acute respiratory disease to 100 % for infl uenza outbreak [ 37 ] and specifi city ranged between 96 and 97 % [ 20 , 27 ] . Sensitivity was found to be moderate and likely not suffi cient to detect a small disease outbreak, e.g., in the event of a local bioterrorism incidence. However, ICD-9-CM coded data can be useful for infl uenza surveillance when accuracy, completeness, and timeliness are carefully considered [ 29 ] before using such data for decision making.",

Hospital based case series studies yield valuable information on risk factors for sever infl uenza during an ongoing or past infl uenza seasons. Although these studies can inform vaccination and therapy decisions, majority of them have a limited sample size, are recourse intensive, and the results are not generalizable on the national level. The lack of this data became especially apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when the disease incidence rate was very high resulting in declaration of phase 6 pandemic while the disease severity on a national level was not ascertained [ 28 ] . Hospital-based electronic surveillance is a cost-effective approach to identify infl uenza season-specifi c populations at high risk for ILI complications and fatal outcomes. Detailed clinical information on each individual case is coded in patients' records and can be used to augment active surveillance in public health response planning and implementation [ 16 ] .",

Increasing utilization of patient electronic records could play an important role in attaining public health objectives and complimenting other information sources. Information from electronic medical records captured through surveillance platforms or stored in local or centralized databases has been used in numerous studies for monitoring disease incidence, prevalence, severity, risk factors, and medical care decisions. Analyses of electronic medical records were employed to augment the traditional approaches [ 17 , 18 ] during respiratory seasons in the USA. Standard surveillance was not suffi cient during the recent infl uenza 2009 H1N1 pandemic when several states, including New York [ 41 ] , Wisconsin [ 42 ] , and California [ 43 ] implemented additional information gathering methods based on electronic medical records to gain a more complete understanding of the ongoing pandemic severity. EHR-based surveillance systems such as Electronic Medical Record Support for Public Health (ESP) implemented in Ohio and Massachusetts and BioSense were successfully used for analyzing ICD-9 diagnosis codes, reporting notifi able disease cases, surveillance of ILI, identifi cation of infl uenza or upper respiratory infection risk factors among hospitalized patients, and for monitoring diabetes prevalence, risk factors, and disease severity [ 13 , 19 ] . The results of infl uenza risk factor analyses based on ICD-9 coded data overall agreed with earlier observations based on primary data collected through the Emerging Infections Program during 2005-2008 infl uenza seasons [ 44 ] and in Manitoba, Canada during 2009 H1N1 pandemic [ 45 ] as well as with laboratory confi rmed infl uenza hospitalizations reported to the CDC during the 2009 pandemic [ 17 , 46 , 47 ] demonstrated that optimally selected ICD-9 code groups can be used in an automated surveillance system drawing information from electronic medical records for accurate monitoring of infl uenza activity. In this study of the US Air Force personnel and their dependents outpatient visits the syndromic surveillance results correlated with the results of sentinel ILI surveillance conducted by the CDC. Placzek and Madoff (2011) used administrative hospital discharge records to estimate the hospitalization rates and characterize patients hospitalized with ILI during the seasonal fl u epidemics and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Massachusetts. They evaluated two sets (\"maximum\" and \"minimum\") of ICD-9 diagnosis codes for their relevance and accuracy in identifying infl uenza-associated hospitalizations and disease severity and concluded the proposed minimum ICD-9 criteria more accurately refl ected the actual infl uenza cases. ICD-9 coded diagnosis alone or in conjunction with other electronic health data were used in monitoring of ILI severity and risk factors [ 18 , 48 , 49 ] , and for modeling early detection of local respiratory disease outbreak [ 24 ] . This approach was adopted for other disease surveillance, such as SARS [ 50 ] , diabetes incidence and management [ 13 ] , and pertussis [ 51 ] . The study results suggest that timely ILI surveillance is feasible using ICD-9-CM coded electronic medical records and emphasized the importance of the appropriate ICD-9-CM code selection for case defi nition for accurate assessment of disease activity and severity [ 18 , 20 ] .",

            "text": "Current infl uenza surveillance systems are resource intensive and provide limited information on patients at-risk for severe infl uenza. To date, no study has been conducted using a large sample of electronic health records (EHR) to examine the risk factors for infl uenza in hospitalized patients across the USA. Larger data sets of EHRs will enable the creation of statistically signifi cant age-specifi c models of infl uenza severity and predict more representative infl uenza risk factors and vulnerable groups. A recent study utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) which is a repository of eight million electronic hospital discharge records from 1,000 participating hospitals in over 43 states representing approximately 20 % of all US hospitalizations [ 7 ] . This data source is maintained by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Results from the retrospective unmatched case-control study of NIS patients hospitalized with infl uenza during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and severe A/H3N2 2007-2008 epidemic seasons confi rmed the utility of using an existing electronic resource to identify comorbidities and demographic risk factors for severity of clinical outcomes associated with pandemic and epidemic infl uenza viruses [ 21 ] . The use of primary diagnosis ICD-9-CM codes 487.xx-488.xx to correctly identify infl uenza hospitalizations from NIS was verifi ed by comparing the temporal trends of monthly hospitalization counts identifi ed in NIS records (Table 29. Findings from these studies demonstrate that large datasets of electronic medical records are an essential component of infl uenza epidemic surveillance. Integration of ICD-9 diagnosis codes into more complex disease detection algorithms can further improve the sensitivity and specifi city of surveillance systems based on electronic medical records [ 52 ] . However, this approach is limited if electronic records are fragmented between different providers using different disease algorithms whereas the ICD-9 codes even though potentially less specifi c are standardized among all users and may be more applicable to nationwide surveillance [ 13 ] . Further standardization of data coding and selection criteria, and interoperability among private and government surveillance efforts has the potential to enhance the electronic data quality and timeliness [ 14 , 18 ] . This methodology can be especially advantageous for public health applications as it uses routinely collected data and requires modest investments for maintenance and operation [ 50 ] .",

Antigenic shift occurs when infl uenza viruses containing diverse HA and NA subtypes coinfect the same host, triggering a reassortment event and producing progeny with genomic segments from both parental viral subtypes [ 53 ] . Wild birds are the natural reservoir for infl uenza viruses. Sixteen hemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase infl uenza A subtypes were isolated from aquatic birds and only the most recent HA17 was isolated from fruit bats [ 60 ] . According to the mixing vessel theory, pigs are considered the main mammalian host where the adaptation of an avian infl uenza viruses to human host and reassortment events occur [ 61 ] . Pigs' cell-receptors match both human and avian infl uenza, rendering them susceptible to infection with viruses from both hosts [ 53 ] . Infl uenza A viruses have been also isolated from other animals, including a horse, dog, cat, tiger, and leopard [ 59 ] .

During seasonal epidemics and pandemics, each case transmits the virus at 2-3 day interval to 1.1-1.8 and 1.5-5.5 individuals respectively [ 65 ] . The human-to-human transmission occurs in one of the three ways: direct contact with infected persons, touching object contaminated with the virus and then transferring it from hands to mucus surfaces of the nose or eyes, and inhaling virus-containing droplets produced by infected person when coughing or sneezing [ 66 , 67 ] . The effi ciency of infl uenza transmission aerosolized in droplets depends on the size of the droplet, viral concentration, and humidity. Yang and Marr (2011) demonstrated that the concentration of infectious infl uenza virus in cough droplets is inversely related to the relative humidity (RH) in indoor settings, while the droplet size is directly related to relative humidity. In a dryer environment, the smaller droplets tend to stay in the air longer, infecting larger number of sensitive hosts. In a humid environment, the virus in large droplets settles on objects (fomites) and can survive for several days. Viable infl uenza viruses in mucus were detected on paper money bills after 48 h and in some cases up to 17 days [ 68 ] .",

Multiple reasons for this periodicity such as sunlight, temperature, humidity, human mobility, and contact rates, and functions of the immune system have been explored without arriving at a defi nitive conclusion [ 69 , 70 ] . Yang and Marr (2011) suggested that the winter seasonality can be partially explained by higher concentration of droplet-suspended infl uenza viruses in heated buildings due to lower humidity. Other environmental factors, such as colder temperature and reduced ultraviolet radiation, are also independently associated with virus survival and seasonality. Temperature and humidity also effect the human immune system, diminishing the blood fl ow and leukocyte supply in low temperatures while increasing viral shedding [ 69 ] . Lowen and Palese (2011) confi rmed that cold and dry conditions facilitated viral transmission through aerosolized droplets, while warm or humid environment (30 \u00b0C, 80 % RH) prevented the viral spread. They proposed that seasonal pattern of infl uenza epidemics in temperate climate occurs due to viral transmission by aerosolized droplets, while year-round infections occur through fomites or direct contacts in tropical climate. The exception to this pattern was the 2009 spring outbreak of the swine-origin infl uenza A H1N1, which possibly could be explained by the increased frequency of transmission via direct contact due to the absence of human immunity to the novel antigenic strain. Variations in temperature and humidity did not affect viral spread by direct contact [ 66 ] .",

Crowded conditions, increased stress, and malnutrition could have weakened the immune system of the troops while increased travel of the armed forces and civilians facilitated the spread of the virus throughout the world [ 75 ] .",

Infl uenza virus infection is known to exacerbate asthma and asthma is a known risk factor for infl uenza infection. It was the most frequently reported underlying medical condition in pediatric deaths associated with infl uenza A/2009 H1N [ 83 ] . The impact of asthma may also depend on the circulating infl uenza viruses. In a Canadian studies of pediatric population hospitalized with infl uenza, children with pandemic H1N1 infl uenza in 2009 were signifi cantly more likely to have asthma (22 %) than those with seasonal infl uenza during the 2004-2009 seasons (6 %) although there were no difference in severity or clinical presentation of asthma between the pandemic and seasonal pediatric infl uenza cases [ 108 ] . Asthma was also more prevalent among the children admitted to ICU with pH1N1 and developing pH1N1-associated pneumonia compared with seasonal infl uenza in 2006-2009 [ 109 ] . Patients with chronic lung and airways diseases such as COPD are at a greater risk for severe morbidity and mortality associated with infl uenza infection. Evidence suggests that bacterial coinfections in COPD cases may further impact the disease severity. In a study of patients hospitalized with severe COPD in Italy, viral infection was detected in 23.4 % and viral-bacterial coinfection in 25 % of patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbation. Infl uenza was one of the most frequently identifi ed infections adversely effecting lung function and extending hospital stay [ 110 ] . Although many national guidelines recommend infl uenza vaccination, there is only limited evidence that vaccine is effective in COPD patients. However, some observational studies suggest that vaccine reduces both hospitalizations and mortality [ 111 ] .",

            "text": "The association between obesity and infection can be explained by impaired immune response or by strain of infection on respiratory system and reduced mechanical function of lungs and airways. Obese persons consume high percentage of oxygen to maintain normal respiratory function; they have increased airway resistance and may suffer from hypoventilation and chronic infl ammation of the respiratory tract altering the immune function and the ability to respond to challenges to respiratory system [ 119 , 120 ] . The role of obesity as an independent risk factor may be diffi cult to ascertain, especially in studies with a limited sample size, as it is often directly correlated with other underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) known to increase risk for infl uenza infections and severe outcomes [ 118 ] . However, because more than 35 % of adults in the USA [ 121 ] and 500 million worldwide [ 122 ] are obese it may be a major contributor to excess morbidity and mortality associated with infl uenza and warrants further investigation. Pregnancy has been reported as a risk factor for seasonal and pandemic infl uenza infections and severe disease outcomes using historical and current data. About 50 % of pregnant women infected with infl uenza developed pneumonia during the 1918 and 1957 pandemics [ 123 ] . Pregnancy was reported to be a risk factor for infection with infl uenza and severe disease outcome during the infl uenza A/2009 H1N1 pandemic as well. In a review of publications on 2009 H1N1 pandemic epidemiology in the Northern Hemisphere, reported that 4.5-17.4 % of hospitalized cases were pregnant women and they comprised 11.5-18.2 % of ICU admissions. Compared to nonpregnant women diagnosed with infl uenza, they were seven times more likely to be hospitalized and twice more likely to have fatal outcomes [ 99 ] . In a UK study of a population with an estimated 6 % prevalence of pregnancy, 21 % of patients hospitalized with laboratory confi rmed infl uenza 2009 H1N1 were pregnant and the majority of them were in the second or third trimester. The case fatality rate ranged between 1 and 6 % [ 2 ] . The rate of respiratory hospitalizations among pregnant women in Nova Scotia during non-pandemic infl uenza seasons between 1990 and 2002 was almost 8 times higher for pregnant women than the year before they became pregnant [ 124 ] . Pregnant women with comorbidities such as asthma, anemia, and heart or renal disease were at the greatest risk for infl uenza-associated hospitalization.",

Interestingly, in a study of ILI hospitalized patients during the 2007-2010 infl uenza seasons, pregnancy was protective against pneumonia (OR 0.4), possibly due higher likelihood of hospitalizing pregnant women with severe respiratory infection [ 125 ] . This observation was supported by a UK study reporting that maternal outcomes were no more severe that for nonpregnant women of similar age hospitalized for infl uenza [ 2 ] . An increased susceptibility to infl uenza infection and severe disease among pregnant women could be partially explained by changes in immune response due to lower plasma levels of adiponectin regulating macrophage activity [ 119 ] . An additional explanation could be psychosocial changes that may occur during pregnancy such as perceived increased stress, anxiety, and negative mood which also were shown to alter the immune functions and increase the risk for respiratory tract infections [ 126 ] .",

Persons younger than 65 years of age accounted for a greater proportion of deaths during all three pandemics in the twentieth century as well as during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when young adults were at an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Age was an independent risk factor for severe disease outcomes and death. In a study of hospitalized infl uenza cases in Washington State the odds of ICU admission or death were 4.4 and 5.9 times greater among adults 18-49 years and 50-64 years of age respectively compared with children younger than 18 years when controlling for other risk factors [ 11 ] . The lower infl uenza incidence rate and mortality among adults over 64 years observed during pandemics could be explained by antigen recycling mechanism, a partial protection due to earlier exposure to a similar virus [ 65 ] . However, if infected, this age group had the highest mortality rate among the hospitalized patients [ 99 ] potentially due to the presence of comorbidities, effect of medications, and bacterial coinfections. Explanations for severe disease among young adults included antibody-dependent enhanced infection and strong infl ammatory response in the lungs leading to lung injury and ARDS [ 11 ] . Once infected with a novel infl uenza virus younger persons may retain long-lasting immunity better than older persons [ 130 ] .",

For the 2009 infl uenza pandemic, the overall difference in demographic and clinical factors between the disease severity groups and moderate disease controls suggests that age, sex, race, and all clinical conditions of interest showed overall statistically signifi cant association with infl uenza severity. However, pregnancy was not associated with infl uenza severity for women of childbearing age [ 21 ] . The differences of risk factors and clinical outcomes in different countries further highlighted the need for country-specifi c and global surveillance as well as data sharing internationally [ 99 ] .",

Susceptibility to infl uenza and severity of the disease is affected by multiple factors including characteristics of the circulating virus strain, genetics of the host, prior infection history, comorbidities, age, and environmental factors. The unpredictability of the virus-host interactions and consequences to population's health underscores the need for continuous timely and informative infl uenza surveillance. Clinical surveillance is critical for identifi cation of at risk population groups which also may change depending on the circulating virus as well as for monitoring the disease spread in the population and severity. Syndromic surveillance based on nonclinical indicators may contribute to a signal of epidemic spread and increase of cases. To better predict viral strains for effective vaccines and monitor novel emerging viral strains that could cause epidemics it is critical to continue and expand viral surveillance on an International level. While electronic surveillance based on nonclinical data such as over-the-counter medication sales, school absenteeism, and health information seeking may provide preliminary signs of potential infection spread, prompt release of electronic health records (EHR) containing diagnosis and clinical outcomes can lead to a more informative and timely disease surveillance. Increasing utilization of patient electronic records could play an important role in attaining public health objectives and complimenting other information sources.",
