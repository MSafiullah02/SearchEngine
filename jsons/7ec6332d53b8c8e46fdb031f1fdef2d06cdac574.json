As shown in Figure 1 , the increasing trend of hospitalized cases over a short period of time (19 February to March 11) is clear. This finding could confirm the rapid spread of the disease in the population. The peak of hospitalization occurred on March 11, and since March 17, the number of hospitalized cases has decreased slightly. The data appear to indicate a propagated source pattern of spread. Estimates suggest that around 14% of people infected with COVID-19 have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill [13] , hence, about 20% of all cases of the disease are usually need to be hospitalized. Since Baqiyatallah Hospital is a referral center in Tehran, so, it can be concluded that there is probably a similar trend in the general population. Among the 239 deaths, a majority (160 = 66.94%) has been \u226560 years of age and 38(15.89%) had comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases and etc. According to the results of our study, overall CFR was calculated to be 1.85% based on the total number of patients (both outpatient and inpatient). Other studies have been reported CFR ranged from 2.5% to 3%, [14, 15] . CFR was also calculated to be 8.06% among hospitalized patients, it is not surprising that the CFR among hospitalized patients was high as patients with a better general condition who were not hospitalized and therefore not included in the denominator. A recently published systematic review and meta-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f analysis reports a CFR of over 13% in 7 studies describing 632 hospitalized patients [16] . Also, two studies from China, reported a CFR of 15% [8] and 11% [9] , respectively. Besides, in a study the CFR has been reported to be as high as 49% among critical hospitalized cases [17] . The results of logistic regression showed the significant effects of age , male gender and underlying diseases on risk of death in patients with COVID-19. In line with other studies [18, 19] the regression analysis in our study revealed that older age is associated with higher risk of mortality. Some studies showed that older age is associated with declined immune system ability [20] . Previously, older age has been reported as an associated factor for mortality in SARS [21] and MERS [22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "(19", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 695, "end": 699, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1328, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1332, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1756, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1814, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1826, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1948, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2137, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2141, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2333, "end": 2337, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2426, "end": 2430, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2440, "end": 2444, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 199, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The present study showed that male gender significantly increases mortality (OR=1.45, 95% CI:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "1.08-1.96).

This finding is consistent to other studies [9, 25] . The less susceptibility to infection among women could be attributed to the X chromosome and sex hormones, which have been reported to play role in innate and adaptive immunity [26] . Furthermore, according to our results, 10.89% of patients had chronic underlying diseases, mainly diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases , hypertension and cardiovascular diseases; this is similar to MERS-CoV [24] . In line with other studies [27] [28] [29] , our result also showed that, having comorbidities had a statistically significant effect on Mortality (OR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.24). A study suggested that compared to patients with no comorbidities, the risk of death in patients with influenza is more than in those who had cardiovascular disease and hypertension [30] .
