Firstly, the disease is caused by a new member of the family Coronaviridae, with distinctive properties, setting it apart from the two other coronaviruses that are already known to cause the common cold in human beings.1 Secondly, during its early emergence, it infected many healthcare workers (HCWs), including the index case from Guangdong, who transmitted the infection to individuals coming from different parts of the world.2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8. Thirdly, it is the first global epidemic of a new emerging infection, which has been managed at an international level using the latest technology available as is described in the following: (a) the internet for rapid, 24 h communication across all affected countries and time zones to exchange clinical and technical information;9., 10., 11. (b) modern virological methods including both traditional whole animal/cell culture and electron microscopy,12., 13. and the newer molecular biological techniques that enabled the whole genetic sequence of the new virus to be obtained within 2 months of the onset of the global epidemic;14., 15. and (c) the rapid investigation of compounds for possible active agents to treat or immunize against the new illness.16., 17., 18., 19., 20., 21., 22., 23., 24., 25., 26., 27.\n",

            "text": "It is thought that SARS CoV is a zoonotic virus, and studies of Guangdong wildlife are ongoing at present to determine its origin.35., 36. The hypothesis is that due to the wide variety of exotic wild animals that are consumed as food delicacies in Guangdong province, in Southern China, the transmission of SARS CoV from animal to man occurred during capture, handling, preparation or consumption of these animals. This was supported by anecdotal reports that some patients, who had SARS in Guangdong Province in November and December of 2002, reported a history of occupational exposure to these exotic wild animals. Interestingly, two out of the recent four cases of SARS occurring early in 2004 had documented exposure to civet cats in a restaurant serving exotic wild animals and environmental samples taken from that restaurant were positive for SARS-CoV genome by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This has lead to the subsequent cull on these animals recently initiated by China.37., 38. A comparison can be drawn with other zoonotic viruses such as influenza, and Nipah virus, which have also recently emerged from the region of Southeast Asia.39., 40. Current animal candidates for the natural reservoir of SARS CoV include the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) and the racoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides).35., 36. There has also been a suggestion that the black rat (Rattus rattus) may also play a role as a vector.41 The identification of the natural reservoir for the new SARS CoV has important practical public health implications because once it has been identified, it may be possible to limit the exposure and thus prevent further transmissions to susceptible people, thus minimizing the risk of another SARS epidemic. An interesting finding for SARS CoV strains isolated from the civet cat species was that the genome sequence was 29 nucleotide bases longer than the SARS CoV isolated from human SARS cases. It was suggested by the authors who reported this finding that this implied that it was therefore more likely that the virus had passed from civet cat to man, rather than vice versa.36\n",

These estimates have deliberately omitted the so-called \u2018super-spreader\u2019 cases, which initiated the major epidemics in the severely affected countries. On this basis, SARS is not as infectious as measles, mumps, rubella, or influenza,57 but it was the close proximity of HCWs to their patients, which gave rise to the high rate of HCW infections in the early part of the epidemic, before personal protective equipment (PPE) was widely used in hospitals.",

All staff dealing with suspect, probable or confirmed SARS patients, as defined by the WHO63 (summarized in Table 2\n), should wear PPE consisting of at least: a mask of minimum N95 or P100/FFP3, or P99/FFP2 specification, a single pair of gloves, eye protection, a disposable gown, an apron and easily decontaminated footwear, as recommended by the WHO.64 All staff should be trained to remove such PPE carefully without contaminating hands or clothes, with careful hand washing before, and after the use of such PPE. However, the effective use of PPE depends on thorough staff training, diligence and motivation, and where this is lacking, breakthrough infections occur.65\n",

This is because the spectrum of SARS illness can range from mild to severe and may well not be present initially as a respiratory complaint. Also, there have been reports of afebrile cases of SARS occurring in the elderly (see below). This situation was encountered by Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, and consequently all HCWs working in the hospital building wore PPE of some kind, usually, at least a surgical-style mask. In Hong Kong, guidelines also graded the PPE to be used depending on the areas of highest risk for encountering/managing SARS patients, from simply a surgical mask in low-risk areas to full gown, cap, gloves, N95 mask and face visor for high-risk areas or procedures, managing patients with fever with or without respiratory symptoms.67 Moreover, a single room with negative pressure was dedicated for aerosol-generating procedures such as taking nasopharyngeal aspirate, bronchoscopy and intubation, but the use of powered-air-purifying respirators (PAPR) was not routinely recommended. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority have also set a three-grade alert system (Green\u2013Yellow\u2013Red) dependent on whether active SARS cases are present in the local community or globally, and each grade has different implications for hospital infection control policy. In Singapore, in addition, they used PAPR hoods for such high-risk procedures (personal communication, Tang Ong Teng, Singapore General Hospital; Leong Hoe Nam, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore). A study by Derrick and Gomersall68 demonstrated that PAPR was also superior to standard surgical helmets that do not filter air through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. In Toronto, full body suits (Stryker T4) and PAPR were both available.61 Ultimately, the cost vs. benefit of such equipment (particularly the PAPR hoods and suits) will have to be decided locally. Of course, the PPE available in each healthcare facility not only hospitals but also nursing/residential homes and general practice surgeries would depend on the perceived risk of encountering SARS patients. This in turn depends on whether SARS CoV is circulating in the local community or among returning travellers from endemic or epidemic areas with SARS-compatible symptoms.",

Viral genome can also be detected from stool samples107., 110., 112. and also from blood samples taken during the first few days of the illness.113., 114., 115. The level of virus in urine is too low for a reliable diagnosis. There are now commercial kits available for RT-PCR testing, which are becoming more sensitive and specific, and can give rapid results that will be clinically useful if they confirm the presence of SARS CoV, though false-positive results are possible, and a negative result cannot exclude a diagnosis of SARS. Other diagnostic tests include antibody tests (serology) for SARS CoV, which can be immunofluorescence format,12., 13., 116. or enzyme-liked immunoassay (EIA) format.117., 118.\n",
