            "text": "It is well known that travelers are more likely to be killed or injured in accidents or through violence than to die from an infectious disease. Whilst the literature reveals that 15% to 54% of travelers experience health problems, injuries were responsible for over 50%, assault for 3.8% and drowning for 11.5% to 14% of traveler mortality. The paucity of reliable data is a major problem in developing countries. In addition to the increasing importance of violence and terrorism in developing countries, the number of road vehicle accidents during travel outside Europe increases by about 5% every year. Fatalities occur in 1.4 per 10,000 motor vehicles in the UK per year, but in 9 to 67 per 10,000 in Asia and in 20 to 118 in Africa. The most dangerous form of travel in the world is the minibus, followed by motorbike, bicycle, walking and automobile. In South Africa more than 900 persons die in 60,000 accidents involving minibuses. Major risk factors for accidents are the use of alcohol, lack of infrastructure, non-compliance and poor quality medical care. Absence of helmets, fatigue and unfamiliarity with traffic resulted in a significant excess of travelers compared to locals involved in accidents. More men than women have accidents. The incidence of serious injuries in adventure tourists is shown to be very low, mostly occurring in activities involving the risk of falling from a moving vehicle or in sporting pursuits using animals. The causes of accidents were most commonly related to the client and his failure to attend to and follow instructions. Travel medicine advisors should warn travelers of all these hazards and of any specific local conditions prevailing at certain destinations. Counseling should address alertness, avoidance of dark or \"red light\" areas and following safety recommendations. Prevention should include the use of safety belts and helmets, a check up of the car/motorbike and the avoidance of the major road traffic injury causes mentioned above. The importance of packing a first aid kit and instruction how to use it should be explained to travelers to developing countries. Most important, special focus should be on the travel health insurance. A large study in World Bank staff and consultants showed that the rates of insurance claims were 80% higher for men and 18% higher in women travelers versus their non-traveling counterparts. Because of the costs of medical treatment abroad and the high cost associated with aeromedical evacuation, all travelers should be advised to read their policies carefully to see what is covered and to check for any exclusions. An international outbreak of meningococcal disease occurred in association with the Hajj pilgrimage in the years 2000 and 2001. This outbreak generated particular interest as the outbreak strain was W135, a previously rare serogroup. Several reports from all over the world have shown that this strain not only affected pilgrims but also household contacts of returning pilgrims and the community at large, with the potential of non-Hajj related further epidemics. A switch from the bivalent meningococcal vaccine against serogroups A and C was recommended for the year 2001 Hajj and obligatory for the year 2002 Hajj. Immunisation with polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine, however, does not prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci which is the primary source of transmission. A prospective study in Singaporean pilgrims before and after the Hajj 2001 demonstrated a high acquisition rate of meningococcal carriage (from 0.5% to 17%); the predominant serogroup was W135. Subsequent transmission of this W135 clone from returning pilgrims to household contacts was found to be 13%. The estimated clinical attack rate in contacts was 28 per 100,000. Public health measures need to be in place to protect household contacts.",

            "text": "Meanwhile N. meningitidis W135 has gone far beyond the Hajj pilgrimage and has reached epidemic dimensions in the Greater Lake Area in Africa since the beginning of 2002. Therefore, travelers to Africa should be vaccinated with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine which also covers W135. A recent thought provoking article by Schwartz et al. in the NEJM questions the appropriateness of our current recommendations for the prevention of travelers' malaria. Surveillance data on imported US and Israeli cases with species specification were collated and analysed. Some 45% of total Israeli cases and 35% of total US cases were classified as \"late onset malaria\", defined as occurring later than 2 months after leaving the malaria endemic area. Most of these late onset cases were due to P. vivax, occasionally to P. ovale and rarely to P. malariae. In the Israeli data no late onset cases were attributed to P. falciparum but 5% of the US late onset cases identified P. falciparum as the causative species. Of concern is that 81% of the Israeli and 62% of the US late onset malaria patients claimed to have complied with the recommended chemoprophylaxis. Are our national recommendations ineffective or inappropriate? Is the threat of P. vivax malaria ignored? The authors of this paper correctly point out that currently used chemoprophylactic agents, mefloquine, doxycycline and chloroquine are blood schizontocides that have little or no activity on the liver stages of the parasite particularly on the liver hypnozoite or dormant stage (occurring in P. vivax and P. ovale). The newer anti-malaria agent atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone) is a blood schizontocide but also a causal agent and effective against the liver phase of P. falciparum but its efficacy against the liver stages of P. vivax needs clarification. To date primaquine is the recognised drug for the radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale hypnozoites but post travel treatment with this agent is complicated and fraught with poor compliance. The authors suggest that new agents are needed that focus on the liver stages of Plasmodium. ",
