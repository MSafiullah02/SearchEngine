My Hospital is normally solely an Orthopaedic Hospital specialising in elective surgeries (arthroplasty, spine, sports med.,\u2026). It is located in Bavaria, the state in Germany with the highest number of Covid-19 patients of all German states. The situation in Germany differs at that time from the situation in other EU countries, like Italy, Spain or France. Although Germany has the third highest number of Covid-19 positive patients in the EU, we still have a relatively low number of deaths (around 1.5 %) compared to the other countries (8-10%). This is more or less demonstrating that a lot of tests have been performed compared to the other countries and that in the beginning more young people were affected. The percentage might change within the next weeks as now also a lot of older patients in nursing homes are tested positive. The number of Covid-19 patients in ICU is still increasing every day, however, we still have enough ICU capacity left and scenarios like in other countries have not happened in Germany so far. However, it is still far too early for giving an all-clear. Therefore, most of us still watch the daily numbers of new infections, doubling time, and patients in ICU and hope that the curve is flattening further.",

Emergency control, for example, appointed a medical leader in every county in order to coordinate patient flow, beds, protective material and ventilators. All free beds, and in particular all free ICU beds need to be reported online, every day, at a predefined time. Based on those numbers the patient flow is optimized and the collaboration between counties and states organised. This also allows to move patients from one Hospital group to another, something that would be impossible outside of a crisis. However, only with all these regulations, areas with higher patient numbers can be relieved and units in lesser affected areas of the country can actually support the system.",

This is nothing to get depressed about, it is just a fact. As an Orthopaedic surgeon we can deliver very substantial pain reduction and gain of function, our duty is to improve quality of life not to save lives. So now, in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis, our role as a surgeon has been cut back to a minimum, only trauma cases, infections and acute pain exacerbation that doesn\u2019t respond to pain medication are left for us to treat. In my Hospital that is less than 15% of my cases.",

The shutdown, has demonstrated that the vast majority of patients have a relative indication and in difficult times the acceptance of pain and reduction in mobility is higher, too.",

All team members were informed and trained on those guidelines, however, with the increasing number of Covid-19 positive patients and employees the number of contact persons who also needed to be quarantined became so high, that a routine shift sometimes was not possible.

As for most senior surgeons, the time of working in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and dealing with critically ill patients was long ago, the role of the Orthopaedic Surgeons now is more an assisting than a leading one.

Due to the interactive part, questions and answers can be addressed in a standard manner.
