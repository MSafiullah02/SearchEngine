Ad vectors have been developed for gene therapy purposes with the aim of treating inherited or acquired diseases [5]. However, the high immunogenicity of E1-deleted Ad recombinants excluded their successful use for sustained gene therapy and led to their development as vaccine carriers [6]. Ad vaccines have been shown to induce the highest B- and CD8+ T-cell responses in experimental animals, including rodents [7], [8], canines [9], and primates [10], [11], [12] and have been tested in human clinical trials for antigens of HIV-1 [13]. Ad vectors are being evaluated in additional clinical trials using DNA vaccine priming regimens followed by Ad vector booster immunizations [14].",

These include the inability to transduce certain target cell populations, an acute Ad mediated toxicity in vivo, and most importantly the high prevalence of hAd5 vector neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) within the human population which decrease gene transfer efficiency or blunt vaccine potency. In fact, subgroup C (which includes hAd2 and hAd5) adenoviral infection is endemic in the human population and consequently, the majority of humans seroconvert within the first 5 years of life as the result of natural infections. In the United States, depending on the age of the study population and the sensitivity of the assay, 40\u201360% of humans carry readily detectable VNAs to hAd5 virus [8]. Seroprevalence rates to hAd5 virus are markedly higher in human populations from developing countries [8]. In animal models, including non-human primates (NHPs), VNAs generated upon pre-exposure to hAd5 virus have been shown previously to strongly impair the B- and T-cell responses to the transgene product of a vaccine based on an E1-deleted Ad of the same serotype [15], [16], [17]. A similar impairment was observed in human volunteers in a clinical trial with a hAd5 vaccine to HIV-1 [18].",

            "text": "In order to overcome these problems, different strategies are being pursued. These include immunosuppression [19], [20], artificial envelopment with lipid bilayers [21], use of different human Ad serotypes [22], [23], retargeting of human vectors by masking the adenoviral fiber knob to ablate binding to the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) [24], targeting specific cell receptor by genetic modification of hAd fiber [25], [26] and vector encapsulation into microparticles [27]. Vectors based on human non-subgroup C adenovirus have been previously reported [22]. Among them, hAd35 has been proposed as an alternative to hAd5 for vaccine delivery because of its low seroprevalence: comparison of hAd5- and hAd35-based vectors in mice and non-human primates showed a lower immunological potency of the latter vector [28], [29]. Similarly, two other vectors based on the rare serotypes hAd24 and hAd34 induced lower CMI than hAd5 in non-human primates [30]. Additionally, use of non-human Ads as vectors to elude hAd immunity has been proposed (reviewed in [31]). Several non-human Ads are naturally non-pathogenic to humans and have been well characterized and unlike human Ads, it is expected that immunity to non-human adenoviruses will not be prevalent in the human population. It has been shown that pre-existing humoral immunity in humans did not cross-neutralize ovine [32], chimpanzee [33], [34], [35], [36], canine [37], [38] or porcine Ads [39].",

In fact, one of the major obstacles to achieving a tumor-specific immune response is that of overcoming central and/or peripheral T cell tolerance against TAAs and inducing CTLs that could effectively eradicate disseminated tumor metastases and subsequently maintain a long lasting immunological memory, preventing tumor recurrence [40]. Ad have been shown to be efficacious vaccine vectors able to break immune tolerance to target antigens in human TAA transgenic mice [41], [42], [43], [44] as well as in non-human primates [45]. Increasingly, combinations of Ad vectors with heterologous modalities of immunization, such as in vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA (DNA-EP) induce superior immune responses compared to single modality vaccines [41], [45], [46].",

Briefly, 2 \u00d7 106 to 1.5 \u00d7 107 viral particles of hAd5 expressing secreted alkaline phosphatase (hAd5-SEAP) were diluted in 100 \u03bcl of complete cell medium and added to an equal volume of mouse serum diluted in complete medium. Each serum sample was tested at various dilutions. Samples were pre-incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and then added to 293 cells seeded into 96 wells (3 \u00d7 104 cells/well). The inoculum was then removed and cells re-fed with fresh medium. 24 h later, 50 \u03bcl of medium was removed and SEAP activity was measured by a chemiluminescent assay (Phospha-Light System\u2122, Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) according to manufacturer instructions. The neutralization titer is defined as the dilution of serum giving a 50% reduction of the SEAP activity observed in the positive control with the virus alone.",

However, pre-existing anti-adenovirus immunity and, in particular, neutralizing antibodies which reduce cell uptake of the adenoviral vectors can significantly dampen vaccine responses and represent a major limitation to the successful use of common serotypes of adenovirus.",

Recent studies have shown that Ad can also use other receptors, such as the major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI) and heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycans [59]. Gene transfer efficacy mediated by hAd5 and ChAd3 has been investigated in a large panel of human primary cells of different tissue origin and found to be similar (Colloca et al., in preparation). This suggested that both vectors utilize the same entry mechanisms, at least in in vitro cultured cells. However, expression of CEA was apparently lower in ChAd3-CEA i.m. injected mice (Fig. 2B), suggesting that this vector may have different properties and/or tropism in transducing mouse tissues compared to hAd5 [60], [61].",
