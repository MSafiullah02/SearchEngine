            "text": "The robust and consistent expression of the CD13 cell surface marker on very early as well as differentiated myeloid hematopoietic cells has prompted numerous investigations seeking to define roles for CD13 in myeloid cells. To address the function of myeloid CD13 directly, we created a CD13 null mouse and assessed the responses of purified primary macrophages or DCs from WT and CD13 null animals in cell assays and inflammatory disease models, where CD13 has been implicated previously. We find that mice lacking CD13 develop normally with normal hematopoietic profiles except for an increase in thymic but not peripheral T cell numbers. Moreover, in in vitro assays, CD13 appears to be largely dispensable for the aspects of phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen presentation that we tested, although we observed a slight decrease in actin-independent erythrocyte uptake. However, in agreement with our published studies, we show that lack of monocytic CD13 completely ablates anti-CD13-dependent monocyte adhesion to WT endothelial cells. In vivo assessment of four inflammatory disease models showed that lack of CD13 has little effect on disease onset or progression. Nominal alterations in gene expression levels between CD13 WT and null macrophages argue against compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, al-though CD13 is highly expressed on myeloid cells and is a reliable marker of the myeloid lineage of normal and leukemic cells, it is not a critical regulator of hematopoietic development, hemostasis, or myeloid cell function.

This and subsequent workshops assigned leukocytebinding mAb to groups termed \"clusters of differentiation\", or CD antigens, by virtue of common patterns of binding to panels of primary hematopoietic cells and cell lines. In this way, the CD13 cell surface molecule was defined as a marker of cells of the myeloid lineage in normal and leukemic cells. Subsequent molecular cloning of the CD13 cDNA showed that it was identical to the membrane-tethered peptidase APN [2] and was expressed on cells, in addition to those of the hematopoietic system, such as the epithelial cells of the renal proximal tubules and the intestinal brush border, cells of the brain, fibroblasts, and activated endothelial cells [3] .",

            "text": "CD13 is a large 150-kD type II protein with a short cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a large extracellular domain containing its enzymatic activity. As an extracellular peptidase, CD13 functions to cleave single neutral amino acids from the N terminus of small peptides, and therefore, its substrates and functions vary depending on the tissue where it is expressed. For example, in the brain, CD13 cleaves opioid peptides and enkephalins to regulate neuronal signaling, and in the intestine, it cleaves peptides to facilitate amino acid resorption [3] . The persistent and specific myeloid expression of CD13 on normal cells of the hematopoi-etic lineage has prompted numerous studies that have implicated CD13 in a variety of myeloid cell functions, primarily in assays that correlate CD13 expression with a particular function, inhibit enzymatic activity with chemical inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies, or activate CD13 using ligand-mimicking cross-linking antibodies. To address the function of CD13 directly and genetically, we created a global KO of CD13 and tested these animals for phenotypic effects on a number of myeloid functions attributed previously to CD13, such as myeloid differentiation, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and inflammatory processes. We find that CD13 expression is dispensable for hematopoietic development and physiologic homeostasis and suggest that its function in myeloid cells may be dependent specifically on particular immune challenges to generate cross-linking ligands.",

We constructed a floxed CD13-targeting construct with the frtneo-frt region using recombineering methods [5] with the assistance of the GTTF (UCHC, Farmington, CT, USA). The schematic of the targeting strategy is depicted below (see Fig. 1 ). The targeting vector was electroporated into the murine ES cell line D from the (129SvEvTac)/Cb7BL/6J mouse strain, and neomycin-resistant colonies containing the targeting constructs were expanded and transferred into pseudopregnant females, resulting in chimeric mice containing the targeted CD13 allele. Germ-line transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed, and the neo cassette was excised to produce mice carrying a floxed CD13 allele. Finally, floxed CD13 animals were mated with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the ubiquitous Hprt gene promoter (129S1-Hprt1 tm1(cre)Mnn /J, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to produce the global CD13 null strain. The CD13 global KO animals have been backcrossed subsequently to the C57Bl/6 strain, and experiments described in this report were performed with CD13 ko/ko and control mice (CD13 wt/wt ) backcrossed for at least six generations to the C57BL/6J strain (Jackson Laboratory). The mice were housed in the animal facilities at the UCHC in accordance with Institutional and Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare guidelines. CD13 deletion was assessed using PCR genotyping, mRNA expression analysis (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric analysis (described below).",

The mCD13 gene is encoded by 20 exons spanning nearly 40 kB on chromosome 7. A BAC containing the CD13 gene identified by BLAST analysis was obtained from the CHORI BAC repository and confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Repeated attempts to target the 5\u0408-most region of the CD13 gene resulted in no recombinants and prompted the revised strategy depicted in Figure 1A , where LoxP recombination sites were inserted in introns between exons 3 and 4 and 13 and 14. Exposure of this construct to the cre recombinase would result in a gene lacking exons 4 -13, which encode the enzymatic active site, the putative NGR-binding site [10] , and the majority of the extracellular portion of the molecule. In addition, splicing between exons 3 and 14 introduces a frame-shift resulting in a stop codon early in exon 14, which would be predicted to produce a protein lacking exons 4 -20 (as depicted in Fig. 1B) . We have observed that relatively slight modifications to the CD13 protein severely impair its trafficking to the cell surface and would predict that the large alteration induced by this deletion would similarly affect cell surface expression. Indeed, transfection of the C33a human epithelial cell line with a mutant V5-tagged CD13 expression construct lacking exons 4 -20 showed no cell surface expression of the V5 tag (Fig. 1C) . Transfection of murine ES cells with the targeting construct resulted in five founder lines in the C57Bl/6 \u03eb 129 mixed background, and one 6H11 was expanded for further study. After germ-line transmission was confirmed, the mice were crossed to a transgenic strain expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the ubiquitous HPRT promoter on a mixed background to create global CD13 null animals. Homozygous KOs were healthy and fertile with no overt phenotypic or serologic abnormalities (data not shown), consistent with an independently derived CD13 null strain [13] . Deletion of the floxed region of the CD13 locus in homozygous null animals was confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 1D) , and evaluation of CD13 mRNA and protein expression by RT-PCR (Fig. 1E ) and immunohistochemistry indicated a complete lack of expression in kidney and small intestine (Fig. 1F) , spleen, colon, and liver (not shown) tissue of the null animals as compared with abundant expression in the renal proximal tubules and brush border microvilli of WT controls. Interestingly, functional assessment of the deletion with a standard colorimetric CD13 substrate Ala-pNa (Fig. 1G , left; ref [14] ) showed a striking retention of peptidase activity in the serum of null animals, although only background levels of the CD13 protein were present in these samples when assessed by ELISA (Fig. 1G , right), suggesting that this commonly used method of assessing CD13 levels measures other peptidase activities as well, and results using this assay should be interpreted with caution.",

In normal and neoplastic hematopoietic populations, CD13 is expressed specifically on the earliest cell committed to the myeloid lineage (CFU-GM) and all of its differentiated progeny and is a reliable diagnostic marker for certain types of leukemia [3] . More recently, CD13 has been shown to be highly expressed on adult pluripotent stem cells derived from multiple sites [15] [16] [17] and differentiated ES cells [18, 19] , as well as subsets of peripheral blood progenitor cells [20] . In addition, CD13 has been postulated to play a role in fetal liver hematopoiesis [21] and myeloid cell differentiation [22] . Finally, CD13 expression has been reported to be controlled by various hematopoietic differentiation factors such as IL-4 and TGF-\u2424 [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, its specific contribution to normal hematopoiesis is unknown. Flow cytometric analysis of BM, spleen, and thymic cell populations showed an indistinguishable distribution of cells of the myeloid B and T cell populations in WT and CD13 null adult animals (Fig. 2) , with the exceptions of a significant (P\u03ed0.025) increase in numbers of the thymic CD4 populations in CD13 null mice, which is not seen in peripheral organs, and a modest but nonsignificant trend toward an increase in CD11b \u03e9 cells (but not CD11b \u03e9 / F4/80 \u03e9 cells) in the BM of CD13 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Furthermore, in vitro quantification of functional hematopoietic progenitor populations (hematopoietic stem cell, early lymphoid progenitors, and immature B cells) in spleen and BM indicated no difference in total colony-forming ability of precursors from the WT versus null animals (data not shown), suggesting that CD13 is not a critical regulator of developmental hematopoiesis or hemostasis.",

A similar examination of elicited peritoneal macrophages showed that CD13 is expressed predominantly on those populations expressing high levels of CD11b protein (Fig. 3C) . Further analysis of the CD11b high population with the F4.80 macrophage marker in WT and null animals shows identical cytometric profiles (Fig. 3D) , arguing against a developmental defect result-ing from the lack of CD13 in myeloid cells, and validating the use of this population in our in vitro assays.

The latter study found enhanced phagocytosis of antibody-modified target cells and prolonged downstream signaling upon engagement of the Fc\u2425R in the presence of cross-linking mAb to CD13 in primary monocytes or myeloid cell lines, suggesting that CD13 may be a functional regulator of this receptor. To address the contribution of CD13 to this process, we isolated BM macrophages (Fig. 4B , left) or resident (Fig. 4B, right) or elicited (not shown) primary peritoneal macrophages from WT and CD13 null mice and assayed their ability to phagocytose IgG-opsonized or control, nonopsonized sheep RBCs. Blocking phagocytosis by perturbation of microfilament assembly with cytochalasin D illustrates that basal uptake of nonopsonized RBCs does not occur by phagocytic mechanisms. No difference was observed in the microfilament-dependent phagocytic uptake of the opsonized target cells in any of the myeloid lineages tested; thus, CD13 is apparently dispensable for Fc\u2425R-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and DCs. However, a reproducible reduction in actin-independent basal uptake by the null cells was apparent, which was possibly relevant to studies implicating CD13 in lipid uptake and metabolism [33] [34] [35] and those proposing that CD13 is a target of the cholesterol uptake inhibitor Ezetimibe in enterocytes and macrophages [36, 37] . To address a potential role of CD13 in actin-independent endocytic processes, we assessed scavenger receptor-mediated uptake of oxLDL, which has been reported to be unaffected by cytochalasin D treatment [38] . Although untreated cells of either genotype showed no lipid uptake (not shown), the percentage of lipidcontaining CD13 null BMDMs (Fig. 4C , left) or peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4C, right) was comparable with that seen with WT cells, again, suggesting that CD13 is not required for Fc\u2425R-mediated phagocytosis or scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

To address the role of CD13 as an adhesion molecule, we purified CD31-positive primary lung microvascular endothelial cells from WT animals and assessed the ability of WT or CD13 null BMDMs to adhere to WT endothelial monolayers, untreated or treated with anti-CD13 antibodies or control IgG. Although overall adhesion of CD13 null cells was slightly lower than WT to untreated or control monolayers, treatment of the endothelial monolayer with cross-linking anti-mCD13 antibodies significantly increased the adhesion of WT but not CD13 null macrophages (Fig. 4D) , consistent with our results in human cells implicating CD13 as a myeloid adhesion molecule in a gain-of-function manner.",

In contrast to antibody treatment, we found no significant difference in cell numbers in the peritoneal exudates of the two genotypes at the three time-points tested (Fig. 6A) . A similar dichotomy between antibody treatment and null animals in peritonitis has been described previously for other cell surface molecules [48, 49] and is thought to be a result of an agonistic rather than blocking function of the antibody. Finally, as the C57Bl/6 strain has been shown to be able to compensate for the lack of other adhesion molecules that are critical for monocyte trafficking in other strains, we backcrossed the CD13 null animals onto the FVB background for 10 generations. These mice were fully capable of supporting cell infiltration into the peritoneum (Fig. 6B) , arguing against a strainspecific compensation in animals lacking CD13.",

Comparison of WT and CD13 null-treated ears showed equivalent levels of edema as measured by weight (Fig. 6C) , as well as the presence of comparable numbers of phenotypically identifiable neutrophils in both genotypes, whereas little to no extravasation was observed in vehicle-treated control ears (data not shown).

In the current study, we describe the production and analysis of a mouse strain harboring a floxed CD13 allele crossed with the ubiquitously expressed HPRT-cre transgenic to delete nearly 40% of the coding region of the gene, including regions specifying the enzymatic active site and the zinccoordinating region. These CD13 null mice are viable and fertile, suggesting few developmental or physiological defects, in agreement with studies describing an independently derived CD13 null strain [12] .

It is formally possible that CD13 could be functional at a reduced level in these animals, as the deleted allele retains the promoter, transcriptional start site, and initiation codon and thus, could produce a truncated transcript/protein containing the first three exons (splicing of the remaining exons results in a frameshift to a stop codon early in exon 14). However, we find that CD13 is undetectable at the mRNA level using primers spanning the nondeleted region (nt . This agrees with our in vitro data showing that expression of a construct containing a truncated cDNA with exons 1-3 does not produce a detectable, tagged protein (Fig. 1C) , probably as a result of instability of the truncated mRNA or incorrect folding of the truncated molecule. Similarly, immunohistochemical, flow cytometric, and ELISA assays confirm that the CD13 protein is not detectable in cells and tissue from these animals. The residual functional activity detected on the null cells illustrates that the widely used Ala-pNa assay does not detect CD13 activity specifically and should be used with caution.",

Mouse weights were recorded (top) and spleens weighed at termination (middle). The percent of ulcerated colonic tissue (bottom) was determined histologically and calculated as the percent of ulcerated tissue in the entire colon; n \u03ed 5 mice/genotype. (B) CD13 WT or null mice were immunized with Arthrogen-CIA mAb blend or PBS (Day 0). Assessment of disease severity was initiated on Day 4, as described in Materials and Methods. Each marker represents the mean \u03ee sem of clinical scores for five animals/genotype. ity and substrate cleavage, the argument for redundancy is more compelling, as numerous cell surface peptidases share overlapping substrate specificities. In this regard, although the preferred substrates of CD13 are N-terminal neutral amino acids, it can also cleave charged residues, albeit less efficiently. It is possible that another enzyme is substituting for CD13 to produce the necessary cleavage products. Another possibility is that many of the published studies implicating CD13 used monocytic cell lines and human peripheral blood monocytes, and in the current study, we used primary macrophages and DCs. It is formally possible that CD13 plays distinct roles in monocytes and more differentiated myeloid cells, which is not addressed in the current study. Finally, it has been shown that genes contributed by the C57Bl/6 background strain can compensate for a lack of critical adhesion molecules in inflammatory responses, particularly peritonitis [51] . This may be relevant to our studies, as the experiments described were performed on animals, where 96% of their background genes were contributed by the C57Bl/6 strain. In the previous study, the effects of inflammatory challenge in PECAM-1 (CD31) WT and null mice on the C57Bl/6 background were indistinguishable, and animals lacking PECAM-1 on the FVB background showed severe impairment of their inflammatory responses. However, in the current study, we found that CD13 is apparently not required for leukocyte infiltration in the peritonitis model in two independent inbred strains, arguing against a background influence.",

            "text": "These caveats aside, we find that the CD13 null animals have normal hematopoietic development and myeloid cell function, suggesting it is not required for physiologic homeostasis. Although this study is not exhaustive, we have focused on processes where CD13 has been implicated previously in studies using inhibitors or antibodies or where CD13 expression was shown to correlate with a particular function, as these would be particularly relevant to this loss-of-function analysis. For example, although treatment of animals with the CD13 inhibitor aprotinin showed a significant decrease in disease severity in the DSS model of inflammatory bowel disease [52] , weight loss, the percent of ulceration, and spleen weight in CD13 null animals are indistinguishable from that of WT animals. Similarly, numerous studies have implicated a role for CD13 in aspects of human T cell biology, where it has been reported to be expressed on peripheral T cell subsets and activated T cells [53] , where generally, treatment with CD13 inhibitors was described to diminish T cell proliferation via increases in TGF-\u2424 production [28 -30, 54] . This result seems at odds with our observation of a significant increase in the numbers of CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the null thymus but may be a result of the disparate origins (peripheral vs. thymic) of the T cells studied. Alternatively, it is possible that lack of CD13 alters the tight regulation of thymocyte selection, proliferation, or survival. Identification of the specific T cell subset(s) affected, determination if the increase were T cell-intrinsic or a result of stromal effects, and a possible impact on thymocyte trafficking will be necessary to determine the exact mechanisms responsible for the increase in thymic CD4 \u03e9 cells in CD13 null animals. Finally, although we have not focused specifically on T cell functions, the MLR measures the ability of primarily CD4 \u03e9 T cells to recognize and proliferate in response to a foreign histocompatibility antigen (MHC I or MHC II) presented by allogeneic APCs in the culture. As such, it is a means of assessing the capacity of the cells for self-recognition as well as the levels and context of MHC and costimulatory molecules, which are important for regulating the cell interactions involved in normal immune responses. We found no significant differences in the function of CD13 null cells when used as responder or stimulator cells, suggesting that CD13 is not critical for T cell proliferation and that the levels and context of molecules required for alloantigen presentation (stimulator) cells are unaffected in the null cells. Discrepancies with the published inhibitor studies may be the result of non-CD13specific, off-target effects of these peptidase antagonists or again, compensatory mechanisms.",

Actin-independent mechanisms have been illustrated for receptor-mediated and receptor-independent endocytosis and appear to be dependent on the particular antigen and the cell type [55, 56] . We [57] and others [36, 58 -60] have implicated CD13 previously in internalization of distinct surface proteins in various cell types. For example, in endothelial cells, we demonstrated that inhibition of CD13 impairs internalization of the bradykinin/bradykinin receptor complex by perturbing lipid raft organization, effectively inhibiting downstream signal transduction, filopodia formation, and cell invasion [57] . It is possible that the decrease in actin-independent uptake of erythrocytes but not modified lipid suggests that CD13 participates in specific mechanisms of macrophage uptake, a possibility that we are pursuing currently.",

One functional investigation into Fc\u2425R-mediated phagocytosis in monocytes demonstrated that CD13 is present in phagocytic vesicles, and concomitant cross-linking of surface Fc\u2425Rs and CD13 molecules enhanced phagocytosis and prolonged signaling via the FcR [32] , suggesting that CD13 may function as a signal regulator. However, we see no difference in Fc\u2425R-mediated uptake of similarly opsonized targets in the presence or absence of CD13. This may indicate that similar to other ligand-binding signaling receptors, CD13 must be cross-linked first to induce downstream signal transduction cascades. Alternatively, the comparable phagocytic capacity of cells with or without CD13 could point to the fact that although CD13 cross-linking may trigger processes that complement those elicited by the Fc\u2425R, it does not normally do so. Finally, it is possible that CD13 may be important in the phagocytosis of certain types of opsonized antigens that are also CD13 cross-linking ligands, which would engage the FcR and CD13 and thus, be internalized more efficiently. The identification of such ligands is a current focus of our laboratory.",

This finding may be relevant to the defective angiogenesis reported in an independently derived, global CD13 KO strain [6] . It is clear that in many pathologic settings (such as wound-healing, tumors, ischemic injury), the cytokines produced by infiltrating, inflammatory cells promote robust angiogenesis [61] [62] [63] . Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium at the site of injury is a prerequisite for inflammatory cell infiltration, and thus, a CD13-dependent defect in adhesion would logically decrease the number of infiltrating cells, reduce proangiogenic cytokine levels, and impair angiogenesis. Although the published study did not address monocytic infiltration specifically, it may well contribute to the observed phenotype.",

Logically, specific inflammatory challenges may elicit unique molecules that bind to and cross-link CD13 and thus, are CD13-dependent, whereas other immune challenges are not. Treatment with the anti-CD13 antibody may mimic such a ligand and as such, would produce a phenotype distinct from that of a loss-of-function model. Indeed, we have shown that cross-linking of CD13 with mAb or with its multivalent ligand, the human coronavirus H229e [64, 65] , leads to a signal transduction-dependent, gain-of-function increase in monocyte adhesion to endothelium [39] . It is possible that the virus has co-opted the normal host response to cross-linking ligands to gain access to tissues and so, may phenocopy such a ligand [39] . Thus, the role of CD13 in myeloid cells awaits the identification of these ligands, which will undoubtedly be facilitated by the availability of CD13 null animals. ",
