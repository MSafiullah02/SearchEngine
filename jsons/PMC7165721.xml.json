            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects chickens of all ages causing respiratory, urogenital, reproductive and/or digestive systems diseases. Infectious bronchitis virus belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae) (Carstens 2010; Dong et al. 2007) and its genome consists of an approximately 30\u2010kb\u2010long single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA. The genome structure and the biology of the virus predispose for changes in IBV genome (Ovchinnikova et al. 2011; Woo et al. 2009). The most important are changes in the spike protein gene (S), especially in its S1 part which encodes extracellular protein subdomain since they may imply a change in the antigenicity or pathogenicity of the virus. So far, many genotypes, serotypes or protectotypes have been identified, depending on the method used for differentiation. However, even the most commonly used genotyping results were sometimes ambiguous because there were no standard rules that should be followed. That's why new classification based on S1 coding region sequence which distinguished and named 32 lineages arranged in six genotypes has been recently proposed (Valastro et al. 2016).",

Interestingly, the S1 coding region of this variant was different from other European IBV strains which resulted in its classification to the GII genotype together with Dutch V1397 strain (Valastro et al. 2016). For many years the D1466 strains has been only occasionally recognized but results of a molecular survey conducted between 2005 and 2006 indicated increasing problems connected with this variant in most countries of Western Europe (Worthington et al. 2008). In Poland this variant emerged in 2011 and subsequently has been identified in different parts of the country (Domanska\u2010Blicharz et al. 2012).",

The next step is identification of detected IBV strain, which relays on amplification, sequencing and blast (Basic Local Alignment Research Tool) or phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of S1 coding region. Recently proposed IBV classification is based on the sequence of the entire S1 part with a length of 1620 nt but this is only possible for highly specialized molecular laboratories (Valastro et al. 2016). The main obstacle is the lack of universal primers and sometimes many primers should be tested before final strain identification which could be a very time and labour consuming. On the other hand, information about IBV circulating in the field should be quickly obtained as it is important for selecting suitable protective vaccine. The real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assays seem to be effective tools for IBV\u2010type identification and although S1 coding region is prone to mutations, methods aimed in this gene detection has been recently developed and used for GI\u20101 (Mass, Connecticut), GI\u20109 (Arkansas), GI\u201011 (SAI), G1\u201016 (ASAII) and GIV\u20101 (DE072/GA98) lineages (Acevedo et al. 2013; Marandino et al. 2016; Roh et al. 2014, 2013).",

Moreover, these multiple steps of RNA/DNA handling might result in cross\u2010contamination and as consequences in false positive results. The real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay helps to avoid these disadvantages. Here, we describe the development of a TaqMan probe\u2010based real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR for the detection of GII\u20101 (D1466\u2010like) IBV lineage.

So far, standard nested RT\u2010PCR assay was commonly used for this purpose (Cavanagh et al. 1999; Worthington et al. 2008). Both methods target similar fragment of S1 coding fragment which is crucial for IBV\u2010type determination. However, the primers and probe designed for real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR met single mismatches in nucleotide sequences of D1466\u2010like IBV strains previously detected in Poland and they include some degenerative ones (two in the reverse primer and two in the probe) to avoid failure in this genotype detection. The standard curve and linear regression analysis were performed using serial dilutions of known quantity of GII\u20101 IBV RNA (Fig. 1). C\nt values ranged from 17\u00b770 to 37\u00b703 cycles (Table 1) with a coefficient of determination (R\n2) of 0\u00b7996. The slope of \u22123\u00b7168 reveals a very high RT\u2010PCR efficiency (106%). The limit of detection of the GII\u20101 IBV real\u2010time RT\u2010PCRs and universal for all gammacoronavirus were similar at the level of an approximately 56 copies of viral RNA. The sensitivity of the standard nested RT\u2010PCR was almost 30\u2010fold lower and detected the presence about 1500 copies of viral RNA (Table 1). Moreover, the assay developed in the present study showed to be highly specific as no fluorescent signals were detected with other tested IBV lineages or chicken RNA viral pathogens. The intra and interassay precision of the new method were assessed using serial dilutions of D1466 IBV RNA ranging from 8\u00b72 \u00d7 106 down to 5\u00b76 \u00d7 101 copies. The repeatability CVs of D1466 real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR ranged from 0\u00b717 to 0\u00b769%, while the reproducibility CVs ranged from 0\u00b799 to 3\u00b755% (Table 2).",

The total of 190 field samples from chicken (broilers, commercial layers and broiler breeders) were tested by gammacoronavirus universal real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay in the period between 2014 and 2016. One hundred and twenty\u2010seven (66\u00b78%) were positive for IBV. When these samples were tested by the GII\u20101 real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR, 4 of 127 (3\u00b715%) were positive. Interestingly, no D1466\u2010positive sample was detected in 2014 but three samples in 2015 and one in 2016 were identified. Molecular studies carried out between 2005 and 2006 in Western European countries showed growing problems associated with D1466 genotype (Worthington et al. 2008). In 2005, the average frequency of the D1466\u2010like virus in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany was about 3\u20135%, and in 2006 the presence of this variant increased to 7, 10 and 16% respectively. In Poland, in the period from November 2011, when the first case of D1466 IBV was detected, to December 2013, the standard nested RT\u2010PCR was used and this assay enabled detection of 26 positive samples indicating the presence of this variant at 11\u00b77% of studied chicken flocks.

            "text": "The assay here developed enables the estimation of the amount of viral RNA copies, which could be a useful indicator of the infection phase and correlate with viraemia or clinical disease (Mackay et al. 2002). The real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR is able to detect as few as 56 RNA molecules of this IBV lineage. When testing field samples, the C\nt values obtained were relatively high (mean C\nt values of 32\u00b74 \u00b1 3\u00b78) which address the mean amount of virus RNA about 1500 copies per reaction. The low number of GII\u20101 IBV RNA copies in most cases did not parallel the C\nt values obtained in universal real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR which were much lower. This was due to the presence of other IBV lineages in these samples. Subsequent applied assays aimed at the identification of other IBV lineages revealed the presence GI\u20101 (Mass\u2010like), GI\u201013 (793B\u2010like), GI\u201019 (QX\u2010like) or GI\u201023 (Var2\u2010like) in almost all of them. There was only one case where the C\nt values in both assays were equal indicating a low number of RNA copies (C\nt about 32). It seems that this variant replicates poorly in the tissues of chickens and its excretion with the faeces is also low. The poorly replicating viruses are unlikely to cause disease symptoms. In fact some of the D1466\u2010positive chicken flocks were described as healthy by the maintenance staff. Therefore, pathogenicity and virulence of the GII\u20101 strains seem to be insignificant.",
