            "text": "In December 2019\uff0ca novel coronavirus, currently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly called 2019-nCoV, was first identified in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 caused a respiratory disease called Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which was officially named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020. COVID-19 had caused severe illness and death in China and had spread to countries around the world [1] [2] [3] [4] . By March 30, 2020, a total of 82447 confirmed cases have been reported in China [5] . Moreover, 552479 cases have been confirmed in other countries, mainly in America, Italy and Spain [5] . The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, and sore throat [6] . Asymptomatic infected individuals, called \"asymptomatic carrier or transmitter\", may also become the contagious source of SARS-CoV-2, and some of them progress rapidly, even resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high case-fatality rate [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is the golden standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, is only about 30-50%. The high false-negative result rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing inevitably increases the difficulty in managing the current 5 / 21 COVID-19 outbreak as the misdiagnosed patients might miss the best timing for proper treatment and cause the spread of disease [11] . The chest computed tomography (CT), especially high-resolution CT (HRCT) is also the main diagnostic method followed by \"Pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 infection (trial version 5)\" issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China ( http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). CT findings plays an important role in detecting lung abnormalities, facilitate the early identification of the diseases.",

The CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia had its pathophysiological basis [18] . Since the diameter of SARS-CoV-2 is about 60-140nm, and the size of the alveolar pores is about 10-15\u03bcm, after inhaled through the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 invades the bronchioles, mainly involving the interstitium around bronchioles at the end of lobular bronchioles, causing bronchiolitis and peribronchitis, and spreads to the distal end. Therefore, the lesion originates from a round-like nodule in the core of the secondary lung lobule, which were usually shown as round ground-glass opacity at first, and then extends to the whole secondary pulmonary lobules, forming lobular patchy imaging. SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades the interlobular interstitium, resulting in the appearance of fine reticulation sign. Halo sign is the image that the lesion infiltrates from central nodule of lobule core to surrounding interstitium and accumulation of inflammatory cells in interstitium. The virus spreads along both sides of reticular structure of the interlobular septa, leading to the sign that the long axis of the lesion is parallel to the pleura. Inflammatory stimulation leads to thickening of blood vessels in the lesion, which results in a corresponding alteration on imaging.",

The average age of patients was 42.60\u00b116.56 years old. Based on the CT findings of first reexamination after admission, 58 patients were divided into four groups: 1. Absorption group (22 cases, 37.9%), 2. Improvement group (23 cases, 39.7%),3. No change group (3 cases, 5.2%), 4. Progression group (10 cases, 17.2%) (seefigure 2). Among these asymptomatic patients, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms after admission, including fever (8 cases, 50%), cough (9 cases, 56.3%), fatigue (8 cases, 50%), shortness of breath (2 cases, 12.5%) and diarrhea (1 case, 6.3%). In these 16 patients, 10 patients (62.5%) were in lesion progression group, 3 patients (18.75%) were in lesion improvement group and 3 patients (18.75%) were in no change group. The average days before symptoms onset is 3.71\u00b12.86 days, patients in lesion progression group have shorter days before symptoms onset (3.25\u00b12.77 day). CT findings at admission showed abnormalities in all patients (seen inFigure 1). Less than half of the patients (24, 41.4%) presented bilateral lesions; 34 (58.6%) patients showed unilateral lung distribution, including 14 (24.1%) in left lung and 20 (34.5%) in right lung. The lesions mostly located in peripheral (44, 75.9%), and 14 (24.1%) patients presented central distribution. The involvement of lower lobes (right 68.9% vs left 62.1%) was a bit more than that of the upper lobes (right 51.7% vs left 53.4%). 24 (41.4%) patients had single lobe involved, 14 (24.1%) patients had involved of two lobes, and 20 (34.5%) patients had three or more lobes involved. The most common pattern of CT findings was GGO (55,94.8%), including simple GGO in 30 cases (51.7%), GGO with fine reticulation in 7 cases (12.1%), GGO with subpleural curviliner line in 6 cases (10.3%), GGO with air bronchogram in 5 cases (8.6%), GGO with halo sign in 5 cases (8.6%) and GGO with vascular enlargement in 2 cases (3.5%).",
