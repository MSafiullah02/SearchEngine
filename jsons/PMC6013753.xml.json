            "text": "Disease taxonomy plays an important role in defining the diagnosis, treatment, and mechanisms of human diseases. The principle of the current clinical disease taxonomies, in particular the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), goes back to the work of William Farr in the nineteenth century and is primarily derived from the differentiation of clinical features (e.g. symptoms and micro-examination of diseased tissues and cells) (Council et al., 2011). Despite its extensive clinical use, this classification system lacks the depth required for precision medicine with the limitations of its rigid hierarchical structure and, moreover, it does not exploit the rapidly expanding molecular insights of disease phenotypes. For example, many diseases (e.g. cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases) in the current disease taxonomies have either high genetic heterogeneity (Bianchini et al., 2016; McClellan and King, 2010) or manifestation diversity (Arostegui et al., 2014; Jeste and Geschwind, 2014; Mannino, 2002), which give little basis for tailoring treatment to a patient's pathophysiology. Furthermore, disease comorbidities (Hu et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2008; Hidalgo et al., 2009), temporal disease trajectories (Jensen et al., 2014) in clinical populations, various molecular relationships between disease-associated cellular components and their connections in the interactome (Blair et al., 2013; Goh et al., 2007; Barabasi et al., 2011; Rzhetsky et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2014), and many successful drug repurposing cases (Li and Jones, 2012; Chong and Sullivan Jr., 2007; Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Wu et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2005) altogether demonstrate the vague boundary between different diseases in current disease taxonomies. Moreover, the deep understanding of diseases based on the advances in disease biology, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data necessitates the reclassification of disease taxonomy (Mirnezami et al., 2012).",

Further insights will arise from integrating all types of biomedical data with a single framework to exploit disease-disease relationships. Data integration methods that utilize multiple types of data, including ontological and omics data, have been used to classify and refine disease relationships (Gligorijevic and Przulj, 2015; Menche et al., 2015; Gligorijevic et al., 2016). Despite these efforts, the development of a molecular-based disease taxonomy that links molecular networks and pathophenotypes still remains challenging (Menche et al., 2015; Hofmann-Apitius et al., 2015; Jameson and Longo, 2015).",

For example, if two disease pairs have close positions (e.g. have a low level common parent disease) in the disease taxonomy, then we would expect that those disease pairs might have common genes or shared protein-protein interactions or similar phenotypes. We calculated the category similarity between disease pairs using a widely used semantic similarity measure (i.e. Lin measure using information content) (Lin, 1998; Pesquita et al., 2009) to represent the closeness of disease pairs located in the ICD taxonomy. Information theoretic measures such as information content have been used in the context of ICD-9-CM previously (Dahlem et al., 2015). The category similarity measure takes as input two concepts c1 and c2 and outputs a numeric measure of similarity. If two ICD codes have a very specific common parent code in the taxonomic tree structure, then the category similarity would be ~ 1.",

Betweenness (Freeman, 1977) is a widely used centrality measure to quantify how many shortest paths run through a given node. In particular, bridging nodes that connect disparate components of the network often have a high betweenness. The betweenness centrality of a node v is given by:(3)bcv=\u2211s\u2260v\u2260tnstvgstwhere nst(v) denotes the number of shortest paths from s to t that pass through v and gst is the total number of shortest paths from s to t. We will adopt the convention that nstvgst=0 if both nst(v) and gst are zero. We assume the molecular diversity of diseases would largely lie on the related genes with maximum betweenness. For example, to quantify the molecular diversity (in terms of maximum betweenness) of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we calculated all the betweenness values for the AD-related genes, such as APP, APOE, TNF and NOS3. Finally, we considered the molecular diversity of AD as 8.44e-3 since we found that APP has the maximum betweenness of 8.44e-3 among those genes (see Fig. S5a). In fact, this kind of measurement has been successfully used in a previous study (Zhou et al., 2014) to evaluate the diversity of diseases, which indicated that the diversity of disease manifestations has a strong positive correlation with the molecular diversity of diseases. For disease taxonomy with good quality, we would expect it to have its lowest level diseases (the leaf nodes in the tree-structure disease taxonomy) with similar molecular diversities.",

In this algorithm, we integrated the correlation between category similarity and module similarity with significant disease-chapter associations (which are based on the shared gene similarity) to predict the additional chapters for a given disease. We divide the disease pairs in the same chapter to three subsets, which correspond to those pairs with shared root parents, shared second-level intermediate parents and shared third-level intermediate parents, respectively, to help predict to what degree a pair of diseases would be located closely in the disease taxonomy. The principle of the algorithm adheres to the positive correlation between category similarity (or the closeness of position of the disease pairs in ICD disease taxonomy) and molecular profile similarity of disease pairs, which means that strong molecular profile similarity between disease pairs would indicate close locations of them in the disease taxonomy.

Therefore, MSDN and SGDN are actually two complementary molecular association evidences for disease pairs and we finally obtained the union of the subset of MSDN and SGDN as the molecular association disease network (MADN), which contains 35,389 links and 1811 nodes with the weights derived from the two original networks.

The modularity of these 17 top-level categories (this makes a good comparable partition with ICD chapters) in the network of 223 sub-categories is 0.426, which means a rather good partition of the network. These 17 NCs contain different numbers of sub-categories ranging from 4 to 25 or of diseases ranging from 53 to 369 (Fig. S11c & Data S10), covering diseases from all of the 17 chapters of ICD taxonomy (Table S11).

If the diseases in such NCD sub-categories would tend to involve shared genes, then the diseases would be more likely associated with one another than other diseases. To test this hypothesis, we obtained the overlapping disease codes (ODC) in both NCD and the two external phenotype-genotype association databases and evaluate the degree of these ODC disease links in each NCD sub-category when considering two diseases linked if they share common genes. In detail, we firstly obtained the common disease codes involved in both NCD and UCSC-GWAS or PheWAS database.

After that for each NCD sub-category, we generated a complete disease network with the ODC diseases in it and overlaid the network on the disease network with shared genes.

We then created a disease network comprising 1883 nodes (representing ICD codes) and 154,563 edges. The edge weight reflects the category similarity values and higher values reflect higher similarity between diseases whose code positions are adjacent in the ICD tree. The category similarity distribution showed that most disease pairs (135,271, 87.52%) had similarities between 0.2 and 0.5 (Fig. S4a). Disease pairs within this range mostly belong to different disease subcategories in the same chapter, such as diseases of other endocrine glands and disorders of thyroid gland. For example, type 2 diabetes (ICD: 250.00) and simple goiter (ICD: 240.0), which are in ICD chapter 3, have a category similarity of 0.37.

We found that the number of predicted categories positively correlated with the molecular diversity of the original disease codes (Fig. 3c, PCC = 0.547, 95% CI = [0.514, 0.578], p < 4.94e-324; for External validations see SM 5.2). This indicates that diseases with multiple pathogenic pathways could be captured by polyhierarchical mapping. For example, the 20 diseases in Chapter 8 (i.e. Diseases of the Respiratory System) have been predicted to belong to over five additional chapters, such as neoplasms, infectious diseases, and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 3d), which is consistent with the heterogeneous pathogenesis of COPD and asthma (Grainge et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2015). A detailed discussion on the polyhierarchial map of the mental disorders is offered in SM Section 5.3 (Fig. S8).",

From the molecular network perspective, we first investigated the utility, shortcomings, and inconsistencies of ICD-9-CM, the established disease taxonomy for clinical settings. We found that there exist a considerable number (~40% of our investigated diseases) of diseases, for example, cancer and infectious diseases, that have diverse molecular network mechanisms and tend to interact more with diseases from other chapters. It is also these molecularly diverse diseases that mainly contribute to the blurred boundary of ICD disease taxonomy (see Methods, SM Section 4&7). Upon exploring the molecular diversity and cross-chapter interactions between diseases, we propose a novel disease classification system based on the integration of the clinical and molecular profiles of diseases. In particular, we integrate disease networks taking into account molecular and phenotypic connectivity among diseases, predict the multiple disease categories that diseases belong to, and finally validate the biological cohesiveness of our NCD by network topological measures such as modularity and shortest path length.",

In our NCD, a disease with a high molecular diversity tends to be classified into multiple disease categories, which indicates that there exist more disease subtypes for that disease. For example, \u201cmalignant neoplasm of the pancreas\u201d was reclassified into 11 sub-categories and 4 NCs, which is consistent with a recent study wherein 4 phenotypic subtypes of pancreatic cancer were enriched for 10 distinct molecular mechanisms (Bailey et al., 2016).

On the one hand, our approach accurately links diseases with all possible underlying mechanisms in the molecular interaction network. On the other hand, it presents a promising approach to the identification of targeted drugs for the treatment of related diseases. For example, breast cancer and influenza (both in NC11.M02) may share potential drug targets (Park, 2012). As another example, metformin, widely prescribed to treat metabolic syndrome (in NC11.M02), could alter the gut microbiome composition and function, improve gut microbial dysbiosis (Forslund et al., 2015; Cabreiro et al., 2013), and also prevent colorectal cancer (also in NC11.M02) through microbiome-influenced immune response modification (Nakatsu et al., 2015). Here, it is important to note that while a considerable number of diseases have a strong environmental component, our main focus has been the many diverse molecular determinants. In the future, additional environmental factors such as epigenetic changes can be added into the data integration scheme to further refine the classification.",

Although we have aimed to address the possible confounders by constructing random controls and using external evaluations, the incompleteness and bias incorporated in the integrated data sources are likely to influence the generalization of our results. For example, DiseaseConnect yields an incomplete disease-gene database: 1883 ICD diseases could be mapped (Table S11), leading to only 1797 diseases included in the NCD. Furthermore, as with other studies that rely on literature-based and ontological knowledge, investigation bias remains an issue, where the molecular mechanisms (e.g. related genes and their interactions) of some diseases (e.g. cancer) being more intensively studied than others may influence the results (Menche et al., 2015). We expect the results of similar works to be more refined in the future as biomedical datasets become more complete. The incorporation of more comprehensive disease-gene data sources, such as DISEASES (Pletscher-Frankild et al., 2015) and MalaCards (Rappaport et al., 2017), could result in an improved study. While we have chosen to keep individual external gene expression datasets outside the scope of this study since gene expression is highly tissue- and cell-type dependent, it presents an interesting future direction and could potentially improve the quality of the resulting disease categories if exhaustive lists of tissue-specific expression datasets are used in dedicated studies. In addition, our NCD merely delivers a two-level taxonomy framework without elaborated hierarchical structures in the same disease categories, which could be further refined or optimized through methods like hierarchical clustering algorithms (Murtagh and Contreras, 2012) and systematic posteriori ontology engineering method (Gessler et al., 2013). Finally, high-quality ontologies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (Kohler et al., 2014) and Disease Ontology (Kibbe et al., 2015), can be used for external validation, or for further integration to obtain more robust and extensive NCDs.",
