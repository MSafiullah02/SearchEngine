Although it may be counter-intuitive that a newly identified virus that can infect anyone would rapidly manifest pronounced racial disparities, a consistent pattern has been reported across multiple states, showing that black Americans comprise a disproportionately greater number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other Americans2, 3, 4 For instance, in New York City, the current epicenter of the US epidemic, COVID-19 deaths disproportionately affect black Americans (22% of population and 28% of deaths) and in the rest of the state (9% of the population and 18% of deaths).5 Such disparities are also evident within individual counties, such as in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin where black residents comprise 26% of the population yet account for 73% of COVID-19 deaths;6 and in Dougherty County, GA (69% black) where 81% of 38 deaths were black.7\n",

In the meantime, it is possible to use ecological analyses with data at the county level to assess determinants of risk among black Americans to inform immediate policy actions. However, this approach risks confounding of the relationship between proportion of black Americans and disease and death rates in a county and other social determinants of health potentially associated with risk for COVID-19 infection and death, such as sociodemographic, comorbidities, and socioeconomic determinants.",

We plotted the county proportion of black residents by the county rate of COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusted for days since first infection in the county. To assess whether observed associations between proportion of black residents and COVID-19 cases and deaths were confounded by other factors, we used Bayesian hierarchical models. A zero-inflated negative binomial model with a logarithmic link function was fit separately to COVID-19 cases and deaths using integrated nested Laplace approximations.23 The model included county population as an offset term, adjusted for all county-level characteristics (see Table 1\nfor characteristics), and included a spatially structured state-level random effect.24 We also included a variable representing days since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in each county in order to control for potential confounding by temporality of the outbreak. Diffuse priors were included for all components of the model. Exponentiated regression coefficients are presented along with 95% confidence intervals, representing rate ratios of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The primary question was whether the rate ratios COVID-19 cases and deaths for disproportionately black counties remained significant after controlling for sociodemographics, comorbidities, and socioeconomic determinants. In reporting results for the covariates, county-level characteristics are scaled to represent a comparison of two counties similar in all other respects, but for one county having the variable of interest equal to the observed third quartile of that characteristic, the other equal to the observed first quartile. Thus, rate ratios greater than one mean that higher levels of a given characteristic are associated with higher rates of COVID-19 cases or deaths. For \u201cmodifiable\u201d risk factors (e.g., insurance, population density), we computed population attributable fractions by computing the multiplicative reduction in predicted number of cases/deaths under the observed data versus when all counties in the upper three quartiles of a risk factor were reduced to the first quartile.

Counties with more households having >1 person per room experienced greater rates COVID-19 cases, but counties reporting less social distancing had paradoxically fewer COVID-19 cases. These results may be due to the lack of granularity in the social distancing data when comparing counties rather than individuals, and potentially limited validation and imprecision of metrics used to gauge social distancing. Another explanation may be that metrics used to gauge social distancing could be biased because of differential access to personal mobile cellphones. A smaller percentage of households in nonurban metro and rural areas have mobile broadband access, 58.5% and 55.4%, respectively, compared to 68.2% for all households41; different patterns of phone sharing could result in estimates of social distancing biased towards less social interaction.",

Given the aforementioned challenges in individual reporting of race in existing surveillance systems, the county-level data presented here represent an ecological analysis that could be subject to structural confounding where there are more black people in urban centers and urban centers have been more likely to be affected to date in the first wave of COVID-19. This possibility can be addressed by the responses to several questions. Are disproportionately black counties the urban counties affected early by COVID-19? The theory of structural confounding suggests that no individuals or low numbers of individuals in extreme cells (in this case, the most rural areas) raise concerns about the possibility of structural confounding.45\n,\n46 Our data reveal a trend to higher proportions of black population in the most urban counties. However, all five strata for lower urbanization still have 35%-50% of the percent black residents observed in the most urban counties. Within disproportionately black counties, is the impact of COVID-19 homogenous, or do relatively more black and less black areas within a given county have differential impact? Even within heavily impacted urban areas, predominantly black neighborhoods have higher rates of COVID-19 disease and death. For example, in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, white suburbs are relatively unimpacted, while predominantly black suburbs are heavily impacted.47 Third, do excess COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths occur among black people in more rural counties, or in counties that experienced outbreaks later in the epidemic? The risk of COVID-19 diagnoses for counties with more black residents is consistent across levels of urbanicity. The risk of COVID-19-related death for disproportionately black counties is significantly higher only in small metro and rural areas. Further, where rural transmission has been significant, it has been in disproportionately black counties.48\n,\n49 Counties like Dougherty County Georgia experienced intense outbreaks among black Georgians a month later than the early wave of infections in large urban areas. In sum, the alignment of individual-level and neighborhood data within urban centers and the county-level data presented here documenting disproportionate burden among black people suggests that the ecologic analyses presented here are not attributable to structural confounding, and may hold true at the individual level in at least some cases.49, 50, 51, 52, 53\n",

            "text": "Although we have presented attributable fractions for associations of COVID-19 that are consistent with our conceptual framework54 of heterogeneity in the burden of disease and for secondary mortality, there is limited inference of causality in these relationships. Causal inference estimations are critical and represent a future direction for the analyses presented here. Importantly, COVID-19 transmission dynamics are complex and evolving and the inferences may evolve with additional data. We posit that these analyses of disproportionate burden among black people are likely conservative because black Americans are less likely to have health insurance and evidence is emerging across the country that black people with symptoms for COVID-19 are less likely than other groups to be tested for the virus. Ultimately, these analyses draw strength from highlighting specific counties at elevated risk for COVID-19 and identifying more locations with disparate COVID-19 outcomes among black Americans than those profiled in the media including Dougherty County, GA; St John the Baptist Parish, LA; Cook County, IL; Milwaukee County, WI; Queens County, NY.",

Additional analyses exploring disparities in COVID-19 among Latino, Native American and other populations is critical as the results of inequitable outcomes are representative of past respiratory pathogens including H1N147 in the U.S. and thus likely indicative of potentially future waves of COVID-19 and other rapidly emerging respiratory pathogens. Health disparities arise from a complex interplay of underlying social, environmental, economic, and structural inequities. We will continue to fail to address longstanding inequities until we commit to eliminating structural racism and the systemic roots that maintain and even reinforce these injustices.55 Ultimately, advancing the health and wellbeing of all Americans relies on leveraging these and other data to effect policy change that makes equity a reality in the U.S.",
