This is because our world is finite, and the randomness, indispensable for neutral evolution, is important when we consider the history of a finite world. The random nature of DNA propagation is discussed using branching process, coalescent process, Markov process, and diffusion process. Expected evolutionary patterns under neutrality are then discussed on fixation probability, rate of evolution, and amount of DNA variation kept in population. We then discuss various features of neutral evolution starting from evolutionary rates, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, junk DNA, and pseudogenes.",

Systematic pressure, particularly natural selection, was believed to play the major role in evolution. This view is applicable if the population size, or the number of individuals in one population, is effectively infinite. However, the earth is finite, and the number of individuals is always finite. Even this whole universe is finite. This finiteness is the basis of the random nature of neutral evolution as we will see in later sections of this chapter.",

A cell is the basic building block for all organisms except for viruses. It is thus natural to consider cell as a unit of evolution. One cell is equivalent to one individual in single-cell organisms. In multicellular organisms, by definition, one individual is composed of many cells, and a single cell is no longer a unit of evolution. However, if we consider only germ-line cells and ignore somatic cells, we can still discuss cell lineages as the mainstream of multicellular organisms as in the case of single-cell organisms. Alternatively, clonal cells of one single-cell organism can be considered to be one individual. Cellular slime mold cells form a single body with many cells, or each cell may stay independently, depending on the environmental conditions [7]. We therefore should be careful to define cell or individual.",

In classic population genetics theory, this reproduction unit is called \u201c Mendelian population,\u201d after Gregor Johann Mendel, father of genetics. From an individual point of view, the largest Mendelian population is the species this individual belongs to. Asexually reproducing organisms are not necessary to form a population, and multiple individuals observed in proximity, which are often recognized as one population, may be just an outcome of past life history of the organism, and each individual may reproduce clonally. Therefore, there are many clonal lineages in one \u201cpopulation,\u201d and each clonal lineage may also be called \u201cpopulation.\u201d Gene exchanges also occur in asexually reproducing organisms, including bacteria. Therefore, by extending species concept, bacterial cells with similar phylogenetic relationship are called species. Population or species is also defined for viruses, where each virus particle is assumed as one \u201cindividual.\u201d",

Supply of mutations to the continuous flow of self-replication of genetic materials (DNA or RNA) is fundamental for organismal evolution. This process is most faithfully described in phylogenetic relationship of genes. Because every organism is the product of eons of evolution, we are unable to grasp full characteristics of living beings without understanding the evolutionary history of genes and organisms. It is thus clear that the reconstruction of phylogeny of genes is essential not only for the study of evolution but also for biology in general. In another word, gene genealogy is the basic descriptor of evolution.",

Therefore, even if many nucleotide sequences happened to be identical, there must be genealogical relationship for those sequences. However, it is impossible to reconstruct the genealogical relationship without mutational events. In this respect, search of mutational events from genes and their products is also important for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.

There are two types of genes that have small difference in their nucleotide sequences, depicted by open and filled circles. Both types are located in the same location in one particular chromosome of this organism. This location is called \u201c locus\u201d (plural form is \u201cloci\u201d), after a Latin word meaning place, and one type of nucleotide sequence is called \u201c allele,\u201d using a Greek word \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf meaning \u201cdifferent.\u201d Open circle allele, called allele A, is ancestral type, and filled circle allele, called allele M, emerged by a mutation shown as a star mark. The numbers of gene copies are 8 and 2 for alleles A and M, respectively. We thus define allele frequencies of these two alleles as 0.8 (=8/10) and 0.2 (=2/10), respectively. Allele frequency is sometimes called gene frequency. It should be noted that these frequencies are exact values if there are only ten genes in the population in question. If these ten genes were sampled from that population with many more genes, two values are sample allele frequency.\n",

Alternatively, only descendants of that common ancestral gene are considered in the gene genealogy of Fig. 5.2. There are, however, many genes which did not contribute to the ten genes at the present time. If we consider these once existed genes, the population history may look like Fig. 5.3. In this figure, the gene genealogy starting from the filled circle gene at generation 1 is embedded with other genes which coexisted at each generation but became extinct in later generations. If we consider the whole population, it is clear that allele frequency changes continuously, and many genes shown in open circles did not contribute to the current generation. How can this allele frequency change occur? Natural selection does influence this change (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-92642-1_6), but the more fundamental process is the random genetic drift. This occurs because a finite number of genes are more or less randomly sampled from the parental generation to produce the offspring generation. This simple stochastic process is the source of random fluctuation of allele frequencies through generations.\n",

            "text": "The random genetic drift can be described as follows. Let us focus on one particular diploid population with N[t] individuals at generation t. We consider certain autosomal locus A, and the total number of genes on that locus at generation t is 2N[t]. There are many alleles in locus A, but let us consider one particular allele Ai with ni gene copies. By definition, allele frequency pi for allele Ai is ni/2N[t]. When one sperm or egg is formed via meiosis, one gene copy is included in that gamete from locus A. If males and females are assumed to have more or less the same allele frequency, the probability to have allele Ai in that gamete is pi. This procedure is a Bernoulli trial, and the offspring generation at time t + 1 will be formed with 2N[t + 1] Bernoulli trials. Because all these trials are expected to be independent, we have the following binomial distribution to give the probability Prob[k] of having k copies among 2N[t + 1] genes in the offspring generation:5.1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{Prob}}\\left[ k \\right] =_{2N[t + 1]} {\\text{C}}_{k} p^{k} \\left( {1{-}p} \\right)^{{2N\\left[ {t + 1} \\right]{-}k}} $$\\end{document}where xCy (=x!/[(x \u2212 y)!y!]) is the possible combination to choose y out of x, and subscript i of pi was dropped for simplicity. Continuation of this binomial distribution for many generations results in the random genetic drift of allele frequencies. When the number of individuals in that population, or population size, is quite large, this fluctuation is small because of \u201claw of large numbers\u201d in probability theory, yet the effect of random genetic drift will never disappear under finite population size. The random genetic drift was extensively studied by Sewall Wright and was sometimes called \u201c Wrightian effect\u201d in old literatures. Figure 5.4 shows examples of computer simulations of the random genetic drift under a set of very simple conditions: discrete generations, haploid, constant population size, no population structure, and no recombination. Population size (the total number of individuals or genes in one population) is 1000 in Fig. 5.4a and 10,000 in Fig. 5.4b. The initial allele frequency was set to be 0.2, and the temporal changes of up to 1000 generations are shown. In each case, five replications are shown. Clearly, as population size increases, fluctuation of allele frequencies decreases. This simplified situation is often called the Wright\u2013 Fisher model, honoring Sewall Wright and Ronald A. Fisher [9].\n",

Watson, who used generating function, and they published a joint paper in 1875 [10].

In diploid organism, the number of gene copies for an autosomal locus is 2N, while the number of gene copies for haploid organism locus is N. The former situation is assumed explicitly or implicitly in many literatures. However, the original lifestyle of organisms is haploid, and many organisms today are haploids. Therefore, we consider the situation in haploid organisms first. It should be noted that an approximate constant population size is more or less expected if we consider a long-term evolution. Otherwise, the species will become extinct or will have exponential growth. Though we, Homo sapiens, in fact experience population explosion, this is a rather rare situation among many species. In short-term evolution, population size is expected to fluctuate for any organism. Therefore, assumption of the constant population size is not realistic and is only for mathematical simplicity. We have to be careful about this sort of very simplistic assumptions inherent in many evolutionary theories. There are some more simplifications in the original coalescent theory: discrete generation and random mating. Random mating means that any gene copy is equal in terms of gene transmission to the next generation, and there is no subpopulation structure within the population of N individuals in question. These assumptions were also used for the Wright\u2013 Fisher model.",

We need to consider \u201cexact\u201d coalescence. The following explanation is after Fu [23]. If we consider a randomly mating population with constant size N, each gene copy at the present population was sampled from N gene copies of the previous generation with replacement. Therefore, if we choose one particular gene copy, say, copy ID 1, from the present population, the probability of its transmission from a specific gene copy of the previous generation is 1/N. Then, the probability of gene copy ID 2 from the present population not sharing the same parental copy with copy ID 1 is 1 \u2212 [1/N]. We then go to the next situation in which gene copy ID 3 from the present population shares the parental gene copy with neither ID 1 nor ID 2. Its probability becomes 1 \u2212 [2/N]. Applying a similar argument for IDs 4 to n (n \u2264 N), the probability, Prob[n \u2192 n, 1], that none of gene copies at the present generation shares the parental gene copy at the previous generation becomes5.20\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{Prob}}[n \\to n,1] \\, = \\prod\\limits_{{k = 1,n{-}1}} {\\left( {1 \\, {-} \\, \\left[ {k/N} \\right]} \\right)^{N} } $$\\end{document}\n5.21\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ = N_{[n]} /N^{n} $$\\end{document}\n5.22\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ N_{\\left[ n \\right]} = N\\left( {N{-}1} \\right)\\left( {N{-}2} \\right) \\ldots \\left( {N{-}n + 1} \\right) $$\\end{document}\n",

Because of this, we can check the implicit assumption of the constant population size. For example, the total number of human population as of 2018 A.D. is over 7 billion. If we apply the coalescent theory under the constant population model, the expected number of generations for coalescence of an autosomal gene, 4N, is 27 billion generations. If one generation is 20 years, the expected coalescent time becomes 540 billion years! This value is far greater than the start of this universe, i.e., Big Bang, approximately 14 billion years ago. This seemingly paradoxical situation simply comes from the population explosion, which violates the assumption of constant population size. To overcome this problem, the \u201ceffective population size\u201d is often used. Modern human is estimated to have ca. 10,000 as the effective population size (e.g., [24]). There are two books on the coalescent theory [25, 26]. We will discuss various applications of the coalescent theory in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-92642-1_18.",

That explanation assumed a constant population size for a long time and may not be appropriate for a long-term evolution. There is also a possibility of nonfixation as we discussed in 5.3.1. We can relax this assumption in Eq. 5.36. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic gene genealogy for a single lineage during time T. The vertical axis represents the whole population, and the population size N can vary. Star symbols are mutations accumulated in this single lineage, and thin dotted lines represent increase of allele frequency for each mutant. The total number of mutations accumulated during time T is \u03bcT. Fixation of each mutant is not necessary. Therefore, the evolutionary rate, \u03bb, of gene substitutions per generation should be \u03bcT/T = \u03bc, as shown in Eq. 5.36. This argument applies to any time irrespective of population size change. Even if speciation occurs, it does not affect this argument based on the single gene lineage. This is why we can consider the long-term evolution. Of course, any gene at the present population can be the starting point for the single lineage genealogy.

Now, new mutations appear by substituting one-nucleotide site, which was not changed before.

If mutations occur in DNA regions where important genetic information such as protein amino acids and RNA sequences is coded, or in highly conserved noncoding regions, these mutations may become deleterious, and the mutant individual may have less possibility of transmitting that gene to the offsprings.

As we will see, the fixation of selectively neutral mutations via stochastic effects is the main power of evolution, and the natural selection to choose advantageous mutations has only a limited contribution, although natural selection to eliminate deleterious mutations is quite effective to keep the current genetic entity.

Then, \u03bb[ rodents] = 0.15/[2 \u00d7 {10\u201320} million] = 4\u20138 \u00d7 10\u22129/site/year. Because mammalian genomes are mostly consisting of junk DNAs (see 5.7.2), genome-wide evolutionary rates are approximately mutation rate. It is clear that the mutation rate of rodents is several times higher than that for primates.",

Therefore, if f and/or \u03bc changes, the evolutionary rate should change, according to the neutral evolution. Figure 5.16 is the evolutionary history of rodent \u03b1 crystallin [44]. The amino acid sequence of this protein is identical among mouse, rat, and hamster, and their sequence is identical with that of common ancestor or all rodents. In marked contrast to that situation, nine amino acid substitutions accumulated in the mole rat lineage during 40 million years. Mole rat eye is diminished, and apparently, importance of \u03b1 crystallin, the major lens protein, is reduced. It is natural to expect higher fraction (f) of selectively neutral mutations for mole rat than other rodents whose eyes are necessary for their existence.\n",

As we saw in the evolution of fibrinopeptides, it is also possible that the effect of a nonsynonymous substitution may be very minor and essentially selectively neutral. It is therefore a good approximation that f (the fraction of neutral mutations) for synonymous mutations is 1, and the evolutionary rate is identical with mutation rate. As for nonsynonymous mutations, f is smaller than 1, and the evolutionary rate of nonsynonymous substitutions is expected to be smaller than that for synonymous substitutions. As we will see in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-92642-1_6, the evolutionary rate of nonsynonymous substitutions may become larger than the mutation rate when a special type of natural selection is operating, when any amino acid change is advantageous.

In fact, only 1.5% of the human genome is used for protein coding [48], and the rest are mostly junk. They are interspersed repeats (LINES and SINES), microsatellites, other intergenic regions, and introns (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-92642-1_12). A small fraction of noncoding genomic regions are highly conserved (e.g., [49\u201353]), and they are expected to have some functions such as enhancers. Even some SINE is known to obtain an important function during the mammalian evolution (e.g., [54, 55]). It is still true, however, that the majority of noncoding genomic regions are functionless, and just junk DNAs. There are reports of transcriptions on many noncoding regions (e.g., [56]). However, these results were obtained by problematic ChIP-chip techniques [57] and found to be artifact by checking ChIP-seq techniques [58]. Graur et al.

These two populations shared their common ancestor long time ago, and now allele frequencies on many loci are somewhat different between these two extant populations. Let us consider one particular locus with only two alleles 1 and 2. Allele frequencies in population A are A1 and A2 (A1 + A2 = 1) and those in population B are B1 and B2 (B1 + B2 = 1). Let us assume the Hardy\u2013Weinberg ratio in each population. Genotype frequencies of population A thus become A12, 2A1A2, and A22 for genotypes 11, 12, and 22, respectively, and those for population B are B12, 2B1B2, and B22, respectively. Now we ignore the population label, and consider allele frequencies (T1 and T2) of the total population T (populations A and B are combined) under a simplified assumption of equal population sizes for populations A and B. We then have T1 = (A1 + B1)/2 and T2 = (A2 + B2)/2. Expected frequencies for genotypes 11, 12, and 22 become T12, 2T1T2, and T22, respectively under the simple assumption of random mating in this total population assuming the Hardy\u2013Weinberg ratio. However, real genotype frequencies are (A12 + B12)/2, (2A1A2 + 2B1B2)/2, and (A22 + B22)/2 for genotypes 11, 12, and 22, respectively.

These were originally defined as correlations of genes [71]. Nei [72, 73] showed that these three fixation indices can be obtained from the means and covariances of allele frequencies by extending the Wahlund\u2019s principle. Nei [74] generalized by considering gene diversity and the mean of minimum genetic distances of Nei [75] and called it . Weir and Cockerham [76] also studied by extending Cockerham [77]. It should be noted that FST, which is now widely used as a measure of differentiation between two populations, was originally considered an average of population differentiation into many subpopulations.
