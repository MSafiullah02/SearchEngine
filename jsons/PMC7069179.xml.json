The widespread virus featured by the high mortality rate triggered a collective international response to halt the ongoing transmission [2, 3]. The international community launched multiple actions and invested millions of dollars in scaling up efforts, which were unprecedented for a disease outbreak [4, 5]. Facing the situation of no available vaccine and only limited ongoing drugs and diagnostics researches before the outbreak, supports for research and development (R&D) of relevant medical products were crucial not only for disease control and prevention, but also for reducing the social-economic threats from this fatal virus.",

Since then, the R&D for controlling the epidemic entered the speedway. After a collaborative and inclusive effort of regulators, scientists, and manufacturers, several medical products had been developed and demonstrated promising. Drug candidates such as ZMapp and TKM-Ebola showed antiviral efficacy in vitro and vivo, and were determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) for an emergency or compassionate use [7, 8]. In August 2019, another drug candidate REGN-EB3 was tested in a randomized, controlled trial, and delivered a low mortality rate of around 6.0% [9]. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was proven to be highly effective after its phase 3 trial [7, 10], and had already been deployed to the Democratic Republic of Congo during the 2018 Ebola outbreak under a compassionate use of the WHO\u2019s Expanded Access Framework [11]. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine yielded highly efficacious and protective results among high-risk contacts based on the fact that only 8.8% of the vaccinated population reported Ebola cases, and only 2.2% cases were reported 10 days or more after vaccination [12].",

Besides providing personnel and material assistance to the epidemic areas, China has facilitated the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutic drugs and vaccines for the Ebola virus. A restructured Ebola vaccine independently developed by China was approved by the former China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in November 2017 under the emergency use. China has become the third country with a developed vaccine to combat EVD after the United States and Russia. This significant breakthrough in Ebola-related R&D paves a smoother path for China to engage in the prevention and control of global EIDs.",

Some studies have introduced China\u2019s efforts on the development of certain drug and vaccine candidates for Ebola [14]. Others focused on its contribution to implementing prevention programs such as mobile laboratory [15]. However, previous published articles were limited to analyzing the Ebola-related R&D processes and funding flow in China [16]. This research aims to illustrate China\u2019s current situation and government support in implementing R&D response for Ebola by studying the timeline, input and output at each R&D stage. It will contribute to a deeper understanding of the R&D gaps and challenges faced by China, as well as providing evidence-based suggestions on how to accelerate the drug development process to meet urgent needs during future outbreaks. Moreover, this research could provide peer experience for other developing countries on promoting relevant R&D more effectively, which could contribute eventually to global EID prevention and control.",

Exclusion criteria included duplicated researches, researches on Ebola epidemic studies, emergency information platform studies, and other topics unrelated to Ebola R&D process. Since NSFC only supports pre-clinical research, the included projects were divided into \u201cBasic research\u201d and \u201cDevelopment\u201d according to the abstract. \u201cBasic research\u201d was then divided into \u201cEtiology research\u201d and \u201cPathogenesis research\u201d. \u201cEtiology research\u201d were studies that examine the cause and origin of the disease. In this case, etiology research mainly focused on the structure and the genome of the Ebola virus. \u201cPathogenesis research\u201d mainly emphasized the biological mechanism progress of the disease. To analyze the input status by each project category, \u201cDevelopment\u201d was divided into \u201cVaccine pre-clinical development\u201d, \u201cDiagnosis pre-clinical development\u201d and \u201cDrug pre-clinical development\u201d.

Notably, a proliferation of literature arose between 2014 and 2015, with a 1.7-fold increase in drug research and a 2.5-fold increase in diagnostic research annually.\n",

Due to NSFC\u2019s unique open-topic application and selective peer-review system, our results indicated inefficient awareness of preparedness for EID related R&D from both the scientists and the authorities. However, R&D for medical products is a time-consuming process, which moves much slower than the pandemic. Thus, performing a risk assessment to identify the potential EID threats and setting priorities for R&D preparedness is essential for the timely response [25\u201327]. Besides, the results spotted many Ebola-related research outputs were from other irrelevant projects before 2014. This issue might be explained by the limited national support on Ebola before its outbreak and the relatively slow process for new project funding approval. Establishing an emergency funding mechanism is one of the key determinants for accelerating the R&D process.",

Even though regulators have realized the importance of R&D translation, and launched the \u201cNew Drug Development Programme\u201d since 2008 with a total of CNY 128 billion (USD 18.21 billion), only a few projects focused on infectious disease, let alone EIDs [30].",

Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of public private partnership (PPP) [28, 31]. In China, public research institutions are the main actors for basic research, whereas private companies mainly work on development, candidate product manufacturing and massive production. For example, the successful R&D for the Ebola vaccine in China was developed by China\u2019s Academy of Military Medical Sciences, along with CanSino Biotech. However, PPP is still limitedly seen, especially for developing EID related countermeasures. Reasons might include limited incentives or support for academic institutions to transform research into products, as well as limited market incentives for private industries to invest in product development, especially when the development process requires international coordination. Our study showed that China spent nearly a year to complete the preparation for overseas clinical trials. Though the Chinese government has shown strong support for coordinating this overseas clinical trial, more mature clinical research partnerships should be established, like the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia initiated by NIAID [32]. Governmental supports are essential during EID-related R&D processes, especially in supporting overseas clinical trials, strengthening clinical research network, providing clinical training and accelerating the registrations to help survive the \u201cDead Valley\u201d [33], the period that most of the drugs fail from transforming basic researches to clinical trials.",

As discussed, China has taken multiple actions to support the domestic R&D processes, such as funding for basic research, and coordination for the overseas clinical trial. Moreover, the Chinese government has made great efforts to initiate special review regulations for the acceleration of Ebola products\u2019 approval. Comparing with the standard 150 workdays\u2019 time frame in China, the approval for Ebola vaccine only took 83 workdays, setting a new time record for New Drug Application approval at that time. Drug approval regulations might turn out to be a sufficient incentive for products without market returns. For example, the priority review voucher program for neglected tropical diseases has demonstrated valid for policymakers to encourage beneficial investments from industry [34, 35]. Similarly, China\u2019s review and approval system reform was aimed to stimulate industry innovation [36]. The timely approval process for Ebola vaccine reflected China\u2019s successful reforms on drug approval regulations for incentivizing new drug development and improving the efficient usage of medical countermeasures during the emergency. Besides the special review procedures, the government supports and coordination mechanism played an equally important role in accelerating the licensing process for candidate products. For example, the Clinical Department of the Food and Drug Administration could provide technical guidance and assistance during clinical trials, which would enhance the efficiency of data mining and experimental design.",
