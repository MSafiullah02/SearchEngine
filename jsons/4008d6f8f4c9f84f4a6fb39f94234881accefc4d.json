The sinusoids are infi ltrated either diffusely or in the form of small aggregates by mononuclear cells. Intrasinusoidal lymphocytosis often has a characteristic \"Indian-fi le\" appearance ( Fig. 64.2) . Liver cells are usually only mildly affected with scattered apoptotic bodies or foci of parenchymal necrosis fi lled with lymphocytes. Hepatocellular injury is clearly less pronounced than in acute viral hepatitis A or B. Regenerative changes and mitoses may be prominent. A steatosis or non-caseating, fi brin-ring granulomas rarely occur. Cholestasis is not part of the typical microscopical picture of EBV hepatitis, and if present should prompt one to search for granulomas [6] . The main histological differential diagnosis of EBV hepatitis is from leukemia or lymphoma.",
