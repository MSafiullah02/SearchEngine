Using search data can potentially overcome publication delay and help health facilities such as medical institutions and community health organizations to make preemptive and preventative treatment plans. Moreover, due to the secular stigma and discrimination against STDs, people at risk for infection tend to search for testing services and those infected tend to search for treatment and care services on the Internet as an initial step 6 , instead of attending health care facilities.",

In China there are also articles using Baidu search data to predict the incidence of HIV/AIDS [24] [25] [26] . These positive results made an inspiration for adopting more attempt such as multivariate time series analysis to explore more effective prediction. Baidu holds the highest search engine market penetration rate in China (93.1% in December, 2015) and 94.6% of the total 566 million search engine users search for information while using it 27 . It The vector autoregressive (VAR) model is one of the most flexible, and comprehensible models to analyze multivariate time series data. It could involve more than one variable and explain past and causal relationships among multiple variables over time, as well as predict future observations 28 . The structure is that each variable is a linear function of past lags of itself and past lags of the other variables. The incidence of diseases/infections and search data were usually auto-correlated itself and cross-correlated with the other. By evaluating the time lags, the final VAR model would include real incidence data and internet search data which has the potential ability to make the prediction more stable. However, there has been no studies using VAR model to predict the incidence of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea. We aimed to use Baidu search data through the VAR model-combining with previously notified incident case counts-to monitor and predict newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea, and compare the different incidence-search patterns.",

Compared with syphilis, the term of correlation was longer for both the number of newly diagnosed cases and search data in HIV/AIDS and gonorrhea models. It shall be noted that the prediction curve fitted well for HIV/AIDS because the uptrend was more stable. Shown from Figure 2 , there was a rise of incidence in 2017 for syphilis and gonorrhea, which was different from past years, making the prediction curve lower than true incidence curve.

It could involve more than one variable and explain past and causal relationships among multiple variables over time, as well as predict future observations 28 . The structure is that each variable is a linear function of past lags of itself and past lags of the other variables. The incidence of diseases/infections and search data were usually auto-correlated itself and cross-correlated with the other. By evaluating the time lags, the final VAR model would include real incidence data and internet search data which has the potential ability to make the prediction more stable. However, there has been no studies using VAR model to predict the incidence of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea. We aimed to use Baidu search data through the VAR model-combining with previously diagnosed cases-to monitor and predict newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea, and compare the different incidence-search patterns.",

Compared to traditional surveillance systems, this novel approach is more economical, simpler and timely 10 . It has been proven that various infectious diseases, including influenza 11-14 , dengue [15] [16] [17] [18] , and H7N9 19 , can be effectively monitored and predicted by models using Internet data. The sensitivity and specificity of search engine data-based monitoring or predicted results is on par with that of the traditional surveillance system 11 20 . It is invaluable to extend this innovative method to other diseases, including HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea that lead to significant morbidity, mortality, clinical outcomes, and with no existing vaccines 21 .",

The structure is that each variable is a linear function of its own past lags and the past lags of the other variables. The incidence of diseases/infections and search data were usually autocorrelated itself and cross-correlated with the other. By evaluating the time lags, the final VAR model would include real incidence data and Internet search data which have the potential to make the predictions more stable. However, there has been no studies using VAR model to predict the incidence of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea. We aimed to use Baidu search data in combination with previously diagnosed cases through a VAR model to monitor and predict newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea, and compare the different incidence-search patterns.",

Besides, the number of newly diagnosed cases of infectious diseases were auto-correlated and using multivariate model could explain the relationship by selecting an appropriate lag length.

Compared with syphilis, HIV/AIDS and gonorrhea models have a longer correlation between the number of newly diagnosed cases and search data. It shall be noted that because the uptrend was more stable, the prediction curve fitted well for HIV/AIDS. As shown in Figure 2 , there was a rise of incidence in 2017 for syphilis and gonorrhea, which was different from past years, making the prediction curve lower than true incidence curve. This may be caused by government's effort on publicity of health education and people's attention to syphilis and gonorrhea testing which were more likely to be deficient than HIV/AIDS in previous years.",

Official data on the number of newly diagnosed cases are released with delay. Whereas with time series analysis, we could make long-term prediction, providing time for health authorities and community health organizations to respond in advance. This advantage is of particular significance to the surveillance of infectious diseases.For infectious diseases, changes in the number of newly diagnosed cases are influenced by changing time trends, seasonal fluctuations and random disturbances26  .Time series analysis could potentially deal with these features by adding periodic term and error term. Besides, the number of newly diagnosed cases of infectious diseases were auto-correlated and using multivariate model could explain the relationship by selecting appropriate lag length.Figure 2depicted there were seasonal periodicity for all three HIV/STD, dropping abruptly from January to February which may attribute to the testing intention reduction of people during the Spring Festival, then going up from February and after several waves tending to be stable in December except of the",

Compared with syphilis, the term of correlation was longer for both the number of newly diagnosed cases and search data in HIV/AIDS and gonorrhea models. It shall be noted that the prediction curve fitted well for HIV/AIDS because the uptrend was more stable. Shown fromFigure 2, there was a rise of incidence in 2017 for syphilis and gonorrhea, which was different from past years, making the prediction curve lower than true incidence curve. This may be caused by government's effort on publicity of health education and people's attention on syphilis and gonorrhea testing which were more likely to be deficient than HIV/AIDS in previous years.The traditional official data is advised to be incorporated into the Internet search data. This can not only heal the peak of search volume trend, but partially remain out of the search volume caused by headlines such as celebrity anecdotes. Reliance on Internet data can potentially lead to miscalculation. With VAR model, we could avoid overestimation by inputting historical data resources such as the number of newly diagnosed cases of previous months.An existing study predicted new HIV diagnoses only using Baidu search data 25 , whereas we monitored and predicted the overall number of newly diagnosed cases for HIV/AIDS. For example, the keywords, 'How long can people survive with AIDS' and 'Is there a cure for AIDS', were more likely searched by already infected people for a period of time or AIDS patients.

According to the national reports on notifiable infectious diseases in China (available at http://www.chinacdc.cn/), there were 134 512 newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, 475860 of syphilis and 138855 of gonorrhea totally in 2017. These three STDs have significantly affected people's quality of life and caused immense economic burdens to the health care system 1 2 . These STDs are also listed as category B notifiable infectious diseases in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases 3 , which are subject to strict monitoring and management by the health authorities. The national surveillance system for infectious diseases in China has made substantial improvement since the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 4 , currently collecting data on a timelier and geographically-specific basis (used to be at city level, now at county/district level). Category B notifiable infectious diseases are required to be reported within 24 hours 5 , however there is a delay of publication of official statistics, i.e., 1-3 weeks for syphilis and gonorrhea, 2 month's for HIV/AIDS. Using search data can potentially overcome publication delay and help health facilities such as medical institutions and community health organizations to make preemptive and preventative treatment plans. Moreover, due to the secular stigma and discrimination against STDs, people at risk for infection tend For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",

The monthly syphilis and gonorrhea epidemic statistics, from the Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, was published monthly with 1-3 week's delay on its official website. Search volume data from Baidu The search volume data was obtained from the website of 'Baidu Index' (http://index.baidu.com/), a platform that shows the search volume from Baidu search engine using specific keywords in different time periods (minimum at day level) and regions (minimum at city level). In order to be consistent with the number of newly diagnosed cases, we chose the average nationwide Baidu index data of each month (the mean of the sum daily search index) for specific keywords from January 2011 to October 2017. Search volume of different keywords could vary to a large extent, thus we used the keywords selection and filtering method based on a study about influenza epidemic monitoring 12 . This study applied inclusion criteria to exclude irrelevant keywords and made correlation analysis between the number of newly diagnosed cases and search volume, instead of including all disease names and symptom-relevant keywords. such as 'The World AIDS Day' or 'The Population of AIDS patients in China', etc. 2.

The study using search data to predict newly diagnosed cases in China owed this phenomenon to increasing efforts and resources for HIV prevention to make people aware of risk25  .The uptrend of syphilis showed the efforts and resourcesThe selection of lag length for VAR models showed that the number of newlydiagnosed cases was influenced by the number of newly diagnosed cases and composite search index in previous two months for HIV/AIDS and gonorrhea, in last month for syphilis. For VAR model, it was difficult to interpret every coefficient of all regressors. The coefficients of trend term were all positive which illustrated an overall uptrend of the number of newly diagnosed cases for three infections/diseases during 2011-2017. In a cycle of full year, the number of newly diagnosed cases trend all showed periodicity for all infections/diseases which rose at the beginning of the year and fell back in January for next year at different speed. In addition, the peak value of HIV/AIDS appeared in every December may attribute to the free testing services on World AIDS Day.Figure 2showed the VAR models fitted well with the real data and the prediction could catch the periodicity and uptrend character especially for HIV/AIDS and gonorrhea.
