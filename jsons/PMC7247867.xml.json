            "text": "The interaction between economics and politics was not lost on early scholars of the EU. Already Ernst Haas (1958) expected economic integration to have profound political consequences. Following his neofunctionalist logic, steps towards economic integration in some sectors would have spillover effects for other sectors. Growing economic interdependence would lead to a shift in allegiances towards the new supranational institutions, in turn leading to ever more integration at the European level. More recently, Andrew Moravcsik (1998) also followed a political economy logic when explaining the process of European integration relying on his liberal intergovernmentalism. Liberal intergovernmentalism also sees economics as the driving force for integration: Economic actors lobby governments in line with their preferences to either further or halt integration in specific policy fields.",

            "text": "However, not only the broad theories of European integration rely on a political economy logic. Much research on specific policy fields, such as trade, investment, finance, and development aid, also draws on the basic idea that economics and politics are intertwined. Trade, as a policy field in which the EU has full competences, holds a particularly prominent role in studies of the political economy of the EU. Since becoming a customs union in the late 1960s, the EU has had the competence to speak for all member states on trade policy. For example, the EU has a representative at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and has negotiated almost 40 preferential trade agreements (PTAs) with countries spanning the entire globe (D\u00fcr et al. 2014). Correspondingly, the literature on the political economy of the EU on trade matters is impressive. Research investigates, among other things, the role the EU plays at the WTO (D\u00fcr and Zimmermann 2007; Poletti 2012; Poletti and De Bi\u00e8vre 2014), the (divergent) interests of member states in EU trade policy in general and with regard to PTAs more specifically (Elsig 2010; Elsig and Dupont 2012), the role of EU institutions in trade policy (De Bi\u00e8vre and D\u00fcr 2005; Meissner 2016), the role of interest groups or firms in influencing EU trade policy (D\u00fcr and De Bi\u00e8vre 2007; Eckhardt 2011), the effect of EU PTAs on non-trade issues, such as human rights or the environment (Bastiaens and Postnikov 2017; McKenzie and Meissner 2017; Postnikov and Bastiaens 2014), or the design of EU trade agreements (Lechner 2016).",

The great recession following the economic and financial crisis beginning in 2008 not only had immense real-world repercussions but also triggered huge scholarly interest. This literature often builds on an older strand of literature on the political economy of currency unions, which intensively discussed and analyzed the formation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) in the 1990s (Hallerberg 2002; Mosley 2004; Wyplosz 2001). In particular, new research aimed at evaluating what caused the crisis (Baldwin et al. 2015; for an overview see Copelovitch et al. 2016), what kind of policies were implemented to help alleviate the crisis and the distributive consequences attached to these policies (Bernhard and Leblang 2016; Walter 2016), the role of EU institutions such as the European Central Bank during the crisis (Genovese et al. 2016), how member state preferences towards the European Monetary Union changed before and after the crisis (Wasserfallen et al. 2019), the design and support or rather rejection of the bailout packages, especially for Greece (Bechtel et al. 2014; Walter et al. 2018), and what the economic crisis meant and still means for European integration more generally (Jones et al. 2016; Schimmelfennig 2018).",

The research carried out on this question closely resembles research dealing with individual level trade attitudes (for an overview see Nguyen and Spilker 2019). As European integration can at least partially be considered as moving towards more trade integration, numerous communalities exist between the driving forces of being pro-European and being pro-trade (or pro-globalization) more generally. This link is made most explicitly by Colantone and Stanig (2018), who evaluate the China shock on the decision to vote for Leave in the Brexit referendum and find that British regions more exposed to Chinese import-competition were more likely to vote for Brexit.",

Related to that, several studies aim at identifying a causal effect of immigration on voting behavior and voting for extreme parties in Austria (Halla et al. 2017), Denmark (Dustmann et al. 2019), Italy (Barone et al. 2016) and several other countries (Edo et al. 2019).

Independent of the exact scenario, the political decision to leave the EU has and will have substantial economic effects. The two most common approaches to gauge the expected economic effects of Brexit are to rely on general equilibrium trade models (Dhingra et al. 2017; Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr 2020) or stock market reactions (Breinlich et al. 2018; Davies and Studnicka 2018). The economic consequences of the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union will be clearly negative, economically relevant and unevenly distributed, with the United Kingdom and EU members more closely integrated with the UK suffering from a larger drop in international trade flows and real income (for instance Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr 2020).",

First indications of large economic gains from trade integration due to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in the early days of European integration helped to pave the way for the Treaties of Rome (1958) and the European Single Market establishing the famous four freedoms of free movement of goods, capital and persons as well as the freedom to establish and provide services. The economic and political economy literature is, however, by no means evenly distributed across these four freedoms. In particular, the economic effects of the free movement of goods are very well documented, indicating that the abolition of trade barriers within the EU customs union (e.g., Egger and Larch 2011; Berlingieri et al. 2018) and the elimination of exchange rate risk within the European Monetary Union (EMU) have clearly boosted trade in goods in Europe (e.g., Rose 2000; Nitsch 2002; Glick and Rose 2016; Polak 2019). In contrast, the empirical evidence on the free movement of capital (Lane 2006; Ehrmann et al. 2011; and Ehrmann and Fratzscher 2017), services (Dettmer 2015; Kern et al. 2018) and labor is rather scant (Dustmann et al. 2017; Beerli et al. 2020; Felbermayr et al. 2018).",

Not only countries but also firms and former politicians could gain economically from their ties to top EU decision makers, raising questions about post-employment restrictions at European institutions. Vaubel et al. (2012) demonstrate that many Commissioners take private sector jobs after their tenure and Luechinger and Moser (2020) find that firms hiring former European Commissioners benefit from these corporate appointments. There is also empirical evidence that nationality plays a role at the European Central Bank for hirings of top management positions (Badinger and Nitsch 2014), networking activity (Badinger and Nitsch 2019) and, most importantly, monetary policy decisions (Hayo and M\u00e9on 2013; Badinger and Nitsch 2014).",

Loosely speaking, strong negative economic effects of shocks that are unevenly distributed foster negative attitudes towards the EU. Since the current Covid-19 crisis will be accompanied by a serious economic \u2013 and potentially financial \u2013 crisis in many EU-member countries, this empirical evidence should serve as an important cautionary tale for European policy makers right now.",

But many other European institutions have received less attention and few studies have attempted to link the behavior of these institutions to political economy forces.

In a first contribution, Nils Redeker and Stefanie Walter (2020) address the question of why Germany, despite pressure from other countries, fails to rebalance its persistent current account surplus. Their response to this question is that the policies that would lead to adjustment, such as more public spending or higher minimum wages, would have strong distributional consequences within Germany. That is, some people would benefit from them, but others would lose. As a result, there is no agreement on how to achieve a balanced current account. In this situation, Germany opts for policies such as bailouts or debt haircuts, as they face least opposition. This paper thus is an example for political economy research that uses the distributional consequences of policies to explain the politics surrounding them.",

The authors differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for liberalization or reform. The former come from within the countries themselves and can be thought of as a cost-benefit analysis of further liberalization. The latter, however, are determined by the conditionality imposed by the organization. In the context of the EU, the Copenhagen Criteria as an entry barrier are an example of such extrinsic motivation in that the organization provides clear reform criteria that have to be met before the benefits of membership can be enjoyed. Using a formal model, Konstantinidis and Karagiannis show that extrinsic motivation, i.e. EU conditionality, can crowd out intrinsic motivations to reform. While this leads to short-term compliance, and thus membership, in the long term this crowding-out can even result in the reversal of reform progress. The accession of Greece to the EMU or of Hungary to the EU illustrate this pattern. Their conclusion that conditionality may be counter-productive in the long run seems not only relevant for the E(M) U, but also for the broader literature on conditionality to which the article connects nicely (e.g. Dreher 2009; Stubbs et al. 2020; Vreeland 2006). The idea that countries need to be intrinsically motivated, i.e. to own a reform as Konstantinidis and Karagiannis would call it, to make a reform process work, seems very relevant also for the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.",

Concretely, they explain variation across EU member states in how parliaments responded to the 2008 financial crisis. Their argument is that mainly the parliaments in EU member states that are not part of the Euro area and that face stark fiscal constraints should have increased their oversight of the EU\u2019s supranational institutions in response to the crisis. They use data on oversight mechanisms and on parliamentary debates in Germany, France, and Italy to test their argument. The paper nicely shows how an economic outcome (a financial crisis) can affect political institutions (and via political institutions probably also political outcomes). It thus directly addresses a gap in the literature on the political economy of the EU identified above, namely linking institutional outcomes to political economy forces.",

Aitor Erce, Giancarlo Corsetti and Timothy Uy (2020) discuss in detail how the European official sector policy response took shape, eventually leading to the foundation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in the year 2012. Thereby, the authors provide interesting insights into similarities and differences in the IMF and European policy responses. Furthermore, the authors gather a unique dataset of the characteristics of the various official loans and debt structure of those European countries hardest hit by the financial crisis. One important finding of this paper is that Euro area loans allowed for longer maturities and lower rates, improving the repayment profile, debt management and market access, a benefit to be weighed against moral hazard concerns.

The importance of this multilateral investment bank is often underestimated, considering its economic size and responsiveness relative to the EU budget. The authors investigate the allocation of loans across regions and sectors. They are interested in particular in the question of whether \u201chome regions\u201d of the Board of Directors of the EIB profit. Note that these directors do not serve at the EIB full-time. Hence, does the region where a given director works potentially receive a larger share of EIB-loans? Based on a new and rich dataset for about 500 individuals who have served on the EIB board, the empirical results are indeed consistent with such a \u201chome-bias\u201d. Out of the two broad channels that could underlie this effect, with one of them being benign (i.e., better information), favoritism is more likely to be at work. To conclude, this fine empirical study makes an important contribution to the political economy literature on European institutions and at the same time contributes to studying the political economy of investment decisions within the EU.",

This question is not only interesting from the angle that agriculture accounts for 40% of the EU\u2019s budget and therefore is a highly relevant but often understudied policy field. But also, from the perspective that many pundits and scholars alike call for DI as a way for the EU to make further integration possible without forcing those who do not want to further commit to turn their back on the union. Given that in a union of 27 member states heterogeneity of preferences can easily create deadlock in negotiations, DI can be a solution by offering member states to cooperate at different levels of integration. In the context of agricultural policy, Malang and Holzinger argue, however, that DI in fact equals more protection because over the years the EU has tried to become less protectionist in its agricultural policy. Their results indeed suggest that the size of the agricultural sector is the most important factor in shaping demand for DI. However, this demand is mediated by the bargaining power of the respective country in that countries that are economically stronger can use this bargaining power to deliver higher levels of DI to their agricultural sector. In showing that relevant subnational interests are important determinants of EU-level outcomes, the study of Malang and Holzinger closes the circle nicely to the first study in this special issue by Redeker and Walter.",

First, two of the articles (Erce et al. 2020; Asatryan and Havlik 2020) study EU institutions that are \u2013 despite their economic importance \u2013 rarely in the focus of academic research. The fact that the ESM will play a decisive role in the current Covid-19 crisis only underscores the importance of studying this institution in more detail. Second, the study by Malang and Holzinger (2020) reminds us that the policy field of agriculture \u2013 despite its importance in relation to the EU budget \u2013 often receives too little attention in comparison to other policy areas, such as trade, investment or finance. An additional contribution of the Malang and Holzinger study, which is also an important part of the study by Redeker and Walter (2020), is to combine the analysis of bargaining power with domestic interests. This is an important addition to the more general IPE literature, which either mostly focuses on bargaining power (as a state level characteristic) or domestic interest (such as firms or industries) but rarely on the interplay of the two. Finally, the studies by Konstantinidis and Karagiannis (2020) as well as by Genovese and Schneider (2020) broaden our understanding of the Euro crisis either by tying the origins of the crisis to the accession of countries to the EMU or by evaluating the consequences of the crisis on national parliaments.",

As of now, the economics and political science strands of literature largely co-exist. The two strands do increasingly cite each other, which is a positive development. Actual research cooperation across the two disciplines in researching the EU, however, is still exceedingly rare. Such explicit cooperation, for example, would be useful if economic research allows for precise predictions about the preferences of economic actors, and political science research uses these predicted preferences to develop expectations about political outcomes.",

Only a small part of the research on the EU, in turn, explicitly draws on IPE research. Bringing these literatures together would allow us to figure out to what extent the EU is unique, and to what extent findings from research on countries or other international organizations can apply to the EU. There are only few exceptions to this, among them research contrasting the EU and the US approaches to enforcing environmental protection via PTAs (Bastiaens and Postnikov 2017) and a study on how membership in the UN Security Council matters for the EU\u2019s budget (Mikulaschek 2018).",

Traditionally, many empirical studies in this field have relied on either cross-country, cross-region, cross-industry variation or variation over time in order to identify and quantify the economic effects of European integration. Obviously, these studies are very informative about the average costs and benefits of European integration, but they usually cannot address the distributional effects within a country. Hence, we encourage new empirical studies based on firm- or individual-level data that isolate EU-policy shocks from other shocks, for instance, due to globalization more generally. Using specific EU-policy changes in conjunction with micro-level data would allow us to learn more about the distributional consequences of EU integration within EU member countries.",

This is what already happens in the field of IPE, where the findings from heterogeneous firm and worker models have found their way into research on both individual-level trade attitudes and firm-level trade lobbying. For the case of the EU, by contrast, so far only few studies have followed this approach, at least partly because the EU policy shocks are not as well understood as the more general globalization shock. A combination of economic and political science expertise could hence produce significant new insights concerning the link between the distributional effects of the EU on the one hand and individual-level attitudes and lobbying behavior on the other hand.",
