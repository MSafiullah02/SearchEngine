Among the newer members of the family, the genus Quaranjavirus was created to include viruses detected in ticks and birds from various locations around the world including the Johnston Atoll virus from the central Pacific Ocean and Quaranfil virus from Egypt (Presti et al., 2009). More recently, viruses belonging to a proposed genus, Influenzavirus D, have been described from cattle in France and swine and cattle in the United States (Ducatez et al., 2015). In addition, next-generation sequencing methods are beginning to reveal the presence of many novel viruses in arthropods including 13 quaranjaviruses and an unclassified cockroach orthomyxovirus closest to the thogotovirus cluster (Li et al., 2015). Very recently, an orthomyxovirus-like virus has been described from mass die-offs of tilapia in Israel and Ecuador. Surprisingly, the genome of the tilapia lake virus (TiLV) consisted of 10 RNA segments with the closest polymerase sequence identity to that of influenzavirus C virus (Bacharach et al., 2016).",

The genome segments range in length from 874 to 2396 nucleotides having partial complementarity in their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-terminal sequences. Typically, two large basic and one acidic polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) are encoded and interact to form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Orthomyxoviruses also contain a surface glycoprotein (GP) with functions that vary in differing genera to include hemagglutination (HA), esterase activity (HE) and envelope fusion (HEF). Members of the genera Influenzavirus A and Influenzavirus B have a second envelope glycoprotein, a neuraminidase (NA), which contains sialidase activity (Suzuki et al., 2005) while others may have a fusion protein (F) that lacks sialidase activity (Aspehaug et al., 2005). Two membrane or matrix proteins are encoded from the same RNA segment, the M1 protein is a non-glycosylated matrix protein while M2 functions as a proton-selective ion channel protein (International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, 2005). In addition, another RNA segment typically encodes two non-structural proteins that include NS1 that serves as an antagonist of the type I interferon response and NS2, a putative nuclear export protein (NEP).",

To date, all isolates of ISAV belong to a single species within the genus Isavirus. This study describes the isolation and characterization of another fish orthomyxovirus, RbtOV, of rainbow and steelhead trout (both Oncorhynchus mykiss), that appears to be a member of a novel virus species that, while most like ISAV, is sufficiently distinct to merit consideration as a member of a new genus, proposed name Mykissvirus, in the family Orthomyxoviridae.",

Because the virus type was initially unknown, attempts were made at amplifying extracted viral RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using in-house sets of DNA primers designed from sequences of known fish viruses (rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, orthomyxovirus, nidovirus, bunyavirus, picornavirus, hepevirus or aquareovirus), but performing the reverse transcription and annealing at lower stringencies. The PCR conditions used were similar to those for the fish virus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (World Organization for Animal Health, 2009) that include lower annealing temperatures so that primers do not require exact base pairing. Conditions for RT-PCR were: 30 min reverse transcription at 40 \u00b0C followed by 2 min denaturation at 95 \u00b0C, then 30 amplification cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 40 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 60 s, and followed by final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. Four primer sets produced amplicon bands and the nidovirus primer set yielded an amplicon with a sequence that BLAST searches showed was similar to the PB1 gene of orthomyxoviruses. Using this authentic sequence, new primers were developed to use in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) techniques (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to gain sequences directed toward both ends of the PB1 gene segment of RbtOV-1.",

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed with RAxML v8.1.22 (Stamatakis, 2015) using the rapid tree search algorithm and the general time-reversible substitution model for nucleotide sequence data and the Blosum62 model for amino acid sequence data (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). Phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian MCMC methods was performed using the BEAST software package v1.8.0 (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007). For all Bayesian analyses, a strict clock prior and the speciation birth-death process with incomplete sampling tree prior was used (Stadler, 2009). The substitution models were the HKY model for nucleotide sequence data (Hasegawa et al., 1985) and the Blosum62 model for amino acid sequence data (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). The phylogenetic tree is derived from three separate MCMC analyses of 150 million generations that each achieved convergence and good mixing, and were subsequently combined, summarized, and analyzed.

No efforts were made to test the susceptibility of other cell lines to either the RbtOV-1 or SttOV-1 isolates including fish cell lines commonly used to support the growth of ISAV (e.g. SHK-1, ASK-2). However, these fish orthomyxoviruses are somewhat similar to North American strains of ISAV that also replicate in the CHSE-214 cell line (Bouchard et al., 1999, Kibenge et al., 2000).",

However, portions of segments 5 through 8 could be determined by sequencing RT-PCR amplicons generated using gene-specific primer sets made from conserved regions of other orthomyxovirus segments. All eight segments of the RbtOV-1 isolate were completely sequenced by traditional Sanger sequencing methods and 5\u2032 RACE techniques were used to obtain the exact terminal sequences.

Nearly complete complementarity was present for the seven terminal nucleotides (UCGUUUC) of each RbtOV-1 segment, while good complementarity was observed for up to 24 nucleotides from each genomic terminus. The consensus sequence for each terminus included 16 of 24 identical nucleotides (Fig. 4).

However, both sites are in adequate context for translation initiation at positions \u22122 and \u22123 (Kozak, 1991) and both maintain similar reverse complementarity with the other termini even though coding for amino acids.

Surprisingly, the NP of RbtOV had a calculated pI of 8.7, although long stretches of acidic residues were observed such as \u201cEEEEEEAQEE\u201d beginning at nt 296. The pI for the NP of RbtOV was similar to that of ISAV at 8.3, but less basic than the other orthomyxoviruses that range from 9.4\u20139.6 (Table 3). Pairwise alignments indicated that the NP of RbtOV had relatively low amino acid identity with orthologs in other members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, ranging from 19% for Thogotovirus, 18\u201322% for influenzaviruses, and 23% for ISAV (Fig. 3).",

For ISAV, an ortholog of the NA has been characterized and is also located on the fifth largest segment, although it is not known to have sialidase activity and is thus termed a fusion (F) protein (Aspehaug et al., 2005). The orf encoding the NA of RbtOV begins with an AUG in strong initiation context, producing a predicted protein of 480 aa. The predicted amino acid sequence of the neuraminidase of RbtOV produced alignments having a 23\u201324% identity with the NA of influenzavirus A or B (Fig. 3). The three viruses shared nine conserved cysteine residues in the carboxyl half of the protein, reminiscent of a zinc finger domain present among the V proteins of several paramyxoviruses (Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001). Surprisingly, the RbtOV neuraminidase sequence showed no significant similarity to any ISAV protein, although manually, a 16% amino acid identity could be obtained by pairwise comparison with that of the F protein of ISAV. An unusually high number of threonine residues were predicted to be encoded in the RbtOV neuraminidase, 14%, compared to the other proteins of the virus where threonine content ranged from only 4\u20138%. This was especially evident for aa 52\u201389 of the NA, where 21 threonine residues out of 38 residues (55%) were located. As shown in Table 3, the neuraminidase of RbtOV was somewhat acidic (pI 6.0) compared to the F protein of ISAV or the NA of influenzaviruses A and B (pI 7.0\u20138.1). While the sialidase activity of RbtOV was not tested, BLAST searches using the full amino acid sequence of the RbtOV neuraminidase indicated it was most like the NA of the N3 strains of influenzavirus A and related to the sialidase superfamily of proteins having sialidase propeller motifs 2\u20136. Four N-linked glycosylation sites were identified in the amino acid sequence of the RbtOV neuraminidase, similar to the four or five sites found in the NA of influenzavirus A or B and greater than the two present in the NA of ISAV (Table 3).",

For members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, the function of this protein, whether involved in hemagglutination, neutralization, envelope fusion, or esterase activity, varies with the genus. The HA gene of RbtOV contains an orf beginning with an AUG in adequate initiation context only nine nucleotides from the leader terminus and within the region of complementarity, a feature similar to that of ISAV (Merour et al., 2011). Initiation at this start site is predicted to encode a protein of 464 aa (Table 1). The next strong, in-frame AUG codon is at nt 156 and may serve as an alternate start for protein synthesis. The predicted amino acid sequence of the RbtOV hemagglutinin did not produce a significant match with any orthomyxovirus sequence in the NCBI database when searched using BLASTp. Instead, the percent amino acid identities ranged between 20 and 24% for all of the representative orthomyxoviruses compared (Fig. 3), including ISAV, which has esterase activity, and thogotovirus, which has a glycoprotein (GP75), that is not closely related to the influenza virus HA. However, Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) selected to query virus proteins, revealed several viral envelope glycoproteins that did show significant similarity to the HA of RbtOV such as koala retrovirus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, and bat coronavirus. This may be due to similarities in the leucine zipper and heptad repeat features, more common to fusion proteins.",

            "text": "Two viral membrane or matrix proteins of RbtOV are encoded on the smallest segment 8 and were identified as putative M1 and M2 (Table 1). The first AUG (+2 frame) at nt 38 begins an orf that encodes a smaller protein of 207 aa with a predicted mass of 23.2 kDa (M1). The second AUG (+1 frame) at nt 88 begins an orf that encodes a larger protein of 235 aa with a predicted mass of 25.6 kDa (M2). Based primarily on the location of the two orfs, predicted protein sizes, and amino acid alignments, the matrix proteins of RbtOV showed the greatest similarity to their ISAV orthologs, but the percent amino acid identities between the sequences encoding these two proteins was low (20\u201321%) for both the M1 and M2 (Fig. 3). However, the amino acid sequences revealed no significant matches with any orthomyxoviruses when analyzed using BLASTp. Pairwise alignments of the RbtOV matrix proteins with orthologs of other representative orthomyxoviruses were also low for M1 (16\u201321%) and M2 (20\u201327%). Both the M1 and M2 proteins of RbtOV were predicted to be highly basic with a pI of 9.4. While this appears similar to the M1 proteins of ISAV and influenzaviruses that range from pI 9.2\u20139.7, it was unlike the M2 proteins of ISAV and other representative influenzaviruses that are typically quite acidic with a range from pI 4.4\u20135.7 (Table 3). The deduced M1 amino acid sequence of RbtOV-1 contains three N-linked glycosylation sites, whereas the M2 protein only has one.",

            "text": "Phylogenetic analyses of aligned nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the RbtOV-1 isolate with representative orthomyxoviruses allowed separation into the anticipated genera of Orthomyxoviridae. Both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, using either the complete PB1 nucleotide sequence or the deduced amino acid sequence, produced trees with similar topologies. These analyses indicated that RbtOV and SttOV are isolates of the same virus species and most closely related to ISAV, the sole species within the genus Isavirus (Fig. 6\n). Further analyses with additional viral genes would aid in confirmation of this finding. This relationship is further supported by evidence that RbtOV has the same genome segment order as that of ISAV as well as the closest percent amino acid identities for most of the other encoded proteins. However, the overall levels of nucleotide or amino acid sequence identities between RbtOV/SttOV and ISAV shown in Fig. 3 are sufficiently low to indicate they are clearly separate virus species. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of the PB1 sequences of RbtOV and SttOV with other known orthomyxoviral taxa revealed that the distances between RbtOV/SttOV and other taxa are greater than the intragenic diversity of any of the established genera within the family Orthomyxoviridae. Consequently, we could not assign RbtOV/SttOV into any previously described genus and the viruses potentially represent prototypes in a new genus, tentatively named Mykissvirus based on the species name of the original host, pending ICTV approval.",

Additionally, a partial PB1 sequence from a second isolate of RbtOV from rainbow trout (RbtOV-2) and a nearly complete genome of a third isolate from steelhead trout (SttOV-1) were compared to the initial isolate of RbtOV and to other orthomyxoviruses. These isolates appear to be members of the same virus species and sufficiently distinct from other orthomyxoviruses to merit consideration as a member of a new genus in the family Orthomyxovirdae. In vitro growth conditions were optimized, a plaque assay developed for infectious virus quantification, and a reverse transcription \u2013 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was modified for detection and identification of similar fish orthomyxoviruses in the future.",
