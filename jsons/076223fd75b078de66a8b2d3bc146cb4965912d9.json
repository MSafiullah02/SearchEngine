Methods: Non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests admitted between 7 February and 12 February 2020 to Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital, which was promptly constructed because of the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, were included; clinical course through to 22 February was recorded. Results: A total of 1012 non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were included in the study. Thirty (of 1012, 3.0%) individuals were asymptomatic on admission. During hospitalization, 16 of 30 (53.3%) asymptomatic individuals developed different symptoms. Fourteen of 1012 patients (1.4%) remained asymptomatic from exposure to the end of follow up, with a median duration of 24 days (interquartile range 22e27). Fever (761 of 1012, 75.2%) and cough (531 of 1012, 52.4%) were the most common symptoms. Small patchy opacities (355 of 917, 38.7%) and ground-glass opacities (508 of 917, 55.4%) were common imaging manifestations in chest CT scans. One hundred patients (9.9%) were transferred to designated hospitals due to aggravation of illness. Diarrhoea emerged in 152 of 1012 patients (15.0%). Male, older age, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chills, dyspnoea, SO 2 value of 93%, white blood cell counts of >10 \u00c2 10 9 /L and large consolidated opacities on CT images were all risk factors for aggravation of illness. Conclusions: Non-critically ill individuals had different clinical characteristics from critically ill individuals. Asymptomatic infections only accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19. Although with a low incidence, diarrhoea was observed in patients with COVID-19, indicating the possibility of faecal eoral transmission. X.

Given the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients, the prompt construction of temporary Fangcang hospitals was required. Medical personnel at Fangcang hospitals came from all over the country to work shifts lasting between 6 and 8 hours. Fangcang hospitals were usually reconstructed using large-scale spaces such as exhibition halls, gymnasiums and workshops to have the basic functions of medical treatment, logistic support, patient beds and living area. Patients from 7 to 12 February 2020, at Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital in Wuhan, were enrolled in the retrospective study. Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital was managed by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. All individuals with COVID-19 recruited in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020081K). Written informed consent was waived by the institutional ethics board of the hospital for emerging infectious diseases, but oral consent was obtained from all the participants. Clinical courses were followed until 22 February.",

Asymptomatic people might easily be ignored and are potentially infectious. It had been reported that asymptomatic individuals could spread the disease to family members [13] , indicating that timely isolation of asymptomatic infected people was important for epidemic prevention and control. Third, diarrhoea was an atypical symptom of low incidence in COVID-19 patients. In some published studies, incidence of diarrhoea in patients with COVID-19 ranged from 2% to 10% [9, 11, 14, 15] . Our percentage was higher than in those studies, perhaps explained by the use of some drugs such as abidol and moxifloxacin before admission to the Fangcang Hospital. Recent studies found positive SARS-CoV-2-RNA in anal swabs and faecal samples and found that positive results of anal swabs were associated with disease severity [16, 17] . Although it was unclear whether there was a definite link between diarrhoea and COVID-19, both studies raise a question concerning whether the gastrointestinal tract might be another site of viral replication, indicating the possibility of faecaleoral transmission.",
