            "text": "About 45% to 65% of patients with SCAP have coexisting illnesses. Conversely, patients who are chronically ill have an increased likelihood of developing a complicated pneumonic illness4 (Table 38-1\n). The most common chronic illnesses in these patients are respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, certain habits, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse, also are common in those with SCAP. Indeed, cigarette smoking has been identified as a risk factor for bacteremic pneumococcal infection.5 Other common illnesses in those with CAP include malignancy and neurologic disorders (including seizures). Milder forms of pneumonia may be more severe on presentation if patients have not received antibiotic therapy before hospital admission. In addition, the ability to contain the infectious challenge, which may be related to genetic differences in the immune response, may predispose certain individuals to more severe forms of infection and adverse outcomes. This may be reflected in a family history of severe pneumonia or adverse outcomes from infection.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 It appears likely that SCAP results when inflammation is either insufficient to contain the infection or so exuberant that the host response affects the uninvolved lung (leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome) or the systemic circulation (leading to severe sepsis).8\n",

            "text": "The most commonly used predictors of outcome from pneumonia are two scoring systems, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)15 and the British Thoracic Society rule.16 The latter rule recently has been modified to the CURB-65 score. This is an acronym for the following: confusion, serum urea nitrogen level higher than 19.6 mg/dL, respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute or higher, low systolic (\u226490 mm Hg) or diastolic (\u226460 mm Hg) blood pressure, and age older than 65 years. These two scoring systems are valid in identifying patients at low risk for mortality. Each, however, has limitations. These limitations are most apparent when the systems are used to identify those with SCAP. Ideally, the two complement one another.17 The PSI heavily weights age and comorbidity but does not necessarily measure the severity of acute illness, relying on vital sign abnormalities that fall either above or below a dichotomous variable threshold. Thus, it may overestimate severity of illness in older patients and underestimate severity in younger individuals without comorbid illness. Conversely, the CURB-65 criteria may not adequately consider the presence of comorbid illness, particularly those in which pneumonia has induced decompensation.",

However, the CURB-65 appeared to be more discriminating in defining mortality risk in the severely ill.20 Another study by Espa\u00f1a and colleagues used both the PSI and the CURB-65 to evaluate a large number of inpatients and outpatients with CAP.21 In this investigation, the CURB-65 (and its simpler CRB-65 version, which excludes measurement of BUN and thus can be used in outpatients) accurately predicted 30-day mortality, the need for mechanical ventilation, and perhaps the need for hospitalization. In addition, the CURB-65 criteria correlated with the time to clinical stability. Thus, a higher score predicted a longer duration of intravenous therapy and a longer length of hospital stay. The PSI predicted mortality. However, as demonstrated in other studies, the PSI was not good at predicting the need for ICU admission. Espa\u00f1a and colleagues found that the CURB-65 also could not predict the need for ICU admission reliably. However, other investigators found the CURB-65, although still limited, to be more accurate than the PSI for predicting need for ICU admission.19\n",

The investigators found that when patients were admitted to the ICU, they tended to get more of their PSI points from acute rather than chronic illness. The reverse was true for those PSI class V patients who were not admitted to the ICU. Data from patients with CAP admitted to two tertiary hospitals in Texas23 analyzed retrospectively demonstrated that, although the patients in the ICU had a higher PSI score than the ward patients, the ICU patient cohort (145 patients) included patients in all PSI classes, with 30% falling into low-risk PSI groups (classes I to III). These findings are similar to data reported by Ewig and associates,19 indicating that the PSI was good for predicting CAP mortality but not for determining the need for ICU care.

These included confusion, BUN greater than 30 mg/dL, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/minute, Pao\n2/Fio\n2 ratio less than 250, multilobar infiltrates, and age at least 80 years.

Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) is a concern with exposure to parturient cats, cattle, sheep, or goats; Francisella tularensis is a concern with rabbit exposure; hantavirus with exposure to mice droppings in endemic areas; Chlamydia psittaci with exposure to turkeys or infected birds; and Legionella species with exposure to contaminated water sources (saunas). After influenza superinfection with pneumococcus, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) and Haemophilus influenzae should be considered. With travel to endemic areas in Asia, the onset of respiratory failure after a viral illness should lead to suspicion of a viral pneumonia, which could be severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza.

These findings are not specific for pneumonia and generally cannot help define an etiologic pathogen. Thus, microbiologic data are needed.4 Although chest radiographic patterns generally are not useful for identifying the etiology of CAP, certain findings such as pleural effusion (pneumococcus, H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae, pyogenic streptococci) and cavitation (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, anaerobes, MRSA, tuberculosis) can suggest certain groups of organisms. It often is difficult to define the etiologic pathogens in patients with CAP because up to half of such patients have no identified etiology even with extensive diagnostic testing that includes cultures of blood and sputum. Although there is controversy about the value of diagnostic testing in patients with CAP, extensive routine testing is recommended for those admitted to the ICU.2 Several studies have shown that establishing an etiologic diagnosis does not improve the outcome of SCAP and that outcome is only improved if empirical and broad-spectrum early therapy is given, targeting the likely etiologic pathogens. However, diagnostic testing may have value for the purpose of narrowing and focusing therapy and for guiding management in the patient who is not responding to empirical therapy.38\n",

In some situations, Gram stain can be used to broaden initial empirical therapy by enhancing the suspicion for organisms that are not covered by routine empirical therapy (such as S. aureus, suggested by clusters of gram-positive cocci, especially during a time of epidemic influenza). Routine serologic testing is not recommended. However, in patients with severe illness, the diagnosis of Legionella species infection can be made by urinary antigen testing because this is the test most likely to be positive at the time of admission. One shortcoming is that this test is specific only for serogroup I infection.2 Examination of concentrated urine for pneumococcal antigen also may be valuable. In cases in which viral etiology is suspected, influenza direct fluorescent antibody testing can be performed, and the result is usually available in few hours. For other respiratory viruses, testing might be of use, particularly in the setting of outbreaks.4 Bronchoscopy is not indicated as a routine diagnostic test but may be needed in some patients with severe forms of CAP to establish an etiologic diagnosis in order to focus the initially broad-spectrum empirical therapy to a simpler regimen.2\n",

However, patients admitted from a nursing home still may have infections caused by atypical pathogens and Legionella species.44,\n45 Some patients with HCAP have pathogens similar to SCAP, whereas others have pathogens similar to severe nosocomial pneumonia. Therapy varies accordingly. Some examples of HCAP patients at high risk for MDR pathogens are those with prior antibiotics exposure (within the past 3 to 6 months), those with poor functional status, and those with recent hospitalization.46, 47, 48\n",

Currently, most penicillin resistance in the United States is of the \u201cintermediate\u201d type (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/L) rather than the high-level type (penicillin MIC of 2.0 or more).50 Pneumococcal resistance to other antibiotics, including macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, also is common, but the clinical relevance and effect on outcome of these in vitro findings are uncertain. One study, corroborated by the opinion of many experts, found that only organisms with a penicillin MIC higher than 4 mg/L were associated with an increased risk for death.51 In a prospective international study of 844 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia,52 in vitro resistance to \u03b2-lactams was associated with little in the way of clinical impact. Discordant therapy with penicillins, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone did not result in a higher mortality. However, discordant therapy with cefuroxime led to a worse clinical outcome than if the organism were sensitive to this agent. Although DRSP is common, quinolone resistance is unusual. Doern and associates50 observed that, although penicillin resistance was present in 34.2% of pneumococci, quinolone resistance was rare. However, 21% of organisms had a single first-step mutation (par C) that did not confer resistance but could predispose to clinical resistance in the presence of a second mutation (gyr A). This situation mandates close observation.",

In addition, those admitted to the ICU can have infection with atypical pathogens that can account for up to 20% of infections, either as primary infection or as copathogens. The identity of these organisms varies with time and geography. In some areas, Legionella species is a common cause of SCAP, whereas in others, C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae infection predominates.4 Other important causes of SCAP include H. influenzae, S. aureus, MRSA (especially after influenza), and enteric gram-negative bacteria (including P. aeruginosa). Risk factors for gram-negative bacteria include underlying COPD (especially with corticosteroid therapy), recent hospitalization, prior antibiotics, bronchiectasis, and the presence of HCAP.47 The specific risks for P. aeruginosa include the presence of structural lung disease (bronchiectasis), COPD, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics within 7 days of presentation, chronic steroid use, malignancy, and malnutrition.2,\n47 Rapid radiographic spread of the disease is also a clue to the presence of P. aeruginosa infection. In a multicenter Spanish study of 529 patients with SCAP, 15 of 20 patients (75%) with P. aeruginosa had rapidly progressive illness because antimicrobial treatment at admission was inadequate.53\n",
