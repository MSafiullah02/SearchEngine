However, for all three, the respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, one neonate had repeated testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies, and the observed rapid decline of IgG levels within 14 days, along with a decline in IgM antibodies, strongly suggested that All rights reserved.

These findings are comparable to what have been observed in nonpregnant cases. 33 A recent case-series reported on maternal death of seven pregnant women presenting with severe COVID-19 during the latter second and third trimester over a 30-day interval in Iran. 34 All cases received a three-drug regimen, which included oseltamivir 75 mg PO every 12 hours for 5 days, hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg PO daily or chloroquine sulfate 1000 mg tablet PO as a single dose and lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg PO every 12 hours for 5 days. There were two key distinguishing features from these cases. First, the average maternal age of this series (36.7 + 7.3 years versus 30.3 + 3.6 years) was higher than others. Second, none of the pregnant patients had pre-existing co-morbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and asthma. 34 The authors believed that the COVID-19-infected pregnant patients did not receive suboptimal care and raised concern regarding the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the latter trimester. Notably, the authors did not provide details of cause(s) of death. 34 This systematic review had several strengths. We undertook a meticulous process in identifying duplicate reporting: (i) case reports from China were excluded, (ii) when a hospital had published their cases more than once, only the paper with the biggest data or published on the later date was included, (iii) we were able to identify the duplicates from our own publication, 11 which is the biggest cohort series with available pregnancy outcome data from China and (iv) when necessary we contacted the corresponding authors using their native language, i.e. Chinese and Spanish, thus increasing the chance of receiving a response from them. We did not apply any language restrictions in order to capture a global picture of the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes and most importantly we had the capability to ensure that data from China could be accurately interpreted and recorded. There were several major limitations. We were unable to include the second biggest cohort series with available pregnancy outcome data from China because the data were pooled from a national registry. 35 Despite contacting the corresponding author directly, it was not possible to identify the actual sources of cases.

In our publication we included 77 cases from Wuhan and we had strong reasons to believe that there was significant overlap between the two series, and therefore we regrettably had to exclude the data from Chen et al in order to avoid inflating the number of COVID-19-infected pregnant cases in China. We also learned that COVID-19-infected pregnant cases could have been transferred to other hospitals, which made it difficult to determine duplicate reporting as cases could have been reported by both the admitting and receiving hospitals. We decided to combine laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases in our analysis because both groups had similar outcomes. 11 We believed it was important to include the clinically diagnosed cases in this review as clinically diagnosed cases had typical COVID-19 chest CT findings and significant epidemiological exposure. Only two cases of maternal death had been reported, as of April 23, 2020, in the literature. Traditionally any maternal death requires an extensive process of investigation and therefore it is not immediately reported and made public.

The majority of cases received antibiotic therapy, whilst the minority of cases received antiviral therapy and corticosteroids. Few cases received hydroxychloroquine. There were no cases of maternal death from the case-series. Almost all cases from the case-series had positive CT chest findings. On admission, the majority of cases had normal or low leucocytes, whilst half had lymphocytopenia and increased C-reactive protein (CRP). Of note, there were six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported by Karami et al. and Zamaniyan et al. from Iran. 21,22 The first case was a",

The findings of the case of maternal death reported by Zamaniyan et al, 22 where amniotic fluid and neonatal nasal and throat swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the case-report by Alzamora et al, 23 where neonatal throat swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, have again raised the possibility of vertical transmission. The authors of the former case-report could not measure specific antibodies in the neonate, which might have provided supplementary evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This case is of particular interest because the pregnant patient might have had virulent COVID-19, which was not immediately apparent prior to delivery as her clinical course only dramatically deteriorated after delivery. There appear at least two ways through which SARS-CoV-2 can cause intrauterine infection by vertical transmission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has recently been indicated as the putative surface receptor of sensitive cells for SARS-CoV-2, 29 has been shown to be expressed in human placentas. 30 This opens up the possibility for SARS-CoV-2 to spread transplacentally through ACE2. Specifically, the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to facilitate efficiency of entry and viral replication, there is emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 co-opts and recruits additional host proteases for transmissibility. 31,32 It is however unknown whether there is placental expression of host proteases (such as TMPRSS2 and others) necessary for cleavage of the S protein and receptor priming. On the other hand, placental barrier damage caused by severe maternal hypoxemia in women with COVID-19 infection could also be one potential way through which SARS-CoV-2 can cause intrauterine infection. There is an urgent need to further investigate the possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [R,R].The second case of maternal death that was reported by Karami et al underwent autopsy and histopathologic evaluation of paraffin embedded lung tissue that showed alveolar spaces with focal hyaline membrane, pneumocyte proliferation, and metaplastic changes.21  There was evidence of viral pneumonia (viral cytopathic effect including All rights reserved.

A modification of the Cochrane Public Health Group Data Extraction and Assessment Template, 15 which was previously piloted by the researchers, was used to tabulate findings of the included articles. Finally, they independently assessed methodological quality of the studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool for case-series and case-reports. 16 Publication bias was considered high since all the included studies were either case-series or case-control in design. The quality of this review was validated with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) tool. 17",
