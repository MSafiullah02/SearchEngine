SA has one of the highest prevalence of tobacco product use in Africa5 and presently has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the continent, putting the country at risk of being hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic if nothing is done to curb the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable citizens.

There are also concerns about the implications on mental health when people are forced to give up their addictions during the lockdown10. It is understandable that tobacco and nicotine product users will be dealing with the mental stress of restricted movements in addition to giving up their addictions, but of more importance is that they become aware that the lockdown ban provides a good opportunity to quit tobacco use. In addition, resources to help tobacco users quit, or assist them to cope with withdrawals, should be made available and accessible. The National Council Against Smoking\u2019s quitline (011 720 3145), online materials (https://www.againstsmoking.co.za/) and the Cancer Association of South Africa\u2019s online quit tobacco program (https://www.ekickbutt.org.za/) are some good resources accessible to tobacco users to help them quit.",
