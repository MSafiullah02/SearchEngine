            "text": "The prospects of a new medicine making it from the laboratory bench to the pharmacy shelf are daunting. For each drug that makes it into the clinic for testing in humans, thousands do not, for myriad reasons ranging from easy-to-understand ones such as toxicity in animals to more esoteric ones such as \u201cdruggability\u201d (i.e., simply put, the likelihood of being able to modulate a target with a drug). Once in the clinic, the odds are a little better that a lead compound will emerge as the target product of a new drug application or biologics\u2019 license application and be approved by National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs)\u2014those odds are typically calculated to be about 1 in 10. Still this is not good news for drug sponsors, who may spend as long as two decades and over $1 billion USD out-of-pocket to get a new drug to market. But over the last decade, the news has become even more daunting. Risks associated with drug and biologics research and development (R&D) have only grown over time, while rewards are diminishing. Average time before follow-on competitors chase a first-in-class drug into the marketplace shrink each decade by several fold, and the percentage of prescriptions filled by generics doubles decade by decade (now reaching as high as 90% in many developed country markets). More telling for the demise of the traditional blockbuster strategy for achieving a sustainable return-on-interest (ROI) is that average sales for new launches were lower by 40% in 2010 from what they were just 5 years earlier [1] and declined to 2% from the 10% achieved in 2010 as of 2018 [2]. This new reality is often heralded as a healthy development for healthcare cost containment, even though drugs typically comprise a relatively minor share of the total bill for health care, for example, 10% in the USA [3]. However, for those concerned with not only controlling the escalation of healthcare costs but also curtailing health risks, these circumstances represent a different set of perils. Drugs that present too difficult a development challenge or too uncertain a market will not be able to compete successfully for resource allocation internally within companies or externally in the capital marketplace. These perils are particularly acute in new fields of product development like regenerative medicine or even a new sub-sector derived from several existing fields of product R&D\u2014such as Medical Counter Measures (MCMs), which are products that may be used in the event of a potential public health emergency stemming from a terrorist attack with chemical, biological, or radiological/nuclear (CBRN) agents or a naturally occurring, emerging or re-emerging infectious disease.",

Fully half of new active substances (NASs) approved globally each year, ownership of the extant R&D pipeline worldwide (for MCMs and in general), as well as the end-market for all medicines occur within the purview of the USA. So as the USA goes, so goes biopharma world. For example, historically most of the regulatory innovations of the twentieth century, such as the Orphan Drug and Fast Track programs, were first introduced in the USA and soon emulated by Europe and Japan, while in the twenty-first century, a number of emerging market countries (especially those in the Asia-Pacific region) base their regulatory and reimbursement evaluations on those conducted in the USA, especially for breakthrough products, for which the resources and expertise for developing the evidence base to make such decisions (e.g., regulatory science tools and/or real-world data) are limited in emerging market countries. In addition, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lead their respective fields of research and regulation due to the number and expertise of their staff, the size of their budgets, as well as global influence and interest.",

In addition, there are occasional infusions of updated commentary to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d of how we got to where we are today. These publications may be requested from Tufts CSDD (if originally published in-house) or through the usual channels for requesting articles published in the public domain (permission to reprint the articles having been granted, where required). The text of the chapter is structured basically in a chronological fashion beginning with Tufts CSDD analysis of the early era of MCM evolution as a sub-sector from various extant therapeutic areas. It then chronicles the changes to the R&D paradigm in response to the challenges that emerged for both MCMs and biopharma in general. Finally, it ends with an exploration of the devolution of the MCM sub-sector back into its roots in the infectious disease area as an increase in actual outbreaks as well as other signals of global vulnerability to pandemic threats have minimized the MCM emphasis on biodefense against a wide range of CBRN agents in favor of public health tactics to address humankind\u2019s maladaptation to a world in which it is constantly assailed by its microbial competitors and symbionts, or to novel public health crises of its own making.",

In aggregate, rare diseases comprise a large \u201cspecial patient\u201d population of 20\u201330 million each in the USA and European Union and perhaps as many as 400 million worldwide, but this population is spread over approximately 7000 small disease markets, and so became therapeutic \u201corphans\u201d due to the lack of incentives for product developers willing to foster R&D programs for these rare conditions. Close on the heels of the economic epiphany revealed by the orphaning of rare disease due to business reasons, the AIDS epidemic struck. In true epidemic fashion, AIDS quickly fomented a crisis for a healthcare system in the USA that had no weapons with which to stem the bewildering tide of morbidity and mortality, whereas cancer and HIV were rampant killers in the 1980s and 1990s, and budget thieves for healthcare systems as well; today scores of new medicines have blunted some of their public health impact and often have commuted imminent death sentences to chronic disability\u2014with variable levels of quality of life, but life nonetheless. Other diseases have now emerged to take their place; some, such as antibiotic-resistant infections, are as lethally inexorable as AIDS once was. Others, such as depression and obesity, kill more slowly but in great numbers across the spectrum of age ranges, just as cancer once did, unchecked and with little medical recourse. The difference over the years was that AIDS, rare diseases, and cancer developed a vocal and organized advocacy that affected political change, which in turn laid the statutory groundwork on which the USFDA built the designation programs to address the unmet medical needs of these special patient populations.",

            "text": "In the early 2000s, a frightening new public health reality dawned, as it became clear in the wake of 9/11 that terrorist attacks are a very real threat that could cause a large number of civilian casualties. Incidents involving anthrax, a commonly occurring bacterium, and sarin, a chemical toxin from a commonly used family of pesticides, demonstrated the potential for bioterrorists to use a wide range of CBRN agents in future attacks. Awareness of naturally occurring pandemics has also been increasing. The range of infectious threats include: emerging infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian flu (H5N1); re-emerging diseases like measles, pertussis, and Ebola; \u201cneglected diseases\u201d like tuberculosis, dengue, and water-borne parasites; and bioterror agents such as smallpox and anthrax. SARS was the first severe newly emergent infections of the twenty-first century and also demonstrated two significant characteristics of the new plagues: The first is their potential for significant direct (i.e., medical and government program costs) and indirect economic impacts (e.g., Asia-Pacific economy lost nearly $40 billion); and second, even relatively quick-kill infections can spread rapidly due to modern travel and the global nature of business (i.e., approximately 250 cases of SARS in 10 countries spread within a few days from a professor, who had been treating SARS patients in the Chinese countryside and then traveled to a popular hotel in Hong Kong).",

Many of the identified threats, even from pathogens known to be highly lethal and transmissible, did not have optimal or, even sometimes, any treatment options at all, beyond supportive care. At this time, however, the research and development of MCMs was typically viewed as \u201cstagnant or non-existent\u201d among major biopharma firms. As a consequence, what little R&D that took place was at small companies funded by venture capital with little institutional memory for managing a product from discovery through licensing to the marketplace. To this end, the US government (USG) passed a series of laws to stimulate countermeasure development that encompassed programs and funding for basic research, advanced development of technology, and acquisition of product for stockpiling in emergencies or prophylactic use by the military and first responders.",

Several years later, BioShield I was passed in order to create a market for MCMs by setting up a special reserve fund for the purchase of medical countermeasures to be stored in the strategic national stockpile (SNS) and available for quick distribution in the event of an attack. This was soon followed by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (also known as BioShield II), which brought both pandemic and bioterrorism legislation into one bill with the intent of generating incentives for entry into the business of biodefense. BioShield II established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the federal department of Health and Human Services (HHS). BARDA is the central authority in countermeasure development and administers the Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund, which expands the options for procurement funding to include milestone payments, awarding exclusive supplier status, establishment of domestic manufacturing capacity, and dosing and administration studies.",

Thus, although Big Pharma players in the MCM field were small in number, they were large on impact. However, even early in the evolution of the MCM sector, its fortunes as a whole appeared to be more likely to wax and wane in sync with the fortunes of the start-ups and SMEs based on their greater dependence on and resource commitment to MCMs. The paramount question that loomed in the background was whether MCMs would emerge as a new business sector under a traditional pharmaceutical business model or evolve into something similar to what was at the time still a shape-shifting biotech business model?\n",

This is a new market for know-how different from the one in which Big Pharma is the acknowledged leader, like cardiovascular or GI disease markets, where numerous drugs have been developed and an infrastructure is in place. Most government grants for civilian biodefense awarded to the private sector have gone to biotechs. This has engendered something akin to a working relationship between government and the biotech sector, albeit more like a mutual dependency. However imperfect, it is a better relationship and thus more valuable than what had previously existed between Big Pharma and governments. In addition, most biotechs in the biodefense field have specific platform technologies and research expertise that extends farther upstream in the R&D continuum than the clinical focus of most Big Pharma. This results in both information asymmetry and a disparity of tacit knowledge between biotech firms and Big Pharma (a potential competitor and/or buyer) on the one hand, and between biotech and government (a potential buyer) on the other.",

The MCM market is complicated by the influence of the government intervention in the market dynamics by supporting a market for know-how to a limited extent as well as being a source of capital for SMEs that adopt a vertical integration approach, but again to a limited extent. Since the market for know-how is limited to a cadre of SMEs (and start-ups that evolve into emerging SMEs) with a core focus on MCMs (mostly vaccines and technology platforms), this leaves room for other business models and sector players to address the remaining market needs. For fixed defenses, such as MCMs for some CBRN and known pandemic threats (e.g., antibiotics, antivirals, and treatments for acute radiation sickness (ARS) and chemical poisons), it would be Big Pharma, employing a FIPCO or NRDO model, using incremental innovation within their existing portfolios. For diagnostics, specialty pharma or biotechs are the likely players using FIPCO, or RIPCO involving partnering or out-licensing to Big Pharma/Biotech. For flu vaccines, it would be Big Pharma/Biotech and specialty pharma/biotech, perhaps in partnership. In addition, there is a significant role to be played by the government in both fixed and flexible defenses. For fixed defenses, the government\u2019s role would be as purchaser, and a lesser role as provider of R&D funding, and a limited role as the player of last resort in product development and manufacture. For flexible defenses, the government would have to play all three roles in order to generate an effective capacity.",

While it is unclear what exactly was expected in terms of somebody taking charge, start-ups and SME biotech companies were recognized as the most promising candidates to foster development of new medical countermeasures, and the USG began to focus its funding and assistance on these companies. They face serious challenges related to manufacturing capacity and negotiating the regulatory labyrinth, according to Battelle\u2019s Senior Market Manager for Medical and CBRN Products Russell Coleman. Examples of initiatives in place to address these challenges include: Advanced Development and Manufacturing capabilities (ADMc), which provides both development and manufacturing resources to smaller biotech companies as needed; and the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC), an organization that aims to help smaller companies who wish to work with the DoD navigate the process of becoming an approved federal contractor [5].",

Expediting development for unmet medical needs will require a change in philosophy, one that can be undertaken only with the help of patient advocates themselves, in line with the new appreciation for patient-focused (also called patient-centered) drug development. The threshold for acceptable risk\u2014the stumbling block for advancing HIV drugs decades ago\u2014must again be re-evaluated and tailored to the willingness of patients to enable developers to make drugs (and of the FDA to review them) that have a narrower margin between risks and benefits. To this end, FDASIA allows: patients to participate in \u201cappropriate agency meetings\u201d; conflict-of-interest caps to be removed to make eligible a broader swath of stakeholders, such as patient advocates and consumer representatives; and pilot programs for patient participation to be put in place at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research\u2019s divisions of oncology, gastroenterology, and antivirals; the Center for Devices and Radiological Health\u2019s offices dealing with in vitro diagnostics and cardiac devices; and selected units within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.",

A global industry survey was conducted across pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and contract research organizations, assessing 25 patient-centric activities within clinical research. Some of these initiatives involve the use of social media to engage with patients, or the use of social listening to monitor study activity. Twenty-two unique companies responded to the survey, representing a mix of large, mid-sized, and small organizations. The most widely adopted patient-centric initiatives, including activities both implemented and piloted across organizations, were patient advisory boards (17 companies), professional panels (16 companies), lay-language clinical trial results summaries (13 companies), assessment of the patient-organization landscape (10 companies), and the use of home nursing networks (9 companies). The results suggest that organizations have a varied approach to the adoption and implementation of patient-centric initiatives, with more activities occurring in the planning stages than are being piloted or implemented. Many factors affect implementation and adoption, including buy-in by senior management, organizational vision, resources, and level of investment [8].",

CSDD\u2019s most recent review (see Fig. 7.3) reveals that while some aspects of the field remain unchanged, there have been some significant changes as well. Broadly speaking, companies in the MCM field are typically privately owned, small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a biotechnology focus. While more than half of these companies are headquartered in the USA, there are now more non-US companies than in the past (48%).

It was established in 2004, with an initial budget of $5.6 billion through FY2013, and since 2006 has been managed by the Biomedical Advanced Research & Development Authority (BARDA), the overarching MCM authority within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. BARDA and Project BioShield budgets have grown steadily, with budget increases in 2016 totaling more than $400 mil USD over their 2015 budgets, signaling to biopharma companies that MCM development is of continuing interest to the US government (USG).

Frequent influenza outbreaks make this rapid and sustained growth within the pipeline unsurprising.

On the other hand, biodefense-only countermeasures tend to be purchased in bulk by governments and placed in readiness in something like the USG\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile. Ideally, such MCMs are rarely or never used, eventually reaching a target plateau in terms of \u201cmarket\u201d growth determined by the requirement to replace expired stock or expansion in the populations at-risk. Bacillus anthracis infection (Anthrax) illustrates this point very well. In 2008, there were 23 countermeasures being developed.

At that point, however, the imprimatur of the USFDA only goes so far to predict future success after launch. The path to commercial success can certainly be delayed by obstacles during the technical process of getting a product through the hurdles of proving safety, effectiveness, and product quality, but the last hurdle is always proving value\u2014to physicians, patients, and especially third-party payers, both private and public. A study by Tufts CSDD in the early 2000s showed that technical success and commercial success do not always go hand-in-hand. That seminal study reported that of 15 major companies, there was a wide range of correlations between technical and commercial success. That gap has only become more challenging over time. Even though the time of development has remained somewhat static over the last decade, the cost of development has doubled, and overall success rates have declined. Thus, the ramifications of a market failure are much more daunting than in the previous decade, when only 3 out of 10 marketed products earned enough to pay their own freight (and generally the sunk costs of the other products on the market as well).",

This is where payers have often been found wanting, either by requesting too much proof too early (i.e., pre-approval) or by an unwillingness to accept any risk at all for an untried product without regard to regulatory approval or patient need. As counterproductive as this seems, there are many examples of this being the case with urgent medical needs in orphan drugs, personalized medicines, and most recently, abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) for opioids. In a 2014 study by Tufts CSDD of orphan drugs approved from 1983 to 2013, 9 out of 10 drugs had at least one condition restricting reimbursement, whereas for the 11 most expensive orphan drugs, patient cost-sharing ranged from 20 to 35% for drugs costing on average $400,000 annually. For an early cohort of ten personalized medicines in 2013, Tufts CSDD found that payers reimbursed all drugs with variable and relatively high payer co-insurance and formulary restrictions, but reimbursement for the companion diagnostics was limited and highly variable. By 2015, product developers still considered reimbursement to be a 4 out of 5 on an index of the most challenging factors facing personalized medicine. The problem is not confined just to private insurers. For example, the opioid abuse epidemic in the USA sounded the clarion call for ADF products. There has been a laudable response by manufacturers with 25-30 new applications pending review, 10 approved, and 4 launched by mid-2017, despite the fact that two years earlier 96% of prescribed opioids were not ADF products. Nonetheless, coverage by the US government under the Medicare program ranges from only 8 to 54% for these four critically needed products.10\n",

We do want them to be able to make decisions on the best available evidence at the earliest point in time to meet an unmet need as soon as possible. This is where real-world evidence (RWE) comes into play. RWE is defined as data regarding the usage, or potential benefits or risks, of a drug derived from sources other than randomized controlled clinical trials, such as observational studies, registries, insurance claims databases, electronic medical records, wearable devices as well as patient-centered outcomes studies. The regulators are beginning to accept that RWE can be a telling source of evidence to assess the value over time in the life cycle of a marketed drug, and perhaps even answer questions that hadn\u2019t been asked yet, but should have been. However, there is some reticence to substitute RWE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the gold standard for providing the necessary quantum of proof for initial approval, although it is gaining credence as a supplement to pivotal RCTs in this regard. In fact, FDA\u2019s premier regulatory science experiment\u2014the Oncology Center of Excellence\u2014now just a year old, works to incorporate RWE among just a handful of key advances in regulatory decision-making along with revamping trial design to eliminate the arbitrary phases 1, 2, 3 structure, employing master protocols, re-defining trial eligibility criteria in conjunction with patient advocacy organizations to ensure representativeness, and reaching out to professional colleagues outside the agency as well as external stakeholders to generate better patient-reported outcomes metrics and instruments. Payers, for their part, have to shake off the shackles that bind them to a decision process that requires upfront proof of clinical superiority or rejection as the only two options for whether or not to reimburse a new drug (or a sliding scale of incremental cost-effectiveness that purports to implement a public health rationale of \u201cgreatest good for the greatest number of people\u201d but is really thinly disguised rationing). Real-world evidence in its simplest terms is evidence from the patient, by the patient, for the patient. If the system is serious about becoming more patent-centric\u2014as it should be since regulators serve the people, and patients are the end-customer for manufacturers and payers\u2014then the experience of the broadest swath of patients in the widest range of practice settings should inform payer decisions. Who will pay and how is a different question, and depends on individual, familial, community, and nation-state support as well as cultural norms, but the first threshold is to establish whether a product has sufficient value to bring this next set of considerations into play.",

However, the fact that neurological disease (including Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases) and cardiovascular diseases trail oncology by a considerable margin is a negative trend and brings into question the prioritization agenda of both the private and public sectors. During 2013\u20132017, oncology, diabetes, and orphan drugs comprised from 37 to 54% of the NAS launched worldwide, indicating that nearly half (46%) of all new drug approvals worldwide addressed a limited set of the most significant threats to global public health. For example, according to the WHO Global Burden of Disease study published in 2012, they recorded the following Global Death Ranks respectively in 1990 and 2010:\n",

Diabetes is beating the trend inveighing against the generalist market because it is widespread, well-covered, and cost-effective.

This generated a public health lobby from a consortium of 50 or so mostly public health and employer groups that successfully stumped for the GAIN Act with dramatic results. So, what changed over time from the twenty-oughts to the twenty-teens was a very real series of pandemic threats from Swine flu and Bird flu in 2009, H1N1, Ebola, antimicrobial resistance, etc., and a diminishing of bioterror concerns, which became subsumed into a background impetus for MCM prioritization. Coincident with this and in part because of it, MCMs devolved from an emerging stand-alone biodefense sub-sector to merge instead into the more generalized expansion of infectious diseases R&D for therapeutics, diagnostics, and preventatives.",

FRPs are better than nothing, but oncology has a competitive advantage in corporate decision-making for resource allotment because it benefits from decades of previous basic research that have created an expansive and expanding knowledge base on which to build future directions and reassess current ones. Diabetes on the other hand derives its favorable competitive position versus other therapeutic areas in the post-launch period because of the familiarity among providers and prescribers with the basics of the disease and a rising prevalence (fast approaching the certainty of death and taxes), as well as the pharma industry ROI \u201ccomfort level\u201d of addressing a long-term chronic disease affected by both metabolic and behavioral factors.",
