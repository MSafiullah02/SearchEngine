SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, single-stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) that spreads widely among humans and other mammals, causing a wide range of infections from common cold symptoms to fatal diseases, such as severe respiratory syndrome [2,3]. The worldwide mortality rate of this new virus appears to be around 3.4% (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#who-03-03-20), which is much lower than the 9.6% mortality rate of SARS-CoV-1 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#comparison). It should be considered that the majority of fatal cases are vulnerable populations with comorbidities such as immunosuppression, diabetes, or heart disease. The primary issue all over the world is the high human-to-human transmission that has led to the spread of its outbreaks in many countries [4]. ",

Therefore, the need to discover and develop drugs for the treatment of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgent. Remdesivir, an antiviral agent designed for the Ebola virus disease, was suggested to be a potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor by Liu et al., who also suggested three other possible inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 target enzymes [5]. Many research teams have exploited the major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, also named chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpr) [6], as a potential drug target to fight COVID-19. Sequence alignment revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares a 96% similarity to that of SARS-CoV-1 [7]. For example, Jiang and colleagues identified 30 drugs and compounds as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors through protein modeling and virtual screening [8], which represents rapid progress in the way of dealing with the crisis. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-1 Mpro structures are quite similar, the main difference being the surface of the proteins, where 12 different amino acids are located. Both enzymes consist of three domains; the domains I (residues 1\u2013101) and II (residues 102\u2013184) consist of an antiparallel \u03b2-barrel, and, for enzymatic activity, the \u03b1-helical domain III is required (residues 201\u2013301) [9,10,11].",

            "text": "Furthermore, both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-1 Mpro have a structure similar to that of the cysteine proteases, although the third catalytic residue is missing at their active site. Their active site includes a catalytic dyad, His41 and Cys145, and a particularly stable water molecule that forms at least three hydrogen-bonding interactions with the surrounding residues, including a catalytic histidine, which corresponds to the position of the third catalytic element [10,11]. It should also be noted that one of the different amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely Ser46, is located on the Cys44\u2013Pro52 loop that flanks the cavity of the active site. Another fundamental difference between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-1 Mpro is given by the different sizes and shapes of the external pockets found in the two systems. Surprisingly, the volume of the external pockets of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is, on average, half that of the SARS-CoV-1 Mpro. Thus, considering the similarity of the two structures, it can be assumed that there may be large differences between the accessibility to the binding cavity and/or the accommodation of the shape of the cavity in response to an inhibitor that can be bound. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-1 Mpro apo structure has shown the largest outer pocket respect to both ligand-bounded Mpro structures, suggesting that the SARS Mpro binding cavity is highly flexible and shows significant changes in both volume and shape after ligand binding [10,11].",

            "text": "These features can be exploited in the design of lead compounds with a potentially broad spectrum of activity. Generally, a suitable substrate can be converted to a good inhibitor by replacement of a part of the substrate sequence that binds directly to the active site of the protease, reversibly or irreversibly, with the chemical warhead targeting the catalytic mechanism. Peptide inhibitors were designed by attaching a chemical warhead (i.e., Michael acceptors, aldehydes, ketones, etc.) to a peptide that mimics the natural substrate [12]. These inhibitors act through a two-step procedure, wherein they first bind and form a non-covalent complex with the enzyme such that the warhead is preorganized near the catalytic residue. Subsequently, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the cysteine, leading to the formation of the covalent bond. Some peptidomimetic derivatives contain Michael acceptors as warheads and are an important class of cysteine protease inhibitors. The cysteine residue undergoes 1,4-addition to the inhibitor at the Michael acceptor warhead group, and the subsequent protonation of the \u03b1-carbanion results in the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme [12]. Our work aims to perform a virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro binding site using the library of Marine Natural Products (MNP). Many MNP have been detected as having various biological activities; peptides isolated from fish as well as algal polysaccharides have been reported to have anti-cancer, anticoagulant, and inhibitor activities. Marine bacteria and fish oils contain a considerable amount of omega-3 fatty acids, whereas seaweeds and shellfish, such as crustaceans, have potent antioxidants, including carotenoids and phenolic compounds [13]. On a pharmacophore model, built by Pharmit server (http://pharmitcsb.pitt.edu/) [14] starting from the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) and with the complexed ligand N3 (PRD_002214) structure employed as input, the virtual screening on the 164,952 conformers of the 14,064 molecules contained in the MNP library was carried out. Among these, 180 molecules were docked using AutoDock Vina software. Finally, we conducted a parallel docking study with AutoDock4 and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies, of 10 ns each, on the 17 molecules that showed the most promising results in terms of inhibitory activity.",

In this structure, the N3 peptide inhibitor is covalently bound with the Cys145 residue (Figure 1). Moreover, the surface topology of the active site inherent both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-1 Mpro proteins shows some differences, consisting in more sub-cavities and a smaller volume (337.2 A3 vs. 447.7 A3) for the first one (Figure 1). It should be noted that the volume of the crystallized ligand influences the volume of the catalytic pocket. Moreover, the high flexibility of the catalytic site plays an essential role in the volume of the Mpro pocket. Consequently, inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-1 Mpro might present altered binding affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.",

Points F2, F4, and F5 are aligned along with the peptide recognition site of the catalytic site with a distance of 6.30 \u00c5 between F2 and F4, while the hydrophobic pocket is located behind the triad at a distance of 6.93 \u00c5 with respect to F5 and 4.39 \u00c5 compared to F4. The hydrophobic cavity identified in F6 with a volume of 111.4 \u00c53 is capable of hosting phenyl residues as in the case of Pseudotheonamide D. The hydrophobic site in the HYD sub-pocket offered a good criterion for searching for ligands with hydrophobic residues with dimensions consistent with the pocket. An analysis of these ideal pharmacophore features enables the setting of threshold values for simple descriptors (bruisedness, distance to the cavity center, interaction energy) to reduce the number of pharmacophore features without losing crucial information.",

Heptafuhalol A (1) showed the lowest docking energy (\u221214.60 kcal/mol). As shown in Figure 4, the hydroxyl groups in heptafuhalol A form an extensive network of H-bonds within the protease receptor site. The acceptor residues of hydrogen bonds are represented by Thr24, Ser46, Asn142, Glu166, and Pro168. Furthermore, \u03c0-hydrogen bonds with His41 and Gly143 residues, and hydrophobic interactions with Met49, Met65, Leu141, and Pro168, further stabilize the ligand-receptor complex. The results from the MD simulation of the heptafuhalol A/SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex are shown in Figure S1. It is interesting to note that during the MD simulation the His41 residue, belonging to the catalytic dyad, establishes an H-bond with the hydroxyl residue of the ligand, with a distance of 1.97 \u00c5 and an average D\u2013H\u2013A angle of 177.8\u00b0 after 10 ns of simulation, with a free energy of \u221218.0 kcal/mol from re-docking.

These pseudotheonamides have been isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei and have shown good inhibitory activity on the serine protease [27]. Consequently, after having covalently linked the compounds 12 and 17 with the Cys145 residue, a short (2 ns) MD simulation was performed in order to stabilize the new complex. The lower energy system was further minimized, and covalent docking was performed. The binding energy of 12 and 17 is very similar (\u221214.9 kcal/mol and \u221214.4 kcal/mol, respectively) with a significant increase compared to the non-covalent interaction. The two compounds adopt a similar pose within the catalytic site, establishing H-bonds with the Asn142, Ser144, and Glu166 residues, while the benzyl groups settle into the hydrophobic pockets (Figure 6b,c). Peptidomimetic derivatives contain Michael acceptors as warheads are an essential class of cysteine protease inhibitors. In general, inhibitor design strategies involve the replacement of a substrate scissile amide bond with an appropriate Michael acceptor group. The cysteine residue undergoes 1,4-addition to the inhibitor at the Michael acceptor warhead group, and the subsequent protonation of the \u03b1-carbanion results in the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme [28,29,30].",

These compounds are also widespread on terrestrial plants and in food waste with good anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity [31,32,33,34,35]. Among these, Apigenin-7-O-neohesperidoside or Rhoifolin (whose structure belongs to flavone glycoside and its aglycone is apigenin, while the neohesperidose disaccharide constitutes the glycosidic structure) has the best binding energy (\u221212.39 kcal/mol). The docking pose of apigenin (Figure S8) shows H-bonds between the aromatic region and residues Leu141, Glu166, and Thr190, establishing a \u03c0-stacking interaction with Gln189. In SARS-CoV-1 Mpro it has been shown that the Gln189 mutation negatively affects inhibitory activity, suggesting that this area of the protein plays a key role in the binding interaction [36].",

The cutoff was 10 \u00c5 for Van der Waals forces (the default used by AMBER [50]) and no cutoff was applied to electrostatic forces (using the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm, [51]). The equations of motions were integrated with multiple time steps of 2.5 fs for bonded interactions and 5.0 fs for nonbonded interactions at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 atm (NPT ensemble) using algorithms described in detail previously [52,53]. The final system dimensions were approximately 80 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 80 \u00c53. Short MD simulation was run on the solvent only to remove clashes. The entire system was then energy minimized using first a steepest descent minimization to remove conformational stress, followed by a simulated annealing minimization until convergence (<0.01 kcal/mol \u00c5).
