The study aims to compare several parameters of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV infectious diseases in terms of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates. The publicly available dataset Worldometer (extracted on April 5, 2020) confirmed by WHO report was available for meta-analysis purposes using the Meta-MUMS tool. And, the reported outcomes of the analysis used a random-effects model to evaluate the event rate, and risk ratios thorough subgroup analysis forest plots. Seventeen countries for COVID-19 and eight countries of SARS infections, including COVID-19 group n 5 1124243, and SARS-CoV group n 5 8346, were analyzed. In this meta-analysis, a random effect model of relations of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates of COVID-19 and SARS world infections were determined. The meta-analysis and forest plots of two viral world infections showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 infection is more than SARS infections, while recovery and mortality event rates of SARS-CoV are more than COVID-19 infection. And subgroup analysis showed that the mortality and recovery rates were higher in both SARS-CoV wand COVID-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates, respectively. In conclusion, the meta-analysis approach on the abovementioned dataset revealed the epidemiological and statistical analyses for comparing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV outbreaks. \u00d3 2020 IMSS.

For this purpose, several authors have recently carried out their researches on COVID-19, which were mostly based on clinical and epidemiological views and included the potential symptoms, the ways of COVID-19 transmission, and epidemic issues (2) . Among them, Hellewell et al. proposed a stochastic transmission model that resulted in the case and contact isolations to control the COVID-19 outbreak (3) . Moreover, Peeri et al. compared the epidemics of three types of coronaviruses, namely SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. They concluded that there were no frequent outbreaks found from two previous ones, and the challenges for the COVID-19 should be covered by the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), which will be beneficial for control the incidence among people (4). Two systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies were available in the literature. They proposed five useful factors (i.e., clinical, laboratory, imaging features, procalcitonin measurements, outcomes of confirmed cases) in predicting the severity of the COVID-19 disease (5e7).",
