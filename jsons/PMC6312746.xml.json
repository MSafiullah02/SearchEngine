            "text": "Wild birds are ubiquitous, found on every continent, and a massive biomass of these animals moves across the globe on annual cycles of migration creating a truly interconnected planet (Bauer & Hoye, 2014). In addition to natural environments, birds can be found in our cities, using wastewater treatment plants, landfills and our drinking water reservoirs. Beyond wild birds, it is estimated that one out of every 7\u201314 birds on earth are raised for human consumption (i.e., chickens; Barrowclough, Cracraft, Klicka, & Zink, 2016; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2012), which may act as important amplifiers of potentially zoonotic avian viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV; Gao et al., 2013; Wan, 2012; Yoon et al., 2015). Despite our important relationship with birds, we have only a limited understanding of the diversity of avian viruses. Indeed, most studies of avian viruses have focused on those that cause mass mortality in wild birds (e.g., Wellfleet Bay virus; Allison et al., 2014; Ballard et al., 2017), result in substantial economic losses in food production birds (e.g., avian avulavirus type 1; Alexander, 2000; Leighton & Heckert, 2007; Tolf et al., 2013) or are zoonotic (e.g., IAV; Gao et al., 2013; Wan, 2012; Yoon et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Avian viruses have a rich and complex ecology (van Dijk, Verhagen, Wille, & Waldenstr\u00f6m, 2018), with patterns of prevalence affected by seasonality (Latorre\u2010Margalef et al., 2014), host species (Munster et al., 2007), host age (van Dijk et al., 2014), latitude (Lisovski, Hoye, & Klaassen, 2017) and urbanization (Wille, Lindqvist, Muradrasoli, Olsen, & Jarhult, 2017). However, although most studies of virus ecology and evolution have implicitly assumed a \u201cone\u2010host, one\u2010virus\u201d model of host\u2013pathogen interactions, such as the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)\u2013IAV model (van Dijk et al., 2014), both hosts and their viruses exist in communities, and it is likely that these communities are the drivers of viral ecology. For example, despite intensive focus on the Mallard\u2013IAV system (Latorre\u2010Margalef et al., 2014; van Dijk et al., 2014), IAV is in reality a multihost virus detected in over 100 species of wild birds, with different avian species playing different roles in virus ecology and evolution (Olsen et al., 2006). For example, gulls are reservoirs for evolutionary distinct IAV subtypes (Wille et al., 2011), and rare subtypes may be maintained in members of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes that are infrequently sampled (Wille et al., 2018). In turn, numerous viruses have been detected in wild bird populations, and Mallards may be co\u2010infected with at least three different RNA viruses simultaneously in the absence of overt signs of disease (Wille et al., 2015, 2017). These other avian RNA viruses\u2014avian coronavirus and avian avulavirus type 1\u2014have seasonal prevalence patterns that generally mirror that of IAV, and it is therefore possible that they may also share similar host taxonomic or geographic differences in viral community structure (Wille et al., 2017). Virus co\u2010infection may also be an important driver of viral prevalence, as virus\u2013virus interactions may enhance or interfere with infection (Diaz\u2010Munoz, 2017; Elena & Sanjuan, 2005; Henle, 1950; Jolly & Narayan, 1989). As a case in point, a higher prevalence of avian coronavirus was found in a bird population experiencing IAV infection, suggesting that the latter might play a role in structuring avian viromes in general (Wille et al., 2015).",

We used a recently developed unbiased meta\u2010transcriptomic pipeline based on bulk RNA\u2010sequencing (Shi, Zhang, & Holmes, 2018) to reveal the viromes of four Australian avian species and to evaluate how the structure of entire viral communities is impacted by a variety of ecological correlates. In particular, we assessed the role of host taxonomy, location and co\u2010infection with IAV on virome structure. This study illustrates the extent of RNA viral diversity in wild birds, and the importance of the expansion of traditional host\u2013pathogen systems beyond simple one\u2010host, one\u2010virus systems to disentangle ecological processes in viral presence and abundance.",

Viruses with full\u2010length genomes, or incomplete genomes but that possess the full\u2010length RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, were used for phylogenetic analysis. Briefly, amino acid sequences of the polyprotein or gene encoding for the RdRp were aligned using mafft (Katoh & Standley, 2013), and gaps and ambiguously aligned regions were stripped using trimAL (Capella\u2010Gutierrez, Silla\u2010Martinez, & Gabaldon, 2009). Final alignment lengths are presented in Supporting Information Table S2. The most appropriate amino acid substitution model was then determined for each data set, and maximum\u2010likelihood trees were estimated using PhyML 3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010) with 1000 bootstrap replicates using the ATGC server (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/execution.php). For IAV and gammacoronavirus, phylogenies were also estimated using the nucleotide sequences of complete or partial reference genome sequences to better place viruses in context of currently described avian viral diversity. Similarly, the best\u2010fit model of nucleotide substitution was selected, and maximum\u2010likelihood trees were estimated using PhyML 3.0 with 1,000 bootstrap replications. Novel viral species were identified as those that had <90% RdRp protein identity, or <80% genome identity to previously described viruses.",

This potentially suggests a preference for the Anseriformes, although this will need to be confirmed with more data (Figure 2a, Supporting Information Figure S9). In addition, rotaviruses were found in almost all libraries and in all host groups (Supporting Information Figure S9) with three different subtypes revealed (Figure 2b).

These viruses share 60% and 40% pairwise amino acid identity to avian nephritis virus, respectively, suggesting that there is a large undescribed diversity of wild bird avastroviruses. Calicivirus reads were identified in all libraries, with the exception of Anas ducks from the interior of Australia. Furthermore, full genomes of five caliciviruses were identified in four libraries at high abundance (Australian Shelducks 0.005% of total reads, Ruddy Turnstone IAV positive 0.006% of total reads, Anas duck IAV positive 0.002% of total reads and Avocet interior 0.03% of total reads), and all these viruses belonged to the same clade as currently described poultry viruses within an unassigned genus (Figure 4). Two novel rhabdoviruses from Anseriformes found in this study fell as a divergent group within the genus Tupaviruses, within which Durham virus is the only avian virus previously described (Figure 5). Specifically, Shelduck rhabdovirus and duck rhabdovirus fell as relatively distantly related sister species, as illustrated by long branch lengths on the phylogeny, and thereby potentially represent a novel clade of wild bird viruses.",

Because of the potential impact of host phylogeny, we expected that virome structure would be similar within the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes but differ between these orders. However, across all the libraries and controlling for location and IAV status, libraries from members of the Anseriformes were no more similar to each other than they were to those from the Charadriiformes. This lack of taxonomic distinction was apparent whether the analysis was performed at the level of viral species, genus or family (Figure 7, Supporting Information Figures S10\u2013S12, viral family, R\n2 = 0.142, p = 0.353; viral genus R\n2 = 0.153, p = 0.251), although the sample size was relatively small. To better control for other variables in our sampling scheme, we compared the libraries from avocets and dabbling ducks as these were all IAV negative and sampled from the same locations; in this case, the relationship remains statistically insignificant (viral family, R\n2 = 0.25, p = 0.4; viral genus R\n2 = 0.28, p = 0.3), although we lose statistical power due to the small sample size. Furthermore, the three libraries from Anas ducks had a different abundance and viral composition, and these three libraries represent differences in IAV infection status and location (Figure 7, Supporting Information Figures S10\u2013S12). No viral species were shared within host species or family, with the exception of IAV and a megrivirus found in both avocet libraries (Figure 7). Finally, there were no differences in viral family distribution at the level of host species and order; all viral families were found in both Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, with the exception of picobirnaviruses which only occurred in the Anseriformes (Supporting Information Figure S12).",

There was also a clear virome difference between Anas ducks across locations: a higher viral abundance and species diversity were found in the ducks from the interior compared to the temperate ducks that were negative for IAV. However, temperate ducks that were IAV positive had a higher viral diversity and abundance compared to ducks sampled from the interior (Figure 8a,b). Overall, incorporating all libraries and controlling for IAV infection status and host species, location did not predict higher similarity between the libraries, as libraries from the same location were no more similar to each other than those from different locations (viral family, R\n2 = 0.1, p = 0.554, viral genus R\n2 = 0.093, p = 0.8; Figures 7 and 8, Supporting Information Figures S10\u2013S12).

Based on previous studies, we anticipated finding low pathogenic forms of coronaviruses, astroviruses and avulaviruses (Wille et al., 2015, 2017). While we did detect most of these viruses, the absence of avian avulavirus was surprising. Avian avulavirus type 1 is present in wild birds in Australia (Hoque, Burgess, Greenhil, Hedlefs, & Skerratt, 2012; Hoque, Burgess, Karo\u2010Karo, Cheam, & Skerratt, 2012; Hore, Campbell, & Turner, 1973; Mackenzie, Edwards, Holmes, & Hinshaw, 1984; Peroulis & O'Riley, 2004) and globally (Alexander, 2000; Austin & Webster, 1993; Hanson et al., 2005; Ramey et al., 2013; Tolf et al., 2013; Wille et al., 2015), and has been detected in co\u2010infection studies (Wille et al., 2015, 2017). We also genomically described 18 new viral species which belonged to previously identified avian clades (genera) predominantly comprised of poultry viruses. For example, we identified five caliciviruses from wild birds that belonged to a previously described avian clade in the Caliciviridae comprised of chicken, turkey and goose caliciviruses (Liao, Wang, Wang, & Zhang, 2014; Wolf, Reetz, & Otto, 2011; Wolf et al., 2012).",

This raises two important issues. First, with the sequencing of more wild birds, those clades formally dominated by poultry will likely expand to include many viral species and genotypes from wild birds. This will be central to a better understanding the movement of avian viruses between wild bird reservoirs and poultry populations and hence of disease emergence in general. Indeed, poultry production has rapidly expanded in the last century (Kaleta & Rulke, 2008), to the extent that ~70% of avian biomass on the planet are now poultry (Bar\u2010On, Phillips, & Milo, 2018), creating a relatively new, but large niche for viruses. Furthermore, unlike wild birds, in viruses adapted to poultry such as Marek's disease virus (a double\u2010strand DNA virus), there has likely been selection for high transmissibility and high virulence (Rozins & Day, 2017). As such, sequencing wild bird viruses is imperative in understanding the evolutionary processes involved.",

            "text": "Second, these data raise the issue of how wild birds are able to tolerate such high levels of virus diversity and abundance seemingly in the absence of overt disease (Medzhitov, Schneider, & Soares, 2012; R\u00e5berg, 2014). In particular, cloacal swabs of Red\u2010necked Avocets from the interior had a high viral abundance (0.26% of reads were from avian viruses) and these 10 birds shed 13 viral genera and eight viral species for which full genomes were revealed. Ruddy Turnstone and Anas ducks that were infected with IAV similarly shed avian viruses at high abundance (0.21% and 0.1%, respectively), albeit with lower viral diversity. Although this must impose some physiological effect on the host, there continues to be conflicting data on the physiological effect of IAV infection in isolation (Kuiken, 2013), let alone the viral abundance described in this study. A large viral diversity in healthy, individual wild birds (Fawaz et al., 2016; Wille et al., 2015) and poultry (Day, Oakley, Seal, & Zsak, 2015; Day et al., 2010; Lima et al., 2017) has been previously described, in contrast to chickens in which viral diversity was described in diseased animals (e.g., diarrhoea; Boros et al., 2016). The leading hypothesis reflects a long history of host\u2013pathogen co\u2010evolution: chickens are a relatively new host niche for IAV, and following spillover from wild birds highly pathogenic phenotypes evolve (e.g., H7; Seekings et al., 2018), sometimes resulting in catastrophic mortality. This is in contrast to wild birds that have likely been co\u2010evolving with IAV over long time periods, with natural selection perhaps favouring lower virulence; as a consequence, the highly pathogenic IAV found in wild birds is most likely due to spillover from poultry (Barber, Aldridge, Webster, & Magor, 2008; Little, Shuker, Colegrave, Day, & Graham, 2010; van Dijk, Fouchier, Klaassen, & Matson, 2015). Indeed, a muted inflammatory response translating to immunological tolerance to viral infections may allow some hosts, such as bats, to harbour a variety of viruses (Brook & Dobson, 2015; Xie et al., 2018). Similarly, Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and wild strain Mallard ducks appear to have a controlled innate immune response against both low pathogenic IAV (Helin et al., 2018) and highly pathogenic IAV (Saito et al., 2018), with upregulation of the innate immune system occurring on day 1 postinfection and no evidence of hypercytokinaemia, or \u201ccytokine storms.\u201d Given the high (>0.1% of reads) viral abundance in some libraries, it is possible that some of the viruses described here do not cause disease in the absence of some other physiological or environmental stressor, although this is clearly an issue that needs to be explored in more detail.",

            "text": "Viral co\u2010infection is likely to be the rule rather than the exception and is shaped by both host ecology and virus\u2013virus interactions (Diaz\u2010Munoz, 2017). To date, much of what we know about viruses in wild birds is derived from many years of research in IAV (Ferenczi et al., 2016; Latorre\u2010Margalef et al., 2014; Munster et al., 2007; Olsen et al., 2006) and those RNA viruses that have similar patterns of host preference and seasonality (Wille et al., 2015, 2017). Members of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes have proven to be excellent model species for this study, and we detected viruses previously described in these hosts (Chu et al., 2011; Muradrasoli et al., 2010; Wille, Muradrasoli, Nilsson, & Jarhult, 2016; Wille et al., 2017) as well as a suite of novel viruses. One of the key observations of our study is that avian taxonomy did not drive virome structure; that is, there was no specific clustering of libraries in the NMDS plots by avian order (Anseriformes vs. Charadriiformes), and the three Anas duck libraries were different, although this analysis had limited statistical power. Given that IAV is prevalent in both these avian orders, we suggest that host ecology may play a more important role than host taxonomy in shaping virome diversity. For example, it is possible that waterbirds share viral families, genera and species as shallow water bodies facilitating virus transmission between individuals, as with IAV (Hoye, Fouchier, & Klaassen, 2012; van Dijk et al., 2018). In support of this, there was a difference between birds sampled (Red\u2010necked Avocets in particular) in lakes of the arid interior as compared to temperate coastlines.",

            "text": "The ecological factors assessed here are not mutually exclusive, as shown by the complex relationship between the three Anas duck libraries which had different structures given different conditions (location and IAV status). Samples from Ruddy Turnstones were collected from the same beaches on the same sampling trip, yet the 10 birds positive and negative for IAV had different viromes (total abundance, species abundances and viral diversity). Furthermore, the viromes of Anas ducks and Ruddy Turnstones that were positive for IAV were more similar to each other than to all other libraries. Anecdotally, while we were able to successfully culture H6N8 and H10N8 virus as part of an ongoing IAV surveillance project, the viruses from the Anas ducks were not successfully isolated, demonstrating the power of the meta\u2010transcriptomic approach used here. These trends, however, may be biased due to sample pooling, such that the patterns may be due to only a few individuals in the pool. Ultimately, therefore, the validity of the patterns observed here needs to be re\u2010assessed on the basis of individual transcriptomes, although such work will obviously be both costly and time\u2010consuming. In addition, it was previously shown (Wille et al., 2015) that co\u2010infection with IAV was important in modulating the prevalence of other RNA viruses. In particular, IAV modulates the interferon response of the host, changing the antiviral state (Garcia\u2010Sastre, 2001, 2011; Hale, Randall, Ortin, & Jackson, 2008), and this may promote co\u2010infection or prevent viral clearance of certain viruses. We have a surprisingly poor understanding of virus\u2013virus interactions, although viruses do have mechanisms to mediate infection by other viruses. For example, viruses may have synergistic (enhancing) or antagonistic (inhibiting) interactions, and this may occur within and/or across viral species (Diaz\u2010Munoz, 2017; Elena & Sanjuan, 2005; Henle, 1950; Jolly & Narayan, 1989). Regardless, virus\u2013virus interactions are important drivers of co\u2010infection and may be further affected by virus and host ecology (Diaz\u2010Munoz, 2017).",

This study focused on avian orders known to be central in the ecology of IAV, but also a number of other RNA viruses. Although this study is of a relatively limited scale from an ecological perspective, we have successfully described viral diversity in samples collected from different sites, times and avian species and found evidence for differences across these factors. Finally, we demonstrate several potential applications of viral community analyses and anticipate a rapid expansion of viral ecology to move beyond the one\u2010host, one\u2010virus system and to consider both viruses and hosts as complex ecological communities.",
