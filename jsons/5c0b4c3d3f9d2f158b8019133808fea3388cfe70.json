            "text": "Background: The Study of Healthcare Personnel with Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses in Israel (SHIRI) prospectively follows a cohort of healthcare personnel (HCP) in two hospitals in Israel. SHIRI will describe the frequency of influenza virus infections among HCP, identify predictors of vaccine acceptance, examine how repeated influenza vaccination may modify immunogenicity, and evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza illness and missed work. Methods: Cohort enrollment began in October, 2016; a second year of the study and a second wave of cohort enrollment began in June 2017. The study will run for at least 3 years and will follow approximately 2000 HCP (who are both employees and members of Clalit Health Services [CHS]) with routine direct patient contact. Eligible HCP are recruited using a stratified sampling strategy. After informed consent, participants complete a brief enrollment survey with questions about occupational responsibilities and knowledge, attitudes, and practices about influenza vaccines. Blood samples are collected at enrollment and at the end of influenza season; HCP who choose to be vaccinated contribute additional blood one month after vaccination. During the influenza season, participants receive twice-weekly short message service (SMS) messages asking them if they have acute respiratory illness or febrile illness (ARFI) symptoms. Ill participants receive follow-up SMS messages to confirm illness symptoms and duration and are asked to self-collect a nasal swab. Information on socio-economic characteristics, current and past medical conditions, medical care utilization and vaccination history is extracted from the CHS database. Information about missed work due to illness is obtained by self-report and from employee records. Respiratory specimens from self-collected nasal swabs are tested for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses using validated multiplex quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. The hemagglutination inhibition assay will be used to detect the presence of neutralizing influenza antibodies in serum. Discussion: SHIRI will expand our knowledge of the burden of respiratory viral infections among HCP and the effectiveness of current and repeated annual influenza vaccination in preventing influenza illness, medical utilization, and missed workdays among HCP who are in direct contact with patients.",

            "text": "Healthcare personnel (HCP) are believed to be at increased risk of respiratory viral infections, with one in five estimated to be infected with seasonal influenza each year [1] . These estimates vary widely, however, depending on the extent of active surveillance and the use of serologic vs. molecular diagnostics. Respiratory infections are of particular concern among HCP because of the close contact of HCP with patients [2] , and the risk of HCP transmitting respiratory viruses to others [3] . Although recent research suggests that certain subgroups of HCP, such as those who perform aerosol-generating procedures, may be at heightened risk of infection with influenza and other respiratory pathogens [4] , incidence of infections among HCP is not well characterized across different occupations and responsibilities. Furthermore, although HCP often work while ill [5] [6] [7] , the extent to which infected HCP transmit respiratory pathogens to patients is not clear [8] . Further research is needed on the frequency and types of interactions HCP have with patients when they have symptomatic, atypical, or asymptomatic [1, 9] influenza virus infections.",

However, much less is known about the barriers to vaccine acceptance among HCP in countries in the Middle East [12] . In Israel, a high-income country, less than half (49%) of HCP received influenza vaccine for the 2015-2016 influenza season; vaccine coverage was somewhat higher among hospital-based physicians (53%) than nurses (46%) [17] . More information is needed on the occupational, socio-demographic, and KAP factors that may explain variations in influenza vaccine acceptance in Israel, including how the personal KAP of HCP may impact on their promotion of influenza vaccination among their patients.",

These eligibility criteria are similar to previous studies of HCP with direct patient contact [24, 30] .

All participants must also be members of CHS and have had continuous membership in CHS for at least 1 year prior to enrollment (in order to access medical and vaccination records). HCP are invited to join the study whether or not they intend to be vaccinated. HCP are excluded if they received the current season's flu vaccine more than 48 h before enrollment. If enrollment goals are not met, some enrollment restrictions can be eliminated (e.g., requiring prior year membership in the Clalit health plan, working, \u226530 h per week, or plans to stay at the facility for at least 2 years) and differences in outcomes by these characteristics can be examined analytically. Eligibility is determined by reviewing CHS's electronic medical record (EMR), which contains information on all of the eligibility criteria listed above except for the number of working hours, which is determined in the recruitment phone call.

HI to inactivated influenza vaccine components and influenza circulating strains will be performed at a reference laboratory using standard methods [33] as described previously [28, 34] (See Additional file 1: Annex 4). Egg-grown viruses will be supplied by the US CDC's International Reagent Resource. Preparation of serum samples will include (a) treatment with a receptor-destroying enzyme to remove nonspecific inhibitors, and (b) removal of nonspecific agglutinins by serum adsorption with packed red blood cells (RBC). Standard 0.5% turkey RBC will be prepared for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 antigens and ether-treated B influenza antigens. Given indications that neuraminidase of circulating antigenic clusters of influenza A(H3N2) viruses (since 2014) have acquired the ability to bind to RBC, modified HI assays will be conducted for influenza A(H3N2) antigens using guinea pig red blood cells in the presence of the antiviral oseltamivir carboxylate, which inhibits influenza neuraminidase. Serum will be diluted 2-fold starting from 1:10. The HI titer will be the reciprocal of the serum dilution in the last well with complete HI. The geometric mean titer from duplicate results will be reported; HI < 10 will be considered 5 for the purposes of statistical analyses.",

Another strength is that the two study sites (Soroka University Medical Center and Beilinson Hospital) are among the largest hospitals in Israel, and the populations they serve and the HCP they employ vary in socio-demographic and economic characteristics. Soroka University Medical Center, the only general hospital in the Negev region in southern Israel, serves two main local populations: Jews, who mostly live in urban settings, and Bedouin Arabs, who live in a range of settlement types, from cities to unrecognized rural villages that lack electricity and running water [42, 43] . Beilinson Hospital, located in central Israel, serves a mostly urban population of a relatively higher socio-economic status compared to Soroka University Medical Center. Conducting our study in these two different settings may allow us to identify socio-demographic differences in KAP, vaccine uptake, and influenza illness attack rates. The use of mixed methods, including laboratory, clinical and epidemiological quantitative data, and in-depth qualitative interviews, creates a comprehensive approach, which is particularly important when trying to understand issues of influenza vaccine compliance and hesitancy.
