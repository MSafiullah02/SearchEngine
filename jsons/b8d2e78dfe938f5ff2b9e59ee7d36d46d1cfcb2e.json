In this work, we propose two extensions for these filters when there exist multiple frames of the same scene. To this end, we combine two novel inter-frame connectivity strategies with robust optical flow methods. Our extensions do not require additional parameters and outperform existing techniques qualitatively by a significant margin. By exploiting spatial and temporal separability, one of our approaches is also faster than its competitors. Since our strategy is not restricted to BM3D and NLB, it can be generalised to other similar singleframe patch-based methods.",

The first strategy exploits the advantage of having an extra degree of freedom by employing a separable spatio-temporal similarity-based grouping on a single reference frame [26] - [30] . The other strategy makes use of the complete available information in all frames by employing combined spatio-temporal approaches [31] , [32] . We abbreviate these extensions as SF (single reference frame filtering) and CF (combined filtering), respectively. However, methods which combine the advantages of both these strategies and those which seperately filter information in the spatial and temporal dimensions, have not been studied. A careful and systematic evaluation of these techniques is also missing. Our contribution. In order to address the above problem, in our recent conference paper [43] we introduced two types of extensions: Firstly, we combined the advantages of both the above existing extensions into a single method, by employing a separable similarity measure on every frame. We abbreviate this extension as MF (multiple reference frame filtering). Secondly, we introduced two other extensions which utilise the advantage of separately filtering the different types of data in the temporal and the spatial dimensions. In the first strategy FA (filter-average), we performed the spatial filtering before the temporal averaging, while in AF (average-filter) we reversed this order. A comparative analysis of the above four extensions (we did not consider CF in our conference paper) when applied to BM3D, revealed that our proposed extension MF gives the best results for perfectly registered data.",

In the multi-frame scenario, there exists slightly different type of data in the temporal and spatial dimensions. Thus, in order to combine them carefully the first two extensions break down spatio-temporal filtering into two stages. Proposed Extension -AF [43] : First, we average all the frames registered using optical flow. Then we employ a single-frame filter for removing the remaining noise in the averaged frame. Proposed Extension -FA [43] : Here, we first denoise every frame by using a single-frame filter and then average the denoised and registered frames.

We then choose the best method to register every dataset. For Shoe and Bird House datasets we have optimised the SOF-3 parameters with respect to the final denoised image directly as the ground truth flow was not available. Table IV shows more details. Denoising Parameters: Various studies [18] , [19] , [21] , [22] , [52] have contributed in making the single-frame filters BM3D and NLB parameter selection-free, while retaining the quality of the denoised images as much as possible. In a similar spirit to the above works, in this paper we use better versions of two extensions introduced in our conference paper [43] . 1 http://sipi.usc.edu/database/ Firstly, at the time of application of the filter in the first extension AF, the noise distribution has already changed due to temporal averaging. Since we are using an AWGN model, we know that the standard deviation of noise is reduced by \u221a L times for a dataset with L frames. We can improve the performance of type-AF extensions if we select the filter parameters corresponding to the new standard deviation. The second improvement is to optimise the number of patches in a 3D group for high amplitude noise elimination using both the original single-frame BM3D filter as well as the BM3D-MF technique. We mentioned in [43] that various extensions of BM3D give better results if we remove the threshold parameters on the L 2 distance during the grouping stage. Here, we show the visual and statistic difference in quality with such a change for both single-frame BM3D and BM3D-MF techniques (Table I and Figures 1 -2) . It is clear that having more patches by removing the thresholds minimises the artifacts in the homogeneous regions and the black square shaped patches in the darker regions of the image are also eliminated. Moreover, in the multi-frame scenario we have more similar patches, when compared to the single-frame layout. We thus check in the upcoming sections, whether an optimised version (BM3D-MFO) of the best performing extension (BM3D-MF) in our conference publication [43] , can give even better results by further increasing the number of patches in a 3D group through doubling. (AL2E) . Left, Centre-left, Centre: Grove2 dataset with SOF-1, SOF-2 and SOF-3 methods, respectively. We have considered the tenth frame as the reference frame since ground truth flow information was available between frames 10 and 11. Centre-Right: Shoe dataset with SOF-3 method. Right: Bird House dataset with SOF-3 method. We have utilised the fifth frame as the reference frame for both these datasets and then employed frames 4-6 for optimising the optical flow parameters. Also, we have used BM3D-MF and BM3D-FA as denoising methods for optimising SOF parameters for these two datasets, respectively. For the denoised results of perfectly registered noisy data using SF and CF extensions, we have always presented the best MSE value among all frames. For experiments on nonregistered datasets, we have calculated the MSE value by leaving out a border of fifty pixels on all sides of the reference frame at which different frames were registered. We do this in order to mitigate the ill-effects due to unavailable information at the borders of registered images. This also makes sense in multi-frame imaging because we capture the region of interest in the centre of the frame. Table II showcases the MSE values of the denoised images and Figure 3 displays the visual results, after we have applied all ten methods. It is clear from these results that extensions of type-AF outperform all other techniques. They are superior to type-MF methods (which is in contradiction to our conference paper) as we account for the change in the noise distribution due to temporal averaging.",

This is advantageous since we have noisy versions of the same original greyvalue in the temporal dimension for perfectly registered images. In the spatial dimensions we have noisy versions of approximately equal grey values in general. This outperforms simultaneous non-linear filtering of the final two types of techniques, where we combine the information in all dimensions at one go. Such a strategy proves to be inferior even though we use a nonlinear filtering in the temporal dimension when compared to the linear temporal averaging of category-AF filters. This is because linear averaging of different noisy versions of the same pixel intensity does not create artifacts like combination with dissimilar pixel intensities does. This is in congruence with why averaging is preferred in electron microscopy (Chapter 11 of [53] ). Moreover, the linear averaging helps in computing the new standard deviation of noise after temporal averaging through theoretical knowledge. Secondly, BM3D-AF and NLB-AF compute the grouping on the less noisy averaged image. In all the other four categories we do this on the highly noisy initial images, which makes the grouping error-prone.",

We must remember that we assumed AWGN noise and perfect registration. In the first scenario, we were able to optimise the denoising ability of NLB-AF and BM3D-AF easily for AWGN. This is because of its signal independent nature, which helped in proper selection of filtering parameters through theorectical knowledge of the change in noise distribution due to temporal averaging. For noise of Poissonian type for example, AWGN elimination methods are normally combined with variance stabilising tranformations (VST) for noise elimination. This combination with VSTs and noise of signal dependent nature makes it difficult to optimise for the change in noise distribution. In another recent paper [54] , we evaluated the first four BM3D extensions in the Poissonian noise scenario and observed similar results as for our Gaussian noise study [43] : BM3D-MF outperformed BM3D-AF. This is because we cannot straightforwardly compute the new standard deviation of noise after temporal averaging in the Poissonian noise scenario. We speculate that employing a more sophisticated VST framework (see eg. [55] , [56] ) could help in accounting for the imprecision in variable stabilisation for all extensions. Furthermore, it might help in dealing with the additional imprecision caused due to change in the noise distribution in AF techniques. The second scenario where we cannot reject methods from categories other than type-AF is for imperfect registrations. We will examine this situation in the upcoming section where we consider non-registered datasets.",

Thus, the net complexity is just a combination of the optical flow method and the 2D single-frame filter employed on the temporally averaged frame. To elaborate further, let us consider BM3D-MF which is the next best extension after the first category techniques. Our experimental demonstrations on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @3.4 GHz using C++ and OpenMP, were eleven times slower for BM3D-MF when compared to the original single channel BM3D (5-frame 256 \u00d7 256 sized House dataset). This factor is slightly more than twice the number of frames that we used. It can be attributed to considering every frame as the reference frame instead of just one as well as to the extensive patch-search across all frames. We also have a GPU implementation of BM3D-MF using ANSI C and CUDA which takes 2.7 seconds on an NVIDIA Quadro P5000 architecture. This was about 6.5 times faster than the parallel CPU implementation. We have already shown that BM3D-MF encompasses BM3D-OF mathematically. Thus, the same GPU implementation can also be employed for BM3D-OF by just changing the number of frames to one and using the new standard deviation of noise after temporal averaging, as input.",

This is true for both NLB and BM3D, an observation which has surprisingly not been recognised for many years. This re-affirms the fact that sometimes the simpler methods are the most powerful ones. Furthermore, the significant quality improvement comes with zero additional parameters and less computational costs. The technique preserves a large amount of detail even when the images are corrupted with noise of very high amplitude.
