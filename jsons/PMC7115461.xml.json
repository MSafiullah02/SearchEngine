All regions, excepting Africa (+3%) and South America (+0.2%) seeing declines in tourism demand. By October, the UNWTO\u2019s panel of experts was predicting that after fuel costs, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and uncertain currency exchanges rates would have secondary negative impacts on long-haul travel in 2010 (UNWTO, 2009b, p. 6). Then, in January 2010, 2009 H1N1 was classified as a downside risk with less overall impact than expected but which could emerge as a threat to international tourism recovery and growth (UNWTO, 2010, p. 7). Looking back at international tourism arrivals in 2009, which were estimated as declining by 4%, the economic crisis, currency variations, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were all factors depressing outbound travel. With the pandemic impacting markets in Northeast Asia and the Americas particularly (UNWTO, 2010, p. 14), the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was a significant negative factor in an \u201cexceptionally challenging\u201d year for international tourism.",

Understanding their behavior would help government agencies, tourism marketers, transport systems, and hospitality services cope with a crisis more effectively. This study classified the perceived risk for 2009 H1N1, a novel influenza virus that emerged in Mexico, as an obstacle which could discourage tourists from visiting other countries. For instance, if tourists who are planning international travel perceive risks from 2009 H1N1, such as suffering illness while abroad, they could postpone or cancel their plans (Reisinger & Mavondo, 2005). We theorized that in a pandemic, potential tourists would consider voluntary personal non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) which could decrease their risk of 2009 H1N1 infection while traveling. Tourists may choose NPI because of the delay in the production of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, or because of limited vaccine availability in their country (Chaturvedi, 2009). Personal NPI include getting better knowledge of the disease and pandemic; improving personal hygiene practices while traveling; using social distancing to avoid suspect people or places; and monitoring personal health before and after the trip (Nicholl, 2006).",

The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) are frequently used in previous studies for understanding travelers\u2019 intentions or behavior. However, these theories have limitations. They do not contain the influence of past behavior which may affect intention and behavior (Leone, Perugini, & Ercolani, 1999) and they focus on the cognitive variables without considering affective variables associated with behavior (Conner & Armitage, 1998). So, the present study employed the model of goal-directed behavior (MGB), which considers motivational process, affective process, and past behavior, to better predict potential travelers\u2019 decision-making processes. According to Perugini and Bagozzi (2001) theory broadening and deepening of this theory is necessary for improving predictions of human behavior in differing contexts. Hence, this research extended the MGB by including perceptions and NPI for 2009 H1N1 that were meaningful in explaining human behavior better.",

The study had four aims. First, examining potential travelers\u2019 decision-making processes when the risk of 2009 H1N1 infection discourages traveling abroad, by developing an extended model of goal-directed behavior (EMGB) explaining international travel intent that includes perceptions of 2009 H1N1 and NPI in the MGB framework. Second, verifying the superior predictive ability of the EMGB compared with the TRA and TPB. Three, examining the perceptions of the 2009 H1N1 virus and the NPI for the virus among a sample of Korean potential overseas travelers and the role of these perceptions in a proposed theoretical framework. Four, providing government agencies, tourism marketers, transport systems, and hospitality services with practical suggestions for NPI which could mitigate pandemics and benefit the public and tourism businesses.",

During March 2009, an unfamiliar influenza-like illness appeared in the Mexico (World Health Organization [WHO], 2009a). In April under international health protocols the Mexican government reported this to the Pan-American Health Organization as an outbreak of a novel influenza type virus (Neumann et al., 2009, World Health Organization, 2009a). Then, the United States Centers for Disease Control identified the virus as a new strain of Influenza A H1N1 (Jeeninga, de Jong, & Berkhout, 2009) now known as 2009 H1N1. Within six months, as the number of people infected by 2009 H1N1 rapidly increased globally, the WHO quickly increased the pandemic alert for 2009 H1N1 to the high phase six level (WHO, 2009b).",

Appearing in a mild form causing flu-like symptoms of coughs and high fever for three days with mild mortality, then, reappearing within six months as a deadly mutation with a high mortality level it spread around the world killing millions rapidly.

Pharmaceutical choices include using antiviral drugs and fabricating new vaccines. Several groups of antiviral drugs are useful during an influenza pandemic\u2019s early stage. However, drug resistance limits the efficacy of the cheaper and more obtainable group of M2 inhibitors, whereas difficulties of distribution, dosage, and supply limit the usefulness of the more expensive group of neuraminidase inhibitors. Also, three parameters govern the benefits of pandemic influenza vaccines: the four to six months to fabricate a new vaccine, the possibility of several doses being needed, and limited production capacity (Finkelstein, Prakash, Nigmatulina, Klaiman, & Larson, 2009, p. 6; Oshitani, 2006, p. 168). With these constraints on the efficacy and availability of pharmaceutical interventions during an influenza pandemic\u2019s early stage, NPI are essential for slowing the outbreak (Aledort, Lurie, Wasserman, & Bozzette, 2007).",

Social distancing by closing schools, calling off public events, reducing access to public transport, and working from home during an outbreak diminishes the chance for person-to-person infection. Hygiene action by washing hands, wearing masks, and techniques for containing coughing and sneezing restrict disease transmission (Finkelstein et al., 2009). During the SARS outbreak, the administrative NPI of contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were important in restricting the spread of the virus (Omi, 2006).

More generally, if a country received more than 1400 air passenger arrivals from Mexico the risk of H1N1 importation increased markedly (Khan et al., 2009). During the 2009 Southern Hemisphere winter, however, fear of the disease probably caused short-term and or localized social and economic effects and a temporary decline in tourism in Australia, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Uruguay (Department of Health and Human Services, 2009, p. 9). The five countries each used community mitigation measures in response to the disease including using antiviral drugs and NPI measures.",

Some flights were canceled between Argentina and Mexico; questionnaires and information pamphlets were used at the U.S. and Mexico border; and New Zealand screened passengers from countries of concern (Department of Health and Human Services, 2009, p. 7). The 2009 H1N1 outbreak illustrates the complexity of implementing NPI administrative controls on a global basis. For example, 2.35 million air tourists from Mexico arrived in 1018 cities in 164 countries during March and April 2008, with a similar pattern estimated during the same months in 2009 when the novel 2009 H1N1 virus emerged (Khan et al., 2009).",

First, the disease incubation period is longer than the typical journey period. Second, passengers who experience symptoms may not admit their condition for fear of disrupting their travel arrangements. Third, fast reliable screening and diagnostic techniques for infectious diseases among airline passengers while they are in the airline network are not commonly available. Therefore, passive controls at national borders have limited effectiveness at halting the arrival or departure of an influenza-like infectious disease and the near symmetry between international airport-pairs means shared risk of export and import of ill passengers. Besides, to impede an outbreak by several weeks or more would need a 99% effectiveness of border controls and internal travel checks (Ferguson et al., 2006).",

The complexity of rapid international air transport; the efficacy and availability of antiviral drugs and vaccines; and the difficulty of NPI like border controls, mean that stopping a pandemic is an evolving global challenge. A pandemic affects tourism-related industries negatively because potential tourists experience increases in perceived risk and anxiety due to inadequate information about the origins, prevention, and treatments for the disease (Wu, Law, & Jiang, 2010). So, when a pandemic alert is active the intentions of tourists to travel internationally, their perception of the disease, and personal protective NPI measures for the disease need further investigation.",

To improve the usefulness of the TRA and TPB, Perugini and Bagozzi (2001) proposed the model of MGB which includes all original variables in the TPB but redefines their role as indirectly affecting behavioral intention through desire. They also claimed that motivational, affective, and habitual processes should be included in the social psychological model in order to better comprehend human behavior. In terms of motivational process, desire was suggested as a critical factor in explaining decision formation (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001). With regard to affective process, anticipated affective reactions to a specific behavior were recommended as an imperative variable in decision-making processes (Conner & Armitage, 1998). In terms of habitual process, past behavior was suggested as a significant determinant of human decisions (Aarts et al., 1998, Bentler and Speckart, 1981, Ouellette and Wood, 1998). So, to better understand specific human behavior the MGB incorporates desire, positive and negative anticipated emotions, and past behaviors as well as the original variables of the TPB.

The TPB asserts that attitude toward a behavior strengthens a person\u2019s intention to perform it, however, the MGB redefines attitude as affecting intention indirectly through desire. So, attitude toward a behavior in the MGB affects intention indirectly through desire (Leone et al., 2004, Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001, Prestwich et al., 2008). As salient referents influence personal decision-making and behavior (Bearden and Etzel, 1982, Cheng et al., 2006) a person considers complying with other people\u2019s opinions when determining if they should undertake a behavior. This subjective norm is the perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior (Ajzen, 1991). In the MGB this would not directly fortify a person\u2019s behavioral intention but effects behavioral intention indirectly through desire (Leone et al., 2004, Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001, Prestwich et al., 2008).",

Past behavior is regarded as a proxy of habit, implying that it influences desire and intention (Bagozzi and Warshaw, 1992, Bentler and Speckart, 1981, Fredricks and Dossett, 1983). In the MGB, it was theorized that past behavior influenced desire, intention, and actual behavior (Conner and Armitage, 1998, Ouellette and Wood, 1998). The final dependent variable in this study was behavioral intention, not actual behavior.

These include gaining better knowledge about the disease and the pandemic, actions for improving their personal hygiene while traveling, and decreasing infection possibilities by social distancing from suspect people and places. The study posited that perceptions of 2009 H1N1 have a direct or indirect effect on tourists\u2019 desire and intention to travel through NPI to avoid H1N1 infection as follows. H10 \u2013 perception of 2009 H1N1 has a negative influence on desire; H11 \u2013 perception of 2009 H1N1 has a positive effect on non-pharmaceutical interventions; H12 \u2013 perception of 2009 H1N1 has a negative effect on intention; and H13 \u2013 non-pharmaceutical interventions have a positive effect on intention.",

The subjective norm to travel internationally was operationalized with four items (see Appendix) as suggested by previous research (Ajzen, 1991, Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001, Oh and Hsu, 2001). The perceived behavioral control was operationalized with four items (Appendix) as suggested by previous research (Ajzen, 1991, Lam and Hsu, 2006). The perception of Influenza A (H1N1) was operationalized with four items (Appendix) as suggested by previous research (Reisinger and Mavondo, 2005, Sonmez and Graefe, 1998). The non-pharmaceutical interventions for Influenza A (H1N1) were operationalized with seven items. These items were derived from the codes and precautions of UNWTO, WHO, and MIHWFA to prevent from catching Influenza A (H1N1) (Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs, 2009a, Ministry for Health, 2009b, UNWTO, 2009c, World Health Organization, 2009c). Three of these items included actions to improve knowledge of the disease (Appendix). Three items included actions about personal hygiene and health. And one item included action on social distancing. Desire was operationalized with four items (Appendix) as suggested by previous research (Carrus et al., 2008, Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001). Positive (4 items) and negative (4 items) anticipated emotions (Appendix) were operationalized with eight items as suggested by previous research (Carrus et al., 2008, Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001, Prestwich et al., 2008). The variables of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, perception of Influenza, and NPI were rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). However, positive and negative emotions were rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from not at all (1) to very much (7).

Collected data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (2001) and EQS \u2013Structural Equation Modeling Software (Bentler & Wu, 1995). As a first step in the evaluation of the measurement model, exploratory factor analysis identified the structure of factors and systematically measured variables in underlying constructs. This lessened multicollinearity or error variance correlations among indicators (Bollen, 1989, Yoon and Uysal, 2005). The structural equation modeling used a two-step hybrid method by specifying a measurement model in the confirmatory factor analysis and testing a latent structural model developed from the measurement model (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988, Hatcher, 1994, Kline, 2005).",

All factor loadings were greater than the minimum criterion of 0.5, with significant associated t-values and all average variance extracted and composite reliability values for the multi-item scales exceeding the minimum criterion of 0.7 and 0.5 respectively (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006).

These findings were consistent with previous research in other settings (Ajzen and Madden, 1986, Chang, 1998) and imply that including perceived behavioral control did play a significant role in predicting behavioral intention.

The MGB better accounted for the variance in explaining behavioral intention. This model was superior to the TRA model for explanatory power (EMGB = 0.793 vs. TRA = 0.534, \u0394\u03c7\n2 (711) = 1008.41, p < 0.001). Consistent with other research (Bagozzi and Dholakia, 2006, Carrus et al., 2008, Prestwich et al., 2008, Prestwich et al., 2008, Taylor et al., 2005) the results showed the EMGB with desire, positive anticipated emotion, negative anticipated emotion, and frequency of past behavior performs better than the TRA and TPB models. Enhancing our understanding of the decision process of behavioral intention these results prompt several suggestions. The TPB is inadequate for explaining behavioral intention to travel internationally, and the processes behind the effect of the predictors are more intricate than assumed in the TPB (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001).",

In specific, this approach included the perception of 2009 H1N1 and the personal NPI for 2009 H1N1. The EMGB incorporated the construct of desire as a mediator which considered volitional factors (attitude and subjective norm), non-volitional factors (perceived behavioral control, the perception of 2009 H1N1, and the NPI for 2009 H1N1), emotional factors (positive anticipated emotion and negative anticipated emotion), and the frequency of past behavior.

Demonstrating, in this context, that theory broadening and deepening as described by Perugini and Bagozzi (2001) is reasonable by integrating new constructs or by altering the paths to be more appropriate in the model. So, the revised model explains a substantial proportion of the total variance of the dependent variable of intention in this study. Also, consistent with previous studies of MGB (e.g., Bagozzi and Dholakia, 2006, Carrus et al., 2008, Taylor, 2007) desire as a sufficient impetus for intention formation was the most important latent variable. In the model, the more important determinants to desire were the emotional factors, specifically positive anticipated emotion while the other determinants such as the subjective norm, attitude, and negative anticipated emotions are less important to the prediction of desire. It is not problematic that all antecedent variables in the EMGB do not make a considerable contribution to behavioral intention because the relative importance of individual antecedent variables in a model may differ based on given contexts (Sparks & Pan, 2009).",

However, it did influence international travel intentions indirectly through personal NPI. This Korean data suggests that the perception of 2009 H1N1 did not constrain the desire for international travel among potential tourists as they had some adaptive behavior in mind which lowered the infection threat to a level acceptable to them. In effect, personal NPI are an adaptive behavior which reinforce the desire that supports their behavioral intention. This coincides with the findings of Raude and Setbon (2009, p. 342) that the French public has moderately adaptive beliefs and attitudes about new infectious respiratory illnesses which lead them to personal NPI as a means for lowering contagion risks.",

First, the intention to travel internationally is resilient during a global pandemic because potential international tourists perceive personal NPI like hand washing, mask wearing, and information gathering as plausible protective behaviors while taking a trip. This approach may not be shared by all tourists because socioeconomic characteristics are linked to variations in health outcomes (Raude & Setbon, 2009), so educational initiatives are needed. For example, guidelines for NPI hygiene should be continually available alongside other safety information in airline onboard publications. Also, tourism operators can improve their online communications concerning pandemic diseases to reassure tourists of their relative safety and reduce their apprehension about traveling. Second, in addition to public restrooms, transport and hospitality services should provide convenient NPI hygiene and information kiosks within their facilities which support self-protective health behavior by staff, passengers, or guests. Because personal NPI are the adaptive behavior of many potential tourists who wish to proceed with their journey during a pandemic when uncertainty surrounds administrative disease control measures and the efficacy and availability of pharmaceutical interventions. For example, if designed for high usage these kiosks can provide multiple hand cleaning devices and multi-lingual displays of current health risks at regular locations in airport boarding lounges.",

Because the global reach of novel influenza-like viruses and the limits of mandatory administrative NPI, such as border control and passenger screening techniques, provide tourism businesses with opportunities for good corporate citizenship and for health related competitive advantages. For example, transport systems and hospitality services should implement staff training in personal NPI for their own benefit and for them to better assist their passengers and their guests. This could be promoted as a \u201cGreen & Clean\u201d certification process developed by cooperation between tourism businesses and health agencies.
