As one of critical neurological diseases, early and effective treatment is important for TBI patients. Emergency surgery under unclear diagnosis of COVID-19 was challenging for psychological and professional capacities of medical staff. How to protect both medical staff and the patient was our major concern. Based on the clinical practice of 8 cases of TBI combined with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we summarized the following points. (1) Preoperative screening was crucial. In the absence of PCR results of coronavirus, it was important to identify pneumonia caused by vomiting and aspiration or COVID-19. Multidisciplinary consultation was recommended. Preoperative preparation for surgery should be adequate to avoid opening the door of the operating room during the operation. The protective measures, such as antifog agent for goggles, were necessary. (2) Surgical personnel should take level III protection. Adequate sedation and muscle relaxation were given to reduce time of tracheal intubation. Optimal surgical scheme, proficiency surgical skill, reduced surgical steps on the principle of damage control surgery and shortening of operation time were also important. (3) After surgery, medical staff should wash and disinfect themselves, the operating room was sterilized and the specimen was preserved in formaldehyde as soon as possible. Postoperative transportation was under level III protection to prevent patients from coughing and pipelines from falling off. The PCR test of coronavirus was conducted after surgery. All visits were forbidden during the epidemic period, and the family members were recommended to contact the doctor by phone or online.",
