The serial interval was 3.24 days, and 27.5% (95% confidence interval, 15.7%-40.0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically.

Many infections are asymptomatic 7 , while others lead to symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) of varying severity 5 . Analyses of serial intervals suggest that contagiousness starts before the onset of symptoms 8 . The exponential rise in infections has threatened to overwhelm even the world's best developed health systems and cause major loss of life.

Many affected countries have resorted to extreme social distancing measures through so-called 'lockdowns', where populations isolate themselves within their homes, reducing all but essential contact with others. As first observed in Hubei Province in China, and subsequently in other countries, these measures slow transmission and reduce disease incidence, but at significant social and economic cost [9] [10] [11] . However, 'lockdowns' represent a combination of potentially independent interventions (for example, closing schools and universities, suspending public transport, banning public gatherings, closing non-essential businesses), the effects of which in isolation are uncertain. Determining their relative contributions to SARS-CoV-2 control is critical to understanding how they might be safely and incrementally lifted, or partially reinstated. Such information may be acquired from studying the measures employed by countries that have so far controlled the virus.",

An estimated 27.5% (95% CI, 15.7%-40.0%) of the distribution was below zero, suggesting these transmissions occurred prior to the onset of symptoms in the infector. From the (non-quarantined) imported cases (G0) and onward infected cases (G1 and G2+), we calculated the effective reproductive number R by date (Figure 1 ). Limited transmission amounted to a maximum R of 1.15 (95% CI, 0.37-2.36). R rarely exceeded 1 and a decrease of R is seen as more mitigating measures were implemented from the end of March before the nationwide lockdown. When analyzing R from G0 to G1 (step 1) and from G1 to G2+ (step 2) separately, we found that R was drastically decreased for step 1 simultaneously with suspension of all international travel (March 18 th ), while for step 2 transmission continues with R slightly above 1 despite intense contact tracing and quarantine.

The strength of our report is that it provides a complete national picture of case numbers, their clinical and demographic characteristics, and the testing performed and various interventions made by the Government over time. Further, the use of systematic quarantine measures allowed clear distinction between imported and domestically-acquired cases, thus allowing for estimation of the efficiency of various interventions. The limitations are that the data are descriptive, contain relatively small numbers of confirmed cases, and only include the first 100 days of an epidemic that is likely to continue for many months. It is therefore impossible to conclude definitively which of these control measures have resulted in the current control of SARS-CoV-2 in Vietnam and whether they will continue to work in the future.",

On February 13 th , these communes were quarantined for three weeks, with no additional cases detected in the country until March 6 th and the start of the second wave of infections in Hanoi. This second wave began following the March 6 th diagnosis of the index case, who had arrived in Hanoi on March 2 nd after visiting Italy and the UK. Following diagnosis, all passengers and crew who had been on the flight from London with the index case were quarantined in Government facilities for 14 days, as were all individuals in direct contact with the index or subsequent cases. The immediate neighborhood of the index case was sealed off, with active surveillance conducted to detect any new cases. These surveillance measures revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 12 others on the flight and 2 close contacts of the infected traveler after entering Vietnam. Further cases occurred in the following two weeks, mostly in foreign and returning Vietnamese travelers from Europe and the USA, including multiple acquisitions in a Ho Chi Minh City bar on March 14 th (19 cases), a cluster among nursing (17 cases) and catering (28 cases) staff in a large Hanoi hospital, and a community cluster in Me Linh district (13 cases), in the north of Hanoi. Systematic layered testing and quarantine requirements were put in place for cases (F0) and their direct (F1) and indirect (F2-4) contacts. Cases were isolated in assigned hospitals until tested negative at least twice by RT-PCR. F1 and F2 contacts were quarantined for at least 14 days in dedicated facilities (health centers, hotels, military camps) with negative tests required before release. F3 and F4 contacts were asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Until May 1 st , around 70,000 have been quarantined in Government facilities, twice as many at home or in hotels, and 266,122 RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests have been conducted (1 positive person: 1,000 tests conducted).",

To date, around 200,000 people have spent at least 14 days in quarantine. Amongst those quarantined, many were second degree contacts (F2); to our knowledge, no other country has implemented quarantine in this manner. 266,122 RT-PCR tests have been performed, primarily in those quarantined, giving a high ratio of tests conducted per positive person (~1:1000). The majority of cases (60%) in Vietnam were imported among those arriving from COVID-19 affected countries; first China and then Europe and the USA. Early introduction of airport screening, followed by quarantine of all arrivals and the eventual suspension of nearly all international flights prevented further introductions, allowing greater focus on the detection and prevention of domestic transmission. Consistent and pervasive Government communication of disease risk and prevention strategies from February 3 rd may have contributed to declines in population movement prior to the nationwide lockdown, particularly in March, when all mobile phone users received 10 SMS texts from the Ministry of Health in addition to information provided through other media; these early reductions in population movement may have contributed to lowering the reproduction number. The majority of imported cases were less than 30 years old (many were university students returning from studies abroad), and most of those that acquired the infection domestically were under 40 years, which may explain the low numbers with severe disease and absence of deaths.",

The values of these relative indices are fixed at 0 (horizontal line) on January 13 th . The hashed area indicates the lunar New Year holiday (23-29 th January). Traditionally, the first half of the week is spent at home with close family, whereas the second half of the week is dedicated to visits of members of the extended family. Panel C: number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases hospitalized and RT-PCR tests performed by day. Panel D: cumulative number of detected SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Vietnam, differentiating imported cases (G0) and whether they were isolated at entry or later, and locally transmitted cases and whether they were in direct contact with imported cases (G1) or not (G2+)). Panel E: numbers of SARS-CoV-2 imported cases together with cumulative numbers of local transmissions. Circled characters indicate major internal transmission events: first introduction of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the country (1: 16 cases), second introduction (2: 15 cases), cluster of transmission in a Ho Chi Minh City bar (B: 19 cases), cluster of transmission in a large Hanoi hospital (H: 17 cases), community cluster of transmission linked to the Hanoi hospital through catering staff (T: 28 cases) and community cluster of transmission in Me Linh district in the north of Hanoi (M: 13 cases). Panels F-H: estimates of the reproduction number for the two epidemics. G focuses only on the first step of the chain of transmission between G0 and G1, whereas H focuses on all the other steps of the chain of transmission. F includes all detected cases.",

Dots and errors bar show mean and 95% confidence interval (assuming a gamma distribution) per decile of age, lines and shaded areas show gamma regression fits and their 95% confidence intervals. Panel C: relationship between age and the proportion asymptomatic among 208 discharged SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. Vertical dotted lines indicate deciles of the age distribution, with the proportion asymptomatic estimated within each of these deciles. Vertical error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Panel D: distribution of serial intervals for 33 infector-infectee pairs together with a normal distribution fitted to it. The shaded area shows the 95% confidence interval. The vertical black line shows the estimate of the mean serial interval, together with its 95% confidence interval (dashed vertical lines).
