First, the polycarbonate microdevice was fabricated by thermal bonding to contain microchambers as reservoirs for performing SP-PCR. Next, the microchambers were subsequently modified with polyethyleneimine and glutaraldehyde for immobilizing amine-modified forward primers. During SP-PCR, the immobilized forward primers and freely diffusing fluorescence-labeled reverse primers cooperated to generate target amplicons, which remained covalently attached to the microchambers for the fluorescence detection. The SP-PCR microdevice was used for the direct identifications of two widely detected foodborne pathogens, namely Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus, and an alga causing harmful algal blooms annually in South Korea, Cochlodinium polykrikoides. The SP-PCR microdevice would be versatilely applied in PON testing as a universal platform for the fast identification of foodborne pathogens and environmentally threatening biogenic targets.

Attributed to the ability to quickly make several copies of genetic materials, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used as a molecular diagnostic method in biomedical and biochemical research (Clerc and Greub, 2010; Craw and Balachandran, 2012; Law et al., 2014; Niemz et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2016; Visciano et al., 2016; Zhang & Ozdemir, 2009 & Mu\u00f1oz, 2007) . Advances in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) techniques have enabled the miniaturization and integration of several functional components of PCR, allowing timely detection of biomolecular targets with a better analytical performance. Among several variations of PCR, solid-phase PCR (SP-PCR) is a promising method for developing integrated LOC platforms because it enables amplification followed by immediate detection of DNA.",

Most of the reported SP-PCR LOC platforms have focused on the surface modification of solid substrates for the immobilization of solid-support primers. Despite the noticeable improvements highlighted in these systems, disadvantages remain, which need to be overcome. Specifically, a microarray platform for the genotyping of human mutation genes was developed (Damin, Galbiati, Ferrari, & Chiari, 2016) . However, that platform requires the synthesis of a copolymer coated onto the substrate surface for the immobilization of primers, which demands extensive and time-consuming preparation steps. An organosilanization method was also introduced to immobilize primers (J. Hoffmann, S. Hin et al., 2012) . Although this approach is compatible with SP-PCR, the reproducibility of the coating chemistry depends on highly controlled operative conditions. Besides, the use of bulky apparatuses for the plasma activation of the substrate surface before the coating procedures used in both the abovementioned studies may not meet the conditions of resource-poor laboratories. These shortcomings hamper the realization of an SP-PCR microdevice.",

Also, PEI was more effective than 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in functionalizing the PC surface with amine groups and forming more stable bonds against hydrolytic cleavage (Supporting Information Figure S2c ).

Figures S2-S4) , the continuous changes in temperature during the thermal cycling program resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in the fluorescence intensity after thermal treatment (P > 0.05).

The thermal-induced fluorescence decrease in this study was comparable or even lower to that reported from a study using a copolymer coated on silicon substrates (Damin et al., 2016) . A greater loss of fluorescence (31.1%-55.6%) under thermal cycling conditions was also reported for the immobilization of DNA on cyclic olefin copolymer or polymer, polypropylene, polydimethylsiloxane, and glass using 1,4-diphenylene diisothiocyanate, a homobifunctional cross-linker (J.

The preliminary data obtained in this study showed that thermally stable bonds were established between the immobilized primers and the solid substrate, which confirms the capability of the surface modification strategy to realize SP-PCR using our developed PC microfluidic platform.

For comparison, homogeneous PCR, which was normal on-chip PCR, was also performed similarly to evaluate the efficiency of SP-PCR. The collected on-chip PCR products were captured by the PEI-GA-coated microchambers, which were then washed to measure the fluorescence signals of the immobilized amplicons. To confirm the accuracy of dilutions, off-chip PCR reactions were first carried out using a commercial thermal cycler, and the amplicons were analyzed using gel electrophoresis. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S8 , the intensities of target bands decreased with decreasing concentration of DNA template, confirming the precision of the dilution series. Figure 6 shows the sensitivity comparison between SP-PCR and homogeneous PCR and their corresponding fluorescence images. As shown in Figure 6a , the efficiency of SP-PCR was generally lower than that of the homogeneous PCR probably due to the steric interactions between the freely diffusing primers and solid-support primers in SP-PCR, as mentioned above. Despite this lower efficiency, the fluorescence signals of the immobilized amplicons in SP-PCR were clearly observed compared with homogeneous PCR. The lowest amount of DNA template at which fluorescence signal can still be observed was 32.5 copies of gDNA. The signals increased with increasing amount of DNA template and almost remained stable when the amount of DNA template was 3.25 \u00d7 10 5 copies, indicating the saturation of the surface coating with the amplicons.",

The simple and reliable immobilization of amine-modified primers for SP-PCR was successfully realized by a robust two-step surface modification of PC with PEI and GA. The chemical coatings on the surface of the microchambers exhibited a high stability under thermal cycling condition with 85.3% of the immobilized PCR amplicons remaining after the thermal treatment. The obtained results showed the possibility of using a monolithic plastic platform for the simultaneous amplification and detection of not only prominent foodborne pathogens but also microalgae that annually cause harmful algal blooms. This versatility ensures the wide and universal applicability of the introduced platform as a portable PON testing device, while extending its ranges to other molecular analyses, including gene expression, mutation analysis, and genotyping.

After primer immobilization, the microchambers were washed with 0.1\u00d7 SSC and 0.1% SDS solutions to remove the unreacted primers. The microchambers were then rinsed with deionized water and dried with compressed air. As shown in Figure 1b, three microchambers immobilized with three types of amine-modified primers were used for subsequent SP-PCR to detect three microbial targets. Besides the PCR reagents, the PCR mixture contained an asymmetric concentration of floating forward primers and fluorescence-modified primers in the ratio of 1:4. For SP-PCR, the amplification undergoes two phases. First, liquid-phase amplification occurs preferably to generate a number of double-stranded and single-stranded DNA that have the fluorescence dyes. When the limited number of forward primers was depleted, solid-phase amplification becomes dominant, resulting in the formation of amplicons covalently attached to the surface of the microchamber, allowing the on-site detection of target amplicons by collecting their fluorescence signals inside the microchambers.",

Water contact angles were also used to evaluate the hydrolytic resistance of PEI-coated PC under thermal cycling condition after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 thermal cycles. A Phoenix 300 contact angle analyzer (Surface Electro Optics, Suwon, Korea) was used for the analyses with the sessile drop method. The obtained results were analyzed with Image Pro 300 software. Measurements were made five times and averaged. 2.4 | Characterization of surface modification (2): Quantification of amine density coated on PC To quantify the density of amine groups on the surface of PEI-coated PC, a fluorescence measurement was performed using FITC, which can react with amine groups. A standard curve was established by spotting different concentrations of PEI (0-50 nmol) coupled with 0.1 mg ml -1 FITC and measuring the fluorescence signal. The actual density of amine groups coated on PC was quantified by staining the PEI-coated PC substrates with FITC and comparing the fluorescence signal with the standard curve. A fluorescence signal was detected and analyzed using the Gel Doc EZ system (Bio-Rad) and the Image Lab 4.0 software (Bio-Rad). Differences in the fluorescence signals were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's pairwise comparison with 95% confidence intervals using Minitab version 16 (Minitab, State College, PA).",

The water contact angle of the pristine PC was approximately 80.1\u00b0\u00b1 0.96\u00b0, which decreased significantly to 32.8\u00b0\u00b1 4.55\u00b0after PEI treatment and then increased slightly to 53.5\u00b0\u00b1 5.41\u00b0after GA activation. These results were in accordance with those reported in other studies (Gunda, Singh, Norman, Kaur, & Mitra, 2014; Jankowski, Ogo\u0144czyk, Lisowski, & Garstecki, 2012; M. Jang, C. K. Park, & Lee, 2014; M. Jang, S. Park, & Lee, 2014). As shown in Figure 2, changes in the wettability of the substrate surface after each coating step confirmed the successful modification of PC with PEI and subsequently with GA. The PC surface was rendered hydrophilic after the PEI treatment due to the presence of positive charges of dense amine groups decorated on the surface of PC. Amine functional groups were previously reported to directly react with the carbonate backbones of PC chains to form stable urethane linkages (M. Jang, S. Park et al., 2014). This advantage simplifies the modification procedure by getting rid of prior surface oxidation by plasma, allowing the microchambers to be chemically modified Water contact angles measured on pristine PC, PEI-coated PC, and PEI-GA-coated PC substrates.

The next step of activating PEI-coated PC with GA made the surface relatively hydrophobic compared with the earlier PEI treatment alone, probably due to the existence of hydrocarbon chains of GA. Sodium cyanoborohydride was used to reduce the Schiff base bonds formed between aldehyde and amine groups to stable and irreversible secondary amine bonds. The reducing agent targets Schiff bases while sparing free aldehyde groups for the conjugation of amine-modified oligonucleotides(Migneault, Dartiguenave, Bertrand, & Waldron, 2004).",

Figure 3c-e shows the fluorescence images of the PEI-GA-coated microchamber immobilized with PCR amplicons, the pristine microchamber only, and the PEI-GA-coated microchamber only, respectively. As shown in Figure 3c, the strong green fluorescence of the immobilized amplicons with a low signal background after washing indicated that the PC surface modified with PEI and GA could capture amine-modified PCR amplicons. Control experiments were also performed to evaluate the inherent autofluorescence property of PC (Piruska et al., 2005). The pristine microchamber did not display noticeable fluorescence signals (Figure 3d) even after coating (Figure 3e). From those results, we could conclude that the amine-modified PCR amplicons were successfully captured on the PEI-GA-coated microchambers, as demonstrated by the green fluorescence signal. The surface of PC was successfully modified with PEI and GA within approximately 3 hr without preactivation with plasma, which was not time-consuming as well as did not require extensive coating steps or long-time synthesis of chemicals used for the modification process.",

Figure 5a shows the results for the amplifications of nuc gene (S. aureus), invA gene (Salmonella spp.), and LSU rRNA gene (C. polykrikoides) performed in both pristine and PEI-GA-coated microchambers. On the basis of the result of gel electrophoresis, the intensities of the target bands amplified from both pristine and coated microchambers were almost identical. The results were reproducible as indicated by the similar intensities of the amplicons in three targets, demonstrating that the surface coatings did not affect the DNA amplification efficiency.3.6 | On-chip SP-PCR: Simultaneous amplification and detection of microbial targetsAfter demonstrating the stability of the surface coatings and realizing on-chip PCR, simultaneous solid-phase amplification and detection of three microbial targets was realized using the SP-PCR microdevice.As shown inFigure5b, the existence of immobilized amplicons was confirmed through the distinct fluorescence signals of Alexa 647 designed for Salmonella spp. and Alexa 488 designed for both S. aureus and C. polykrikoides. The signals indicated that all three targets were successfully amplified and remained covalently attached to the microchambers after the withdrawal of the solution and the subsequent washing steps. The negative controls of each target displayed no fluorescence signal, confirming the absence of nonspecific adsorption of fluorescence-labeled reverse primers.
