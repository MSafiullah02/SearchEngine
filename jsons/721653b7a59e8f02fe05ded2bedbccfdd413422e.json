Furthermore, the scope of practice among IR services has been changing dramatically in response to shifting demands. Literature discusses the impact of COVID-19 on workflow and preparedness in IR practice, highlighting isolation strategies and infection control. 1, 2 Equally important and less discussed, however, has been the unique value that IR can provide in a pandemic effort. This paper discusses the integral role that IR has played in the COVID-19 response of a large multi-center medical system in [blinded]. Specifically, the adaptability of IR to changing pressures and workflows will be discussed in the context of critical care and multidisciplinary support.",

As a result, disproportionate pressure has been placed on the intensive care unit (ICU). In this context, the spectrum of techniques in IR have significant utility. In this institution, IR/DR and upcoming Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology (ESIR) trainees have been redeployed to the ICUs as rotating residents. The residents' skills as radiologists and proceduralists are typically valuable on their standard post-graduate year 5 (PGY-5) in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) rotations. Deploying junior residents to ICUs during staff shortages has demonstrated the value of IR in the critical care setting. Residents place ultrasound guided venous and arterial lines, perform bedside ultrasound imaging, and interpret portable chest radiographs for the clinical teams. The clinical and clerical throughput of the ICU has been managed with trainees writing notes, filling orders, fielding consults, handling admissions, processing discharges, and rounding. Crucially, the supporting staff including IR nursing staff are trained in critical care and have also been relocated to ad hoc ICU settings throughout the hospital.",

Prior to this pandemic, this institution performed primarily outpatient procedures with 60% of cases on an elective basis, encompassing women's/men's health and interventional oncology (IO). As priorities shifted, it was decided that outpatient clinics would cease would transition increasingly to telehealth, and procedures would be limited solely to urgent and emergent procedures in concordance with societal recommendations. 3 During the past month of the crisis, case breakdown shifted to be less than 40% outpatient. Over 125 inpatient procedures have been performed on COVID-19 patients across six hospitals, including approximately 60 procedures being performed at the bedside in the last two weeks alone. Even in IO, where maintenance of caseload was intended as much as possible, an analysis from March 12 to April 11, 2020 demonstrated a reduction in IO caseload as the pandemic progressed ( Figure 2 ). Of note, the number of inpatient consults at the academic medical center to the department decreased from 4.8 consults per day in January to merely 3.5 consults per day in March. IR departments must leverage their unique abilities and shift focus to most directly address the pandemic.",

An overall increase was observed in the number of requests for gastrostomy tube catheters and peritoneal dialysis, likely due to a reduction in endoscopy services and increased strain on inpatient hemodialysis resources, respectively. Furthermore, as anesthesia resources became increasingly limited, the department collaborated with nursing staff to adequately select patients who required only conscious sedation. After supporting other departments, subsequent emphasis was placed on procedures that would limit the movement of patients and spread of infection. This translated to an increase in ultrasound-guided interventions such as paracentesis, central line placement, and abscess drainage. 4 In these ways, the department supported triage not just at the patient level, but at a multidisciplinary and department level.",
