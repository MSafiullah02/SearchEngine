The spread of anthrax through the US mail in 2001 heightened concern about the feasibility of large-scale dispersal of bioagents by terrorist groups. B. anthracis was delivered by mail to various recipients and chiefly intended to cause inhalational anthrax disease. Twenty-two cases were identified, 11 of them inhalational associated with 5 fatalities, 7 confirmed as cutaneous, and 4 suspected cutaneous cases. 23 Aerosolized anthrax spores of 2-3 \u03bcm can pass through the bronchi to the alveoli and be transported via the lymphatics to the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, where germination to the bacillary form may occur. 8 Spore may not immediately germinate and may continue to vegetate in the host for several weeks after inhalation. After alveolar macrophages incorporate the spores, the spores germinate and begin replication. That replication releases several toxins, leading to hemorrhagic thoracic lymphadenopathy and mediastinitis, edema, and necrosis. Hemorrhagic meningitis frequently develops and can be observed in up to half of patients. The median incubation period from exposure to the onset of symptoms is 4 days (range 1-7 days), but cases that occurred from 2 to 43 days after exposure have been reported in humans. This period seems to be inversely related to the dose of spores. It is assumed that a dose of 8,000-50,000 spores is sufficient to cause inhalational anthrax. 24 Early diagnosis is essential for saving lives. The clinical presentation of the disease is classically biphasic. It starts with nonspecific symptoms of sore throat, mild fever, and muscle aches. The patient may also present nonproductive cough, dyspnea, headache, vomiting, chills, weakness, abdominal pain, malaise, and chest pain. 20, 8, 24 Physical examination is usually unremarkable, but chest examination can reveal bilateral decreased breath sounds, rhonchi, and/or inspiratory rales.",

It can still be considered as an option only if the strain is susceptible to this drug. Since there have been reports of resistant strains and it is not complicated to induce resistance to penicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, macrolides, and rifampicine, 29 ciprofloxacin is currently the recommended first-line treatment as described in Table 12 .4. Moreover, recommendations include administering one or two additional antibiotics in the case of inhalational anthrax, for example, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, or vancomycin. 23, 26, 30 For inhalation anthrax, the duration of treatment is at least 60 days. For cutaneous anthrax, duration of treatment is 7-10 days. The same antibiotics are recommended for postexposure prophylaxis as for treatment of the disease. Oral ciprofloxacin is also recommended as a first choice for prophylaxis for those who are at risk, and must be taken for at least 60 days.

Muscle function returns after 3-6 months as the neuromuscular junction regenerates. In the United States, investigational pentavalent (A-E) botulinum toxoid vaccine is used for laboratory workers at high risk of exposure and by military personnel. Immunity is induced slowly by this vaccine, and frequent boosters are required. 45 Tularemia Francisella tularensis is a nonmotile, obligatory aerobic, facultative intracellular Gram-negative coccobacillus. One of the most infectious pathogenic bacteria known, ten organisms are sufficient to initiate human infection. 48 Inhalational tularemia following intentional release of a virulent strain of F. tularensis would have great impact and cause high morbidity and mortality. Another route of contamination in a deliberate release could be contamination of water. 49 ",

Patients may die of organ failure and shock. Usually asymptomatic or mild illness. The onset of the disease is insidious with fever and general malaise over a 2 -4 day period. In more severe cases; weakness, retroorbital pain, joint and lumbar pain, myalgia, headache, pharyngitis, cough and conjunctival injection.In the most severe form of the disease; prostration; abdominal pain, facial and neck edema, hemorrhages (conjunctival hemorrhages, mucosal bleeding, melena, hematochezia, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, hematemesis), encephalitis, capillary leak syndrome and shock. Hepatitis is frequent. Pulmonary manifestations can be significant with ARDS. Long-term sequelae of Lassa infection; sensorineural deafness. Hemorrhage, and neurological signs are more common; hemorrhage along the gingival margins is characteristic. Neurologic signs may include delirium, confusion, encephalopathy, convulsions and coma.
