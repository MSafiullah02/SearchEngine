The GC is an 13 accessible integrated model which calculates the cumulative emissions of a basket of the main greenhouse gases that 14 result from a set of technological and lifestyle choices made at the global level and as defined by the user within a 15 single system dynamics tool. Using the GC, we simulated ambitious scenarios against business as usual trends in order 16 to stay below 2 o C and 1.5 o C of maximum temperature change by the end of this century and carried out a sensitivity 17 analysis of the entire GC model option space. We show that the calculator is useful for making broad simulations for 18 energy, carbon and land use dynamics, and demonstrate how combined and sustained mitigation efforts across 19 different sectors are urgently needed to meet climate targets.",

            "text": "The Global Calculator 1 (GC) is a pioneering initiative aimed at informing the climate debate at the international level, 23 by providing a relatively simple and highly accessible systems tool for policy makers, business leaders, NGOs and econometric model or a profit-optimization model. Optimisation functionality is instead passed to the user who makes 88 combinations of choices and is immediately shown the impacts arising from that set of choices (a pathway). The 89 calculator also provides a novel approach to assess energy demand and supply dynamics. The user begins by defining 90 or setting levels of core 'activities' (e.g., the amount of protein-rich food eaten, the distance travelled, the level of 91 heating and cooling needed for residential and commercial buildings), and then choses (and setting) the food, transport 92 and building solutions that enable those activities (or services) to be provided. For example, once these choices are 93 made, the overall demand for food is calculated and defines the impacts on land resources given the set of 94 technological choices for the provision of the food as made by the end-user (or as default settings under a given pre-95 defined pathway). All the pathways available will be defined by the set of services (activities) demanded and the 96 associated products (fertilisers, cars, houses and windmills) needed to supply those services, which in turn, are 97 manufactured with associated demand for resources (fuels, minerals, biomass, etc.) calculated. All activities, services 98 and product provision use energy which needs to be produced, transported and stored. Finally, both energy demand 99 and supply use fuel resources. This enables the model to be used to assess the impact of both behavioural (e.g., eating 100 and heating habits, modal switching in transport) and technological changes (e.g., electric vehicles, renewable energy 101 (wind, PV, hydro and biomass) and product innovation). To become operational, the calculator deploys a number of representative levers, which are all interconnected as a 106 broad integrated system that may vary over time. A lever is an issue that may substantially affect greenhouse gas forth, by using interpolation between whole levels. Some few levels do not have this type of growing levels of carbon 114 mitigation effort; instead, they vary from levels A to D, given that this variation may not necessarily reduce or increase 115 emissions, comparatively to each other, this would depend on the broad scenario. For example, the GC has a lever 116 about bioenergy provision, which can be offered as either liquid or solid biofuels (note: biogas is a consequential 117 energy from anaerobic digestion) and, hence, the emissions would depend on how they are integrated in their 118 respective commodity chains across the other sectors of the calculator. Further explanations about the levers' levels of 119 all sectors and how they were calibrated can be found in the supporting documentation available on the GC website. A 120 brief explanation about the levers' calibration is also available on dedicated pagers, by clicking on the information 121 icon beside each lever on the calculator's web tool. The focus of this paper is to run some selected scenarios and a sensitivity analysis of the entire model, similarly to the 126 assessment carried out by Elizondo to exemplify the level of effort that would be required to hold the increase in Global temperature 'to well-below 2\u00b0C, 143 and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C' by 2100 , as stated in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement [8]. The temperature 144 change calculated is for the year 2100 and represents a 50% chance of keeping temperature below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C, 145 respectively, based on the GHG abatement contributions and energy use by 2050, extrapolated to 2100. These 146 scenarios are compared with a Business-As-Usual (BAU) pathway, as described below. Further information on the 147 assumptions underpinning each of the lever levels is available from the GC web tool. distributed pathway was originally developed by the DECC et al. [5] , not to be confused with the 'IEA2DS' example 162 pathway that is also available in the GC. There is an increased ambition from both sides of energy markets, demand 163 and supply, when compared to the BAU case. In addition to energy, land is used with more efficient land use The third scenario is a new simulation that represents an even higher mitigation effort that is required to meet the In terms of demography, all three pathways assume that the global population will rise from the current 7.3 billion to In order to replicate these three proposed simulations (i.e., BAU, 1.5D and 2D) directly on the web tool, 197 Table 1 provides the levels of effort used here for simulating each of the three pathways according to the assessed 198 scenario. It is worth noting that the calculator is able to present a large number of mitigation pathways, resulting from 199 the combinatorics of all levers' levels (and intermediate levels) and, therefore, these three chosen scenarios were 200 selected to demonstrate the functionality of the calculator. There are a number of other example pathways available on 201 the web tool, including scenarios proposed by businesses and NGOs. In addition, the GC offers an approximate 202 representation of the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways 5 (RCPs) for 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5 W/m 2 of radiative 203 forcing 6 in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels, whilst these radiative forcing levels are derived from 204 different GHG concentration trajectories [7] . Although the representation of RCPs in the GC was not assessed in this 205 article, they are also available in the list of example pathways shown on the GC's web tool. 206 207 5 The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) provides a number of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for assessing ranges of potential global warming scenarios. Each RCP represents an equivalent radiative forcing effect in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels, such as, +2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 W/m 2 , globally. 6 The term radiative forcing has been used by the IPCC to represent a perturbation in the radiative energy balance of the Earth's climate system, for example, due to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Many consider a 6 o C increase in global mean surface temperature 226 by 2100 as catastrophic for human development and potentially incompatible with viable ecosystem functioning. In 227 terms of costs, this scenario is considered used as a baseline for the economy. The 2 o C scenario, instead, considers a 228 trajectory that results in the generation of 18.5 GtCO 2 eq per year in 2050 with an abatement of 65.in terms of efficiency, the 2 o C scenario reduces energy demand by 28% by 2050, going from 610 234 EJ to 434 EJ (Figure 3). When increasing the target ambition to limiting temperature increase to 1.5 o C, energy demand 235 reduces by 39% (370 EJ in 2050).

Deferrals in these very substantial GHG reductions in the short term then exacerbate the need for 274 higher reductions afterwards, otherwise to face potential severe climate change impacts. Future versions of the GC 275could update the historical data used the model and the accuracy of these trajectories, but apart from the modelling 276 limitations and the several uncertainties involved in this type of simulation, the results highlight the urgent need for Prepared by the authors, using the Global Calculator.280As a comparison of the magnitudes of the emissions trajectories simulated, the IPCC's RCP 2.6 W/m 2 scenario also 281 assumes that global GHG emissions peak between 2010 and 2020, declining thereafter, and the simulation of this RCP 282 trajectory in the GC results in 16.2 GtCO 2 eq.y -1 in 2050, as shown on the example pathways of the GC web tool.283Another comparative example is the FT climate change calculator[1], which shows that the 2 o C pathway would284 require global emissions not to exceed 20 GtCO 2 eq.y -1 in 2050. The FT calculator also demonstrates that if all INDCs 285 were implemented as proposed in the context of the Paris Agreement, GHG emissions would reach around 286 50GtCO 2 eq.y -1 in 2050, i.e. well above the UNFCCC targets, with combined emissions from China, United States, 287 European Union, India, Russia, Japan, Australia, Brazil and Canada responsible for more than half of these total 288 emissions. In a similar context, Rogelj et al. [11] assessed the assumptions behind the NDCs of the UNFCCC's 289 Member States and estimated that their emissions would range from 47 to 63 GtCO 2 eq.y -1 in 2030, and that this 290 uncertainty has critical implications for meeting temperature change targets. 291 In terms of emissions by activity/sector (Figure 9), in 2030, under the 6 o C BAU scenario, most of the emissions would 292 come from fuel combustion (65%), followed distantly by agriculture (11%). This split does not change much for 293 neither the 2 o C scenario nor the 1.5 o C scenario with the sharpest increase in emissions between 2010 (actual data) and 294 2030 seen in industrial processing activities for the 6 o C scenario whereas the sharpest decrease in emissions for the 295 2 o C scenario between 2010 and 2030 happens in the land use and forestry sector, which becomes a net sink already by 296 2030. This is also the case for the 1.5 o C scenario. In both distributed-effort scenarios, emissions coming from 297 industrial processing increase by 42% and 37%, respectively, between 2010 and 2030. 298 For 2050, in the 6 o C scenario, the largest share of emissions comes from fuel combustion (61% of total), followed by 299 land use and forestry (18%), which has the highest proportional increase in emissions, with a 149% increase between 300 2011 and 2050, mainly because of deforestation and soil carbon changes. In the 2 o C scenario, by 2050, the highest 301 share of emissions comes from fuel combustion (48% of total); however, emissions from fuel combustion are only 302 slightly greater than those from agriculture, with the largest reductions in emissions occurring in the land use and 303 forestry activities. This is because rather than deforestation, an increase in Global forest cover by 2050 occurs, acting 304 as a source of negative emissions by sequestering carbon not only in the above ground vegetation but also as soil 305 carbon. Finally, in the 1.5 o C scenario, by 2050, global net GHG emissions undergo a very significant reduction, and 306 most emissions arise from agriculture (42%) followed distantly by fuel combustion (21%) with the sharpest decline in 307 emissions observed in the fuel combustion sector.

The impact of exclusive changes to the 315 levels of each lever compared to BAU in 2050, in terms of avoided emissions, are provided, as previously described in316 Methods (Section 2). Variations between levels 3 and 4 represent an extreme level of action, although still technically 317 possible. The levers related to diet and food production have the largest effects on GHG emissions. However, changes 318 in diet are related to lifestyle and cultural aspects and hence is considered likely to generate high levels of inertia 319 compared to BAU. A reduction in per capita meat consumption, especially beef, is calculated to reduce the demand 320 from pastureland and croplands for producing animal feed, freeing up land resources for other purposes, such as 321 afforestation/reforestation and the expansion of energy crops, both with substantial GHG savings. On the other hand, if 322 dietary patterns are kept at BAU levels, then increases in livestock and associated resource use efficiency, particularly 323 by increasing the global average number of ruminant animals per hectare (animal density on pasturelands), could also 324 free up land resources for other purposes. However, increasing fossil fuel use efficiency is also a key strategy for 325 reducing GHG emissions, as well as changes in global population, and other high impact levers. Some levers may not 326 show significant impacts depending on the level of ambition for carbon mitigation.

For 333 instance, the diet lever is related to a behavioural change rather than a technological innovation. Meat consumption, 334 particularly, has a very broad range of mitigation efforts: level 1 represents a pessimistic scenario with a substantial335 increase in global meat consumption with levels of consumption that are similar to those currently observed in the 336 European Union, i.e. much above global trends, which are more aligned with level 2, calibrated based on trends 337 suggested by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [12]. Setting level 3 results in a gradual reduction in 338 per capita meat consumption towards the 90g of meat per day suggested as a healthy level of consumption by the 339 World Health Organization (WHO) [13], and level 4, an extreme reduction is assumed, analogous to current per capita 340 meat consumption rates in India, where the majority of the population adopt a vegetarian diet. These changes have 341 major implications for GHG emissions, not only by reducing emissions from enteric fermentation of ruminant animals, 342 but also by allowing the expansion of forests and energy crops on freed-up land (aka surplus lands), with implications 343 also in terms of soil carbon balances, and even public health [14]. Such abrupt changes in global dietary patterns have 344 no precedent in recent history, yet they are assessed to be technically possible enabling their inclusion in the GC. Thus, 345 the interpretation of the sensitivity analysis requires an understanding of the assumptions behind each lever's level, 346 which are all described in the GC web tool and its supplementary documents. 347 Figure 11 shows the impact of each sector on global GHG emissions. It provides a sensitivity analysis assembling 348 levers according to reference sectors: travel (passenger distance, freight distance, mode, occupancy load, car own or 349 hire) & transport (transport efficiency, electric & hydrogen); homes (building size, temperature & hot water use, 350 lighting & appliance use, product lifespan & demand); diet i.e. changes in dietary patterns (calories consumed, 351 quantity of meat, type of meat); buildings (building insulation, temperature and cooking technology, appliance 352 efficiency); manufacturing (design materials & recycling, iron, steel & aluminium, chemicals, paper & other, and 353 cement); carbon capture and storage (CCS manufacturing, CCS electricity); fossil fuel (coal/oil/gas, fossil fuel 354 efficiency); nuclear (nuclear energy); renewables (wind, hydroelectricity, marine, solar, geothermal, storage & demand 355 shifting), food (crop yields, livestock -grains / residues fed, livestock -pasture fed, wastes & residues); land use 356 (surplus land -forest & bioenergy, land use efficiency); demographics (global population, urbanisation).

Moreover, the GC does not provide options for simulating the effects of carbon taxes or price elasticities regarding the adoption of different technologies and fuels, given that it is not an econometric model. On the other hand, this was not the aim of the GC, and this can be potentially complemented by other types of existing and future models, such as agent-based models, networks, and game theory models. The Financial Times' Calculator, as already cited in the Introduction (Section 1), does provide some simulations at country level, although only for major emitters. Several countries have their own national 2050 calculators (as also mentioned in the Introduction) and a similar assessment to this article was already performed for some them, such as for the Mexico 2050Calculator [16]  and the European Calculator[17], which does offer simulations at country level for its 28-Member States (EU-28).Another important observation is that the current version of the GC (version 23) does not include feedback-looping effects for assessing the impacts of climate change according to different carbon emissions trajectories, such as an increase in climate vulnerabilities (e.g. impacts on crop yields due to changes in temperature and rainfall) and adaptation costs (e.g. due to sea level rise in the coastal areas and to an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events) by 2050. Moreover, biodiversity and water balance issues were not directly covered in the GC, but some related variables were included in the recently published European Calculator.The GC is able to simulate a very large number of climate change mitigation pathways, as well as changes in the global energy mix and land use. The suggested distributed efforts for meeting the 2 o C and 1.5 o C targets show that these targets are still possible to be achieved, but that success in achieving them will require urgent and very substantial levels of effort across all sectors of the global economy. These simulations are illustrative pathways among many other possibilities that the world could take towards reducing GHG emissions. For example, the GC also allows simulations to be made that are focused on a higher use of solar photovoltaic systems and electric vehicles, with these highly cost effective technologies taking up a large share of the global energy supply, in a similar context to the analysis recently made bySussams et al. [18]  for disruptive changes in technology. Some other examples are pathways that are focused on dietary patterns and land use[2], and on sustainable transport systems in cities[3]. In addition, the calculator can compare carbon mitigation pathways to approximate representations of the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), providing useful insights for climate change analysts.The sensitivity analysis of the GC shows that there is no 'silver bullet' for carbon mitigation by 2050, demonstrating the contribution of each sector for reducing GHG emissions. It shows that all sectors are important to mitigate carbon emissions. However, it clearly highlights the importance of moving towards more sustainable diets, whilst also",
