            "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head affects 20 mn people worldwide, with more than 200,000 cases diagnosed annually in China1, 2. A multicenter review of 6395 patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head in China found that 24.1% of the cases, especially those without trauma, were steroid induced2. In addition, steroid\u2010induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) frequently occurs in young and middle\u2010aged people, and is associated with a high risk of disability since it involves bilateral femoral heads. Interestingly, numerous cases of SANFH emerged after SARS in 20033, 4, although the pathological basis remains unknown, thereby limiting prevention and treatment.",

Autophagy is an auto\u2010catabolic recycling process of eukaryotic cells that is frequently dysregulated in cancer, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, aging, etc7, 8, 9, 10. Our preliminary results show that SANFH is associated with autophagy, and the autophagy\u2010related Beclin 1 and microtubule\u2010associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3) are upregulated in osteoblasts11. Primary cilia are sensitive cellular antennae that sense and transmit external signals12, and coordinate the responsive mechanisms13. Recent studies show that the formation of primary cilia depends on autophagy14. The intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20) protein which regulates ciliary formation and length15, 16 is upregulated during starvation or lysosomal inhibition, and its knockdown during autophagy inhibits cilia formation17. IFT20 also recruits non\u2010ciliary proteins to the plasma membrane, which is the site of autophagosome formation. Furthermore, autophagy is significantly decreased when ciliary formation is disrupted, which is the basis of ciliated disease18. The oral facial digital syndrome\u20101 (OFD1) is a centrosome satellite protein that suppresses cilia formation, and its autophagic degradation promotes the biosynthesis of primary cilia19, 20.",

The purpose of this study is to: (i) determine whether primary ciliary formation disorder is associated with SANFH; (ii) determine whether osteoblast autophagy is associated with SANFH; and (iii) examine the relationship between primary cilia formation disorder and autophagy in osteoblasts under the action of Methylprednisolone.",

However, only 15% to 20% of the osteocytes in the femoral head were apoptotic in the mouse model of SANFH22, indicating other pathological mechanisms. Lane et al. found that glucocorticoids increase the gap between osteocytes, which results in the loss of minerals and disrupts bone metabolism independent of apoptosis23. Xia et al. first reported that dexamethasone increased autophagy in osteoblasts, which was verified in the primary osteoblasts isolated from prednisolone\u2010treated mice24. In the current study, we detected increased Beclin 1 expression in the femoral head tissues of a rabbit model of SANFH, indicating that autophagy is also a pathological basis of SANFH. This is consistent with a previous study which showed that inhibition of autophagy by 3\u2010MA retarded SANFH development in vivo\n25. Under physiological conditions with functioning osteoblasts, necrosis of the femoral head is repaired naturally. Therefore, glucocorticoids likely inhibit osteoblast function to aggravate SANFH. Luo et al. reported that Methylprednisolone increased autophagy in bone cells in a model of SANFH in a dose\u2010dependent manner, which also affects the interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts6. We found that Methylprednisolone upregulated the key autophagy genes in the osteoblasts, along with increasing autophagy flux.",

Delaine\u2010Smith et al. found that the primary cilia of osteoblasts responded to fluid shear stress and interstitial flow\u2010induced deposition of calcium in the bone26, which was confirmed by a later study27. We found that Methylprednisolone decreased the cilia length of osteoblasts by upregulating OFD1 and downregulating IFT20. This is consistent with the study of Tang et al., which showed that autophagy promoted cilia formation through selective degradation of OFD1. While LC3 specifically targeted OFD1 to the autophagy corpuscles for degradation, its centrosomal and basal parts were retained28. Pampliega et al. found that IFT20 was necessary for cilia formation and assembly, and was also degraded by autophagy to inhibit ciliation29. Taking both studies together, selective elimination of IFT20 during cell growth and proliferation hinders cilia formation while degradation of OFD1 during growth arrest promotes cilia formation. In this study, glucocorticoids gradually upregulated OFD1 and decreased IFT20 in the osteoblasts. We concluded, therefore, that glucocorticoids block the signal transduction of osteoblasts by selectively eliminating IFT20 during cell growth and proliferation.",

Wang et al. analyzed two renal cell lines with short and long cilia, and found that the former were activated by mTOR and resistant to autophagy31. In addition, Orhon et al. induced autophagy through the mechanical stress of fluid flow, which was regulated by the signal transduction pathway of primary cilia32, 33. Jang et al. found that inhibition of cilia\u2010mediated autophagy partly hindered neuroectoderm differentiation, underscoring the functional role of cilia in autophagy regulation34. Taken together, autophagy and cilia formation regulate each other, but the exact regulatory mechanism needs to be further studied.

This study is the effect of Methylprednisolone on osteoblasts and we cannot confirm whether other glucocorticoid have similar effects. Finally, this study can only confirm the relationship between osteoblast autophagy and primary cilia formation disorder in SANFH, but the exact regulatory mechanism is still unclear. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that excessive autophagy and primary cilia disruption are potential mechanisms underlying osteoblast loss in SANFH. To summarize, glucocorticoid disturbs primary cilia formation in osteoblasts, which likely affects osteogenesis and destroys the dynamic balance between bone generation and resorption, eventually leading to SAFH.",
