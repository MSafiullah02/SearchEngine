Effective implementation of Health Promoting School is a complex intervention involving multi-factorial and innovative activity in many domains such as curriculum, school environment and community. Many studies evaluating Health Promoting School do not include outcomes reflecting the organisational or structural change as many of those studies are quantitative in nature and the statistical assumptions are not valid reflecting the organisational structure changes. Recent global meetings of experts have reviewed the impact on student health from the perspectives of school environment, school policies on health, action competencies on healthy living and community linkage. The English Wessex Healthy School Award Scheme and the Hong Kong Healthy School Awards Scheme have developed detailed systems to analyse whether each individual school has reached the standard of a model Health Promoting School reflecting a more holistic appreciation and understanding of all the effects of school-based health promotion with positive award-related changes. However, not many schools are able to implement Health Promoting School in its entirety, so cores indicators are needed as a starting point for wider implementation. Hong Kong Healthy School Awards Scheme is still ongoing with data for analysis of indicators with significant correlation with better health and well-being. We identified the core indicators and substantiated the requirements for successful outcomes by supplementing the established award-scheme framework with a review of recent literature and documents.

Equipping schools with the capacity to tackle the 'Triple Health Burdens': the emergence of 'new' communicable diseases, the epidemics of non-communicable disease (NCD) and the global burden of mental health, should be the fundamental vision and mission of a school. The 'Triple Health Burdens\" are challenges for both developed and developing countries of the contemporary world. The emergence of 'new' communicable diseases (the unexpected outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003 with more than 1800 patients in over a dozen countries worldwide within two months, with clustering of cases in Hong Kong and Toronto [2] . The recent COVID-19 with over 1.1 millions confirmed cases globally (82, 930 confirmed cases in China, over 600,000 cases in Europe and over 300,000 in America as on 5 April 2020) in over 100 countries within less than 3 months since outbreak in China at the time of writing [3] . This reminds us of the dictum of public health practice, 'prevention better than cure' [2, 3] . This is true not only for infectious disease but also for NCD. In 2011, the United Nations adopted 'The Declaration of the Highlevel Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCD' [4] . The key action is to reduce risk factors and create health-promoting environments [5] . NCD accounts for one-third of premature deaths [6] so it is important to reduce the risk factors for NCD early. World Health Organization (WHO) published a 'Mental Health Global Action Program' and a 'Movement for Global Mental Health' in 2007 [7] . The disease burden for mental illness is estimated to show that the global burden of mental illness accounts for 32.4% of years lived with disability (YLDs) and 13.0% of disability-adjusted lifeyears (DALYs), instead of the earlier estimates suggesting 21.2% of YLDs and 7.1% of DALYs [8] . Effective school health intervention should target preventive measures at primary and secondary levels at an early stage. Health Promoting School (HPS) framework can help to build up effective preventive strategies in school setting. Young people ought to be involved in school and community-based intervention for NCD [9] . Effective school health promotion programs in changing health behaviours are more likely to be complex, multi-factorial and innovative activity in many domains (curriculum, school environment and community) [10, 11] . During the eighties, WHO initiated the concept of HPS moving beyond individual behavioural change to consider organizational structure changes for health improvement covering six key areas: healthy school policies, school physical environment, school social environment, action competencies for healthy living, school health care and promotion services, and community link [12, 13] . Evidence should be gathered extensively about what schools actually do in health promotion using the HPS framework with a detail system of analysis how each individual school has reached the standard of a model HPS [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 265, "end": 268, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 759, "end": 765, "text": "[SARS]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 908, "end": 911, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 982, "end": 986, "text": "(82,", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 987, "end": 990, "text": "930", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1192, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1288, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1497, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1585, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1635, "end": 1638, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1835, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2123, "end": 2126, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2451, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2665, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2669, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3045, "end": 3049, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3050, "end": 3053, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3271, "end": 3275, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3276, "end": 3280, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3281, "end": 3285, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3286, "end": 3290, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3291, "end": 3295, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health Promoting School Framework to Tackle Triple Health Burden"}, {"text": "The HPS model has shaped school health promotion in different parts of the world including the low-income countries [18] . The WHO Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) guidance reiterates that \"every school should be a health promoting school\", and recommends that \"Countries that do not have an institutionalised national school health programme should consider establishing one and countries that do have such programme should continuously improve them to ensure that they align with the evidence base on effective interventions and emerging priorities\" [19] . The English Wessex Healthy School Award Scheme (WHSA) [15] and the Hong Kong Healthy School Awards Scheme (HKHSA) by Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CHEP) [16, 17, 20] have developed detailed systems to analyse whether each individual school has reached the standard of a model HPS, reflecting a more holistic appreciation and understanding of all the effects of school based health promotion with positive award-related changes. The schools will undergo evaluation of the performance and status in relation to the six key areas of HPS adapted from the WHO's guidelines to be considered for award. The evaluative process for HKHSA included reviewing the documentations, conducting interviews with teachers, parents and students as well as observation of school physical and social environment. Schools with HKHSA are recognised in the Healthy School Forum and on the CHEP's website. Data from the pre-and post-surveys of the 962 Primary 4 (P4) students and 1221 Secondary 3 (S3) students in five primary schools and four secondary schools presented to be audited for accreditation of HKHSA after 2 years of implementing the scheme were collected for analysis. Students from the schools which reached certain level of HPS standard as indicated by HKHSA, were compared with students whose schools did not receive the award, and the results showed significant improvement in self-reported health status and academic standings, certain health behaviours as well as satisfaction with life [21] . Primary 4 and Secondary 3 students were chosen to examine the changes for the cumulative impact of HPS at this mid-point of schooling. Another study adopted multi-stage random sampling among schools with awards and those schools not involved in the award scheme nor adopting the concept of HPS (non-HPS). For award group, 5 primary schools and 7 secondary schools were sampled for the study with 510 students and 789 students sampled respectively, and for the 'Non-HPS' group, there were 8 primary schools and 7 secondary schools sampled with 676 students and 725 students sampled respectively [22] . Students of the schools with award were found to be better with statistical significance in personal hygiene practice, knowledge on health and hygiene as well as access to health information [22] . Award schools were found to have better school health policy, higher degrees of community participation, and better hygienic environment [22] . CHEP was commissioned by Quality Education Fund of Hong Kong SAR Government to establish the Thematic Network of HPS aiming to sustain the HPS movement in 2010. The pattern of emotional health of students over years was analysed among 1204 primary 4 and 678 secondary 3 students of 17 primary schools and 5 secondary schools when they first joined the network in 2010. Similarly, to the rationale of previous study [21] , students from those grades were chosen. The self-harm behaviours of students had dropped significantly among schools involved in the CHEP thematic network of HPS [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 120, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 584, "end": 588, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 645, "end": 649, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 803, "end": 807, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 808, "end": 811, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 812, "end": 815, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2136, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2733, "end": 2737, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2931, "end": 2935, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3075, "end": 3079, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3497, "end": 3501, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3666, "end": 3670, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Healthy School Award Scheme to Establish High Quality Standard of HPS: Hong Kong Experience"}, {"text": "There are also numbers of papers analysing the data from the HKHSA as comprehensive system of monitoring and evaluation of performance of HPS [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Cochrane Review of WHO HPS framework for improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement has been conducted [29] . The review was only based on 67 included cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) taken place at the level of school, district or other geographical area. The RCT is not designed for testing organisational or structural change as the statistical assumptions underpinning RCT are not valid reflecting organisational or structural change because of the requirements of RCT such as blinding, randomisation, are needed for drawing statistical inference. Inchley et al. challenged whether HPS initiatives would lead to immediate change at the individual level, so one should study the potential markers of success associated with process [30] . Therefore, updating of HPS through scoping study is needed to identify the indicators of HPS to highlight the ways in which schools have adopted HPS principles successfully under the six key areas: healthy school policies, school physical environment, school social environment, action competencies for healthy living, school health care and promotion services, and community link [12, 13] , and the conditions to be in place to flourish. There is also a need to review the evidence of HPS effectiveness on a boarder perspective dealing with complexity of the school system [31] to link education and health [18, 32] . The following sections report the findings from international forums, review of recent literature, documents and guidelines from international institutions on HPS and child and adolescent health to supplement and substantiate the core indicators and requirements evolved from HKHSA, an established award-scheme framework. The \"Wingspread Consultation\" explored the implications of recent research in the fields of epigenetics, adolescent neurodevelopment and neurobiology on adolescent health. Special journal issue reports the science challenging our thinking to place the individual adolescent within the context of both his/her environment, and within a life course perspective [33] . The linkage of policies and programmes to current understanding of science has added new insights on research on young people's health [34] . Adolescent brain is associated with elevated activation of reward-relevant brain regions, and sensitivity to aversive stimuli may be attenuated [35] . Review of current biological models for addiction highlights the interactive influences of genetic and environmental contributions to addictive behaviours of adolescents supporting the evidence of preventive strategies targeting risk factors and enhancing protective factors at individual, familial and community levels [36] . Greater understanding of the epigenetic mechanism being dynamic in responding to both internal and external environmental stimuli has highlighted the new opportunities for development of early prediction and prevention paradigms with early intervention [33] . These new insights have led WHO to prioritise their interventions addressing the common social determinants of health risk behaviours of adolescents and the importance of the balance of action directed towards the policy and regulatory environment influencing individual behaviours [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 146, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 147, "end": 151, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 152, "end": 156, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 162, "end": 166, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1343, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1347, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1536, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1570, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1574, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2258, "end": 2262, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2404, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2551, "end": 2555, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2878, "end": 2882, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3138, "end": 3142, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3427, "end": 3431, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Healthy School Award Scheme to Establish High Quality Standard of HPS: Hong Kong Experience"}, {"text": "\"Stellenbosch Colloquium\" was attended by 40 experts from 5 continents to share the global and regional experience surrounding HPS with Stellenbosch Consensus Statement [37] .
