A shell vial assay for cytomegalovirus and cytomegalovirus PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens also yielded negative results. Direct fluorescent antibody testing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using the D3TM-DFA Respiratory Virus Screening and ID Kit (Diagnostic Hybrids) failed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenzavirus A and B, and parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, and 3. Likewise, viral bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture using 2 rhesus monkey kidney cell lines, 2 human fibroblast cell lines, and a continuous A549 human alveolar epithelial cell line failed to demonstrate cytopathic effect or hemadsorption, despite incubation for 21 days. After bronchoscopy, the patient became dependent on mechanical ventilation and pressors, and serial chest radiographs revealed persistent bilateral infiltrates (figure 1C). Antimicrobial therapy was changed to moxifloxacin and oseltamivir, and high-dose methylprednisolone therapy was initiated. Results of viral direct fluorescent antibody testing for the 7 respiratory viruses and 14-day viral cultures performed on endotracheal aspirate specimens obtained on days 3 and 4 after hospital admission were negative. Nose swab viral cultures performed on day 5 were also negative.",

Microarray evidence of HPIV-4 was confirmed by PCR of amplified cDNA from the patient's endotracheal aspirate followed by sequencing. Previously published primers [5\u20138] were used to amplify segments of the HPIV-4 genome corresponding to the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and matrix genes. New primer sets were also designed to amplify conserved regions within the genes coding for the fusion protein (RUBULA-F1: 5\u2032-TTGCWGGDGTDGYKRTWGG-3\u2032; RUBULA-R1: 5\u2032-TTTGCWGGDGTDGYKRTWGG-3\u2032) and large protein (PI2-F1: 5\u2032-GAGTAATGAGCATGGTTCAAGGAG-3\u2032; PI2-R1: 5\u2032-CAGGAAGCTTGAGTACATTCACCTA-3\u2032). The RUBULA-F1 and RUBULA-R1 degenerate primers were derived from ClustalW sequence alignment of the fusion genes from parainfluenza 4a, parainfluenza 4b, and mumps viruses, whereas the PI2-F1 and PI2-R1 primers were derived from the sequence of the HPIV-2 large protein gene. Each reaction contained 5.0 \u00b5L of 10\u00d7 PCR buffer (Invitrogen Corporation), 2.0 \u00b5L of 50 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.0 \u00b5L of 10 mmol/L deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 1.0 \u00b5L of forward primer and 1.0 \u00b5L of reverse primer (10 pmol/\u00b5L each), 1 \u00b5L of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation; 5 U/\u00b5L), and 5.0 \u00b5L of template cDNA. Cycling parameters were as follows: 5 min of initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94\u00b0C), annealing (45 s at 50\u00b0C), and elongation (60 s at 72\u00b0C), with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 8 min. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included with each reaction, and amplified PCR bands of the expected size were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Traditional methods of microarray analysis include visual inspection and hierarchical clustering [13, 14]. Visual inspection involves examination of the viral identities of the oligonucleotides with the highest intensities, whereas hierarchical clustering uses a set of microarrays to group oligonucleotides with similar intensity profiles to identify patterns that may correspond to a particular virus. Neither visual inspection nor hierarchical clustering detected a convincing viral signature on the microarray. Thus, we used a new data analysis method, the z-score metric, which has been implemented in our laboratory for identifying weak viral signatures. The z-score metric estimates the statistical significance of individual oligonucleotides on the microarray. Manual inspection of the top 100 viral oligonucleotides ranked by z-score revealed a possible paramyxovirus signature, because 6 paramyxoviridae oligonucleotides were among the top 100 with z-scores ranging from 2.21\u20133.71 (figure 2B, 1\u20136). Four of the oligonucleotides were derived from human parainfluenzavirus 4a, 1 from human parainfluenzavirus 4b, and 1 from simian parainfluenzavirus 5, a close relative of HPIV-4. The 6 oligonucleotides mapped to 4 different regions in the HPIV-4 genome, corresponding to the nucleocapsid protein, phosphoprotein, fusion protein, and large protein (figure 2A and 2B).",

Longitudinal studies in children suggest that human parainfluenzaviruses can be shed from the oropharynx for as long as 3\u20134 weeks [15]. Thus, it is not surprising that we were still able to detect HPIV-4 from a specimen collected on day 4 after hospital admission (which corresponds to \u223c14 days after symptom onset). Nosocomial infection with HPIV-4 is a remote possibility, although a study of patients who received a diagnosis of acute viral pneumonia in the intensive care unit revealed that nearly all of these illnesses (11 [92%] of 12) were community acquired [16]. Moreover, the patient's HPIV-4-specific IgG antibody titer was already elevated at 1: 128 by day 3 after hospital admission, making a nosocomial infection with HPIV-4 extremely unlikely. Despite extensive microbiological testing, no other pathogen was identified in the patient's case. The documented seroconversion that accompanied the clinical infection provides strong additional support that this virus is the etiologic agent for the patient's illness.",

Although serological evidence suggests that HPIV-4 may account for up to 3% of all respiratory tract infections [17], the clinical significance of HPIV-4 in immunocompetent individuals is unknown. Diagnosis of HPIV-4 infection is problematic because HPIV-4 is difficult to isolate in viral cultures, and standard commercial direct fluorescent antibody panels available in most clinical virology laboratories include only HPIV-1, -2, and -3 [18]. In rare instances, HPIV-4 has been shown to cause severe respiratory disease in children [17\u201319] and immunocompromised individuals [20], but hitherto, it has not been associated with acute respiratory failure in healthy, young adults.
