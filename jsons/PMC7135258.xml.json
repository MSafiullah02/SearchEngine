            "text": "Infection control following a biologic agent attack is complex, with some added considerations for the pediatric population. First, early attribution of a cluster of febrile, respiratory illnesses to an intentional biologic agent attack in children might be difficult because children experience respiratory symptoms with common colds more often than adults, and they cannot easily report the subtleties of their own symptoms [7]. Furthermore, strict isolation is complicated in children. Young patients might need to be sedated, especially if isolated in negative pressure tents or rooms. Parents might need to remain with their children in isolation, which can expose them to the infectious agents. In addition, pediatric hospitals need to prepare to care not only for the sick children but also for their parents if separation is to be avoided. Prolonged isolation can dramatically affect children's and parent's well being and their social relations [8]. Pediatric infection control after a bioterrorist event is even further complicated by the fact that there is little consistency in design, structure, organization, and implementation of infection control throughout pediatric facilities in the United States [9]. Unresolved current controversies in pediatric isolation and infection control include the correct application of standard precautions and best precautions to prevent transmission of disease [10]. Four general issues of infection control in pediatrics apply regardless of whether bioterrorism is involved:1.Early recognition and identification of agent2.Notification of public health agencies3.Decontamination, infection control safety measures, isolation, and quarantine4.Treatment, prophylaxis, and vaccination\n",

Decontamination of victims after the release of a biologic agent is less important than during a chemical or radiologic attack because most patients would seek medical care after the incubation period, having decontaminated themselves during this period with showers and clothing changes. In contrast, an announced attack with aerosolized biologic agents would require decontamination. Decontamination with water can cause significant heat loss in children because of their larger surface to body area. Hypothermia can occur without precautions such as the use of warming lights or blankets [4]. Decontamination similar to that recommended after a chemical attack might be necessary [19] Health care professionals who help to decontaminate patients or handle contaminated clothing must wear a gown, gloves, head and shoe covers, and an N95 (disposable) respirator. N-95 respirators are often used in tuberculosis (TB) isolation rooms, in transport of TB cases, or in other areas of the health care facility. When high-risk procedures such as bronchoscopy or necroscopy are conducted, respiratory protection exceeding the CDC standard performance criteria may be needed, such as full face piece negative-pressure respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), or positive-pressure airline-type respirators equipped with a half-mask or full face piece. Contaminated clothing must be placed in biohazard bags to avoid reaerosolization. If necessary, environmental surfaces should be cleaned with a solution of 10% hypochlorite. A 70% alcohol solution can be used after 10 minutes to continue the decontamination.",

Air should pass through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters before being exhausted outdoors [25], [26]. In mass casualty situations, patients should be placed in the same part of the hospital. Access to patients should be restricted to only essential health care professionals and visitors, lest the rest of the institution and its personnel and visitors be contaminated. Patients should only be transported when absolutely indicated, and immediate cleaning and disinfection should follow the patient's path. It is helpful to transport patients in commercially available negative-pressure tents. Pediatric patients might need to be sedated for such transport, for example, from the emergency department to the isolation room, potentially involving anesthesiologists directly.

There is some evidence that vaccinating contacts up to 4 days after exposure to a smallpox patient will either prevent or ameliorate the disease [26], [31].

In the era of routine vaccination, the rate and severity of complications were greatest in children under the age of 5 [35], and the overall mortality rate was 1 per million primary vaccinations [36]. There are reliable data from the 1960s about the incidence and nature of adverse reactions to vaccination, but it may be that the incidence of adverse reactions to a national vaccination program would be higher now because more of the population is immunocompromised, and the incidence of childhood atopy has risen [37], [38]. Elective vaccination is not recommended for certain population groups, although, in the event of an exposure to smallpox, the risks of the vaccination need to be weighed against the risks of clinical disease. In most cases, the patients that are most vulnerable to developing a complication from vaccination are also the patients that would be most at risk for developing smallpox. Thus, there are relative but no absolute vaccination contraindications. The CDC has defined 11 relative contraindications to vaccination (Box 1)\n.Box 1Patients who should not get the smallpox vaccine unless they are exposed to smallpoxaThe following individuals who should not receive smallpox vaccine have or are:1.Eczema, or atopic dermatitis2.Skin conditions such as burns, chicken pox, shingles, impetigo, herpes, severe acne, or psoriasis3.Weakened immune system4.Pregnant5.Allergies to vaccine or its ingredients (polymyxin B, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, neomycin)6.Less than 12 months of age (ACIP recommends <18 years of age)7.Moderate or severe short-term illness8.Breast feeding9.Using steroid drops in their eyes10.A heart condition11.Three or more risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, a first-degree relative who had a heart condition before the age of 50 and who smoke cigarettes\n\na\nData from CDC smallpox fact sheet [CDC web site].

Eleven cases have been reported among the approximately 325,000 primary vaccinees in the military vaccination program, and two cases have been reported among civilians [43]. In addition, there have been five civilian patients with cardiac ischemic events following vaccination. The causal relationship between the cardiac ischemic events and the smallpox vaccination is unclear, but there does appear to be a causal relationship between vaccination and myocarditis. These recent reports of cardiac complications have led the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to revise their recommendations to exclude individuals with known heart disease or three or more cardiac risk factors [44].",

Subsequent work on this genetically modified virus has revealed that vaccinated mice that were also treated with cidovir fared much better than mice that received just the vaccine or just cidovir. Although there are no studies on the efficacy of cidovir on treating smallpox, this drug has been used to treat vaccinia, monkeypox, and mousepox [46].

The treatments available against biologic agents that may be used in a bioterror incident have all been designed for and tested in adults and are often relatively contraindicated in children. Moreover, the usual methods needed to contain a bioterrorism attack are more difficult to implement in a pediatric setting. The vaccines available either have not been recommended or used extensively in children (eg, anthrax) or have been proven to have more adverse effects in very young children (eg, smallpox). Effective infection control measures are more difficult to maintain in a population that psychologically and physically resists isolation measures. In fact, it is very possible that young children will need to be sedated if isolation from parents is necessary, which would require the active role of pediatric intensivists and anesthesiologists.",

Ironically, the success in eliminating infection as the most common cause of pediatric mortality over the last 50 years is that pediatric hospitals are no longer designed for quarantine, which would be required following a bioterrorism attack. Indeed, the difficulties in vaccinating a cadre of health care workers against smallpox were highlighted by the sparse participation of health care workers in the voluntary program initiated by the US government. Several pediatric institutions declined to participate at all and others had minimal participation. Presently, it is prudent to assume that children are extremely vulnerable to bioterrorism attacks and that the pediatric health care system is not fully prepared to deal with bioterrorism.",
