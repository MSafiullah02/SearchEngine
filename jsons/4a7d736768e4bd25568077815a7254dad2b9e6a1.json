Genetic aspects of small populations must be considered at the outset of management programs in order to maximize probability of their long-term survival and continued adaptability. Total genetic variance of a species consists of within population genetic diversity, and the differences found among populations; both types of variance should be maintained to maximize adaptive flexibility of endangered fishes. Forces that erode genetic variation include small population size, population bottlenecks, genetic drift, inbreeding depression, artificial selection in captivity, and mixing of distinct genetic stocks. These can lead to increased homozygosity, loss of quantitative variation, and exposure of deleterious recessive alleles, all of which may reduce fitness. Suggestions for genetically sound management of endangered fishes include genetic monitoring of natural and captive populations, use of large numbers for captive breeding where feasible, selective mating to avoid inbreeding where necessary, minimization of time in captivity, and separate maintenance of distinct stocks.",

These organisms have been intensively studied under natural conditions (Minckley 1973 (Minckley , 1983 Naiman and Soltz 1981; Meffe et al. 1983) , have been reared extensively in captivity for restocking in native habitats (Toney 1974; Hamman 1981 Hamman , 1982a Hamman , 1982b Johnson and Rinne 1982) , and are the objects of large investments of money and manpower. However, the field of endangered fishes management is new and still largely experimental. For example, there is only one hatchery facility for endangered fishes, located at the Dexter National Fish Hatchery (DNFH), New Mexico, established in 1974. Extensive experience in recovery work is generally lacking, and many conservation efforts are by necessity trialand-error attempts at saving a species from immediate extinction, without full regard for long-term prospects of survival.",

Consequently, basic principles were derived from other taxa and from a variety of fields including aquaculture, sport fisheries, animal husbandry, zoo care, and population genetics. Second, there is a decided bias in this work toward southwestern fishes, due to both my own familiarity with that region, and the fact that 61% of U.S. fishes originally listed as endangered are endemic to the southwest (Johnson and Rinne 1982) . Third, this paper is concerned only with genetic aspects of conservation, with no comment on other factors that will have strong bearing on management decisions such as economic, political, or social constraints. I fully recognize that budgetary and facility limitations may severely restrict the extent to which theoretical genetic con-structs may be followed in endangered fishes recovery. I simply present the \"best of all possible worlds\" scenario as a reference guide to sound genetic management, based on our current state of knowledge. It is then up to the individual manager to incorporate the constraints of reality into recovery programs and determine how closely each program can follow recommendations of theory. Finally, this is but a brief synthesis of the rapidly expanding field of conservation genetics. The concerned reader is strongly encouraged to study the more comprehensive works by Soule and Wilcox (1980) , Frankel and Soule (1981) , and especially Schonewald-Cox et al. (1983) .",

Extinction avoidance is the first and obvious goal of any conservation program, and is the most obvious aspect of conservation efforts. However, managers should not be satisfied simply with attainment of this goal. Since all environments ultimately change and will probably change at an ever-increasing rate through man's influence, conservation programs must also maintain the capacity of fishes to genetically adapt (i.e., evolve). This is a long-term goal that is critical to species maintenance in perpetuity (Frankel and Soule 1981) , and is the primary focus of conservation genetics. Finally, the ultimate aim of conservation programs should be the capacity for continued speciation. When confronted with only a few remaining individuals of an endangered species, it may seem ludicrous to be concerned with anything but the immediate salvage of that genome. However, ignoring long-term goals will only postpone the inevitable: extinction of a unique genetic line that is the result of millions of years of continuous evolution. Serious conservation efforts must consider the ultimate, long-term goal of continued evolution. \"The sights [of a conservation program] often are set for the short term, although perpetuity is its ultimate objective. Genetic wildlife conservation makes sense only in terms of an evolutionary time scale. Its sights must reach into the distant future\" (Frankel 1974, p. 54 ).",

This potentially leads to a poorer match of organism to environment, increasing the probability of extinction (Simpson 1953) . Managers of endangered species are presented with remnants of a formerly larger, more diverse gene pool, and are charged with maintaining that pool in the face of continued environmental deterioration. Our major concern should be maintenance of existing genetic variance since evolutionary flexibility is a function of genetic diversity (Fisher 1930; Simpson 1953) . Total genetic variation within a species can be separated into at least two compo-nents (Chambers and Bayless 1983; Hamrick 1983) . First, is variation within individual populations (demes) upon which natural selection acts. If this variation is reduced, there is less of a basis for future selective change (adaptation) within populations. Second, is variation among different populations. Loss of variation at this level results in convergence of populations toward one \"type\" and a narrower range of \"options\" for the species. Both types of variation should be maximized to maintain full potential for evolutionary change within a species.",

The effective pop-2 + 31.6 ulation size of the next generation is thus drastically reduced by disproportionate offspring production.",

Comparison of the following two populations illustrates the importance of fluctuations to Ne. In the first, there are 100 fish for each of 5 consecutive generations, for an arithmetic mean of 100; 1/Ne = 1/5 (1/100 + 1/100 + 1/100 + 1/100 + 1/100) = .01, and Ne = 100. In the second case, the arithmetic mean is also 100, but the population fluctuates each generation as follows: 100, 10, 300, 10, 80; 1/Ne = 1/5 (1/100 + 1/10 + 1/300 + 1/10 + 1/80) = .045, and Ne = 22.

This formula, and the concept of genetic drift, simply represents a chronic bottleneck. However, whereas a bottleneck may do little harm in one generation, a prolonged bottleneck can seriously reduce variance (Fig. 3) . The longer the period of drift, and the smaller the population, the greater will be the loss of variance. For example, only 60% of original variance will remain in a population of 10 after 10 generations. A population of 100 will retain 95% in that time, but if followed for 100 generations (only 100 years in an \"annual\" fish), variance is reduced to 60.6%. For 1000 years this value drops to 0.67%. Clearly, drift can be quite detrimental to long-term genetic health in small populations. Even in the short term, drift can significantly reduce proportion of polymorphic loci (P), average number of alleles per locus (Ma), and average heterozygosity per individual (H). For example, a hatchery stock of Montana west-slope cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki lewisi), derived 14 years earlier from approximately 60 wild individuals, exhibited reductions of 57% (P), 29% (Ma), and 21% (H) compared with the original stock (Allendorf and Phelps 1980) . Other studies of natural (Avise and Selander 1972; Vrijenhoek 1979; Vrijenhoek and Lerman 1982) and captive (Ryman and Stahl 1980; Cross and King 1983; Taniguchi et al. 1983 ) populations of fishes also illustrate the importance of drift.",

Rather, inbreeding results in a predictable increase in homozygous genotypes (Frankel and Soule 1981) differentially affecting different traits. Fitness characters (those related to reproduction, Robertson 1955 ) and others with low heritabilities (Falconer 1981) are most affected by consanguinous matings. Consequently, such traits as fecundity, fertility, age at maturity, clutch size, growth, or survivorship will be greatly depressed by inbreeding (Bowman and Falconer 1960; Wright 1977; Senner 1980) . Data from domesticated animals demonstrate that a AF of 10% will result in a 5-10% decline in individual reproductive traits; if total reproductive performance is considered in aggregate, this may amount to an overall 25% decrease (Frankel and Soul6 1981) . This is an unacceptable level of depression, particularly if it occurs over an extended number of generations. Franklin (1980) and Soule (1980) suggest that a 1% level of inbreeding is tolerable in the short term, amounting to an effective population size of 50. Population sizes in excess of 500 are suggested for the long term. January -February 1986 1 Data on inbreeding effects in fishes are impressive, and include severe body deformities, growth reduction, behavioral changes, and reproductive failures in such forms as convict cichlids, Cichlosoma nigrofasciatum (Winemiller and Taylor 1982) , carp, Cyprinus carpio Wolfarth 1963, ref. in Mrakovcic and Haley 1979) , zebra fish, Brachydanio rerio (Mrakovcic and Haley 1979) , brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (Cooper 1961) , and rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri (Aulstad and Kittleson 1971; Gjerde et al. 1983; Kincaid 1983) .

By relaxing natural selection, or replacing it with random or directional artificial selective forces, the fate of propagated populations may be jeopardized. Assuming that natural selection has already optimized most character states of populations in their particular habitats, any deviation from those states, even those advantageous in captivity, would not be beneficial in nature. \". . . genetically based performance under one set of conditions (i.e., hatchery) may not be correlated with performance under a different set of conditions (stream, lake, natural area). If the goal is to release stock in a different environment from that where they are bred, then the brood stock selection practices must be designed to avoid unconscious selection and inbreeding.\" (FAO/UNEP 1981, p. 25). Frankel and Soule (1981) discuss four types of selection in captivity that can affect genetics: selection for increased productivity, selection for a (perfect) type, selection for tractability, and non-selection. Selection for increased productivity in fishes can occur when the most fecund females are continually used to develop a breeding stock. Although this is most efficient in a propagation program, it can be deleterious in nature, where optimal clutch size is a function of predation risks, growth rates, adult and juvenile mortality schedules, food availability, etc. (Stearns 1976 (Stearns , 1977 . Since increased fecundity may be maladaptive in nature, this type of artificial selection should be avoided.",

With respect to relative fitnesses of hetero-and homozygotes, there exists a \"heterozygosity consensus,\" which is \". . . the belief based on extensive laboratory and farm experience that fitness (variability, vigour, fecundity, fertility, etc.) is enhanced by heterozygosity, and that any decrease in genetic variation will be paralleled by a diminution of fitness\" (Frankel and Soule 1981, p. 48) . Numerous data sets directly or indirectly support the notion that reduction in genetic variance may lower fitness (Wheat et al. 1974; Vrijenhoek and Lerman 1982; Leary et al. 1984 ) and the interested reader is referred to Mitton and Grant (1984, and numerous references therein) for a thorough review. These papers in aggregate demonstrate that increased homozygosity can result in at least slower growth, reduced survivorship, and developmental instability. Perhaps the most striking example of effects of homozygosity is in the South African cheetah (Acinonyx j. jubatus), which has a paucity of genetic variance at over 200 structural loci and the major histo-compatibility complex, apparently due to a severe bottleneck (O'Brien et al. 1985) . These animals have great difficulty breeding in captivity, high rates of juvenile mortality in wild and captive populations, and an abnormally high susceptibility to an epizootic coronavirus, all attributed to genetic uniformity.",

Spatially isolated populations of organisms, with little to no gene flow among them, will tend to genetically diverge either through different selective forces or random drift (Endler 1977) ; in its extreme form, this leads to speciation. Any isolated population of fishes is a potentially unique gene pool with characteristics that may differ from all other demes. This is particularly evident in salmonids, which demonstrate the potential for extensive genetic divergence of fish stocks (Donaldson 1971; Busack et al. 1979; Stahl 1981 Stahl , 1983 . Consequently, in cases where endangered fishes exist in more than one natural population, we have at our disposal a powerful management tool: the potential existence of genetically distinct groups with which to recover the species. This is not a trivial observation, for it allows the manager flexibility in building breeding stocks, reintroduction to field sites, and other management actions. For example, if an endangered fish retains viable populations in both constant springs and fluctuating streams (e.g., Vrijenhoek et al. 1985) , the manager has a choice of which gene pool to use for propagation, whether to combine fish from both, or which gene pool to use for stocking a new field site. Natural populations can be kept genetically isolated, mixed and isolated captive stocks can be developed, and gene pools used for introduction can be better matched to the environment. It is therefore critical that variance among naturally isolated populations, however subtle, be preserved and exploited through continued isolation wherever possible.",

This occurs when genes from one deme, which are closely linked and \"coadapted\" to work well with one another, are broken up by hybridization into gene complexes that do not function together as well. It is quite common, for example, for first generation hybrids to be robust, but then to lose fitness over subsequent generations, presumably as coadapted gene complexes are broken up (Roughgarden 1979) . Evidence for such \"outbreeding depression\" is provided by Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky (1958) in fruitflies, Alstad and Edmunds (1983) in pineleaf scale insects, and Stahl (1981) in Atlantic salmon (salmo salar). Rasmuson (1981) pointed out the need for further understanding of the importance of outcrossing to locally adapted gene complexes in fishes. At present, it appears that the potential exists for fitness reductions in fishes due to loss of coadapted gene complexes.",

If this continues for several generations, or if the forces are strong, the practice has the potential of selecting for a common hatchery stock and thus eliminating between-stock variation.

Perhaps the most important step toward sound genetic management is collection of data on popu- lation structure and genetic and morphological variation (Allendorf and Phelps 1981; Ryman 1981; Hamrick 1983 ). Without these data, we can only make blind decisions regarding preservation of genetic variation. This was recognized in the FAO/UNEP report of 1981 (p. 11), which stated \"A good knowledge of the population structure in the management of fisheries cannot be exaggerated . . . Only when stocks are properly defined can the fishery be managed optimally.\" They also emphasized (p. 11) that \"When re-introduction of a locally extinct population is contemplated, earlier baseline information might allow a closer matching of the introduced fish to the original population. Proper genetic matching would increase the likelihood of successful re-introduction ... Other things being equal, populations of maximum electrophoretic variation should be selected for introduction because this probably increases the likelihood of evolutionary adaptation to a novel environment.\" Useful information for such attempts would derive from electrophoretic and chromosomal analyses, and morphometric and meristic studies designed to obtain estimates of available intraand inter-population variation. Present examples include work on western trouts (Behnke 1970 (Behnke , 1979 , pupfishes (Turner 1973a (Turner , 1973b (Turner , 1974 (Turner , 1984 , and the Sonoran topminnow (Vrijenhoek et al., 1985) . Detailed genetic analyses should be conducted on any endangered fish to determine how variation is distributed within the species and how best to preserve that variation (as per Chambers and Bayless 1983; Loveless and Hamrick 1984) . In the case of aquatic organisms, it is convenient to partition genetic variance into that contained within localities, between localities within drainage systems, and between drainage systems (Chambers 1980) . Vrijenhoek et al. (1985) conducted such an analysis on the endangered Sonoran topminnow (Poeciliopsis occidentalis) and found total genetic variation in the species to be composed of diversity within localities (21%), between localities within drainages (26%) and between three major genetic groups, equivalent to subspecies (53%). This analysis indicates it is vital to preserve representatives of all three groups, and of somewhat lesser importance (although not unimportant) to maintain multiple populations within groups. Only when armed with such knowledge can the manager make informed decisions with respect to preservation of genetic resources.",

As a result, the \"basic rule of conservation genetics\" (Soule 1980) is that a genetically effective population size of 50 is the minimum requirement for short-term survival (on the order of several generations). This number will result in a 1% AF per generation, which is tolerable for several generations. For long-term genetic health, Franklin (1980) suggests a minimum Ne of at least 500, with an associated inbreeding coefficient of 0.1% and a low rate of genetic drift. Of course, larger populations than this are desirable. Ne in any case may be maximized by maintaining equal sex ratios of breeding adults, insuring even progeny distribution by individual breeding and culling of excess offspring (Frankel and Soul! 1981) , and avoiding population crashes. Such action will minimize further erosion of quantitative genetic variation through bottlenecks or drift, and will reduce loss of rare alleles and inbreeding effects. These problems can also be countered by periodic introduction of wild individuals (from the same locality as the original brood stock) into the captive population.",

Periodic replacement of hatchery fish with those from natural populations is also advised to prevent possible adaptations of fish to hatchery conditions; these adaptations may not be advantageous in natural environments.\" Separate stocks of isolated populations (Table 1) will maximize inter-population variance, maintaining potentially distinct forms and thereby allowing greatest flexibility in management. For example, if a particular field locality is to be stocked with an endangered fish, we have the option of selecting from among several stock populations, and can choose the one whose habitat of origin most closely matches the new site. By not mixing wild populations, we retain the option of experimentally combining portions of these demes in the future, should adverse effects of small populations appear; if initially combined, however, the populations cannot later be separated.",

For example, the Devil's Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis, Cyprinodontidae) has apparently existed for thousands of generations with populations hovering near several hundred individuals (Miller 1948) . Classical genetic models predict that continual inbreeding should probably have already led to extinction of this species, yet it still thrives in its single locality. The point here is that, although our current knowledge of conservation genetics is incomplete and perhaps inaccurate in some cases, it is the best information presently available. Even if strict adherence to these basic principles proves unnecessary in particular cases, it is a conservative approach to species maintenance since it inevitably maximizes remaining genetic variation. The task of endangered species maintenance in perpetuity is admittedly difficult but there are few alternatives if we wish to conserve fishes for more than a few generations. The genetic dangers faced by any small population appear to be great; the costs of ignoring this fact may be even greater.",
