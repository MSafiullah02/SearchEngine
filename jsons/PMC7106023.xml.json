Scorpion envenomations along with other insect bites are common in Arizona and can be a cause of drooling and increased secretions. This was at the top of the differential upon evaluation and the need for emergent intubation. Scorpion envenomation often presents with respiratory distress along with increased drooling, abnormal eye movements, muscle twitching, and agitation. The patient did have respiratory distress, drooling, and ptosis of his eyes, but no abnormal eye movements were appreciated. Additionally, the patient initially presented without respiratory distress and progressed, which is not characteristic of envenomation. Grading and treatment of scorpion envenomation (Table 1\n) are based on location of pain, location of paresthesia, cranial nerve involvement (oral secretions, blurry vision, tongue fasciculations, nystagmus), and skeletal neuromuscular dysfunction (abnormal movements or flailing of the extremities).1\n",

Croup is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms including stridor, barking cough, or hoarseness. A neck radiograph will show the traditional narrowing of the trachea known as a steeple sign.3 However, a radiograph is not routinely performed for diagnosis because croup is usually a clinical diagnosis.

The most common muscular dystrophies in children are Duchene and Becker. Both are X-linked recessive and caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene which clinically presents with progressive weakness.5 Weakness often affects proximal limb muscles before distal, and lower extremities before upper extremities. The classic finding is Gowers sign, where a child uses their hands and arms to walk up their body to get to an upright position from sitting because of the lack of hip and thigh muscle strength.5 Physical examination findings include pseudohypertrophy of the calf, lumbar lordosis, waddling gait, shortening Achilles tendon, hypotonia, and hyporeflexia.5 The patient did not have any secondary symptoms of the above, and the patient had a normal gait. Polymyositis, on the other hand, is a rare autoimmune myopathy with direct T-cell invasion of the muscle fibers.6 The hallmark of this disease is weakness, primarily proximal muscle weakness. Lastly, myasthenia gravis is an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease that affects postsynaptic neuromuscular junction.7 Usually, symptoms are gradual, but patients can present in myasthenic crisis leading to respiratory failure. Most common symptoms include ptosis and diplopia which are worse with activity and improved with rest. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition defined by worsening weakness and requires noninvasive ventilation or intubation.8\n",

He was sedated but had clear and equal breath sounds bilaterally. His heart had a regular rate and rhythm, and he had good perfusion throughout. No abnormal physical examination findings were found. His orogastric tube was set to low intermittent suction, and he remained on a dexmedetomidine drip at 0.4 \u03bcg/kg/h and ampicillin/sulbactam 50 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours pending culture results. A CT of the neck was obtained to rule out other etiologies for respiratory distress, which was negative for peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. An extubation trial was done on day 2 of admission. Because of inspiratory stridor and increased work of breathing, he was given inhaled dexamethasone and racemic epinephrine with minimal improvement. He continued with poor pharyngeal tone, drooling, dysarthria, and hypoxia with oxygen saturations 80%, and he was reintubated for airway protection. During extubation, the patient was moving all his extremities, but there was concern for hypotonia. The patient was on sedating medications, which were a confounding factor. Neurology was consulted at that time because of concern for a neuromuscular process. Their recommendations included to obtain negative inspiratory force studies, magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumber spine with gadolinium contrast, acetylcholine receptor antibody, ganglioside (GM1, GD1b, GQ1b) antibodies, lumbar puncture with standard indices plus cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IgG, oligoclonal bands, IgG/albumin ratio, IgG index, and electromyography. CSF studies were normal with WBC 0, RBC 0, protein 19, and glucose 97. CSF West Nile Ab IgG and IgM were negative. CSF oligoclonal bands were negative, and the patient had a normal IgG to albumin ratio. A comprehensive drug screen was negative. Negative inspiratory force was reported at \u221240. Electromyography with 2-Hz repetitive stimulation was abnormal, which showed a greater than 10% decrement for the left deltoid/axillary, left tibialis anterior/peroneal, and left adduction digiti minimi/ulnar. Ganglioside (GM1, GD1b, GQ1b) IgG and IgM antibodies were negative. Initial acetylcholine binding and block antibodies were negative, but positive for acetylcholine receptor muscle binding (0.15 nmol/L, normal <0.02), negative striated muscle Ab titer, and AchR muscle modeling Ab 17%, therefore 17% loss of Ach receptor.

Once disabling and often fatal, myasthenia gravis can be managed effectively with therapies that include anticholinesterase agents, rapid immunomodulatory therapies, chronic immunosuppressive agents, and thymectomy. Treatment varies based on the age of the patient, severity of disease, respiratory involvement, bulbar involvement, and progression of the disease. Goals of treatment are to minimize adverse effects of the drug while having improvement in symptoms and return to baseline function. Symptomatic treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibition increases the amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thereby improving symptoms. Pyridostigmine is often the treatment of choice and sometimes is used as monotherapy. With generalized myasthenia gravis, steroids and nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents are used to target immune dysregulation. Likewise, plasma exchange or IVIG is an immunomodulating treatment used for bridge therapy or during acute exacerbations of myasthenia gravis. Approximately 15% of patients with myasthenia gravis are found to have a thymoma. Surgery with complete resection is indicated for these patients when possible.",
