            "text": "Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the host cell receptor for infection of SARS-CoV [7]. The S protein of this virus was shown to be sufficient for the binding to this receptor molecule [8], [9]. ACE2 is expressed in many tissues, including epithelia of the lung and small intestine [10], [11]. Indeed, pathological characterization of several autopsied tissues from SARS-CoV-infected individuals also revealed viral signals only in the restricted tissues such as lung and small intestine [11], [12]. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-infected ileal and colonic mucosa appeared normal at the microscopic level and no viral inclusion bodies could be detected in the intestinal biopsies obtained from a SARS patient [13] or in fatal cases of SARS [14]. Recent examination of seven ACE2-positive cell lines of human intestinal origin for SARS-CoV infection revealed that only one cell line (LoVo) was sensitive to infection without CPE [15]. This culture seems to accord with the histopathologic findings in intestinal samples from patients [13], [14]. In sharp contrast to the LoVo cell line, the Vero E6 cell line undergoes a lytic infection with characteristic refractile rounding CPE [16], [17] that seem to correspond to the features of multinucleated pneumocytes resulting from local replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of patients [11], [12].",

Murine CoVs, especially mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), induce hepatitis, enteritis, and encephalitis in mice. The pathogenic effects vary with the virus strain, route of infection, and the strain, age, and immune status of the host mice [18], [19], [20]. Persistent infection of MHV can be established in immunosuppressed or neonatal animals [21], [22], [23], [24]. Also, MHV causes both lytic and persistent infections in a variety of murine cultured cell lines and in these persistent infections, the cells produce virus variants with defective or aberrant phenotypes [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. On the other hand, human CoVs such as 229E and OC43 are also responsible not only for common colds [32], [33] but also pneumonia, meningitis, diarrhea [34], [35], as well as central nervous disorders [36], [37]. Persistent infections of these human CoVs can be established in human neuronal cell lines [38], [39].",

After the production of the progeny particles, the host cells die via an apoptotic mechanism [40], [41]. This host cell killing in the acute phase seems to be the typical course for this virus. In this study, we examined the possible establishment of persistent infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. The results showed that Vero E6 could survive the acute infection with SARS-CoV, and the survivor cells allowed long-term persistence of this virus, although serial continuous passages resulted in a gradual decrease of the viral RNA-positive cell population. Upon cell cloning of the persistently infected cell population, only 1 out of 87 cell clones obtained was a long-term producer of infectious virus particles at a high rate, with aberrant expression of S protein.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, most of the Vero E6 cells were viral antigen-positive on the 1st and 2nd days. The cells that did not undergo rounding on day 3 were also viral antigen-positive, although only a fraction of the cells were positive: 70.8%, 67.4%, 45.0%, 39.0%, 39.4%, and 39.5% on days 1\u20136, respectively. By co-staining with Hoechst 33258, it was found that most of such surviving cells with expression of viral antigens contained no apparent apoptotic bodies inside them (Fig. 2). Next, the culture supernatants harvested daily from the infected Vero E6 cells were subjected to infectivity titration and also to antigen-capture ELISA using anti-SARS-CoV guinea-pig PAb and murine (2G3) MAb, as shown by TCID50 per ml and absorption at 492 nm, respectively (Fig. 3\n). The viral production rate was the highest (107.5 TCID50 per ml) on days 2\u20133 (Fig. 3A). After the cells were replaced in fresh medium on day 3, the surviving cells also continued to produce infectious virus particles at a high rate, near 107 TCID50 per ml (Fig. 3A). A similar particle production pattern was also observed by antigen-capture ELISA (Fig. 3B). The guinea-pig PAb recognizes SARS-CoV proteins, including S and N proteins (as described below), whereas murine 2G3 MAb recognizes the SARS-CoV S protein (data not shown). Thus, these surviving, viral antigen-positive Vero E6 cells were shown to be persistently infected with SARS-CoV, so this cell population was named Vero/SARS-CoV. The Vero/SARS-CoV cells came to show a similar morphology and cell proliferation rate as the parental Vero E6 cells upon subsequent continuous passaging of the cells. However, the percentage of the cells positive for SARS-CoV antigens gradually decreased to ~10% by 5 months after infection.",

On the other hand, there was no apparent difference in virus replication rate of the SARS-CoV from #21 cells, compared with that of the SARS-CoV from acutely infected Vero E6 cells, in both Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells (Fig. 8\n). The Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells were similarly infected at an MOI of 1 with SARS-CoV in the culture fluid of acutely infected Vero E6 cells and that in the culture fluid of #21 cells. The RNA extracted from the infected cells on days 0 (just after adsorption) and 10 were analyzed for viral genomic RNA levels by RT-PCR using primers at 1ab region. The results showed that the amounts of PCR products on day 10 samples were almost similar between SARS-CoV at acute and persistent phases, although those on day 0 samples were apparently higher in the SARS-CoV at acute phase than that at persistent phase in both Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. Thus, the adsorption rate may be different between SARS-CoV prepared at acute and persistent phases, but the subsequent replication rate of the virus from persistent phase was almost similar to that from acute phase.",

Next, Western blotting was also carried out to confirm the differences in the expression of viral proteins among the same acutely infected Vero E6 cells, Vero/SARS-CoV, and #21 (Fig. 9B). The cell fractions as well as the virus particle fractions precipitated from the culture media by ultracentrifugation were characterized. Western blotting using the cell fractions and guinea-pig anti-SARS-CoV PAb revealed lower amounts of S protein in Vero/SARS-CoV and #21 compared with that in acutely infected cells. However, the amounts of N protein in Vero/SARS-CoV and #21 cells were similar to that in the acutely infected cells. Similarly, rabbit PAb to the N-terminus region of SARS-CoV S protein also detected a higher amount of the S protein in the acutely infected cells than those in #21. Rabbit PAb to the C-terminus region of SARS-CoV N protein detected the N protein in the acutely infected cells and Vero/SARS-CoV and a rather lower amount of N proteins in #21. The S/N ratios by triplicate experiments using rabbit anti-S and anti-N PAbs were 0.81 \u00b1 8.080 in the acutely infected cells and 0.059 \u00b1 0.014 in the Vero/SARS-CoV. In the virus particle fractions, a lower amount of S protein in #21 was detected compared with that in acute infection, but an only slightly lower amount of N protein in #21 was detected compared with that in acute infection.

            "text": "The viral expression in cell clone #21 was shown to be different with regard to the S to N ratio from that in acutely infected Vero E6 cells. This different S/N ratio was also similarly observed in uncloned, parental persistently SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, suggesting the universality of this difference in persistently infected Vero E6 cells. Similar observations have been reported for other CoVs: a number of MHV variants with deletions in the S glycoprotein have been isolated from persistently MHV-infected animals; however, the significance of generating and potentially accumulating deletion variants in the persistent viral population remains unclear, although it has been proposed that the complexity of the population of persisting viral RNAs may contribute to chronic disease [49], [50]. Interestingly, the cultured cells persistently infected with MHV were shown to be resistant to superinfection with MHV but not to infection with other unrelated viruses [51]. When the culturing of cells persistently infected with MHV was carried out for >400 passages, the yield of released virus gradually decreased and only ~10% of the cells were viral antigen-positive at passage 97 [51], which was similar to the pattern we observed for SARS-CoV in this study. In the case of MHV persistence, if fewer than 100 cells were subcultured, then the persistent infection ended and the resulting cultures no longer produced virus and became susceptible to MHV infection [51]. In contrast, we were able to obtain several virus-positive cell clones by culturing a single Vero/SARS-CoV cell in the wells of 96-well microplates. In human neuronal cell lines persistently infected with human CoV OC43 and 229E, there were no important common viral-genome mutations related to the persistent infection [38], [39]. On the other hand, using bovine CoV it was found that a translation-attenuating intraleader open reading frame was selected in this virus mRNA during persistent infection [52], [53]. In this study, we found that the persistently infected cells maintained the expression of SARS-CoV antigens for at least 5 months during maintenance without cell cloning, while most of the cell clones prepared from Vero/SARS-CoV cells were negative for virus RNA by RT-PCR. Several cell clones positive for virus RNA at early passages after the preparation also readily shifted to become negative, suggesting that a certain host cell factor(s) may be involved in the maintenance of SARS-CoV in the Vero E6 cells during the uncloned condition. In addition, such host factor, probably together with other factor(s), may be also involved in a long-term maintenance of SARS-CoV even in the cloned condition such as in #21. It is noteworthy that the SARS-CoV S to N ratio in persistently infected cells was significantly lower than that in acutely infected cells. Electron microscopic observation also supported this conclusion, as shown by the much lower density of the \u201cknob\u201d structures in persistently than acutely infected Vero E6 cells. In fact, we identified a total of 5 nucleotide substitutions at S gene, but no substitution at N gene in the viral RNA from #21 cell clone. However, we found no apparent difference in the replication rates in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells between SARS-CoV prepared from acutely and persistently infected Vero E6 cells. We will need further studies to clarify the correlation between the S/N ratio and the establishment of persistent infection with this virus.",

Another report showed that conventional serological tests such as IF, Western blotting, and ELISA using serum samples from patients with SARS that were obtained 7\u201335 days after the onset of fever detected specific IgG reactions in at most 89% of them [55]. However, on the basis of Western blotting using sera obtained from a total of 43 patients with SARS that were obtained 7\u201335 days after the onset of fever, most (79%) of the patients produced antibodies to N protein, but only 40% produced antibodies to S protein [55]. A similar estimate (83.3%) was also obtained in another study, although 25.0% had not produced antibodies to SARS-CoV by day 21, and 16.7% had not produced viral antibodies even by day 60 [56]. Thus, in a considerable number of cases it seems to be difficult to detect specific antibody responses to SARS-CoV, suggesting the possibility that such infected individuals may readily allow the virus to establish a persistent infection.",

            "text": "Pathological characterization of several autopsied tissues from SARS-CoV-infected individuals revealed viral signals mostly in the lung and small intestine, but not in lymphoid organs such as spleen and lymph nodes [11], [12]. Thus, lymphocytes might be resistant to SARS-CoV infection in vivo. Nevertheless, evidence of SARS-CoV infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was reported. RT-PCR is a relatively rapid and sensitive method for the diagnosis of patients with SARS symptoms using patient-derived samples such as nasopharyngeal aspirates [57], [58]. One trial to standardize the sample source for quantification of SARS-CoV used plasma and PBMC derived from patients at three SARS stages: days 1\u20137, 13\u201339, and 79\u201391 after fever onset [59]. The viral RNA was detectable even in PBMC, where its level was higher than that in plasma at all clinical stages. The peak of the shedding of SARS-CoV corresponded to the peak of the course of SARS-CoV infection. Surprisingly, residual SARS-CoV may persist in a patient's circulation, in most cases for a relatively long time without obvious effects on the host. The viral loads in the plasma were not significantly different in the samples obtained at days 13\u201339 and 79\u201391. Thus, some cells, including PBMC, may be a reservoir for this virus, although the pathophysiologic significance of such persistently infected cells is not clear yet. In addition, the recent finding that dendritic cells can take up SARS-CoV and transfer it to susceptible target cells seems to be important, since such dendritic cells may serve as a reservoir that might provide long-term exposure to this virus and contribute to the persistence and chronicity of infection [9]. The above observations, together with the fact that other CoVs readily establish persistent infections in vivo and in vitro, and also together with our establishment of persistent infection in the Vero E6 cell line after induction of severe CPE, suggest that complete elimination of SARS-CoV from all patients who have recovered from SARS seems to be unlikely. The pathophysiologic significance of such long-lasting persistent infection with SARS-CoV in vivo, if any, should be clarified in further studies.",
