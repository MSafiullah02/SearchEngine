We screened symptomatic adult transplant recipients for respiratory viruses in a cohort of patients attending a referral medical center in Brazil. The duration of viral shedding and the prevalence of viral codetections were also determined. During a 1-year period (2011-2012), swabs were obtained from 50 patients. An in-house polymerase chain reaction panel designed to detect 10 viruses was used. Viruses were identified in 19 (38%) patients, particularly parainfluenza III (32%) and the respiratory syncytial virus (20%); multiple viruses were identified in 26% of patients. Prolonged viral shedding was observed with 60% of individuals excreting viruses for >10 days. The clinical and epidemiologic relevance of prolonged viral shedding remains to be determined.",

Transplant patients could be infected by the same respiratory viruses that affect the overall population, including adenovirus (ADV), human bocavirus (hBOV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (2) . However, because of the state of immunosuppression, the rate of disease complication may be increased in the transplant population. The duration of viral shedding is an important determinant of viral infectivity and transmissibility; factors that provide vital information for effective infection control (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . In the transplant population, limited data are available regarding the duration of viral shedding following a respiratory tract infection.

To compare the distribution of respiratory viruses infecting the overall Respiratory viruses were detected in 19 patients (38.0%), mostly in fall and winter months. Multiple viruses were identified in 5 individuals (26.3%), including 1 patient who had 3 viruses detected. The most prevalent virus was PIV III (32%), followed by RSV (20%), hBOV (12%), hMPV (12%), pH1N1 (8%), ADV (8%), FluA (4%), and FluB (4%). The viral distribution differed from what was observed for the overall population, in which RSV was the predominant agent (54.5%). The prevalence of viral codetection in the general population was 35%, with 5 patients in the group showing concomitantly 4 respiratory viruses. Table 2 presented the duration of viral shedding per patient studied. Viral shedding ranged from 6 days (hBOV; n = 1) to 44 days (hMPV; n = 1). The average duration of viral shedding was 10 days for pH1N1 (n = 2), 17 days for PIV III (n = 3), and 13 days for RSV (n = 3). (11) . Recent studies reported a frequency of 21.4% and 10% of dual respiratory viral infection in children with bronchiolitis after molecular assays were added to the diagnostic list of clinical laboratories (12, 13) . Therefore, when using modern and sensitive methods, such as real-time PCR, in the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections, even higher rates of viral codetection are anticipated to be found in the transplant setting (11) . As shown before (11) , the detection of multiple respiratory viruses in transplant recipients was not associated with a poor prognosis in these patients. In our study, PIV III was the most frequent virus detected in transplant patients (31.6%), followed by RSV (20%), hBOV (12%), hMPV (12%), pH1N1 (8%), and ADV (8%). In previous investigations, using conventional diagnostic methods (i.e., direct immunofluorescence and viral culture), the incidence of PIV III infection following transplantation varied from 2-9% (4, 14) . On the other hand, studies based on PCR revealed a higher frequency of PIV III infection, as high as 14.0% (4). In contrast to transplant patients, in whom PIV III was the predominant virus, RSV was the main cause of respiratory infections in the non-transplant population (54.5%), referred to the same hospital. The high RSV frequency detected in non-transplant patients suggests that most of these patients were probably children, which is in accordance with the literature that suggests that RSV is one of the most common causes of severe lower respiratory disease in young children (15) . Human rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are frequently associated with the common cold and are generally considered to replicate principally within the upper respiratory tract (16) . Despite the high frequency of these viruses in the population, the real importance of these agents in the transplant population remains to be determined (16) .",

Even though a previous study showed prolonged hBOV shedding in non-transplant children (7), only 1 patient with hBOV infection was included in our study, and therefore, we were not able to properly evaluate hBOV shedding in our transplant cohort. The current data on pH1N1 shedding are in agreement with a previous report, which suggested that the presence of pH1N1 was a significant risk factor for prolonged viral shedding (median of 27 days) (8) .",

Because viral shedding is prolonged in these patients (as demonstrated by the current study), this criterion could have reduced the number of patients enrolled in our study (9) .

Because of this fact, we could have missed some patients with mild to no symptoms, which could affect the estimated duration of shedding.",
