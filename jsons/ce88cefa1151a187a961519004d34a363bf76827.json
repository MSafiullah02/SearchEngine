            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV) encephalitis is endemic in Bangladesh, with yearly seasonal outbreaks occurring since 2003. NiV has a notable case fatality rate, 75-100 per cent depending on the strain. In Bangladesh, primary transmission to humans is believed to be because of consumption of bat-contaminated date palm sap (DPS). Both the disease and the virus have been investigated extensively, however efforts to implement preventive strategies have met social and cultural challenges. Here we present a variety of community approaches to control the spread of Nipah encephalitis, along with advantages and disadvantages of each. This information may be useful to health workers and policymakers in potential NiV outbreak areas in Southeast Asia.",

            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging infectious disease (EID) and belongs to the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae). First identified and isolated in the village of Sungai Nipah, Malaysia in 1999 during a severe disease outbreak in humans and pigs, NiV was initially diagnosed as a Hendra-like virus and named 'Nipah'. 1 During this outbreak the virus was isolated from multiple species, including humans, horses, dogs, cats, cattle, and rats. 2, 3 Clinical symptoms in humans occurred in those with direct contact with pigs. Further investigation found that Malaysian outbreaks had begun in September 1998 and lasted until April 1999, resulting in 105 human deaths and culling of 1.1 million pigs. 3 In Western Bangladesh, NiV was first identified in April/May 2001 in an encephalitic outbreak with high case fatality (9 out of 13). 4 A second outbreak in Bangladesh occurred in January 2003, during which 8 people died (out of 12). 4 Traceback information suggested two risk factors: climbing date palm trees and close association with patients. 5 In 2004, 49 deaths (out of 65 cases) were reported in a third outbreak in two separate communities. 4 It was found to be a result of direct or indirect contact with fruit bats, including date palm sap (DPS) consumption. 6 During a subsequent outbreak in 2005, researchers established a significant relationship between the consumption of raw date farm syrup contaminated by fruit bat saliva and NiV infection (11 out of 12 cases died). 4 Between 2001 and 2012, 280 cases of Nipah or Nipah-like virus encephalitis were identified, with 211 deaths (case fatality rate of 75 per cent). 7 NiV appears to be increasingly virulent in Bangladesh, with greater case fatality rates each year, peaking at 100 per cent in 2011 and 2012. Recently, bats have been vectors in many EIDs, including speculation that the current Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa could be because of a spillover from bats. 8 Blum et al (2009), Homaira et al (2010) and more recently Gurley and colleagues (2015) , analyzed the social conditions associated with the spread of NiV. They studied key stakeholders, operating beliefs, and scientific message responses. [9] [10] [11] For knowledge translation and transference to occur, all these authors suggest that appropriate communication and community engagement is needed. In their absence, potential interventions are unlikely to be considered acceptable and adhered to by at risk community members.",

A separate study of nosocomial transmission of Nipah encephalitis found no risk to health-care workers. 14 ",

Bamboo skirting effectively reduces sap contamination by fruit bats. Sap harvesters consider it cost-effective and acceptable. 21, 22 Boiling the sap is less attractive to harvesters, as they believe it changes the taste and consistency of the drink, although it disables the virus. A report by the New York Times mentioned a government ban on the sale of raw DPS during the 2011 outbreak, suggesting a movement toward stricter prevention protocols, although they are difficult to enforce. 23 In addition, a surveillance system has been implemented in five hospitals in the NiV belt to detect outbreaks early. 24 As there are no treatment options other than supportive care, nor a vaccine for people or animals, the government currently focuses on prevention by increasing public awareness. They use newspaper advertisements, talk shows, and discussions on local TV and radio. Educational programming airs before and during each Nipah virus season (November-May). 25 The International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh in collaboration with Stanford University, is conducting trials in the districts of Rajbari and Natore. They want to compare the effectiveness of advising people not to drink raw DPS versus drinking sap only from trees protected by skirts to prevent DPS from contamination by bats. The results from the first phase of the study are due December 2015. 26 ",
