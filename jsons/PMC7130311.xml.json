On January 24, 2020, Huang et al10 reported in The Lancet on the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics, as well as treatment and outcomes, of the virus. An understanding of the clinical features will help clinicians to recognize the infected patients and minimize the risk of exposure to others. It was inferred that the target cells might be in the lower airway, due to features of presentation such as the lack of prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms and the ground-glass opacities on chest CT images. Older male subjects with comorbidities have been reported to have more severe and even fatal respiratory diseases.11 Additional studies will help in assessing for host risk factors for disease severity and mortality. Laboratory evaluation has found lymphopenia in 63% of patients and a cytokine storm profile in those who are critically ill. The combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response may have an impact on the severity of illness, similar to what has been proven in SARS and MERS.10 Translational research may discover biomarkers and other cofactor triggers in infected patients with different risk stratification.",

In this social media era, when an epidemic occurs, a great deal of misinformation is readily available.24 Hopefully, the early suggestion that COVID-19 infection is of lower lethality than SARS holds true. In contrast, a low health threat on the individual level means there is potential to cause disruptions of global public health systems and a long duration of person-to-person transmissibility. Mild illnesses and asymptomatic carriers may be potential sources of infection, sustaining a local epidemic and global spread. To reduce panic and economic loss, and to manage and save the infected, much remains to be done. The goal is to break the transmission chain of COVID-19. This will require effective programs to trace, diagnose, and cure every infected patient.
