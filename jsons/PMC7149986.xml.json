            "text": "The history and development of infectious disease genomics are closely associated with the Human Genome Project (HGP).1 A series of important discussions about the HGP were made from 1985 to 1986,1, 2 which led to the appointment of a special National Research Council (NRC) committee by the National Academy of Sciences to address the needs and concerns, such as its impact, leadership, and funding sources. The committee recommended that the United States begin the HGP in 1988.3 They emphasized the need for technological improvements in the efficiency of gene mapping, sequencing, and data analysis capabilities. In order to understand potential functions of human genes through comparative sequence analyses, they also advised that the HGP must not be restricted to the human genome and should include model organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm. In the meantime, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) of the US Congress also issued a similar report to support the HGP.4 In 1990, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) jointly presented an initial 5-year plan for the HGP.5 In October 1993, the Sanger Center/Institute (Hinxton, UK) was officially open to join the HGP. The cost of DNA sequencing was about $2 to $5 per base in 1990 and the initial aim was to reduce the costs to less than $0.50 per base before large-scale sequencing.5 The sequencing cost gradually declined during the subsequent years. In 2004, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) challenged scientists to achieve a $100,000 human genome (3 Gb/haploid genome) by 2009 and a $1000 genome by 2014 to meet the need of genomic medicine. In early 2014, Illumina announced that the company would begin producing a new system to deliver full coverage human genomes for less than $1,000.6\n",

Along with the development of the HGP, there was exponential growth of the number of completely sequenced free-living organism genomes. The Fungal Genome Initiative (FGI)14 was established in 2000 to accelerate the slow pace of fungal genome sequencing since the report of the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996.15 One of the major interests was to sequence organisms that are important in human-health and commercial activities. With the explosion in the number of sequenced genomes, thanks to the development of next generation\u2013sequencing methods, many genome-based studies have become popular. Compared to 6 years ago when only 1100 completed genome projects were documented, the GOLD (Genomes OnLine Database) contains information for 67,879 genome-sequencing projects, of which 7210 were completed, as of August 2015.16, 17\n",

            "text": "The genomes of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its major mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae were published in 2002.18, 19 Historically, the effort to sequence the malaria genome began in 1996 by taking advantage of a clone derived from laboratory-adapted strain.20 Notably, many parasites have complex life cycles that involve both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts and are difficult to maintain in the laboratory. Few other important human pathogenic parasites, such as trypanosomes,21, 22\nLeishmania,23 and schistosomes, 24, 25 have been either completely or partially sequenced.26, 27 In the meantime, the genome sequence of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for yellow fever and dengue fever, was published in 2007.28 The genome size (1376 Mb) of this mosquito vector is about 5 times larger than the previously sequenced genome of the malaria vector A. gambiae. About 50% of the genome consists of transposable elements. In 2010, the genome sequence of the body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus), an obligatory parasite of humans and the main vector of epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis), and trench fever (Bartonella quintana), was reported.29 Its 108 Mb genome is the smallest among the known insect genomes. Subsequently, more vector genomes have been published.30, 31, 32 Genome-sequencing projects for other important human disease vectors are in progress.33, 34 These include Culex pipiens (mosquito vector of West Nile virus), and Ixodes scapularis (tick vector of Lyme disease, Babesia and Anaplasma). The challenge to sequence the genome of an insect vector is much greater than a microbe. For example, the genome of ticks was estimated to be between 1 and 7 Gb and may have a significant proportion of repetitive DNA sequences, which may be a problem for genome assembly.35 Furthermore, the evolutionary distances among insect species may also affect homology-based gene predictions.",

Eventually, five antigens were chosen as the vaccine components based on a series of criteria including the ability of candidates to be expressed in Escherichia coli as recombinant proteins (350 candidates), the confirmation of surface exposure by immunological analyses, the ability of induced protective antibodies in experimental animals (28 candidates), and the conservation of antigens within a panel of diverse meningococcal strains, primarily the disease-associated MenB strains.55, 58, 59 The vaccine formulation consists of an fHBP-GNA2091 fusion protein, a GNA2132-GNA1030 fusion protein, NadA, and OMVs from the New Zealand MeNZB vaccine strain, which contains the immunogenic PorA. Initial phase II clinical results in adults and infants showed that this vaccine could induce a protective immune response against three diverse MenB strains in 89\u201396% of subjects following three vaccinations and 93\u2013100% after four vaccinations.59 This vaccine (Bexsero) has been approved in the USA and in more than 30 other countries.60\n",

Among 10,000 actinomycetes, only 278 strains were confirmed to have pepM by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening and genome sequencing. A diverse collection of phosphonate biosynthetic gene clusters were identified within these strains. Remarkably, 55 out of the 64 distinct clusters would direct the synthesis of unknown compounds. Characterization of strains within five of these groups resulted in discovery of argolaphos, and other interesting compounds, including valinophos, and phosphonocystoximate.

Platensimycin did not have cross-resistance to other antibiotic-resistant strains in vitro, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. No toxicity was observed using a cultured human cell line and the activity of platensimycin was not affected by the presence of human serum in this study. However, the FAS II system appears to be dispensable for another Gram-positive bacterium, Streptococcus agalactiae, when exogenous fatty acids are available, such as in human serum.65, 76 The susceptibility to inhibitors targeting the FAS II system indicates heterogeneity in fatty acid synthesis or in acquiring exogenous fatty acids among Gram-positive pathogens.76 Comparative genomic approaches may be useful to identify and develop a strategy to target the salvage pathway for S. agalactiae. Alternatively, similar approaches as described earlier for MenB vaccine may also be applied for S. agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus).77\n",

The finding of artemisinin-resistant malaria in Cambodia and GMSR raised a concern regarding the global spread of these parasites. While a number of studies, including population genetics and laboratory-based investigations were conducted, no reliable molecular marker was identified until the major breakthrough reported in early 2014.78 Clinical artemisinin resistance has been defined as a reduction of parasite-clearance rate, which is expressed as an increase of parasite-clearance half-life, or a persistence of microscopically detectable parasites 3 days after artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Although artemisinin was thought to have broad-stage specificity against malaria throughout the life cycle, it was showed that artemisinin-resistant parasites only had decrease of artemisinin susceptibility at ring stages, which was demonstrated by the ring-stage survival assay (RSA0\u20133 h).79\n",

Eight mutations in seven genes were eventually selected from the result based on whole-genome sequence analysis F32-ART5 and F32-TEM (its sibling clone cultured without artemisinin) at 460\u00d7 and 500\u00d7 average nucleotide coverage, respectively. To examine whether these in vitro selected mutations were associated with artemisinin resistance in Cambodia, sequence polymorphism in all seven genes were analyzed from 49 culture-adapted clinical isolates related to their RSA0\u20133 h. Only polymorphisms of a gene, K13-propeller, showed a significant association with RSA0\u20133 h survival rates. In total, four mutant alleles, each harboring a single nonsynonymous SNP (Y493H, R539T, I543T, and C580Y) within a kelch repeat of the C-terminal K13-propeller domain were identified. To confirm that K13-propeller polymorphism is a molecular marker of clinical artemisinin resistance, parasite-clearance half-lives in patients were correlated with their K13 alleles. Of the 150 patients, 72 carried parasites with a wild-type allele and the others carried parasites with only one of the three single nonsynonymous SNPs in the K13-propeller: C580Y (n = 51), R539T (n = 6), and Y493H (n = 21). The parasite-clearance half-life in patients with wild-type parasites is significantly shorter (median 3.30 h) than those with these three mutant alleles (median 6.28\u20137.19 h). Subsequently, clinical studies have validated the association between K13 propeller mutations and artemisinin resistance.80, 81, 82\n",

The computational search for conservation was performed across all known viral families. A microarray hybridized with a reaction derived from a viral isolate cultivated from a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) patient revealed that the strongest hybridizing array elements belong to families Astroviridae and Coronaviridae. Alignment of the oligonucleotide probes having the highest signals showed that all four hybridizing oligonucleotides from the Astroviridae and one oligonucleotide from avian infectious bronchitis virus, an avian coronavirus, shared a core consensus motif spanning 33 nucleotides. Interestingly, it had been known previously through bioinformatics analyses that this sequence is present in the 3\u2032 UTR of all astroviruses, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and an equine rhinovirus.103 Therefore, a new member of the coronavirus was identified through the unique hybridizing pattern and subsequent confirmations.",

MCV is the etiological agent of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), which is a rare but aggressive skin cancer of neuroendocrine origin. Two cDNA libraries derived from MCC tumors were subjected to high-throughput sequencing by a next-generation Roche/454 sequencer. Nearly 400,000 sequence reads were generated. The majority (99.4%) of the sequences derived from human origin were removed from further analyses. Only one of the remaining 2395 cDNA was homologous to the T antigen of two known polyomaviruses. One additional cDNA was subsequently identified to be part of the MCV sequence when the complete viral sequence was known. Later analyses showed that 80% (8/10) of the MCC had integrated MCV in the human genome. Monoclonal viral integration was revealed by the patterns of Southern blot analysis. Only 8\u201316% of control tissues had low copy number of MCV infection.",

H. nana eggs and Blastocystis hominis cysts were found in stool. The disease progressed to death despite antiparasitic and antiretroviral treatment. Histological examination of biopsied lymph nodes revealed proliferative cells with overt malignant features. They were monomorphic with morphologic features characteristic of stem cells (a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio). However, the small cell size (<10) suggested infection with an unfamiliar, possibly unicellular, eukaryotic organism. Infection with a plasmodial slime mold rather than H. nana was considered because of the prominent syncytia formation and the primitive appearance of the atypical cells but lack of architecture identifiable as tapeworm tissue. PCR screening suggested that these cells were H. nana. Next generation\u2013genome sequencing and comparative analysis revealed H. nana variants harboring mutations typically found in cancer.",
