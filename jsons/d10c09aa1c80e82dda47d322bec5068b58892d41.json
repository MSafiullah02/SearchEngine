We assessed the relationship between aggregated mobility data collected from mobile phone users and the time-dependent reproduction number R(t), using severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases reported by S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We found that the proportion of 5 individuals staying home all day (isolation index) had a strong inverse correlation with R(t) (rho<-0.7) and was predictive of COVID-19 transmissibility (p<0.0001). Furthermore, indexs of 46.7% had the highest accuracy (93.9%) to predict R(t) below one. This metric can be monitored in real time to assess adherence to social distancing measures and predict their effectiveness for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 10 One Sentence Summary: Mobility data to monitoring social distancing in the COVID-19 outbreak",

To reduce the peak of transmission, starting in March of 2020, the Brazilian states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de 10 Janeiro in Brazil, with a population of 63 million people, implemented non-pharmacological interventions and recommended social distancing measures. This implied reductions in public gatherings; the closure of schools, universities, and businesses such as restaurants, bars and gyms; and the institution of remote or virtual work for older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions. In light of these public health interventions only essential 15 services (i.e., grocery stores, emergency health service) remained open. To prevent the expansion of COVID-19 epidemic, the non-pharmacological measures have to bring the time-dependent reproduction number (R(t)) to less than 1. This requires a 50-60% reduction of a baseline R(t) between 2 and 2.5 (2) . 20",

Although R(t) is a useful tool to monitor the epidemic, it is subject to significant delays in notification. In Brazil, a time lag of 8 days exists between the date of onset of symptoms and the 25 date of notification of a SARI case(8). Given this time, relying solely on the measurement of R(t) bears a likely risk of introducing significant delays in detecting changes in the epidemic dynamics. In an epidemic with cases doubling in 5.2 days(9), a delay of 1-2 weeks in the implementation of effective social distancing would overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare system, resulting in a growing number of excess deaths(10-13). Thus, a timelier metric for 30 COVID-19 transmission potential is required to evaluate social distancing interventions.",

            "text": "The structural impacts of social distancing should also be considered while managing its impact on disease transmission and, consequently, the healthcare systems' capacity. A previous analysis demonstrated that social distancing adopted during the Spanish flu pandemic was associated with better economic outcomes (24) . However, society dynamics have changed dramatically during 10 the past 102 years, and a continued monitorization of the COVID-19 socioeconomic impact is urgently needed. Suboptimal interventions for COVID-19 could be potentially catastrophic to public health and lead to a significant number of deaths. Thus, finding the optimal \"therapeutic dosage\" of such interventions is crucial, and requires a reliable and timely tool to monitor its effects. 15 R(t) depends on the contact-rate among individuals; but the frequency of these contacts is difficult to quantify in real time through conventional approaches (25) . We observed an inverse relationship between R(t) and the isolation index for S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro States, the two mostly affected by the epidemic. We find that increases in the isolation index from lower 20 than 25% to greater than 50% have lead to a reduction of R(t) from approximately 2 to values less than 1, such as we observed. Highly-effective social distancing could reduce COVID-19 transmission enough to make a strategy based on contact tracing feasible, as is taking place in South Korea and Singapore (26, 27) . 25 By using the R(t) values associated with isolation indexs above 50%, we simulated social distancing interventions with varying time extensions. In most scenarios, interventions lasting between 30 to 60 days would blunt the first epidemic wave, although a shorter intervention led to a quick rebound and was not sufficient in scenarios with higher values of R(t) during the intervention. Lower values of R(t) resulted in a more effective control during the first wave, but 30 with a caveat that the second epidemic wave was became significantly larger (albeit smaller than the initial peak that would have been otherwise seen in the absence of interventions). Furthermore, the delay in this peak allows the preparation of healthcare systems to mitigate health impacts by securing equipment and supplies, bolstering ICU capacity, planning for personnel needs and implementing infection control policies. 35",

Although it is tempting to propose that social distancing interventions that would lead to an R(t) value of 1.1, such a strategy could have potentially catastrophic consequences. The reason for 40 this is that values of social indexs below 50% are associated with a mean R(t) value of 1.4 (ranging from 0.7 to 2.6), which was not significantly different from no intervention. Aiming at achieving a R(t) value of 1.1 by lowering the social isolation index could therefore lead to a scenario similar to the natural history of COVID-19. It is thus more effective and probably safer to set a goal of R(t) below 1 and implement social distancing interventions that lead to social 45 isolation indexs above 50%.

However, it is possible that different cities will have non synchronized COVID-19 epidemics, hence interventions will need to be tailored for each city or metropolitan area individually.

However, we used SIVEP-GRIPE data, a stable and a well- 30 established system and recommendations for its use have not changed during the epidemic, we believe that this is the most reliable and consistent source of data for severe cases of COVID-19 in Brazil.

To our knowledge, no study thus far has assessed the 35 use of mobile phones for this purpose in Brazil. Monitoring human activity through mobile aggregated data can permit measurement of the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing transmissibility of the SARS-CoV2 virus(18). Nonetheless, the association between urban mobility and COVID-19 transmissibility has not yet been established. In this study, we assessed the relationship between social isolation measures, by using human urban movement 40 data and the transmissibility of COVID-19.Fig. 1A and 1D). Most SARI cases in SP and RJ have not been tested due to the shortage of SARS-CoV2 real-time polymerase cycle reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic screening. In 2019, 5",
