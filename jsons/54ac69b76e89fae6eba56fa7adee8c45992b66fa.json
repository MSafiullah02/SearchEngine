Patients should be evaluated with attention to findings consistent with malaria as well as additional and/or alternative causes of presenting symptoms. Of primary importance in the treatment of malaria is the provision of prompt, effective therapy and concurrent supportive care to manage lifethreatening complications of the disease. Supportive measures, such as fluid management, oxygen, ventilatory support, cardiac monitoring, and pulse oximetry, should be instituted as needed. During this time, intravenous access should be obtained immediately. Point-of-care testing can be used for rapid determination of hematocrit, glucose, and lactate. Parasitemia can also be determined quickly but requires a microscope. Additional tests can be done if/when indicated: electrolytes, full blood count, type and cross, blood culture, and clotting studies. Unconscious patients should have a lumbar puncture to rule out concomitant bacterial meningitis in the absence of contraindications (i.e., papilledema). These tasks should overlap with an institution of antimalarial treatment as well as other ancillary therapies as needed (including anticonvulsants, intravenous glucose and fluids, antipyretics, antibiotics, and blood transfusion) [11, 12] .",

The bacterial infection should be suspected in patients with severe anemia together with signs or symptoms of sepsis (hypotension, cold extremities, delayed capillary refill, hyperlactatemia). In such cases, blood cultures should be obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with activity against gram-negative bacilli should be initiated [24, 25] .",

Species identification and quantification are complicated, however, with this technique and, therefore, thick and thin blood film examination is still required. This technique requires the use of expensive fluorescent microscopy equipment for the inter-pretation of results. This is a significant limitation especially in the poor resource countries [25] .",

However, regimens used to treat chloroquine-resistant infections may also be used if available. Note that if treating P vivax or P. ovale infections, primaquine or tafenoquine (after quantitative testing to rule out G6PD deficiency) should also be given k Primaquine and tafenoquine kill any dormant hypnozoites in the liver, thus prevent relapses of P. vivax and P. ovale infections. Because primaquine and tafenoquine can cause hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient persons, quantitative G6PD testing must occur prior to starting treatment with these drugs. For persons with borderline G6PD deficiency, primaquine may be given 45 mgorally one time per week for 8 weeks; consultation with an expert in infectious disease and/or tropical medicine is advised if this alternative regimen is considered in G6PD-deficient persons l Primaquine and tafenoquine must not be used during pregnancy. Pregnant patients with P. vivax and P. ovale infections should be maintained on chloroquine prophylaxis for the duration of their pregnancy. The chemoprophylactic dose of chloroquine phosphate is 300 mg base (= 500 mg salt) orally once per week. After delivery, pregnant patients who do not have G6PD deficiency should be treated with primaquine or tafenoquine. Primaquine can be used during breastfeeding if the infant is found to have normal G6PD levels. Tafenoquine is not recommended in breastfeeding women m Note: There are three options (A, B, or C) available for treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. vivax. High treatment failure rates due to chloroquine-resistant P. vivax have been well documented in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Rare case reports of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax have also been documented in Burma (Myanmar), India, and Central and South America. Persons acquiring P. vivax infections outside of Papua New Guinea or Indonesia should be started on chloroquine. If the patient does not respond, the treatment should be changed to a chloroquine-resistant P. vivax regimen and CDC should be notified (Malaria Hotline number listed above). For treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax a positive blood smear OR history of recent possible exposure and no other recognized pathology who have one or more of the following clinical criteria (impaired consciousness/ coma, severe normocytic anemia, renal failure, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, circulatory shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, spontaneous bleeding, acidosis, hemoglobinuria, jaundice, repeated generalized convulsions, and/or parasitemia of > 5%) are considered to have manifestations of more severe disease. The parasite density can be estimated from the percentage of infected RBCs by examining the thin smear slide under oil immersion magnification where the RBCs are more or less touching (approximately 400 RBCs per field), and should be monitored every 12 h. Severe malaria is most often caused by P. falciparum o All patients with severe malaria should be treated with IV artesunate. Call CDC for IV artesunate p Exchange transfusion is no longer recommended based on a systematic review of the literature and analysis of US malaria surveillance data showing no added benefit in severe malaria",
