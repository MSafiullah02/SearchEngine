Capitalist hosts who are able to afford to cover their expenses for the duration of the crisis, may choose to remain in the short-term market. Other capitalist hosts will opt for long-term rentals due to their relative stability to ensure their expenses will be covered. This transition has already occurred during COVID19 (Calatayud, 2020; Carson, 2020; Derwin, 2020). The befrienders and the ethicists will keep their rooms unoccupied for a few months, then recommence welcoming guests.",

As short-term renting became financially more attractive, the proportion of investors increased. Between 2015 and 2016, 81% of Airbnb's revenue in the USA was generated by hosts with multiple listings (CBRE Hotels America Research, 2017). The number of instantly bookable spaces with no vetting by the host increased from 1 to 3.6 million from 2017 to 2019 (Alltherooms, 2020). This, along with the rise of commercial intermediaries managing properties for third parties, suggests that Airbnb was shifting away from its original philosophy, becoming primarily a commercial space trading platform (O'Neill & Ouyang, 2016). We hypothesize that the COVID19-induced super-shock will lead to a re-emergence of the original Airbnb ethos.",

Over time, more people embraced Airbnb, leading to an exponential growth in listings. In 2020, Airbnb listed 6.1 million spaces; a growth of 39% since 2018 (Alltherooms, 2020). The assumption of continuing growth (Oskam & Boswijk, 2016) and the myth of 30\u201350% higher rental yields (Hometime, 2020) attracted investors aiming to maximize profit or pay off the mortgage on an investment property (Airbnb, 2015; Clever Real Estate, 2019; Gottlieb, 2013). Yet, just before the pandemic, growth began to slow (Alltherooms, 2020), suggesting that, in the absence of COVID19, Airbnb listing numbers would have slowly plateaued.",
