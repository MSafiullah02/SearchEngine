Existing sentiment-tosentiment transfer models ignore the valuable sentiment-specific details already present in the text. We address this issue by providing a simple framework for encoding sentiment-specific information in the target sentence while preserving the content information. This is done by incorporating sentiment based loss in the back-translation based style transfer. Extensive experiments over the Yelp dataset show that the Sen-tiInc outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a margin of as large as \u223c11% in G-score. The results also demonstrate that our model produces sentiment-accurate and information-preserved sentences.",

However, in many style transfer tasks such as sentiment-to-sentiment transfer, such data is not readily available. Therefore, most of the recent work in language style transfer focuses on solving this task in an unsupervised setting [2, 6] . Unsupervised learning involves learning a latent representation of data in a shared latent space, which provides fine control over the latent attributes in the data. Autoencoders have been used for generating sentences with controllable attributes by the disentangled latent representations [1, 4] . Most of the work done previously on the task uses adversarial training for learning this latent representation [3, 4, 12, 18] .",
