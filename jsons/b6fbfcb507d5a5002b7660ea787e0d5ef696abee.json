            "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia are a global public health priority, and prevention has been highlighted as a pivotal component in managing the dementia epidemic. Modifiable risk factors of dementia and AD include lifestyle-related factors, vascular and metabolic disorders, and psychosocial factors. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are needed to clarify whether modifying such factors can prevent or postpone cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. Given the complex, multifactorial, and heterogeneous nature of lateonset AD and dementia, interventions targeting several risk factors and mechanisms simultaneously may be required for optimal preventive effects. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) is the first large, long-term RCT to demonstrate that a multidomain lifestyle-based intervention ameliorating vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors can preserve cognitive functioning and reduce the risk of cognitive decline among older adults at increased risk of dementia. To investigate the multidomain intervention in other populations and diverse cultural and geographical settings, the World-Wide FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) network was recently launched (https:// alz.org/wwfingers). Within this network, new FINGER-type trials with shared core methodology, but local culture and context-specific adaptations, will be conducted in several countries. The WW-FINGERS initiative facilitates international collaborations, provides a platform for testing multidomain strategies to prevent cognitive impairment and dementia, and aims at generating high-quality scientific evidence to support public health and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the WW-FINGERS network can support the implementation of preventive strategies and translation of research findings into practice.",

Driven by population aging, this number is expected to increase rapidly to over 150 million by 2050, creating a major public health and social challenge (2). Alzheimer's disease (AD) underlies the majority of dementia cases, often in association with vascular neuropathology. Disease-modifying therapies are not yet available for AD, and despite the recent positive signals in some of the ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing anti-amyloid compounds, drug trials have mostly reported disappointing results (3, 4) . Given the evidence emerging from longitudinal observational studies, indicating that late-life cognitive impairment, AD, and dementia are heterogeneous and multifactorial conditions driven by a combination of genetic, vascular, metabolic, and lifestyle-related factors, the potential of dementia prevention through risk factor modification and management has gained increasing attention.",

            "text": "Findings from observational studies need to be substantiated by RCTs, which are considered the gold standard to verify the effect of an intervention. Results of the earlier, smaller, shorter-term prevention RCTs focusing on individual lifestyle components and risk factors have been mostly modest, and evidence from large, long-term trials is only beginning to emerge (5) . Importantly, in light of the current knowledge about the complex and multifactorial etiology of late-onset AD and dementia, targeting several risk factors and mechanisms simultaneously, as well as tailoring interventions to individual risk profiles, may be necessary to obtain optimal preventive effects. So far, three large European multidomain lifestyle-based prevention trials have been completed: the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) (6) , the French Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) (7) , and the Dutch Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (PreDIVA) (8) . The FINGER trial reported significant beneficial intervention effects on the primary outcome, namely change in global cognitive performance, among older 'at risk' adults from the general population (6) . Notably, exploratory subgroup analyses of MAPT and PreDIVA also suggested cognitive benefits in subpopulations of participants with increased risk of dementia (7) (8) (9) . Taken together, these studies indicate that administering multidomain lifestyle-based interventions to older at-risk adults may be feasible and effective. However, to fully understand the potential and impact of multidomain preventive interventions, their efficacy and feasibility needs to be explored in diverse populations and contexts worldwide. The FINGER model is now tested and adapted in several new preventive trials globally, and the World-Wide-FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) network (https://alz.org/wwfingers) was launched to support these joint initiatives aiming to reduce the burden of cognitive impairment and dementia. This article will provide an up-to-date overview of the multidomain intervention concept, lessons learned from the recent multidomain RCTs, and future directions in the field.",

These include vascular and metabolic risk factors and disorders, lifestylerelated, and psychosocial factors. It is also common that neurodegenerative and vascular pathology co-occur, particularly in older adults with dementia, and mixed dementia has been reported to be the most common type of dementia among individuals older than 80 years (12, 13) . With regard to several vascular risk factors, the association with dementia risk is modified by age, and different risk factors may be relevant at different time points in life (14) . For example, hypertension, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia in mid-life are risk factors for lateonset dementia and AD (15) , but the opposite association has been reported later in life and in studies with shorter follow-up times, possibly reflecting reverse-causality (i.e., those factors decrease in the early, asymptomatic stages of dementia most likely as a consequence of the disease) (16, 17) . In addition to vascular and metabolic factors (high blood pressure and cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism), smoking (18) , excessive use of alcohol (19) , depression (20) , as well as other psychosocial factors, such as workrelated stress, feelings of hopelessness or loneliness, and infrequent social contacts (21) (22) (23) , are associated with an increased dementia risk. Protective factors for cognitive impairment, dementia and AD include regular physical activity (24) , having a higher formal education (25) and an intellectually demanding and stimulating work (occupational complexity) (26) , as well as engaging in cognitively and mentally stimulating leisure activities (27) . Social engagement and having a rich social network have also been associated with a reduced risk of dementia and AD (28, 29) .",

This indicates clearly a prevention potential across the lifespan. In line with these findings, secular trend studies have indicated that the age-specific incidence and prevalence of dementia may have declined in some Western countries (39) , potentially as a result of improved treatment of cardiovascular disease and vascular risk factors, reduction in smoking, increased educational attainment, and an overall improvement in lifestyle. However, the prevalence of dementia has been shown to increase faster than expected in countries like China and Japan (40, 41) , and with increasing prevalence of some risk factors, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (42) , there is a great need for global efforts to manage risk factors and reduce the burden of dementia.",

            "text": "A key issue to consider in preventive interventions is the fact that multiple risk and protective factors for dementia and AD usually co-occur and interact across the lifespan to determine the individual's overall risk of dementia. For instance, in the context of interactions between genetic and environmental factors, it has been reported that the harmful effects of unhealthy lifestyle (i.e., unhealthy diet, alcohol misuse, smoking, physical inactivity) may be more pronounced among carriers of apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele, which is the most well-known genetic risk factor of late-onset AD (43) . Furthermore, vascular factors can have additive effects (10) . Overall, co-occurrence of risk factors, as well as their time-and age-dependent effects, underline the complexity of dementia prevention and imply that a \"one-size-fits-all\" preventive approach might not be effective. Instead, a tailored, life-course approach targeting multiple risk factors is likely needed for effective prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia. This means that middle-aged and older adults, as well as individuals with heterogeneous risk profiles, may benefit from somewhat different multidomain preventive strategies in order to change their risk profiles.",

Targeting at-risk individuals (as opposed to an unselected population) is likely the most feasible strategy. Second, the FINGER trial demonstrated the importance of starting early enough: the prevention potential of a multidomain lifestyle intervention, especially if not combined with pharmacological treatments, may be highest among relatively healthy and younger old adults. Finally, the content of the intervention is crucial. The intervention may need to be intensive enough and preferably include also active counseling and coaching delivered in different ways (not only advice). Based on the content and duration of the intervention sessions and study visits, the FINGER intervention was the most intensive, and the participants attended both group and individual sessions. Despite the relatively intensive nature of the intervention, adherence was high, as approximately 72% of the participants reported at least some engagement in all intervention components. Thus, the FINGER multidomain intervention seemed feasible, pragmatic, and not too strenuous. Designing and adapting the content of the intervention for various target populations is essential to optimize the effect. Finally, the choice of an appropriate outcome measure to assess intervention effects is also important. Incidence of dementia is a robust outcome, and trials with such outcome would require a large sample size and long-term follow-up, especially when targeting cognitively healthy older adults. For this population, there is currently no gold standard measure to detect cognitive changes predictive of future dementia. However, composite cognitive scores capturing several cognitive domains may be useful (52) , not only to detect early changes typical for AD, but also for vascular cognitive impairment, since both disorders often co-occur in advanced age.",

One example of an Internet-based eHealth study is the Healthy Aging Through Internet Counselling in the Elderly (HATICE, ISRCTN48151589), which is a European 18-month RCT testing the efficacy of an Internet platform in improving self-management of cardiovascular risk factors for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline (53) . The trial enrolled 2724 non-demented, computer literate community-dwellers aged 65+ from Finland, France, and the Netherlands. Participants were required to have at least two cardiovascular risk factors and/or history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Participants were randomized 1:1 to intervention and control groups. The intervention group had access to an interactive Internet platform, designed to encourage lifestyle changes with the remote support of a lifestyle coach, according to national and European guidelines for cardiovascular risk factor management (54) . The control platform included only basic health information and no interactive features or coach support. The trial has been completed, and data analysis is ongoing. If the delivery of preventive interventions through Internet or e.g. via mobile applications proved to be feasible and effective and induced sustained behavioral changes, it could support self-management and be a cost-effective way to reach and involve a large population across the world.",

            "text": "While the FINGER, MAPT, and PreDIVA trials targeted older adults from the general population, some new multidomain prevention studies focus on at-risk populations in clinical settings. One particularly relevant target population for multidomain prevention are individuals with prodromal AD. For this more advanced and symptomatic state of AD dementia risk, lifestyle and vascular changes alone may not be sufficient. Rather, a combination of lifestyle and pharmacological approaches may be necessary to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. There are currently no proven therapeutic options available for such individuals, but in the multinational European LipiDiDiet trial (NTR1705) (55), the effects of the medical food product Fortasyn Connect (Souvenaid) were investigated in 311 memory clinic patients with prodromal AD, as defined by the International Working Group (IWG)-1 research criteria (56) . Fortasyn Connect is a mixture of multiple nutrients, such as vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and phospholipids, which improves the formation and function of synapses (57) . The primary outcome of the LipiDiDiet trial was change in cognitive performance measured with an NTB composite score. Secondary outcomes included change in e.g. memory scores, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and brain volume. The two-year core trial was completed in 2015. Despite no significant effect on the primary outcome, group differences in favor of the treatment group were observed for cognitive and functional outcomes (45% less worsening in the CDR-SB in the intervention group), and hippocampal atrophy (26% less deterioration in the intervention group) (55) . Notably, the observed decline in the NTB in the control group was smaller than expected. Analyses of the intervention effects at 36 months will be completed soon. This initiative supports and coordinates other trials worldwide in testing the feasibility and efficacy of FINGER-type preventive interventions in different at-risk populations, across diverse geographical and cultural settings. All WW-FINGERS trials share the same key concept of a pragmatic multidomain approach, i.e. targeting several modifiable risk factors simultaneously. WW-FINGERS will facilitate data sharing and joint analysis across studies, and to ensure comparability of the results and to facilitate pooling of accumulating data, the trials aim to use common core outcome measures. At the same time, local and cultural adaptations will be applied in relation to the content and delivery method of the intervention. For example, dietary counseling will follow national recommendations while taking into account country-or region-specific habits, and pharmacological vascular risk factor management, when applicable, will be based on national care guidelines. This is essential to improve engagement and adherence, and subsequently, to facilitate the effective and sustainable implementation of preventive strategies. Several countries worldwide have joined the WW-FINGERS network and are currently at different stages of planning and conducting their FINGER-type prevention trials (Figure 1 ). Recruitment is already ongoing in several trials.",

It is a two-year trial targeting 2000 older adults aged 60-79 years with normal cognition but increased risk for future cognitive decline. The trial will compare two lifestyle-based interventions (structured vs self-guided lifestyle intervention), which vary in their intensity and structure. Another ongoing trial testing the FINGER-based model is the randomized controlled Multimodal INtervention to delay Dementia and disability in rural China (MIND-CHINA), aiming at recruiting up to 3500 older adults aged 60-79 years who are living in rural areas of the Shandong province. The MIND-CHINA trial uses cluster randomization by village and includes two intervention arms and a control arm. Due to high prevalence of untreated vascular risk factors in this population, the trial will focus on the management and treatment of these factors. Participants in the vascular intervention group will be provided with pharmacological control and management of three major vascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes); the multidomain intervention group will have both the management of the vascular risk factors and a multidomain lifestyle intervention. In the lifestyle intervention, special emphasis will be placed on reducing salt intake, which is a key dietary challenge in China. In Singapore, the six-month feasibility study SINGapore GERiatric intervention study to reduce physical frailty and cognitive decline (SINGER) targeting 70 participants with mild/moderate frailty and/or cognitive impairment is ongoing. The two-year study AUstralian-Multidomain Approach to Reduce Dementia Risk by PrOtecting Brain Health with Lifestyle intervention (AU-ARROW) is currently planned in Australia. Another Australian multidomain prevention trial, the ongoing three-year Maintain Your Brain (MYB) trial, is associated with WW-FINGERS (study design and outcomes not fully harmonized with other WW-FINGERS studies). The MYB RCT randomized 6236 non-demented communitydwellers aged 55-77 years. Assessments and interventions are conducted online, and the multidomain eHealth intervention consists of exercise, cognitive training, dietary advice, guidance to stop smoking and reduce alcohol consumption, blood pressure and cholesterol management, and cognitive behavior therapy to manage depressive symptoms and to facilitate social interaction.",

Yet, the majority of the observational studies on risk and protective factors have been conducted in high-income countries, with few findings available from low-and middle-income countries, which are facing the highest rise in dementia prevalence and incidence. In fact, by 2050, 68 % of all people with dementia worldwide are expected to live in low-and middle-income countries (1).

Importantly, it offers prevention potential on a large scale, with possibilities for worldwide implementation. Country-specific adaptations will be crucial to ensure effective implementation of multidomain preventive interventions in different cultural, geographical, and economical settings, as well as public health care systems. Introduction of innovative eHealth and mHealth tools can facilitate implementation and monitoring of the interventions, while reducing costs and reaching larger regions and populations. The proportion of older adults using Internet is increasing, supporting the use of eHealth-based approaches, but feasibility is a key issue and is actively investigated.
