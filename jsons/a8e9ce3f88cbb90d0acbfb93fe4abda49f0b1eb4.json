Job stress was the most significant factor affecting ICNs' turnover intention. To reduce ICNs' turnover intention, their task stress needs to be lowered and managed. In particular, efforts should be made to establish a relation-oriented organizational culture that values positive relationships while enhancing their community spirit at the organization level.",

            "text": "Recently, medical institutions have experienced a serious shortage of nursing staff internationally, and the turnover of professional nurses has become a threat to providing high-quality medical services. 1 In particular, because infection control nurses (ICNs) are professionals with significant clinical experience and qualifications, reducing their turnover is essential for effective human-resource management. 1 In 2015, when the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak occurred in South Korea, the number of professionals performing infection-control tasks increased rapidly, with the revision of medical law related to infection control in 2016. 2, 3 ICNs experience stress from their roles as professional nurses, excessive work load, and the lack of personnel and other support from nursing organizations. 4, 5 These reasons may cause ICNs' turnover intention, which in turn may bring about actual turnover, resulting in their career discontinuation. 1, 2 Turnover intention ranges between thoughts of leaving and the action of leaving, and is considered the most important variable preceding actual turnover. 6 Turnover intention is affected by organizational factors such as job stress, various types of organizational culture, and leadership, 7,8 as well as by personal factors such as demographic characteristics. 1 Organizational culture includes relation-oriented culture, innovation-oriented culture, task-oriented culture, and hierarchy-oriented culture. 8 A relation-oriented culture focuses on human relationships and values such as trust, participation through teamwork, loyalty, and morale. 8 An innovation-oriented culture values organizational change and inventiveness with a focus on patients' satisfaction, and recognizes creativity and entrepreneurship as central values. 8 A task-oriented culture emphasizes productivity in achieving organizational performance and carrying out tasks and values external orientation and stability. 8 A hierarchy-oriented culture emphasizes stability, but also order and procedure among members of the organization. 8 This study aimed to understand the nursing organizational culture and job stress created by ICNs working together, affected turnover intention, and the general characteristics influencing it. Another aim of this study was to identify the current status of turnover intention of the rapidly increasing number of ICNs, and provide basic data for the efficient management of personnel.",

The higher the score for each culture type, the more strongly one recognizes that culture. Cronbach's a was 0.88 in Kim et al, 8 and 0.78 in this study. Job stress includes any kind of job-related stress and was measured with a tool developed by Parker and DeCotiis. 9 Using the tool's 5-point Likert-type scale, the higher the score, the higher the stress level. Cronbach's a was 0.78 in the Parker and DeCotiis' study, 9 and 0.93 in this study. Turnover intention is defined as the intention of members to voluntarily leave the organization. This study used tools developed by Lowler, 10 modified and supplemented for nurses by Shin and Cho. 11 Responses were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale: the higher the score, the higher the turnover intention.

In this study, too, job stress was the factor with the strongest influence, aligned with previous studies. Relation-oriented organizational culture was observed, for the first time, as the factor with the next strongest influence. Many ICNs report experiencing significant stress from their infection-control tasks, conflict over their roles as professional nurses, excessive work, psychological pressure from institutional assessments, and lack of infection control knowledge. 1, 4, 5 Because these stress factors may eventually lead to actual turnover and discontinuation of their infection-control work, proper compensation along with professional and administrative support are necessary to manage job stress and help nurses adapt to the organization. 4, 8, 11 In the analysis, correlating with turnover intention, organizational culture, in which new relationships were formed by 2 or more nurses working together to perform a task (not working alone in infection control), showed lower turnover intention; relation-oriented organizational culture and the innovation-oriented culture scored higher. These correlations were similar to those in general nursing organizations, 8, 9 and the results were the same as those in a preceding study in that relation-oriented organizational culture was the main influential factor that significantly affected turnover intention. 12 Therefore, an infection-control department composed of experts from nursing organizations should pay attention to relation-oriented culture and develop new strategies to establish this culture: organizations should make efforts to foster a sense of community in an organizational dimension and to place importance on positive relationships. The results are expected to help infection-control organizations manage staffing in a stable and efficient manner by lowering ICNs' turnover intention, allowing ICNs to manage their job stress and establish a relation-oriented organizational culture.",
