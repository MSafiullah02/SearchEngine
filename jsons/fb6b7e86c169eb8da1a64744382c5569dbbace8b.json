Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur less frequently. 1 While symptoms remain mild throughout the course of infection in the majority of patients, older patients were identified to be at higher risk of a fatal disease course, with hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease being the most frequent comorbidities in these cohorts. 2, 3 COVID-19 and the liver While pre-existing liver disease is not specifically listed in the published cohort studies, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, reduced platelet counts and reduced albumin levels at the time of admission have been associated with higher mortality, 2 although not all of these alterations are independent risk factors. It remains unclear at this time whether these laboratory test alterations are a sign for pre-existing liver diseases in patients with a more severe course of infection, whether they rather reflect liver damage caused by the virus itself, or whether they mirror a severe inflammatory response (hypoalbuminemia) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombocytopenia).

General measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection will be of utmost importance for these patients. Depending on the local infrastructure, implementation of COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals is warranted. However, based on the local COVID-19-burden, a sharp separation of \"clean\" and \"dirty\" wards/hospitals may not be sustainable, although recent evidence provides somewhat reassuring data regarding the absence of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA of inanimate surfaces outside patient rooms. 20 Wherever possible, patients with chronic liver disease requiring inpatient care for non-COVID-19 causes should be admitted to COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals. As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19. With regards to nosocomial-infections, recent observations from Spain that compared patient characteristics between patients with community-acquired influenza and nosocomial-acquired influenza could not detect a significant difference between these cohorts with regards to underlying chronic liver disease. 21 Whether these observations will also hold up in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be proven.

Although ritonavir-boosted lopinavir showed some antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, a recently published clinical trial in patients with severe COVID-19 showed no effect in vivo compared to no treatment. 28 Other drugs currently under evaluation include chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine. 29 Chloroquine has shown antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro through interference with the ACE2-receptor mediated endocytosis and is widely used in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 as monotherapy, but also in combination with azithromycin. 24, [30] [31] [32] The administration of any of these compounds to infected patients will remain an individual decision as efficacy and optimal timing remain to be clarified. However, with regards to patients with chronic liver disease, possible adverse events have to be kept in mind. This is particularly important with respect to drug-interactions in patients with certain immunosuppressive therapies where drug levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus or everolimus will have to be closely monitored. In addition, patients with impaired liver function are at high risk of drug toxicities, i.e. in patients with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis. Table 1 summarises some considerations with regards to potential toxicities in these patients. It is also important to stress that all the drugs currently under investigation are not approved for SARS-CoV-2.
