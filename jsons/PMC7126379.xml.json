This technology consists of filter paper impregnated with a patented chemical mixture that contains chemical denaturants and a free radical scavenger. The chemical mixture lyses cells and organelles, prevents overgrowth of bacteria, and denatures proteins. The DNA is captured in the matrix and remains tightly bound while proteins and inhibitors are washed. This keeps DNA stable during long-term storage at room temperature (GE Healthcare, 2019).",

We assessed studies that used FTA cards\u00ae for storage and later isolation of RNA of viral origin with subsequent amplification. Different conditions of storage, RNA extraction, or cDNA synthesis were separately summarized when the information was available. We excluded opinion articles, letters to the editor that did not present original data, reviews, as well as articles for which full-text was not accessible through our institutional subscriptions or their information was incomplete.

In this study, ADVANTEC chromatography paper No. 526, (Toyo Roshi, Tokyo, Japan), ADVANTEC filter paper No. 2 (Toyo Roshi), and stationery copy paper were compared with FTA cards\u00ae for the isolation and inactivation of the dsRNA from the infectious bursal disease virus, a virus member of the Birnaviridae family, genus Avibirnavirus, with a segmented genome. In this study, every paper-based matrix allowed the isolation of viral RNA and infectious virus. However, virus inactivation was achieved after phenol fixation on the FTA card\u00ae. Thirteen other studies demonstrated a lack of infectious virus from the FTA card (Moscoso et al., 2005, Moscoso et al., 2006, Perozo et al., 2006, Muthukrishnan et al., 2008, Narayanan et al., 2010, Abdelwhab et al., 2011, Keeler et al., 2012, Linhares et al., 2012, Bankamp et al., 2013, Awad et al., 2014, Tam et al., 2015, Jozwiak et al., 2016, Madhanmohan et al., 2016) when examining (-) ssRNA viruses of the families Paramyxoviridae (Newcastle disease virus, genus Avulavirus, Measles morbillivirus, subfamily Orthoparamyxovirinae, genus Morbillivirus), Orthomyxoviridae (Avian influenza virus, genus Alphainfluenzavirus), and Pneumoviridae (Avian metapneumovirus, genus Metapneumovirus), (+) ssRNA virus members of the family Picornaviridae (Foot-and-mouth disease virus, genus Aphthovirus), Arteriviridae (Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus), and Coronaviridae (Avian coronavirus, genus Gammacoronavirus), and dsRNA virus of the family Birnaviridae (Infectious bursal disease virus, genus Avibirnavirus) and Reoviridae (Rotavirus A, genus Rotavirus). These studies attempted viral isolation from FTA cards impregnated with infected material using cell culture (Moscoso et al., 2006, Muthukrishnan et al., 2008, Keeler et al., 2012, Linhares et al., 2012, Bankamp et al., 2013, Awad et al., 2014, Tam et al., 2015, Madhanmohan et al., 2016), bioassays infecting specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (Moscoso et al., 2005, Perozo et al., 2006, Abdelwhab et al., 2011, Jozwiak et al., 2016) or both (Narayanan et al., 2010).",

Additionally, though we conducted an extensive search in different databases, and the screened works were searched through different institutional subscriptions, four papers were not accessible for full-text assessment. Nevertheless, the search identified more than forty reports evaluating FTA cards\u00ae as RNA immobilization matrix with sufficient information to summarize their protocols for potential replication.",

Use of FTA cards\u00ae may be an attractive approach for fieldwork involving molecular detection and/or characterization of viral pathogens, particularly when simple and cheap sample collection and transport systems are desirable. The stability of RNA genomic material of many different viruses under a wide range of conditions further supports the advantage of FTA cards\u00ae use, even for metagenomic analysis (Yang et al., 2015; Maina et al., 2017b). Though many viruses will become inactivated in the collection and storage process, we suggest that all specimens should be considered potentially infectious unless proven otherwise. Thus, the available evidence suggests that FTA cards\u00ae are a good option for virus storage and transport for molecular detection and identification of RNA viral pathogens, although additional field testing would be advisable to further validate and standardize these methods for use in the fieldwork.",
