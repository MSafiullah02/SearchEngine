            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in cardiovascular regulation [6]. In the RAS, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) metabolises angiotensin I (Ang I) to form angiotensin II (Ang II), which exerts direct trophic actions on cardiovascular cells [6]. Local Ang II production is of key importance in the pathophysiology of the RAS in cardiovascular system [7]. Recently, ACE2, a new member of the RAS, was found to function as a negative regulator of the Ang system by metabolising Ang II to a putatively protective peptide Ang-(1-7) with high efficiency [8], [9], [10]. ACE2 is expressed and active in most tissues. The highest expression of ACE2 is observed in the endothelium, the lungs, and the heart [11]. It has been widely accepted that ACE2 is critical in balancing the activity of the ACE-Ang II axis and thus plays a pivotal role in the body as an endogenous regulator of the RAS [10]. In the present study, we for the first time explored the association between serum ACE2 levels and postoperative morbidity and mortality after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients.",

            "text": "ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs as a membrane-bound protein in the vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary vasculature, and bronchial epithelia [15]. Pulmonary ACE2 appears to have a role in regulating the balance of circulating Ang II/Ang 1-7 levels. Ang II induces pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia, which is important in preventing shunting in patients with lung injury [16]. Locally increased Ang II production also triggers increasing vascular permeability facilitating pulmonary oedema [17]. A recent study suggests that ACE2 protects from severe acute lung failure and COPD, and possibly, pulmonary arterial hypertension [15]. ACE2 protein also appears to be the entry-point receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [18], [19]. In addition, interplay between ACE and ACE2 reportedly plays a pivotal role in the development of tuberculous pleural effusions [20]. Thus, ACE2 appears directly involved in pulmonary vascular regulation as well as in pulmonary infection and pleural effusion. In agreement with the previous studies, we found in the present study that the serum ACE2 level in the lowest quartile was associated with significantly higher rates of pneumonia and pleural effusion after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients.",

In line with this report, we found in the present study that the serum ACE2 level in the lowest quartile was associated with significantly higher rates of atrial fibrillation after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients.

            "text": "Pneumonectomy is a common type of pulmonary resection performed in 10%-30% of patients offered curative resection for primary lung cancer. However, despite improvements in operative techniques and postoperative care, pneumonectomy remains a high-risk procedure [22]. In agreement with this, patients undergoing pneumonectomy had higher rates of postoperative morbidities and in-hospital mortality than those undergoing lobectomy/bilobectomy in this study. We found that the serum ACE2 level in NSCLC patients was significantly elevated 24 hours after major pulmonary resection and returned to baseline level on day 3 postoperatively. Therefore, only the serum ACE2 level on postoperative day 1 was used for subsequent hazard ratio and association analyses. The high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in lung cancer patients can be explained with common risk factors such as older age and tobacco consumption [23], [24]. Thus, the hazard ratio analysis was adjusted for age, current smoking status, and a variety of other confounding factors that may affect the incidence of postoperative morbidities and/or serum ACE2 levels, including sex, BMI, FEV1, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and tumour clinical stages. After adjustment for the confounding factors, the risk of developing postoperative morbidities remained significantly higher in the lowest serum ACE2 level quartile than in the highest quartile on postoperative day 1, indicating that the serum ACE2 level one day post surgery is an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients. Thus, the serum ACE2 level one day post surgery could be used as a biomarker or prognostic factor for postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients. In addition, our findings also suggest that supplementing ACE2 could be a potential therapy for preventing or improving postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection. Given the important role of Ang II/ACE2 signalling in pulmonary vascular regulation, pulmonary infection and pleural effusion, and possibly atrial fibrillation [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], an increase of ACE2 after major pulmonary resection, albeit short-lived, may be a critical compensatory mechanism against initiation of early postoperative morbidities, which leads to reduced manifestation of postoperative morbidities and mortality. Further studies are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms.",
