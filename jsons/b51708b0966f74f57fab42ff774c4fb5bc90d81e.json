Chinese scientists completed isolation of this novel betacoronavirus from patients in Wuhan, and it has been subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) . As of March 6, 2020, a total of 80,813 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections were reported in China, leading to the deaths of 3,073 patients within the country. In Wuhan alone, 49,871 COVID-19 infections have been confirmed with 2,349 deaths and 28,511 patient recoveries. 5 Designated hospitals which can manage COVID-19 effectively are limited in terms of bed availability, staffing, and resources. Nearly 70% of COVID-19 patients display no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Because there are more than 9 million citizens in Wuhan, the designated hospitals cannot admit all patients suspected of infection as well as provide adequate clinical care to severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients. This could lead to a severe strain on healthcare resources and poor quality of patient care.",
