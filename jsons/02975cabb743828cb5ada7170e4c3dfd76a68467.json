These studies evaluated the efficacy of PCT to inactivate pathogens in plasma and the effect of PCT on plasma function. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Jumbo (600 mL) plasma units were inoculated with high titers of test pathogens and treated with 150 \u00b5mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm 2 long-wavelength ultraviolet light. The viability of each pathogen before and after treatment was measured with biological assays. Plasma function was evaluated through measurement of coagulation factors and antithrombotic protein activities.",

In addition, FFP may be used to prepare cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen replacement and treatment of von Willebrand's disease. Typical therapeutic use of FFP for correction of coagulopathy requires transfusion of approximately 10 to 20 mL per kg FFP per transfusion episode, necessitating exposure to multiple donors. 2 Plasma exchange therapy for thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura patients may require repeated large volume FFP transfusions with even greater donor exposures.",

Since the 1990s, the transfusion community has become more receptive to this new approach provided that the method is efficacious, safe, easy to implement, and cost-effective. For plasma, two inactivation technologies, methylene blue treatment 7, 8 and solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment, 9 have received regulatory approval and are currently in clinical use in several countries in Europe. Neither of these methods, however, has a broad range of effectiveness against pathogens, because S/D treatment only inactivates lipid-enveloped viruses, 10 and methylene blue is ineffective against intracellular viruses. 11 Furthermore, S/D treatment has been shown to compromise some of the in vitro coagulation function of plasma and is contraindicated by the FDA for patients undergoing liver transplant. 12 The INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets (PLTs) is the only pathogen inactivation technology for blood cellular components that is CE Marked and in clinical use in several countries in Europe. 13 The INTERCEPT Blood System is a photochemical treatment (PCT) process that utilizes amotosalen (also known as S-59) and longwavelength ultraviolet(UVA; 320-400 nm) light to permanently cross-link helical regions of DNA and RNA. 14 PCT has been shown to inactivate a broad range of viruses, [15] [16] [17] bacteria, 18 and protozoa, 19, 20 as well as white blood cells (WBCs) 21 in PLT concentrates. Because plasma has similar optical properties to PLT concentrate, it is expected that the PCT process developed for use with PLTs is applicable to plasma; thus supporting the synergy of use of the same PCT technology for two blood components in a blood center. These studies evaluated the efficacy of PCT of plasma for the preparation of pathogen inactivated fresh-frozen plasma (FFP).",

Coagulation factors were assayed with one-stage prothrombin time (PT)-based clotting assays (FII, FV, FVII, FX) or one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)-based clotting assays (FVIII, F IX, FXI). The clotting time of a mixture of diluted test plasma sample and plasma deficient in the factor being quantified was compared with a reference curve constructed from the clotting times of five dilutions, ranging from 1:5 to 1:320, of plasma with known activity mixed with deficient plasma. These coagulation tests, as well as the PT and APTT, were performed on an automated coagulation analyzer (MLA Electra 1400C or 1600C, Instrumentation Laboratory Co., Lexington, MA). Reagents included brain thromboplastin (Hemoliance, Instrumentation Laboratory Co.), Platelin L (bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC), and congenital factor-deficient substrate. The endpoint of all tests was the formation of a clot detected photooptically and measured in seconds. The level of the factor being measured was inversely proportional to the time it takes for a clot to form. Factor assay control plasma (FACT; George King Biomedical, Inc., Overland Park, KS) was used as the reference standard for the coagulation factor assays. FXIII was measured with the research-use-only FXIII kit (Berichrom, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). FXIII, activated by thrombin, releases an activation product that leads to a series of reactions resulting in a decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), detected by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm. The assay was performed on a clot timer (BCT, Dade Behring), and standard human plasma (Dade Behring) was used as the reference standard.",

PCT with amotosalen is very effective against cellassociated HIV-1 and against cell-associated HTLV-I and HTLV-II viruses in plasma, demonstrating that amotosalen molecules readily permeate the cell membrane. The ability of the photochemical reagent to permeate the cell membrane as well as nuclear membrane is crucial because some blood-borne viruses exist partially or largely associated with cells. Methylene blue treatment of plasma, for example, is not effective against cell-associated or intracellular viruses. 11 The efficacy of the methylene blue system against intracellular viruses depends on the efficacy of filtration or freeze-thaw to quantitatively disrupt WBCs. 8, 27 Recent studies, however, demonstrate that conventional WBC filters fail to eliminate cell-associated cytomegalovirus and HTLV-I from PLT products. 28, 29 Thus the methylene blue system is ineffective against these viruses.",

            "text": "The cumulative viral inactivation data in PLTs and plasma would predict that PCT is effective against the majority of enveloped viruses, DNA, or RNA, extracellular or intracellular. Thus PCT has the potential to inactivate new and emerging enveloped viruses and prevent them from entering the blood supply. Indeed, it was found that SARS-CoV was inactivated by PCT in both PLTs and plasma. 15 Nonenveloped viruses are less common as labile blood component transfusion-transmitted pathogens. Human parvovirus B19, and in very rare cases hepatitis A virus (HAV), however, have been transmitted by component blood transfusion. 30,31 A ubiquitous nonenveloped virus, TT virus, has been reported to be transmitted through the blood supply in Japan, but has yet to be directly linked with a specific disease state. 32 The efficacy of PCT against nonenveloped viruses in plasma continues to be evaluated and is expected to be similar to the results obtained for PLTs. 16 In these studies, inactivation experiments were only performed with two nonenveloped viruses, bluetongue virus and human adenovirus 5, as examples. Inactivation results comparable to the PLT experiments were obtained. Owing to the low permeability of the capsid, some nonenveloped viruses show little or no inactivation by PCT. The picornaviruses are known to be the most difficult to inactivate by chemical or physical means. 33 The tight capsid structure of picornaviruses such as HAV, polio virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus are thought to exclude even low-molecular-weight compounds such as psoralens from the interior of the virus and PCT is ineffective against these viruses. Human parvovirus B19 and human adenovirus 5, however, were found sensitive to PCT in PLTs. 16, 34 The level of inactivation for these nonenveloped viruses can be increased by incubating the spiked blood products with amotosalen before illumination with UVA light. 34 The methylene blue system also showed variable efficacy against nonenveloped viruses, ranging from ineffective to complete inactivation. 8 Another system for treatment of plasma, the S/D system, is ineffective against nonenveloped viruses. S/D inactivates viruses by disrupting the viral membrane. 10 PCT is effective for inactivation of gram-positive S. epidermidis and gram-negative K. pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica. Y. enterocolitica are cryophilic bacteria that can grow in cold temperatures. High levels of inactivation were achieved for all of these bacteria in plasma. Although transfusion-transmitted bacteremia is not considered a serious problem for transfusion of FFP, it is reassuring to have a pathogen inactivation process that inactivates bacteria as well as viruses. In these studies, inactivation of two spirochetes, T. pallidum and B. burgdorferi, in plasma was also demonstrated. T. pallidum, which causes syphilis, is the only bacteria routinely screened for in blood banks. Under experimental conditions, B. burgdorferi has been reported to remain viable in frozen plasma for more than 1 month. 35 PCT has been shown to be effective against these agents and high levels of inactivation were obtained in plasma.",

            "text": "On an international level, other organisms such as T. cruzi (Chagas' disease), P. falciparum (malaria), and B. microti (babesiosis) may be more of a concern than bacteria for frozen plasma because, like viruses, they do not require growth during storage to be a transfusion risk. P. falciparum and B. microti are intracellular pathogens, as discussed above, and are resistant to methylene blue treatment. 11 Experiments with plasma are ongoing to measure the level of WBC inactivation by PCT. Based on previous studies with PLTs, it is anticipated that high levels of WBC inactivation could be demonstrated in plasma. 21 Overall, the results presented here show that PCT offers the benefit of a broad spectrum of pathogen inactivation. Neither the methylene blue system nor the S/D system for plasma has shown this broad pathogen inactivation profile. These studies also confirmed maintenance of adequate plasma coagulation and antithrombotic protein function after PCT. Because FFP is transfused primarily as a replacement for the liver-derived coagulation factors FII, FV, FVII, F IX, FX, and FXI, in vitro studies to evaluate plasma function after processing with PCT were conducted for a panel of coagulation factors, antithrombotic proteins, and clotting time. The proteins most affected by PCT were fibrinogen and FVIII. The changes in coagulation proteins observed in plasma treated with PCT were also associated with slight prolongation in PT and APTT. The slight changes in PT and APTT after PCT, however, were not associated with any adverse clinical observations. [36] [37] [38] [39] Levels of the anticoagulant PC and PS and antithrombin were relatively unaffected by PCT and \u03b12-antiplasmin was conserved by 80 percent. Previous studies on cryoprecipitate prepared from PCT plasma yielded approximately 95 and 88 percent activity retention for fibrinogen and FVIII, respectively, compared to cryoprecipitate prepared from untreated plasma. 40 Furthermore, cryosupernatant prepared from PCT plasma retained adequate levels of critical plasma proteins for plasma exchange therapy in acute thrombocytopenic purpura. The data indicate good preservation of hemostasis control proteins such as PS, \u03b12-antiplasmin, and VWF-cleaving protease activity. 41 From a blood center perspective, the adoption of PCT would enhance safety of blood products and potentially decrease the number of donors rejected. PCT is easily integrated into the plasma preparation system by its ability to treat individual units of fresh apheresis plasma and small pools (three) of whole blood-derived plasma. For further ease of use, PCT is compatible with the existing plasma collection procedures, FFP processing, and distribution methods in use in blood centers. This PCT system allows rapid illumination and processing of plasma units and utilizes the same illumination device developed for pathogen inactivation of PLT concentrates. Thus, both plasma and PLTs can be treated with a similar processing system and the same illumination device.",
