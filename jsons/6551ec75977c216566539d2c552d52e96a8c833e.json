Indeed, the meeting \"CYTO Asia,\" which should have been held in Shanghai in early September 2020, has been postponed to 2021. Similarly, in different parts of the world, a relevant number of scientific and nonscientific meetings are now being canceled. Moreover, several prestigious research centers and universities are prohibiting their members and employees not only from traveling to \"dangerous\" countries but also from participating in any sort of domestic or international meeting, for 60 days at least. Several countries have adopted similar decisions at the government level.",

However, in the last decades, there has been an increased spillover of viruses from natural hosts (like the bat) to intermediate hosts (like market civets and dromedary camels) and then to humans, likely because of human activities, including modern agricultural practices and urbanization. Coronaviruses are broadly distributed in humans and in other mammals, and there are at least seven viruses that have been able to pass from animals to humans, crossing the species barriers and infecting humans (7) . Some of them are, however, relatively innocuous and cause the common cold, while those quoted here below are extremely dangerous for human health as they are highly pathogenic, able to be readily transmitted from human to human, and able to spread to multiple continents in a very short time. Thus, to cope with this epidemic, and to substantially contribute to the fight against SARS-CoV-2, we have to learn the lesson derived from two recent outbreaks caused by two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses.",

SARS affected 17 countries and, during an epidemic of a few months, caused 774 deaths of 8,096 laboratory-confirmed cases (9). The second was due to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV that, in 2012, was first described in a man in Saudi Arabia (10) . MERS has been found in 27 countries and is still present in many of them because of the continuing introduction from dromedary camels. Until last November 2019, MERS has caused 858 deaths of 2,494 laboratoryconfirmed cases (11). The present epidemic due to SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher number of cases. As of the middle of March, there are over 100,000 confirmed cases all over the world, with over 3,500 deaths (for a continuous update, see https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index. html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 (12)).",

            "text": "Several studies have described the biological and immunological features of the previous coronavirus epidemics, and obviously, most researchers have used flow cytometry to describe the changes in T and B lymphocytes, as well as the role of inflammatory cells in the immunopathogenesis of the disease (reviewed in Ref. (13) ). Currently, very limited information is available on the host innate immune status of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and regard the description of increased total neutrophils, reduced total lymphocytes, and increased serum levels of IL-6 and of C-reactive protein, which suggest a strong inflammatory response. This is indeed evidenced by reports detecting abnormally high plasma levels of innate cytokines such as IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF\u03b1 or of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF\u03b1). Furthermore, mortality is higher in patients with elevated levels of IL-6 (14) . The overall picture is similar to what happens during SARS and MERS and underlines the fact that leukocyte alterations and a cytokine storm that initiates a viral sepsis could be important in the pathogenesis of Covid-19. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, as of middle of March 2020 no data have been published on the specific cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The first data on changes in lymphocyte populations in patients severely affected by Covid-19 indicate a low T cells count, an increase in na\u00efve helper T cells and a decrease in memory helper T cells (15) . Thus, the immunopathogenesis of this disease is still largely unknown. However, several groups, including ours, are now investigating different molecular, cellular and immunological aspects. Confirming this previous report (15), Figure 1 shows our most recent data, related to the distribution of different subpopulations of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from four aged patients in the symptomatic phase of the infection.",

Thus, to begin: why do some patients get infected but do not develop any disease, while others die from the infection? Which are the protective factors, and which are the biomarkers that clinicians could use to predict, and eventually modify, the course of the disease? Assuming that the scant, available data are reliable, why do children seem to develop a milder form of Covid-19, similar to what was described in the case of SARS? Can the immaturity of the immune system protect against immunemediated damages that could occur during Covid-19? Which assays are useful to monitor the efficacy of an antiviral therapy? How can we help in developing a vaccine?",

Cells were stained with the Duraclone IM T cell panel (from Beckman Coulter, FL, USA) added with another five fluorescent mAbs and a marker of cell viability and analyzed on a CytoFLEX LX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Beside side and forward scatters, markers were CD45 conjugated with Krome Orange, CD3 APC-A750, CD4 APC, CD8 AF700, CD27 PC7, CD57 Pacific Blu, CD279 (PD-1) PC5.5, CD28 ECD, CCR7 PE, CD45RA FITC, HLA-DR BUV661, CD127 BV650, CD25 BV785, CD95 BUV395, CD38 BUV496, and PromoFluor-840 (Promokine). Unsupervised analysis of electronically gated CD45+, CD3+, CD4+ or CD45+, CD3+, CD8+ T-cells was first performed by using the Catalyst package (Bioconductor)(16). Second, for both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell analysis, 10,000 cells per sample were concatenated and transformed. FlowSOM was used to perform the metaclustering (K = 20); then, data were represented by the dimensionality reduction method named Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). It is possible to observe the presence of 12 clusters among CD4+ and 13 among CD8+ T-cells and to see the high amount of naive cells in both T cell populations, and how the distribution of naive, memory, activated and exhausted lymphocytes is different among different types of CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes.",
