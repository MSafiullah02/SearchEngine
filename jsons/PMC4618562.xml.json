Coronaviruses are a diverse group of positive\u2010strand RNA viruses that commonly infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds. Human coronaviruses are most commonly associated with mild respiratory illnesses, but can cause severe illness, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Genetic sequencing data indicate that the MERS\u2010CoV is a betacoronavirus closely related to two bat coronaviruses (HKU4 and HKU5), but distinct from other human coronaviruses, including SARS\u2010CoV 1, 3.",

The cases have originated from the following countries Middle Eastern countries to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom have also reported laboratory\u2010confirmed cases 2, 4, 5. The first known MERS\u2010CoV infections were detected retrospectively as occurring in April 2012 in Jordan 6. Based on confirmed cases to date, the clinical syndrome consists of febrile illness and pneumonia, as well as renal failure in some patients. The majority of reported cases have been in adults and 64 of 151 cases have been fatal (42%) 4. Some cases have occurred in clusters. One cluster involved two cases, both fatal, occurring near Amman, Jordan (Zarga, 20 km in distance), in April 2012 6. Stored samples from these two cases (one hospital worker and one student) tested positive for MERS\u2010CoV retrospectively, and this cluster was temporally associated with cases of illness among hospital workers. Several other clusters suggested human transmission 5, 7, 8; although the risk of sustained transmission is unknown 2, 5.",

A critical question is whether the cases identified thus far are the only MERS\u2010CoV infections or whether the virus has circulated more widely undetected. This is of interest in light of the epidemiology of SARS\u2010CoV, where infections in children < 12 years of age were generally milder, with no mortality and few hospitalizations 9. To determine whether MERS\u2010CoV was present among young paediatric ARI cases before, during and after the occurrence of the Zarga, Jordan MERS\u2010CoV cluster, we tested upper respiratory tract specimens collected from a prospective study of paediatric ARI hospitalizations in Amman, Jordan, from March 2010 to September 2012.",

Young children are known to be a source of respiratory viral transmission; therefore, our negative findings epidemiologically suggest that MERS\u2010CoV may not have been widely circulating in nearby metropolitan Amman, Jordan, during this interval. This is an important finding because there remains uncertainty over whether confirmed MERS\u2010CoV cases are more likely to be detected due to the severity of illness, and the full extent to which MERS\u2010CoV circulates more widely causing mild illness 8. Nevertheless, further surveillance is still needed in the Arabian Peninsula and neighbouring countries to monitor current circulation and possible emergence of widespread transmission.
