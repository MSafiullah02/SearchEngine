(Mohammed) Bishr Omary was always called by his middle rather than first given name, as is typical in the Middle East, because Mohammed (spelled at least 8 different ways) is the most common first name in the Middle East and is given by parents with the hope that their son will become a good person. The eldest of 3 siblings, Bishr was born in New York City, where his Syrian parents, Ibrahim and Dalal Omary, raised him for 5 years before the family returned to Damascus, Syria. His parents came to New York City because his dad attended graduate school at Columbia University, where he obtained an MS degree in political science (he had a law degree in Syria but did not practice law), supported by a Syrian scholarship. His dad also worked at the United Nations while going to school. Back in Syria, his dad worked with the Ministry of Urban Planning. His younger two siblings, a sister, Nashwa Ulsaker, and a brother, Reed, were born in Damascus (Photo 1\nA and B\n). His parents emigrated to the United States in 1968, knowing the opportunities their kids would have in the future, although it was challenging to find work initially. When asked about their decision to return to the United States, Bishr says, \u201cI am eternally grateful to my parents from whom I learned the meaning of hard work and unconditional love. The opportunities in the US open so many doors compared with many other countries, including Syria then and especially now given the ongoing 9-year civil war that has ravaged the country.\u201d",

When Reed was asked by us to give some insights about Bishr he remarked, \u201cAs my older brother, Bishr instilled many important values in me. One of those values has been to be kind and generous. For instance, Bishr has always been the first to offer to pay for everyone\u2019s meal, even if there is a large party going out for dinner. Second, he considers a good sense of humor essential. Filling sugar containers with salt, placing toothpaste on combs, and gifting a cut-up spaghetti-stained polyester tie were considered normal everyday activities in our family because of Bishr. Finally, Bishr exemplified the value of hard work, and the sense of duty that underlies that work ethic. After all, it was Bishr who taught me as a 10-year-old boy that it was normal to spend evenings in the lab. Of course, he has taught those same values to many others!\u201d",

            "text": "The 9 years that Bishr spent in Syria still bring him fond memories. When he left New York City for Damascus he spoke only English; as a youngster, he learned Arabic quickly but lost the English he knew because no one around him spoke it. At that time, the educational system required everyone to take a foreign language class starting in 7th grade (Russian, French, or English). He was allowed to enroll in the English class (because he knew how to count to 10 and convinced the principal, who apparently looked the other way!); otherwise he could have been assigned 1 of the other 2 languages. Starting in 7th grade, he became interested in chemistry after acquiring a chemistry textbook from his 12th-grade neighbor. At the age of 12 years, he set up a \u201clab\u201d in a small storage room that was on the roof of the building he lived in, and recalled using his limited allowance and any holiday gift money to buy chemicals that, surprisingly, were available in the marketplace and sold to a young, clueless kid. Had his parents knew he was mixing sodium with water to generate hydrogen gas, they would have put an immediate stop to it! Now we know what Reed meant in his quote.",

            "text": "Upon moving to the United States in September 1968, his father enrolled him in 10th grade at Washington Lee High School in Arlington, VA. Although his English writing and speaking skills were limited, Bishr convinced the chemistry teacher (Thomas H. Christie Sr, also a Baptist minister and chair of the high school science department), after naming all the elements of several rows of the periodic table (which he had studied on his own in Syria), to allow him to take chemistry as a sophomore (usually recommended for seniors). Bishr did very well in this class, and that led Mr Christie to ask him to be his chemistry laboratory class assistant, which Bishr did during his junior and senior years. During his junior year and the summer prior, Bishr worked at McDonald\u2019s and then worked full-time during his senior school year in a Marriott Hot Shoppes restaurant (as dishwasher, busboy, cook, waiter, and cashier). Getting home at midnight was not compatible with good grades, but it was his chemistry professor and the fact that he was a starter on the high school soccer team that led to his acceptance to George Mason College (1 year before it became George Mason University) as a chemistry major. His first 2\u00bd years at Mason focused on playing college soccer (he was good enough to have a 50% tuition scholarship during his last 2 years) and working at the Hot Shoppes restaurant, where he was asked to enroll in manager school. Fortunately, he made the strategic decision to spend more time in the library and less time playing foosball and table tennis in the student union; that simple maneuver completely transformed his grades (his GPA was barely 2.0). Here again, it was another mentor, Dr Wayne Stalick, his organic chemistry professor and volleyball coach (Bishr also played college volleyball), who took him under his wing and advocated for him to be accepted at the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) and Duke University PhD programs in chemistry; Bishr selected UCSD, and little did he know that this decision would be transformative.",

Playing with one of the San Diego City soccer league teams, Bishr met Dr Ian Trowbridge (who played fullback; Bishr was a midfielder), who asked him to join his lab as a graduate student. Ian, a young assistant professor at the Salk Institute, did not have a joint faculty appointment at UCSD to allow him to be Bishr\u2019s PhD mentor, but this was solved because Robert Holley (Ian\u2019s postdoctoral mentor and a 1968 Nobel Laureate for isolating transfer RNA and mapping its structure) was professor at the Salk Institute and UCSD and agreed to be a secondary mentor for Bishr. Working in the Trowbridge Laboratory took Bishr away from hardcore bioinorganic chemistry to cell and cancer biology. As a PhD student, Bishr published 4 articles (including 2 in Journal of Experimental Medicine and 1 in Nature) and then stayed for 1 extra year in Ian\u2019s laboratory as a postdoc to complete some unfinished work and publish 5 additional articles. The most impactful discovery made by Bishr while in the Trowbridge laboratory was the novel identification and characterization of the transferrin receptor. Simply remarkable!",

Bishr will tell you that persistence paid off because it took him 3 attempts to gain acceptance. No one read his application initially because of his low undergraduate school GPA, despite his record as a graduate and postdoctoral student and letters of recommendation from 2 Nobel Laureates from the Salk Institute (it is easier to become an AGA member, so to you readers, please apply to join the AGA if you are not a member!). Bishr did his internal medicine residency training at University of California-Irvine, where he was awarded the Intern of the Year honor after completing his internship because of how he excelled at patient care. Bishr credits his residency program director, Dr David Powers, for allowing him to start his gastrointestinal (GI) fellowship at UCSD 6 months early, at a time when short-tracking was not common. His fellowship at UCSD (1987\u20131989) was under the tutelage of the late Dr Jon Isenberg and the laboratory mentorship of the late Dr Martin Kagnoff, both GI luminaries. Bishr also credits Jon and Marty for being huge advocates and supporters of his training and academic career. During his GI fellowship, Bishr was also able to spend 3 months in Royal Liverpool University Hospital in England as an \u201chonorary senior registrar\u201d under the mentorship of Sir Ian Gilmore (through a fortuitous meeting with Dr Gilmore during the 1988 Digestive Disease Week, arranged by Dr Samuel Marcus, who had previously trained at the Liverpool GI unit). He remains thankful for the opportunity provided to him by Dr Gilmore to learn and perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (a \u201ccloset\u201d interventionalist endoscopist, in case any reader wants to recruit Bishr!) and laser treatment for GI cancers; he is also grateful to have met his gracious hosts, Drs Ian and Sharon Finnie (gastroenterologist and family physician, respectively), who welcomed him to share a \u201cflat\u201d with them. After being totally spoiled in the United Kingdom, as he fondly recalls, Bishr returned from England in May 1989 and lived with his close friend (and UCSD co-GI fellow) Craig Chow and Craig\u2019s wife, Paula, for 6 weeks before driving to Palo Alto to start his faculty position at Stanford University. He has not forgotten the fresh, daily, home-cooked meals that they graciously provided! When Dr Steve Pandol, who was one of Bishr\u2019s GI attendings during his GI fellowship training, was asked what he recalled about Bishr, he stated \u201cBishr joined our GI fellowship training program at UCSD and worked with Marty Kagnoff during his fellowship and published 4 first author manuscripts (including one in Science). He would finish his clinical duties during the day and go the lab and continue his experiments and making discoveries at night. At the time he was finishing his GI fellowship, he indicated to us that he wanted to learn advanced endoscopic techniques. We didn\u2019t offer this training at UCSD to research-oriented fellows and we wondered why Bishr wanted further clinical training in endoscopy as he was slated to have an exceptional laboratory-based academic career. However, Bishr persisted and spent 3 months in an outstanding clinical unit in Liverpool. Never did I think he was doing this because he would become a leader of the entire GI community. From the days of his fellowship to now, he is always extraordinary polite, gracious and giving. He sets a model and standard for all of us in the field.\u201d",

Harry took over for Dr Gary Gray, who had ably overseen that division for the previous 17 years. Bishr was 1 of 3 young laboratory-based gastroenterologists recruited to Stanford by Harry in the late 1980s as part of a plan to grow that division. Bishr\u2019s research credentials were unusually strong for a newly minted GI fellow and his highly laudatory recommendations for research potential (and clinical prowess) from the late Drs Kagnoff, Isenberg, and Trowbridge proved prescient. In short, Bishr was a division chief\u2019s and department of medicine chair\u2019s dream recruit; he came to Stanford having just completed his GI fellowship with a US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Merit Award, a VA Career Development Award, and a Pew Scholar Award, so the division chief did not need to worry about him for at least 4 years!",

His research, which was directed initially by a genetic mouse model that his group developed, led to the identification of select keratin variants as risk factors for acute and chronic liver disease progression, which was published in several high-profile journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Gastroenterology, Journal of Clinical Investigation, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He became one of the elite translational scientists who has been able to carry his investigations bidirectionally between the bench and the bedside.",

Highlights of his remarkable tenure at Stanford include having served as Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (the name of the division changed under his tenure from the Division of Gastroenterology to its current name), as the director of Stanford\u2019s National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u2013funded GI Training grant, and as the Co-Director and then Director of Stanford\u2019s NIH-funded multidisciplinary Digestive Disease Center for 8 years before his departure in 2008 to the University of Michigan (UM). Not only did Bishr excel in his administrative activities at the local level, but he also took on a variety of national and international leadership roles. For example, he was selected as Vice Chair, then Chair, of the prestigious Gordon Conference on Intermediate Filaments. He also co-chaired a symposium on intermediate filaments for the American Society for Cell Biology, served the AGA in several capacities (see below), and was the Continuing Medical Education Course Director (Advances in Gastroenterology for the Primary Care Physician) for 4 years.

During his Stanford years, he was supported by 11 different NIH-funded R-type grants, by a long-running VA Merit Review Grant, and by 2 sequential VA Career Development Grants, to which he attributes cementing his academic and research success. Near the time he departed to UM he held 2 NIH R01 grants, a VA Merit Award (function and dysfunction of intermediate filaments in the digestive system), an NIH R25 (making a digestive disease career palatable), and was co-principal investigator of an NIH R01 (epithelial refluxate interactions in Barrett\u2019s esophagus). Importantly for the Stanford GI division, before his departure to Michigan he had co-spearheaded the acquisition and direction of a highly coveted NIH Digestive Disease Center Grant for 2 continuous segments (10 years). Of note, Bishr\u2019s success in research and in securing peer-reviewed research funding was legendary at Stanford. The rumor among GI and other postdoctoral trainees and among his colleagues was that he was only able to do this because he had a sleeping bag in his office (we think he took it to UM and then Rutgers!). Most impressively, Bishr accomplished all of this while always being available for his trainees and colleagues, and while taking on patient care, which he enjoyed and at which he was equally adept. He was the only physician-scientist gastroenterologist at Stanford who also managed therapeutic endoscopy cases while on clinical service or call, and he even took call the very last week as he was departing to UM.",

            "text": "In 2008, Bishr was recruited to the UM to serve as Chair of the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, where he followed Dr John A. Williams, who chaired the department for 21 years. Bishr was also appointed as Pollard Professor of Medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine. The physiology department had been interested in recruiting an MD, PhD to guide the department into translational studies. Bishr fit the bill and performed in a spectacular manner, recruiting a number of young and established tenure-track faculty, including Drs Daniel Beard, Christian Burgess, Howard Crawford, Carol Elias, Jun Hee Lee, Scott Leiser, Malcolm Low, Suzanne Moenter, Yatrik Shah, Jun Wu, Lei Yin, William Rainey, Costas Lyssiotis, and Ling Qi. He was a master of forming partnerships with interdisciplinary units that made the recruitments to physiology possible, including the Center for Aging, the Cancer Center, the Cardiovascular Center, the Endocrine Oncology Center, the Department of Internal Medicine and several of its divisions, and the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Emergency Medicine. Most of these outstanding recruited faculty brought grants with them, and all secured grants upon joining the department. As the department grew to 38 faculty in 2017, it became the NIH\u2019s top-funded physiology department in the United States (!) to go with its already long-standing stellar reputation. It was also the biggest and most well-funded basic science department at the UM. Bishr also continued the tradition of appointing joint faculty, primarily from the Department of Medicine, including Dr Chung Owyang who played an important role in recruiting Bishr to Michigan. At the time he stepped down from his role as chair, the Department included 85 primary and joint faculty. Dr John Carethers, recently selected AGA Vice President and current Chair of Medicine at the UM stated when asked about Bishr \u201cI knew of Bishr\u2019s great reputation when I was GI Chief at UCSD due to his past training there, and his leadership at Stanford as head of GI. Little did I know that I would work directly with him with his recruitment to Michigan in 2008 and my recruitment there in 2009. There, I directly witnessed Bishr\u2019s under-the-radar demeanor but extremely hard-working ethic behind the scenes. We forged ideas along with Dr Chung Owyang, Chief of GI, with Bishr as the driver that led to Michigan hosting the editorship of Gastroenterology. Bishr is one of the most well-rounded academic physicians you will find, having been a leader of a clinical GI Division and a chair of a basic science department, guiding MDs and PhDs toward excellence in the care of patients, conducting innovative research, and educating fellows, pre- and post-docs for their craft. Bishr is very thoughtful, has an incredible ability to complete multiple tasks on time, elevates the mood and pulls out the best capabilities of people he recruits and interacts with. I certainly am thrilled for Bishr leading the AGA, and I know that the whole GI and liver community is in good hands with Bishr guiding our organization.\u201d",

In addition, he co-directed an NIH K12 program that supports training of postdoctoral fellows in research as well as teaching at partner community colleges with a high percentage of students with minority backgrounds. Bishr also ran a successful NIH- and VA-funded research laboratory and collaborated widely with other faculty. He was admired and respected by the department, as he had an almost monastic dedication to the department and became its most vocal booster (Photo 3\n). We take some credit for what took place in Ann Arbor in 2012, when he met and married his wife Souha.",

Maybe it is his GI genes, but Bishr strongly believed that good food helps make a good department. However, he received his comeuppance one time when he organized a faculty lunch to celebrate recent promotions and the next day everyone came down with gastroenteritis. For several years after that when he suggested food, people reminded him not to use that caterer. This, however, did not stop him because he still provided lunch during the weekly conference calls during his term as Editor-in-Chief of Gastroenterology (see below).
