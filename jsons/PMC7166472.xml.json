This virus has been classified as a member of the genus Metapneumovirus of the subfamily Pneumovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae [Van Den Hoogen et al., 2001; Boivin et al., 2002; Bastien et al., 2003]. Subsequently, hMPV was described as a cause of acute respiratory disease in many countries, including Canada, the United States, Australia, Japan, France, Hong Kong, and Korea [Ord\u00e1s et al., 2006]. hMPV is recognized as a common cause of respiratory infections, ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to severe lower respiratory tract infection, in individuals of all ages, particularly in infants and children [Boivin et al., 2002; Freymouth et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Van Den Hoogen et al., 2003; McAdam et al., 2004; Loo et al., 2007]. However, limited data exist for hMPV infection, especially concerning its prevalence, and molecular and clinical characterizations of hMPV in children with lower respiratory tract infections in China, with the exception of a previous study in Lanzhou City [Xiao et al., 2010].",

In this study, 1,165 children with lower respiratory tract infections in Changsha City were screened for hMPV and several other common respiratory viruses, and the epidemiological and clinical features of infection with the various hMPV genotypes were characterized.",

            "text": "Of the 1,165 children with lower respiratory tract infection included in this study, 6.5% were hMPV\u2010positive by RT\u2010PCR. A similar incidence was reported in Singapore [Loo et al., 2007], the United States [McAdam et al., 2004], Hong Kong [Peiris et al., 2003], and in Lanzhou City [Xiao et al., 2010], although the findings were different from those of other studies [McAdam et al., 2004; Chung et al., 2006; Bosis et al., 2008; Heikkinen et al., 2008]. Independent of the techniques used, several studies have demonstrated that hMPV infection occurs predominantly early in childhood [Esper et al., 2003; Dollner et al., 2004; McAdam et al., 2004]. By the age of 5 years, >90% of individuals screened have evidence of hMPV infection. In this study, the majority of patients who were hMPV\u2010positive (93.4% 71/76) were less than 5 years old. No significant differences in the age distribution rate were detected, but a study from Chongqing, a city in southwestern China, reported that younger children (less than 6 months old) had the highest rate of hMPV infection [Chen et al., 2010]. Van Den Hoogen et al. [2001] and Bastien et al. [2003] reported that no significant difference in the prevalence of hMPV existed between male and female patients. In this study, the majority of patients infected with hMPV (59/76) were male, and statistical analysis found differences in prevalence between males and females, which indicated that male patients are at a higher risk of hMPV infection. hMPV was detected in each month with the exception of September and October 2007 and August 2008. Positive specimens peaked in March and April, in agreement with findings from the United States [McAdam et al., 2004], Canada [Bastien et al., 2003], and a previous study [Xiao et al., 2010]. However, hMPV was detected year\u2010round in Singapore [Loo et al., 2007] and peaked during the summer months in Hong Kong [Peiris et al., 2003]. Although these data suggest that hMPV may follow varying epidemiologic patterns in different regions, elucidation of the exact epidemiologic characteristics of hMPV infection requires further investigation.",

Human bocavirus and RSV were the most common coinfecting viruses (36.4% and 29.5%, respectively). The data regarding the impact of coinfections of human bocavirus and RSV with hMPV on disease severity are conflicting [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005; Caracciolo et al., 2008].

Indeed, Arabpour et al. [2008] reported a higher prevalence of lower respiratory tract infection in children infected with hMPV. However, the present study encompasses only hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infection; therefore, the prevalence of upper respiratory tract infection and lower respiratory tract infection could not be elucidated. Additionally, Williams et al. [2004] reported that one\u2010third of children with hMPV\u2010associated lower respiratory tract infection were diagnosed with concomitant acute otitis media.

These symptoms are identical to those reported in children in Canada and Korea [Chung et al., 2006; Caracciolo et al., 2008]. No significant difference was observed in the frequencies of cough, fever, respiratory crepitations, wheezing, vomiting, diarrhea, or duration of stay in hospital between the hMPV mono\u2010 and coinfection groups. More than one\u2010half of patients with hMPV had normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C\u2010reactive protein and leukocyte counts, and a majority had hepatic and renal injury. Data on whether hMPV infection can induce hepatic and renal injury are limited; therefore, this aspect requires further study. Chest radiographs of the majority of patients who were hMPV\u2010positive showed sporadic consolidation of the lung, 21.1% (12/57) showed interstitial lung disease and emphysema, and only one patient showed consolidation in lobar distribution, pleural effusion, and single hila of pulmonary swelling, which is consistent with a report from Korea [Chung et al., 2006].",

A significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea was observed between subjects who were hMPV\u2010positive with and without underlying illnesses (P = 0.024), which suggests that hMPV infection may cause different clinical presentations in patients depending on the underlying conditions. However, no significant difference was detected in the detection rate, age, sex, duration of stay in hospital, the majority of clinical diagnoses, or clinical symptoms between the two groups (Table III). These data suggest that hMPV infection did not aggravate clinical symptoms or contribute to duration of hospital stay in subjects with underlying illnesses. Three subjects had congenital heart disease, which ranked first in terms of underlying diseases. Two each had gastroesophageal reflux and measles. Further study is needed to investigate whether congenital heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or measles poses a major risk factor for hMPV infection.",

In this study, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the simultaneous existence of two groups (A and B) and two of the four subgroups (A2 and B2). The majority of these strains (94.7%, 72/76) clustered predominantly with group A hMPV, and all belonged to subgroup A2 (100%, 72/72), which is consistent with the work of Boivin et al. [2004]. Moreover, a previous study in Lanzhou City showed that sublineages A1, A2 (A2a and A2b), and B1 co\u2010circulated during the 2006\u20132007 epidemic, but only A2 circulated during the 2007\u20132008 epidemic [Xiao et al., 2010].
