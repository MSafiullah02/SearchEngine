This difficult problem must be solved. Early warning is the most effective way to solve this problem. Here, we aim to determine the best performing model to track the epidemic of AIDS, which will provide a methodological basis for testing the time characteristics of the disease. From January 2004 to January 2018, we built four computing methods based on AIDS dataset: BPNN model, RNN model, LSTM model and MHPSO-GRU model. Compare the final estimated performance to determine the preferred method. Result. Considering the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean error rate (MER) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in the simulation and prediction subsets, the MHPSO-GRU model is determined as the best performance technology. Estimates for the period from May 2018 to December 2020 suggest that the event appears to continue to increase and remain high.",

Since 1997, the annual incidence of AIDS in the world has declined slightly, but it is still one of the most important causes of death in the world's major disease burden [4] - [7] . It is estimated that there were 1.8 million new infections in 2016, with an average life expectancy of 40.32 years. About 70% of these new infections occur in low and middle-income countries, with investment spending reaching 8.13 billion US dollars [8] .",

In addition, the mortality rate of AIDS in class B statutory infectious diseases is the highest from 2008 to 2017, and the vaccine has not been determined [11] , [12] . Therefore, facing the major public health challenges and threats brought by AIDS, and providing a clear and quantitative direction for effective formulation of preventive plans and rational allocation of limited available resources, this is a high-precision and accurate understanding of the prediction model of AIDS epidemic behavior is necessary. Jia J established an HIV / AIDS epidemic model with general nonlinear incidence and treatment methods, and studied the stability of disease-free balance and unique local balance [13] . Wang Yawen established the combination of autoregressive moving average model, generalized regression neural network and ARIMA model. ARIMA (1,1,1) (0,1,1) 12 and ARIMA-GRNN model can better predict the monthly incidence of AIDS in China, but the effect of the combined model is better [14] . Yang K used nonparametric local smoothing method to develop a flexible and effective data modeling method for St disease incidence, monitoring the incidence of cancer, AIDS, cardiovascular disease and other chronic or infectious diseases, with good results [15] . Mar Masi \u00e1used the multi state method to predict the development of PLWH into non AIDS events, and estimated three transfer probabilities: from alive and NAE free to alive and NAE experienced (''NAE development''); from alive and NAE experienced to death (''death after NAE'') [16] . Rezaei s elucidates the overall prevalence of depression in HIV / AIDS patients through systematic review and metaanalysis [17] . Adamu incidence rate in various states affected by insurgency activities in Boko Haram, Nigeria, collected data from 2004 to 2017, reporting 16 [18] . The information of 102 patients, including age, gender, diagnosis year and patient status, found that most of the HIV / AIDS infected people were women in these Boko Haram areas. Although these laws were discovered, they did not give a trend of future incidence rate. Deribew A studied the development trend of HIV / AIDS mortality in Ethiopia from 1990 to 2016, found that the decline of HIV / AIDS mortality was relatively slow, and provided the corresponding HIV testing and treatment plan, but did not give a future development trend, and the plan had a certain lag [19] .",

It combines the bottom features of data into the top features through deep neural network, and is used for classification, prediction and other tasks. Compared with the traditional shallow learning methods such as neural network, logic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, etc., its network depth is deeper, its nonlinear representation ability is stronger, and its network learning ability is stronger. Shallow learning is often ineffective in dealing with complex problems, even when the number of samples is sufficient. This is because the network complexity is low and the learning ability is not strong. Even if a large number of samples are input, some important details cannot be learned. However, in the past, due to the limitation of computing power, blindly increasing the number of layers and parameters of the network is easy to lead to slow convergence and over fitting of the network. Today's deep learning technology can effectively solve these problems. While increasing the network depth, greedy layer by layer training method is used to prevent over fitting and improve the network performance.",

From Figure 4 , it can be seen that the new memory information is obtained from the synthesis of the hidden unit states at t time input: x t i and t \u2212 1 time, indicating that the new memory can have the new input information and historical information at the same time. The reset gate determines the weight of the hidden unit information in time t \u2212 1 to the new memory information \u223ct s h in time [29] . If the current time state is independent of the previous time, the reset door can prevent the transmission of the previous time information. However, there is an update gate as the final output control gate, and the information of the previous moment can also be transmitted through the update gate. The weights of the new memory information and the hidden unit information at time: t \u2212 1 are respectively controlled by the update gate. The above is the basic working principle of GRU, which can not only solve the problem of RNN gradient disappearing, but also reduce the network parameters compared with LSTM, and has faster convergence speed.

In addition, when HP filtering is used to remove the short-term monthly effects of AIDS incidence to analyze long-term trends and periodicity, a trough is usually observed in January and February each year, and the case is frequently reported in December each year. The number of notified cases remained stable for the remaining months, and this fluctuation has become more pronounced since 2010. In addition, the number of reported AIDS cases has shown a significant upward trend over the past 14 years, and has increased by approximately 14.384% per year.",

            "text": "For the actual change curve and prediction curve of AIDS incidence from January 2017 to April 2018, see Figure 9 . MAPE is predicted to be 8.15%. The actual and predicted curves of AIDS incidence from January 2009 to January 2018 are shown in Figure 9 , of which the predicted MAPE is 8.21%. From the comparison of the results in Figure 9 and Figure 11 , it can be seen that the difference between the whole prediction curve and the actual curve is not big, and the whole prediction error is quite stable within one or ten years, without large deviation, which proves that the method in this paper is effective. Figure 10 shows the image of the training loss function of the AIDS incidence prediction model changing with the number of iterations. From the above figure, it can be seen that the MHPSO-GRU based AIDS incidence prediction model tends to be stable when the number of training reaches 400, and then the loss function value is close to 0.28, indicating that the prediction effect is better. Table 3 shows the prediction ability and efficiency of the four best fit models selected. We found that compared with MAE, MAPE, mer and RMSE, the fitting results of basic BPNN model were the lowest, so as to analyze the future epidemic mode of known cases of AIDS. In the out of sample prediction, AIDS had the maximum value of the above four indicators. The MHPSO-GRU model is considered to be the most suitable model for prediction in the derivative model based on the full consideration of the performance simulated and predicted by these models (Figure 11 and Figure 12 ). Subsequently, this hybrid approach was re established and data from the whole report were used to simulate the time behavior of AIDS in the near future. As can be seen from table 7, it shows that the disease seems to be on the rise from May 2018 to December 2020. Figure 11 shows the predicted incidence of AIDS by MHPSO-GRU model, LSTM model, RNN model and BPNN model. It can be seen that BPNN model has the worst prediction effect and the largest deviation from the actual data. The prediction error of RNN model is large, that of LSTM model is small, and that of MHPSO-GRU model is minimum. Figure 12 shows the global prediction of AIDS incidence by four algorithms: BPNN model, RNN model, LSTM model and MHPSO-GRU model. The blue line is the time sequence of actual incidence of AIDS, the red line is the prediction sequence of MHPSO-GRU model, the yellow line is the prediction sequence image of LSTM model, the purple line is the prediction sequence of RNN model, and the green line is the prediction sequence of BPNN model In addition to BPNN model, other models have good prediction effect, but MHPSO-GRU model has better prediction effect. As described above, the curve (solid red line) fitted by the MHPSO-GRU method can better approximate the reality (solid blue line) compared to other curves. Table 4 shows the prediction value and 95% prediction interval of 2018-2020 based on MHPSO-GRU model, and figure 13 shows the prediction value and prediction interval of 2018-2020. From the comprehensive table and figure, we can see that the incidence of AIDS in the future is still rising, and the situation of AIDS prevention and control is still very serious.",

Although the results of the first choice model are satisfactory, the actual impact of the model's accuracy before and after the sudden rise in incidence rate of AIDS is still unknown. Secondly, in the construction of RNN model, due to the lack of mature theoretical guidance on the optimal number of hidden cells, feedback delay and other key parameters. Although mhpso algorithm is used to improve the number of singular numbers in this paper, its specific simulation and prediction process is largely unknown. Third, it is estimated that 32.4% of AIDS patients in China do not know their infection status. Therefore, the actual situation may be more serious than the estimated situation. Fourthly, many complex factors, including unpredictable factors, may lead to the occurrence and spread of AIDS. The prediction model we built only relies on the known AIDS cases in the past, without considering other factors to predict the unknown cases. Therefore, if conditions permit, factors related to the occurrence and development of AIDS are expected to be used together to assess the epidemic. Finally, the prediction model is based on the cases in China from January 2004 to April 2018. Therefore, the analysis of the epidemic only represents the situation and trend of AIDS in the country. After being recorded, this method has great benefits for other regions and infectious diseases.",
