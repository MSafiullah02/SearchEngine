Salmonella enterica was detected from 29 samples [26 raccoons, 5.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8-3.5%; three masked palm civets, 2.0%, 95% CI 4.2-0%]. Many of the isolates belonged to serovars that are commonly isolated from human gastroenteritis patients (e.g. S. Infantis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Thompson). The antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that 26.9 % of the isolates from raccoons were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, whereas none of the isolates from masked palm civets were resistant.

Masked palm civets are thought to have been introduced into Japan, although this contention is controversial (Abe, 2005) .

Interestingly, six strains isolated from raccoons were identified as S. enterica subsp. diarizonae.

However, the other 14 isolates from both raccoons and masked palm civets could not be identified by the multiplex PCR assay. Additional biochemical tests suggested that these strains belonged to uncommon species of Campylobacter (Table 3) . As such species (e.g. C. hyointestinalis, C. larienae or C. rectus) are isolated from healthy animals and enteritis patients, their pathogenicity and epidemiology have not been well known (Vandamme et al., 2005) .

These results lead to the conclusion that these animals are potential reservoirs of the pathogens. The characteristics of the isolates showed that these animals probably acquired the pathogens from human activities, other wild animals, and the environment. The presence of human-associated serovars and the antimicrobial resistance of the Salmonella isolates revealed the effect of human activities on these animals. This represents a typical spill-over of pathogens from human activities to wildlife (Daszak et al., 2000) . Meanwhile, the carrying of pathogens which are usually isolated from wildlife or from the environment (e.g. S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and Y. pseudotuberculosis) indicated that these animals could play an important role in the life cycles of those bacteria in their habitats.
