            "text": "The Second Informal ASEAN Summit was scheduled for the end of 1997. In January 1997, Japan's prime minister Ryutaro\u0304 Hashimoto, during his visit to ASEAN countries, proposed holding an additional ASEAN-Japan Summit. 1 Prime minister Hashimoto sought ASEAN's support for Japan's crisis-hit economy in face of China's increasing economic and political power. 2 In response to Japan's proposal, ASEAN countries-attempting to avoid the negative consequences of disregarding the two powers of East Asia's north subregion-expressed their will to invite Chinese and South Korean representatives to attend the Summit. The formal decision in this matter, as well as with regard to the accession of CLM countries, was made at the end of May 1997. 3 The fi nal compromise reached by ASEAN countries resulted in holding three separate summits attended by each country of the North, and, separately, one common EAS (the decision was made at the Second ASEAN Informal Summit held from 14 to 16 December 1997) . It can be concluded that Hashimoto's doctrine-as planned by its creator-led to establishing ASEAN\u2212Japan Summits, but it also resulted in the APT First Summit (Tanaka 2007 ). 4 In this context, it is worth mentioning that ASEAN leaders decided to develop an outline for the structure of ASEAN+3 before the outbreak of the Asian fi nancial crisis. This is a signifi cant fact because cooperation in East Asia's entire territory was directly driven by political regionalism and security issues rather than by the intention to tighten economic links. However, the Asian crisis had a major impact on intensifying intraregional cooperation, justifying this form of mutual contacts. Consequently, in the context of the failure to establish the AMF (right after the outbreak of the crisis), and contrary to the original plans to focus the summit debates on diplomatic issues, the First APT Summit was dominated by discussions related to the rapidly deteriorating fi nancial crisis. However, apart from the fact that the Second Informal ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur proposed the ASEAN Vision 2020, it did not lead to any signifi cant resolutions or agreements adopted by a larger composition of participants extended by the ASEAN+3 structure. Simultaneously, the personal changes of government leaders in most East Asia's crisis-stricken countries 5 offered new opportunities for intraregional cooperation. 6 The Second APT Summit was held in Hanoi in December 1998, accompanying the Sixth ASEAN Summit. It was a breakthrough event in terms of APT's institutionalisation process. The participants decided to establish regular ASEAN+3 Summits, accompanying all ASEAN summits (offi cial and informal). In addition to that, Kim Dae-jung proposed establishing the East Asia Vision Group (EAVG)-a group composed of outstanding intellectuals from APT countries, acting as an ASEAN+3 group of advisors for creating long-term visions for the region's revitalisation and mutual economic cooperation. Relevant recommendations were to be presented at the Fifth APT Summit in 2001. Another step in the process of ASEAN+3's institutionalisation was a proposal made by Hu Jintao to hold meetings of East Asian fi nancial experts. 7 Simultaneously, Japan proposed establishing the New Miyazawa Initiative-fi nancial support offered to crisis-hit countries in the amount of USD 30 billion (see Sect. 2.3). However, the term \"ASEAN plus 3\" came into common use after the fi rst meeting of the vice-ministers of fi nance and representatives of APT central banks, held in March 1999 (during which a consent was given to monitoring short-term capital transfers) (Dent 2008 ).",

The objective proposed by Philippines-establishing a single market and a monetary union (with a single East Asian currency) as well as an East Asian Community-turned out to be premature, and it did not gain general support. 8 The Summit adopted a Declaration on cooperation in East Asia (APT 1999 ) . The document comprised two groups of commitments. The fi rst one referred to economic and social issues. ASEAN+3 countries made a commitment to engage in cooperation in six areas: economic issues, monetary and fi nancial matters, human resource and social development, culture and information, scientifi c and technological development and general development programmes. The other group was related to political and other relations. ASEAN+3 leaders decided to strengthen cooperation in resolving political, security and transnational issues with a view to increasing mutual understanding and fi nding common solutions to existing problems. They also agreed to intensify cooperation and increase coordination in relations with international organisations including the UN, the WTO, APEC and ASEM. Responsibility for implementing these commitments was vested in the hands of the foreign ministers of ASEAN+3 countries.",

Therefore, the Summit was followed by a series of ministerial meetings and the enlargement of the institution structure of ASEAN+3. It was clearly visible that cooperation referred mainly to economic and social issues, which was quite obvious in the context of the Asian crisis as well as historical and political antagonisms among member states (especially \"plus three\" countries). With regard to the \"antagonisms\", it should be stressed that the Third APT Summit was a breakthrough change in the relations among Northeast Asian countries, which held their fi rst three-party meeting. The concept proposed by Japan's prime minister Obuchi to hold separate meetings for the leaders of East Asia's three northern nations was approved by the remaining parties. Consequently, APT Summits contributed to future Japan-China-Korea meetings.",

            "text": "The Fourth APT Summit was held in Singapore in November 2000, parallel to the Fourth Informal ASEAN Summit. The leaders of \"plus three\" countries supported the Association's ASEAN Integration Initiative, expressing their intention to establish the Asian IT Belt, connecting East Asian cities. The representatives of China and Japan made a commitment to provide fi nancial support, while South Korea offered HR and IT training programmes and announced its participation in the e-ASEAN Framework Agreement, adopted by ASEAN countries at the Summit held in Singapore (ASEAN 2000a , b ) . These endeavours aimed to narrow economic gaps. It is worth a while to refer to the previously mentioned fact-during the Summit China's prime minister Rongji Zhu made a proposal to appoint a group of experts for strengthening economic cooperation and establishing an FTA. At the Fourth APT Summit, the leaders of ASEAN+3 countries supported Kim Dae-jung's proposal to establish the East Asia Study Group (EASG). It was to be composed of APT high ranking offi cials (one representative of each country) and the secretary general of ASEAN. EASG was implemented in March 2001, and it was assigned the task of preparing reports (to be submitted at the Sixth APT summit in November 2002) on two issues: an assessment of EAVG recommendations and an analysis of the impact of EASs on regional transformation processes (APT 2002 ) . 9 The East Asian Vision Group's report was submitted at the Fifth APT Summit held in Bandar Seri Begawan in November 2001. Its main objective was to outline a vision for the East Asian community, which would inspire the region's nations and governments. The implementation process was based on achieving fi ve goals: preventing confl icts and promoting peace in East Asia; supporting economic cooperation in trade, fi nance and investments; increasing common prosperity through cooperation in education and human resource development; strengthening inhabitants' security (through regional activities related to environmental protection and good governance) and promoting the East Asian Community's identity (APT 2001 ) . The report identifi ed fi ve cooperation areas. The fi rst one related to economic issues and focused on the following activities: facilitating trade in accordance with Bogor goals and establishing the East Asia Free Trade Area (EAFTA), establishing the East Asia Investment Area (EAIA) through implementing the Framework Agreement on AIA in the entire territory, supporting cooperation in technologies and economic development (especially in the least developed countries), creating knowledge-based economies and economies oriented on future economic structures (development of nanotechnology, biotechnology and IT), harmonising internet and e-trade applications (through protecting intellectual property rights). The second group of EAVG objectives related to fi nance. The Vision Group proposed implementing agreements on regional fi nancial self-help programmes and coordinating exchange rate mechanisms (to maintain fi nancial stability). It also recommended strengthening a regional monitoring and supervision system (in support of the global supervision exercised by the IMF). Also, a positive assessment was given to the Chiang Mai Initiative of May 2000.",

Simultaneously, ASEAN countries expressed their recognition of contributions made by the particular \"plus three\" countries. For example, Japan gained recognition for signing the ASEAN-Japan Declaration (December 2003) on a dynamic and lasting partnership in the new millennium (the Tokyo Declaration), commemorating the 30th anniversary of establishing the ASEAN\u2212Japan dialogue (and the adoption of the action plan).

The fi rst part was a review of the main stages of cooperation within ASEAN+3 in 1997\u22122007. 18 The second part presented a plan of further integration for 2007\u22122017. It reaffi rmed the role of the APT process as the major tool for developing the regional architecture aimed to create the East Asian Community (with ASEAN acting as the driving force of the process). The Declaration stressed the transparency, openness and future orientation of East Asian integration, as well as the complementary and supporting functions performed by other structures in the APT process (including APEC, ASEM, ARF and EAS). With a view to strengthening and rationalising ASEAN+3 cooperation, fi ve major areas of activity were identifi ed. The fi rst one comprised politics and security-closer dialogue and cooperation achieved as a result of regular meetings, the exchange of information and human resource management. The second area of activities referred to economic and fi nancial cooperation-stimulating economic growth and sustainable development aimed to ensure a free movement of goods, services, capital and people; supporting economic integration; ensuring free trade, its transparency, as well as the implementation of intellectual property rights; carrying out structural reforms and promoting mutual investment projects. With regard to the fi nancial sector, the Declaration recommended the multilateralisation of CMI (Chiang Mai Initiative) and the strengthening of ABMI. The third cooperation area identifi ed by ASEAN+3 for the subsequent decade comprised energy, the environment and climate change. The Declaration reaffi rmed the need for ensuring energy security (through diversifi ed supplies, increased energy effi ciency and new renewable sources of energy), counteracting the effects of climate change, and for seeking balance between sustainable economic development and social development. The fourth cooperation area within the ASEAN+3 framework comprised socio-cultural and development-related issues, focusing on the following activities: achieving the Millennium Development Goals, narrowing development gaps (through implementing VAP and IAI), and supporting subregional cooperation programmes as well as educational and cultural projects. The last cooperation area recommended by the leaders of ASEAN+3 countries related to institutional support mechanisms, including the APT Fund and the APT Unit in the ASEAN Secretariat (APT 2007b ).",

Firstly, ASEAN+3 is the actual implementation of the EAEG and EAEC vision. Secondly, the framework of ASEAN+3 meetings-from the perspective of their participants as well as diversifi ed economic and political dimensions-is a unique form of cooperation in the context of macroregional structures operating in other world regions. It leads to rivalry among \"plus three\" countries for dominance in the region, which is accompanied by ASEAN's endeavours to retain the \"10+3\" structure (instead of \"3+10\"). Therefore, the Association-in its efforts to strengthen the key position in the region and to develop its own subregion (fi nancially and technically supported by the northern countries, and parallel to agreements adopted by APT Summits)-continued holding bilateral meetings with East Asian countries. APT Summits made decisions related to strengthening bilateral decisions, with consideration given to the participants' individual political and economic goals. Therefore, it can be stated that ASEAN+3 countries were the most successful in the areas in which their individual goals overlapped as a result of crises: the fi nancial crisis in East Asia and the global food crisis. The most signifi cant achievements of APT included fi nancial integration, leading to the Chiang Mai Initiative (and its multilateralisation), and the establishment of the Asian Bond Market (Table 5 .1 ). Intensifi ed cooperation was also recorded in monetary markets, aimed to increase the signifi cance of regional currencies. 26 Another achievement of East Asian countries was the establishment of the permanent rice reserve system (EAERR), protecting the region against the effects of food crises and related political turbulences (as in the case of the Arab Spring). On the other hand, ASEAN member countries failed-within the framework of ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+1 (ASEAN-China)-to resolve territorial confl icts, especially South China Sea tensions (despite the repeated announcements, appeals and reminders).",

Contemporary Japan-a country founded on the principles of democracy and recognised as one of the countries of the West as an ally of the USA-was in a very uncomfortable situation in the context of the violation of the principles of democracy and the rule of law in East Asian countries, especially in Myanmar. 27 Japan's government found it diffi cult to implement its cautious policies with regard to the development of the Mekong River Basin in the context of its efforts to reduce the Chinese Communist Party's infl uence in Indochina (obviously, China's policy was determined by different factors). Simultaneously, ASEAN intended to act as East Asia's \"hub\" and, consequently, made attempts to balance \"plus three\"-ASEAN relations, supporting democratic changes in Myanmar. This process was enhanced by the provisions of the ASEAN Charter-Art. Twenty legal grounds for imposing restrictions on this country. In this context, a signifi cant role was played by the possibility of exerting infl uence on member states (despite ASEAN's adherence to TAC agreements).

The leaders of other countries were invited to attend the Association's summits, which ultimately led to the creation of another (apart from ASEAN+3) East Asian macroregional structure-the EAS. 28 The EAS inauguration meeting was also attended by the representatives of the Russian Federation as an observer. The structure of the EAS's membership was different than originally planned (limited to ASEAN+3). Secondly, a number of valid arguments were raised with regard to the identifi cation of the territory of East Asia and the possible achievement of EAS's long-term goal-establishing an East Asian Community. India, belonging to South Asia, and Australia and New Zealand as part of the Pacifi c region, were invited to attend the Malaysia Summit under the pressure of Indonesia, which made attempts to balance the growing power of China. On the other hand, some of East Asian countries, especially China and Malaysia, advocated a structure focused on regional needs and based on close cultural and social bonds. Eventually, a compromise was reached in May 2006, resulting in blocking EAS membership for at least two years. 29 The fi rst EAS adopted two documents. The fi rst one was the Kuala Lumpur Declaration on the EAS, in which the parties announced the official establishment of the EAS as a dialogue forum for strategic political and economic issues of mutual concern, aimed to foster peace, stability and economic prosperity (EAS 2005a ). The document stressed that EAS efforts aimed to build East Asia's community were to be consistent with the concept of an ASEAN Community, support this concept and constitute an integral part of the regional institutional architecture. The EAS was to act as an open, transparent and externally oriented forum aimed to support global and universally accepted principles, acknowledging ASEAN as the \"driving force\" of the process. Simultaneously, ASEAN was authorised to set EAS participation criteria. 30 The parties announced that EAS meetings would be held annually in a country holding the ASEAN Chair, accompanying ASEAN Summits. The Declaration stated that the EAS aimed to support development, fi nancial stability and energy security, narrow development gaps in East Asia and reduce poverty (through the development of infrastructure and technology transfers), develop and facilitate trade and investment, cooperate in solving political and security problems, support interpersonal contacts and cultural awareness, counteract the effects of natural disasters and prevent contagious diseases.",

They also referred to higher education, acknowledging the announcements of China, Australia and New Zealand to establish scholarship systems for students from EAS developing countries for 2011\u22122015. The Summit expressed the need for closer cooperation in the areas of energy, counteracting pandemics (H1N1) and disaster management (with attention given to cooperation in agriculture and developing rural areas). The participants called for intensifi ed efforts aimed to facilitate trade and investment movements in East Asia, expressing their determination to fi nalise the Doha Round. With regard to the still unstable global economic recovery, the leaders stated that EAS countries and their potential could play a more signifi cant role in an international arena (especially within G-20) in restoring global fi nancial stability and achieving sustained economic growth (EAS 2010b ).",

As the name indicated, the Declaration described principles for regulating EAS relations, being-to a large extent-an interpretation of the principles adopted by the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. The Bali Principles were based on the statements issued by EAS parties concerning such areas as mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, national identity, non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, rejection of the use or threat of violence in EAS mutual relations (in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations), and peaceful confl ict resolution. Also, the declaration recommended that the signatories respect principles related to international law, fundamental freedoms, human rights, social justice, partnership and good neighbourliness, as well as religious, ethnical and cultural diversity in EAS countries. Adopting the Bali Principles, EAS countries made a commitment to foster peace, stability and prosperity, to ensure the fl exibility of joint undertakings (especially with regard to economic shocks and natural disasters), and to support benefi cial cooperation within the EAS as well as in relations with other regional structures: ASEAN, ASEAN+1, ASEAN+3 and the ARM (EAS 2011a ).",

The signatories stated that increased intraregional connectivity would be benefi cial for all EAS parties (as the result of increased trade and investment, the development of infrastructure and the narrowing of development gaps), and decided to grant priority status to ASEAN connectivity as one of EAS goals. The EAS parties expressed their support for the effective and timely implementation of the Master Plan with regard to the previously mentioned connectivity dimensions (physical, institutional and interpersonal), stressing the signifi cance of two other dimensions: connectivity between continental Southeast Asia and the archipelagos, as well as subregional internal connectivity among ASEAN member states. EAS leaders, regarding ASEAN connectivity to be the fi rst stage of developing EAS connectivity, expressed their intention to support ASEAN connectivity by enhancing their resources, knowledge and exchange of information. Also, they announced carrying out activities in the following areas: increasing the awareness of the signifi cance of the process among private entrepreneurs and the public sector (conferences and workshops), supporting regional private-public partnerships in implementing the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (bilateral agreements and the use of regional and international funds), as well as promoting interpersonal contacts (continuous learning initiatives, education, tourism and cultural exchange).

It is confi rmed by a range of subjects discussed at the EAS forum (Table 5. 2 ), just to mention the 2011 Bali Summit, at which decisions related to regional economic cooperation clearly refl ected other forms of East Asian regional cooperation between ASEAN+3 and EAS (the concepts of EAFTA and CEPEA). Simultaneously, contrary to the expectations of the countries of East Asia's north subregion (especially China), EAS Summits were hosted by ASEAN nations (according to the rotation of the Chair of ASEAN). The particular meetings, on the other hand, were held shortly after ASEAN Summits. 37 As a result, China's interest in the EAS forum was not as great as in ASEAN+3. Moreover, the establishment of Jakarta-based ERIA-an institution focused on regional integration within the framework of ASEAN and the EAS, the fi rst institutional structure comprising 16 EAS member states-was another factor which shifted China's interests towards ASEAN+3. Simultaneously, ERIA was a concept initiated and fi nancially supported by Japan, which adopted a similar structure to OECD, thus constituting a source of competition for Beijing-based NEAT, established for the needs of ASEAN+3. 38 In conclusion, in the context of increasing Japan-China rivalry for the region's dominant position, the EAS became a forum which strengthened ASEAN's centrality in East Asia (similarly to ASEAN+3). This fact was refl ected in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 2005, in which the signatories recommended that ASEAN set EAS membership criteria. Moreover, a number of documents issued by the EAS reaffi rmed ASEAN's key role in creating regional institutional architecture, simultaneously acknowledging the signifi cant contribution of other entities to the EAS process. In particular, it applied to ASEAN+3, ASEAN+1 as well as transregional (e.g. APEC) and interregional structures (ARF).",

These changes were accelerated by the visible marginalisation of Japan by its major ally-the USA, accompanied by considerable improvements in US-China relations. From 27 October to 3 November 1997, China's president Jiang Zemin paid a visit to the USA at the invitation of US president Clinton (the fi rst visit in 12 years). China was revisited by the president Clinton from 25 June to 3 July 1998. During the visit, the US president said he \"did not support independence for Taiwan\" (this statement was criticised by the US Senate Resolution of 7 July 1998). Moreover, the US president did not consider a visit to Japan during his nine-day visit to China, and he even criticised Japan's government for mismanaging its economy. This fact, in the context of the US government's opposition to Japan's proposal to establish the AMF, considerably weakened the position of the world's second largest economy in an international arena and, in particular, in the East Asian region. Therefore, Japan's activities within ASEAN+3 as part of its diplomatic efforts aimed to strengthen this country's international position (moreover, the Communist Party of China reduced the signifi cance of the Second ASEAN+3 Summit by the participation in the event of its vice president Hu Jintao, while Japan was represented by prime minister Obuchi (Cossa 1998 ; Tanaka The proposal was turned down in favour of Philippines, an ASEAN member state, reducing China's interest in the EAS forum.

The concept was proposed by Philippine president Joseph Estrada. At that time, the introduction of a single currency in East Asia was supported by Joseph Yam (head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, HKMA). Hong Kong made endeavours to establish a monetary union with Singapore. The idea of introducing an \"Asian euro\" was also supported by Robert Mundell-a creator of the theory of optimum currency areas (Gilson 2006 ; Ravenhill 2006 ; Pomfret 2011 ). 9. Attention should be given to visible similarities between EAVG and EASG concepts for the needs of a vision for APEC's development, created in the early 1990s by the Eminent Persons Group. The 26. The decision made in April 2012 concerning the direct exchange of Japanese and Chinese currencies. The JPY-RMB exchange (without using the US dollar as an intermediary currency) was aimed to increase mutual trade and investment, contributing to the internationalisation of both currencies. 27. For this reason, Japan's assistance offered to Indochina targeted CLV, not CLMV. Myanmar became one of the benefi ciaries of the Japanese aid programme as late as in 2011, following the commencement of democratic changes in this country. During the ASEAN\u2212Japan Summit in November 2011, Japan expressed satisfaction over Myanmar's presidency in ASEAN planned for 2014. 28. Because of EAS members, the structure was also referred to as ASEAN+6. 29. Full membership status in the EAS was applied for by the Russian Federation (strongly supported by China), Mongolia and Pakistan (supported by Malaysia) as well as Papua New Guinea (recommended by Australia). The European Union applied for observer status, while the USA expressed intention to attend EAS meetings without specifying a status of its participation (Dent 2008 ). 30. The Kuala Lumpur Declaration concerning ASEAN's approval of full membership in the EAS specifi ed three criteria: holding ASEAN Partner Dialogue status, the adoption of TAC, and a signifi cant contribution to the region's economic development (Frost 2008 ). 31. As the result of urban processes, city population is expected to double by 2030 as compared with 2000, when cities were inhabited by 1.7 billion Asians (EAS 2007c ). 32. In 2009, the region was hit by a number of natural disasters: tropical storm Nangka in June, leading to fl oods, landslides and tornados in central Philippines; the earthquake of 2 September in Indonesia (the province of West Java) and devastating typhoon Ketsana, which hit large territories in Southeast Asia, leading to fl oods in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. In May 2008, Myanmar was hit by cyclone Nargis, causing huge losses and gigantic fl oods (the number of deaths was estimated at 200,000, while 800,000 inhabitants were relocated) (Roberts 2010 ). 33. The Statement was issued by Vejjajiva Abhisit, the prime minister of Thailand-the country which chaired ASEAN in 2009 and coordinated the East Asia Summit. 34. It should be noted that the Fourth East Asia Summit supported India's initiative to re-open the University of Nalanda-an ancient Buddhist site of learning in the Indian State of Bihar. The University operated from the fi fth to the twelfth century, offering programmes in mathematics, philosophy, medicine and astronomy to the inhabitants of East and South Asia. The idea to revive the University was initiated in 2007 by the Nalanda Mentor Group, headed by Indian economist Amartya Sen. The University, in accordance with a statement issued at the Fourth East Asia Summit, was to act as a non-governmental, non-profi t and self-governing organisation-a centre for educating Asia's most gifted students (EAS 2009d ). 35. It should be stressed that the Fifth EAS Summit in 2010 was attended by the representatives of the two countries: Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 36. EAS new member states were represented by US president Barak Obama and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. The Summit announced possible participation of the president of ADB and the UN Secretary General. 37. However, China made a proposal to host the Second EAS Summit.",
