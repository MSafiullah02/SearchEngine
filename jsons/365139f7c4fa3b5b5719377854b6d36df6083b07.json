Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/overestimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots.

When first proposed for tracking of SARS-CoV-2, the prevailing scientific opinion was that the virus may be shed into wastewater at insufficiently high rates, and that both the virus itself and its RNA may be too labile to facilitate detection in wastewater. Recent reports of coronavirus shedding in human stool (Gao et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Jiehao et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; 2020c; 2020d; 2020e) and three preliminary reports of successful SARS-CoV-2 detection in municipal wastewater from the Netherlands the United States and Australia have dispelled some of these concerns (Ahmed 2020, Lodder 2020, Medema et al. 2020 , Wu et al. 2020 ).

Better population-wide data could aid in reducing the economic damage and social burden placed on populations dealing with stay-at-home ordinances, furlough and involuntary unemployment.

At present, reliable data are lacking for loss of SARS-CoV-2 from insewer degradation under any temperature regime. However, a prior study conducted byGundy et al. (2009) on a different coronavirus strain can serve to provide an approximate benchmark value for virus decay kinetics. According to equation 1, and assuming 0 = 100, ( ) = 0.1, time = 48-72 hours(Gundy et al., 2009) as well as first-order kinetics, the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 at ambient conditions (20\u00b0C) can be estimated to range between approximately 4.8 and 7.2 hours", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "temperature plays in the degradation of biomarkers can lead to the propagation of error into estimates of upstream discharge, consumption, exposure, and excretion(Hart and Halden, 2020a). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is no exception to this rule. Ignoring temperature effects puts decision-makers at risk of misjudging the public health status and of over-or under-reacting in the selection and implementation of infectious disease control interventions. The effects of temperature adjustment are magnified for longer in-sewer travel times; however, they are evident J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 in some form at every real-world in-sewer travel time(Figure 2, panel C). WBE studies which do not adjust their monitoring results to temperature will risk significant under-or over-estimation of the true temporal changes occurring in virus shedding within the community(Figure 2, panel D).

Annual temperature swings were most pronounced for the city of Detroit, USA and least J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 pronounced but still notable for the cities of Tempe and New Orleans, USA. Application of the average estimated half-life of 5.95 hours calculated in Table 1 and use of the kinetic rate of transformation adjusted according to the Q 10 rule (equations 2 and 3), enabled the calculation of the maximum time a virus load can spend in the sewer line on route to the sampling location before it falls below the estimated limit of detection of qRT PCR. The latter was based conservatively on a loading of 600,000 viral genomes/mL feces (Zhang et al., 2020e) and a wastewater generation rate of 370 L/person/d (Figure 3). Accordingly, low temperatures of wastewater of the city of Detroit, USA in the winter would enable detection of the virus target even after almost 100 hours of in-sewer travel time; however, in the summer the tolerable duration would be reduced down to 20 hours. Whereas temperature-related swings in the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 were much less pronounced in Madrid, Spain and Tempe, USA, the relatively higher water temperatures (when compared to Detroit, USA) result in maximum travel times prior to loss of signal of 38 hours or less in both locations (Figure 3).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "in the northern hemisphere can result in under-estimates of COVID-19 prevalence in communities. The impact of failing to account for wastewater temperature in back-calculating upstream health metrics increases during the summer and with longer in-sewer travel times this is illustrated by different loading scenarios and travel times that would be required in order to observe a constant theoretical signal of 100 million virus genomes per unit time passing through the centralized monitoring location in the various COVID-19-impacted cities. A continued observation of the same viral counts in May, June, July, and August as were seen in January, February, and early March would suggest that the case load is stable and the epidemic reasonably managed. However, when taking temperature changes into account, model predictions show that the number of infected individuals actually must have tripled during that time period (300% increase;Figure 4; Wuhan and Tempe). This is magnified by the residence time of the virus in the sewer (i.e., the spatial distribution of infected and healthy individuals within a sewershed), which remains a large source of uncertainty in WBE.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": ", the model-simulated in-sewer travel time is mapped to the nearest building footprint using an actual, as-built, city sewer network.

In contrast, all of Germany's 9,636 wastewater treatment plants could easily be sampled and analyzed within 24 to 48 hours, due to the country's favorable transportation and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 16 testing infrastructure, at a cost for reagents alone of only $145,000 USD. In this case, the cost for WBE surveillance reagents would constitute only 0.014% of those required for clinical testing of individuals. This implies that testing this nation's wastewater millions of times over again would still be cheaper than a single screening of all people individually. For both speed and economy, these order-of-magnitude cost estimates heavily favor WBE over clinical screening for population health assessment. Similarly, about 70% of the US population could be screened for SARS-CoV-2 community spread by analyzing in 48 hours all 15,014 wastewater treatment plants at an estimated reagent cost of approximately $225,000 USD. The US currently still has limited clinical testing capacity, rendering individual screening of the 330 million population impractical. In addition, this approach would be too slow and cost-prohibitive, with clinical screening of all Americans leading to reagent costs alone of some $3.5 billion USD per sampling event. Even if the cost of reagents for clinical screening could be reduced by 99% in the future (e.g., through the introduction of paper-based assays) (Mao et al. 2020), the associated costs and logistical challenges still would render this approach questionable and unresponsive to the need of retesting a population to learn about new and repeated infections.For rapidly and repeatedly obtaining a health profile of billions of people around the world, the economy, speed and versatility of the WBE approach thus is difficult to match or surpass.

To accelerate the global economic recovery, it is desirable to implement restrictions to people's mobility and livelihoods only in locales where these are needed. WBE is well positioned to inform this local decision-making process. WBE also appears to constitute the only viable means of enabling large-scale population-wide testing globally, particularly in resource poor regions. Since effective use of large-scale WBE requires access to wastewater that is centrally collected, composited and treated, the global use of WBE relying on sampling of wastewater treatment plants currently is restricted to about 2.1 billion people or 27% of the global population.
