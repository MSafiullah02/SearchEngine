The Italian government promptly reacted by establishing two \u201cred zones\u201d where stringent measures to contain the epidemic were introduced from the 24th of February. These measures included quarantining of the areas, imposing strict restrictions of people movements and the temporary closure of schools, shops and industrial activities. On the 8th of March the government decided to extend these extraordinary measures to all Lombardy and neighbouring provinces, and eventually to the whole country on the 11th of March 2020.  In both instances, the implementation started the day after of the governmental decrees. The Italian Government subsequently took additional measures to further restrict people movement, travel, non-essential industrial activities and social interactions [1].",

The Covid-19 CI was described by a compartment model [3] quantified by a system of ordinary differential equations. This model takes into account the presence of asymptomatic cases. In addition, it incorporates the effect of the governmental interventions by allowing the reproductive number Ro to decrease over time since the start of the government intervention. We also estimated the evolution of the epidemic under the assumption of no government intervention by assuming a constant Ro. In both cases, a Bayesian approach was built, allowing to take into account a priori information about relevant variables, e.g. incubation time.  This also provides both a more robust estimation and confidence intervals. Statistical inference on the unknown model parameters was drawn by means of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations [4].",

In Fig. 1a we present both the observed Covid-19 CI and the modelled Covid-19 CI curve using the logistic setting. The highest Covid-19 CI, normalised for 1000 inhabitants, was observed in Lombardy, followed by Emilia-Romagna and Veneto.

These results indicate that the time lag between the introduction of the government measures, the 9th and 12th of March, and the peaking of the Covid-19 CI growth rate was between 13 and 15 days. The analyses of the curves of these six regions also indicate that at the time the government measures were introduced, the epidemic was at very different stages across these regions. The evolution of the epidemic curves suggests that the government measures achieved a reduction and a eventually a peaking of the Covid-19 CI growth rate both in the Northern Italian regions, where the epidemic was already rampant around the 9\u201311 March, as well as in central and southern Italy where the epidemic curve was still low at that time. The results also suggest that the government measures may have prevented the Covid-19 epidemic in central and southern regions to rise to the high levels that were already occurring in the North.",

In Fig. 3a we report the results for Lombardy, as the region where the epidemic reached by far the highest Covid-19 CI. The figure shows that the model follows closely the observed Covid-19 CI data. Furthermore, our results indicate that the Covid-19 CI progressively diverged toward values lower than the ones expected by the projected evolution of the epidemic in the absence of government measures. The two curves started to separate approximately 7\u201310 days after the implementation in Lombardy of the government measures the 9th of March 2020. This estimated time interval is in line with the one obtained as the sum of the 5 days median interval between infection and symptoms [5] and the 4 days median interval between onset of symptoms and diagnoses as reported in Italy [6].",
