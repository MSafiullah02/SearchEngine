Since its discovery in 2004 [1] , graphene has rapidly emerged as a family of highly promising nanomaterials with unique electronic, optical and catalytic properties that can be exploited for numerous applications in energy, environment, and biomedicine. In particular, the coupling of graphene with biology brings exciting research focuses. Due to their large surface areas, superior physical and chemical properties, graphene-based nanomaterials has emerged as an attractive candidate to act as nanoscale building blocks for biological researches. The strong van der Waals force between graphene nanosheets facilitate incorporating molecules or nanomaterials (e.g., polymer or nanoparticles) to form multifunctional nanocomposites, which is effective to improve their properties and enhance their performance toward biosystems. In addition, based on their inherent antibacterial properties, graphene can be used as a new effective and green antibacterial agent with a severe cell inactivation toward bacteria. Also importantly, graphenebased nanomaterial is renewable and easy to fabricate with low cost and fast preparation techniques, compared to traditional metals and metal oxides. The research ranges from fundamental studies on the interactions between graphene and biomolecules to various graphenebased practical applications including antibacterial materials, cell culture substrates, biosensors and drug delivery carriers. While several excellent reviews have appeared with the focus on some of these topics [2] [3] [4] [5] , there has not been a comprehensive review that summarizes the research progress in graphene-based nanomaterials in biosystems.",

            "text": "Graphene, a two-dimensional layer of sp 2 -hybridized single-atomscale carbon, has caught appreciable attention due to its extraordinary intrinsic strength, high surface area, fast electron mobility, high thermal conductivity, and strong Young's modulus. Each carbon atom in the lattice has the s, px, and py atomic orbitals that hybridize to form covalent sp 2 bonds, which gives rise to C-C-C bond angles of 120\u00b0 and the chicken-wire-like layers. In the hexagonal ring, three valence electrons on each carbon in the lattice form the \u03c3 bond, which makes carbon atoms bonded together. A \u03c0 orbital known as the valence band, is formed by the remaining pz orbital on each carbon atom overlaps with its neighbors. The \u03c0 orbital is also called the conduction band that contributes to delocalized electrons. Graphene-based nanomaterials contain not only \"pristine\" graphene, but also chemical modified graphene as graphene derivatives that have been treated by chemical modifications [6] for covalent bonding with pendent groups, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). GO contains epoxy and carbon radicals in the basal planes, while its edges are decorated with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The amount of oxygen groups depends significantly on the preparation approaches, including direct oxidation of graphite and subsequent exfoliation of carbon sheets that are deeply oxidized. The intrinsic properties of graphene make that GO can partly be reduced going toward graphene-like sheets, which is generally referred as rGO. Chemical doping is another effective approach to synthesize doped-graphene, which is used to tailor the nature of graphene. In doped graphene, other elements, such as nitrogen atoms, boron atoms, and sulfur atoms, are introduced into the hexagonal lattice of graphene and replace the carbon atoms. Usually, the doped-atoms are under 10% of the whole system. Except modifying the natural properties of graphene, the morphologies can also be shaped, such as two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanosheets (GNSs) [1] , zero-dimensional (0D) graphene quantum dots (GQDs) [7] , and one-dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) [8] .",

Currently, there are several improved techniques to Hummer oxidation by using different oxidizing agents/acids or under different reaction conditions. Ruoff et al. [18] prepared a free-standing GO paper by flow-directed assembly method, possessing higher tensile modulus and fracture strength than many other paper-like materials. Marcano et al. [19] improved Hummer's methods by elimination NaNO3, increasing the concentration of KMnO4, and using a mixture of H2SO4/H3PO4, which obtained a high oxidized GO with free generation of toxic gases (NOx). rGO can be obtained by chemical or thermal reduction treatments heated above 100 \u00b0C using reducing agents, such as hydrazine, hydrogen, etc. Li et al. [20] reduced GO dispersions to stable graphene colloids via hydrazine reduction under controlled conditions, which provided a simple method to prepare single-layer chemical converted graphene sheets with thickness of ~ 1 nm. Recently, Chhowalla's group [21] further simplified the method to reduce GO into rGO by using few seconds long microwave pulses. The microwave-reduced GO showed CVD graphene-like Raman features, as well as atomic-scale highly ordered structures.",

            "text": "Up until now, some experimental studies regarding the absorption and desorption mechanisms between graphene and nucleic acids have been reported. Mann and co-workers [54] reported a method of utilizing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to prepare stable aqueous graphene suspensions sheets, which proposed a surface binding model for ssDNA/graphene interactions via non-covalent hydrophobic and electrostatic/hydrogen bonding between purine/pyrimidine bases of ssDNA and the carboxylic and phenolic groups of graphene. In general, the binding affinity between graphene and ssDNA via noncovalent interactions (i.e., \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions and hydrophobic forces) is much higher than those between graphene and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or tertiary DNA structures. Chen and co-workers [55] demonstrated that GO could bind dyelabeled ssDNA and quench its fluorescence, where GO has lower affinity for dsDNA than for ssDNA. Fan et al. [56] developed a GO-based multicolor fluorescent DNA analysis and performed a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation to study the interaction differences between ssDNA and dsDNA with GO. As a result, the nucleobases of ssDNA lay nearly flat on the GO surface that led to the strong absorption by GO. Such interaction was ascribed to the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between its nucleobases and hexagonal rings of GO. Whereas, the nucleobases of dsDNA in helical structure were shielded, so that GO could not stably adsorb it ( Fig. 3(a) ). Li's group [57] constructed graphene-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) aptasensor for detection of thrombin by assembling FAM-labeled aptamer on graphene. When thrombin was introduced, it caused the conformational change of aptamer that induced the recovery of fluorescence ( Fig. 3(b) ). Liu and Maheshwari et al. [58] reported the binding efficiency of DNA to GO surface depends on DNA length, salt, pH, solvent, and temperature. As reported, short DNA strands usually had faster kinetics and higher adsorption efficiency than long DNA strands. Also, higher salt concentration, lower pH value, and additional organic solvent facilitated the absorption of DNA on GO.",

Owing to the superior physiochemical properties, graphene-based nanomaterials have been focused on the biological responses of viruses, including the capture and destruction, attachment inhibition, and detection of viruses. Min et al. [85] developed a multiplexed GO-based helicase assay (mGOHA) based on GO to screen viral enzymes: inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase and severe acute respirator syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) helicase. As a result, 22 inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase, 26 of SARS CoV helicase and 24 of both helicases was discovered from a 10,000 small molecule library. Wang and Tang et al. [86] demonstrated that GO could act as a label-free material for detection and disinfection of enteric viruses: EV71 and H9N2. GO can effectively interact with viruses, as well as significantly improve the destruction, removal and disinfection that achieved at least 6-log inactivation. Gedanken and Sarid et al. [87] prepared sulfonated magnetic nanoparticles functionalized reduced graphene oxide (SMRGO) to capture and photothermally destroy herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). They found that SMRGO could be served as an effective antiviral agent (~ 99.99%) with a short capture time of 7 min. Gadanken et al. [88] reported that HSV-1 infections were inhibited by GO and partially reduced sulfonated GO (rGO-SO3) via a competitive inhibition mechanism. Recently, Adeli and Haag et al. [89] synthesized highly active functionalized graphene sheets containing 6% graphene and 94% sulfated polyglycerol, which are able to trap 20 virions by individual sheets with the size of ~ 1 \uf06dm \u00d7 1 \uf06dm.",

Graphene paper have provided an ideal platform for the growth and proliferation of the mouse fibroblast cell line (L-929) [93] . Likewise, graphene also serves as a preconcentration platform for osteogenic inducers for stem cell differentiation [94] . Studies also suggest that graphene-based nanomaterials treated by macromolecules exhibited good biocompatibility. Recent study [95] revealed that pristine graphene improved cell adhesion and proliferation, but it exhibits no influence on cell stress for both nonneuronal and neuronal cells, such as the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), the morphology and the autophagy levels. The functionalization of artificial peroxidase and extracellular matrix protein on graphene surface could improve the adhesion/growth capability of MCF-7 cells [96] . Both experimental observations and MD simulations showed that GO substrates treated by a mild thermal annealing process promoted the capture of Class II MHC-positive cell induced by oxygen clustering [97] . Besides acting as a good substrate, graphene has been designed as hybrid scaffold for tissue engineering applications. Fox example, the graphene-nanofiber hybrid scaffold by coating different amount of GO on the polymeric nanofiber (polycaprol actone) could cause selective differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), wherein a higher amount of GO facilitated cell differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes ( Fig. 4(a) ) [98] . Furthermore, a 3D GO/polymer hydrogel [99] served as an active cell scaffold for reversible cell capture triggered by near-infrared (NIR) light. Custom made 3D graphene micropatterns fabricated by a LightScribe DVD writer were used as scaffolds for guiding neuronal cell alignment [100] .",

However, another study indicated that GO could induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human lung cancer cells (BEAS-2B cell lines) [104] . Interestingly, when GO was coated with fetal bovine serum (FBS), it could greatly mitigate the cytotoxicity against A549 cells and eliminate cell membrane damage.

Consequently, the caspase 3 were activated and the apoptosis was initiated.

The GO-induced autophagy was regulated by the TLRs signaling pathway which was associated with downstream adaptor proteins MyD88, TRIF and TRAF6. Furthermore, Mokhir et al.

Under normal physiological conditions, cytochrome c (cyt c) was located on the inner membrane of mitochondria, and H2O2 was decomposed to \u00b7OH catalyzed by GO/PP to a minimum which exerted no harmful effects on C. elegans. Under stress conditions, GO-mediated production of \u00b7OH and cyt c/H2O2 electron transfer may occur simultaneously. Since the over production of H2O2 was triggered by oxidative and thermal condition, the accelerating effects of GO/PP on \u00b7OH generation were significantly improved. Moreover, cyt c provided chance for GO/PP to direct interact with it. GO/PP elevated and accelerated the electron transfer between cyt c and H2O2, as well as destroyed the inherent antioxidant defense system, eventually leading to apparent toxicity to worms.",

Surface modified graphene-based nanomaterials with improved dispersion and stability significantly mediated biodistribution and translocation of graphene in organs. For instance, PEGylated nGO mainly accumulated in liver and spleen that were excreted by renal and fecal clearance [118] , in which the PEG coating could decrease the retention of nGO in RES and promote the clearance of nGO from the organs [119] . Similarly, GO-dextran (GO-DEX) conjugate was also trapped in RES organs including liver and spleen, which showed clearance from the blood without apparent short-term toxicity in treated mice [120] . PEGylated GO derivatives exhibited no clear tissue uptake via oral administration, but high accumulation in RES including liver and spleen after intraperitoneal injection [121] . Unlike PEGylated GO, PEGylated rGO was distributed on major organs such as liver, spleen, kidney and brain after intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. Repeated administration of PEGylated rGO could cause severe liver injury, congestion in kidney and enhanced proliferation of splenocytes ( Fig. 5(b) ) [122] . Moreover, a carboxylated photoluminescent GQD prepared from carbon fiber show no acute toxicity or morphological changes, most of which accumulated in liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and tumor sites at 24 h after intravenous injection [123] . Finally, GQDs did not induced accumulation in major organs possibly due to the metabolism through kidneys, as well as no obvious in vivo toxicities due to the ultrasmall size and high oxygen content of GQD [102] .",

In vivo toxicological study revealed that multifunctional graphene with fluorescence and magnetic properties did not cause any significant abnormalities nor influence the survival rate of zebrafish. In vivo whole-animal imaging confirmed that multifunctional graphene co-localized and evenly biodistributed from the head to tail in zebrafish [125] . The toxicity of GO and PEGylated poly-L-lysine (GO/PP) functionalized GO were explored under stress conditions using a simple animal model, C. elegans worm. The results showed that GO/PP facilitated the electron transfer that impaired the inherent antioxidant defense system, and eventually triggered nanotoxicity to worms [116] . Graphene-TiO2 composite film could inactivate the C. elegans nematodes under solar light irradiation with concentration-dependency, implying the application in destruction of minuscule animals on biological environments [126] . Long-term toxicity of rGO nanosheets on female mouse reproductive performance and offspring development was investigated [127] . The results showed that rGO did not significantly change the sex hormone level of adult female mice. After intravenous injection, mouse dams achieved normal pregnancies and produce healthy offsprings before pregnancy or at an early gestational stage, whereas all surviving mice had abortions if they were injected with low or medium doses at a late stage of gestational. Besides toxic effects on animals, GO demonstrated lateral size-dependent effects in the induction of inflammatory responses in mice [128] . Larger GO sheets showed a plasma membrane adsorption and gave more production of inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of immune cells, whereas smaller GO sheets were prone to be taken up by macrophages (Fig. 5(c) ).",

            "text": "Similar to other inorganic nanomaterials, graphene has also been challenged by toxicological concerns in regard to its potential biomedical applications. There are several inevitable issues should be taken into account in graphene toxicology, such as valid amount, toxicity criteria, irreversible/reversible toxic effect, and joint toxicity. First of all, the target dose is a direct and valid concentration in the biological response studies in the detailed experiments; unfortunately, numerous studies have used exposure dose to represent concentration-bioresponse relationships, which resulted in a false relevance for cytotoxic effects. On the other hand, current acceptance criteria for toxicity tests are unknown. In spite of certain inconsistencies in some experimental results and hypotheses of the toxicity mechanisms, a wealth of reports agree that physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials significantly affect the toxicological responses, such as sizes, charges, coatings, and structural defects of graphene. To compare the nanotoxicity obtained under different conditions, an acceptance criterion for toxicity tests, including choice of statistical assumptions, statistical procedures, or set of experimental conditions, is necessary. Also, a long-term test upon multiple administrations to evaluate the risks of graphene is lacking. Despite many studies reported in vivo behaviors, the irreversible/reversible toxic effects of graphene are unclear because the acute toxic assays often ignored the reversible or delayed effects upon target organs. Last but not least, the literatures have been reported that joint toxicity is greatly different from single toxicity [134, 135] . Synergistic effects can occur between metal ions, organic materials, or biomolecules with graphene. And so the concern of joint toxicity should be paid enough attention, avoiding overestimation or underestimation the graphene toxicity. whose antibacterial activities are caused by physical damages or chemical effects. Huang and Fan et al. [136] first reported the antibacterial activity of GO and rGO nanosheets ( Fig. 6(a) ). After treatment with 85 g/mL GO/rGO for 2 h, the growth of E. coli was almost completely suppressed, with a viability loss up to > 90%. Moreover, macroscopic freestanding GO/rGO paper made by vacuum filtration also exhibited the superior antibacterial effect, which could open up new opportunities for developing antibacterial material. Akhavan et al. [137] studied the bacterial toxicity of graphene nanowalls (GONWs) prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and reduced graphene nanowalls (RGNWs) obtained by hydrazine reduction. Both GONWs and RGNWs exhibited bacterial cytotoxicity to Gram-negative E. Coli bacteria and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria. In particular, RGNWs exhibited higher antibacterial activity than GONW because of more sharp edges of the nanowalls leading to more cell membrane damage of the bacteria (Fig. 6(b) ). Chen and co-workers [138] compared the bacterial toxicity of graphite (Gt), graphite oxide (GtO), GO and rGO using E. coli as a bacterial model. Under the same conditions, GO exhibited the highest antibacterial activities, followed by rGO, graphite, and GtO (Fig. 6(c) ). Besides the antibacterial activities described above, the investigations of GO against dental pathogens has also been reported by Tang et al. [139] . Three typical dental bacterial, including S. mutans, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, were chosen to estimate the bacterial toxicity of nGO sheets. It was clearly confirmed that GO showed prominent antibacterial effect toward dental bacterial by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduced assay, colony forming units [136] , [137] , [138] , [139] , [143] , and [153] , \u00a9 American Chemical Society 2010, 2010, 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2018, respectively.

The size of GO sheet was a main factor influencing graphene's antibacterial activity. GO sheet with a larger size induced higher antibacterial activity than do smaller one [140, 141] , either induced by direct insertion or cutting [137, 141] or lipid extraction of phospholipids [141] on treatment with graphene nanosheets. On the contrary, Elimelech et al. found that the cell inactivation of GO with surface coatings increased by 4 times as the average area of GO decreased from 0.65 to 0.01 m 2 . It was mediated via oxidative mechanisms because of intensive defects in smaller GO sheets [142] . The source material and bacterial shape were also associated with antibacterial properties of graphene. It was reported that [143] GQDs prepared from GO sheets (GO-GQDs) did not show antibacterial ability, whereas GQDs synthesized by rupturing C60 cage (C60-GQDs) could effectively eliminate S. aureus, but not other three bacteria, Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). It seemed that surface Gaussian-curvature match between a GQD and a bacterium membrane might determine whether GQD cause the damaging the integrity of bacterial cell envelope (Fig. 6(e) ). The doping of nitrogen (N) was considered to be a useful method to improve the properties of GQDs. A recent study showed that N-doped GQD could generate more ROS than N-free GQD, implying enhanced antibacterial activities [144] . Other than the intrinsic properties of graphene-based nanomaterials, studies also revealed GO killed bacteria in concentration-and time-dependent manners [140] .",

Ag + treatment resulted in the detachment of cytoplasm membrane from the cell wall for E. coli and S. aureus and inactivated DNA replication and protein [145] . Gelatinous AgNPs with a diameter less than 10 nm effectively killed different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Unfortunately, bare AgNPs aggregated when they directly interact with bacteria. To alleviate this issue, Ag-graphene nanocomposites have been synthesized via different reducing agents, like NaBH4 [146] , hydrazine [138] , and dopamine [147] , etc. As-prepared Ag-rGO nanohybrid displayed surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and high disinfection activities [148, 149] . Ag-rGO nanocomposites also could be prepared without additional reducing agents, which showed enhanced antibacterial ability likely caused by the synergistic effect of \"capturing-killing process\", but no tolerable edema and/or erythema in skin irritation test [150] . Tan et al. develop a new method by using DNA as a template to prepare metal NPs and GO composites with controllable size and shape [151, 152] . Among the as-synthesized nanocomposites, 20 ppm Ag(18nm)@dsDNA@GO and 16 ppm Ag(5nm)@dsDNA@GO composites showed optimal antimicrobial capability towards a model plant bacterium Xanthomon asperforans due to the synergistic effect between AgNPs and GO [151] . He et al. prepared graphene-AgNPs-Si nanohybrids (G@AgNPs@Si) as a multifunctional SERS platform, allowing for molecular to cellular detection. In particular, it was utilized for capturing, discriminating, and inactivating of E. coli and S. aureus bacteria with strong antibacterial rate of ~ 93% after incubation for 24 h (Fig. 6(f) ) [153] . In addition, copper, gold and lanthanum has also been anchored on graphene to kill bacteria [154] [155] [156] .",

In the TEM experiments and MD simulations, it was both clearly observed two kinds of molecular mechanism: direct insertion/cutting mode and destructive lipid extraction mode (Fig. 7) . The vigorous extraction of phospholipids from the lipid bilayers was first discovered in MD simulations, which was further verified by typical TEM images. The strong attraction between graphene and lipid molecules was mostly generated from unique 2D carbons with sp 2 -bonded structures, promoting unexpected strong dispersion interactions between them. Both insertion and extraction could cause severe membrane stress, leading to the degradation of the bacterial membrane and then the reduction of bacterial viability.",

Li et al. [162] revealed that few-layered graphene flake started with Brownian motion, followed by spontaneous piercing of the membrane with its sharp corners or protrusions at edges, eventually achieving complete penetration into the membranes. While the previous studies have revealed that graphene surfaces with an orientation of 90\u00b0 [136, 138, 140] were effective for cell inactivation, Pham et al. [163] found that graphene surfaces with a 37\u00b0 orientation has the best efficiency to kill bacteria. It is also found that the density of graphene edges served as a crucial parameter in the determination of antimicrobial behavior. Moreover, some theoretical analysis has proposed the nearperpendicular penetration as another interaction mode between graphene and cell membrane. Yi and Gao [164] found that graphene sheets in a size-dependent manner would adopt a near-perpendicular configuration or a parallel attachment onto a membrane surface, where the membrane splay and tension energies acted as the main driving force. The inconsistent modes, however, were proposed by Dallavelle et al. [165] . They reported that smaller graphene sheets were more freely to pierce through transmembrane, while larger ones lay mainly flat on the surface of bilayers where wreak havoc was created with lipophilic membranes and formed a patch of upturned phospholipids with their tails direct contact with the graphene sheet.",

The elevated ROS level makes cell reach an oxidative state, and further lead to the damage or inactivation to cellular substrates, e.g., proteins, DNA, and lipids, followed by dysfunction of the mitochondria, disintegration of cell membrane, and ultimate cell death by apoptosis or necrosis [171] . In the ROS-dependent pathway, antioxidant compounds, like glutathione (GSH), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) [172] , \u03b1-tocopherol [173] , and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate [103, 174] can be oxidized in the presence of ROS and act as intracellular redox state indicator, whose depletion suggests the antibacterial effect of oxidative stress against bacteria. Kim's group [172] measured the levels of ROS in P. aeruginosa cells treated by GO and rGO, which were 3.8-and 2.7-fold higher than that in untreated cells, respectively. It was demonstrated that pretreated cells with the antioxidant GSH or NAC reduced the levels of ROS derived from GO or rGO, implying that cell death is mediated with ROS generation.

They found that graphene films deposit on Cu and Ge could inhibit the bacterial growth, whereas no obvious membrane damage was observed by graphene on SiO2. An electron transfer theory was proposed to explain the phenomena. A circuit for electron transfer was formed, where the electrons were easily transferred from bacterial membrane to graphene film and then to the conductor Cu or semiconductor Ge substrate, while the electrons could not be transferred to insulator SiO2 substrate. Consequently, the graphene-on-substrate junctions could serve as an electron pump for both Cu and Ge substrates, in which the electrons are quickly and potently extracted away from the bacterial membrane under the negative membrane potential, eventually leading to the destroy of membrane integrity and the loss of cell viability.",

Owing to its unique flexible 2D lateral nanostructure and the thinnest film, wrapping or trapping bacterial membranes has been regarded as the third mechanism of the antibacterial action. Rodrigues's group [179] found PVK-GO nanocomposite displayed excellent antibacterial behaviors through encapsulating the bacterial cells, resulting in reduced metabolic activity and inhibited bacterial growth. With slight difference, some researchers found that wrapping of bacteria could partly cause bacterial structural damage. Han's group [180] demonstrated that GO interwound or enveloped pathogens using an intact and relatively smooth cell wall or membrane. They further observed MMP changes and thus confirmed that GO could induce partly structural damages of pathogens via membrane depolarization, finally causing the bacterial death. Similarly, another study [181] found that 3D porous GO membrane could kill S. aureus through mechanical wrapping, disrupting and damaging cell membranes, and ultimate cell lysis. Akhavan et al. [182] proposed E. coli chemically reduced GO sheet could trap within the aggregated sheets, which biologically disconnected the bacteria from suspension and inactivated their proliferation.",

Besides the mechanisms described above, there are some other viewpoints have been established, including extraction of lipid bilayers, interference of protein-protein interactions, etc. Recent experiments and simulations [141] showed that graphene's sp 2 hybridized 2D carbon architecture has strong interaction with membrane lipids. As a consequence, graphene nanosheets could vigorously extract large amounts of phospholipids from the lipid bilayers, causing a deformation of the membrane and thus leading to the loss of membrane integrity. Luan et al. used large-scale all-atom MD simulations [183] to study the potential toxicity of graphene to cell functions. They found the insertion of graphene into the protein-protein interface could destabilize hydrophobic protein-protein interaction. The separated protein complexes destroyed cell's function and induced ultimate cell death, which agreed well with previous findings of the genotoxicity of CNTs to DNA [103] .",

Also importantly, these Cotton-GO fabrics could keep a high inactivation efficiency of more than 90% even after being washed 100 times, as well as cause no irritation to wounded skin. The flexible, foldable and reusable cotton-GO fabrics provided a good prospect for potential antibacterial applications. Karimi et al.

Dai's group [189] developed pegylated nGO (NGO-PEG) sheets with intrinsic photoluminescence (PL) by conjugating anti-CD20 antibody Rituxan. Chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto NGO-PEG-Rituxan via \u03c0-stacking interaction for in vitro selective killing of cancer cells. Himanshu et al. [190] studied the loading and releasing behavior of bactericidal aminoglycoside antibiotic, gentamicin sulfate from a methanol derived graphene (MDG) sheets. It was found that MDH possessed a high loading capacity of 2.57 mg/mg, and the release of the drug follows the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. Zhang et al. [191] prepared GO-benzyl penicillin (BP) anion intercalated Mg-Al layered double hydroxide (GO-BP-LDH) hybrid films. The incorporation of BP-LDH and GO could effectively extend the release time for drug delivery, whose kinetics followed the firstorder model. Nafisi et al. [192] presented a systematic study of the adsorption and release process of tetracycline (TC) on GO surface. GO showed a high loading capacity of TC via \u03c0-\u03c0 and cation-\u03c0 interactions, and the adsorption at equilibrium was observed within only 15 min following the pseudo-second-order model. Recently, Zhang et al. [193] prepared a cross-linking GO-polyethyleneimine hybrid film containing ciprofloxacin and investigated the release behavior of ciprofloxacin under different pH values. As a result, it showed slow drug release without an initial burst effect, which was consistent with near zero-order kinetics. Tian et al. [194] developed a GQD-based therapeutic agent with DOX loading and Cy dye conjugation via a cathepsin D-responsive peptide (DOX@GQD-P-Cy) for drug delivery, release and response both in vitro and in vivo. After treatment by DOX@GQD-P-Cy, tumor size was reduced to about 1/3 that that of free DOX. In addition, the agents were used as fluorescent probes for tacking of cell apoptosis induction and real-time evaluation (Fig. 8(b) ). Gu et al. developed a cellular protease-mediated graphene-based co-delivery nanosystem incorporating a cell-membrane-targeted anticancer protein and a chemotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment [195] . In further studies, they reported a ATP-responsive anticancer drug delivery system using DNA-graphene nanohybrid aggregates for controlled released of DOX [196] .",

For real lake and creek water, the Ag/rGO hydrogel could efficiently inactivate more than 94% E. coli cells as well as around 99% of coliforms (Fig. 8(c) ), which implies its usage for point-of-use water disinfection application. Recently, the same group co-decorated highly dispersed TiO2 and carbon dots (C-dots) [198] or WO3 nanorods [199] on rGO, and the two ternary nanocomposites showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for inactivation of E. coli via electron transfer mechanism. Ray's group [200] developed a PGLa antimicrobial peptide and glutathione conjugated CNT bridged 3D porous GO membrane, which could capture and inactive E. coli bacteria via synergistic mechanism. Moreover, such membrane has the capability to simultaneously remove E. coli, As(III), As(V), and Pb(II) from river water sample. Srikanth et al.

One of the major challenges is understanding the mechanism about the antibacterial activity of graphene and its derivatives. Several studies claimed that GO had little antimicrobial properties; however, most findings gave a controversial view in supporting antibacterial behavior of graphene and its derivatives. In addition, the mechanism and influencing factor of the antibacterial activities of graphene-based nanomaterials have not been fully understood so far. It is still under debate that whether the lateral size, or basal planes, or oxygen content of graphene-based nanomaterials supports its antibacterial activity. Although many findings claimed that graphene-based nanomaterials produced oxidative damage in the antimicrobial activities, unfortunately, it is still questionable whether graphene-based nanomaterials act as direct oxidants or charge transfer mediators, or generate ROS-mediated oxidative stress. Thus, it is worthy of a further investigation to obtain a thorough understanding of the related mechanisms and influencing factors of its antimicrobial activities.",

Although a great many studies of graphene toxicity have been reported, it is still unclear whether graphene-based nanomaterials affect normal mammalian cells when they kill microorganisms. Due to lack of certain inconsistencies in detailed results and hypotheses of the mechanisms, establishing universal acceptance criteria for toxicity tests is necessary but has not yet been set up. Additionally, a better understanding of the mechanism of graphene toxicology needs further elaboration in future, which might circumvent the problems and find appropriate ways to realize the biocompatibility of graphene.",
