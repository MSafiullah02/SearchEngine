It has been acknowledged from the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the infodemic of misinformation is an important secondary crisis produced by the pandemic. Infodemics can amplify the real negative consequences of the pandemic in different dimensions: social, economic and even sanitary. For instance, infodemics can lead to hatred between population groups that fragment the society influencing its response or result in negative habits that help the pandemic propagate. On the contrary, reliable and trustful information along with messages of hope and solidarity can be used to control the pandemic, build safety nets and help promote resilience and antifragility. We propose a framework to characterize leaders in Twitter based on the analysis of the social graph derived from the activity in this social network. Centrality metrics are used to identify relevant nodes that are further characterized in terms of users' parameters managed by Twitter. We then assess the resulting topology of clusters of leaders. Although this tool may be used for surveillance of individuals, we propose it as the basis for a constructive application to empower users with a positive influence in the collective behaviour of the network and the propagation of information.",

For each of these events the corresponding nodes were added to an undirected graph as well as a corresponding edge initializing the edge property \"flow\". If the edge was already created, the property \"flow\" was incremented. This procedure was repeated for each tweet registered. The network was completed by adding the property \"inverse flow\", that is 1/flow, to each edge. The resulting network featured 107544 nodes and 116855 edges. To compute centrality metrics the network described above was filtered. First, users with a node degree (number of edges connected to the note) less than a given threshold (experimentally set to 3) were removed from the network as well as the edges connected to those nodes. The reason of this filtering was to reduce computation cost as algorithms for centrality metrics have a high computation cost and also removed poorly connected nodes as the network built comes from sparse data (retweets, mentions and quotes). However, it is desirable to minimize the amount of filtering performed to study large scale properties within the network. The resulting network featured 15845 nodes and 26837 edges.",

Figure 3 summarizes the values of each leader for each descriptor showing that even within the top ranked leaders there is a very large variability. This means that some nodes are singular events within the network that require further analysis to be interpreted, as they could be leaders in society or just a product of the network dynamics.

This is consistent with the definition of eigenvalue centrality that highlights how a node is connected to nodes that are also highly connected. This structure has implications in the reinforcement of specific messages and information within high connected clusters which can act as promoters of solutions or may become lobbies of information. The current flow betweenness shows an unconnected graph which is very interesting as decentralized nodes play a key role in transporting information through the network (see Fig. 6 ). The current flow closeness shows also an unconnected graph which means that the social network is rather homogeneously distributed overall with parallel communities of information that do not necessarily interact with each other (see Fig. 7 ). By increasing the size of the graph more clusters can be observed, specially in the eigenvalue-ranked network (Fig. 8) . Some clusters also appear for the current flow betweenness and current flow closeness (see Fig.9 and 10). These clusters may have a key role in establishing bridges between different communities of practice, knowledge or region-determined groups. As the edges of the network are characterized in terms of flows between users, these bridges can be understood in terms of volume of information between communities. ",
