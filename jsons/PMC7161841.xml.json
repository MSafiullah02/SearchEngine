To overcome decreased immunogenicity, subunit vaccines require the addition of immunostimulatory agents, i.e., adjuvants,9 or optimization of delivery systems that specifically target immune cells and tailor immune responses.10 Another key strategy for subunit vaccine design is to create a multivalent platform enabling the expression of multiple antigens in a repetitive array.11 Having a delivery system with several copies of T and B\u2010cell antigens from different strains of the pathogen could generate cross\u2010protective immunity and increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine. If required, these platforms could be adapted to display both antigens and immunopotentiators, such as Toll\u2010like receptor agonists,12 thus enhancing the activity, uptake, and presentation of antigens to the immune system. Adopting strategies that direct antigen delivery and release may stimulate more potent immune responses using lower doses of weak immunogens. Reducing the need for the prime and boost strategies often required in conventional vaccination regimens would lead to dose\u2010sparing, beneficial for reducing development cost and improving immunization efficiency schedules in the event of vaccine shortages.13\n",

Protein engineering and design approaches, in particular, provide increased synthetic access and control of components,17 with one example being the self\u2010assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) platform.18 SAPNs comprise trimeric and pentameric \u03b1\u2010helical coiled\u2010coil motifs linked in a single peptide. These polypeptides assemble into particles \u224820 nm in diameter. They have been optimized to act as vaccine carriers, and their biodistribution in vivo has been monitored.19 They can serve as repetitive antigen displays capable of inducing a variety of immune responses, and include particles modified with epitopes derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,20 malaria,21 HIV,22 and influenza virus.[[qv: 12b]] Other peptide\u2010based self\u2010assembling systems with potential as functionalized structures take on the form of nanofibers, or tubes, rather than resembling viral capsid architecture.23 These assemblies exploit the thermal stability24 and environmental responsiveness25 of synthetic peptide systems, along with dose control26 and the incorporation of whole\u2010protein antigens.27 Such examples demonstrate the potential of synthetic peptide and protein\u2010based vaccine delivery platforms.",

SAGEs are made from de novo \u03b1\u2010helical coiled\u2010coil peptides. Specifically, a set of homotrimeric (CC\u2010Tri3) and heterodimeric (CC\u2010Di\u2010A and CC\u2010Di\u2010B) peptides is linked via a disulfide bond to form two complementary hubs.28 Mixing of these hubs in aqueous solution leads to co\u2010assembly into hexagonal lattices,29 ultimately folding into spherical particles \u2248100 nm in diameter (Figure\n\n1\na). The working hypothesis of SAGE architecture is that each CC\u2010Tri3 unit is oriented within the peptide lattice such that its N terminus faces the exterior of the particle and its C terminus faces the interior, while CC\u2010Di\u2010A and CC\u2010Di\u2010B have greater freedom of rotation around the disulfide bond.28, 30 Subsequently, functionality can be incorporated via CC\u2010Tri3 to allow for bespoke dose delivery as the antigen dose is controlled via peptide synthesis and conjugation rather than passive encapsulation.31 The fully synthetic SAGE appears to withstand relatively robust functionalization,[[qv: 31a]] can be predictably modified to alter cellular uptake,[[qv: 31b]] and the modularity of the system allows for fine control of modification.29\n",

Their modularity means that by mixing different ratios of the hub building blocks we can incorporate multiple antigens, thus tailoring the immune response. Furthermore, the nature of the SAGE structure provides a multivalent platform that can potentially be used to deliver multiple antigens from different strains, thereby increasing antigen immunogenicity. Another important consideration is component stability. The hub building blocks can be lyophilized and stored as powder long\u2010term, which could also be a benefit to such a platform by avoiding problems associated with the cold chain. Here, we investigate this potential of the SAGE scaffold as a vaccine platform, and whether SAGEs functionalized with model antigenic peptides successfully deliver them to drive specific immune responses.

Cellular uptake was quantified by flow cytometry, isolating internalized fluorescence by quenching external fluorescence with trypan blue (Figure\n\n4\n). Both MDDCs and MDMs took up SAGEs with similar kinetics, with the greatest rate of uptake in the first 60 min. However, MDMs had a greater overall uptake of SAGEs compared to MDDCs. Although MDDCs and MDMs are both known to be phagocytic cells, the uptake of nanoparticles can be influenced by particle size and aggregation state and, additionally, the maturation state of the cells,37 which may explain the differences in SAGE uptake observed.",

PBMC proliferation is indicative of a T cell response and, in this case, considered to be a CD4+ T cell response against the TT peptide, a model CD4+ T cell epitope.38 Experimental controls of parent SAGE, free TT peptide, and parent SAGE mixed with free TT peptide elicited low levels of cellular proliferation. TT\u2010SAGE and SAGE\u2010TT have an equivalent amount of TT as both parent SAGE + TT and free TT peptide in the controls. The amount of SAGE peptide is equivalent for all constructs and controls, and so TT\u2010SAGE\u2010TT has double the amount of TT relative to its singly functionalized counterparts. Two of the constructs, TT\u2010SAGE\u2010TT and SAGE\u2010TT, induced a significantly greater proliferative response than free TT peptide.

Following the promising results observed with TT\u2010SAGE\u2010TT, two copies of the OVA epitope were conjugated to CC\u2010Tri3 to increase the delivered dose. BALB/c mice were primed on d0 and boosted on d21 with a 160 \u00b5g dose of OVA, either in the form of OVA\u2010functionalized SAGE or free OVA peptide. The free peptide was delivered both with and without Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), in addition to a further control group immunized with parent SAGE. Splenocyte proliferation was monitored as a measure of T cell proliferation,39 in this case that of CD4+ T cells in response to the OVA antigen. Splenocytes from mice given SAGE in any form were able to generate an anti\u2010SAGE proliferative response when restimulated with SAGE ex vivo (Figure 6c) and produced anti\u2010SAGE antibodies (Figure 6d). A low\u2010level anti\u2010SAGE antibody response was also observed in mice immunized with OVA + CFA, despite not receiving SAGE in any form. We believe this was due to the use of the adjuvant, resulting in an overall higher concentration of antibodies in the sera, and in turn a low level of nonspecific binding. In parallel, splenocytes were also restimulated ex vivo with OVA peptide (Figure 6e). Mice given free OVA peptide with CFA mounted the strongest anti\u2010OVA proliferative response, which is expected from the use of the adjuvant. However, the response against free OVA peptide without CFA was enhanced by immunizing with an equivalent dose in the form of OVA\u2010functionalized SAGE particles. Mice given OVA\u2010functionalized SAGE also produced OVA\u2010specific antibodies (Figure 6f). While the positive control of free OVA peptide with CFA generated the greatest antibody titers, OVA\u2010functionalized SAGE gave a significantly greater response than the free OVA peptide. This result demonstrates the potential of the SAGE system as a delivery platform capable of enhancing an immune response when compared to equivalent amounts of the free immunogenic peptide.",

Transgenic mice were used to test for this response to SAGEs functionalized with the extended HA.40 SAGEs were functionalized with a single copy of HA at just the C terminus of CC\u2010Tri3, as MHC class I processing is more specific than the MHC class II so far tested and positioning of the epitope has more of an effect on processing.35 To this end, we utilized transgenic clone 4 (CL4) CD8+ T cells, which express a high\u2010affinity T cell receptor (TcR) for the HA epitope. Accordingly, magnetic\u2010activated cell sorting\u2010purified na\u00efve CL4 CD8+ T cells were labeled with the proliferation marker CellTrace Violet (CTV). As the CTV\u2010labeled (CTV\u2010CL4) cells divide after priming, daughter cells will contain less of the label and so will become distinguishable from undivided, fully labeled unprimed CTV\u2010CL4 cells. Na\u00efve BALB/c mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with purified CTV\u2010CL4 cells. Mice were simultaneously immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) with either the HA peptide alone or SAGE\u2010HA at 200 \u00d7 10\u22129\nm or 2 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm (delivering 19 or 188 ng of HA per mouse, respectively) to establish an appropriate dose. The use of transgenic T cells allowed for greatly reduced doses compared to previous experiments, as these cells are primed to respond to this particular epitope. After 3 d, the CTV\u2010labeled CL4 cells (CTV\u2010CL4) were isolated from the spleens of these mice, and the extent of proliferation was determined by flow cytometric analyses of CTV expression. The data show that in mice immunized with HA peptide alone, CL4 T cells proliferated in response to both concentrations of the peptide. This is evidenced by a shift of CTV\u2010labeled cells to the left of the panel as a result of the loss of CTV (Figure\n\n7\na). However, in mice immunized with SAGE\u2010HA there was even greater CL4 T cell proliferation, at both concentrations, compared with mice immunized with HA peptide alone. This is evidenced by the appearance of a discrete population of highly divided cells (Figure 7a; left of the dashed line). Indeed, further analyses with either the HA peptide or with SAGE\u2010HA (both at 2 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm) showed that there was a significant increase in the percentage of these highly divided cells in mice immunized with SAGE\u2010HA compared with immunization of HA alone (Figure 7b).",

We are encouraged by the increased response relative to free HA peptide and believe that the added ability to enhance a CD8+ T cell response gives the system potential as a vaccine scaffold. With further optimization, we anticipate exploiting the modularity of the system to target multiple branches of the immune system to protect against a challenge.

            "text": "Positioning of the SAGE functionality and its effect on uptake and, importantly, downstream responses are areas that future work will investigate further. Based on the stricter processing of MHC class I antigens reflected in the work by de Haan et al.,35 the HA epitope was only incorporated C\u2010terminally in SAGEs. However, SAGES were functionalized with TT and OVA both N and C\u2010terminally to allow for comparison of the effects of antigen positioning on downstream immune responses. The in vitro experiments with TT\u2010functionalized SAGEs suggested that N\u2010terminal functionalization decreased the uptake of SAGE, leading to a diminished ability to stimulate CD4+ T cell proliferation. By contrast, SAGEs functionalized N\u2010terminally with OVA stimulated a stronger CD4+ T cell proliferative response, but weaker antibody response compared to SAGEs functionalized C\u2010terminally with OVA. While OVA\u2010functionalized SAGE uptake by APCs has not been explored in as much detail as with TT functionality, these results suggest that N\u2010terminal OVA does not affect uptake levels in the same way that N\u2010terminal TT does, as measured by downstream immune responses. We know from biophysical characterization that OVA functionality leads to the formation of larger particles and has a potentially destabilizing effect on component trimerization, and so it would be of interest to further probe the mechanism of internalization. Whether functionalization affects particle recognition and cellular uptake due to surface charge, differences in particle size, or aggregation remains to be identified.",

These components can be accessed synthetically or recombinantly, are not susceptible to problems associated with the cold chain, and can be modified to successfully display antigens. The modularity of SAGEs means there is future potential for optimization in terms of charge, shape, and size to drive the ideal antigen\u2010specific response. In addition, the display of antigenic components can take the form of peptides or proteins,[[qv: 31a]] whether linear, conformational, or conjugated, to best promote the uptake, delivery, and presentation of viral or bacterial antigens to the immune system. To date we have demonstrated that SAGE particles can act as successful scaffolds for the presentation of immunogenic peptide components, while maintaining their ability to self\u2010assemble. We now seek to explore whether SAGEs can be used as a novel delivery system to drive further antigen\u2010specific responses, and whether functionalizing with whole proteins helps to strengthen these responses. Finally, whether with continued peptide functionality or with whole proteins, the next important step will be to use SAGEs as a scaffold to effectively protect against an infection challenge.",
