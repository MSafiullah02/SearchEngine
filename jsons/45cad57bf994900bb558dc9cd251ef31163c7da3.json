Measures were adopted to ensure that certain agricultural products were only introduced into the EU according to common arrangements. A Regulation is being presently amended, laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination (in Bq/kg) of foods and feeds following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency. Such levels depend on the nature of radioelements present (Sr-90, I-131, Cs-134, Cs-137, Pu-239, Am-241\u2026) and on the food category (infant food, dairy produce, liquid foodstuffs, other foodstuffs except \"minor foodstuffs\") [47] . Because of the 30 year decay period of radioactive caesium, the EU trade in wild game, wild berries, wild mushrooms, and carnivorous lake fish of regions affected by the Chernobyl accident is still monitored and subjected to maximum permitted levels [48] . FAO, WHO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have also developed maximum levels of radioactivity permitted for the international trade of foods. In a radiation emergency situation, the availability of uncontaminated food and food raw materials to consumers and to the entire production chain is a serious challenge, especially during the growing season. Hypothetical contamination scenarios and exercises are recommended for preparedness. Short-term countermeasures differ from longer-term remediation. The most frequently cited countermeasures are: food and feed restrictions, clean feeding of animals (with feed additives to bind caesium in the GI tract of ruminants), shallow ploughing of the soil, addition of ammonium ferric hexacyano-ferrate (AFCF, reduces the transfer of caesium from the soil to rye grass and clover). In all cases, measurements of radioactivity, determination of the types of radionuclides, and general information and advice to all stakeholders are required [49] .",
