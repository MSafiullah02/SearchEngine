            "text": "The development of stimuli, dual- and multi-stimuli-responsive nanosystems, follows the same approach for improving the pharmacotherapy as stealth and chimeric liposomes (see 10.1007/978-981-10-0791-0_5) (combining two different or same biomaterials). These systems use intrinsic or extrinsic (external) stimuli as triggers in order to succeed in site-specific drug delivery and to improve the safety and efficacy of bioactive molecules. pH-, thermo-, redox-, enzyme-, magnetic field-, and light-responsive nanopreparations have been already studied extensively [13, 20]. Temperature-sensitive drug delivery systems offer great potential over their counterparts due to their versatility in design, tunability of phase transition temperatures, passive targeting ability, and in situ phase transitions [37]. Thermosensitive liposomes are developed in order to improve tumor accumulation, trigger liposomal drug bioavailability, enhance drug delivery specificity (i.e., drug painting dosing and chemodosing) and drug internalization, and personalize the treatment [77, 91]. Thermosensitive liposomal formulations minimize the toxicity of the encapsulated active substance/anticancer agent, control the release rate, and enhance the long-circulating properties by modulating the composition and the \u201csmartness\u201d \u201cdecision making\u201d of the nanocarriers [44]. ThermoDox\u00ae (Celsion) is a nanoengineered drug delivery system in clinical trials (phase III) and is a low-temperature-sensitive liposomal formulation incorporating doxorubicin (anthracycline) for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma and liver cancer. ThermoDox is the first heat-activated liposomal formulation, which consisted of three synthetic low phase transition temperature phospholipids and releases the anticancer agent at 39.5 \u00b0C [22]. In the past decades, there have been reported and developed many strategies for formulating pH-sensitive liposomes. The main categories based on the components and the mechanisms of triggering pH sensitivity are listed below. The first way is to combine polymorphic lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), diacetylenic phosphatidylethanolamine (DAPE), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) [74]. Secondly, the majority of these systems may contain \u201ccage\u201d lipid derivatives, such as N-citraconyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (C-DOPE) and N-Citraconyl-dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine (C-DOPS) [46]. The mechanism of action of pH-sensitive liposomes is presented in the literature [47, 74]. Since pH-sensitive liposomes cannot always sustain a slow and steady release, especially in a physiological pH solution, thus resulting in cytotoxicity for normal tissue, more sophisticated structures are being investigated, in order to overcome this possible instability of pH-sensitive liposomes. The investigation in the area of pH-sensitive liposomal vehicles for drug delivery is still an interest approach, and because of the new intracellular targets that are recognized, the efforts in this scientific field should be expanded [15].",

They possess macromolecules on their surface such as antibodies, carbohydrates, and hormones that act as detection centers from surface antigens that are on cell targets. During the 1980s, various techniques connecting monoclonal antibodies on liposomal surface have been developed. The preferable strategies by which the macromolecules attached on the outer surface of the liposomal membrane are adsorption to the outer surface of liposomal vehicles, insertion into the lipid bilayers, via biotin-avidin pair, and finally covalent binding [39]. The macromolecules that they are attached on the surface of liposomes have complementary ligands on the target cells, and consequently when they arrive close to the target cell, liposome binds specifically to the target site. Bioactive molecules encapsulated in liposomes that have monoclonal antibodies on their surface include anticancer agents like doxorubicin (anthracyclines), vinca alkaloids, and taxol (taxanes) that are released in the surrounding area of the target cell, reducing the adverse drug reactions and the toxicity and improving the therapeutic effect. The research on this medicines aims to the pharmacokinetic parameter improvement and the increased concentration of the bioactive molecule on target cells using immunoliposomes [33].",

The mitochondrion is an organelle composed of two membranes which create two separate compartments and is responsible for the energy metabolism. They are unique organelles as they contain their own genome mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). It is well known that possible drug targets are located inside the mitochondrial matrix and it is of particular interest to design and develop carriers that are able to move through the mitochondrial matrix to release drug to the target. Mitochondrial Medicine is a new field of biomedical research. Mitochondriotropic liposomal approach is considered as an effort for producing mitochondria-targeted particulate drug and DNA delivery systems. The use of reconstructed proteoliposomes containing mitochondrial membrane components was an effort to prove the hypothesis that liposomes by modifying their surface with a mitochondriotropic residue could be rendered as mitochondriotropic [19].",

This property seems to be due to two different areas: a polar interior cavity and a lipophilic bilayer. Hydrophilic groups in the outside liposomal surface develop macromolecular attachment places like antibodies, peptides, etc. These properties have led scientists in the use of liposomes in bioactive molecule-targeted delivery research and in the field of diagnostics. The basic liposomal application as analytical tools is related to the immobilization of the label molecule on the liposome surface and to the entrapment of the marker molecule inside the cavity. The marker allows liposome detection and quantitative determination and, therefore, detection and quantitative determination of the molecule under assay, using the appropriate analytical method (optical or electrochemical).",

For RNA detection, RNA is firstly converted to complementary DNA through real-time (RT) method and then follows PCR (RT-PCR) enrichment or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA). After multiplication, the enriched molecules (amplicons) are determined according to their size with electrophoresis in agarose gel (they have been previously died with ethidium bromide), and their possible functional identity is certified through hybridization with specialized probe molecules. Finally, the safest procedure is to find primary structure molecules with base sequencing. Nowadays, many specialized analytical assays for substance determination are available but require special equipment, analytical labs, and trained personnel. For this reason, there is a continuous effort to find simple, fast, and low-cost methods to selectively detect the quantity of substances of interest. This determination should be available without the use of expensive equipment and from nonspecialists. The speed has great interest, especially when controlling production in industrial scale. For example, if scientists are able to detect a great concentration of an infectious factor in food, they will be able to stop production and eliminate the damages. In this case, the use of biosensors, devices that convert the biological receptor interaction with the molecule (substance) that needs determination into an analytical signal (optical, electronical, etc.). Chemical sensors are composed of two basic elements: the chemical (molecular) recognition system and the physicochemical converter. The biochemical sensors are chemical sensors where the recognition system is based on a biochemical mechanism. During the past years, there is an intense research activity in the field of liposomes used to develop biosensors. The liposomal size and the number of bilayers can be adapted depending on the production method, so small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), or multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) can be created.",

For example, the addition of phosphatidylglycerol creates negatively charged liposomes, while the addition of cholesterol lowers the membrane permeability. Due to their great outside surface and their ability to connect to other molecule lipid bilayers, liposomes can be applied in analytical determinations. Liposome advantages include their great inner volume that allows a large amount of dye to be encapsulated (or another appropriate indicator), enhancing the received signal. The analytical determinations are distinguished as homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous are the determinations where all substances are mixed together in a container and all the reactions take place without any separation step.

Liposome dispersion system stability relates to its physical, chemical, and biological stability. Liposome size and size distribution measurements around the average value are important parameters to calculate the liposome dispersion physical stability. More in detail, we can mention the following: liposomes developed and dispersed in chosen water medium are in constant movement (Brown movement). The particle movement speed depends on their size, solution temperature, and viscosity. Liposome size distribution is a measure of their stability. When size distribution is stable in time, the liposome dispersion is characterized as stable and suitable for pharmaceutical use. The liposome nanosystem stability is time dependent since according to the second thermodynamic law, it is leading to collapse. In case where liposome size distribution increases with time, the liposome dispersion system is characterized as unstable and unsuitable for pharmaceutical use. With dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique (see 10.1007/978-981-10-0791-0_2), the Brown movement calculation is possible through data collected from the light scattering. Brown movement calculation will help to determine diffusion coefficient and, therefore, liposome size and size distribution around the average value.

This phenomenon is based upon the differences of the tumor and the healthy tissue blood vessel network. So tumor vessels have better permeability since they are developed in greater speed to support tumor\u2019s fast development. Apart from this fact, cancer cells are not that thickly placed next to each other, like healthy cells, and the tumor\u2019s lymph system that removes substances and nanoparticles (like liposomes) from tissues and organs is insufficiently developed. Therefore, nanoparticles like biological macromolecules or synthetic polymers with a molecular weight greater than 30\u201340 kDa and liposomes with a diameter up to 600 nm can penetrate tumor blood vessels and accumulate in cancer tissue and not in healthy tissues or organs. The phenomenon is called passive targeting. Liposomal technology has a lot to offer in disease therapy.

Polymersome macromolecular nature makes them especially resistant in detergent dissolution, and therefore, the surfactant integration is proposed to be on the polymersome membrane to avoid collapse. Ruysschaert and coworkers [71] observed that this hybrid structure helps implementing phospholipids inside polymersomes, a fact that offers them advantages related to their physicochemical properties and greater effectiveness as bioactive molecule transports. Possibly, the most important example of amphiphilic molecule stabilization is the use of polymersomes for cell membrane protein scaffold. The ability of hydrophilic molecule entrapment into polymersomes is an important advantage for their transport and delivery to damaged tissues. Despite all the above, the hydrophobic or amphiphilic molecule entrapment is more or less simple; the complex kinetics when forming polymersomes prevent hydrophilic molecule entrapment. The most important parameter regarding hydrophilic molecule entrapment is the polymer membrane permeability. One of the advantages that polymersomes have is that polymer solution properties are strictly checked according to side groups\u2019 chemistry. The same polymer chain has both soluble and insoluble parts and their equilibrium defines total solubility. Therefore, polymer solubility can change from outer stimulants like temperature, pH, ionic strength, light, etc. This polymersome response to the outside environment has been used in polymer mechanics, and many devices have been developed based on polymer solubility. In polymersomes, these properties can be used for structure development that will be dissolved under specific environmental conditions. The simplest approach has been made with hydrophilic polymer connection with hydrolyzed polymers. In contact with water, polymers will be degraded by nonreversible polymersome disassembly and content release. The degradation ability after a period of time or an external stimulant is of critical importance for new carriers and for the modified polymersome diameter development. Reversible disassembly can take place when combining hydrophilic polymers with polymers presenting pH, temperature, and radiation-dependent solubility. For example, polymersomes with structural units of poly(L-glutamic acid)-poly(L-lysine) that respond to pH can be modified reversibly into weak acidic or basic water solutions. Lastly, similar transition can take place by the use of sensitive to radiation groups like poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(methylphenylsilane) (PEO-PMPS) and azobenzene-containing poly(methacrylate)-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA-PAzoMA). Recently, Mabrouk and his coworkers [48] published structures of asymmetrical polymersomes whose membrane consisted only of one lamellar copolymer sensitive to radiation: poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(4butyloxy-2-(4-(methacryloyloxy)butyloxy)-4 (4-butyloxybenzoyloxy)azobenzene (PEG-b-PMAazo444). When exposed to radiation, these polymersomes burst. This fact is attributed to thermodynamic changes related to membrane curve.",

It has been recently proven that polymersome surface can be additionally modified with molecules characterized as islands and have different chemistry.

Also, the development of a liposomal nanosystem and dendrimer (PAMAM) has been tested for the entrapment of a large quantity of the anticancer agent methotrexate and doxorubicin. Two different ways of using dendrimers as bioactive molecule carriers have been described: the bioactive molecule entrapment inside the dendrimer (inside the cavities formed from the branches) through hydrophobic interactions and ionic links and the covalent bonding of the bioactive molecule on the dendrimer surface. The development of a multifunctional dendrimer consisted of PAMAM G5 generation connected with the anticancer agent methotrexate or paclitaxel, folic acid, and fluorescein as detection molecules for dendrimer course into the organism is a contribution to nanosystem development that has targeting, imaging, and therapeutic functions against cancer at the same time. It is well established that cancer cells due to their quick multiplication need large quantities of folic acid. They achieve that by increasing the folic acid receptors on their surface. So, by taking on folic acid that is connected to the dendrimer, anticancer cells receive at the same time the bioactive molecule. Lastly, the fluorescent molecule allows dendrimer tracking. The first in vitro experimental results in cancer cells that overexpress folic acid receptors are encouraging. Some of the bioactive molecules enclosed in or connected with dendrimers are indomethacin, methotrexate, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and ibuprofen.

In relation to other nanotechnological systems, liposomes and polymers have been used in order to take advantage of the EPR phenomenon (see 10.1007/978-981-10-0791-0_6). This in vivo anticancer action and the simultaneous toxicity reduction of the known chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin and cisplatin when incorporated in dendrimers were attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) phenomenon. Poly(glycerol-succinic acid) dendrimers have been used to dissolve 10-hydroxycamptothecin. The system effectiveness was increased in human breast cancer series, but the bioactive molecule quick release (6 h) excluded its systemic administration. Important entrapment percentages in various dendrimer structures have been achieved for anticancer molecule etoposide, paclitaxel, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. The hydrophobic anticancer molecule entrapment in middle size dendrimers (G4\u2013G6 generation) has been proven to increase their solubility and toxicity. The most basic disadvantage is the lack of kinetic controlled release since these systems release their content in a few hours after systemic administration. Possibly, dendrimer systems with incorporated anticancer agents can be used in the future for infusion directly to the tumor. The method of bioactive molecule covalent bonding on dendrimer surface offers advantages in comparison to their cavities. Different bioactive molecules can be connected to a dendrimer molecule and their release depends in the linkers\u2019 nature. With this method, methotrexate, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil have been covalently bonded with dendrimers of the polyamidoamine group (PAMAM). In all occasions, the results showed effectiveness sustenance, delayed release, selective accumulation on cancer cell, and lower toxicity.

The use of paramagnetic metal cations (enhancer parameters) improves the method sensitivity and accuracy. A very common enhancer parameter, the gadolinium salt diethylene triamine pentaacetatic acid (DTPA), is unfortunately diffused outside the blood vessels due to its low molecular mass. To overcome this problem, scientists studied dendrimers with gadolinium salts on their outer region. These studies showed that the modifications of dendrimer characteristics, like size and nuclear or regional composition, can lead to the development of enhancer factors that will be specialized for specific organ imaging or lymph node blood vessel imaging. Additionally, the use of dendrimers makes targeted delivery possible since the dendrimer molecular structure can be transferred to cancer tissues making dendrimers useful tools in cancer imaging. An example of dendrimer application in cancer treatment is in boron neuron capture therapy (BNCT), an experimental method of two steps. Initially, the patient is injected with a boron 10B radioactive isotope which selectively accumulates in cancer cells. Following, the patient receives radiation of a low-energy neutron neutral beam. Neutrons respond to boron inside the tumor and produce \u03b1-particles that destroy only tumor cells leaving intact the healthy cells. For this process to be effective, high concentration of 10B inside the cancer cells is needed. This can be achieved by the use of boron incorporated dendrimers and only if they can deliver it to cancer cells.",

Tumor contains cells with different genetic materials and biochemical, immune, and biological characteristics. Cells can vary according to surface cell receptors, enzymes, karyotype, morphology, recycle time, sensitivity in various therapeutic factors, and metastasis ability.

The basic procedure reported in biological systems and nanosystems is self-assembly that controls various processes kinetically and thermodynamically. The most important biomaterial used by biomedical engineering, the scientific environment of nanobiotechnology in the field of health that combines the biological properties with the nanomaterial properties, is the genetic material, the DNA. DNA is implicated in numerous biological functions through biochemical paths while, because it is a nanomaterial, we can approach its physical properties through the science of biophysics. Recently, literature suggested that the genetic material plays an important biophysical role in physical phenomena with possible future biological applications. More in particularly, Kunming Xu [90] suggested at his work entitled Stepwise Oscillatory Circuits of DNA Molecule published in the Journal of Biological Physics, 2009 that the DNA biomolecule functions as a stepwise oscillatory circuit of electromagnetic radiation. One DNA molecule is characterized as a stepwise oscillatory circuit of electromagnetic radiation, where each base pair is a capacitor, each phospho group acts like an electric self-induction, and each desoxyribose acts as an electric switch. The circuit calculates the DNA conductance through charge rebounds between smaller and greater distances according to the experimental results that lead to many stages of mechanical rebounds. Therefore, in a charge rebound that is opposite to the phenomenon, the circuit acts according to the charge transfer mechanisms that reflect the genetic material credibility in electron transfer. The stepwise oscillatory charge transfer through DNA sequence is the one controlling the oscillatory frequency. Another approach of biophysical background concerns the electromagnetic signals that are developed from water nanostructures derived from bacterial DNA nucleotide sequences. Montagnier and his partners published a study presenting a new DNA property that is based in some bacterial sequence property to produce electromagnetic waves in high concentration water solutions. This appears to be a coordination phenomenon due to the low-frequency electromagnetic field wave that is applied. Most pathogenic organisms\u2019 DNA contains sequences that produce these signals. This phenomenon gives rise to the development of high-sensitivity detection systems for chronic bacterial infections in human and animal diseases. Most pathogenic organisms\u2019 DNA contains sequences that are able to produce these signals. This phenomenon raises new possibilities for the development of high-sensitivity tracking systems in both human and animal chronic bacterial infections. From all the examples mentioned above, the contribution of biophysics in the study of materials that structure the living organisms and are involved in numerous biochemical paths that lead to biological processes is observed. Classic physics, through its principles and laws, offers tools that can be used in understanding the behavior of these materials, not as chemical macromolecules, but as material sections with such a behavior that is based on their physical abilities like electrical conductance and electromagnetic radiation emission. Modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, has set a framework for the DNA behavior interpretation, one single nanobiomaterial that codes the genetic information.",

The proteasome hydrophobic nature can contribute to vaccine transfer by facilitating the interactions between vaccine particles and their uptake from the ESN cells that will result in immune response. This technology is applied for vaccines against viruses, allergens, swines, and viruses of the respiratory syncytium.",
