To differentiate KD from systemic\u2010onset juvenile arthritis, Lefevre\u2010Utile et al. suggested that the latter had mild coronary changes including limited dilatation rather than true aneurysms. In addition, children with SoJIA do not respond to IVIG therapy but rather require high dose of steroids for fever defervescence. Children with SoJIA and coronary artery abnormalities required high dose steroids, were steroid dependant and had poor prognosis.7\n",
