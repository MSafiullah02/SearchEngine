            "text": "To the Editor -The UK food system is undoubtedly being stress-tested by COVID-19. Some commentators have suggested that the food system is somehow dysfunctional, non-resilient, or delocalized to a perilous extent 1 . Others have extrapolated further, conflating current product scarcities with supply chain risks from globalization 2 . However, these observations may well overlook the benefits of contemporary supply chains, and are usually vague about what alternatives might look like, or how the system might cope better with shocks.",

At the time of writing, there is no demonstrable supply-side shock, apart from accessibility constraints for vulnerable groups, food banks and school meals, which are the sphere of coordinated social care. Production, processing, transport and retailing are all key elements in integrated supply chains; policy is, correctly, for these to remain operational. Similarly, relative to the last global food price spike in 2008, international food commodity trade has not been significantly disrupted by restrictive trade policies 3 .",

A longer-term supply shock is not inevitable provided we avoid any escalation of global trade restrictions, which may provoke market speculation, and given non-catastrophic rates of illness. If anything, supermarkets have responded to a demand spike by in some cases taking up excess labour from other mothballed sectors 4 .",
