In the previous century, many technologic advances have contributed substantially to the health of individuals and communities. For example, childhood immunizations have reduced prevaccine morbidity from nine vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States by an average of 99% between 1900 and 1998, and they have virtually eliminated previously common diseases, such as diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and smallpox.1, 2 The incidence of many foodborne diseases, including typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and botulism, have dramatically declined primarily as a result of health-related innovations, such as pasteurization, sanitation, and home refrigeration.3 Diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies have been virtually eliminated in many developed countries through the use of food fortification. In addition, advances in vehicle and highway design, such as energy-absorbing steering wheels, safety belts, and highway barriers, helped reduce the U.S. death rate per vehicle miles traveled by more than threefold from 1966 to 1999.4, 5\n",

The entire Encyclopaedia Britannica can be transmitted over the Internet across the United States in less than 1 second, but it could take weeks to months before a reportable disease is communicated to public health officials (estimated transmission time based on size of the Encyclopaedia Britannica being about 1 gigabyte and transmission over a 10 gigabit/second Internet2 network, such as Abilene). At a time when prototype nanotechnologies can detect the presence of diagnostic proteins and genetic material in molecular-scale quantities, most countries continue to rely on an antiquated system of crude organoleptic inspections to ensure the safety of our food supply.8, 9 As SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and other recent disease outbreaks illustrate, current global disease surveillance systems and the public health infrastructure are grossly inadequate in monitoring and containing public health threats.10 In fact, technologies used by the U.S. trucking industry to monitor vehicles, optimize routing, and communicate with drivers are much more advanced than that used by public health professionals to track health problems, optimize services, and communicate.11, 12\n",

Such interventions can be environmental, educational, organizational, social, or technologic in nature. Population health technology (PHT) is defined as the application of an emerging technology to improve the health of populations. Clearly, this definition could overlap with other concepts, but, for the purposes of this paper, public health is considered a subset of population health, and PHT as a subset of eHealth technologies.14 Population health technology focuses on technologies that improve health on a population level rather than in an individually focused, medical care context. Thus, PHTs typically emphasize preventive, behavioral, environmental, social, and systems-oriented interventions rather than medically oriented ones. Although related terms, such as \u201cconsumer health informatics\u201d and \u201cpublic health informatics\u201d might encompass some aspects of PHT, these terms focus primarily on information technology (IT) and, in many cases, solely on software applications (Table 1).\n15, 16, 17 Population health technology is proposed as a broader concept that includes non\u2013IT-emerging technologies. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges posed by PHTs, and it describes a path to promote and accelerate their development and diffusion.",

            "text": "An example of how a specific PHT could improve population health follows. Several companies have developed networked sensors that can detect acoustic signatures of gunshots.18 Mounted on rooftops or other structures, not only can these sensors distinguish a gunshot from ambient noise (e.g., backfire from car), but they can also discern the make of the firearm. Networked together, they can triangulate the position of the firearm and the trajectory of the bullets. Within seconds, they can send emergency alerts to police and emergency services and to local residents. This type of technology could help prevent gun-related violence in distressed neighborhoods, and it also could provide essential data about the gunshot incidence that can be used by local residents to advocate for improved public safety programs and additional resources. In the near future, such networked sensor technology need not be limited to the monitoring of gunshots, fires, air pollution, or other events that might be obvious or abrupt in nature. For example, future sensor technologies could be able to detect subtle deterioration of neighborhood infrastructure, such as damage to streets, sidewalks, parks and trees, and neglected buildings. They could also be used to anonymously monitor the relationship between such degraded neighborhoods and physical activity levels of local residents or visitors. Such technologies would help fill a void in our ability to identify and remedy local health problems before entire communities deteriorate. Of course, as with some other PHTs, many concerns, including privacy and appropriate use, need to be carefully evaluated before deployment. Appropriate roles for public health professionals in the context of these emerging technologies include helping consumers elucidate their needs and priorities, translating those needs to technology developers, working with developers to pilot PHTs, evaluating the effectiveness of the technology, and engaging in policymaking processes about appropriate funding and uses of PHTs.",

Similarly, technologists and entrepreneurs typically do not have the necessary expertise in population health and research.

Product developers and policymakers will need to proactively balance public concerns about privacy protections with the information-sharing needs of some business models and public health programs.

Technology innovations typically diffuse from \u201cearly adopters\u201d and others before they are widely adopted in the population.36 The diffusion process could help refine the technology and sustainable business models.37 Looking back, the personal computer was largely irrelevant and unaffordable to the general U.S. population in the 1980s.
