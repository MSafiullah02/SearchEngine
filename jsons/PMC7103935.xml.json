Simulations and modeling can optimize control efforts such that limited resources are targeted to achieve the highest impact [1]. The aim of this paper is to review the epidemiology of the Ebola pandemic and discuss the optimal control model that governs the spread of the virus in human population and suggest the optimum control strategies to control and curb the spread in the future. The world witnessed an unprecedented Ebola outbreak in West Africa which in the end was reported in some parts of Europe and North America [2]. By December 13th 2015 there had been confirmed reported cases in excess of 28 600 in total with over 11 000 people losing their lives particularly in West Africa and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the world. Outside Africa; Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and United States of America [2] were also affected albeit with no case fatalities except for one in the USA (Table 1\n).",

It is thereafter spread from person to person through direct contact with infected persons [2], [4], [5]. The incubation period beyond which infected people become symptomatic has been estimated to range between 2 and 21 days [6]. The Ebola virus is a unique virus having a filamentous, enveloped non-segmented negative-sense RNA. It belongs to the genus Ebolavirus, within the family of Filoviridae. Its envelope glycoprotein facilitates the entry of the virus to living cells [7], [8]. Till date five strains of the virus are known: Zaire, Sudan, Tai Forest, Bundibugyo, and Reston with Zaire stain being the most virulent with up to 90% fatalities [9]. The Pasteur Institute (Lyon, France) has sequenced the viral strain currently under circulation in West Africa and reports a strong homology of 98% with Zaire ebolavirus (the most virulent). The origin of the Ebola virus has been somewhat unclear [10], [11]. However, in 2005, Leroy and co-workers reported in the Nature, evidence of asymptomatic infection by Ebola virus in three species of fruit bat [12]. This indicated that fruit bats belonging to the family Pteropodidae are the natural host of the Ebola virus. Ebola viral disease has no effective treatment or vaccines, currently only supportive care can be given to patients.",

Time dependent control has been employed in the study of dynamics of diseases. For example, Rachah and Torres, 2015 investigated the effect of vaccination on a proportion of susceptible population and observed that the rate of infection of Ebola reduced due to this intervention [19]. Chowell and Nishiura 2014 also applied time optimal control to study Ebola epidemic reduction [14]. Other studies on using time optimal control to provide appropriate interventions to minimize the spread of diseases have also been carried out successfully [20], [21], [22], [23]. This technique of studying control strategies present an enviable theoretical results that can assist in providing tools for designing epidemic control programmes.",

The model assumes that there is a difference between first-stage infections and late-stage infection called super infection. Their model further assumes individuals in the latent stage develop active Ebola infection at a given rate. It also assumes that a proportion of both first and late stage-infection (super infection) recover and others move to death compartment. We present three control mechanisms which comprise two \u201ccase finding\u201d and a \u201ccase holding\u201d in the model. The \u201ccase finding\u201d is usually made up of activities that lead to preventive measures including screening, public education and others. The \u201ccase holding\u201d also has to do with designed activities that ensure patients take their drugs within stipulated times so that they are cured. The first case finding is incorporated by adding a control term that characterizes the contact between susceptible and infectious individuals so that the rate of infection will be reduced. The second case finding is instituted in the model by adding a control term that identifies proportions of those individuals in the latent stage or exposed to the disease and cure them so that the rate of getting the disease will be reduced. The holding is incorporated in the model by adding a control term that may minimize the treatment failure rate of individuals with Ebola disease. We choose the reduction of infected individuals of Ebola to be our main objective having a lower cost of the controls.",

This \u201ccase holding\u201d strategy again is further supported by Rachah and Torres in their extension of previous work by comparing optimal effect of vaccination on SIR and susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered Ebola models [31]. The numerical results from their comparison studies indicated that vaccination programme is more effective in susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered Ebola model than SIR Ebola model. In this study, the \u201ccase finding\u201d activities include mass education and vigorous campaign which also reduced Ebola infections on \u201ccase finding\u201d scenario. The numerical results obtained based on \u201ccase holding\u201d strategy that is treatment is similar to the study of Jung et al.\n[23] on optimal treatment of tuberculosis. This therefore, shows that proper medication on right time bases will ensure that those affected with Ebola can be cured. The numerical result obtained in this study is new and is not contrary to any previous studies on Ebola models.",
