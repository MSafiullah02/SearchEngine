The abilities of NECs to take up antigen, express MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and stimulate antigen-specific activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells were investigated by using a human mucosal specimen (see the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).",

Then the ability of MNECs to present the antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to naive T cells was demonstrated. MNECs from sensitized mice displayed an enhanced MHC class II expression on coculture with OT-II T cells compared with naive cells (Fig 1\n, A). The total number of OT-II CD4+ T cells in the same cocultures was increased. A tendency toward an increase in CD4+ T-cell counts was also seen when sensitized T cells were used as reporter cells (Fig 1, B). Analysis of T-cell activation revealed a pronounced increase in the total number (see Fig E3, A, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) and fraction (Fig 1, C) of activated CD69+ OT-II cells, as well as sensitized T cells, when using sensitized MNECs as APCs. Notably, sensitized MNECs exhibited significantly increased activating capacity, even without added OVA, which was supposedly partially due to the remaining OVA in the MNECs from the sensitization process. In line with this, MNECs from sensitized mice augmented the absolute number (see Fig E3, B) and fraction (Fig 1, D) of CD44+ OT-II cells, as well as sensitized T cells, in a dose-dependent manner. A tendency toward an increased IFN-\u03b3 release was simultaneously seen when sensitized MNECs were used as APCs (Fig 1, E). Finally, sensitized MNECs were unable to affect the fraction of CD69+ T cells in cocultures with neutralizing anti\u2013MHC class II antibodies (Fig 1, F).",
