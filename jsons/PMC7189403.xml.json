The twentieth century started with the outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in 1918, infecting one-third of the world\u2019s population and accounting for 50 million lives worldwide. It is known as the most deadly pandemic in the history of mankind. The influenza virus struck again in 1957\u20131958 in the form of the H2N2 influenza A virus, triggering a pandemic that claimed 1.1 million lives worldwide. Pandemic outbreaks are not new and occur from time to time. The major problem is controlling and developing effective solutions for these outbreaks as well as monitoring the viruses and other microbes closely for their mutations and cross-genetic translation. Table 2.1 provides a summary of major pandemic outbreaks that have occurred in the history of mankind till date (as per available sources; WHO, CDC, seeker.com and mphonline.com) (Lamb 2013; Bai et al. 2020; Staff 2020).\n",

Additionally, several governments have developed online live digital tools to continuously monitor and update the current numbers of COVID-19 cases. The WHO live situation reports provide live status of emerging cases across the globe and pattern of disease spread. Besides this, some other independent agencies are also keeping close watch on COVID-19 development such as John Hopkins University, Centre for Disease Control, worldometer.info, NIH, etc. The Pandemicity project, a multilingual medical research database for nCoV-19 started by pandemicity.org, includes several tools for screening and calculating risk factors of COVID-19 online. Many scientific publication houses are providing open access to COVID-19-related research works, which enables researchers worldwide to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. The effective surveillance from local community level to regional level to national level to world level is the key to find effective solutions for containment of the virus. Worldwide surveillance also provides on-time alerts as to potential locations where the infection may be emerging. Additionally surveillance enables enhanced cooperation among affected countries for formulation of collective measures to fight pandemic like COVID19.",
