Bacterial contamination in PLT transfusions may cause about one fatality in every 60 000 transfusions, a 50-fold greater risk than for red-blood-cell (RBC) transfusions [2, 3] . Severe sepsis is estimated to occur in about 1 per 20 000 transfusions, and bacterial contamination, more pronounced after longer storage [4] , is at 1 of 3000 units [1] . Routine sterility testing seems to be an imperfect tool. Because of the small number of bacteria in a freshly donated unit, the sample tested for sterility may not actually contain any bacteria, and thus, produce a false-negative result [5] . In addition, bacterial culture results are often not available until a product has already been transfused, as shelf life is limited to 4-5 days depending on specific country's recommendations [6, 7] .",

Furthermore, and of huge practical consequence, the storage life of PLT products could be increased from 4 to 5 days to 7 or more days. This would, in turn, prevent many units from expiring and reduce the lack of PLT products. In theory, there are several methods for pathogen inactivation that can be used for individual fractionated components of whole blood-red blood cells, PLTs and plasma. In practice, however, governing body approval (FDA in the United States, PEI in Germany and EMEA in Europe) has only been given to plasma products and PLT concentrates (PC).",

The goal was to examine the efficacy of the photochemically treated product in terms of a corrected count increment (CCI), while also monitoring haemostasis and adverse events. This trial showed at 1 h and 24 h no statistically significant difference in CCI; although a tendency in favour of the controls was shown.

However, 1-h CCI and total number of transfused products varied significantly, favouring the control arm. Closer examination revealed that products treated with amotosalen-UVA had a lower concentration of platelets (<3AE0 \u00b7 10 11 ). Interestingly, the amotosalen-UVA-treated platelets were found to be associated with a lower number of transfusion reactions than controls [11] [12] [13] . Cerus, manufacturer of INTERCEPT, also performed a radiolabelled PLT study in healthy volunteers comparing its product to a gamma-irradiated control. Results from these studies showed a 15-20% decrease in photochemically treated platelets. A lower CCI, however, did not result in a difference in bleeding, when compared to control [14, 15] .",

Results revealed a significant decrease in 1-hour CCI of 34AE2% as well as 24-h CCI of 33AE5%.

After 7 days of storage, the PLT count decreased by 7-10% in both study arms, a finding confirmed by multiple research teams [17] [18] [19] [20] . The PLT dose in amotosalen-UVA-treated PLTs is lower in part because of repeated transfers into different containers and to CAD filtration. Compared to controls, there was an 11% loss of volume and platelets alike in treated units [21] .

Leukoreduction is also beneficial to patients prone to receive multiple transfusions or a transplant as there are lower rates of alloimmunization, decreased episodes of refractoriness to platelet tranfusions and fewer febrile reactions [35, 36] .

Mirasol PRT treatment inhibited activation in response to stimuli or allogeneic stimulator cells.

PI \u2044 PR technologies are pro-active, rather than the historical reactive strategies. Turning theory into practice is filled with challenges. Laboratory research has shown that platelets counts are lowered by the procedure, most likely because of a combination of apoptosis, platelet storage lesion, as well as loss consequent to processing. This, in turn, has translated into lower corrected count increments (CCI) and higher transfusion rates in some clinical studies. However, PI \u2044 PR holds promise of many practical advantages such as immediate protection from emerging pathogens before identification and defence against bacterial contamination, thus leading to an improved safeguard of the blood supply. In addition, there are advantages such as the elimination of gamma-irradiation of platelets, possibly prolonged storage of platelets for up to 7 days and decreased adverse transfusion reactions. Thus, implementation into routine use may confer manifold rewards but will first necessitate further study, both in the laboratory as well as the hospital.",
