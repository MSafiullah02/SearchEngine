            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was an emerging tick-borne hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality (12 to 50%), and had been reported in most parts of China, South Korea and Japan [1\u20135]. The major clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of SFTS were non-specific including fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, regional lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and elevated serum hepatic enzymes [1\u20133]. Severe patients would progress to multiple organ failure or death. The causative agent of SFTS was a novel bunyavirus SFTSV, in genus Phlebovirus [1, 6]. Heartland virus, Malsoor virus and Hunter Island Group virus were genetically closely related to SFTSV and were isolated from patients in the United States, bats in India and ticks in Australia, respectively [7\u20139]. SFTSV was detected in Haemaphysalis longicornis [1, 10] and was demonstrated to be transmitted by tick transovarially and transstadially [11]. Person to person transmission of SFTS through contact with infected patient\u2019s blood or mucus had been reported in several clusters of nosocomial transmission of SFTS in China [12, 13]. Animal hosts of SFTSV included domestic animals and wild mammals, such as goats, cattle, dogs, chickens, rodents and shrews [14\u201317].",

The L segment contained 6,368 nucleotides encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), while the M segment contained 3,378 nucleotides coding for the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc, which played important roles in receptor binding and entrance into the cells. The S segment with 1,744 nucleotides had an ambisense arrangement, which encoded the nucleocapsid protein (N) in a viral complementary sense orientation, and a non-structural protein (NSs) in a viral sense orientation that interacts with interferon signaling pathways and played an important role in evading innate immunity [18\u201320]. The termini of the three segments of SFTSV were untranslated regions (UTRs) as other bunyaviruses, which were short and highly conserved. Indeed, the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTRs of the three segments were extensively complementary, forming approximately a panhandle-like structure [21].",

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that SFTSV could be classified into two clades including six genotypes [25, 31]. Bayesian analysis based on the SFTSV single segment suggested that SFTSV likely originated 50\u2013225 years ago [23, 32]. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of SFTSV sequences in China suggested that the virus likely originated in Huaiyangshan [23]. Only in China, was spatial transmission analyzed [23], but transmission among these countries in East Asia was still unknown. In our study, analysis based on the SFTSV complete genome sequences was performed to determine the phylogeny, evolution, spatial transmission and reassortment of the virus.",

To determine the molecular evolutionary rate and estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for each of the data sets, Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.8.0 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) [27, 32]. The HKY + G nucleotide substitution model and a flexible non-parametric Bayesian skyride coalescent model were used. To allow for rate variation among lineages, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock was used in all cases. We performed the independent runs for 105 generations, sampling every 2,000 steps. In addition, to accurately estimate the substitution rate, we repeated the analysis. The nucleotide substitution rate (substitutions/site/year) and the TMRCA (year) values were obtained from Tracer v1.5 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogenetic tree was summarized by using TreeAnnotator (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/treeannotator) and exclusion of the first 10% of the trees as burn-in. The MCC tree with median node heights was visualized in FigTree software v1.4.0 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). To test the strength of temporal signal in the data, which is essential to the estimation of substitution rates, we repeated the BEAST analysis (using identical parameters) on a data set in which sampling times were randomized on the tips [37, 38]. The 95% highest posterior densities (HPDs) of these randomized sequences were then compared with those of the real data. If these sequences contain clear temporal structure, then the real and randomized data would have different mean estimated substitution rates, and different distributions. Here, the null distribution of mean substitution rates for each data set was generated 5 times per alignment.",

Bayesian analysis based on the complete concatenated genomes showed the same result, which further explained the close relationships among the viruses from the islands surrounding the East China Sea including the Zhoushan Archipelago of China and Jeju Island of South Korea, and the Japanese Archipelago. The case fatality rate of SFTS patients in Japan was apparently higher than that in South Korea and Zhejiang Province of China [2, 39]. It is not clear the high case fatality in Japan is because of high virulence of the Japanese SFTSV strains or because of small sample size of SFTS cases from Japan especially when retrospective study were used for diagnosis of SFTS, which might be focused on severe or dead SFTSV patients. Japanese SFTSV strains were classified into the Chinese clade from the mainland of China in the previous study [31], but we did not find this phenomenon because the strains had no complete genome sequences and were not analyzed in our study. Strain AHL belonged to lineage E in segment L, but it belonged to lineage B and D in segment M and S, respectively, suggesting that AHL was probably a reassortant.

The reassortment event requires that the viruses must have at least two segmented genomes. When two or more segmented viruses co-infected a single cell simultaneously, the genome segments might be packaged into progeny viruses randomly. Then, the progeny might inherit genomic segments from more than one parent, obtaining increased genetic variability because the offspring might contain novel combinations of genomic segments. This process was an important reason for virus survival and diversification, as illustrated by the antigenic shift commonly observed in influenza virus, another negative strand segmented RNA virus [26]. Natural reassortment has been reported for various members of the Phlebovirus genus, including Candiru virus and Rift Valley fever virus [34, 42, 43]. Reassortment could increase pathogenicity and enhance transmissibility among vectors and hosts [44]. Six SFTSV strains were identified as reassortants in our analysis, which were isolated from human samples, suggesting that reassortment events occurred frequently in SFTSV hosts.",

From a genetic perspective, substitution rates are critical parameters for understanding virus evolution, given that restrictions in genetic variation within a population of viruses can lead to low adaptability and pathogenicity [45]. Our analysis estimated that the evolutionary rate of three segments was different, with 4.16E-4 s/s/y (95%HPD = 8.99E-5 to 9.72E-4 s/s/y) in L segment, 6.76E-4 s/s/y (95%HPD = 3.92E-4 to 1.00E-3 s/s/y) in M segment and 1.09E-3 s/s/y (95%HPD = 5.43E-4 to 1.60E-3 s/s/y) in S segment, which was similar to that predicted for SFTSV in previous studies and other phleboviruses (E-4 s/s/y) [23, 32, 34]. The mean evolutionary rate of the concatenated sequences was estimated to be 6.73E-4 s/s/y (95%HPD = 2.35E-4 to 1.09E-3 s/s/y). Generally speaking, the M segment should have the highest evolutionary rate in bunyaviruses, as it encoded the two glycoproteins which play a role in interaction with receptors in the cell surface. However, higher substitution rates were observed in the S segment because of the variability seen at the nucleotide level, in the highly variable region of the NSs gene sequence for SFTSV.",

            "text": "Temporal and spatial dynamics of RNA viruses are often reflected by their phylogenetic structure [46]. The inference of divergence events presented facilitated a better understanding of historical divergence and offered further opportunities to study viral demographic history and dispersal events [27]. Maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree supported the TMRCA for all sampled SFTSV strains were found to be 42 (95% HPD = 20 to 87) years ago, and lineage E isolates were predicted to have diverged at the latest time. SFTSV existed earlier than its first description in central China and later in Japan and South Korea. The primary reason was that SFTSV was unknown, and lacked the corresponding detective methods and tools for the new virus. Secondly, changes in the working environment increased contact between the vectors and farmers. Lastly, virulence of the virus increased because of mutations and reassortment events. Our analysis indicated that central China was the geographic origin of the most recent common ancestor of SFTSV because of having the highest viral diversity in the area and viral strains distributing in four lineages sans lineage E. Furthermore, another aspect was the TMRCA from the MCC phylogenetic tree. In conclusion, these findings suggest that SFTSV originated in central China, which then spread to eastern China, northeastern China, and from Zhejiang Province in eastern China it spread to Japan and South Korea. Based on the genotype distribution of SFTSV and Bayesian analysis, Fu et al demonstrated that SFTSV strains in Zhoushan Islands were from central China and South Korea, and the virus in Japan were from South Korea [25]. In Fu\u2019s and our analysis, SFTSV strains in South Korea were classified into three lineages or genotypes. Within the three lineages, one included SFTSV strains only from Zhoushan Islands, South Korea, and Japan, while the other two included the virus from central and northeastern China, and South Korea. Thus, we inferred that SFTSV strains in the mainland of South Korea were transmitted from Liaoning, Shandong or Jiangsu province in China, while SFTSV strains in Jeju Island of South Korea were from Zhoushan Archipelago of Zhejiang Province of China. SFTSV in Japan were transmitted from Zhoushan Archipelago of Zhejiang Province of China or from Jeju Island of South Korea. However, while these predictions are suggestive of a potential origin for SFTSV, cautions must be exercised in their interpretation because limited SFTSV strains from limited areas were used in the analysis. In our study, only 8 strains from Japan and 6 from South Korea were used, which could affect the lineage classification of the phylogenetic analysis and the judgment of the virus origin and transmission routes. To obtain more accurate data of SFTSV lineage classification, origin and transmission routes, analysis should contain more complete genome sequences from South Korea and Japan. Although ticks were considered as a vector of SFTSV, ticks could not fly and with limited activity areas of the mammals, there must be a host to carry ticks from area to area efficiently. We inferred that the host should be migratory birds, but we had no evidence.",

Theoretically, this might reflect the high antigenicity, which could be under selective pressure to evade the host humoral immune response as well as to adapt to their respective cell-surface receptors for attachment and entry [47]. Although we found two sites in the SFTSV glycoprotein under positive selection, we did not know if a mutation in the two sites could affect the virulence of the virus. Thus further research should be performed based on reverse genetics to identify the relationship between mutation of the sites and the virulence. The NS protein had the highest dN/dS ratio. We found that there were up to 5.2% diversity among all the amino acids of sampled NS genes. The NS protein is thought to affect virulence, primarily through its antagonism of interferon, helping the virus to evade host antiviral responses [18, 19]. The higher dN/dS ratio in NS gene might be the result from a co-evolutionary battle between the virus and host immunity.",
