            "text": "A very efficient programmed ribosomal frameshift is used in decoding the Escherichia coli dnaX gene. Two dnaX encoded products, \u03b3 and \u03c4, are synthesized in a 1:1 molar ratio and both are subunits of DNA polymerase III. Decoding of the dnaX gene is unusual in that programmed frameshifting yields a product (\u03b3), that is shorter than the non-shift product (\u03c4; Flower and McHenry 1990, Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990, Blinkova and Walker 1990). Frameshifting occurs at a specific site two-thirds of the way through the coding region. The second codon in the new frame is a stop codon, and consequently the frameshift product, has only its carboxy-terminal amino acid decoded from the new frame (Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990). As commonly found in programmed frameshifting, the change in reading frame at a particular site is stimulated by recoding signals present in the mRNA (Gesteland & Atkins, 1996). For dnaX frameshifting, three crucial elements have been identified: a 5\u2032 Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD; Larsen et al., 1994), a very slippery (Weiss et al., 1989) double-shift site and a 3\u2032 structural element Flower and McHenry 1990, Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990, Blinkova and Walker 1990. Similar to retroviral frameshifting (Jacks et al., 1988), mRNA dissociates from both A and P site bound tRNAs at the shift site, slips \u201cforwards\u201d by one base, and re-pairs to permit a continuation of triplet reading, but now in the \u22121 frame. The SD sequence preceding the shift site is not involved in ribosomal initiation. 16 S rRNA in the translocating ribosomes transiently pairs with the SD sequence in the mRNA and stimulates \u22121 frameshifting 10 nucleotides downstream (Larsen et al., 1994). The 3\u2032 structure, which also stimulates the shift, was proposed to be either a stem-loop Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990, Flower and McHenry 1990, Blinkova and Walker 1990 or possibly a pseudoknot (Blinkova & Walker, 1990). Tsuchihashi & Kornberg (1990) replaced blocks of nucleotides in the 3\u2032 region and showed that the putative pseudoknot was not involved. Two different models for the top portion of the stem-loop have been proposed Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990, Flower and McHenry 1990, Blinkova and Walker 1990, and the experiments presented here address this issue.",

Despite the functional importance of these RNA structures in programmed frameshifting, detailed structural information is available only for a few structural elements. Mutational analysis was used to identify pseudoknots involved in frameshifting in avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; Brierley et al 1989, Brierley et al 1991) and in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV; Chamorro et al., 1992). In the latter case structural analyses as well as functional studies were performed on variant pseudoknots resulting in a model based on NMR analysis Chen et al 1995, Chen et al 1996, Shen and Tinoco 1995, Kang et al 1996. A pseudoknot was also shown to promote efficient \u22121 frameshifting in simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1) by mutagenesis and probing analysis (ten Dam et al., 1994). More recently, a general model was proposed for the conformation of pseudoknots involved in retroviral frameshifting (Du et al., 1996). However, some animal viruses, e.g. human astrovirus (Marczinke et al., 1994) and perhaps human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Parkin et al., 1992) appear to use a stem-loop rather than a pseudoknot, for the stimulation of frameshifting. The 3\u2032 structural elements involved in bacterial recoding are stem-loops with the exception of a pseudoknot in the insertion sequence IS3 (Sekine et al., 1994).",

Chemical modification with DMS and CMCT was done on RNA-1, the long transcript, since it was not possible to do primer extension on RNA-2 (see Materials and Methods). Nuclease S1cleaves single-stranded RNA with no known sequence specificity. RNase T1cleaves after unpaired guanosine residues and to a lesser extent, after guanosine residues involved in non-canonical base-pairing (Felden et al., 1997). The V1nuclease from cobra venom preferentially hydrolyzes double-stranded RNA and within regions containing stacked nucleotides. However, Lowman & Draper (1986) suggest that V1nuclease recognizes any 4 to 6 nucleotide segment of polynucleotide backbone with an approximately helical conformation, and does not require that the bases are paired. Detailed structural requirements for Pb(II)-induced hydrolysis are not known, although, site-specific cleavages in a tRNA molecule have been identified Werner et al 1976, Krzyzosiak et al 1988. A particular tertiary folding and an increased flexibility of the phosphate backbone have been suggested as specific structural features for Pb(II)-induced cleavage (Brown et al., 1983). The use of Pb(II) to probe the conformation of 16 S rRNA shows its predominant affinity for loops and inter-helical regions (Gornicki et al., 1989). Imidazole induces cleavages preferentially in single-stranded regions (Vlassov et al., 1995). Probing of Watson-Crick base-pairing positions with DMS (N-3 of C, N-1 of A) and CMCT (N-3 of U, N-1 of G) was done under both native (in the presence of magnesium) and semi-denaturing (in the presence of 1 mM EDTA) conditions.",

The stem would involve nucleotides G-6 to C-2 and C11 to C16 including a bulged A.

This structure does include some dnaX sequence (the SD sequence and spacer 1 are part of the structure), but the HindIII cloning site is part of the stem.

The stimulatory effect of this 3\u2032 structure was examined by deletion (SL del) and specific base changes (SLM 1-22). In Figure 6, the functional effects of in vivo mutations are summarized, using \u03b2-galactosidase as a reporter. Synthetic oligonucleotides, containing the frameshift cassette, were cloned into a lacZ-containing plasmid. The different constructs were designed on the basis of the two-dimensional (2D) structure predicted from the probing results. The FoldRNA program (the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, GCG Inc.) was used to analyze each mutant construct for alternate secondary structures. In all constructs, the \u22121 frame stop codon (UGA) was changed to UGU (cysteine) to permit synthesis of \u03b2-galactosidase. The change did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990, Larsen et al 1994. The efficiency of frameshifting of all the mutants has been normalized to the WT, defined as 100%. In the WT the proportion of ribosomes that shift frame at the dnaX shift site is 50% based on comparison to an in-frame control. As ribosome drop-off is expected to be the same in both the frameshift construct and the in-frame control, we expect the estimated frameshift level to be unbiased by this issue.",

Replacing the loop sequence by a tetraloop (Tuerk et al., 1988; UUCG, SLM 18) increased frameshifting to 129%. In general, strengthening the stem-loop gives increased frameshifting. The potential for pairing between the SD sequence and the three Cs in the loop was tested by substitution of the three C residuess (SLM 19 to 22). There was essentially no effect on frameshifting.

An identical set of mutants were made that lacked the SD sequence in the frameshift window. The data obtained from these mutants are plotted in Figure 7B. Given the uncertainty in the theoretical calculations, a surprisingly good linear correlation exists between predicted stabilities and frameshift levels for both sets of mutants. More stable stem-loop structures produce higher levels of frameshifting. Furthermore, the slopes of the two lines are nearly identical. This strongly suggests that the SD-like interaction, involving mRNA and 16 S rRNA, does not influence the way the stem-loop works to stimulate frameshifting. The two stimulators work independently. Furthermore, there is a threshold stability below which the stem-loop does not stimulate frameshifting (non-zero x intercept). As expected, this threshold is lower for the set of mutants in which the SD sequence is present (line shifted to the right in Figure 7B compared to 7A), since the SD interaction increases frameshifting (Larsen et al., 1994). The two independent stimulatory elements can act together.",

The distance between the slippery sequence and the 3\u2032 stimulator appears to be constrained to 5 to 8 nucleotides in viruses (with two possible exceptions, Brierley, 1995). That precise spacing is critical for high-level frameshifting has been demonstrated in avian coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV, Brierley et al., 1989), in the Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV, Morikawa & Bishop, 1992), in Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type II (HTLV-II, Kollmus et al., 1994), and in Simian Retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1, ten Dam et al., 1994). Alteration of the relative position of the shift site in IBV by three nucleotides with respect to the pseudoknot, causes a dramatic reduction in frameshifting efficiency. A similar result was observed in FIV. Deletion or insertion of a codon reduced frameshifting to between 2 and 5% compared to about 30% frameshifting in a wild-type construct. In HTLV-II and SRV-1, the optimal spacing was found to be seven nucleotides as is present in the wild-type sequences.",

Our probing data distinguish between the two, and strongly suggest that the model illustrated in Figure 1A is correct, except that the probing results argue against the formation of the A29\u00b7U58 base-pair. The data also rule out possible pairing between the SD sequence and nucleotides in the loop. The five nucleotides in the loop are all accessible to cleavage by imidazole and lead, and their Watson-Crick positions are all modified by DMS and CMCT. Theoretical calculations of \u0394G values (Turner et al., 1988) show that the stability of the stem-loop structure correlates with the frameshifting efficiency Figure 6, Figure 7. The more stable stem-loop structures cause increased frameshifting even above WT levels. The strength of the stem-loop is not the only factor influencing frameshifting. The SD sequence 10 bases 5\u2032 of the shift site is also a significant contributor to frameshifting, both in dnaX mRNA and mRNAs from other genes (Larsen et al., 1994). Our data strongly suggest that the two stimulators work independently. The SD-like mRNA:rRNA interaction does not influence the way the stem-loop works to stimulate frameshifting and vice versa. To a first approximation, the identity of any single nucleotide in the stem-loop is unimportant provided that the overall structure is maintained. A similar result was observed for the pseudoknot involved in IBV frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1991).",

Notably, this frameshift efficiency is achieved without a second stem and formation of a pseudoknot; in contrast efficient eukaryotic \u22121 frameshifting events utilize pseudoknots. The most efficient eukaryotic frameshifts known are in IBV and MMTV gag-pro where the efficiencies are 23 to 30% Brierley et al 1987, Moore et al 1987, Jacks et al 1987. In addition to MMTV, other retroviruses that require two shifts to make the Gag-Pro-Pol precursor have similar high efficiency for the gag-pro shift (Nam et al., 1993). A high efficiency shift (26 to 29%) has also been reported for a plant virus, cocksfoot mottle sobemovirus, but the nature of the stimulatory element(s) has not yet been experimentally investigated (Makinen et al., 1995). In distinction to eukaryotes, the only reported case of a pseudoknot stimulator in prokaryotic frameshifting is in decoding the insertion sequence IS3 (Sekine et al., 1994). Further work is needed to compare the relative contributions of stem-loops and pseudoknots in prokaryotic frameshifting.",

Presumably a small addition to the bottom half of the stem in the absence of the top half would give WT level frameshifting. It could be that the complex nature of the shift signals is an evolutionary relic which reflect an unknown origin. Perhaps they once served some other function and got trapped by the requirement for optimum efficiency. One could imagine that retention of the top part of the stem-loop may reflect selection at the amino acid level, but this is difficult to envisage for the SD sequence. It is not obvious that regulation is the reason for the complexity. The dnaX frameshifting ratio appears to be set; there is no evidence for autoregulation as in RF2 frameshifting Craigen and Caskey 1986, Kawakami and Nakamura 1990. Adding purified \u03c4 and \u03b3 subunits to an in vitro translation system had no effect on frameshifting (Tsuchihashi, 1991). However, there could be some reason for the complexity that is not yet apparent. Evolution experiments starting with engineered variants of the chromosomal gene may address this point. The chromosomal dnaX gene could be replaced by a derivative in which frameshifting is required for expression of the essential \u03c4 (Blinkova et al., 1993) but not for \u03b3. Having a simple weak frameshifting stimulator could create conditions for selection of potentially informative stronger frameshifting signals or perhaps even mutants in other DNA polymerase III components.",

A 2000 nucleotide long RNA (RNA-1) was prepared by in vitro T7 transcription of the wild-type (WT) plasmid previously used for in vivo\u03b2-galactosidase measurements (See Figure 2 in Larsen et al., 1994). This plasmid was linearized by EcoRV prior to transcription. A plasmid used for expressing a shorter RNA (RNA-2) was constructed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the WT plasmid was used as template. From its 5\u2032 end, one primer (62 nucleotides total) had a tail consisting of an AatII site, the T7 phage RNA polymerase promoter, and 28 nucleotides of the WT sequence. The other primer had a tail consisting of an EagI site, a PmeI site and 18 nucleotides of the WT sequence. The PCR product was purified on a centricon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and digested with AatII and EagI. The cut fragment was ligated into AatII-EagI cut pBR322 and the DNA sequence was confirmed by plasmid sequencing. Before transcription, the plasmid was linearized by Pme I. Both plasmids were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase following a protocol from Promega. After transcription, RNA-1 was washed with RNase free H2O on a microcon 10 spin-column (Amicon). RNA-2 was gel-purified (12%, w/v PAGE), electroeluted, and ethanol precipitated. RNA-2 was used for 5\u2032 end-labeling, and RNA-1 was used for the primer extension experiments, since it was not possible to do primer extension on RNA-2.",
