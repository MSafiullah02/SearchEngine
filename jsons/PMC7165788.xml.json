            "text": "The innate immune response against viral infection is important and mediated through different restriction factors. The first line of defense in viral infections is the interferon system, wherein interferon\u2010inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM) are involved (Takaoka & Yanai, 2006). In humans, there are four interferon genes located on chromosome 11 (IFITM 1, 2, 3 and 5), and several studies, including a functional genomic screen, have shown that IFITM 1, 2 and 3 mediate cellular resistance [demonstrated in vitro (Brass et al., 2009) and in vivo (Everitt et al., 2012)] in a wide variety of pathogenic viruses, including influenza, West Nile, dengue, HIV\u20101, filovirus and SARS coronavirus, indicating a differential antiviral role (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010). Interestingly, all IFITM proteins block viral replication and thereby mediate cellular resistance to viruses; nevertheless, it has been documented that IFITM3 protein shows greater restrictive capacity (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010). Recently, Savidis et al. (2016) showed the inhibitory capacity of IFITMs, particularly IFITM3, in Zika virus (ZIKV) replication (Savidis et al., 2016). Over the last decade, compared with other emergent outbreaks due to viruses, ZIKV has rapidly emerged as a public health emergency according to the World Health Organization (Savidis et al., 2016). In a murine model (Ifitm3\u2212/\u2212) of chikungunya virus infection, Ifitm3 exhibited an antiviral role, controlling the infection of multiple alphaviruses (Poddar, Hyde, Gorman, Farzan, & Diamond, 2016). Currently, the mechanism of cellular resistance to viruses mediated through IFITM family proteins is not fully understood. Thus far, diverse approaches have provided evidence that IFITM proteins inhibit viral fusion with the cellular membrane and do not function at steps of receptor binding or conformational changes in pH\u2010dependent virus proteins required for membrane fusion (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013). In 2013, Li et al. showed that IFITM proteins block hemifusion through changes in the topology of the cellular membrane and protect against virus infections at early stages (Feeley et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013).",

The severity of infections reflects a combination of host and viral genetic components. Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular aspects of IFITM proteins. The human IFITM3 gene has two exons, and multiple genetic variants have been identified in the coding region (Everitt et al., 2012). One of these variants, rs12252 (T/C substitution mutation), is an SNP that generates a splice acceptor site, resulting in an isoform (\u22062IFITM3) characterized by the absence of the first N\u2010terminal 21 amino acids (Everitt et al., 2012). The frequency of the \u201cC\u201d allele for SNP rs12252 is heterogeneous and varies between different human populations: the \u201cC\u201d allele is rare in European populations (C allele frequency = 0.041) and some American countries, and it is particularly rare in Colombia and Puerto Rico (C allele frequency = 0.074 and 0.111, respectively) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015).",

Notwithstanding, studies with larger patient sample sizes and various ethnicities are necessary because Asian and European populations have primarily been analysed, wherein the extremes of the frequencies are represented: on the one hand, the C/C genotype is rare in Europe (markedly in Northern Europe), while on the other hand, this genotype is common in Asiatic populations (Mills et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013). Currently, there are no reports concerning the frequency of the rs12252 polymorphism in mestizos born and raised in Mexico, and western regions of Mexico are similar in proportions between native Mexican components (pre\u2010Columbian diversity) and European ancestries, with a minor African component, according to Moreno\u2010Estrada et al. (2014). The main objective of this study was to identify the frequency of the rs12252 polymorphism in four mestizo populations of western Mexico and compare the results with those previously reported in all populations analysed in the \u201c1000 Genomes Project Consortium phase 3\u201d (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015).",

For descriptive studies, sample size was calculated using \u201cEpi Info\u2122 StatCalc\u201d software, considering a 3% true prevalence of genotype C/C in North American populations with Mexican ancestry established in the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (342 subjects were calculated as a sufficient sample, assuming a confidence level of 97%).

MscI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was used to digest the PCR product in the presence of the T allele (wild). Fragments with lengths of 624, 490 and/or 134 base pairs were observed. The genotypes were identified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29:1, 6%) and stained with silver nitrate. Additionally, two PCR products (homozygote CC and heterozygote CT) were sequenced using the same primers with the Sanger method (CEQ\u2122 8000 Genetic Analysis System, Beckman Coulter) to confirm the genotype (Figure 1). The samples were genotyped at CIBO, IMSS (Guadalajara, Mexico).",

(2015) reported an SNP rs12252 frequency in Mexicans from California in a small sample (n = 64), and this allele showed an equal frequency in the present study at 0.22 vs. 0.18 (p > .3). In Mexico, Moreno\u2010Estrada et al. (2014) used a fine\u2010scale ancestry patterns approach, revealing that a majority of Mexicans are admixed individuals with a large amount of Native and European ancestry and <5% of African ancestry (notably, these authors only analysed those three ancestries). Interestingly, Mexican\u2010Americans in Los Angeles (MXL) did not exhibit a homogeneous pattern, consistent with the diverse origins of these individuals within Mexico (Moreno\u2010Estrada et al., 2014). The frequency differences in rs12252 in western Mexicans compared with other populations sharing the same continent (Medellin, Colombia, Lima, Peru and Puerto Rico) were remarkable. Nevertheless, ancestry proportions of the three American admixed populations were analysed in the 1000 Genomes Project in 2012, wherein Mexico had a minor European ancestry, followed by Colombia and Puerto Rico with the highest proportion of European ancestry (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012). In addition, Mexico has the largest proportion of Native American components, followed by Colombia; Puerto Rico has the lowest Native American ancestry (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012), suggesting that although these populations share the same continent, there is a differential genetic structure between them. In addition, a comparison of population differentiation measured by Wright's fixation index (F\nst) of native and resident Mexican populations in US with populations sharing the same continent showed that Colombia has a minor genetic differentiation, followed by Peru and Puerto Rico with F\nst values = 0.0093, 0.0174 and 0.0189, respectively (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015). However, there is striking genetic stratification among indigenous populations within Mexico depending on the geographical area (Gorodezky et al., 2001; Moreno\u2010Estrada et al., 2014; Rubi\u2010Castellanos et al., 2009).",

In Mexican mestizo populations, the allelic frequency of the rs12252 polymorphism makes it a potentially useful and informative genetic biomarker for future association studies. The major prevalence of the \u201cC\u201d allele was identified in the Michoacan population. An understanding of the frequency distribution of marker rs12252 in Mexico in conjunction with other genetic and environmental factors is necessary for personalized medicine and could provide support to delineate therapeutic schemes in viral diseases currently identified as a public health emergency in Mexico.",
