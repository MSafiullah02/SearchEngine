HRQoL was measured with the Physical and Mental Component Scale of the Short-Form 12 Questionnaire (PCS-12, MCS-12). The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome-14. Physician-diagnosed anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder were recorded by patient self-report in the follow-up questionnaires. The associations of tracheostomy with HRQoL, psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work after 12 months were investigated by means of multivariable linear and logistic regression models.",

Prolonged endotracheal intubation results in acute laryngeal injuries in more than half of patients and is associated with significantly worse breathing and voicing up to 10 weeks after extubation [8] . Tracheostomy (TT), as the most commonly performed procedure in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, may not only increase patient comfort by reducing airway resistance and dead space but also avoids potential intubation injuries such as oropharyngeal and laryngeal lesions. The advantages of TT over conventional intubation are a shorter duration of sedation and thus promotion of early mobilisation and reduced work of breathing, which might facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation and hence oral food intake [9] . Nevertheless, the TT is an invasive treatment with potential life-threatening risks. Various complications (e.g. haemorrhage, infection, pneumothorax, tube obstruction, accidental decannulation) have been reported in up to 15% of ICU patients [10, 11] . A systematic review described that the most common causes of TT-related deaths were haemorrhage, loss of airway and false passage [12] . In the United States, TT results in death or permanent disability in nearly 500 patients each year [11] .",

Patient-reported outcomes such as HRQoL or patient-reported symptoms of psychiatric disease have not been investigated so far, nor has return-to-work. Also, a long-term follow-up perspective is missing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the association of TT with HRQoL, the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work of ARDS survivors up to 1 year after ICU discharge. Our hypotheses were that there are possible negative associations between TT and HRQoL, the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work of ARDS survivors.",

Information on HRQoL and return-to-work was assessed by means of self-report questionnaires at 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from the ICU. ARDS survivors completed the Short Form-12 self-report questionnaire (SF-12) as a measure of HRQoL and questionnaires on psychopathology. The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome-14 . Furthermore, patients were asked whether depression, PTSD, anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) had been diagnosed by a physician after ICU discharge. For the screening tools, the cut-off values for being at risk of depression were defined as PHQ-9 (\u2265 5) and for PTSD as PTSS-14 [\u2265 45]) [19, 20] . The published scoring algorithm of the SF-12 resulted in the Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) scores [21] . Scores range from 0 to 100 (higher values indicate better HRQoL), and a score of 50 represents the mean value for the general population (German norm values) [22, 23] . The measuring instruments of HRQoL are described in detail elsewhere [16] .",

Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD for continuous and as absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables. The Student's t test and the Chi squared test of independence were used for comparing tracheotomised and non-tracheotomised patients. We tested whether there was systematic variance between ICUs in relation to the primary outcome at the three follow-ups. These analyses yielded an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) close to zero based on the fully unconditional model and non-significant p values for the likelihood ratio tests. For this reason, fixed-effects linear and logistic regression models were applied. The predictive value of TT on HRQOL, psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work after 12 months were assessed by means of multiple linear and multivariable logistic regression models. The following patient-and treatmentrelated confounders were used: patient age, sex, SOFA Score, SAPS II, ARDS severity, body mass index (BMI) and length of ICU stay. The regression coefficient B for the linear regression models and the OR for the logistic regression model were calculated as effect estimates, both accompanied by the corresponding 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI). A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. All analyses were performed using the software R (Version 3.5.1, http://www.r-proje ct.org).",

Secondary findings were (1) TT was not significantly related to the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and (2) TT was not significantly associated with return-to-work of ARDS survivors after 12 months. Thus, the hypotheses underlying this study could not be confirmed. However, we did observe that TT was associated with a significant increase of ICU length of stay. ICU length of stay is a known independent factor ; the mean score of the general population is 50; one standard deviation is marked in grey associated with increased stationary healthcare use and 1-year mortality after ICU discharge and should be considered when deciding for the best time point of TT in critical ill patients [24, 25] . In our study, associations observed in univariate analyses were lost mainly due to the strong confounding effect of ICU length of stay.",

Only 10% of studies have included at least one patient-important outcome in addition to mortality after ICU discharge [26] . It should be noted that, in contrast to mortality, HRQoL is a complex construct that contains individual aspects with multiple dimensions, often operationalised as social, somatic and psychological variables [4] . The individual dimensions of HRQoL could be recorded by different measurement tools and must be correlated for a better comparison of patient-reported outcomes [27] . In an Italian study, 137 tracheotomised patients with respiratory and neurological diseases were analysed in relation to ICU mortality and HRQoL. Patients tracheotomised because of respiratory disease had a high ICU mortality rate of 50%; only 25 patients (20.5%) were still alive after 1 year. HRQoL of all tracheotomised patients was moderately compromised after 1 year, but the group of patients with respiratory diseases showed better HRQoL during follow-up [28] . In the present study, HRQoL was not impaired by TT. Symptoms of psychiatric disorders were often reported after survival of ARDS [6, 29] . As an example, up to 27% of critical illness survivors suffered from PTSD, and depression was reported in 40% of ARDS survivors [30, 31] . In the present study, TT did not influence the occurrence of psychiatric disorders. According to the results of the self-reported questionnaires shown in Tables 3  and 4 , 25.9% of ARDS survivors had symptoms of PTSD (cut-off scores for symptoms of PTSD: \u2265 45) and 55.6% symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 score \u2265 5) at the 1-year follow-up [19, 20] .",

The TT rate of 55% found in this Germany-wide study seems to be rather high and could be explained by the inclusion of a higher number of patients with severe ARDS. In the worldwide LUNG-SAFE study, only 13% of patients with ARDS had received TT during their length of ICU stay; yet, the rate in European countries was higher at 15.7% [15] . The ICU length of stay was also significantly longer for patients with TT (11 vs. 8 days). One possible explanation might be that the transfer of tracheostomised patients to a normal ward is difficult because of the elaborate airway management and more intensive care. Freeman and colleagues analysed over 44,000 patients with acute respiratory failure (10.8% of patients with TT) and found longer ICU treatment (24 vs. 7 days) in tracheotomised patients [35] . In our study, the BMI was significantly higher in the tracheotomised group. A recent study from the US which also investigated patient factors associated with 30-day survival after TT did not find any influence of BMI and socioeconomic factors [13] .",

Despite our best efforts to follow up each patient, the number of drop-outs was rather high, which may have resulted in attrition bias limiting this study. The instruments used for screening mental disorders do not allow making diagnoses such as major depression disorders and PTSD; only symptoms or the risk of being affected by such a disorder could be recorded. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest multicentre study investigating the association of TT with return-to-work and patient-reported HRQoL as well as symptoms of psychiatric disorders and returnto-work in ARDS survivors.",
