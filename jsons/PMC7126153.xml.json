SARS\u2010CoV causes a transmissible febrile respiratory disease for which an effective and safe vaccine is required [2]. SARS\u2010CoV is phylogenetically distinct from other characterized coronaviruses [3]. The genome is composed of a relatively conserved region encoding an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and a variable region containing open reading frames encoding sequences for viral structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [4, 5]. Like some other coronaviruses, the variable region of SARS\u2010CoV contains additional open reading frames that encode putative non\u2010structural proteins whose function is largely unknown [6].",

Another component essential in the assembly process is the small E protein. This protein is generally a minor virion constituent. It is largely embedded within the viral membrane and only its hydrophilic carboxy terminus protrudes inside the virion [8, 9].",

In coronaviruses infection, the S protein plays an important role in the immune responses against the virus as neutralizing antibody, passive antibody protection, and cellular immunity have all been related to this protein [11]. However, multi\u2010protein structures such as virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) composed of all major structural proteins that mimic the organizations and conformations of authentic native particles but lack the viral genome would be more likely to stimulate stronger cellular and humoral immune responses compared to a single protein vaccine containing only the S protein. Indeed, we have demonstrated for another animal disease, bluetongue disease of sheep, that while single or combined protein vaccines were protective in sheep against virulent BTV infection, BTV\u2010VLPs were much better vaccines [12, 13].",

EM analysis of the negatively stained infected cell sections exhibited no particulate structures when each protein was expressed alone.

In contrast, no structures could be detected in the cells that were co\u2010infected with recombinant viruses expressing M and S. The results demonstrate that the M and E proteins were sufficient for the assembly of particles but in the absence of the E protein, M and S could not assemble into VLPs.

Only two protein bands were visible, one of approximately 30 kDa in size, corresponding to the M protein and the other of 10 kDa in size identical to the E protein size. M protein runs slightly slower than the predicted size of 25 kDa in this analysis, probably due to the glycosylation of the protein on expression in the baculovirus system. The sucrose gradient purification revealed that the two SARS envelope proteins, M and E, could indeed self\u2010assemble into particles (Fig. 2A\n). Importantly, WB analysis confirmed that the two visible bands were M and E proteins, which reacted with the mouse anti\u2010SARS polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2B). To visualize the VLP morphology, the VLPs were examined by negative staining and EM. Smooth particles with approximate diameter of 100 nm were visualized, indicating that the VLPs were stable enough to tolerate the purification regime and the EM staining reagents (Fig. 2C). In the absence of S protein expression, there were no spike projections and this gave an even, smooth appearance to the spherical particles.",

The negatively stained VLPs exhibited a very different morphology to that of the M and E. VLPs with the S protein had a spherical morphology with distinctive fine spike projections (Fig. 5C). Clearly, the three SARS\u2010CoV proteins synthesized by a triple recombinant baculovirus in insect cells had interacted with each other and assembled into VLPs that were subsequently released from these cells. Thus, the VLPs not only closely resembled SARS\u2010CoV virus in size and particle morphology but also the virus morphogenesis. The yield of VLP from infected cells was approximately 200 \u03bcg VLP per 1 \u00d7 109 infected cells.",

By co\u2010expression of the M and E proteins we were able to produce well assembled, spikeless but stable VLPs. These smooth surfaced particles are probably an intermediate particle in virus assembly. The formation of VLPs by these two proteins has been reported for other coronaviruses [16, 17, 18, 19], and a very recent report has been published regarding the production of SARS\u2010VLPs by multiple co\u2010infection with single baculoviruses expressing M, E and S proteins individually. In this report, the VLPs did not bud from the insect infected cells but instead they were isolated from cell lysates [24]. However, when we co\u2010infected Sf9 cells with three recombinant viruses expressing M, E and S proteins, we were not able to generate stable VLPs with the spike protein on the surface that could be isolated from culture medium. For this reason and because of the inefficiency of the assembly process by co\u2010infection with several recombinant baculoviruses, we generated a single recombinant baculovirus that expressed all three SARS proteins simultaneously. This, in turn, means that every infected cell in a culture receives all of the structural proteins of the virus and expresses them all at the same time. This feature is particularly important for the efficient assembly of multi\u2010protein complexes where simultaneous infection with multiple baculoviruses is essential.",

The spike protein is the receptor binding protein, it has a crucial role during infection of cells and it is the main target for a protective humoral immune response [26]. In our study, the expression of the S protein was very high and the incorporation of S glycoprotein onto the surface of the VLPs makes these particles not only a powerful instrument for studies of the assembly and budding of SARS\u2010CoV particles but also as a candidate vaccine and a tool for SARS diagnosis. Self\u2010assembly of viral capsid proteins into VLPs for both RNA and DNA viruses has been reported and VLPs produced by this system usually retain the immunogenic and physiochemical properties of the native virions [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].",

Thus, we can hypothesize that as with other coronaviruses [18, 33, 34], the protein component of these particles essentially consists of a matrix of laterally interacting M proteins, which in some way require the E protein for budding and, if available, the S protein is incorporated by specific interactions with M. We showed that the VLPs that were formed consisted of only the M, E and S proteins but not the N protein, indicating that N protein was not able to be incorporated. However, it was not unexpected that the SARS\u2010CoV like particles were formed without the inclusion of nucleocapsid protein, as other coronaviruses also form VLPs in the absence of the N protein [16].",
