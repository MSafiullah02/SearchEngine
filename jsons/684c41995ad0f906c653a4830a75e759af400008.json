Successful activation of PRRs is, therefore, critical to controlling infections and driving pathogen-specific adaptive immunity, but overactivity of PRRs causes systemic inflammation, which is detrimental to the host. Here we review the PRR literature as it relates to horses and speculate on the role PRRs may play in sepsis and endotoxaemia.",

Sepsis is a systemic illness caused by microbial invasion, whereas endotoxaemia occurs when endotoxin, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, is present in the systemic circulation [2] . Sepsis presents more challenges than endotoxaemia because bacteria express many cell surface molecules or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including LPS, bacterial lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan and bacterial DNA, many of which may be present in the circulation at one time. Traditionally, Gram-negative bacteria have been associated with sepsis; however, in humans, Gram-positive bacteria may be equally important in disease pathogenesis [3] [4] [5] . In equine neonatal sepsis, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial isolates have been identified as causative agents [6] [7] [8] [9] , and Gram-positive bacteria are increasingly being isolated from neonatal and adult animals [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Activation of PRRs by PAMPs triggers the production of pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators, as well as initiating adaptive immune responses. Pattern recognition receptors include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), lectin receptors, Retinoic acid inducible gene I-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and may reside on the cell surface, in the endoplasmic reticulum, in endosomes, lysosomes, endolysosomes or the cytosol [12] . Successful activation of PRRs is critical in order for bacterial infections to be cleared successfully by the host, but overactivation of these receptors can lead to systemic inflammation and shock-like syndromes. Antagonism of PRRs therefore represents an exciting new therapeutic target for clinical syndromes such as sepsis and endotoxaemia [13] .",

The extracellular domain of all TLRs is constructed of 19-25 leucine-rich repeats that contain hydrophobic residues at distinctive intervals to form a horseshoe structure [14, 15] . The exact structure and alignment of the different components of the leucine-rich repeats determines how ligands bind. The shapes of the binding pockets vary between species, which results in differential responses to PAMPs [16] . There are at least 10 TLRs, but in this review we will focus on only the TLRs that recognise bacteria. Mycoplasma [159] Heat-labile soluble factor (GBS-F) Group B streptococcus [160] are isolated from a clinical case, it is highly likely that this PRR will be at least partly responsible for driving any inflammatory response. 53] . In mice, TLR5 mRNA expression is found in dendritic cells, but is not detected in neutrophils [49] . In the horse, both monocytes and neutrophils express TLR5 mRNA, but show differential expression of TLR5 proteins on the cell surface [52] . Toll-like receptor 5 agonists activate equine neutrophils, but not monocytes, alveolar macrophages or peritoneal macrophages despite the fact that these cell types contain TLR5 mRNA transcripts. Cytokine gene expression induced by flagellin in neutrophils was comparable with that stimulated by LPS or Pam3CSK4 (a synthetic TLR2 agonist) [52] . What role, if any, TLR5 may play in infectious diseases in the horse is unclear, but it may be important in shock, sepsis, acute respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal infection [54] .",

There are 2 distinct families of NLRs; the NLRP proteins contain a pyrin domain, and the NLRC proteins, such as NOD1, NOD2, NLRC3 and NLRC4 contain a caspase recruitment domain [70] . NLRP3, NLRP1 and NLRC4 form protein complexes called inflammasomes such that upon ligand binding a change in NLR confirmation leads to recruitment of an adaptor molecule (apoptosis-related speck-like protein [ASC]) and an effector molecule (pro-caspase-1) in an oligomeric complex. This complex activates a proteolytic cascade resulting in the maturation and release of, amongst others, proinflammatory cytokines of the interleukin-1 family [71] . The NLRs are emerging as very important therapeutic targets in many inflammatory diseases in humans. Both NOD1 and NOD2 recognise bacterial ligands [72, 73] . Whereas NOD1 is ubiquitously expressed, NOD2 is expressed only in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells [74] . A peptidoglycan derivative (L-Ala-D-Glu-meso-DAP [diaminopimelic acid]), present in almost all Gram-negative bacteria, is recognised by NOD1 [75, 76] . However, NOD2 detects M-dipeptide and GM-dipeptide, both of which are degradation products of peptidoglycans. GM-dipeptide is found in all bacteria, hence NOD2 can be regarded as a general sensor of peptidoglycan degradation products [72] . There are limited data on equine NOD1 and NOD2, but horses with Recurrent Airway Obstruction show upregulation of NOD2-induced nuclear factor-kB activation [77] .",

Toll-like receptor 2 antibodies protect mice from lethal septic shock syndrome [108] , and anti-TLR2 antibodies that prevent trafficking of the receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface were shown to inhibit in vitro and ex vivo ligand-driven cell activation [109] . Anti-TLR2 antibodies also show beneficial effects in arthritis and ischaemia-reperfusion injury models [110, 111] , but it is unlikely that commercial equine-specific TLR-blocking antibodies will be developed for horses. It is likely, however, that TLR2 antagonists may be useful for a range of equine conditions, for example, neonatal diarrhoea-associated sepsis, should these compounds become available for use in horses.",

However, PRR antagonists will need careful clinical evaluation because of the controversial results emerging from human clinical trials due to the complex, multifactorial pathogenesis of these diseases. Use of TLR4 antagonists in endotoxic horses is likely to be successful, but whether PRR antagonists will be useful in septic foals is less clear. Infections with mixed bacterial species will potentially involve multiple PRRs, suggesting that combination therapy simultaneously inhibiting several PRRs may be necessary. Complete inhibition of PRRs is potentially detrimental, particularly in sepsis, because TLR4 and TLR2 knockout mice show increased mortality in response to Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Specific equine drugs will need to be developed to achieve a safe treatment that blocks systemic inflammation whilst retaining the protective immune responses against bacterial infection.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the first fully characterised mammalian PRR, recognises the lipid A component of LPS and is the receptor activated during endotoxaemia [17]. Mice without TLR4 are more susceptible to Gram-negative bacterial infections [18]. The structure of LPS bound to TLR4 and its co-receptor myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD2) has been solved [19]. First LPS is extracted from plasma by lipopolysaccharide binding protein [20]; the lipid A is then transferred to CD14 [21], which then transfers it to TLR4 and MD2 [22]. Each bacterial species produces a structurally unique lipid A, which affects its efficacy at TLR4 [15]. Variant lipid A structures are recognised in a mammalian species-specific manner. Lipid As from Salmonella entericia serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) or Escherichia coli are agonists in all species; the E. coli partial structure lipid IVa is an antagonist in humans [23], a partial agonist in horses [24] and a full agonist in mice [25]. Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A is an antagonist in humans and mice [26], but is an agonist in horse cells [18]. The species specificity in TLR4 ligand recognition, particularly in the horse, is becoming increasingly well understood and is dependent on subtle structural differences in MD2 and TLR4 [24]. Also, TLR4 recognises a number of other ligands, including respiratory syncytial virus fusions proteins, mouse mammary tumour virus envelope proteins, Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin and the plant-derived cytostatic drug paclitaxel [27], although precisely how these PAMPs bind to the receptor is unclear. The importance of LPS in equine diseases such as acute abdominal disease [28,29], adynamic post operative ileus [30], laminitis [31], exertion [32], neonatal sepsis [33,34] and recurrent airway obstruction [35-38] has been the subject of extensive research efforts, particularly with respect to colic. This makes the TLR4-MD2 receptor complex an attractive therapeutic target for a number of equine diseases. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognises mycobacterial products, Gram-positive bacteria and their associated PAMPs, including lipopeptides, peptidogylcan, lipoteichoic acid and lipoarabinomannan [13]. Ligands bind to heterodimers of TLR2 with either TLR1 or TLR6 [16,39]. The TLR1/2 heterodimer recognises triacylated lipopeptides, whereas the TLR2/6 complex recognises diacylated lipopeptides [13]. Toll-like receptor 2 knockout mice are hypersusceptible to Gram-positive bacterial infections, including sepsis and meningitis [40], and people with mutations in the TLR2 gene have an increased susceptibility to infection with Gram-positive organisms [41]. TLR2 mRNA is present in the normal lung of horses and is increased after LPS challenge [38,42]. Currently, there is no evidence for TLR2 playing a role in equine sepsis, although if Gram-positive organisms",
