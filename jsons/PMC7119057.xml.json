            "text": "The host range expansion of coronaviruses (CoVs) from wildlife to humans via genetic recombination and/or mutations on the receptor-binding domain in the spike (S) gene is well established and results in several diseases with high fatality rates, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 1, 2. Despite their bat origins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have infected humans via an intermediate host, rather than through a direct infection from bats. Palm civets have been suggested, but not definitively confirmed, to be an intermediate host for SARS-CoV, and dromedary camels are confirmed to be the intermediate host for MERS-CoV [3]. Currently, the number of known intermediate hosts involved in the transmission of bat-origin coronaviruses to humans is limited. Compared to many other species, pigs are in frequent contact with both humans and other animals such as cats, dogs, horses, and aquatic birds, and theoretically possess a greater chance to promote cross-species viral transmission. For instance, pigs are susceptible to infection with human and avian influenza A viruses (IAVs), such as H1N1 and H3N2, which then reassort to infect humans [4]. Thus, pigs are regarded as mixing vessels for IAVs. However, pigs were not known to be susceptible to bat-origin coronaviruses until recently, when two independent groups reported the detection of novel swine enteric alphacoronaviruses (SeACoVs) distinct from known swine coronaviruses (with one group successfully isolating live virus). The SeACoVs were found to be phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus HKU2 5, 6. This suggests that bat-origin coronaviruses may have \u2018jumped\u2019 the species barrier to infect pigs.",

            "text": "In February 2017, outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea of suckling piglets were reported in commercial pig farms in Guangdong Province, China. The disease had high case fatality rates (CFRs, over 35% for <10-day-old suckling piglets), and none of the animals were positive for known pathogens responsible for porcine diarrhea [6]. Instead, two genomes of novel SeACoV were detected in the ill piglets by two independent groups, and preliminary analysis showed that the SeACoVs possibly originated from bat HKU coronaviruses 5, 6. It is currently unclear whether SeACoVs had been circulating undetected in pigs, if the viruses had originated from cross-species transmission, or if the SeACoVs were the result of viral recombination. To understand the molecular origin and evolution of SeACoVs, we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis at the genomic level by using all known alphacoronaviruses and bat-origin coronaviruses which are known to cause severe diseases, such as SARS and MERS. A total of 224, 312, and 778 complete genomes from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and alphacoronaviruses, respectively, were used. Phylogeny was reconstructed using conserved regions in genomes by the maximum likelihood method with 300 replicates (Figure 1\nA). Consistent with previous studies, phylogenetic analysis shows that SeACoVs were closely related to the Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 isolated in southern China (Figure 1A). SeACoV was found to share a common ancestor with human coronavirus 229E/NL63, but these viruses are distant from other known swine alphacoronaviruses, indicating their different origins. Further analysis on the S gene, which determines virus attachment, host cell entry, and \u2018host jump\u2019 of coronaviruses [7], showed that domain 0 in the S1 subunit has structural similarity to that of NL63. The rest of the domain on the S1 subunit was similar to that of murine hepatitis coronavirus (betaCov) [6]. There were 11 residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD, also called C-terminal domain, CTD) of SeACoV directly in contact with its receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) that were mutated or deleted [7] (Figure 1B). Seven mutations (a deletion of four amino acids, and three substitutions) among the 11 sites in SeACoV were also found in 229E/NL63, indicating similarities in the receptor-binding mechanism between SeACoV and 229E/NL63. Therefore, SeACoV may be able to infect humans and should be closely monitored. Infection of SeACoV in Vero cells (a primate cell line) will provide experimental evidence to support this possibility [6].",

Given that pigs are in frequent contact with human and multiple wildlife species, and that pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats in non-Muslim countries, it is important to assess whether pigs could be mixing vessels for the emergence of novel coronaviruses with high agricultural impact and risks to public health. It has already been reported that pigs are susceptible to infection with human SARS-CoV [10] and MERS-CoV [11]. Additionally, the CD26 receptor sequence alignment of pigs and humans shows 94.5% similarity, which is sufficient for potential cross-species transmission [7]. In southern China, the unique climate, the high density of domestic as well as wild pigs, and extensive bat distribution, together with bats carrying large numbers of recombinant novel coronaviruses [12], could lead to the emergence of more novel coronaviruses in the future.",
