Presently, influenza virus A H3N2 and respiratory syncytial virus are the most commonly identified viral pathogens in older adults with viral pneumonia. As diagnostic tests such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction become more widely used, the relative importance of additional viruses (such as parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus) will likely increase. Influenza virus should be considered as a cause of pneumonia during the winter months, especially during periods of peak activity. Patients with high-grade fever, myalgias, and cough should arouse the highest suspicion. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia should also be suspected during the winter in patients with coryza, wheezing, low-grade fever, and patchy infiltrates, especially if negative for influenza on rapid testing. Because clinical features and periods of activity for many viruses overlap, laboratory confirmation of influenza is recommended for cases involving seriously ill or institutionalized patients.",

The 2 envelope glycoproteins are important targets of neutralizing antibody [5] . Hemagglutinin (H) initiates infectivity by binding to cellular sialic acid residues and neuraminidase (N) protein cleaves newly synthesized virus from sialic acid on cell surfaces allowing spread of virus to adjacent cells. At least 16 antigenically distinct hemagglutinin (H1-H16) and 9 neuraminidase (N1-N9) molecules of influenza A have been identified. H1-H3 viruses cause most cases of human disease, whereas the others generally are pathogens of aquatic birds and other mammals. Antigenic variation in H and N contributes to the epidemic nature of influenza by 2 mechanisms. Antigenic \"drift\" is due to minor changes in neutralizing epitopes of H and results in epidemics and necessitates annual adjustment of vaccine formulations. Antigenic \"shift\" occurs when 2 influenza A viruses exchange H or N genes during infection of the same host. Shifts with resultant influenza pandemics occurred in 1918 (H1N1 virus), 1957 (H2N2 virus), and 1968 (H3N2 virus).",

[9] described 4 syndromes: (1) no radiographic pneumonia, (2) viral infection followed by bac-terial pneumonia, (3) rapidly progressive diffuse viral pneumonia, and (4) concomitant viral-bacterial pneumonia. Today, pure viral pneumonia is uncommon, perhaps because prior infection and vaccination has induced immunity among older persons, as well as the rarity of rheumatic heart disease. We found that 2%-6% of highly vaccinated elderly persons (i.e., 190%) in the community developed influenza each season, of whom 5% had pneumonia. Only 30% of hospitalized patients with influenza have radiographic infiltrates, whereas a equal percentage have findings consistent with congestive heart failure or other diseases [10] . The true incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia during influenza is unknown, largely because there are difficulties involved in accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection. In our recent study [10] , bacterial infection was identified in 10% of hospitalized patients with influenza, with only 1 episode of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Dual viralbacterial infections were more severe than were viral infections alone, as evidence by higher rates of intensive care use and morbidity.",

First isolated in 1956 from a chimpanzee with a cold, it was subsequently shown to be the leading cause of lower respiratory infections in young children. RSV is an RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, and it causes characteristic syncytia formation in cell culture. Two major antigenic groups of RSV (A and B) cause annual winter epidemics of respiratory disease in temperate climates [11] . Unlike influenza virus, RSV does not undergo major periodic antigenic changes, and yet, immunity is incomplete. Reinfection in young adults usually produces mild illness; however, the likelihood of severe disease and pneumonia increases with advancing age. RSV pneumonia was first described in older adults in the 1960s. However, it was not appreciated as a significant pathogen until outbreaks of infection in nursing homes were reported in the 1980s [12] . Rates of pneumonia and death ranged from 5% to 55% and 0% to 53%, respectively. In composite, these studies indicate that \u223c10% of nursing home residents develop RSV infection annually, of whom 10% develop pneumonia.",

IgM assays have generally not been useful. Serologic testing provides retrospective diagnosis when a \u04434-fold increase in a specific antibody is detected by complement fixation or EIA. Because rhinovirus has 1100 serotypes, serologic testing is impractical for diagnosis, whereas serologic tests for detection of hMPV and coronavirus are only available in research settings. Because of overlapping clinical syndromes, diagnosis of viral pneumonia requires laboratory confirmation. This is particularly important for influenza, because treatment is available and infection-control issues arise in hospitals and nursing homes (figure 1). Therefore, during the winter months, we recommend screening by rapid antigen tests for patients who are admitted to the hospital and residents of long-term care facilities who have suspicious clinical syndromes. Once influenza is active in the community, we recommend screening all patients with pneumonia with rapid tests, followed by influenza culture if the results of the rapid test are negative. Full respiratory viral cultures and RT-PCR are desirable to identify other viral pathogens, but if resources are limited, these tests may be restricted to immunocompromised or severely ill patients, for whom use of unproven therapies is sometimes attempted. Because of its retrospective nature, serologic testing is more useful for investigation of nursing home outbreaks of respiratory disease rather than for individual patient care.",
