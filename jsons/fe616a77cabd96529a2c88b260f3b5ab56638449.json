Were some ways of working simply rituals-a legacy of what might have been clinically relevant decades previously, but now with little or no benefit for patients? And now, have we failed to grasp fully the proven or potential impact of molecular pathology on tissue-based diagnosis? Looking back, can we discern a trajectory of progress from which future developments in histopathology can be extrapolated?",

It is now complex, effective and potentially dangerous.' 1 During the 20th century, surgery became safer, but medicine became more dangerous. The increasing safety of surgery over that long timescale was undoubtedly attributable to improvements in anaesthesia, in antisepsis, in surgical techniques, and in perioperative care. In contrast, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) caused by prescribed medicines now account for a significant proportion of hospital admissions, 2 and, in one study, they accounted for~3% of hospital deaths. 3 The scope of the histopathology of ADRs and other iatrogenic conditions is too diverse to be summarized here. Suffice to say that, when ADRs result in morphological changes, they are often diagnostically challenging. Mimicry of naturally occurring diseases is common, and the iatrogenic nature of the problem may become evident only from subtle histological features or from the clinical circumstances.",

On the contrary, histopathology workloads increased massively. For example, in the period 1954-2004 there was an eight-fold increase at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. 7 This inexorable rise in histopathology workloads, especially at a time when many consultant posts in the UK remained unfilled, prompted the Royal College of Pathologists to publish professional guidance on identifying histopathology requests and specimens of limited or no clinical value. 8 An evidence-based approach identified clinical samples that made little or no contribution to patient care, either because biopsy had been superseded by a more informative non-invasive procedure, or because the result was unlikely to influence the patient's treatment. One department estimated that 30% of oesophageal biopsies and >60% of gastric biopsies that it received were of little or no clinical value. 9 If this guidance were put into practice, a significant reduction in workload would result.",

Many new and seemingly rival lymphoma classifications emerged in the ensuing decades, all derived from a greater understanding of the cells populating the lymphoid system.

            "text": "A key factor in advancing knowledge of lymphoma subtypes, and indeed of many other disorders, was the development of the immunoperoxidase 15 and similar immunohistochemical techniques, accompanied subsequently by exquisitely specific monoclonal antibodies. 16 This was a paradigm shift in histopathology, enabling cellular phenotypes to be identified from their molecular signatures. These technical developments were accompanied by a correspondingly sharp fall in the use of electron microscopy for tumour diagnosis. 17 Breast cancer exemplifies well the progressive refinement of histopathological diagnosis. In the 1960s, the grading scheme of Bloom and Richardson became generally accepted for assigning invasive breast carcinomas to different prognostic categories according to the degree of differentiation. 18 Unacceptable levels of reproducibility and consistency led Elston and Ellis to make the grading criteria more objective by semiquantitatively evaluating tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic count; this achieved a much stronger correlation with prognosis. 19 The refined grading scheme further improved the power of the Nottingham Prognostic Index, which integrated tumour grade with two elements of tumour stage-tumour size and lymph node involvement. 20 Recently, progress towards more individualized clinical decisions has come from the inclusion of biomarkers to form the Nottingham Prognostic Index Plus. 21 Molecular pathology has transformed (or has the potential to transform) the tissue-based diagnosis of some neoplasms. In addition to detecting the molecular hallmark of a tumour type (e.g. the fusion gene product resulting from t(X:18) in synovial sarcoma), a tumour's gene expression profile may predict, more powerfully than can histological criteria, a favourable prognosis 22 or, conversely, therapy failure. 23 Purely descriptive diagnoses based solely on morphology, such as small blue round-cell tumour, may well give way to a molecular taxonomy. 24 In addition to the diagnosis and, where possible, grade, the histopathologist's report of tumour biopsies often includes assessment of predictive markers forecasting the likely response to targeted therapy; for example, in breast cancer biopsies, steroid receptor and HER2 status. However, countless prognostic and predictive markers reported in pathology journals have failed to be adopted in clinical practice. All too often, these studies have been performed with insufficient regard to sample size, statistical rigour, and experimental design. In their critical appraisal of cancer prognosis studies, Hall and Going highlighted the deficiencies and limitations of many of these investigations. They proposed a more robust approach comprising, in sequence, assay definition, retrospective testing, and prospective testing, ideally as part of a clinical trial. 25 Since the mid-20th century, histopathologist's reports have grown considerably in length and information content. 26 Formerly, reports of tumour resections were often limited to confirmation of the diagnosis and, by modern standards, rudimentary information about grade and stage. The evidencebased introduction of new and invariably more complex grading and staging, together with meticulous assessment of resection margins, compelled histopathologists to devise better ways of recording and conveying this information. Audits had revealed that clinically important data, capable of influencing treatment and survival, were often omitted from histopathological reports. 27 Template proformas proved to be the best way of ensuring the most complete reporting of these datasets; 28 these proformas have now been widely adopted. ' We look for medicine to be an orderly field of knowledge and procedure. But it is not. It is an imperfect science, an enterprise of constantly changing knowledge, uncertain information, fallible individuals, and at the same time lives on the line. There is science in what we do, yes, but also habit, intuition, and sometimes plain old guessing.' 29 Professionalism underpins the trust that patients have in those who contribute to their care. The greatest need for professionalism in histopathology is often when dealing with doubt, uncertainty, and diagnostic disagreements.",

Problems commonly arise with intrinsically doubtful lesions, such as proliferative lesions that seem to lie on a morphological continuum. Lesions at one end of the apparent continuum are unequivocally benign, whereas those at the other extreme are malignant or, if in situ, at least have the potential to invade. Lesions of uncertain behaviour constitute a nosological conundrum: at which point on the continuum should words such as 'malignant' or 'carcinoma' be applied? The binary benign-versusmalignant paradigm was gradually challenged in the 20th century, partly because apparently intermediate and ultimately indeterminate lesions were often picked up in screening programmes, notably for breast cancer. In 1995, Elliott Foucar questioned whether the terminology for such lesions could remain safely in the hands of pathologists-'The pathology monopoly on nosology has become dysfunctional. Pathologists' inability to move beyond their benign vs malignant paradigm should result in loss of their terminology monopoly.' 30 Fortunately, histopathologists have not been deprived of their leading, but collaborative, role in disease classification and nomenclature, exemplified by the authoritative series of 'Blue Books' comprising the World Health Organization/International Agency for Research on Cancer Classification of Tumours, a project established in 1956.",

Formerly, there may have been a tendency to be as decisive as possible (either benign or malignant), and only later for an erroneously benign diagnosis to require correction when metastases appeared or vice versa. Now it is widely accepted that some lesions of dubious behaviour are best labelled 'as 'borderline' or having 'uncertain malignant potential'. In fact, as long ago as 1929, such entities were labelled 'semimalignant'. 31 Codifying uncertainty in this way highlights a continuing need for further work to improve the clinical predictiveness of histopathological diagnoses.",

Technical and analytical EQA in other pathology specialties was introduced with comparatively little difficulty, because, first, the results being compared between laboratories were usually numerical, and second, deviant results were likely to be attributed to a reagent or machine. In contrast, histopathological EQA schemes were initially difficult to initiate and organize, because the results being compared were interpretive diagnoses, and outlier opinions would be attributed to an individual. 32 Nevertheless, participation in EQA aligned to the scope of a histopathologist's practice is now firmly established, including the procedures for dealing with persistently poor performance.",

Although many patients are unaware of the histopathologist's role in their care, from their perspective the histopathologists' experience and expertise, and therefore their specific diagnostic competence, is vital. This is far removed from the situation in the 1960s in the UK and elsewhere: other than in teaching hospitals, the pathology service was often the responsibility of a single general pathologist. 33 Credentialing subspecialty expertise in many medical and surgical specialties usually occurs on certified completion of training. In contrast, in the UK, other than for neuropathology, forensic pathology, and paediatric pathology, subspecialty competence in histopathology is more loosely recognized. Some weight must be given to participation in continuing professional development and EQA aligned with the individual's diagnostic repertoire. The individual's workload must also be sufficiently large to be reliably audited and to ensure familiarity with the range of problems likely to be encountered, but not so burdensome that difficult cases receive insufficient attention.",

Is it now just a matter of applying the knowledge accumulated thus far, while the battle against disease advances on a new frontier-molecular pathology? In an era of stratified and personalized medicine, is the role of morphological histopathology now rather limited? 45 Crucially, as molecular profiling of tumours proves beneficial to patients, should the results separately influence clinical decisions, or should they be blended with morphology as an integral part of the histopathologist's repertoire and responsibility? 46 In 2017, we are not witnessing the end of histopathology or even the beginning of its end, but we could be at the end of the specialty's beginning.",
