Self-reported isolation population refers to people who reported self-isolation but did not meet the four conditions of medical isolation. A total of 76.7% of the medically isolated population reported difficulty to fall asleep at least once over the week preceding the survey, while the corresponding rates among self-reported isolation (51.0%) and non-reported isolation groups (42.3%) were significantly lower. Likewise, the rate of early wake-up at least once over the week preceding the survey (79.5%) was highest among the medically isolated group (Fig. 1 ).",

The prevalence of sleep problems was high during the first two weeks of medical isolation and decreased thereafter (Figs. 2 and 3). In conclusion, sleep problems were found to be prominent among the medically-isolated population, which may be due to fear of infection, suggesting that medically isolated individuals require appropriate psychological intervention.
