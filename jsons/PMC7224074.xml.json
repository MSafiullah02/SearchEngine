By definition, all PA students are in their first two years of training, representing a potentially insightful cohort and a fresh pair of eyes through which to view the practice and teaching of clinical empathy. Furthermore, they represent a hitherto untapped potential: there are no previous studies of empathy which focus on PA students. It is for these reasons, and underlined by the belief that the understanding of clinical empathy stands to benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, that we chose to focus on PA students for the purpose of this study.",

When patients sense empathy from their clinician, they report greater satisfaction with the consultation; they are also more concordant with treatment and likely to enjoy better health outcomes [5, 6]. Whilst its humanist importance is not in doubt, empathy presents a series of not inconsiderable challenges to researchers and educators alike. As a complex and multi-faceted construct, it is difficult to define. Most definitions will utilise cognitive, affective or action components but there is considerable disagreement around the relative importance of these\u2014for example, some definitions omit to mention an affective element altogether [7].",

            "text": "Educators face the paradox that despite efforts to teach it, there is research to suggest empathy actually declines in medical students, especially from the third year onwards [8, 9]. More recent evidence suggests this decline may be specific to some geo-sociocultural settings, being more generally observed in Western studies in the USA and UK (this study is UK based) [10]. However, the entire endeavour of measuring empathy is not without challenge or controversy. Most empathy scales rely on self-reporting, which may be unreliable, and few are validated against patient experience [11]. Qualitative studies, which could further refine our understanding of empathy, are outnumbered by quantitative papers. Pedersen\u2019s extensive review of 209 publications [12] contained only 33 qualitative studies and, in 24 of these, empathy was peripheral to the main focus of the study. Given these limitations, researchers have called for studies to shed greater light on the nature and mechanisms of clinical empathy [12, 13], to better understand the empathic influences that students are exposed to, which this study aims to do. The research question guiding this study is as follows: how do PA students characterise the practice and teaching of clinical empathy? In exploring this question, our objectives are to refine our understanding of how clinical empathy is practised and taught, to propose a model to outline this and to suggest practice points for educators.",

The settings are two UK medical schools, Hull York Medical School (HYMS) and Sheffield Medical School, running PA courses since 2016 and 2015 respectively. Institutional ethical approval was gained (Approval Ref: HYMS 1818). Two centres were chosen to increase the potential recruitment pool and improve the transferability of results. Inevitably, much of the existing empathy research that informs our study is based on medical students and doctors and there are likely to be significant differences between these groups and PA students, in terms of both professional identity and career trajectories. Cognisant of this, in attempting to minimise such differences, we chose two centres which educate PAs within the medical school (some UK PA courses are in universities that don\u2019t have medical schools). Furthermore, as both courses are relatively new, being established within the last 5 years, and as PA is a relatively new profession in the UK, the PA students were subject to very few PA role models, the great majority of their tutors and supervisors were medical doctors\u2014they were much more frequently witnessing physician rather than PA empathy. In this sense, even though we were researching PA students rather than medical students, we were none-the-less interviewing a group of students who could inform us of the influences that medical school has on empathy. Sampling was purposive, targeting PA students undertaking regular clinical placement sessions to ensure they had the opportunity to observe empathy in practice (years 1 and 2 at HYMS and year 2 in Sheffield). Recruitment was through email, posters and word of mouth.",

For example, it became apparent after the first few interviews that the influence of time was seen as a key factor, and the questions were adapted to accommodate this. Question stems (Table 1) were kept as open as possible but were informed by current literature. Interviews were conducted face-to-face, or via online video or telephone depending on student preference. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Focus groups were considered, but given the confidential nature of patient encounters and the potentially sensitive subject of discussing negative supervisor role models, one-to-one interviews were preferred.",

In particular, although clinical empathy lacks any universally accepted conceptual model, there is general agreement that it comprises cognitive, affective and behavioural components [4, 7]. This was a sensitising concept for data collection and analysis, providing the broad conceptual framework for exploring empathy\u2014it therefore informed our questions and analysis.

Whilst this reflects the gender ratios within the PA student cohorts, it may also bias the results. There is some evidence to suggest female clinicians are more empathic than their male counterparts [18]. Although there was diversity within the study group, almost three quarters of the sample identified as White British and all three researchers are also White British: the practice of empathy has ethnic and cultural considerations [19], limiting the transferability of these results.",

For a construct with such broad disciplinary horizons, it would be a disservice to characterise it in terms of a simple dichotomy between head and heart\u2014it is more nuanced than that\u2014but definitions of clinical empathy undeniably polarise around the degree to which it is a cognitive or affective endeavour [20]. The cognitive approach is rooted in the traditional wariness of the medical profession to engage emotionally with patients, encapsulated by Fox and Lief in the philosophy of \u2018detached concern\u2019 [21]. Detachment is deemed necessary to avoid the clouding of logical judgment and the problem of compassion fatigue. The evidence for the latter is in actuality, conflicting: some research suggests the most empathic doctors are at the greatest risk of emotional burnout [22, 23], whilst other research indicates the most empathic clinicians are also the most resilient [24]. Proponents of the affective approach argue that empathy without feeling is no kind of empathy at all. The word itself originates from the German word \u2018Ein-f\u00fchlung\u2019, meaning \u2018in feeling\u2019. Rather than detachment, emotional resonance is advocated as the means to a sincere empathic practice [20]. Larson and Yao, conceptualising empathy as a type of \u2018emotional labour\u2019, invoke a theatrical metaphor to illustrate the difference between the two approaches, likening cognitive empathy to surface acting and affective empathy to deep acting, a method used by actors to feel emotionally as their character would, and to use the emotions to drive the performance [25].",

PA students acknowledge the perils of burning out; reporting cognitive empathy is used as a potential solution to this. Students also see cognitive empathy as a solution to the pressures of time. There is remarkably little in the literature about empathy and time, but primary care research indicates more time leads to higher patient-perceived empathy in GP consultations [26]. It is also clear, however, that students see an affective component in empathy, the lack of which is noticed in sensitive situations like breaking bad news. As our conceptual model (Fig. 1) illustrates, students in this study see affective empathy as a more widely encompassing process, practised not just with words but with compassionate actions. By contrast, cognitive empathy has a narrower compass and is associated with levels of artifice, of \u2018playing\u2019 the empathic role, and playing it with surface rather than deep acting [25]. Students in this study aspire to affective empathy. Yet, remarkably, definitions of empathy sans feeling are commonplace in medical literature. In one review, only a quarter of studies that defined empathy included a feeling dimension and some specifically excluded it13. Our results challenge this, and our message to educators is to avoid teaching a purely cognitive empathy, for that is to limit the concept.",

Even if students and clinicians can learn to simulate empathy in a way that convinces patients, there remains the problem that the students and clinicians themselves know they are being less than genuine in their approach, which could inversely impact on professional satisfaction [25]. Although others have written about fake empathy [25, 27], this is the first paper to encapsulate the problem it causes to students in terms of an empathic dissonance. We see it as a symptom of over-reliance on the empathic statement at the cost of more natural empathic communication, especially non-verbal communication.

            "text": "In conclusion, our data lend support to the notion that clinical empathy is practiced both in cognitive and affective ways, with affective empathy being the deeper, more embracing form (Fig. 1). We have identified modifying factors, including barriers which either militate against empathy or promote cognitive over affective empathy, and chief amongst these is the pressure of time, which is currently under researched. We have also identified that medical communication teaching and OSCE assessment place an inherent emphasis on the empathic statement as the means to deliver empathy, despite students themselves preferring non-verbal approaches. Furthermore, this drive towards the empathic statement leaves students uncomfortable about feeling the need to force empathic statements at times when they are not feeling them\u2014essentially practising empathy is a less than sincere way. We have termed this discomfort empathic dissonance, a novel concept in medical educational, and one which warrants further study. For those looking for practical implications, based on our findings, we propose five key practice points for educators (Table 3).",
