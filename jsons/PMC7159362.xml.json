            "text": "With a wide range of clinical presentations, respiratory tract infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in children [Henrickson et al., 2004; Johansson et al., 2011]. Although many pathogens may cause respiratory tract infections, viruses are the most frequently implicated. Respiratory tract infections have a significant socioeconomic impact due to work and school absenteeism, despite mostly having a mild and self\u2010limiting clinical course [Bramley et al., 2002; Fendrick et al., 2003]. Annual winter epidemics of severe respiratory infections in infants and young children are caused by a range of respiratory viruses. To date, identification of the causative pathogen in respiratory tract infections has mainly been limited to clinical research studies, and routine testing has yet to become common in general practice.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), and seasonal influenza viruses are responsible for a significant majority of viral respiratory illnesses in humans worldwide, which in turn place a heavy burden on healthcare systems. RSV causes mainly infections in young children and infants, typically as an epidemic during midwinter, particularly in temperate regions. It is estimated that 70% of children are infected before they reach the age of 1 year, with affected individuals usually presenting with bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, bronchitis, or croup [Glezen et al., 1986]. The influenza viruses, on the other hand, are known to cause yearly epidemics, especially during the winter months. They normally give rise to a systemic illness with high fever, myalgia, and a dry cough which may be life\u2010threatening in high\u2010risk groups such as the elderly or those with chronic cardio\u2010respiratory conditions. Although the initial infection itself can be quite debilitating, there is also the risk of acquiring a secondary bacterial superinfection. The common cold, which is the most frequent form respiratory tract infections, is caused mainly by the HRV. Infection may progress rarely to pneumonia or lead to exacerbation of asthma in children [Pierangeli et al., 2007; Matthew et al., 2009]. The human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is also known to cause respiratory tract infection in children and adults, accounting for approximately 5\u201310% of cases annually [van den Hoogen et al., 2001]. Other viruses such as human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), human coronaviruses HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010OC43 have also been implicated worldwide. Discovered recently, human coronavirus HCoV\u2010NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] and human bocavirus (HBoV) [Allander et al., 2007] have joined the family of viruses that cause respiratory tract infections.",

The overall detection rate of a respiratory virus in our study population was 52%, a value that is slightly higher than previously reported rates of 37% and 48% [Druce et al., 2005; Brittain\u2010Long et al., 2008]. This difference could be attributed to variations in age, seasonality, environmental factors, and socio\u2010economic status. Patients enrolled in this study were indeed younger, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained during the peak season for respiratory tract infections, both of which are factors known to increase diagnostic yield. Furthermore, the PCR assays performed in this study allowed for the detection of a wider variety of viruses, including HBoV, HCoV\u2010OC43, NL63, and HMP, which improves detection rate. Underdeveloped immunity and prolonged viral shedding are believed to be the main contributing factors for the higher incidence of viral respiratory tract infections in children [Jartti et al., 2004; Naghipour et al., 2009; To et al., 2010]. Furthermore, unlike adults, young children tend to be brought to medical attention earlier in the course of disease, and it has been established that the detection rate with RT\u2010PCR is correlated inversely with the duration of symptoms [Brittain\u2010Long et al., 2010].",

A comparison of presenting age between viral pathogens revealed patients with RSV to be significantly younger than patients with HRV, influenza A, and influenza B (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Khamis et al. [2012] observed in community\u2010based study that RSV infection occurred solely in children aged less than 2 years of age, with 57% of infections occurring in infants younger than 6 months. The oldest patient with RSV in the present study was a 67\u2010month\u2010old child, and only 4 (25%) out of 16 patients with documented RSV were older than 2 years of age. Additionally, an influenza virus was detected in nearly two\u2010thirds of patients who were included in the virally infected group, with an overall frequency in children with influenza\u2010like illnesses of 32%. In this research group's study from last influenza season, influenza viruses were detected in 129 of 300 patients (43%) with influenza\u2010like illnesses [Ceyhan et al., 2012]. While the H1N1 strain of influenza A was predominant last season, it has been replaced this season by the H3N2 strain as well as influenza B. Other viruses that were detected this season were RSV, HRV, HBoV, HCoV, and MPV. The present study shows that it may not be possible to distinguish between influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses in patients with influenza\u2010like illnesses based on symptoms alone, since all the respiratory pathogens evaluated have the potential to cause a febrile illness in affected children during the influenza season.",

On the contrary, nearly one\u2010third of infants with respiratory viral infections present with symptoms such as tachypnea, wheezing, severe cough, breathlessness, and respiratory distress, suggestive of lower respiratory tract involvement [Pavia, 2011]. In this study, 23% of patients who had a positive RT\u2010PCR result had lower respiratory symptoms, whereas the most frequently encountered symptoms were cough (92.1%), rhinorrhea (92.1%), fever (84.3%), nasal congestion (83.3%), headache (25.3%), and myalgia (24.5%). The presence of a significant difference between viral pathogens in terms of frequency and duration of symptoms is also demonstrated. Fever and headache were observed more commonly in patients with infections due to the influenza viruses compared to other viruses, while the duration of symptoms such as fever, cough, rhinorrhea and nasal congestion was also significantly longer with influenza virus infections. In this group's recent study during the last influenza season [Ceyhan et al., 2012], it was also observed that the duration of symptoms such as cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea in influenza positive patients were longer than those reported in the previous season, with no significant difference in the duration of fever.

However, it has been postulated that multiple viral infections may be associated with higher fever, longer durations of hospital stay, more frequent use of antibiotics and increased risk of requiring intensive care in a hospital\u2010based study [Semple et al., 2005].

Male gender, low socioeconomic status, exposure to cigarette smoke or animals, history of breastfeeding, presence of a co\u2010morbidity such as asthma, chronic heart disease or iron deficiency anemia have all been linked with an increased risk of RSV infection. Data on risk factors for other viral pathogens are limited. In a recent study on an adult population, cigarette smoking was found to be associated with higher mortality in patients with influenza [Wong et al., 2013]. In the present study, younger age and daycare/school attendance were linked with an increased likelihood of having a viral pathogen (P < 0.005). In contrast, a history of household smoking, another house member with similar symptoms, and siblings attending school/daycare did not seem to be significantly associated with an increased risk for respiratory infection with a viral etiology (P > 0.05, for all).",

            "text": "Common respiratory viruses usually show typical seasonal distribution in temperate climates. The best examples are RSV, influenza A, and occasionally HMPV, which usually peak during the winter months [Stensballe et al., 2003; Monto, 2004; du Prel et al., 2009]. In a previous study from India, a similar pattern for influenza A and RSV has been observed [Agrawal et al., 2009]. An age distribution leaning toward a young age for RSV infections during winter may be attributed to an actual high incidence as well as increased parental awareness. It has long been established through several observational studies that the seasonal incidence of many respiratory viruses is influenced by weather conditions. The incidence of RSV infections has been found to be correlated inversely with average temperature, while a significant positive association between the incidence of HRV infections and increased humidity has also been reported [du Prel et al., 2009]. During the 5\u2010month follow\u2010up period in this study, influenza A cases were seen mostly in the months of December and January, with no further cases after February. On the other hand, the first case of influenza B was detected in January, with the number of new cases peaking in March. Cases of RSV and HRV presented in each month of the influenza season studied.",

However, it is believed that potential bias was minimized since the goal was to enroll all patients presenting to the outpatient clinic during the 5\u2010month study period, provided consent was given. Another limitation is that children with respiratory tract infections due to bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were not excluded from the study, which may have affected the calculated detection rates.",

Among the patients, the influenza viruses were the most frequently detected viruses (62.8%), with non\u2010influenza viruses responsible for the remaining 37.2% of cases. Taking the overall viral pathogen detection rate of 51% into consideration, it is obvious to conclude that other respiratory pathogens, whether viral or bacterial, also lead to respiratory tract infections related hospital visits in children.",
