Generally there are fewer colds in the warm summer months and more colds during periods of crowding, particularly the fall. In spite of the nomenclature, exposure to cold temperatures per se does not seem to be a significant factor in cold epidemiology. Folklore is somewhat at odds with modern science over this issue; there are many cultures where youngsters who have a \u201ccold\u201d are dressed sufficiently to keep them warm on the coldest winter night, even when the outside temperature is tropical.",

Coronaviruses also appear to be responsible for a large percentage of colds, but precisely what that percentage is compared with parainfluenza or respiratory syncytial viruses has not yet been well established. Certain viruses appear to be more common in children than adults, but in general, viruses appear in roughly the same proportions in both populations. Some viruses may be associated with more severe symptoms than others, for example, the exacerbation of asthma seen with respiratory syncytial virus. However, the most significant factor in the severity of a viral infection seems to be the incubation period.4\n",

In assessing the differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with confirmed viral infections, Stoneet al.5 found a correlation between the manifestation of colds and life events involving major stress. Cohen et al.6 found an association similar to a dose-response between psychologic stress and increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness; the risk involved increased rates of infections rather than frequency of symptoms after infection. Smokers are at greater risk than nonsmokers to develop both infections and symptoms after infection.6 It also appears that certain drugs may increase susceptibility to colds. Aspirin and acetaminophen suppress sero-neutralizing antibody response (p < 0.05) and are associated with increased nasal symptoms and signs. There is a trend towards longer duration of virus shedding with both of these medications.7\n",

When these mediators accumulate along with polymorphonuclear cells, there is an increase in nasal symptoms.13 Since bradykinin is a likely mediator,14 we might expect that a bradykinin antagonist would be a useful treatment. It is therefore somewhat surprising that a study of a bradykinin antagonist in rhinovirus infections failed to demonstrate any positive results; the lack of effect may have been related to the dose administered.15 Hsia et al.16 postulated the activation of a systemic cellular immune response with a URI. For example, they found that a blastogenic response to the rhinovirus challenge correlated directly with mucus production (p < 0.05) and the number of days the virus was cultured from nasal washings (p < 0.05). Skoner et al.17 also found induction of specific and nonspecific systemic cellular responses with a unique response pattern in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Production of interleukin-1 from nasal lavage fluid after rhinovirus infection is also thought to contribute to pathogenesis.18 These interactions, as reviewed by Sperber and Hayden,19 are seen in Fig. 1.",

Dockhorn, unpublished data) (Table II). Although Doyle et al.24 reported no increase in nasal responsiveness to an infectious trigger in allergic compared with nonallergic individuals, Bardin et al.25 found that patients with allergic rhinitis had more severe colds independent of preinnoculation antibody.

Antihistamine/decongestants do not appear to be effective in the treatment of URIs in children.32, 33 Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil have both been studied; they do not cause a worsening of symptoms, but neither do they seem to provide any significant improvement.34, 35 Apparently menthol cannot be positively demonstrated to provide a beneficial effect.36 Interferon has been used in various studies with negative results.37, 38, 39 Either intranasal or systemic steroids may suppress inflammation during the first days of infection, and would seem to merit further investigation.40 Among the many nonpharmacologic therapies, steam has been shown by various authors to provide no beneficial effect;41, 42 however, with proper timing, local hyperthermia43 or sauna44 may decrease the incidence of colds or provide slight relief. In general, the use of zinc has been disappointing and is associated with side effects.45 Godfrey et al.46 commented on the poor bioavailability of the older zinc products and found a statistically significant decrease in the duration of colds with their nonchelated formulations. Vitamin C may decrease the duration of cold symptoms.47, 48 Of course, chicken soup is well known to provide benefit in the common cold (as long as it is one's mother's). In answer to the cynics who doubt such an assertion, chicken soup has been demonstrated to improve mucociliary clearance.49\n",
