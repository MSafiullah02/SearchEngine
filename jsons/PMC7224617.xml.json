We used ICD-9 code 812.41 and corresponding ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes to identify a consecutive series of patients who presented to the emergency department with a closed supracondylar humeral fracture. During our study period, from 2012 to February 2020, 1,343 (50.4%) of 2,665 patients underwent operative fixation of supracondylar humeral fractures.",

Both deep infections (i.e., subperiosteal abscess, osteomyelitis, and/or need for long-term antibiotics [>7 days]) and pin-track infections were recorded. For the purposes of this study, we defined clinically relevant pin-track infections as requiring early pin removal, return to the operating room, and/or oral antibiotics (i.e., any possible superficial pin-track infection that improved with routine hygiene or did not require formal treatment [e.g., antibiotics] was not included).

Additionally, 1 surgeon (D.P.D.) in the semisterile group performed these procedures without a mask, and we therefore chose to further analyze patients who had the procedure with and without a masked surgeon. In brief, the semisterile technique involves using 3 or 4 sterile towels to isolate and prepare only the exposed elbow after reduction is confirmed on fluoroscopy, prior to draping or toweling. An iodine povacrylex and isopropanol surgical antiseptic applicator (DuraPrep; 3M) is then used to sterilize the area of interest. Sterile gloves are worn, but a surgical gown is not (Fig. 1). If anatomic reduction is not obtained and an open procedure is needed, conversion to a full sterile preparation can easily be performed prior to any cutaneous incision. Pins are then inserted percutaneously in the routine fashion. The procedure may be performed by a single surgeon or with an assistant using sterile gloves. The sterile cohort was cared for by 7 surgeons using a traditional operating room setup with surgical drapes and the surgeon gowned, gloved, and masked (Fig. 2). All other elements of care were standardized, and all patients received a single dose of preoperative intravenous antibiotics.",

We conservatively accounted for a savings of 1 drape, 2 gowns, and 2 masks per case (surgical technician and surgeon). Therefore, savings of $98.20 per case and associated PPE preservation could be expected by utilizing a semisterile technique. Additionally, we used data from the literature to roughly estimate savings associated with decreased operating room time using the semisterile technique, which is known to be 10 minutes9. The cost per minute of operating room time was estimated conservatively at $30 based on prior literature14.",

Assuming that all providers are using a full sterile technique, conversion to a semisterile technique could result in substantial cost savings. Using our cost data, financial savings from only drapes, gown, and masks equates to annual hospital cost savings of between $913,849 and $1,088,154. When considering the 10 minutes of operating room time savings per case9, an additional savings of $300 per case would be expected14. Extrapolated to the national volume of CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, this could save $2.8 million to $3.3 million annually. Summative, annual savings of between $3.7 million and $4.4 million could therefore be expected in the United States. Additionally, national adoption of this technique could account for important PPE preservation including (conservatively) between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks annually in the United States, for this procedure alone.",

Further, even the rare pin-track infection that occurs regardless of adherence to traditional sterility measures is typically of limited clinical importance, often resolving with only daily hygiene15-18.

Many bedside procedures, such as suture repair of traumatic lacerations, application of skeletal or cervical traction, or joint aspiration or injection, are frequently performed without the use of a mask or full sterile preparation. Under typical circumstances, the cost of perfunctory use of full preparation with gowns and drapes for CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures (or any of these bedside procedures) is not inconsequential, but, in the pandemic landscape, this may unnecessarily burden a system desperate for PPE to protect health-care providers treating a virulent infectious agent11,20,21.",

Although a large series was published by a group from Turkey, that study had no comparison group and the procedures were performed predominantly by trainees10. That group also reported atypically high complication rates (7.3% pin-track infections, 8.3% iatrogenic nerve injury, and 11.5% loss of reduction), despite no deep infections10. Therefore, our contemporary, large, single-institution series clarifies the remaining gaps from the prior literature and expands on the potential for cost savings and resource preservation. Given the existing series, it seems that the semisterile technique is safe and could save millions of dollars annually. Importantly, this is also an opportunity for PPE resource preservation under normal circumstances. A nationwide adoption of this policy will diminish costs and enable resource reallocation. Despite our findings, surgeons should still strictly adhere to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regulations of self-protection in the operating room, as this study was conducted during non-pandemic times22.",

            "text": "Although our study has multiple strengths, there were also weaknesses that must be addressed. First, given the retrospective nature of this study, causality could not be determined. Second, the rate of deep infection following CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture was exceedingly low8. To be sufficiently powered to detect even a doubling of the infection rate between cohorts (with an infection rate of 0.47%), nearly 5,000 patients per group would be required. Although our series is, to our knowledge, the largest reported on the subject from the United States and our zero infections in the semisterile cohort is reassuring, this study should serve as the impetus for a larger, multi-institution study powered to detect differences in infectious outcomes. Third, we excluded fractures managed nonoperatively. The potential benefits of CRPP for Type-II fractures, especially those without medial comminution, should be carefully assessed and cautiously weighed against the risk of operative intervention. Our belief is that many less-displaced Type-II fractures may be successfully managed with closed treatment while more-displaced fractures should undergo CRPP to prevent malunion7,23. Additionally, our cost estimates are based on institutional data, which may limit external validity. To improve generalizability, we used estimated, per minute, operating room costs24 and favored conservative estimates14. Further, foregoing mask wear would be contrary to the CDC recommendations25 during pandemic situations and is therefore not recommended at this time. Although children seem to have a low risk of severe symptomatic disease, they can be asymptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, and our data do not permit definitively commenting on the safety of the surgeon when foregoing PPE during the COVID-19 era26. However, the reduction of surgeon PPE does not appear to increase postoperative infections. Lastly, exposure data in this series were self-reported, which is known to be subject to bias27.",

This study highlights the fact that an arbitrary approach to sterility may need reevaluation during these unique times. As previously noted, the CDC recommends surgical mask use. However, surgeons should reevaluate whether gowns are necessary for all procedures. Although surgical gowns are not traditionally used as frontline PPE, unprecedented shortages have necessitated creative, if not questionable, measures to protect vulnerable providers, and we hope that the reallocations proposed in this study both contribute to our health-care system and stimulate further efforts. In the long term, the semisterile technique affords resource stewardship and portends substantial national cost savings. Given these advantages of the semisterile technique, without obvious associated patient risk, we advocate for adoption of the semisterile technique for CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, especially during current relief efforts. We encourage others to closely review their procedures to look for similar opportunities to identify areas where conservation efforts could lessen the burden on the health-care system now and in the future.",
