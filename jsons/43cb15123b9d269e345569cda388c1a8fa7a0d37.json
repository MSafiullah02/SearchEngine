There were also concerns that aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel would increase bleeding complications in patients undergoing urgent CEA.",

Prasad et al. 3 based on a meta-analysis Q1 of three RCTs 4 (CHANCE, 5 POINT 6 & FASTER 7 ) in which 10,447 patients were randomised within 24 h of experiencing a minor ischaemic stroke (NIHSS 3) 5\u00c07 or 'high-risk TIA' (defined as an ABCD 2 score !4) 5,6 to aspirin monotherapy or shortterm aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel combination therapy, recommended in a BMJ Rapid Guidelines document that there was now compelling evidence to support short-term treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in these patient subgroups. 3 This fundamental change in recommendation, towards more routine prescription of short-term DAPT in patients with TIA or minor stroke, assumes even greater relevance due to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is currently wreaking havoc on health systems around the world. Health Providers have had to radically reconfigure the way hospitals work, including converting some operating theatres into Intensive Care facilities. This, inevitably, will have a 'knock on' effect on the ability to perform elective and even urgent surgical interventions, including carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) has established a series of online surveys of vascular surgical practice around the world to gauge the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on workflow. Between 23rd March and 5th April 2020, 249 centres reported on the impact of the pandemic on carotid surgery practice. Just under half of the centres (42%) were still able to follow national/international guidelines and have not changed practice. However, 45% of centres indicated that they were now treating most recently symptomatic patients with TIA or minor stroke with 'best medical therapy' (after multidisciplinary team review), 12% said they would only offer CEA to patients with 'crescendo' symptoms, while 1% entered 'other strategy' (Thanos Saratzis; personal communication). It is, therefore, essential that these patients really do receive 'best medical therapy'.",

Given that patients being treated with CAS are now routinely prescribed aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel prior to any intervention, DAPT should be started as soon as possible prior to CAS, as advised in the ESVS guidelines. 1 The debate, therefore, moves to patients being considered for optimal medical therapy (including centres unable to perform CEA due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and in those patients who are still able to undergo expedited CEA. There are three scenarios where a surgeon/vascular neurologist/stroke physician may be faced with a patient presenting with high-risk TIA/minor ischaemic stroke, where early institution of DAPT (rather than antiplatelet monotherapy) may now be the preferred treatment strategy: (1) 0e49% stenosis with no other mechanism for TIA/stroke on comprehensive neurovascular work-up; (2) recent TIA/ stroke plus a 50e99% stenosis, where CEA/CAS is definitely not being considered (patient fitness, patient preference or due to the Covid-19 pandemic); and (3) recent TIA/stroke plus a 50e99% stenosis where urgent CEA is planned.

Patients could then be treated with clopidogrel 75 mg daily and aspirin 162e325 mg daily from days 2e7, followed by clopidogrel 75 mg daily and aspirin 75e81 mg daily during days 8e21. Thereafter, patients revert to long-term monotherapy with clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

Furthermore, in patients with 50e 99% symptomatic stenosis (at much higher risk of recurrent vascular events) in whom a decision has been made not to undergo CEA/CAS and in whom clopidogrel is contraindicated, an alternative strategy would be to prescribe aspirin 300e325 mg daily from day 1e14 and then reduce the long-term aspirin dose to 75e81 mg daily, in combination with full-dose dipyridamole MR 200 mg BD from day 1, once tolerated.

If the surgeon is happy to perform expedited CEA on aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel DAPT, parenchymal haemorrhage should first be excluded on CT/MRI and then the patient should be commenced on aspirin 300e325 mg stat (if not already on aspirin), followed by aspirin 75e81 mg daily, in combination with clopidogrel 75 mg daily from day 1 (without a 300 mg loading dose). Expedited CEA, with very careful control of post-operative blood pressure should be performed, because uncontrolled post-CEA hypertension increases the risk of hyperperfusion syndrome, intracranial haemorrhage and neck haematoma formation. 1 Aspirin can then be stopped on day 1 after CEA and clopidogrel 75 mg daily continued indefinitely, unless contraindicated. 8 Whilst CHANCE, POINT and FASTER only included patients within 24 h of symptom onset, if one is certain that the surgeon will perform expedited CEA on aspirin and clopidogrel, it seems reasonable to start DAPT if patients present >24 h after TIA/minor stroke onset, especially within the first 10 days, when the risk of early recurrent stroke is highest. It is also important to prescribe gastric protection with proton pump inhibitors that do not interact with clopidogrel (e.g. pantoprazole) in patients prescribed DAPT, to reduce GI bleeding complications, as per ESVS guidelines. 1 If the surgeon is not happy to perform CEA on aspirin and clopidogrel, an alternative would be to prescribe aspirin 300e325 mg daily from day 1e14 and then reduce the long-term aspirin dose to 75e81 mg daily, in combination with dipyridamole MR 200 mg twice daily from day 1, with advice regarding potential side effects. 2 This regimen was as effective at reducing micro-emboli as aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel in patients with a !50% recently symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis with micro-emboli on transcranial Doppler ultrasound. 14 However, one must accept that there are limited data on the risk of peri-CEA bleeding complications with aspirin \u00fe dipyridamole therapy.",

Antiplatelet-HTPR is a potential risk factor for vascular events on antiplatelet therapy, but no studies (to date) have been adequately powered to definitively comment on whether ex vivo HTPR status predicts the risk of clinical outcome events in asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid stenosis patients in the peri-operative or non-peri-operative phase. 16e19 The prevalence of antiplatelet-HTPR is also positively influenced by the shear stress levels to which platelets are exposed in the ex vivo platelet function testing platform in question. 19 Accordingly, further studies are required to determine whether one could optimise secondary prevention with the use of personalised antiplatelet regimens which are tailored to suit individual patients with carotid stenosis based on their antiplatelet-HTPR status. 17e19 The first 7e14 days after onset of symptoms remains the highest risk period for experiencing a recurrent stroke after the index event Historically, vascular surgeons may not really have considered the prevention of recurrent stroke prior to a final decision regarding the need for CEA as being their primary responsibility, but this needs to change. There is now compelling RCT evidence that early institution of aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel significantly reduces early recurrent stroke after a high-risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke and that aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel DAPT only needs to be continued for 21 days. There is also increasing anecdotal evidence that a growing body of surgeons are now more willing to perform expedited CEA on aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel DAPT. This should not only reduce rates of early recurrent stroke prior to CEA, but aspirin \u00fe clopidogrel DAPT may also reduce early post-operative thrombotic stroke as well. 20 Whilst the Covid-19 pandemic has led to sometimes radical (and seemingly unthinkable) changes in practice, regarding the ability to perform urgent CEA in many centres, it is now even more important that any patient with a high-risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke due to a recently symptomatic 50e99% carotid stenosis who is unable to undergo CEA/CAS be started on short-term aspirin-clopidogrel DAPT or long-term aspirin-dipyridamole combination therapy as soon as possible. Once the pandemic subsides, surgeons will still have to face the question as to how to optimise antiplatelet therapy in recently symptomatic patients prior to CEA. Direct and indirect evidence suggests that the strategies outlined above should confer overall benefit to the patient, without significantly increasing haemorrhagic risks associated with carotid intervention.",
