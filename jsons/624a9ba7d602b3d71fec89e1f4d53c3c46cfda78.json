            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) commonly causes adult hospitalization, and viruses account for many of these illnesses [1] [2] [3] [4] . Increased availability of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays allows clinical laboratories to rapidly detect a wide variety of respiratory viruses [5, 6] . Despite viral detection, most patients in US hospitals receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, partly because of concerns about bacterial coinfection [7] [8] [9] . Reports from Europe suggest that elevated serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels predict bacterial infection and that PCT algorithms can be used to safely guide antibiotic use in LRTI, resulting in significant reductions in antibiotic duration [10, 11] . However, PCT-based treatment algorithms for respiratory infections have not been widely adopted in the United States [12] [13] [14] . In a prior study of adults hospitalized with respiratory illnesses, we showed that viral infection was common and that, of those with viruses, 60% had no evidence of bacterial infection, although most received antibiotics [15] . Results of a post-hoc physician survey indicated a perception that serum biomarkers coupled with viral testing would be most helpful to guide antibiotic decisions. Nevertheless, confidence in PCT-guided algorithms among US physicians will likely be an iterative process. Moreover, because early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics is recommended by professional societies for patients hospitalized with pneumonia and mandated in clinical practice, the potential to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use in the setting of viral LRTI is likely greatest in the population of patients without clinical and diagnostic evidence of a definite pneumonic process. We therefore believe that initial US clinical trials for PCTguided care of LRTI should focus on persons at lower risk for invasive bacterial disease and without definitive pneumonia. Thus, we investigated the feasibility of conducting PCT-based algorithm trials in a US hospital and the value of concurrent viral testing to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in adults hospitalized with nonpneumonic LRTI.",

Although overall antibiotic exposure was similar in the intervention and nonintervention arms, subgroup analyses and comparison with historical controls were encouraging because they suggested that US physicians will respond to viral and biomarker data to inform antibiotic use. The primary goal of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting randomized clinical trials of PCT-guided antibiotic recommendations in the United States. Our data clearly indicate that such trials are likely to be well received, since complete enrollment was achieved 5 months early. Evidence is mounting that PCT-guided treatment of respiratory infections can safely reduce antibiotic use [10, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . European trials have been performed in a variety of settings, including emergency departments, primary care offices, hospitals, and ICUs [10, 16, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In all prior studies, antibiotic use was decreased without harm, as measured by composite adverse event outcomes. The largest trial to date was a Swiss multicenter randomized trial of PCT-guided therapy in 1359 hospitalized patients with LRTI [16] . A 35% decrease in overall antibiotic exposure was reported without notable differences in short-term or long-term outcomes. Currently, use of PCT levels in the United States is only approved for management of sepsis [11, 26] . The only US data on PCT-guided care for patients with LRTI comes from the ProREAL study, an observational . Provider response to the procalcitonin (PCT)-guided treatment algorithm. A circle represents an individual PCT value for each intervention study subject. The horizontal bar represents the threshold for PCT values (0.24 ng/mL), which defines levels as either low or high. The algorithm discourages antibiotic use below this threshold and recommends antibiotics for values above this level. Results are segregated by provider response to the algorithm and are designated as \"algorithm followed\" and \"algorithm rejected.\"",

For the 295 patients evaluated in the United States, adherence to the algorithm was 35%, which was significantly lower than the percentage among algorithm-experienced European centers, suggesting that experience increases confidence and compliance with this approach. In contrast, studies examining the benefits of viral testing to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use have largely been observational [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . The only randomized clinical trial to date was performed in children and demonstrated significantly less antibiotic use and diagnostic testing for children whose rapid influenza test results were made available to providers, compared with those whose information was withheld [33] . Although limited by the small sample size, our study suggests that testing for viral pathogens in addition to influenza virus may reduce antibiotic use.",

Adherence to the PCT algorithm was 64%, which was encouraging, given the low US compliance rate in the study by Albrich et al [22, 23] . However, despite relatively good compliance and a population enriched for subjects with a low risk for bacterial complications, we did not see significant differences in antibiotic use between the intervention and nonintervention arms. We suspect that this result was in part due to a significant study effect resulting in decreased antibiotic exposure in nonintervention patients. Supporting this conclusion was the overall decrease in the duration of antibiotic therapy for nonintervention subjects, compared with the duration for similar historical controls. The study effects were likely multifactorial, including the prestudy educational sessions, spillover care resulting from providers caring for patients in both arms, and increased awareness of viral activity in the community. Last, providers were also aware that their behavior was being observed, which may have resulted in a Hawthorne effect [34] .",

            "text": "Our study had a number of limitations. Because the trial was designed as a feasibility pilot with a small sample size, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from subgroup analyses, particularly the additive value of viral testing to PCT-guided therapy. Moreover, the study was not powered to determine noninferiority of PCT-guided care, compared with standard treatment algorithms. However, like the European trials, we did not detect any major safety signals prohibitive to proceeding with larger clinical trials. Second, repeat PCT measurements over several days during hospitalization were not performed and may be of added value to decrease antibiotic use. Additionally, routinely available hospital PCR may have diluted the effects of multiplex viral testing. Last, the use of historical controls to evaluate a study effect cannot address other changes in practice that may have occurred unrelated to the study. Nevertheless, the lessons learned from this study should facilitate the design of larger, definitive US trials. Although our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of performing PCT trials in the United States, a number of factors need consideration. First, hospital stays for nonpneumonic LRTI tend to be brief, and thus the opportunity to intervene is limited. To maximize impact on antibiotic exposure, the intervention should begin early, ideally in the emergency department. Second, algorithm adherence needs to improve, although clinical judgment remains the cornerstone of good medical care, and 100% compliance should not be the goal. Future trials should therefore incorporate strategies to influence physician behavior, such as the use of antibiotic stewardship teams to reinforce PCT algorithm recommendations. Because a study effect appeared to be an important impediment to demonstrating a significant difference in antibiotic exposure or the independent effect of viral testing, future trials may need to use separate but comparable study sites for the intervention and nonintervention groups. Finally, once the safety of PCT-guided care in patients with LRTI at lower risk for bacterial infections has been established, its use should also be explored for subjects with pneumonic disease.",
