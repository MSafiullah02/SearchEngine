No vaccine is effective against HCV. In addition, the severe side effects of the current treatments with pegylated interferon\u2010\u03b1 (peg\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b1) plus ribavirin, including depression, fatigue, flu\u2010like symptoms and haemolytic anaemia, often lead to discontinuation of the treatment, thereby warranting the need to develop novel drugs with higher efficacy and more favourable side effect profiles to treat HCV infection.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus is an enveloped, positive\u2010stranded RNA virus belonging to the Hepacivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family [3]. It has a 9.6\u2010kb genome encoding a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by both the host and virus proteases into at least 10 mature individual proteins: four structural proteins (C, E1, E2 and p7) and six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [4]. Among the latter, NS5A promotes improper upregulation of hepatic nuclear transcription factor\u2010kappaB (NF\u2010\u03baB) and the cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102) signalling pathway, leading to chronic inflammation or proliferation of hepatoma cells [5, 6, 7]. COX\u20102 is an inducible enzyme involved in the production of various prostaglandins (PGs) upon exposure to multiple stimuli such as viral and bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, oncogenes, mitogens and growth factors [8]. However, aberrant upregulation of COX\u20102 expression contributes to the progress of hepatic carcinogenesis because elevated PG concentrations promote cell proliferation, survival and inhibition of the pro\u2010apoptosis pathway, ultimately resulting in tumour formation [8]. Recently, various studies have reported that elevated COX\u20102 protein levels favour increased HCV replication, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated [7, 9, 10]. On the basis of these findings, an attractive means of minimizing the HCV\u2010related liver malignancy is by eliminating the NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010COX\u20102\u2010dependent signalling pathway for simultaneously reducing viral infection and hepatocarcinogenesis.",

SHXT possesses a variety of bioactivities including hypotensive effects [11], anti\u2010inflammatory effects [12, 13], cardiovascular effects [14], gastric protection [15], antioxidant activity [16], neuronal protection [17] and immunomodulatory effects [18]. SHXT has been used in the clinical treatment of human diseases, such as hypertension, gastritis, gastric bleeding and peptic ulcers for several years [19, 20, 21]. Currently, a number of studies have demonstrated that SHXT and its herbal components possessed antihepatocellular carcinoma activity, suggesting that SHXT is a potential \u2018hepatoprotector\u2019 agent [22]. Several marker compounds in SHXT such as baicalin and wogonin possess antiviral activities against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis B virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, HIV\u20101 infection or influenza virus [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. However, to date, the anti\u2010HCV activity of the constituents of SHXT has not been documented. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed its inhibitory effect on HCV replication and the synergistic anti\u2010HCV activity in combination with various inhibitors using a cell\u2010based HCV replicon system. As an extension of chemotherapeutic carcinogenesis, the inhibitory effects of SHXT extracts on the improper induction of NF\u2010\u03baB and COX\u20102 expression caused by HCV replication and aetiologic HCV NS5A protein were evaluated. These findings may contribute to a better treatment regimen for patients with chronic HCV infection.",

As current data were unable to clearly discriminate the individual constituents in SHXT\u2010frC\u2010R, we used the SHXT\u2010frC mixture to investigate the anti\u2010HCV activity in this report. Treatment with an equal ratio of commercially available (+)\u2010catechin served as an internal control in each experiment and thus eliminated the biological interference of (+)\u2010catechin on anti\u2010HCV activity assay. To further confirm the antiviral activity of SHXT\u2010frC, Northern blotting and quantitative RT\u2010PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) were performed with a specific probe and primers corresponding to HCV NS5B, respectively, in which the levels of the cellular gapdh gene served as the loading control. As shown in Fig. 1C (a and b, white bars), a clear dose\u2010dependent decrease in HCV RNA levels occurred upon treatment with SHXT\u2010frC for 3 days compared to the treatment of mock control cells (0.1% DMSO). The calculated 50% effective concentration (EC50), defined as the compound concentration that reduced HCV RNA levels by 50%, was 7.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/mL as measured by RT\u2010qPCR analysis (b). At 20 \u03bcg/mL, more than 90% of HCV replication was decreased, and no toxicity was observed (b, white bars), while HCV RNA levels remained unchanged in the presence of (+)\u2010catechin at 16 \u03bcg/mL (b, black bars). The cytotoxic index of the SHXT\u2010frC was evaluated by MTS, and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), defined as the compound concentration that resulted in 50% cell death, was 589.0 \u00b1 4.2 \u03bcg/mL (c), which yielded a high selectivity index value (SI; CC50/EC50) of 84. Similarly, the anti\u2010HCV activity of SHXT\u2010frC was also observed in HCV JFH\u20101 infectious system [33], with an EC50 value of 12.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 1D, white bars). These data support the conclusion that the SHXT\u2010frC is a promising anti\u2010HCV agent and warrants further study.",

To test whether the HCV\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression is influenced by SHXT\u2010frC, Ava5 cells were transfected with a plasmid (pCOX\u20102\u2010Luc) carrying firefly luciferase, which is driven by the COX\u20102 promoter, for 3 days in the presence of increasing concentrations of SHXT\u2010frC. As shown in Fig. 2A, concentration\u2010dependent reduction in the luminescent signal was observed in SHXT\u2010frC\u2010treated cells when compared with 0.1% DMSO\u2010treated Ava5 cells (white bars) and parental Huh\u20107 cells (the fold of control), while treatment with (+)\u2010catechin had no significant effect on COX\u20102 gene expression (black bars). Subsequently, Western blotting was performed to further confirm the effect of SHXT\u2010frC on the suppression of COX\u20102 expression. Consistent with the results of a promoter\u2010based reporter assay, SHXT\u2010frC reduced the COX\u20102 protein levels in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 2Ba). In contrast, (+)\u2010catechin did not result in a significant reduction in COX\u20102 protein levels (Fig. 2Bb). Additionally, COX\u20102 activity in the presence of the SHXT\u2010frC was quantified using the Biotrak PGE2 enzyme immunoassay, and the results showed that the level of PGE2 decreased in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 2C). NF\u2010\u03baB activation is one of the most ubiquitous mediators of COX\u20102 activation in a viral infection [38]. Therefore, we performed a promoter\u2010based assay to determine whether the suppression of COX\u20102 was related to the modulation of transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB upon SHXT\u2010frC treatment. Ava5 and Huh\u20107 cells were transiently transfected with the cis\u2010reporting plasmid pNF\u2010\u03baB\u2010Luc, following which the transfected cells were incubated with or without SHXT\u2010frC for 3 days.

After 3 days, luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, SHXT\u2010frC markedly inhibited NS5A\u2010induced COX\u20102 promoter activity in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (a, white bars), while (+)\u2010catechin did not inhibit COX\u20102 promoter activity induced by NS5A (black bars). Subsequently, we then extended our study to examine whether the inhibitory effect of NS5A\u2010induced COX\u20102 by SHXT\u2010frC was mediated by NF\u2010\u03baB activation. Plasmid pCMV\u2010NS5A\u2010Myc was cotransfected with NF\u2010\u03baB promoter plasmid (pNF\u2010\u03baB\u2010Luc) into Huh\u20107 cells in the absence and presence of SHXT\u2010frC or (+)\u2010catechin for 3 days, in which transfection of pNF\u2010\u03baB\u2010Luc alone served as basal promoter activity of NF\u2010\u03baB.

In contrast, (+)\u2010catechin did not inhibit the NS5A\u2010stimulated NF\u2010\u03baB promoter activity (black bars). The equal expression of NS5A\u2010Myc in each condition was confirmed by Western blotting analysis using anti\u2010Myc antibody (Fig. 4A,B; b,c). These data showed that SHXT\u2010frC effectively targets the NF\u2010\u03baB and COX\u20102 expression, implying that SHXT\u2010frC has the potential to prevent virus\u2010induced hepatocarcinogensis.",

We further analysed the bioactive constituents in SHXT\u2010frC to find that (+)\u2010catechin, a major component in SHXT\u2010frC, has no significant anti\u2010HCV activity at a concentration of 16.0 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 1Cb), which was consistent with those results recently obtained by Li et al., who demonstrated that a single (+)\u2010catechin or (\u2212)\u2010epicatechin showed negligible inhibitory effect on HCV replication, even at a high concentration of 200 \u03bcm, approximately 59.2 \u03bcg/mL. The formation of dimer in (+)\u2010catechin and (\u2212)\u2010epicatechin, designated procyanidin B1, is a requisite anti\u2010HCV activity [40]. However, this observation is controversial when taken with observations reported by Takeshita et al., [41] who demonstrated that catechin extracted from blueberry leaf suppressed HCV RNA synthesis with an EC50 of 16.18 \u03bcg/mL. These divergent results may be attributable to different geometric isomers of catechin [(+)\u2010catechin and (\u2212)\u2010catechin] isolated in our study and the Takeshita et al. study.",

Recently, downregulation of HCV\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression was considered a molecular mechanism involved in the inhibitory effect of HCV replication by using selective COX\u20102 inhibitors, including acetylsalicylic acid, NS398, COX\u20102 inhibitor III and SC\u2010560 [10, 45, 46]. Whether the anti\u2010HCV activity of SHXT\u2010frC depended on the downregulation of COX\u20102 and NF\u2010\u03baB will be further investigated. Additionally, modulation of the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB and COX\u20102 has been shown to increases the replication of a number of viruses, such as cytomegalovirus [47], herpesvirus [48], RSV [49] and enterovirus 71 [50], although the detailed mechanism is not clearly defined.
