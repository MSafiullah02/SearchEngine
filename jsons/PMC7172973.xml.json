Both are vital for successful response.12 Having a designated space for staff to eat, drink, and relax (even if only for a few minutes) is vital to preparedness. By creating a makeshift breakroom, we further reduce foot traffic while simultaneously promoting staff wellness. Staff ingenuity such as clumping activities and moving IV pumps outside the room helps decrease the risk of exposure. The use of a dedicated person to observe doffing (spotter) is vital; this person not only helps ensure the proper steps are followed in the proper order but also can act as a set of eyes to monitor for accidental exposure risk (eg, the outside of the gown touches the RN's skin).",

This can be operationalized as the number of times any door is opened for passage and thereby increases the risk of contamination. As described earlier, adequate staffing to support a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio decreases the number of times a nurse needs to go in and out of a room. After engineering adjustments, the entire nurses' station ventilation was adjusted to increase positive pressure while each patient room in the ward became negative flow. Designating a break area within the ward decreased the need for staff to leave the ward and further reduced door opening.",

Furthermore, her innovations, in themselves, were not revolutionary: do not put too many people in 1 room, clean and change dressings, circulate fresh air, and so forth. What Nightingale did that was revolutionary was to share her ideas. Basing their work in large part on Nightingale's founding principles, Pope et al13 described that, as nurses, we should become part of a cadre of professionals who are responsible for the dissemination of knowledge. We believe that, if Florence had a Facebook or Twitter account, she would have been posting daily from the Crimean battlefield. During this worldwide event, we share our knowledge in the hopes that this will encourage other nurses to share their tips, their innovations, and their ingenuity.",
