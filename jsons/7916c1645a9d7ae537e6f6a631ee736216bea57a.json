The economic cost of it was estimated at USD 98 billion, while the social costs are still unknown. This study investigated how government formed reactive policies to fight coronavirus across its policy sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents from the PIB. An unsupervised machine-based topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was performed on the text corpus. It was done to extract high probability topics in the policy sectors. The interpretation of the extracted topics was made through a nudge theoretic lens to derive the critical policy heuristics of the government. Results showed that most interventions were targeted to generate endogenous nudge by using external triggers. Notably, the nudges from the Prime Minister of India was critical in creating herd effect on lockdown and social distancing norms across the nation. A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in public spaces; Yoga and Ayurveda for immunity), transport (e.g., old trains converted to isolation wards), micro, small and medium enterprises (e.g., rapid production of PPE and masks), science and technology sector (e.g., diagnostic kits, robots and nanotechnology), home affairs (e.g., surveillance and lockdown), urban (e.g. drones, GIS-tools) and education (e.g., online learning). A conclusion was drawn on leveraging these heuristics are crucial for lockdown easement planning.",

            "text": "India locked down 1.3 billion people on March 25, 2020 , in the wake of novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. The Prime Minister of the country, Mr Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation, appealed to the nation that '\u2026 21 days is critical to breaking the infection cycle\u2026 or else the country and your family could be set back 21 years\u2026' (1). In a sense, the government used the nudge of 'nationalism' as an effective measure to control the disease spread. This nudge had critical public policy implications because it successfully convinced 1.3 billion population to abide by lockdown rules at high economic and social costs. The estimated economic cost of the Phase 1 lockdown of 21 days ( March 25 to April 14, 2020) was estimated to be almost USD 98 billion (2) . While nudging is a designbased approach that has been used in several domains for priming human behaviour, it is often used as the 'best-guesses', to tailor government policies (3) . It is challenging to ascertain the reliability and replicability of similar nudge in producing desired behaviour change. Nevertheless, it is imperative to untangle the nudges produced by the government policies for coping future national challenges like COVID- 19 . In this case, understanding how the central Government of India (GoI) informed policies to handle the ongoing national crisis is crucial for lockdown mitigation planning. It has implications in planning resilience and future-proofing extensive national emergencies.",

This study intends to explore the response of the GoI since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country by collecting open public data published by the Government's nodal agency -Press Information Bureau of India (PIB) (4). The social data-science methodology of topic modelling based on text processing was employed (5) to examine the key areas of interventions that were deliberated by various ministries of GoI during the emergency phase. The topics of interventions which eventually nudged the citizen behaviours were extracted from a textual policy database since the emergence of the first case in the country, on January 30, 2020. The probabilistic distribution curves generated through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was used for texts mining (6) on a text-database, prepared from the press releases, published between January 15, 2020, and April 14, 2020. These topics were then processed to elaborate government nudging for influencing citizen's behaviour in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.",

Although TM entails sophisticated extraction of topics by algorithmically evaluating their 'relevance', integrating this as a guide for future nudging can produce the desired 'priming' and 'selective optimisation'.

The integration of TM for nudge identification from government policy documents defines the novelty of this study. This study will aid policymakers and government agencies in India to plan lockdown easement from a multi-dimensional public policy perspective.

And some general words appear in most of the government media releases like \"name of ministers\", \"secretary\", \"union government\" and courtesy words like \"Shri\", \"honourable\", \"respected\", \"sir\" and \"thank you\". We constructed a list of additional stop words that were colloquial terms in Indian-English and removed them from the text-corpus. This step is usually called lemmatisation (21) . Lemmatisation also involved removal of inflectional ending of words, and converting the grammatical form of a word into the base or dictionary form (known as Lemma) (21) .",

It seeks to improve understanding and management of the 'heuristic' influences on human behaviour which is central to 'changing' people (30) . Epistemologically, Thaler and Sunstein (30) used nudge policies and interventions as an application of a conceptual framework called libertarian paternalism. The authors contend that retaining the freedom to choose is the best safeguard against a misguided policy intervention. The 'nudging' approach is paternalistic in the sense of motivating behaviour change that aligns with the target population's deliberative preferences (29) . Thus, libertarian paternalism relies on the assumption that each human being makes many decisions automatically and almost unthinkingly each day by following some innate rules of thumb (29) . It had been reported in literature that from a policy-instrumentation perspective, nudges constitute a less coercive form of government intervention compared to more traditional policy tools such as regulations and taxations (31) . While policy interventions can provide the right directions, it cannot suggest the promptness of the behaviour change. The behavioural nudge tactics, here, enable solving this last mile problem of policy intervention implementation success through the use of \"soft\"",

Four topics were extracted, where online learning (Topic 1 and Topic 3) and work from home (Topic 4, \u03b2 = 0.040) were the highest frequency words (see Table 4 ). The topic 1 illustrated the policy focus on infrastructure setup and Policy nudges in the power and energy sector were mostly dedicated to collecting funds for PM-CARES (see Fig 3) .

Extensive nudging was done to ensure that the government was actively involved in delivering essential items by engaging with the supply chain of Indian Railways (see Topic 6) .

It is funding start-ups to develop relevant innovations such as rapid testing for the virus (see Table 8 ) Table 9 shows the topic extracted by LDA in the health sector between January to April. The results show that in January, the policy nudges were in evaluating the risk of incoming travellers coming from China and extending surveillance at international airports. High-frequency words associated with such nudges can be seen in Fig 4.

It created a herd effect on food and medicine security amongst the public that in turn prevented from hoarding on to essential goods.

The general policy during this phase was on the containment of the cases. Extensive thermal screening of the passengers was conducted at the airports. During this stage, public policy was geared towards surveillance at the international borders. It remained a significant strategy until the national lockdown from March 24, 2020, until May 2020. Similarly, Fig 1b illustrates the heat-map of the high-frequency words during the analysis period. The darker shades of grey in the heat-map indicate the policy points (or words) that had high frequency in the media briefs of the Government of India through the Press Information Bureau (PIB). The darker shades of grey also illustrate higher co-occurrences of words in the text corpus.

'mask'\u2192 'measure'; the use of masks had been extensively promoted as a COVID-19 control measure in India and currently made compulsory by law.
