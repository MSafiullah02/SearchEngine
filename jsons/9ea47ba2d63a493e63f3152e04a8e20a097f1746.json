The virus rapidly spread around the world and in June 2009 the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century was declared [2] . Today, in the post-pandemic period, the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has adopted the properties of a seasonal influenza virus [3] . Several countries have already experienced seasonal outbreaks during the last few years, but since the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has now become one of the seasonal strains of influenza viruses it has lost public interest [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, at the beginning of 2013, the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus launched a remarkable ''comeback'' in some regions like the Middle East, Northern Africa and some European countries, e.g. Germany. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant laboratory confirmed subtype in Europe in the 2013 winter season [8] .",

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infected individuals, contaminated objects or by inhalation of virus-laden aerosols. The incubation period is 1.5-3 days. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 differs in pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features and virulence from previous seasonal influenza A viruses. In contrast to other influenza viruses, the pdm09 subtype lacks mutations which are responsible for high pathogenicity. Replication of the virus takes longer and the level of pulmonary replication is higher than in other seasonal influenza viruses [9, 10] .",

Contrary to expectations during the pandemic, Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 caused only relatively mild disease in the general population. Main symptoms of infection were fever and cough in around 80% of patients, followed by dyspnea, fatigue and myalgias, headache, sore throat and gastrointestinal symptoms [13] . Hospitalization rates ranged between 7-20% at the beginning of the pandemic [14] . Younger age groups, including patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as CF patients, were particularly affected by the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus during the 2009 pandemic. In seasonal influenza (eg H3N2 and H1N1) hospitalization rates among children and adults aged between 18 and 64 years were lower than in Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Vice versa, among elderly persons hospitalization rates were lower in Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 than in seasonal influenza strains [15] . 90% of all deaths occurred in persons ,65 years and the highest hospital-ization rates were found in children ,5 years of age [16, 17] . Ethnic minorities and children with pre-existing disorders were disproportionately affected [17] . Risk factors for severe course included age ,5 years or $65 years, obesity, underlying neurological diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney or liver disease, immunosuppression and/or pregnancy [18, 19] . In a large observational study in England during the pandemic period, overall childhood mortality rate was 6 per million population. Children with severe pre-existing disorders such as chronic neurological, gastrointestinal or respiratory disease accounted for 64% of deaths [17] .",

Furthermore in a prospective Canadian study, bacterial coinfection was confirmed by positive culture in 259/681 (38%) of adult ICU admissions [21] . The most common pathogens isolated from respiratory cultures in critically ill children with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) (39%), Pseudomonas species (16%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8%), Haemophilus influenzae (7%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (4%) [22] . Thus, secondary bacterial infection is a leading cause of severe course and death in Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 related death was reported in 7% and 5.3% of patients hospitalized with ILI and PCR confirmed infection [18, 19] . Case fatality rate (CFR) of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in the general population was overestimated at the beginning of the pandemic and finally ranged 2.9 to 7-fold lower than in seasonal influenza infections from 1990-1999 [23] . Contrarily to the early expectations, CFR of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was retrospectively calculated only around 0.04% to 0.05% [24, 25] .",

The disease is caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) resulting in a dysfunctional protein of the apical membrane of epithelial cells [28] . This protein serves as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. Lack or dysfunction leads to ineffective chloride secretion and increased absorption of water from the respiratory tract. Consequently, mucociliary clearance is impaired and viscous mucus is present, which in turn favors chronic bacterial colonization of the airways and pulmonary inflammation. Chronic pulmonary disease accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality in CF. Airway obstruction, infection with typical pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and inflammation lead to progressive deterioration of pulmonary function [29] . Cough, increased sputum production and dyspnea are the most prominent signs of pulmonary manifestations of the disease.",

In this study, we aimed at describing the impact of the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic on CF patients based on a retrospective data analysis of the currently available literature.

What recommendations for prevention and treatment of CF patients with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection can be given according to the current knowledge?",

Case reports, non-clinical studies and publications dealing just with H1N1 vaccination or pharmacokinetics of Oseltamivir were excluded. The search yielded four original articles from four different countries, all published in English language. Two surveys had been conducted as multicenter studies. All studies were designed retrospectively and data collection was based on questionnaires as well as web-based in the two multicenter studies. Incidence (i.e. incidence of the illness), symptoms, treatment and clinical course (i.e. hospitalization, ICU treatment, death) of Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection in CF patients were analyzed from 06/2009 to 04/2010. Out of the four studies and their supplements the following data were recorded: name of first author, journal, country and year of publication, period of analysis, number, age and characteristics of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive CF patients (eg Pseudomonas colonization, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1% pred.), vaccination status), symptoms associated with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, treatment and clinical course.

Incidence of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection ranged from 2.3 to 4.4% in these studies. However, Colombo et al. specifically referred to CF patients with ILI and 68/127 (53%) patients were tested positive for Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [41] . This rate is remarkably increased compared to the general population with ILI, where 36% of patients in a pediatric and 34% in an adult emergency room were proven positive during the pandemic [11, 12] . Pecavar et al. used a similar study period and case definition of ILI compared to Colombo's data in italian CF patients [11, 41] . Although local differences, like a higher amount of circulating virus in the Italian centers, is a possible reason for the difference, these data suggest that CF patients may have an increased susceptibility to the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, at least during the pandemic period.

The mean of FEV1% pred., which is a prognostic factor for progression of pulmonary disease, was poor (50 to 70%) in the analyzed studies. On average, patients aged up to 22 years have a higher FEV1% pred. [43] . Consequently, reported CF patients infected by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, often had poor pulmonary conditions. One may conclude that patients in advanced stages of CF suffer the most from increased Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mediated incidence, like it has already been described for viral respiratory infections in CF patients in general [36] . However, it is possible that only centers with severely affected patients reported their cases and thus reporting bias also provides an explanation for the increased incidence.",

Antibiotics were administered in 66-100% of infected CF patients. During former and during the 2009 influenza pandemic, bacterial coinfection caused substantial morbidity and mortality in healthy individuals and in patients with comorbidities [45, 46] . In this context, CF patients, frequently colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogens, seem to be at high risk for pulmonary exacerbation and fatal course from bacterial coinfection during an influenza outbreak. Therefore, adequate initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment, like it was done in the analyzed studies, is important. However, currently there is no consensus of optimal mode of antibiotic therapy (single or combination) as well as its duration in CF patients [47] .",

More than half of all CF patients (57%) showed a moderate or severe course of disease, requiring hospitalization or even ICU treatment ( Figure 2 ). These data are consistent with previous studies, reporting a three-fold increase for ICU admission or fatal course in patients with chronic lung disease (other than asthma) infected by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [18, 19] . Accordingly, CF lung disease, in contrast to asthma, is likely to represent a clinical risk factor for severe disease course in Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [48] . A possible explanation for this might be that CF patients generally do not suffer more often from viral infections than non-CF individuals, but with worse clinical consequences. Thus CF patients with viral respiratory infections are prone to exacerbations and severe course [36, 37, 49, 50] .",

            "text": "A possible explanation is that specific antiviral host defense mechanisms may be compromised by viral respiratory infection. Impairment of antiviral pathways mediated by high-level NO synthesis and IFN/STAT 1 suggests that airway epithelial cells in CF may allow increased viral replication and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines compared to healthy subjects. This results in a higher degree of airway inflammation and severe respiratory symptoms as it was shown for human parainfluenzavirus infection in CF children [51] . In BAL specimens of CF children with rhinovirus infection, a 100 fold higher viral load was detected compared to healthy children. Higher viral load was negatively associated with production of antiviral mediators. Possibly, impaired production of antiviral mediators in CF patients leads to a high viral burden in the lower airways and may particularly occur in the context of CF exacerbations [50] .",

In vitro, RSV serves as a coupling agent between airway epithelial cells and P. aeruginosa and enhances its adherence to these cells. Thereby, RSV facilitates bacterial colonization (eg with P. aeruginosa) [55] . Moreover there is evidence that viral superinfection leads to oxidative stress, followed by dispersal of planktonic bacteria from biofilm matrix. Planktonic bacteria may interact with basolateral receptors in the airway epithelium and stimulate an intense inflammatory response through increased chemokine responses [56] .",

Therefore, infection control in facilities that care for CF patients is of particular importance. The two main pillars of prevention are vaccination and improvement of hygiene measures. Data on effectiveness of the vaccine in CF patients are scarce and specific immune responses to influenza vaccination in CF patients with advanced disease are not known. Nevertheless, vaccination is strongly recommended by health authorities throughout the world. On the one hand, coverage with the monovalent pandemic vaccine in CF patients was reported to be high but differed markedly between countries [57] . On the other hand, the clinical problem is that the overall acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccination particularly in healthcare workers is poor [58, 59] . In the face of future influenza seasons, efforts to increase vaccination rates in healthcare personnel and close contacts are crucial. Thereby, incidence and serious complications in CF patients might be reduced through herd immunity. Particular attention should be paid on the implementation of hygiene measures in public and private life as well as in hospital settings. Information of CF patients on hygiene and infection control measures e.g. in advance to the influenza season should be performed and combined with influenza vaccination. Furthermore, pneumococcal vaccine provides protection for CF patients from secondary bacterial infection due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

First, there is a certain bias and limited comparability of data due to different methods of analysis and retrospective design of the studies. Second, reporting bias has to be considered in all four surveys. Particularly centers that experienced only mild cases were possibly less likely to participate in the study than those who experienced severe cases. Physicians' awareness and reporting behavior may have influenced data collection and was not assessed. Furthermore different local situations and heterogeneity of the CF population (e.g. children or young adults, different stages of disease) bear further bias. Another caveat relates to the symptoms of disease, which were not consistently described. There is also a lack of systematic assessment of disease severity, which may affect comparability of data. Additionally, calculation of the CFR in the CF population analyzed in these four studies certainly bears a higher inaccuracy than calculations in the general population. However, as diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was verified by PCR in all studies, a high reliability of the viral detection data and thus a distinct case definition can be assumed.",

Initial clinical symptoms of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in CF patients were similar to the general population, beside a significantly increased sputum production. Particularly, patients in advanced stages of CF lung disease were prone to severe course of disease (e.g. ICU admission or death). Early administration of antiviral treatment and antibiotic coverage are crucial. Vaccination and infection control measures should be of public interest at the beginning of an influenza season. However, the impact of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 on the CF population in the post-pandemic period remains poorly understood.",
