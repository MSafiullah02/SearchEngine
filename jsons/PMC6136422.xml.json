            "text": "Currently, there is a paucity of information regarding the molecular pathogenesis for many high\u2010consequence pathogens (HCPs) that pose direct threats to public health and security both nationally and internationally. For example, variola virus (VARV), the etiologic agent of smallpox, was responsible for ~ 500 million human fatalities in the 20th century prior to its successful eradication in May 1980 (Mahalingam et al., 2004). Following the cessation of routine vaccinia virus (VACV) vaccination, a significant portion of the global population has been left vulnerable to VARV. This has resulted in significant concerns regarding the potential release of VARV, or another closely related orthopoxvirus, such as monkeypox virus (MPXV), to an increasingly vulnerable population. These fears were realized in the continental US, following the unintentional release of MPXV in 2003 from a shipment of Ghanaian rodents destined for exotic pet trade (Damon, 2011). Concerns have also been raised due to the increasing incidence of MPXV infection within Africa (Rimoin et al., 2010). Hemorrhagic fever viruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV), are also considered global health concerns due to the potential for accidental introduction of these highly lethal viruses from endemic regions or intentional manipulation for bioterrorism purposes. These concerns have been exacerbated by recent reports of a case of Marburg virus (MARV) in a tourist returning from Uganda to the Netherlands (Centers for Disease C & Prevention, 2009; Timen et al., 2009). Moreover, concerns regarding virus spread from predominantly rural to urban areas during recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks have further strengthened concerns that these highly lethal viruses could be unintentionally introduced into densely populated areas (Bhaumik, 2012; Wasswa, 2012). Subsequent investigations have demonstrated that EBOV\u2010infected pigs have the potential to transmit virus under laboratory conditions in an interspecies (nonhuman primates) and intraspecies manner through airborne and contact transmission, respectively (Kobinger et al., 2011; Weingartl et al., 2012). It has been argued that the increasing advances in our understanding of these pathogens, and the disease processes they mediate, may provoke the development of engineered pathogens with enhanced virulence (Petro et al., 2003; Lindler et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The molecular pathogenesis for many high consequence of emerging pathogens remains largely uncharacterized, despite the associated health risks and potential economic or critical infrastructure burdens associated with HCP disease outbreaks (whether intentional or unintentional). Indeed, a large proportion of investigations of HCP pathogenesis have been limited to global surveys of host gene expression or virus life cycle from experimental animal infections or clinical samples from infected patients (Gupta et al., 2001; Geisbert et al., 2003; Rubins et al., 2004; Towner et al., 2004; Esteves et al., 2007; Hartman et al., 2008). For example, EBOV particle attachment and entry into human macrophages resulted in the induction of pro\u2010inflammatory mediators [including interleukin (IL)\u20106, IL\u20108, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1] as demonstrated by microarray analysis (Wahl\u2010Jensen et al., 2011). Kash et al. (2006) have also demonstrated that EBOV infection of human hepatocytes resulted in the suppression of antiviral responses, and Yen et al., (2011)identified discernable differences in the immune responses of nonhuman primates (NHPs) treated with coagulation inhibitors as compared to untreated animals in a lethal EBOV infection model. Connor and colleagues have also demonstrated through transcriptional profiling that Lassa virus infection resulted in the early induction of interferon\u2010responsive and Toll\u2010like receptor\u2010mediated signaling networks in aerosol\u2010exposed NHPs (Malhotra et al., 2013). Further, analyses of host gene expression during MPXV infection by Alkhalil et al. (2010) and Rubins et al. (2011) demonstrated that infection resulted in the global suppression of host gene expression. A more recent comparison of orthopoxvirus modulation of host gene expression programs during the course of in vitro infection was reported by Bourquain and colleagues and demonstrated that ~ 96% of the cellular transcripts assayed were unresponsive to infection with cowpox virus (CPXV), VACV, or MPXV (Bourquain et al., 2013). In addition, the host responses to CPXV, VACV, and MPXV were significantly different, suggesting that viruses from the same family are likely adapted to a particular mechanism of pathogenesis. This limits the ability to infer host responses for virus families from individual viruses. Further, Rubins et al. (2008) also investigated the gene expression programs of both VACV and MPXV providing the first map of pathogen\u2010specific responses during the course of infection for orthopoxviruses.",

            "text": "While such studies of global gene expression have been informative, many questions remain regarding the molecular pathogenesis of HCPs. In particular, there is considerable debate as to whether it is most appropriate to assess biologic responses at the transcriptional, translational, or post\u2010translational levels. Although the proliferation of various high\u2010throughput methodologies has provided platforms for assessing biologic responses at each of these levels, the associated costs and expertise required for such investigations have in many instances limited their application. There has also been an increasing appreciation for that many cellular processes are regulated independently of changes in transcription or translation through post\u2010translational modifications with kinase\u2010mediated protein phosphorylation being the best characterized. Indeed, virtually all signal transduction processes are regulated by kinase\u2010mediated protein phosphorylation independent of biologic complexity (from prokaryotes to eukaryotes) (Hunter, 2000). In support of this, dysregulated kinase activities have been implicated in a growing number of human malignancies with > 250 kinase genes mapping to disease loci (Knuutila et al., 1998). As a testament to the biologic importance of kinases, there have been over 500 kinases identified in the human genome (\u2248 2% of the human genome), and it is estimated that \u2248 30% of the human proteome is modified by kinase\u2010mediated phosphorylation (Hunter, 1995). Individual kinase activities may also be more reliable predictors of functional cellular changes than changes in gene or protein expression considering their central role in such broad cellular processes as growth and development, metabolism, and innate immunity (Arsenault et al., 2011; Kindrachuk & Napper, 2013). Thus, there is increasing interest in characterizing and quantifying the global activation state of host kinases or the kinome. Additionally, the integration of systems biology approaches, including pathway over\u2010representation analysis (ORA), provides enhanced capabilities to identify events (i.e. signaling networks; individual kinases) that are critical to disease progression or resolution.",

            "text": "From the perspective of therapeutic design and development, kinases are logical drug targets considering their regulatory role in cell processes and conserved catalytic cleft (Arsenault et al., 2011). As a testament to this, there are currently 25 kinase inhibitors with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure (encompassing indications that include cancer, Rheumatoid arthritis, myeloid fibrosis and transplant rejection) and a continually increasing number that are entering preclinical trials. In addition, kinases are the most frequently targeted gene class in cancer therapy, second only to the G protein\u2010coupled receptors as therapeutic targets (Cohen, 2002; Hopkins & Groom, 2002). Kinase inhibitors have been employed as treatments for malignancies as diverse as leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (imatinib) (Druker et al., 1996, 2001), diabetic retinopathy (ruboxistaurin) (Danis & Sheetz, 2009), atopic dermatitis (safingol) (Eglen & Reisine, 2009), and cerebral ischemia (fasudil) (Yamashita et al., 2007). There is also an increasing impetus to consider the repurposing of FDA\u2010approved kinase inhibitors for use as anti\u2010infective therapies. As the associated costs of moving a new drug from bench to bedside are estimated at > $1 billion, the use of approved kinase inhibitors in novel applications is enticing. Further, the National Institutes of Health Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has recently adopted a new strategy aimed at repurposing drugs with pre\u2010existing FDA approval for treatment of additional malignancies (Allison, 2012). In support of this, Reeves et al. (2005) have demonstrated that imatinib, an Abl\u2010family kinase inhibitor, promoted survival in VACV\u2010infected mice and reduced viral dissemination by five orders of magnitude. Although imatinib had a negligible effect on VACV yield, the authors demonstrated that the release of enveloped extracellular virus (EEV) was inhibited by drug treatment in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent studies by the authors demonstrated that imatinib provided protection from lethal VACV infection in mice when delivered prophylactically or therapeutically. Further, Reeves et al. (2011) demonstrated a similar inhibitory effect for imatinib against MPXV and VARV EEV release and viral spread providing evidence for a broad antiorthopoxvirus effect of the drug. Napier et al. (2011) have also demonstrated that these anti\u2010infective activities are not limited to orthopoxvirus family members as imatinib reduced bacterial loads and granulomatous lesion numbers when added prophylactically or therapeutically in a mouse model of mycobacterial infection. Interestingly, the authors also demonstrated that coadministration of imatinib with either rifampicin or rifabutin acted synergistically to reduce mycobacterial load in vivo.",

However, this must also be tempered with the appreciation that: (1) kinase inhibitor treatments for HCP infections would likely be short term in nature; and (2) the pathology of various HCP family members has been associated with overactivation of the innate immune system. Thus, kinase inhibitors that both suppress viral replication (directly or indirectly) and reduce the pathological effects associated with overactivation of innate immunity may offer a dual purpose in short term and/or immediate treatment strategies for HCP infections.",

            "text": "The increasing interest in characterizing the global roles for kinases and kinase\u2010mediated signal transduction in human disease has potentiated the development of novel research platforms for these purposes (Jalal et al., 2007). It should also be appreciated that the evolutionary conservation of kinases and their respective substrates provides the opportunity to apply similar methodologies for kinome analysis across animals of multiple animal in vitro and in vivo. Traditional phosphoproteomic technologies have been limited by the confining nature of the technological requirements for such analyses as well as the relative scarcity of phosphorylated proteins within a given protein sample (\u2248 1\u20132% of the total population of an individual protein). In contrast, investigation of the host kinome based on well\u2010defined and conserved enzymatic phosphorylation events seems a logical alternative (Arsenault et al., 2011). Incorporation of high\u2010throughput analyses based on kinase\u2010mediated phosphotransfer events, such as peptide kinome arrays, provides a functional mechanism for characterizing the modulation of host cell signaling networks during disease pathogenesis (Cohen, 2002; Hopkins & Groom, 2002). Kinome arrays utilize the principles of kinase substrate specificity as this is dictated by the residues adjacent (\u00b1 4) to the phosphoacceptor site (Kreegipuu et al., 1998). Indeed, the application of synthetic peptides for kinase analysis is supported by reports that kinases recognize and phosphorylate linear peptide targets with comparable V\nmax and K\nm values as those for the native proteins (Zhu et al., 2000). Thus, the synthesis of short linear peptide sequences followed by their covalent linkage to a solid platform (glass slides) provides an economically viable high\u2010throughput platform for investigating host kinome responses (Kindrachuk & Napper, 2013). Detailed reviews regarding commonly used strategies for peptide synthesis and covalent linkage can be found elsewhere (Houseman et al., 2002; Jalal et al., 2007). As such, peptide arrays comprising of hundreds to thousands of immobilized, specific peptide targets for kinases have been reported. From the perspective of kinase target selection, publically available databases such as PhosphoSite (http://www.phosphosite.org) or Phospho.ELM (http://phospho.elm.eu.org) provide manually curated, literature\u2010based phosphorylation sites for a broad selection of proteins.",

            "text": "For typical kinome array analyses, cellular lysates from comparative samples (infected/stimulated vs. uninfected/unstimulated) are applied to the kinome array followed by phosphotransfer from active kinases in the cell supernatants to their corresponding peptide targets (Fig. 2). Although the use of gamma phosphorous\u201032 (\u03b3\u201032P) for such analyses limited the high\u2010throughput aspect of kinome analysis and increased concerns regarding radioactive waste removal (in particular within high\u2010containment laboratory environments), the incorporation of phospho\u2010specific fluorescent stains, such as the Pro\u2010Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Stain, has removed these constraints. In addition, postimaging extraction of kinome array data was hindered by the lack of software analysis packages suitable for the extraction of kinome array data. To remedy this, Li et al. (2012) developed the Platform for Integrated Intelligent Kinome Analysis (PIIKA) pipeline (http://saphire.usask.ca/saphire/piika/index.html) for kinome array data analysis. Through PIIKA, a relative degree of activity or phosphorylation (fold change) under different experimental conditions is assigned based on a user\u2010selected comparative (disease vs. normal; treated vs. untreated; infected vs. uninfected, etc.). Following data extraction from PIIKA, subsequent analysis of these data sets through pathway ORA databases provides a computational method for dissecting biologic information from the kinome array data by identifying over\u2010represented functional signaling networks or pathways within the kinome data sets. Publically available pathway analysis databases such as InnateDB (http://www.innatedb.com) (Lynn et al., 2008) or the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa & Goto, 2000) provide a mechanism for performing such analyses. Commercially available software, such as the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software suite, provides alternative mechanisms for deriving biologic data from kinome analyses. We recommend reviews by Khatri et al. (2012) and Ramanan et al. (2012) to the reader for more in\u2010depth analyses on the subject.",

Thus, concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of an outbreak of VARV virus in an increasingly vulnerable population. Additionally, the increasing incidence of MPXV (Rimoin et al., 2010) lends further credence to these concerns and highlights the importance for the design and development of novel antiviral therapeutic strategies for orthopoxvirus infections. MPXV is comprised of two distinct clades that are genetically, clinically, and geographically distinct. Central African MPXV has associated case fatality rates of approximately 10% in nonvaccinated individuals, whereas West African MPXV, the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak in the US, has not caused fatalities (Jezek et al., 1988). Animal infection models in multiple animal species have demonstrated similar differences in virulence between viruses of the different MPXV clades (Sbrana et al., 2007; Hutson et al., 2009, 2010; Osorio et al., 2009; Saijo et al., 2009).

Through a combination of kinome analysis, pathway ORA, and molecular biologic techniques, we demonstrated in human monocytes that West African MPXV up\u2010regulated growth factor\u2010 and apoptosis\u2010mediated host cell responses as compared to Congo Basin MPXV. These results were confirmed by fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting analysis as West African MPXV infection resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis in human monocytes as compared to Congo Basin MPXV. We also identified a subset of kinases that were differentially modulated by the two MPXV clades, including Akt and p53. Chemical inhibition of Akt phosphorylation significantly reduced Congo Basin MPXV virus titers, whereas West African MPXV virus yield was not affected. Although West African and Congo Basin MPXV proteins share 99.4 % amino acid sequence similarity, the differences in sequence are localized to proteins associated with modification of host responses (Likos et al., 2005) and are therefore likely responsible for the differences seen in our kinome results.",

In this regard, animal models have been employed extensively for investigations of HCP pathogenesis and as well as for the identification of novel therapeutics and evaluation of their associated efficacies/toxicities. Murine models have been employed extensively for examining HCP pathogenesis due to their relative cost, limited genetic background (and thus increased experimental reproducibility), and the availability of analytical reagents. Recently, Seok et al. (2013) reported that the genomic responses of laboratory mice in acute inflammatory disease models correlated poorly with those of human patients. Although the authors recognized that these prior studies were likely impeded by inadequate study designs and data sets, it is likely that many investigations have also been hindered by an assumed conservation of functional host responses between humans and nonhuman animal species. Moreover, there has been a relative paucity of therapeutic candidates that have translated from animal models into approved use for humans. Hackam & Redelmeier (2006) recently noted that only one\u2010third of these studies translated into randomized clinical trials, and of these, only one\u2010tenth of the therapeutic candidates acquired FDA approval.

Further, in reference to the FDA Animal Rule (Services, U.D.o.H.a.H., F.a.D. Administration, 2002), the incorporation of conserved molecular responses to that of humans for guiding animal model selection would presumably increase confidence in the study of therapeutics for diseases in which human clinical studies are not ethical. Thus, the design of species\u2010specific kinome arrays seems a logical approach in particular for species for which reagent availability is scarce. Here, Napper and colleagues have demonstrated the ability to create species\u2010specific kinome arrays for diverse organisms including humans, cows, and horses (Arsenault et al., 2011; Kindrachuk & Napper, 2013). Although much of the early design of species\u2010specific kinome arrays was guided through manual sequence homology searches using BLAST, improved bioinformatics applications have provided significant improvements in the prediction of phosphorylation sites for nontypical species. In particular, this manual approach to peptide target design was time\u2010consuming, subjective, and limited to homologues of human phosphorylation sites (Trost et al., 2013). Trost et al. (2013) have recently reported the creation of dapple (http://saphire.usask.ca), a software pipeline for the homology\u2010based prediction of phosphorylation sites. dapple provides an automated interface that circumvents the limitations of such manual approaches to peptide target prediction while also providing a mechanism for increasing the accuracy of the predictions and as well the diversity of the species which can be examined (Fig. 3). Through collaboration, our laboratory has designed kinome peptide arrays for multiple animal species of interest in the investigation of high\u2010containment pathogens. The ability to incorporate routine kinome analysis, whether it is from the perspective of the host or pathogen, provides a mechanism for identification of novel biomarkers of disease, characterize molecular pathogenesis, and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention (Fig. 4).",

Within the IRF\u2010Frederick, the strategic mission is to manage, coordinate, and facilitate the research of emerging infectious diseases for the development of vaccines, countermeasures, and the improved medical outcomes of patients. In this regard, kinomics research at the IRF\u2010Frederick will provide researchers with the ability to temporally characterize the functional cellular response of host species to high\u2010consequence pathogens. Further, based on the unique blend of medical imaging capabilities and maximum containment laboratories, the IRF\u2010Frederick provides an unprecedented capability to verify the biologic relevance from such molecular analyses both in vitro and in vivo. The integration of the various medical imaging modalities to evaluate the progression of disease in a single animal with kinome analysis provides an opportunity to verify the biologic relevance of the molecular responses through the course of disease or therapeutic intervention and to facilitate the development of medical countermeasures.",

These concerns are exacerbated by both a knowledge gap regarding HCP molecular pathogenesis and a scarcity of therapeutic options beyond supportive care. This is particularly troubling considering the recent outbreaks of Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus in Uganda and the DRC (Albarino et al., 2013), and Sin Nombre virus in California (Centers for Disease C & Prevention, 2012), and the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (De Groot et al., 2013). Thus, it is inherently important to characterize molecular pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets or strategies for these emerging infectious diseases. Kinome analysis with peptide arrays provides a high\u2010throughput mechanism for investigating HCP pathogenesis (Arsenault et al., 2011). In addition, the introduction of systems approaches to specifically mine large data sets provides the opportunity to gain further biologic perspective from kinome data (Li et al., 2012).",

Kinome analysis satisfies this goal by monitoring the activation state of functional signaling networks. Further, it may also provide opportunity to identify unique molecular signatures or biomarkers in the way of signaling networks or individual kinases that are broadly conserved across various pathogens. This is of particular importance from the perspective of therapeutic treatment strategies, as the identification of conserved host targets modulated by multiple HCPs would provide focused targets for the design and development of broad range antiviral therapeutics.",
