SP-D participates in neutralization and clearance of influenza viruses given its molecular affinity to viral hemagglutinin [7, 8]. SP-D levels correlates with pro-inflammatory immune responses, mainly when alveolar macrophages interact with the trimeric form trough their CD91 receptor, leading the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway to elicit Th1 responses [8]. SP-D production is influenced by diverse lung disorders [9, 10], and its role as a biomarker of lung inflammation has been described [11, 12]. Based on the central role of SP-D in the pulmonary host defense and in the regulation of inflammatory responses and its dysregulation in lung diseases, we hypothesize that circulating levels of SP-D are modified as a result of lung tissue damage in critically ill A/H1N1-infected patients, and that SP-D is a useful biomarker to predict poor outcomes in ARDS patients with A/H1N1 infection.",

The most striking findings were that the patients with fatal outcome displayed a marked increase in the circulating levels of SP-D. After adjustment by age, gender, comorbidities, and APACHE II score, we found that a serum SP-D concentration >250 ng/mL could predict an increased risk of death at 28 days in patients with pneumonia associated to the A/H1N1 virus infection.",

Serum SP-D has been proposed as a biomarker for acute and chronic respiratory diseases including COPD and IPF in diverse clinical studies [16\u201318]. These studies support the hypothesis of the potential deleterious effect of the overproduction of SP-D which was directly associated with worse clinical outcomes in lung diseases. Nishida and coworkers [19] reported a non-significant correlation of SP-D and KL-6/MUC1 mucin levels with the clinical progression or poorer outcomes in pediatric A/H1N1 patients. These differences might be explained because pediatric patients had a milder disease and did not require mechanical ventilation, whereas more than 80 % of our patients required mechanical ventilation at the ICU. Interestingly, other studies have described that low levels of SP-D expression in lungs are associated with fatal influenza by A/H1N1 strain [20]. Our findings indicate that serum SP-D levels might be useful to estimate the risk of poorer outcomes in critical patients with severe lung disease associated to A/H1N1.",

This protein often translocates to the systemic circulation in clinical conditions in which lung permeability is increased. Different studies have demonstrated that SP-A and SP-D are important biomarkers of IPF where high levels of these surfactant proteins are predictors of mortality [21]. In addition, evidence in large cohorts also supports its importance as a prognostic marker of clinical exacerbations and in COPD progression [18]. Recent reports suggest that the analysis of circulating levels of SP-D is useful as a diagnostic tool in severe sepsis patients with ARDS [22] and to evaluate the progression of lung injury in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation in whom circulating levels of this protein positively correlates with the lung injury score as a parameter to measure the pathophysiological features of ARDS [23] In this scenario, clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the increased plasma SP-D levels could reflect acute alveolar damage and type II cell hyperplasia [24, 25]. Thus, SP-D level appears to be a reliable indicator of alterations in alveolar epithelial permeability because is more hydrophilic than other surfactant proteins such as SP-A that possibly results in a higher capacity to enter to the circulation.",

In our study, a dose of 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone was administered to ICU admitted patients during the mechanical ventilation during the outbreak in April 2009. As we mentioned in the results section, a mortality rate of 32.4 % was observed in our patients after 28 days, whereas 54 % of mortality was observed in A/H1N1 patients that received similar doses of steroids after 90 days of follow-up [30].
