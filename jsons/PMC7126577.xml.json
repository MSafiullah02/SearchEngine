            "text": "Protein synthesis promoter sequences play an important role in the function regulation of several important mycobacterial pathogens (Levine and Tjian, 2003; Wyrick and Young, 2002). In this sense, the prediction of the mycobacterial promoter sequences (Mps) could be interesting for the future discovery of new anti-mycobacterial drug targets or for the study of protein metabolism. Mycobacteria have a low transcription rate and a low RNA content per DNA unit. Thus, the transcription and translation signals in Mycobacteria may be different from those in other bacteria such as Esccherichia coli. The large variations among the characterized mycobacterial promoters suggest that the consensus sequences are not representative of these promoters. Consequently, a number of conflicting opinions regarding the presence and characteristics of consensus promoter sequences in the Mycobacteria have been presented in the literature (Mulder et al., 1997). Therefore, understanding the factors responsible for the low level of transcription and the possible mechanisms of regulation of gene expression in Mycobacteria, involves the examination of the mycobacterial promoter structure and the promoter transcription machinery, including chemical information about the involved RNA molecules (Arnvig et al., 2005; Harshey and Ramakrishnan, 1977). Efforts have been made to develop statistical algorithms for the sequence analysis and motif prediction by searching for homologous regions or by comparing the sequence information with a consensus sequence (O\u2019Neill and Chiafari, 1989). Wide variations existing within individual promoter sequences are primarily responsible for the unsatisfactory results yielded by the promoter-site-searching algorithms that in essence perform statistical analysis (Mulligan and McClure, 1986; Mulligan et al., 1984). Therefore, it can be inferred that the recognition of Mps requires a powerful technique capable of unravelling those hidden patterns in the promoter regions, which are difficult to identify directly by sequence alignment.",

            "text": "The bioinformatics methods, based on sequence alignment, may fail in general in cases of low sequence homology between the database query and the template sequences. The lack of function annotation (defined biological function) of the sequences used as template for function prediction constitutes another weakness of the alignment approaches (Dobson and Doig, 2005; Dobson et al., 2004, Dobson et al., 2005). In addition, Chou demonstrated that the 3D structures developed, based on homology modelling are very sensitive to the sequence alignment of the query protein with the structure-known protein (Chou, 2004). A group of researchers shows the growing importance of machine learning methods for predicting protein functional class, independently of sequence similarity (Han et al., 2006). These methods often use the input the 1D sequence numerical parameters, specifically defined to seek sequence\u2013function relationships. For instance, the so-called pseudo amino acid composition approach (Chou, 2001a, Chou, 2005), based on 1D sequence coupling numbers, has been widely used to predict subcellular localization, enzyme family class, structural class, as well as other attributes of proteins based on their sequence similarity (Caballero et al., 2006; Chou and Shen, 2006; Du et al., 2008). Alternatively, the molecular indices that are classically used for small molecules (Aguero-Chapin et al., 2006; Liao and Wang, 2004a, Liao and Wang, 2004b, Liao and Wang, 2004c; Liao and Ding, 2005; Liao et al., 2005, Liao et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2002; Nandy, 1994, Nandy, 1996; Nandy and Basak, 2000; Randic and Vracko, 2000; Randic and Balaban, 2003; Randic and Zupan, 2004; Randic et al., 2000; Song and Tang, 2005; Woodcock et al., 1992; Zupan and Randic, 2005) have been adapted to describe the protein sequences. On the other hand, many authors have introduced 2D or higher dimension representations of sequences prior to the calculation of numerical parameters. This is an important step in order to uncover useful higher-order information not encoded by 1D sequence parameters (Randic, 2004). An example of the 2D representations is the graphs used for proteins and DNA sequences. For instance, the spectral-like and zigzag representations have been used in order to suggest an algorithm to enclose long strings of building blocks (like four DNA bases, 20 natural amino acids, or all 64 possible base triplets) (Aguero-Chapin et al., 2006). The use of the graphic approaches to study biological systems can provide useful insights, as indicated by many previous studies on a series of important biological topics, such as enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Andraos, 2008; Chou, 1981, Chou, 1989; Chou and Forsen, 1980; Chou and Liu, 1981; Chou et al., 1979; Cornish-Bowden, 1979; King and Altman, 1956; Kuzmic et al., 1992; Myers and Palmer, 1985; Zhou and Deng, 1984), protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990), inhibition kinetics of processive nucleic acid polymerases and nucleases (Althaus et al., 1993a, Althaus et al., 1993b, Althaus et al., 1993c; Chou et al., 1994), analysis of codon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1993, Zhang and Chou, 1994), analysis of DNA sequence (Qi et al., 2007). Moreover, graphical methods have been introduced for the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2006c, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2007b; Prado-Prado et al., 2008) as well as used to deal with complicated network systems (Diao et al., 2007; Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2007a., Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2008). Recently, the \u201ccellular automaton image\u201d (Wolfram, 1984, Wolfram, 2002) has also been applied to study hepatitis B viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a), HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b), and visual analysis of SARS-CoV (Gao et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005), as well as to represent complicated biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a) and help to identify protein attributes (Xiao and Chou, 2007; Xiao et al., 2006b).",

            "text": "In this work, we are proposing a comparative study of the Mycobacterial DNA promoter prediction using pseudo-folding lattice network (LN) and star-graph (SG) topological indices. The first group of indices contains the mean stochastic electrostatic potential (LN\n\u03bek), Markov spectral moments (LN\n\u03c0k) and Markov entropies (LN\n\u03b8k) of a Markov model (MM) associated to a 2D network that numerically characterize DNA sequences and build a QSAR model to predict Mps. The lattice-like representations (also called maps or graphs) for Mps and control group sequences (Cgs) were derived (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2003a, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2006a, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2005c; Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz, 2007d). The \u03bek, \u03c0k and \u03b8k values of several types of graphs/networks have been the base for different QSAR studies of DNA/RNA and protein sequences (Du et al., 2007a, Du et al., 2007b; Garcia-Garcia et al., 2004; Marrero-Ponce et al., 2004a, Marrero-Ponce et al., 2004b, Marrero-Ponce et al., 2005b; Meneses-Marcel et al., 2005; Santana et al., 2006). The second group of TIs is derived from the SG representations (Harary, 1969). We subsequently developed a classifier to connect Mps information (represented by the \u03bek, \u03c0k, \u03b8k and SG TIs values) with the prediction of Cgs as Mps. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was selected as a simple but powerful technique (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2006b; Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz, 2003a).",

            "text": "The first MM, also called MARCH-INSIDE, was used to codify the information of 135 Mps (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2005a, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2006a, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2007d) and 511 random Cgs (see Table S.1 in the Supplementary material). Our methodology considers as states of the Markov Chain (MC) any atom, nucleotide or amino acid depending on the class of molecule to be described (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2005e, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2003c). Therefore, MM deals with the calculation of the probabilities (k\npij) where the charge distribution of nucleotide moves from any nucleotide in the vicinity i at time t\n0 to another nucleotide j along the protein backbone in discrete time periods, until a stationary state is achieved (Yuan, 1999). As seen from the discussion above, we selected LN\n\u03bek\n,\nLN\n\u03c0k and LN\n\u03b8k based on the utility of non-stochastic (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz and Uriarte, 2005; Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2005d; Ramos de Armas et al., 2004) and stochastic parameters (Randic and Vracko, 2000). Many researchers have demonstrated the possibility of predicting RNA from sequences (Aguero-Chapin et al., 2006) and we used 2D graphs to encode information about Mps sequences (Estrada, 2000, Estrada, 2002; Estrada and Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz, 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2005b; Gonz\u00e1lez and Moldes del Carmen Teran, 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005, Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2006; Vilar et al., 2005, Vilar et al., 2006). This RNA 2D graphical representation is similar to those previously reported for DNA (Jacchieri, 2000; Nandy, 1994, Nandy, 1996) using four different nucleotides. The construction of the 2D lattice graph corresponding to the Mps of the gene Alpha in Mycobacterum bovis (BCG) is shown in Table 1\nand Fig. 1\n. Each nucleotide in the sequence is placed in a Cartesian 2D space starting with the first monomer at the (0, 0) coordinates. The coordinates of the successive nucleotide are calculated according to with the following rules:(a)Increase by +1 the abscissa axis coordinate for thymine (rightwards-step) or(b)Decrease by \u20131 the abscissa axis coordinate for cytosine (leftwards-step) or(c)Increase by +1 the ordinate axis coordinate for adenine (upwards-step) or(d)Decrease by \u20131 the ordinate axis coordinate for guanine (downwards-step).\n",

Note that the number of nodes (n) in the graph is equal to the number of rows and columns in 1\n\u03a0 but it may be equal or even smaller than the number of DNA bases in the sequence. It then becomes straightforward to calculate different types of invariant parameters for 1\n\u03a0 in order to numerically characterize the DNA sequence. In this work we calculated the following invariants:(3)LN\u03c0k=\u2211i=jnkpij\n(4)LN\u03bek=\u2211i=jnkpj\u00b7\u03d5j\n(5)LN\u03b8k=-\u2211i=jnkpj\u00b7log(kpj)where LN\n\u03c0k are the Markov spectral moments and indicate that we sum all the values in the main diagonal of the matrices LN\n\u03c0k=tr(k\n\u03a0)=tr[(1\n\u03a0)k] (tr is the trace operator), LN\n\u03bek are the mean values of electrostatic potentials and LN\n\u03b8k are the Markov entropies (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2007e).

            "text": "Each DNA sequence is a real network where the nucleotides are the vertices/nodes, connected in a specific sequence by the phosphodiester bonds. SG is an abstract representation of the real network that has a dummy non-nucleotide centre and a number of \u201crays\u201d equal with the nucleotide types. In the case of DNA, we can consider two codifications: the nucleotide code (as in the case of the amino acid protein sequences) and the DNA codons (the final incomplete codons are ignored). In the first codification, there are only four branches (\u201crays\u201d) of the star corresponding to the four types of nucleotides: adenosine (a), thymidine (t), cytidine (c) and guanosine (g). Using the codons, the DNA sequences are virtually translated into amino acid sequences that generate 21 branches, 20 standard amino acids and an extra X non-amino acid corresponding to the STOP DNA codons (Griffiths et al., 1999). Even if the promoters are not naturally translated in proteins, the second codification is useful for a comparison with the protein SG calculations. The same DNA/protein can be represented by different forms associated to distinct distance matrices (Randic et al., 2007). Standard SG were constructed for each DNA promoter: each nucleotide/vertex holds the position in the original sequence and the branches are labelled by the standard letters of the nucleotides (a, t, c and g). If the initial connectivity in the DNA sequence is included, the graph is embedded. In order to qualitatively evaluate the graphs, it is necessary to transform the graphical representation into correspondent connectivity matrix, distance matrix and degree matrix. In the case of embedded graph, the matrices of the connectivity in the sequence and in the SG are combined. These matrices and the normalized ones are the base of the calculation of the topological indices.",

In order to decide whether a DNA sequence is classified as a mycobacterial promoter (Prom) or not (nProm), we added an extra dummy variable named Prom/nProm (binary values of 1/\u22121 for LN and 1/0 for SG) and a cross-validation variable (CV). The best cross-validation methods in practice are the independent dataset test, the subsampling test and the jackknife test (Chou and Zhang, 1995). The jackknife test has been increasingly used by investigators to examine the accuracy of various predictors (Chen and Li, 2007; Chou and Shen, 2007a, Chou and Shen, 2008; Diao et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2007; Lin, 2008; Xiao and Chou, 2007). In the actual work, the independent data test is used by splitting the data at random in a training series (train, 75%) used for model construction and a prediction one (val, 25%) for model validation (the CV column is filled by repeating 3 train and 1 val). All the variables included in the models were standardized in order to bring them onto the same scale. Subsequently, standardized linear discriminant equations that allow comparison of their coefficients were obtained (Chiti et al., 2003; Pawar et al., 2005).",

This discriminant function misclassified only 36 cases out of 511 Cgs used, reaching a high level of accuracy (90.87%). More specifically, the model classified correctly 112/135 (82.9%) of Mps and 475/511 (92.9%) of the control group. Conversely, the remaining four descriptors LN\n\u03be\n0,\nLN\n\u03be\n2,\nLN\n\u03be\n3 and LN\n\u03be\n4 do not have a significant relationship with the Mps characteristic. The use of only six molecular descriptors to model a data set of 585 sequences prevents us by large from chance correlation. In physical terms, the above results confirm other studies about the relationship between the electrostatic potential of the DNA molecule and its biological activity. However, in this case, not all the electrostatic interactions affect the activity in the same way. Finally, long-term electrostatic interaction potentials (LN\n\u03be\n0,\nLN\n\u03be\n2,\nLN\n\u03be\n3 and LN\n\u03be\n4) do not correlate with the Mps activity.

Even if the accuracy of the simple nucleotide sequences are up to 81.58% (pool), the selectivity and the specificity have values lower than 70%.

These models were based on the 2S\n\u03b8k (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2007c), 2S\n\u03c0k (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2005a) and 2S\n\u03bek (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2006a) values for the 1\n\u03a0(2S) matrix associated to RNA 2S folding representations. In Table 3 we illustrate that the best values of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.60%, 93.30% and 100% were found for 2S\n\u03b8\n0. This TI is present in the QSAR equations for DNA LN/SG and RNA 2S folding representations. All these observations pointed out the importance of the spectral moments, entropies and in the stochastic electrostatic potentials in the DNA/RNA QSAR models. In general, the results for RNA 2S folding representation are better, but they require additional calculations for the optimization of RNA 2S. Therefore, several RNA 2S are possible for the same DNA sequence (theoretically because the promoters have no correspondent RNA) by introducing an indeterminacy in the final model prediction. In Fig. 3\nwe depict a possible 2S for the RNA sequence corresponding to the DNA sequences used in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 (dG is the free energy). This RNA 2S was obtained with the online DINAMelt server (Markham and Zuker, 2005). The SG TIs that show to not be important for the DNA/RNA models (H, W, S, J) can successfully describe protein QSAR models (Munteanu et al., 2008b). This work pointed out the conclusion that the models based on SG, LN, as well as 2S, which are linear and have few variables, can be compared very favourably in terms of complexity with other models previously reported by Kalate et al. (2003). These authors used a non-linear artificial neural network and a large parameter space.",
