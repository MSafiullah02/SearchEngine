This virus infects the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia in human, seems that the symptoms are milder than SARS and MERS [1] . As off now not much information about the mortality, pathobiology and cellular responses about this disease is known, a probable course of events can be postulated based on past studies with SARS-CoV. Based on the cells that are likely infected, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-2 infection can be roughly divided into three stages; I. Asymptomatic phase with or without detectable virus, II. Non-severe symptomatic with upper airway and conducting airway response and III. Hypoxia, ground glass infiltrates, and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high viral load that correspond to different clinical stages of the disease (Fig 1) [2] . Coronaviruses genome encodes four major proteins spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). The S protein helps viral entry in to target cell of the body. Research has shown that about 75 percent of the COVID-19 S genome is the same as the SARS-CoV genome. However, the amino acid residues needed for receptor binding are the same between these two viruses. This also suggests that the entry receptor, ACE-2, used by SARS-CoV is the same for SARS-CoV-2 as well [3] .",

One of the main mechanisms for ARDS is the cytokine storm, the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune effector cells in SARS-CoV infection [5] . Significantly high blood levels of cytokines and chemokines were also noted in patients with COVID-19 infection that included   IL1-\u03b2, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF2, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, PDGFB, TNF\u03b1, and VEGFA. Some of the severe cases that were admitted to the intensive care unit showed high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1\u03b1, and TNF\u03b1 that are reasoned to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f promote disease severity [6] . The cytokine storm will trigger a violent attack by the immune system to the body, cause ARDS and multiple organ failure, and finally lead to death in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, just like what occurs in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [5] . Patients infected with COVID-19 showed higher leukocyte numbers, abnormal respiratory findings, and increased levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines. The main pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection as a respiratory system targeting virus was severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, combined with the incidence of ground-glass opacities, and acute cardiac injury [4] .",

Moreover, cytokine storm damages lungs and multiple organs of the human body like heart, kidney and liver and eventually leading to multiple organ functions exhaustion [8, 9] .

Since lymphocytopenia is often seen in severe COVID-19 patients, the CRS caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has to be mediated by leukocytes other than T cells, as in patients receiving CAR-T therapy; a high WBC-count is common, suggesting it, in association with lymphocytopenia, as a differential diagnostic criterion for COVID-19 [10] . One caveat is that MSCs need to be activated by IFN\u03b3 to exert their antiinflammatory effects, which may be absent in severely affected patients as T cells are not well activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. To enhance effectiveness, one could consider employing the \"licensing-approach\": pretreat MSCs with IFN\u03b3 with/without TNF or IL-1 [2] . Such cytokine-licensed MSCs could be more effective in the suppression of hyperactive immune response and promotion of tissue repair, as licensed-MSCs are effective in LPS-induced acute lung damage [11] . Lung damage is a major hurdle to recovery in those severe patients. Through producing various growth factors, MSCs may help repair of the damaged lung tissue. It is important to mention that various studies have shown that in animal models with bleomycin-induced lung injury, vitamin B3 (niacin or nicotinamide) is highly effective in preventing lung tissue damage [12] .

The chemical agents previously used to treat SARS and MERS used as potential candidates to treat COVID-19. The number of drugs and combinational therapies were identified by using previously approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, targeting viral protease, regulating immunity, inhibiting the inflammatory cytokine surge, improving pulmonary function and reducing lung viral loads, as an inhibitor of the host cell serine protease and angiotensin receptor blockers, lower the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (Table 1) . Also, the treatments of COVID-19 cytokine storm primarily focus on the anti-shock therapy These include drugs targeting interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-18, and interferon-gamma [29] . While randomized trials will be needed to confirm which, if any, of these therapeutics will effectively treat Covid-19-infected patients with cytokine storm syndrome, IL-6 blockade has recently been reported to be in use in China with successful outcomes in some individuals receiving this as part of their treatment [10] .",

            "text": "Interferons as a potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19However, new interventions will most likely require a long time to develop a COVID-2019 approved drug. Thus, in light of the dire need and urgency to identify the treatment and control of COVID-2019, a remodeling of the use of IFNs has been identified as a possible option in coronavirus control, based on the therapeutic details and recent infections precipitated by the human coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2, MERS and SARS. The potential drug options for SARS-CoV-2 infection include the use of enzyme inhibitors, nucleosides, host-targeted agents, convalescent plasma and IFNs[13,14]. In fact, the IFNs are low molecular weight proteins produced by infected cells after the pathogenic viral effect, constitute the first line of defense against infections[15]. The expression of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are induced by IFN, both in the infected and neighboring cells. These facilitate the establishment of the antiviral state, thus averting and limiting the viral replication(Fig 3)[16,17]. The IFNs enhance the immune system in several ways, exhibiting various biological functions including antiviral, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory and developmental activities[15]. The IFNs employed therapeutically are manufactured using recombinant DNAtechnology and are administered as drugs in the treatment of treatment of viral infections. Some clinically approved IFNs widely used as antiviral agents today are as listed: IFN \u03b1-2a (Roferon), IFN \u03b1-2b (Intron A), IFN \u03b1-n1 (Wellferon), IFN \u03b1-n3 (Alferon), IFN \u03b1 -con 1 (Infergen), IFN \u03b2-1a (Rebif), IFN \u03b2-1b (Betaferon), IFN \u03b2 -1a recent study on MERS-CoV, the combination of remdesivir and IFN b revealed superior antiviral activity compared to the effect of lopinavir and ritonavir in vitro [20]. Research using ribavirin and IFN alpha-2a showed that the MERS-CoV infection treated with oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated IFN alpha-2a significantly improved the patients' chances of survival, if adequate monitoring and assessment can be ensured [21]. The remdesivir and IFN beta-1b, which is generally used to treat multiple sclerosis, may prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19, according to one review published in Nature Reviews in Drug Discovery [14]. Based on pathologic features and genetic homology in SARS it was predicted that a cytokine storm also prevails in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection causing COVID-19. The blood sample of COVID-19 patients there was a marked increase in interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) compared to that of SARS patients. The placebo-controlled trial showed that the combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection [4]. The recombinant human IFN alfa-2B effectively counter the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, as IFN stimulate the genes that produce viral RNA enzymes which are responsible for destruction of viral RNA, proven that SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus. Therefore, treatment with interferon seems logical to combat COVID-19 [22]. Earlier studies showed that coronaviruses including MERS, SARS, human coronavirus 229E, and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are susceptible to IFNs [17,23]. Coronavirus inhibition with IFN J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (type I and type III) has clearly evinced a positive impact against the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection using viral cell culture, in animal experiments, and possibly also in human patients [24,25]. Effective results were also reported in patients with MERS after treating them with a combination of ritonavir (2) + IFN \u03b12a or IFN \u03b1-2b, which resulted in a significantly improved survival rate after 14 days of treatment. The retrospective research study revealed that the combination of ritonavir (2) + IFN \u03b2-1a had no significant effect on clinical outcome in patients infected with MERS, but the combination of ribavirin (1), ritonavir (2) + IFN \u03b1-2a inhibited and stopped the viremia within 48 h of treatment in an infected patient [13]. In recent reviews on therapeutic options and drug discovery targeting coronaviruses provided details on use of recombinant IFNs (IFN -\u03b1, IFN -\u03b2 and exogenous IFNs) in the treatment of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In fact, they showed the IFN response inhibiting the protein synthesis and replication of the virus [25,26]. The study in Lancet on the IFN \u03b1 and \u03b3, alone or in combination, showed them to have partial efficacy against the animal coronaviruses, as well as to inhibit the SARS-CoV replication in vitro. The IFN \u03b2 had the highest potency, demonstrating prophylactic protection and antiviral potential post infection [27]. The evidence indicates the that the IFNs, alone or in combination with clinically approved antiviral drugs are effective against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, for use in the possible control of COVID-2. The research data discussed herein demonstrated that the IFNs can inhibit the coronaviral replication in vitro, providing prophylactic protection and antiviral potential post infection. Thus, the IFNs from patients who J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f recovered from viral infections can be used as a drug of choice, alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs in the treatment and control of the SARS-CoV-2, without any significant, severe adverse effects on human health. Therefore, it might be worthwhile to test the safety and efficacy of human and recombinant IFNs against the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs.",
