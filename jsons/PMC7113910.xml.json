            "text": "Vaccination is the best and most widely used approach to control many infectious diseases (Perdue et al. 2011). In the early 20th century, vaccines were mostly produced in animal tissues, such as nervous tissues extracted from rabbits or goats, or obtained from blood serums of infected animals (Aubrit et al. 2015). Cell-based vaccine manufacturing, which uses cultured cells of mammalian origin as the host to produce viruses, is a highly flexible approach for viral vaccine production (Montomoli et al. 2012), and has obtained increasing acceptance from regulatory agencies and led to major advances in viral vaccine development. During cell-based vaccine manufacturing, candidate vaccine viruses are grown in mammalian tissue culture of cells with a finite lifespan followed by virus extraction from cells in the liquid culture, purification, and test or modification for specific vaccine production (Vlecken et al. 2013) (Figure 1). Among the four major types of vaccines, i.e. live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit/recombinant/polysaccharide/conjugate vaccines, toxoid vaccines, the first three types are suitable to be manufactured using the cell-based approach. Several animal cells have been used for vaccine production for years, such as African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells that were used to produce vaccines against polio and rabies, Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that were employed to manufacture influenza vaccines, and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) that were used to produce vaccines against measles, mumps, rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (Genzel 2015). As one successful example, IMOVAX\u00ae Polio is a sterile suspension of types 1\u20133 of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine and prepared from poliovirus cultured in Vero cells, which has been widely used to prevent poliomyelitis for both primary immunization and boosters through stimulating antibody production in the body. Health intervention using polio vaccine was proved to be cost-effective in the United States (Thompson and Tebbens 2006), Kano and Nigeria (Qadar 2014). Besides cost-effectiveness, the use of cell lines in vaccine production is advantageous in its fast speed and stable vaccine qualities produced. Additionally, cell-based approaches allow for multiple viral vaccines being produced in the same production platforms in a more sterile environment (Audsley and Tannock 2008; Perdue et al. 2011). However, cell-based vaccines require adaptation of the vaccine strains to the new cells (Genzel 2015). For instance, selection pressure was used to adapt MDCK cells to grow in suspension to produce influenza viruses, and the generated MDCK suspension cells were used by Novartis Vaccines to produce the first licenced cell-based influenza vaccine (Gregersen et al. 2011). This adaption sometimes proves to be a difficult task with variable outcomes, resulting in the limited established cell lines for vaccine production despite the intense efforts on novel cell line design for vaccine production (Genzel 2015). Over the past few years, enhancing virus replication in hosts with a goal of reducing vaccine manufacturing costs has been attempted. For example, van der Sanden et al. found that knocking down multiple genes, alone or in pairwise combination, increased viral titres more than 20-fold and over 50-fold, respectively, in poliovirus (van der Sanden et al. 2016). On the other hand, vaccines against different viruses need to be produced using different cell lines, due to the limited tropism of the viruses. This specificity is one of the reasons why the technical cost of the development of a novel cell line for vaccine production remains high. Further, some viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) impose great challenges to human health but still lack effective vaccines available on the market (Morello et al. 2007; Sokal et al. 2007), and viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) are difficult to culture by nature that needs a robust culture model to be established (Zeisel et al. 2015). Thus, there is an urgent need to break the specificity between host and viruses with the potential of constructing a cell line that can be infected by a broad range of viruses.",

            "text": "A few cell lines have already been used for the production of multiple viruses. For example, Vero cells were shown to be highly susceptible to infection with a multitude of different viruses and have been used to produce vaccines against many viral diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis, dengue fever, Ross River disease, chikungunya, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), smallpox and influenza (Barrett et al. 2009). Many factors are known to affect susceptibility of the cells to viral invasion. For example, host antiviral restriction factors induce cellular resistance against a number of viral pathogens (Kluge et al. 2015), and capsid proteins of small non-enveloped DNA viruses play an important role in intracellular membrane perturbation in the early stages of viral infection (Bilkova et al. 2014). Therefore, identifying the key determinants influencing the susceptibility of cells to different viruses, as classified by the Baltimore system, is of the utmost importance. Baltimore classification is a virus classification system that categorizes viruses into families depending on their type of genome and method of replication. Specifically, this system groups viruses into seven classes: double-stranded DNA viruses (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA virus (ssDNA), double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA), positive single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA), negative single-stranded RNA viruses (\u2212ssRNA), positive single-stranded retro RNA viruses (ssRNA-RT) and double-stranded DNA retro viruses (dsDNA-RT) (Figure 2).",

We aimed to identify the minimally required receptor panel for the possibility of constructing cells that can be infected by a broad range of viruses through categorizing virus entry mechanisms and summarizing receptors mediating the entry process according to Baltimore subtyping, and used typical or well-known example viruses to illustrate each summarized entry pathway. We did not differentiate animal or human viruses in this review as it is common to use animal cells for human vaccine production such as the use of MDCK cells for influenza vaccine production, and the use of chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs) for producing vaccines against measles, mumps, rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (Genzel 2015); and the establishment of cell lines feasible for multiple virus production is not limited to human vaccines but also applies to animal vaccines. This study seeks to further our understanding of the mechanisms behind the virus\u2013host interactions, and will arm researchers with the molecular tools for establishing a potentially omnipotent cell line with a broad host tropism or permissivity. This cell line will help us develop a cost- and time-effective vaccine manufacturing platform.",

As endocytosis is prevalent among various types of viruses, fusion and direct penetration are specific to enveloped (possessing an enclosing envelope) and naked (consisting only of a nucleocapsid) viruses, respectively. Viral entry pathways or mechanisms can be cell-type specific, which are primarily determined by host receptors (Karasneh and Shukla 2011).

            "text": "There are two types of cellular endocytosis: phagocytosis and pinocytosis (Lakadamyali et al. 2004). While phagocytosis is typically employed for large particles and bacteria digestion, pinocytosis is responsible for cellular intake of fluids, macromolecules and small pathogens (Lakadamyali et al. 2004). Viruses largely utilize pinocytosis to assist endocytosis-mediated cell entry, which could be classified into three subtypes: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and non-clathrin non-caveolin-mediated endocytosis, according to the vesicles used (Mercer et al. 2010). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is one of the best characterized types of endocytosis for virus entry. During this pathway, ligands enter cells via clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), these pits are internalized to form clathrin-coated vesicles followed by uncoating and subsequent delivery to the early endosomes where they are exposed to an acidic environment (Johnson and Vogt 2010). Internalized cargoes and membrane proteins are typically progressed to the late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation (Vale-Costa and Amorim 2016). In the latter case, the luminal pH is rapidly reduced from 6.5 to 5.5 (Zhu 2014). Caveolin-mediated endocytosis occurs via caveolae, caveolin-associated membrane invaginations, which are pinched off to form endocytic vesicles followed by fusion with caveolin-containing membrane compartments (caveosomes) (Lakadamyali et al. 2004). This process may or may not involve the recognition of host receptors, but depends on the presence of lipid rafts and cholesterol during virus entry. Once the virus is internalized, it migrates to caveolin positive vesicles that are trafficked to the perinuclear region and fused with caveosomes (Johnson and Vogt 2010). There is controversy over the nature of the \u201ccaveosome\u201d once it was found to be an artefact of fixing/staining procedures (Parton and Howes 2010; Engel et al. 2011). The number of non-clathrin, non-caveolin-mediated endocytosis mechanisms and molecular identities involved in this process are not completely resolved due to the lack of proper biomarkers. This process requires a receptor-mediated conformational transition for efficient cargo internalization (Damm et al. 2005; Grassart et al. 2010). Alternatively, endocytosis independent of clathrin and caveolin was proposed to be similar to phagocytosis, which transports cargoes using vesicles such as phagosomes (Suzuki et al. 1985).",

HCV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which consists of three steps: virus attachment, receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal fusion. After initial attachment of HCV to the host cell surface mediated by heparan sulphate (HS) chains from heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG), more specifically syndecan-1 (SDC1) and SDC4, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), the virus interacts with: (a) co-receptors such as scavenger receptor class B type I (SRBI), CD81, claudin-1 (CLDN1), occludin (OCLN), (b) entry factors such as EGFR (Hu et al. 2018), ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2) (Zhang et al. 2018), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and (c) cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which collaboratively complete endocytosis (Figure 3(A)). At the final step, the fusion process is triggered in a receptor-independent but pH-dependent fashion and is dependent on the lipid composition of the target cell membrane (Haid et al. 2009; Shi et al. 2013; Lef\u00e8vre et al. 2014). Specifically, CD81 and CLDN1 naturally form a complex under the regulation of EGFR and the GTPase H-Ras; HCV interacts with the CD81/CLDN1 complex followed by interactions with OCLN that ultimately lead to its internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Banse et al. 2018). The critical role of tight junctions is emphasized by the indispensability of both tight junction proteins CLDN1 and OCLN.",

Over 50 kinases have been identified to regulate SV40 entry and its early infection steps (Pelkmans et al. 2005). Nonetheless, lipid rafts and cholesterols are required for virus entry, and an acidic condition is needed for triggering the disassembly of capsid and viral genome release (Kosukegawa et al. 1996). Thus, SV40 first binds to the host cell surface and diffuses along the membrane until it reaches a caveolae. Next, the virions are endocytosed into caveolin-1-coated vesicles, which later converge into a caveosomes followed by the budding of caveolin-1-devoid vesicles that deliver the virus to ER.",

The existence of three cellular receptors, the paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor-\u03b1 (PILR\u03b1), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA), of viral gB has been widely accepted. While the expressions of PILR\u03b1 and MAG (which share 5\u201312% homology) are limited to certain cell types (Suenaga et al. 2010), NMHC-IIA is ubiquitously expressed in numerous human tissues and cell lines (Vicente-Manzanares et al. 2009). The gD receptors are indispensable for triggering virus entry into the cells. There are three classes of gD receptors which belong to structurally unrelated molecular families. HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator) is the first identified gD receptor, which belongs to the tumour necrosis factor receptor family, and is expressed in a variety of cell types. The second class of receptors includes nectin-1 and -2. While both nectins are broadly expressed in a wide range of human tissues and cell lines, nectin-1 is expressed on all tested cell lines sensitive to HSV-1 and HSV-2 invasion (Akhtar and Shukla 2009), and nectin-2 is a weak receptor for HSV-2 (Lopez et al. 2000). The third class refers to 3-O-Sulphated heparan sulphate proteoglycan (3-OS HS), a highly sulphated form of HS that recognizes HSV-1 but not HSV-2. The 3-OS HS has a lower cell surface expression than nectin-1. The interactions between gH and gL receptors regulate the fusion process. Thus, the gH-gL receptor, the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, the gB receptor and PILR\u03b1 collectively determine the entry pathway of HSV (Karasneh and Shukla 2011).",

            "text": "Trypsin plays an important role in direct penetration of RVs. Previous studies have shown that trypsin-untreated RV particles could successfully enter cells via the endocytic pathway. However, this event did not result in the release of viral genome into the cytoplasm and viral replication. Thus, trypsin-mediated cleavage is required for efficient RV infection (Suzuki et al. 1985). In particular, trypsin cleaves VP4 into VP8* and VP5*, which mediates the binding of SA-dependent and SA-independent viral strains to cells. Next, cellular integrins \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b14\u03b21, and hsc70 interact with VP5*, and integrins \u03b1x\u03b22 and \u03b1v\u03b23 interact with protein VP7 (Graham et al. 2003) in the subsequent entry processes. Although the exact molecular mechanism of the RVs\u2013host interaction is not completely understood, the current model proposes the interaction between VP4 and host cellular membrane, during which the trypsin-mediated cleavage releases VP8* from VP5* and exposes the hydrophobic domain of VP5*, leading to membrane disruption and viral penetration (Arias et al. 2015). The trypsin-mediated cleavage ultimately helps to dissolve the double-shelled viral capsid and cellular membrane. It was shown in vivo that VP4 is stable but non-infectious in the uncleaved state that is advantageous to resist environmental degradation until it infects a susceptible host, and becomes unstable but infectious once cleaved in the lumen of the host\u2019s gastrointestinal tract by trypsin (Ludert et al. 1996).",

The predominant form of SAs are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or NANA) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (Varki and Varki 2007) (Figure 5(C)). Neu5Ac is the primary SA form in mammalian cells (Varki et al. 2009). Neu5Gc not only exists in mammals (e.g. pigs, monkeys), but also in some bird species (except chickens (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017)). Besides, gangliosides (used by a number of SA-binding viruses) are present in most mammalian tissues, with the highest concentration being found in brain grey matter (Kolter 2012).",

            "text": "The roles played by SA in attaching all influenza A virus (IAV) strains have been extensively studied (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017). IAVs recognize two types of SA depending on the position where they link to galactose, i.e. \u03b12,3-SA and \u03b12,6-SA (Figure 5(D)). While avian IAV preferentially recognizes \u03b12,3-SA terminating glycans as receptors (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017), human IAV recognizes \u03b12,6-SA (Rogers et al. 1983). In this process, haemagglutinin (HA) mediates viral entry through binding to the cellular receptors and facilitates fusion of the virion membrane with the endosomal membrane (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017). Conversely, neuraminidase (NA) can cleave off the SAs from the cellular membrane and viral glycoproteins, facilitating the egress of nascent virions (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017; Du et al. 2019). HA and NA glycoproteins collectively determine the optimal level of HA affinity and NA enzymatic cleavage to allow for productive viral infection (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017). Similar attachment mechanisms are revealed in RV (Ruiz et al. 2009), CPV (Lofling et al. 2013), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) (Lofling et al. 2013) and PCV (Nauwynck et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Integrins are a large family of transmembrane glycoproteins found in a variety of organisms ranging from sponges, corals, nematodes, echinoderms to mammals (Srichai and Zent 2010). These molecules are heterodimeric receptors consisting of different combinations between 18 \u03b1 and 8 \u03b2 subunits, which form at least 24 integrins (Hussein et al. 2015) (Figure 6(A)). Each integrin subunit consists of three domains, the extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The extracellular domain is the largest part, ranging from 80 to 150 kDa (Srichai and Zent 2010). The transmembrane domain, a single-spanning structure comprising of 25\u201329 amino acids, is \u03b1-helical coiled coil structure and exists as homo- or heterodimer. Except for \u03b24, which contains over 1000 amino acids in its cytoplasmic domain, the cytoplasmic domain is a short unstructured domain comprising of 10\u201370 amino acids (Srichai and Zent 2010). Integrins can shift between high- and low- binding affinity states to transduce intracellular signals. In the inactive state, its extracellular domain is in a bent conformation and cannot bind to the ligands. Triggered by intracellular signals, integrins undergo conformational changes to expose the external ligand-binding site for efficient signal transduction from outside to inside (Schneider-Schaulies et al. 2001). Although the binding of some integrins requires an activation through alterations in the intracellular domain (inside-out signalling), other integrins can bind their ligands in the inactive state. On the other hand, ligands binding to the extracellular domain leads to subsequent transmission of cellular signals from outside-in (Arana et al. 2008). These functions make integrins important players in many critical signalling events including virus entry (Hussein et al. 2015). During cell invasion, viruses physically interact with integrins, many of which are localized to and associated with membrane rafts (Srichai and Zent 2010).",

Several viruses such as AVs and herpesviruses (HVs) harbour integrin-recognition motifs (displayed on the viral envelope or on the capsid), with RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) being the minimal peptide sequence for integrin binding. Over half of the known integrins recognize this motif and virus internalization is mediated in a RGD-dependent manner (Hussein et al. 2015). The non-RGD-binding integrins could also effectively promote virus entry, during which integrin binding facilitates adhesion, cytoskeleton rearrangement, integrin activation and enhances intracellular signalling (Hussein et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Members of the LDLR family have been found in a variety of species ranging from roundworms to vertebrates. Mammals express nine LDLRs, which share common motifs required for endocytosis (Figure 6(D)). These LDLRs are membrane glycoproteins consisting of the extracellular domain, mono-transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (Nykjaer and Willnow 2002). The extracellular domains of LDLRs comprise clusters of complement-type repeats required for ligand binding and epidermal growth factor precursor homology domains that are essential for the pH-dependent ligand release in endosomes (Nykjaer and Willnow 2002). The cytoplasmic domain harbours an NPxY (Asp-Pro-x-Tyr) motif, which is critical during virus internalization via clathrin-coated pits. Other studies demonstrated a dominant role of the YXXL (Tyr-x-x-Hydrophobic) motif during the endocytosis of extracellular cargo (Li et al. 2000). The natural ligands of LDLRs include lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100) or apolipoprotein E (ApoE), LDL or very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) respectively. The LDLR has been proposed as an entry factor for several viruses. For example, HCV virions interact with lipoprotein and apolipoproteins to form complexes termed lipoviroparticles. Studies have shown that lipoviroparticles are recruited to the cell membrane via interactions with LDLR (Agnello et al. 1999). In the case of HCV, the role of the LDLR-mediated uptake of viral particles is complex. It seems that the pathway does not lead to an effective viral infection (Albecka et al. 2012), and LDLR redundantly participates in the entry of lipoviroparticles (Yamamoto et al. 2016) that is important for optimal viral genome replication.",

            "text": "The success of the early steps of viral infection is determined by the interactions between viruses and cell attachment factors and internalization receptors. Polysaccharides, such as HS, or saccharide derivatives, such as SA, are frequently displayed on cell surfaces and are required for efficient virus attachment and entry into cells (Table 1). These protruding saccharide chains are conventionally attached to proteins forming proteoglycans, such as HSPG and SA proteoglycan. Proteoglycans are abundantly present in the ECMof virtually all mammalian cells. They have a fiber-like structures that render ECM elastic and adhesive (Esko et al. 2009). In addition to the sticky extracellular environment fostered, partially and primarily by proteoglycans, the polyanionic nature of HS and SA attached to them considerably enhances their ability to interact with positively charged viral glycoproteins. Glycosylation affects protein folding, modulates protein thermostability and is critical for virus attachment and internalization. For instance, JC virus (JCV) infection of host cells depends on its interactions with cell surface asparagine (N)-linked SAs and the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor (5-HT2AR) (Maginnis et al. 2010). However, saccharides are not feasible targets for the modulation of host cells, since glycosylation differs among species, requires additional enzymes and involves many technical problems. Glycosylation refers to the addition of a carbohydrate or glycan to a noncarbohydrate structure that can occur in almost all surface components including proteins and lipids. Glycosylation has many different forms such as N- and O-glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol glycosylation and lipid glycosylation, with the amount, distribution and type varying across species (Cagno et al. 2019). These characteristics substantially restrict glycosylation in being considered as targets for surface modulation. Moreover, although binding to saccharides is widely used by viruses for their attachment to the host cell, it has been shown that binding to saccharides is dispensable for infection in cell culture for numerous viruses (e.g. coronaviruses). For example, HSPG blockage results in the failure of SARS virus entry even in the presence of the internalization factor ACE2 (Lang et al. 2011). The SA alone enables the infection of influenza (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017) and paramyxoviruses (Villar and Barroso 2006). Nonetheless, the SA binding was shown to be dispensable for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection in cell culture (Schwegmann-We\u00dfels et al. 2011).",

Take TfR as an example, the PCV, which belongs to the Circoviridae family, shares the same Baltimore group II with the CPV that also uses TfR as the receptor (Misinzo 2005). This generalization applies to viruses of many other families, resulting in several representative (common) internalization receptors corresponding to viruses of all Baltimore groups. In brief, integrins are frequently used by double-stranded DNA (group I: dsDNA) and RNA viruses (group III: dsRNA); TfR is frequently recruited during the entry process of the single-stranded DNA viruses (group II: ssDNA); LDLRs commonly mediate the entry process of the positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses (group IV: +ssRNA); CD150 and Nectin4 are likely to facilitate the internalization of negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses (group V: -ssRNA) (von Messling et al. 2005; Pratakpiriya et al. 2012). We did not find any marked preference on receptor usage for the internalization of reverse transcribing viruses including both positive-sense single-stranded RNA retroviruses (group VI: ssRNA-RT) and partially double-stranded DNA hepadnaviruses (group VII: dsDNA-RT), which are excluded from the following discussions. Though the aforementioned associations are not absolute, it is reasonable to propose development of a semi-universal cell culture for the production of vaccines against most of viruses via expressing integrins, TfR, LDLR, and Nectin4/CD150 on the cell surface. To this end, we have identified the four critical receptors comprising the minimum panel for cells to be sensitive to a broad spectrum of viruses, namely preferred receptor panel (PRP). This hypothesis, once tested true, will aid in our efforts towards the establishment of novel cell system for cost-efficient vaccine production that is adaptable to new viral strains or emerging viruses. However, we are aware that viruses presenting totally different types of genome (classified into different Baltimore subtypes) may share the same organ tropism and entry factors such as in the case of HBV and HCV that both target liver and use EGFR (Lupberger et al. 2011; Iwamoto et al. 2019) and NTCP (Yan et al. 2012; Verrier et al. 2016) for viral entry, and those belonging to the same Baltimore group may use different receptors for cell entry such as the differential use of HVEM, Nectin 1/2, GFR, CD63, CD151 in mediating the entry of type I viruses besides integrin (Table 1).",

For instance, surface immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor mediates the entry of HBV to na\u00efve B cells (Lazdina et al. 2001), the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptor HAVCR1 is responsible for Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in the immune system (Manangeeswaran et al. 2012), and 2019-nCoV (novel coronavirus) that had recently led to the novel pneumonia outbreak in China (Huang et al. 2020) and SARS-CoV primarily use ACE2 for cell entry (Zamoto et al. 2006; Wu 2020). The reason we consider integrins, TfR, LDLR and Nectin4/CD150 as minimally required is because of their high frequencies in being needed during the invasion processes of various types of viruses as classified by the Baltimore system and the broad spectrum of virus families they cover, and other receptors can be considered alone or together with the PRP on an as-needed basis for cell line optimization to mediate the entry of a particular virus or alike. We did not include attachment receptors in PRP despite their high prevalence during virus entry as PRP, being a minimum receptor panel for cell optimization, includes the most representative and indispensable receptors that only those mediating the actual entry process meet this criterion. In addition, we did not claim that Nectin4 and CD150 are interchangeable; but rather, because of their similar frequency patterns in contributing to the entry of type V viruses, we would assume using one of them might be sufficient (which however should be experimentally tested). This obviously does not exclude the possibility that Nectin4 and CD150 interact and are both needed during virus entry.",

            "text": "The potential success of establishing an omnipotent cell line may also resolve several problems faced by vaccine production. There are several prevalent viruses that have no vaccine available such as CMV and EBV. Human CMV causes serious problems in immunocompromised or immunologically immature hosts; though many candidate vaccines including live attenuated CMV have been developed, none passed through the phase 3 clinical trial (Morello et al. 2007). Thus, the development of a vaccine to prevent human CMV infection has been assigned with the top priority by the US Institute of Medicine (Sung and Schleiss 2010). EBV is associated with a wide spectrum of cancers such as Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, smooth muscle tumours and HIV (Cohen et al. 2011). Thus, developing vaccines against EBV provides substantial benefits to human public health. However, no attempt for EBV vaccine development has achieved desirable outcome. For instance, vaccines against EBV glycoprotein gp350 (a common strategy for EBV vaccine development) failed to protect against EBV infection but did reduce the incidence of infectious mononucleosis (IM) by 78% (Sokal et al. 2007). On the other hand, establishing cells infectible by a broad range of viruses provides opportunities for producing vaccines against viruses that lack robust culture models. For example, primary cultures of human hepatocytes (PHH) are the primary in vitro model for HBV infection which, however, do not expand in culture, and have limited life span and supply (Zeisel et al. 2015). HepaRG cells can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells following a DMSO-mediated differentiation process, which are susceptible to HBV infection and support HBV cccDNA production. However, the differentiation process is time-consuming that may affect experiment reproducibility and reduce the infection efficiency. It was demonstrated that NTCP, a specific receptor mediating HBV infection, can increase cells\u2019 susceptibility to HBV, and hepatoma cell lines overexpressing NTCP could sensitize cells to HBV infection (Somiya et al. 2016). This opens the opportunity of establishing a cell line susceptible to HBV infection that is easy to culture by nature.",

The excessive number of family members of certain receptors imposes additional challenges in receptor selection. Integrins and LDLR are not single molecules but harbour multiple family members. Thus, selection of the appropriate family member of integrins and LDLR for the PRP is a critical and challenging task. Genetic modulation to enable expression of multiple receptors on the cell membrane with correct folding and modification imposes further concerns. One could, of course, modify genetically the cell line by introducing the receptors of the PRP sequentially (one by one) or use one (all-in-one) expression plasmid to introduce them as a whole. However, the former approach is time-consuming and challenged by the limited number of available selection markers especially when the construction of a plethora of receptors (e.g. separate expression of multiple domains of one receptor) was necessary; the latter approach is sometimes not feasible if the sequences encoding the receptors were too large (plasmid stability issues) that imposes a big challenge to cell transfection. Synthetic biology may offer great help here by redesigning the profile of cellular receptors that incorporate all the necessary biological parts (minimally required parts of the PRR) and assembling them into an integrate signalling transduction system.",

Interestingly, among the four representative internalization factors, integrin (groups I and III viruses) and TfR (group II viruses) function as dimers, LDLR (group IV viruses) and Nectin4/CD150 (group V viruses) are monomers. This observation suggests that there is an association between virus replication mechanisms and signal transduction mediated by internalization receptors.

            "text": "The type I interferon signalling plays a central role in host Defence that induces a plethora of antiviral proteins fight against viral invasions, which is activated on recognition of viral components via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) following the expression of multiple IFN-stimulated genes (Li et al. 2006; Chew et al. 2009). PRRs play differential roles on viral identification, i.e. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3/7/8/9 recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) including RIG-I and MDA5 detect RNA structures, DNA sensors such as cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, DAI and a few DNA damage response proteins identify cytoplasmic DNA (O\u2019Neill and Bowie 2010; Unterholzner 2013; Hornung 2014; Muller et al. 2019). Viruses have established various strategies to evade host antiviral responses. Take HSV-1 as the example, its tegument protein kinase US3 could reduce TLR3 expression to dampen TLR3-mediated antiviral response (Peri et al. 2008); its tegument protein UL36 could block IFN-beta production via deubiquitinating TRAF3 (a crucial component of the RLR-mediated pathway) (Wang et al. 2013); and by somewhat unknown mechanism HSV-1 infection could affect the stability and functionality of STING, an important adaptor for type I IFN induction by cytosolic DNA (Kalamvoki and Roizman 2014). Antiviral restriction factors, such as APOBEC3G, SAMHD1, Tetherin/BST-2 and TRIM5\u03b1 are important components of the first line of host defense (reviewed in Kluge et al. 2015; Colomer-Lluch et al. 2018). Generally, they are interferon-inducible proteins that block viral replication and propagation. These molecular mechanisms, developed by viruses to target the host defense system, can be utilized to artificially block the host antiviral responses through expressing, for example, the inhibitors of PRR signalling or by knocking down the expression of the antiviral restriction factors. Recently, one such attempt was made through a genome-wide screening of the host genes important for poliovirus (PV), IAV and RV replication, followed by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) knock-down of the selected identified genes (Murray et al. 2017). Using a panel of 12 different viruses, it was shown that inhibition of the selected host genes allowed for overcoming antiviral defenses and increasing host cells\u2019 (Vero and Hep-2) permissiveness and viral replication. Thus, it might be possible to create a universal or semi-universal cell line. One strategy to achieve this goal could be a combination of two approaches\u2014modification of the pro- and anti-viral genes together with the expression of the panel of receptors preferred by various viruses. However, artificially establishing a favourable cellular environment for viral invasion is not an easy task as it has to enable concomitant expression of multiple suppressors against various cellular defense pathways under precise time and spatial control without disrupting cell homeostasis. An alternative and, perhaps, more practical strategy, which we propose here, is to select cell lines with low and well-characterized innate immune profile as the starting material for developing a cell model that is susceptible to a broad range of viruses and genetically modify them with the PRP.",

(A) HCV entry process illustrating the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. \u2460HCV binds GAGs (HS from syndecan-1 and syndecan-4) and LDLR, which have high affinity for the ApoE (apolipoprotein E). SRBI (scavenger receptor B type I) plays an important role in both binding and post-binding steps of viral entry through interaction with virion-associated lipoprotein or HCV E2. \u2461Binding of SRBI to HCV particles allows exposure of CD81 binding sites on HCV E2 and transfer of the virus particles to CD81. \u2462The virion is primed by the low-pH fusion activity of CD81 and CLDN1 and translocates to the tight junctions in order to be endocytosed. Viral internalization is dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Junction protein occludin (OCLN) can contribute to this process. TfR1, EGFR, and EphA2 (ephrin receptor A2) play a role in HCV infection at the level of glycoprotein-mediated entry, acts after CD81, and possibly are involved in the HCV particle internalization. PI3K-AKT and PI4K pathways are engaged in the late step of HCV entry. However, the molecular mechanisms need to be investigated. \u2463Following internalization, HCV fusion occurs in the early endosomes. Low pH environment and virion-associated cholesterol are required for the fusion process. NPC1L1 may play a role in this process via cholesterol transport. After fusion between the viral envelope and an endosomal membrane, the viral genome is released into the cytosol and replication takes place. Reprinted with permission from Zhu (2014).

HSPG is composed of HS and core proteins, with the HS structure being shown in the upper panel and a fragment amplified in the lower panel for details. HS biosynthesis is initiated by the attachment of xylose to specific serine residues in the HSPG core proteins followed by the formation of a linkage tetrasaccharide, glucuronic acid-galactose-galactose-xylose (GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl). Extl3 attaches the first N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residue and an enzyme complex composed of Ext1 and Ext2, alternately adds GlcA and GlcNAc to the nascent chain. The chains simultaneously undergo a series of processing reactions that begin by the removal of the acetyl groups from clusters of GlcNAc residues and substitution of the free amino groups with sulfate, catalyzed by one or more N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferases (Ndst). The C5 epimerase (HsGlce) epimerizes the D-glucuronic acids immediately adjacent to N-sulfoglucosamine units to L-iduronic acid (IdoA). A series of O-sulfotransferases can then add sulfate. As shown in the top of the figure in red shading, the modifications occur in clusters of variable length (N-sulfated or NS domains), which are interspersed by unmodified domains (N-acetylated or NA domains). The modified domains make up binding sites for protein ligands as depicted for antithrombin, FGF and FGF receptor. (B) Schematic depiction on the global structure of two types of typical HSPGs. Syndecans are transmembrane proteins that bear HS chains distal from the plasma membrane. Some syndecans also contain ChS chains, which, by homology to syndecan-1, are located close to the membrane. Glypicans are covalently linked to a phosphatidyl inositol in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (GPI-linked). The HS chains are located on a likely extended protein domain near the plasma membrane. The glypican ectodomains are presumably compact and globular proteins as featured by 14 conserved cysteine residues. (C) Structure of the two common forms of SA, Neu5Ac, and Neu5Gc.

CD46, CD150 and Nectin4 are all transmembrane receptors sharing similar structures, and are expressed in all nucleated cells, immune cells and epithelial cells, respectively. \u2460 CD46 structure consists of four short consensus repeats (SCRs I, II, III, IV), a serine/threonine/proline region (STPs A, B, C), a sequence of unknown significance (U), a transmembrane sequence and a cytoplasmic domain. \u2461 CD150 contains a variable (V) domain and a constant (C2) Ig-like repeat in its extracellular domain. CD150 is the universal immune receptor for all morbilliviruses. \u2462 Nectin4 extracellular domain is composed of a variable domain and two C2 domains. To date, Nectin4 was shown to serve as an epithelial receptor for MV, CDV, and PPRV. Reprinted with permission from Delpeut et al. (2014). (C) Structure of TfR monomer and dimer. \u2460 TfR monomer.

All members share common motifs, including a single membrane anchor, complement-type repeats (ligand binding domains) and EGF precursor homology domains (required for acid-dependent release of ligands in endosomes). NPxY designates the four-amino-acid motif Asp-Pro-x-Tyr, which is proposed by some studies to mediate the clustering of the receptors into coated pits. O-linked sugar domains are found in some but not all LDLR species, which are considered to function as a hydrophilic spacer keeping lipophilic ligands away from the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane.
