Over 9% of the US adult population meet criteria for morbid, or severe (Class III) obesity, with a BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 . Other westernized countries have also noted increasing prevalence of obesity. 2 Obesity is known to influence the vast majority of major cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) risk factors, including dysglycemia, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), elevated blood pressure and hypertension (HTN), with adverse effects on CV structure and function. 3, 4 Additional morbidity includes chronic lung disease, asthma, and systemic inflammation. 4, 5 Not surprisingly, almost all forms of CVD are increased in the setting of increased adiposity, 6 especially heart failure (HF), especially HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), as well as HTN, coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and peripheral arterial disease. 4, 5, 7, 8 Many reports identified obesity and severe obesity as risk factors for hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and mortality from H 1 N 1 Influenza. 9 Obesity increases the duration of virus shedding of influenza A virus. 10 Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified severe obesity (i.e., BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 ), as a common clinical risk factor for worse prognosis and higher mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. 11 Furthermore, any degree of obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ), has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. 12 \u00a9 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

            "text": "We and others proposed the \"obesity paradox\", which suggests that overweight and those obese with established CVD appear to have a better short-and medium-term prognosis compared with their lean counterparts. We believe that this obesity paradox is \"heavily\" influenced by physical activity (PA) and fitness, since generally those with high PA and fitness have a good prognosis regardless of weight, whereas the leaner patients with CVD and low PA/fitness have particularly poor prognosis. 4, 5, 7, 13, 14 Nevertheless, many obesity and CVD prognosis papers do not include data on PA/fitness. We have demonstrated this obesity paradox in patients with lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary embolism, 15, 16 as well as in patients with advanced renal disease. 17 However, evidence suggests that obesity may be detrimental in COVID-19 patients, 18 with potential for more development of disease, worse outcomes, including respiratory and multiple organ failure, and higher mortality (Figure 1) . 1,12 19,20 Interestingly, ageing and obesity share numerous causative mechanisms largely linked to a dysfunctional adipose tissue, such as metabolic dysfunction, multi-organ damage, endocrine disruption, impaired immune function, and chronic inflammation. 21",

The obese population have more adipose tissue and consequently higher levels of ACE2 (Figure 2, right panel) . 23 The affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 is several-fold higher than the affinity between ACE2 and the former SARS-CoV. 24 The presence of ACE2 may enable the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into adipocytes, which makes adipose tissue an important viral reservoir. 20 Accordingly, adipose tissue might also be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and allow spread to other organs. 25 Moreover, obesity, along with low PA/fitness, is the leading cause of T2DM, and T2DM is also causally linked with elevated ACE2 expression. 26 Cells expressing ACE2 are also connected to progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 20",

Adipocytes may substantially contribute to the production of circulating angiotensinogen, which after metabolism by renin and ACE, produces angiotensin II (Ang II). 27 As such, obesity may lead to an overactive RAAS (Figure 2, left panel) . In a small study by Liu et al., 28 patients with COVID-19 were shown to have elevated levels of Ang II that correlated with severity of lung injury measured by PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio. High levels of Ang II in the lung can induce pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia, as well as inflammation and oxidative damage, promoting acute lung injury. 29, 30 In obese individuals with T2DM, Ang II levels were shown to positively correlate with body weight. 31 Thus, the elevated baseline Ang II in the obese may exacerbate COVID-19 induced Ang II increase, leading to more severe lung injury. Interestingly, Ang II levels decreased in response to dietary weight loss. 31 As such, dietary modification and PA may be beneficial at reducing this potential mechanism of enhanced COVID-19 disease in obesity.",

Obesity is also linked to other numerous risk factors for CHD, i.e., T2DM, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, HTN, and MetS. 33 Importantly, T2DM and HTN themselves also represent a frequent comorbidity in COVID-19 patients. The risk for CHD is higher in people with \"central\" or \"visceral\" obesity (concentrated in the abdomen). Likewise, obesity is one of the leading risk factors for AF; in many cases, AF is present in obese with HF, especially HFpEF. 32 Accordingly, the pathways among obesity, HF and AF are all closely related. 32 In effect, AF is a common comorbidity present in severe forms of COVID-19, which may lead to a worse prognosis or even higher mortality. In a report published by the Italian National Institute of Health, approximately onequarter of patients who died for COVID-19 had AF, which was hence the fourth most common condition in these patients. 34 Moreover, data provided by the New York State Department of Health also reported that AF is among the top ten COVID-19 comorbidities, specifically occupying the seventh position. 35 In this regard, Mehra et al. 36 have recently reported that cardiac arrhythmia is independently associated with an increased risk of inhospital mortality in 8,910 COVID-19 patients.",

Varga treatment, particularly for more vulnerable patients with worse prognosis (i.e., patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction associated with male sex, chronic respiratory diseases, HTN, T2DM, obesity, and established CVD). 40 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also among the top ten COVID-19 comorbidities. 35, 41 Obesity provokes structural and functional changes at the nephron level, including podocyte dysfunction with decreased podocyte density and number, podocyte hypertrophy, glomerular capillary hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulomegaly, and a secondary adaptive form of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in the long term. 37 Besides, central adiposity decreases estimated glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, as well as increases filtration fraction, leading to sub-nephrotic proteinuria. 37 Overall, obesity increases the odds of developing two of the major risk factors with direct impact on the progress to CKD, i.e., T2DM and HTN, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 42 Again, therapy with ACEi and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to protect the kidneys and delay progression of CKD in T2DM patients, being the preferred drugs in CKD patients. 43 For that reason, and in agreement with Varga et al., 40 ACEi/ARBs may be recommended as part of the treatment armamentarium for COVID-19. 44 Whether ACEi is more recommendable than ARBs or vice versa, Mehra et al. 36 showed that ACEi were independently associated with a reduction in mortality in a subgroup with hypertension whereas ARBs were associated with no increased risk of in-hospital death . In an even larger study of 96,032 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from across 6 continents, Mehra and colleagues were able to re-confirm the association of use of ACEi therapy with a reduced mortality, whereas ARBs had a neutral effect. 45 Finally, immune dysfunction is also linked to obesity, with increased susceptibility to infection or bacteremia. 46 ",

In obese patients with CHD and/or HF, survival rates are excellent regardless of adiposity when fitness is preserved. Thus, improving fitness via PA/ET is needed for primary and secondary prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality in obese populations. 14 Maintain body weight and remaining fit represents a crucial goal for possible future pandemics.",

Likewise, obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and its effects on the immune system play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, it also results in metabolic dysfunction, which may lead to dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, CVD, MetS/ T2DM, and HTN. Older age also represents a risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Clearly, prevention of obesity in the first place, and especially, its progression to more severe forms is desperately needed throughout the healthcare system and society. These efforts are also needed to help improve prognosis in the next pandemic, as well as for primary and secondary prevention of CVD and DM. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should recognize that the obese, and more so the more severely obese, are at higher risk of clinical deterioration with COVID-19. As such, these patients need to be carefully monitored and treated more aggressively to reduce morbidity and mortality.",

Figure 2 . Scheme of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in obese individuals. Increased production of angiotensinogen by adipose tissue leads to elevated Ang II in obesity. SARS-CoV-2 attenuates metabolism of Ang II by binding to ACE2 promoting a system imbalance. High Ang II leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammation that contributes to acute lung injury (left side of the figure). ACE2 expression in adipose tissue is higher than that in the lung, a major target organ affected by COVID-19. Increased ACE2 expression in adipocytes may make them more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and a potential viral reservoir leading to a prolonged viral clearance (right side of the figure).

Compared to normal weight, the obesity group showed 2.42-fold higher odds of developing severe pneumonia after adjusting for potential confounders. The odds ratios (95% CI) for severe pneumonia in overweight andobese men was 1.96 (0.78-4.98) and 5.70 (1.83-17.76), respectively. Simonnet and colleagues 63 described that obesity represented a risk factor for severity in COVID-19 patients. These authors retrospectively analyzed BMI and other outcomes among 124 consecutive COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). COVID-19 patients with BMIs > 35 kg/m 2 had more than 7-fold greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than patients with BMI <25 kg/m 2 (OR, 7.36, 95% CI, 1.63-33.14; P=0.02). Overall, 47.5% of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU had BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 , 13.7% had BMI between 35 and 39 kg/m 2 and 14.5% had BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 , respectively.
