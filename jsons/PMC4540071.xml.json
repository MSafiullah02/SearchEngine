The absolute CFR has an obvious role\u2014it provides a measure of the severity of the disease. For setting public health priorities, an order\u2010of\u2010magnitude estimate of the absolute CFR may be adequate, and sophisticated methods may not be needed. Once the severity of the disease has been established, the relative CFR takes on primary importance as it becomes the guiding principle for targeting interventions to those populations that are most at risk of severe outcomes. In the 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) we have a prime example. Early on, limited supplies of antivirals were the only option for prophylaxis and treatment of the disease, and public health agencies needed to decide how these should best be deployed. Later, as limited vaccine became available, officials had to prioritize subpopulations for vaccination. In many cases, targeting decisions came down to the relative severity of disease in different populations, i.e., the relative CFR. Hence, accurately estimating this quantity early in an epidemic in a changing surveillance environment is of great importance.",

(2005) developed methods to address the challenge of estimating the CFR in real time when the survival distribution of the disease is not known and when not all infected cases have died. Also motivated by the SARS epidemic, Jewell et al. (2007) developed nonparametric methods to estimate the CFR using a competing\u2010risks framework from survival analysis.

(2009) gave a concise summary of the issues surrounding accurate estimation of the CFR. They proposed an estimator that adjusts for the survival distribution of influenza but not for changes in reporting. Nishiura et al. (2009) developed methods to estimate the CFR in the middle of an epidemic. This method adjusts a na\u00efve estimator (which divides the total number of observed deaths by the number of observed cases) based on information about the (assumed known) survival distribution of the particular disease. These two papers proposed analogous estimators, similar to what we propose as the E\u2010step of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the lag\u2010adjusted estimator (see Section 3.3 below). However, neither of these recent works investigated the effects of changes in reporting rates on their estimate of the CFR. Other papers have taken more direct approaches to estimate the CFR, using surrogate measures for the number of individuals who become infected and who die (Presanis et al., 2009) or simply by making ad hoc adjustments to the observed case counts to account for underreporting (de Silva et al., 2009; Donaldson et al., 2009; Wilson and Baker, 2009).",

We define Dtj as the number of reported deaths with symptom onset at time t for covariate level j.

We relax this assumption in our discussion of varying survival times in Section 3.3). Also, Stj is the reported number of recovered cases with onset at time t for covariate level j. Therefore Ntj=Dtj+Stj. However, underlying the reported data are recovered cases and deaths that go unreported.

For example, reporting rates may improve over time as an outbreak develops and public health surveillance teams are mobilized. However, at any given time, the detection rates may be identical for, say, men and women. In a constant proportion model there is a constant factor which relates the reporting rates of cases to that of deaths. This type of model might be appropriate in nonoutbreak or endemic disease contexts. Finally, in a complete fatality reporting model, we assume that the reporting rate for recovered cases does not vary by covariate group and that the reporting rate for fatal cases is nearly 100%.

This holds for distributions with short survival times (scenarios A\u2013E) as well as those with long possible survival times (scenarios F\u2013J). In the 10 scenarios we studied, the MSEs for the lag\u2010adjusted estimates that assumed a known survival distribution with the same mean as the truth were an order of magnitude smaller than those for the reporting\u2010rate\u2010adjusted estimator and two orders of magnitude smaller than the na\u00efve method.

When the true survival distribution was short but we assumed a long distribution, we overestimated the relative CFR. When the true survival distribution was long but we assumed a short distribution, we underestimated the true relative CFR.

Covariate independence implies that at every month t, the rates of case reporting are the same across all counties and the rates of reporting of deaths are the same across all the counties. The following inclusion criteria were chosen to control for county\u2010level factors that we believed could impact reporting rates. The county must (1) have a hospital, (2) have population density less than 100 individuals per square mile, and (3) not contain military bases or installations. Eight counties met these criteria: Carroll, Cecil, Dorchester, Frederick, Somerset, Talbot, Washington, and Wicomico counties.

For example, if the case reporting rate was higher in counties with higher white population, this may increase the denominator for estimating the CFR when compared with the other counties, leading to a reduction in the estimate of the relative CFR.

This is likely not true for a covariate such as age, as surveillance may more easily target school\u2010age children than adults. But it may hold for other covariates such as gender or geographical location. Another limitation is that delays in reporting not due to survival times are not accounted for in this model. If these delays are uniform across all cases, then this may not introduce bias. However if the delays are different for different subgroups, this may impact the performance of the proposed estimators. Also, when using the lag\u2010adjusted estimator, we assume a survival distribution for the disease in question. Our simulation results (see Section 4.2 and Web Appendix D) suggest that knowing the exact distribution is not vital as long as it the center of mass is roughly centered on the truth (Table 4), although it may increase the estimated variance of the estimates (Web Table 4). However, knowing the center of mass of a survival distribution may be difficult with an emerging pathogen. An in\u2010depth analysis could provide more detailed information about the performance of these methods.",

However, an avenue for further research could be to find ways to adapt this method to work for diseases with larger CFRs. We also assume that the CFR does not change over time.

Either way, the ability to test whether there is evidence that the CFR is different between two locations (while controlling for a second covariate) could be a helpful addition to this model.
