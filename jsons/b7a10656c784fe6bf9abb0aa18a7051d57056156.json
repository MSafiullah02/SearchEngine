This decision tree allows not only a collection of data but also a secured organisational process for patient orientation and an optimal physician medical time. Our experience could help other cancer centres, or even healthcare organisations, to implement a rapid effective programme with healthcare professionals monitoring patients at distance while being less exposed.
