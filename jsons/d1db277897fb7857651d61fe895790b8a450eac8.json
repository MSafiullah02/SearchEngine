It has been found that the nucleocapsid protein (N) and spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV can directly bind to the promoter of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene, which drives overexpression of COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner. [1, 2] Homologous analysis showed that there were 90.6% and 75.8% similarity of the N and S protein between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 infection might also hold the potential to induce COX-2 overexpression in lung epithelial cells, resulting in a significant accumulation of prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ).",

Celebrex, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, effectively decreased the level of urinary PGE 2 and promoted the recovery of COVID-19. However, we also found that, in some cases, discontinuation of Celebrex might lead to increased PGE 2 and pneumonia relapse, such as experimental cases E1 and E9, whose PGE 2 levels were rebounded and increased quickly accompanied with slightly worsen of pulmonary opacification ( Figure S2 ).

After being centrifuged at 13000g for 15 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 2x volumes of ddH 2 O (0.1% HCOOH) and analyzed by the Agilent LC-QQQ 6470 with a 1290 HPLC. PGE 2 was separated by using Zorbax Eclipse plus C18 3.0\u00d7150 mm (1.8 \u03bcm) with a 10 minute linear gradient acetonitrile (0.1% HCOOH), and measured by monitoring m/z 351.1 to 271.3 under MRM with negative ion.",

It was found that both viruses infected host cells by using the S protein to bind Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.[16] Thus, It suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might also have the ability to induce the expression of COX-2 in lung epithelial cells.",

While combining zanamivir with Celebrex (COX-2 inhibitor) or with mesalazine (COX inhibitor) could improve the survival to about 20%. However, a combination of these three drugs significantly reduced viral load and increased survival up to 53.3%.[18] Although there is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19 today, we supposed that Celebrex combined with antivirus and other antiinflammatory drugs treatment might be a good strategy for COVID-19 treatment. There are no reports on whether Celebrex is involved in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Although some studies have found that COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors have the potential to inhibit replication of other subtypes of coronavirus. For example, Raaben et al reported that indomethacin and curcumin (COX non-selective inhibitors) inhibited the synthesis of RNA, protein, and production of virus particles of mouse hepatitis coronavirus in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro experiments showed that both SC-560 (COX-1 inhibitor) and NS-398 (COX-2 inhibitor) reduced mouse hepatitis virus (coronavirus) infection by 65-75% at concentrations that were nontoxic to the cells.[19] Santoro et al reported that indomethacin directly inhibited the production of SARS-CoV and CCoV virus particles, reduced cell infection in vitro and in vivo.[20]",
