Even as scar the cuneiform figure will remain. At the border of the infarct, numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages will appear. Elastic stains can easily highlight obstructed arteries. Typically there are thick-walled arteries in the vicinity of the infarct, probably reflecting increased vascular pressure.\n",

The necrosis of endothelia is the most important sign of vasculitis, because in the differential diagnosis, transmigration of neutrophils in infections can be very prominent and therefore cannot be regarded as the proof of vasculitis. More often vasculitis causes thrombosis and vascular occlusion, which consequently lead to infarction and necrosis of the parenchyma.

Vasculitis typically develops in a previously asthmatic middle-aged patient. Asthma is severe, associated with eosinophilia and extrapulmonary symptoms. Some patients report allergic rhinitis without asthma. Most frequently EGPA involves the peripheral nerves and skin (allergic superficial eosinophilic vasculitis). Other organs such as the heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, if affected, confer a poorer prognosis. In about 30\u201340 % of the patients, anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) are present [2]. EGPA patients with anti-MPO ANCA suffered more, albeit not exclusively, from vasculitis symptoms, such as glomerulonephritis, mononeuritis multiplex, and alveolar hemorrhage, whereas ANCA-negative patients more frequently develop heart involvement [6, 7]. In recent time EGPA has been linked to new antiasthmatic drugs such as montelukast. However, new investigations have ruled out this as a possible cause of the disease [8].",

Activin-like kinase type I (ALK1) was found altered in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Since both genes belong to the TGF\u03b2 family, this pathway might be most probably affected [31]. BMP receptors 1 and 2 associate to form homo- or heterodimers. BMP4, a ligand for BMPR2, inhibits the proliferation of arterial muscle cells from proximal pulmonary arteries but stimulates proliferation of peripheral arteries. In iPAH hypoxia induces production of endothelium-derived BMP4, associated with increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.",

There are several underlying diseases, which can present with AHS. Within the differential diagnosis, they are vasculitis, primary systemic as well as secondary; pulmonary hypertension; autoimmune diseases including collagen vascular diseases; Goodpasture syndrome; antiphospolipid autoantibody syndrome (Fig. 11.24); infections such as tuberculosis, influenza virus, Hantavirus, SARS, dengue fever, and Nile virus fever; inhalation of herbicides and pesticides; and drug reactions, especially cytostatics.",

The histological picture will resemble edema; however red blood cells are missing, whereas scattered leukocytes are encountered. The septa are widened by this fluid. Leakage can also affect the pleura causing chylothorax. This malformation can be focal, involving the lung and mediastinum, but exists also as a systemic form, Gorham-Stout syndrome [36, 37]. In this case also the bones and many other organs are affected too (Fig. 11.25). These patients present with symptoms related to loss of electrolytes and small peptides/proteins. Most prominent is albuminemia. Patients are of young age or children. The diagnosis can be made by CT scan, because the multitude of cystic-dilated lymphatics within the mediastinum will simulate a cystic tumor. The local form will present as lymphangiosis, with the characteristic proliferation of lymphatic vessels (Fig. 11.26). As an aid in the diagnosis, antibodies against podoplanin and VEGFR can highlight the lymphatics3.\n\n",
