However, in a substantial number of patients with a respiratory tract disease, co-infection with various viral pathogens has been con fi rmed. Although the association between the occurrence of co-infection and substantially higher severity of disease is still unclear, a rapid and proper diagnostics of wide spectrum of viral respiratory pathogens reveals an accurate picture of the disease and is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and control of infection. In the present study we reported fi ve cases of multiple respiratory infection in hospitalized immunosuppressed patients: two double infections with in fl uenza virus (IV) type A/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A and IV type A/coronavirus (CoV) OC43, one infection with four viruses -IV type A/RSV type A and B/CoV OC43, and two cases of mixed infections caused by fi ve viral agents -IV type A and B/RSV type A and B/ parain fl uenza type 3 or CoV OC43. Each patient had an underlying chronic disease and received immunosuppressive treatment. Despite a low number of tested specimens, our study shows that the inclusions of multiplex PCR methods for diagnostics of respiratory tract infections and the extension of diagnostic strategies by clinicians to detect viruses other than in fl uenza are very important and make a contribution to identifying the true rate of co-infections and their correlation with the clinical symptoms and severity of disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human respiratory tract infections represent a major public health problem because they are associated with a high rate of hospitalization, signi fi cant morbidity, and mortality. They thus cause a considerable fi nancial burden on the health-care system throughout the world. The elderly and immunocompromised subjects with medical conditions are especially at high risk of developing severe course of infection and various complications. The most common respiratory viruses are in fl uenza virus type A (IV-A) and B (IV-B), respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSV-A) and B (RSV-B), parain fl uenza virus type 1, 2 and 3 (PIV-1, -2, -3), human rhinoviruses (hRV), human metapneumoviruses (hMPV), adenoviruses (AdV), human coronaviruses (hCoV), human bocavirus (hBoV) and enteroviruses (EV) (Do et al. 2011 ) . Infectious respiratory diseases caused by different viruses are characterized by a wide range of similar respiratory symptoms from mild cold to severe pneumonia. This makes the clinical distinction between different agents involved in infection very dif fi cult. Although the high rates of infection with more than one respiratory virus have been reported, especially in children (Table 36. 3 ), the real number of co-infections is undoubtedly underestimated, mainly due to sensitivity of diagnostic methods 293 36 Co-Infections with In fl uenza and Other Respiratory Viruses used and limited number of tested viruses. In majority of cases the most likely or casual viral agents are tested fi rst and the diagnostics stops with a detection of the primary relevant infectious agent.

Cell culture has been considered as the gold standard for virus diagnosis but is not adapted to all medically important respiratory viruses. In contrast to this method, PCR permits rapid detection of viruses that are dif fi cult to culture or have not been well replicated in vitro , such as hMPV, hCoV NL63 and hRV, with excellent sensitivity and specify (Calvo et al. 2008 ) . Additionally, viruses present in specimens may considerably differ with viral loads and rate of replication, and this would make the detection of slowly replicating pathogens dif fi cult. Therefore, numerous studies have been developed over recent years to evaluate the PCRbased methods for detection and typing/subtyping of respiratory viruses (Templeton et al. 2004 ; Bellau-Pujol et al. 2005 ; Gunson et al. 2005 ; Wu et al. 2008 ) . When a viral infection is taken into consideration, because of very similar and nonspeci fi c clinical symptoms caused by various respiratory viruses, the list of possible etiologic agents is very long. In contrast to monoplex PCR reaction, the use of multiplex PCR allows detecting various respiratory pathogens in a single reaction, including the identi fi cation of the type and the detection of co-infections with multiple agents, which could be missed by the monoplex reaction. The introduction of multiplex PCR to routine diagnostics revealed a higher prevalence of co-infections than has previously been reported by conventional techniques (Freymuth et al. 1997 ) . A review of the literature indicates that the rate of co-infections may range from approximately 15 to as high as 50% of all positive specimens (Table 36 .3 ). The majority of papers presenting the results of molecular assays for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses and mixed infections focus on pediatric patients, infants, and young children in whom viral shedding in the respiratory tract is usually much higher. In these patients, the respiratory syncytial viruses were the most common pathogen occurred in respiratory viral co-infection, the next most often identi fi ed viruses in mixed infection were hRV, PIV, hMPV, and others. There also are observed co-infections with different subtypes of in fl uenza A virus (Pajak et al. 2011 ) . The Seeplex TM RV Detection Kit has recently been found as a good tool for the detection of multiple infections caused by common respiratory viruses (Yoo et al. 2007 ; Do et al. 2011 ) , with sensitivity higher than viral culture assays (Drews et al. 2008 ; Roh et al. 2008 ; Kim et al. 2009 ; Lee et al. 2010 ) . Our fi ndings con fi rmed that co-infections are not a rare occurrence, particularly in immunocompromised patients with medical conditions receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Clinicians are inclined to use antibiotics in cases when the etiological agent of infection is not identi fi ed. Therefore, in spite of lack of speci fi c antiviral drugs and the symptomatic and supportive treatment in majority of respiratory viral infections, a rapid detection of viral pathogen may help avoid an inappropriate use of antibiotics. Moreover, the multiplex methods that enable detection of a broad spectrum of common viral pathogens are clinically desirable in case of speci fi c groups of patients: children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals who tend to have prolonged virus shedding and who are at increased risk of serious complications and mortality. Such tests allow detecting agents not primarily expected in a patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another important aspect of the identi fi cation of mixed infections is that the presence of more than one pathogen may in fl uence the course of infection; although the exact clinical signi fi cance of mixed infection remains unclear . In numerous studies that have described co-infections, no clinical differences among patients with single and multiple infections are reported, including the severity of disease, clinical signs of infection, their intensity, or duration of hospital stays (Brouard et al. 2000 ; Lee et al. 2010 ; Nascimento et al. 2010 ) . In contrast, Calvo et al. ( 2008 ) reported that infants with co-infections of RSV and one or more other respiratory pathogens have a signi fi cantly higher incidence of fever and the duration of hospitalization was longer in comparison to infants infected only with RSV. In the study of Richard et al. ( 2008 ) , a signi fi cant correlation between dual viral infection and increased severity in bronchiolitis was found and infants with co-infections were at 2.7 times higher risk for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit than those with single infections. The other signi fi cant factors that bore on the severity of infection were: age (<42 days), premature birth, and the underlying chronic disease. There were no statistically signi fi cant differences between host conditions, duration of assisted ventilation or of supplemental oxygen administration, and duration of hospitalization . Certainly, further studies for a better understanding of these various interactions and the clinical differences between single and multiple respiratory viral infections need to be carried out. Brunstein et al. ( 2008 ) suggested the occurrence of pathogen co-suppression, when infection with one pathogen reduces a risk for infection with others. Such interactions have been observed for the following viruses: RSV and IV; RSV-A and RSV-B; RSV and PIV; hRV and RSV/IV. However, in the present study we identi fi ed four cases of simultaneous infections with RSV and IV. Two of these cases were caused by RSV-A and RSV-B and one by both types of RSV and PIV. These four co-infected patients (P1, P2, P3 and P4) were hospitalized in the same unit, multiple infections were caused by four different combinations of only six viruses (IV-A in four patients, IV-B in two patients, RSV-A in four patients, RSV-B in three patients, hCoV OC43 in two patients, and PIV-3 in one patient) and all specimens were collected during 1 week, which all suggests a high probability of nosocomial transmissions.
