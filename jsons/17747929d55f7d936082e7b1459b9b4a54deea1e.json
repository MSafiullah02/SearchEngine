A large-scale outbreak of PED occurred in China in 2010, with PEDV emerging in the United States in 2013 and spreading rapidly, posing significant economic and public health concerns. In this study, LC-MS/MS coupled to iTRAQ labeling was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed cellular proteins in PEDV-infected Vero cells. We identified 49 differentially expressed cellular proteins, of which 8 were upregulated and 41 downregulated. These differentially expressed proteins were involved in apoptosis, signal transduction, and stress responses. Based on these differentially expressed proteins, we propose that PEDV might utilize apoptosis and extracellular signal regulated kinases pathways for maximum viral replication.

To date, no analysis has been reported for the differential proteomes of host cells infected with PEDV. Based on our findings, the expressions of 49 different proteins were significantly altered in PEDV-infected cells. These proteins were involved in a variety of processes including apoptosis, signal transduction, and stress responses of host cells. Our data are overview of the altered proteins during a host response to PEDV infection and should provide clues regarding PEDV pathogenesis. The apoptosis of host cells plays a major role in regulating the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases [22] . Apoptosis triggered by virus infection directly leads to viral pathogenesis; however, blocking apoptosis can avoid premature death of the infected cells, permitting a high titer of virus replication or a persistent infection [17] . In our analysis, two apoptosis-related genes, (14-3-3 and caspase-8) were identified following PEDV infection. The 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of conserved adaptor and scaffold proteins present in all eukaryotic organisms. Previous reports showed that 14-3-3 proteins modulate the cell cycle and apoptosis at multiple steps, leading to an inhibition of the onset of apoptosis [23, 24] . Our results demonstrate that decreased expression of four 14-3-3 proteins (eta, theta, beta/alpha, gamma) was concomitant with PEDV infection, and thus predicted to promote apoptosis of infected cells. Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase that is activated by the correlation between external apoptotic elements and cell surface molecules, playing fundamental roles in initiating the apoptotic cascade response [25] . The downregulation of caspase-8 expression in PEDV-infected cells suggests a mechanism that attenuates virus-induced apoptosis at the early infection phase, thus favoring a virus to replicate to a higher titer. In the case of SARS-CoV, stimulation of both apoptotic and antiapoptotic elements has been seen, allowing for rapid multiplication of progeny virus before cell lysis [26] . The interplay between apoptosis-related genes in PEDV infection might contribute to it achieving maximum viral replication before cell death.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 170, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 171, "end": 174, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 776, "end": 780, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1012, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1403, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1407, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1823, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2207, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Viruses are known to develop the ability to manipulate a variety of host cellular signal transduction pathways to facilitate virus survival.
