            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an important mosquito-borne viral disease, occasionally causing encephalitic symptoms [1]. Nowadays, it is extensively distributed in most Asian countries and was also recently reported from Australia [2]. The JE virus (JEV) is one of some 70 members of the genus Flavivirus belonging to the family Flaviviridae [3], the genome of which contains a linear, single-stranded positive-sense RNA (~11 kb long) that encodes 3 structural proteins including nucleocapsid (C), membrane (preM/M), and envelope (E) proteins, as well as 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [4]. Due to lack of a proofreading mechanism and an inability to repair errors during RNA synthesis, spontaneous mutations frequently occur which contribute to the formation of genetically diversified populations or so-called \u201cquasispecies\u201d in flaviviruses including the JEV [5].",

Possibly, this feature differentially occurs in different types of host cells [8]. In addition to gene mutations [9], RNA recombination, at least in some cases, can also serve as a factor helping a virus escape from accumulated deleterious effects in a viral population [10]. In other words, RNA recombination may serve as an alternate means to generate genetic changes [11] and likely produces a new form of RNA comprising genetic information from multiple sources [12].",

Therefore, a new virus may be generated through RNA recombination between different strains. Among arboviruses, at least the western equine encephalitis virus is believed to be a recombinant virus that arose from distant viral progenitors, including an eastern equine encephalitis virus-like virus and a Sindbis-like virus [19]. As a result, the ability to form unpredictable recombinant strains or species between virus populations is of considerable concern [20], particularly the possibility of RNA recombination occurring from cocirculated live-attenuated vaccine strains and wild viruses during synthesis of new RNAs [21, 22].",

To prepare the 5\u2032-end sequence, a primer (5\u2032-CTGCCAAGCATCCAGCCAAGTA-3\u2032, complementary to nt 895~916 of the 5\u2032-end of the T1P1 genome) was used for RT to synthesize the first-strand cDNA. Subsequently, another primer (5\u2032-TAATACGACTCACTATAGAGAAGTTTATCTGTGTG-3\u2032) containing a partial sequence of the T7 polymerase promoter used as a tag (italicized) at the 5\u2032-end (nt 1~18) of the T1P1 5\u2032-end sequence was used in the PCR to amplify a 934 bp DNA fragment. In the meantime, the primer 5\u2032-GTGTTCTTCCTCACCACCAGCTAC-3\u2032 (nt 10,946~10,969 at the 3\u2032-end of the T1P1 genome) was used for RT to generate cDNA. Another primer (5\u2032-GAAAATTATGTTGACTAC-3\u2032, corresponding to the sequence nt 10,320~10,337) was subsequently used for the PCR under conditions described above to amplify a 650 bp DNA fragment. Both types of PCR products were separately digested with the restriction enzyme, AatII; the resultant DNA fragments were ligated to form subgenomic DNA which contained both 5\u2032-end (nt 1~599) and 3\u2032-end (nt 10,367~10,969) sequences. Subsequently, the subgenomic DNAs were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to form a plasmid designated p(+)T1P1-5\u20323\u2032-UTR-I which contained an insert of a 1202 bp fragment.",

Specifically, the RNA amount of the T1P1-S1 strain remained at the baseline level until 12 hpi (3.81-fold change), compared with an increase of 169.72-fold at 24 hpi in C6/36 cells.

Thus, the rate of spontaneous mutations is a critical parameter modeling the genetic structure of viral populations [29]. The primary variation following a mutation may provide for further evolutionary processes, for example, selection and/or recombination [30]. Those in turn lead to the generation of viral strains which are more adept and fit in nature. RNA recombination is now believed to be a strategy for the evolution of many viruses [12], for instance, the poliovirus [31], hepatitis C virus [32], hepatitis D virus [33], and norovirus [34]. A variety of flaviviruses including dengue virus and JEV were also reported to carry out RNA recombination according to bioinformatics inferences [17, 35] and experimental demonstration [25].",

Of these, the former apparently occurs more commonly as it has been shown in the poliovirus [37], coronaviruses [38], and plant viruses [39]. This mechanism of viral RNA recombinations can further be divided into 3 types: precisely homologous, imprecisely (aberrantly) homologous, and nonhomologous [16]. Among these, precisely homologous recombination through a template-switching (copy-choice) mechanism is probably most common [40].

The result was parallel to our previous observation [25], showing imbalanced RNA recombination between BHK-21 and C6/36 cells. Looking at RNA accumulation of JEV in host cells, it takes longer, at least a 24 h difference, in mosquito cells to reach the level of that in mammalian cells. The stability of viral RNA was also shown by degradation of transfected single-stranded RNA fragments, either positive or negative sense, particularly in mosquito cells. It implicated that viral RNA is less stable at least at the early phase of infection by JEV in mosquito cells, which may result in delayed growth of the virus. Since transfected RNA fragments were degraded in both C6/36 cells and BHK-21 cells, RNase cleavage may be actually involved in viral RNA degradation to form small RNAs [41]. However, degradation of transfected RNA fragments in C6/36 cells was partially ameliorated by treatment with PAP, suggesting that viral RNAs are not completely degraded by the RNase cleavage pathway [42]. Perhaps RNA interference (RNAi) plays an important role in the related events [43].",

On the other hand, dsRNAs formed in invertebrate cells are usually cleaved to be siRNA that consequently degrades viral RNAs [46], leading to RNAi-mediated innate immunity [47]. Small RNAs ranging from 10 to 24 mer have been identified in C6/36 cells infected by West Nile virus [43]. We have also detected normal expression of Dicer-2 in C6/36 cells infected by JEV for 12 h although it was almost half of inhibition at 6 hpi (data not shown). As a result, dsRF-RNA of the JEV may have a great potential for viral RNA degradation at least in the early phase of infection in mosquito cells. This adjustment of RNA amount is believed to be the way for a delay in RNA accumulation and thus a lower frequency of RNA recombination of the JEV. In contrast, dsRNAs are recognized as a central component of IFN and therefore are incapable of mediating RNAi in mammalian cells [48]. Eventually, our results have shown that protection of RNA from RNase cleavage increases the efficiency of RNA recombination particularly in mammalian cells.",

In contrast, T1P1-S1 RNA, respectively, increased to 3.09-, 28.99-, 429.05-, 4396.07-, and 5487.75-fold, at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hpi in BHK-21 cells. The RNA amount of CJN-S1 also accumulated more slowly in C6/36 cells than BHK-21 cells, which remained at the baseline level until 12 hpi (2.36-fold increase) and had increased to 152.32-fold by 24 hpi in C6/36 cells. Although the amount of CJN-S1 RNA did not evidently increase until 6 hpi (1.35-fold change), it increased to 16.64-, 111.43-, and 554.87-fold at 9, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively, in BHK-21 cells. (b) Stability of viral RNA was evaluated after a fragment of (+)5\u20323\u2032-UTR-II RNA was transfected into BHK-21 or C6/36 cells. Transfected fragments were insignificantly degraded even at 3 or 6 h after transfection in BHK-21 cells while more obvious degradation appeared in C6/36 cells.",
