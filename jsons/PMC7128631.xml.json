            "text": "An emerging infectious disease is a disease that has newly appeared or whose incidence has increased in the past 20 years and is expected to increase further in the near future [1]. Many emerging diseases are also zoonotic, that is, they spread between animals and people and have an animal reservoir [2]. Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are a constant threat to worldwide human and animal health [1,2]. Viruses are notorious for encroaching on previously untouched habitats and hosts mainly due to changes to local ecosystems, are transported inconspicuously by travel, and can be accidentally imported via infected carrier hosts before the onset of clinical symptoms. The main drivers of emergence of viral diseases are increasing urbanization, changes in human behavior, and climate change [3]. Humans continue to influence global ecology with our ever-growing demands on land use and intensified farming to feed an increasing population, and our well-developed means of transportation allowing rapid global spread of infectious diseases. However, the successful replication of a viral pathogen in a host is a complex process involving many virus\u2013host interaction processes [4]. Most virus\u2013host interactions developed during the coevolution of the pathogen and the host, therefore, often leading to a host specificity of the virus that impedes interspecies transmissions. Nevertheless, viruses do sporadically cross species barriers into other host populations, including humans. A pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a new host, which involves multiple stages of replication where each of them may require adaptive molecular changes of the virus [5]. Many of these interspecies transfer events are dead-end, but sometimes viruses adapt to enable continuous spread from animal to animal or human to human. Many emerging viruses with inter-species transmission capacity have RNA genomes and as such have a high rate of mutation which facilitates adaptation to new target animals and humans. For example, influenza A viruses are notorious for their ability to jump to new host species, resulting in the regular appearance of new pandemic influenza viruses in humans, the latest one being the pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009 [6].",

If rapidly evolving virus populations repeatedly experience comparable environmental changes and similar selective pressures, then viruses may exhibit what is known as parallel evolution. The concept of parallel molecular evolution is the independent evolution of the same genotype or phenotype from distinct ancestors. Parallel adaptation occurs in the context of several viral behaviors, including cross-species transmission, drug resistance, and host immune escape, and its existence suggests that at least some aspects of virus evolution and emergence are repeatable and predictable. Gutierrez et al. introduce examples of parallel evolution of viruses and summarize key concepts.",

Host range is also determined by ecological factors extrinsic to the virus such as the distribution, abundance, and interaction of species. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and the complexity of biotic and abiotic interactions, must be considered in order to provide generalizations on patterns of transmission, host range evolution, and disease emergence of plant viruses.",

The burgeoning international aquaculture expansion and expanding global trade in live aquatic animals and their products have been accompanied by long distance geographical redistribution of aquatic animal species and their viruses. The outcome is a continuous emergence of viral diseases in aquaculture. Frederick Kibenge discusses multiple examples of emerging viruses in aquaculture. The best options for keeping abreast of the continuous emergence of viral diseases in aquaculture are at the farm level where improved disease prevention and control translate into a sustainable industry.",
