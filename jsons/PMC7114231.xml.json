The MeV genome contains six genes, such as N, P/C/V, M, F, H and L (Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001). The P/C/V gene is transcribed to the overlapping P/C/V mRNAs while the other genes each to a single mRNA. The MeV genes are flanked by the extragenic 3\u2032-terminal leader and the 5\u2032-terminal trailer regions, and are connected by short stretch of conserved sequences. These gene boundary sequences consist of three regions, called the transcription end, intercistronic and transcriptional start sequences, which function as the transcription regulatory sequences. The L mRNA encodes the L protein that contains the catalytic motif common to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of negative-strand RNA viruses.",

Although a combination therapy using interferon (IFN) and inosiplex (Anlar et al., 2004, Gascon, 2003) or ribavirin (Hosoya et al., 2004) appears to improve clinical conditions and survival time to some extent, there is currently no specific treatment available to cure patients with SSPE and a new treatment strategy for SSPE is greatly needed.",

However, little information is available so far on RNAi against MeV and SSPE virus infection. We report here that siRNAs targeted against L mRNA of MeV, either synthetic ones or those generated by pcPUR + U6i-based expression plasmids, effectively inhibit replication of both MeV and SSPE virus. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing effective inhibition of MeV and SSPE virus by means of siRNA.",

Therefore, viral mRNA encoding the L protein would be a good target for the RNAi strategy to inhibit replication of MeV and SSPE virus. Indeed, we demonstrated in the present study that siRNAs targeted against selected portions of L mRNA of MeV, especially MV-L2 -L4 and -L5, either synthetic siRNAs or those expressed by pcPUR + U6i-based plasmids, effectively inhibited replication of both MeV and SSPE virus (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The inhibitory capacity of these otherwise effective siRNAs became barely detectable, if any, when the siRNAs were transfected to the cells 24 h after MeV infection (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that, once virus replication reaches its maximal level, viral mRNA molecules have accumulated abundantly in the cells to a level beyond the inhibitory capacity of siRNA. This idea might discourage an attempt to use siRNA for therapeutic purposes. However, it should also be stated that siRNA renders neighboring, uninfected cells resistant to virus infection, preventing the viral spread to the neighboring cells. In fact, the spread of SSPE virus from persistently infected cells was efficiently blocked by MV-L2 siRNA (Fig. 3 A and B).",

The most likely explanation for this remarkably efficient inhibition is that virus-infected cells form syncytia through fusion with their neighboring cells, at least some of which are expected to harbor the siRNA-expressing plasmid, and that de novo-produced siRNA is introduced to the virus-infected cells by virtue of syncytium formation. Although some siRNAs may activate the IFN system (Kim et al., 2004, Sledz et al., 2003), the siRNAs used in our study were unlikely to induce IFN activation since they did not inhibit replication of EMCV (Fig. 2C). EMCV is known to be highly sensitive to IFN (Song et al., 1999, Taguchi et al., 2004). This result also indicates that the siRNAs used in this study do not bring about any cytotoxic effect.",

            "text": "Currently, there is no satisfactory specific treatment for SSPE and, therefore, the RNAi strategy might be considered as a potential therapeutic measure against this fatal disease. The sequence targeted by MV-L2 siRNA is well conserved across different genotypes of wild-type MeV and SSPE virus (data not shown). Considering its efficient silencing effect and the lack of cytotoxicity together, MV-L2 siRNA would be one of the good candidates for a clinical trial. However, a number of important issues should be addressed. It was recently reported that some viruses could escape RNAi by mutating the targeted viral sequences (Boden et al., 2003, Das et al., 2004, Gitlin et al., 2005, Leonard and Schaffer, 2005, Wilson and Richardson, 2005). Characteristic to an RNA virus, whose RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is error-prone, SSPE virus frequently undergo genetic mutations during its long-term persistence in a patient (Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001). Therefore, a combined usage of multiple siRNAs that target different sequences would be recommended. At the same time, the possible off-target effect(s) of each siRNA should be examined thoroughly. We also need to establish a good system to efficiently introduce siRNAs into the brain cells. We are currently generating recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing siRNAs against different portions of MeV/SSPE virus L mRNA. The usage of nonviral vectors, such as organically modified silica nanoparticles (Bharali et al., 2005), would be another promising option. In any case, the safety of the vectors when applied in vivo should be completely warranted.",
