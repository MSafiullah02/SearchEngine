Millions of people are affected by NDs [2], which are generally fatal. Some NDs have been associated with viral infections [1], [3], [4] and are commonly assumed to involve a chronic viral infection of the brain. However, repeated efforts to consistently detect specific virions, viral proteins, or viral nucleic acid in the brains of ND patients, even when highly sensitive molecular techniques are used, have generally failed [5], [6], [7], [8].",

            "text": "Extensive clinical evidence indicates that olfactory bulb (OB) degeneration is associated with all NDs investigated so far, and that impairment of odorant detection may precede clinically-apparent NDs by as much as 10 years [9], [10]. As the OB is anatomically linked to the nasal passages via the olfactory nerves (see \u201cTutorial on olfactory system anatomy\u201d), respiratory viruses could play a role in OB degeneration if they were able to traverse those nerves. Nerve transport has been demonstrated for some neurovirulent viruses (i.e., viruses that replicate in neurons, and spread from neuron to neuron [11], [12], [13]), but is generally assumed not to occur with non-neurovirulent viruses. However, highly sensitive molecular techniques have recently demonstrated that a mouse-adapted human influenza strain that is neither neurotropic nor neurovirulent can rapidly enter the mouse OB following intranasal instillation ([14], \u201cExperimental evidence supporting the hypothesis\u201d). In the OB the virus appears to be \u2018trapped\u2019 by glial cells ([14], \u201cMajor mechanisms of neuroinflammation\u201d and \u201cAn influenza animal model demonstrating a gliotropic infection\u201d) and initiate wide-spread neuroinflammation.\n1 Therefore, an alternative hypothesis to ND causation by a persistent neurovirulent viral infection is that over a person\u2019s lifetime, multiple \u2018common cold\u2019 and \u2018flu-like\u2019 viruses invade the brain from the nasal passages via the olfactory nerves. Such viruses are then captured and killed by glial cells in the OB, resulting in glial production of inflammatory mediators. These mediators, in turn, induce a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines in neurons and glia within olfactory cortical pathways and beyond with the potential to damage the neurons. The resulting brain damage is too limited to provoke classical neurological symptoms, but it accumulates over the individual\u2019s lifetime and can potentially contribute to the development of late-life NDs in genetically- or age-susceptible individuals. The key elements of this hypothesis are summarized in Fig. 1\n, and supporting evidence will be presented in \u201cExperimental evidence supporting the hypothesis\u201d and \u201cSupporting evidence from the literature\u201d.",

A wide variety of brain insults, both extrinsic [21] and intrinsic, can induce acute neuroinflammation (see Table 1\n); many of these insults occur through inhalation ([21], [22], Table 1) and can potentially cause OB pathology (see \u201cTutorial on olfactory system anatomy\u201d). While this article will focus on commonly-encountered viruses, it is likely that any systemic inflammatory event [23], inhaled toxic chemicals ([22], [24], [25], Table 1), or head trauma [26], [27], [28] will amplify neuroinflammation by inducing additive or synergistic inflammatory events [22], [24]. Gene polymorphisms affecting inflammation severity and persistence are likely to be important players in ND development [24], [29], [30], [31], regardless of the cause. The underlying assumption of the hypothesis is that neuroinflammation, if sufficiently severe, will lead to some level of neurodegeneration [32].",

The limitations of traditional viral brain invasion models (\u201cTraditional viral brain invasion models\u201d), together with the influenza work that has led to my hypothesis, is summarized in \u201cAn influenza animal model demonstrating a gliotropic infection\u201d. Some of the broader implications of the hypothesis are touched on in \u201cImplications of the influenza-OB model\u201d. Clinical evidence that common respiratory viruses affect olfactory function is summarized in \u201cClinical evidence of olfactory pathology caused by common respiratory viruses\u201d. Influenza-associated pediatric brain pathologies are discussed in \u201cClinical evidence of brain damage in pediatric influenza infections\u201d. Some viruses traditionally associated with human NDs are briefly discussed in \u201cAssociation of viruses with human NDs\u201d, together with recent studies of viruses interacting with glia rather than neurons. Host factors that are likely to influence susceptibility to viral brain invasion [34] or characteristics of the neuroinflammatory state [32] are described in \u201cHost factors influencing outcomes from OB invasion by common viruses\u201d. Limitations of the available data that support this hypothesis are summarized in \u201cLimitations of available experimental data\u201d together with important parameters for testing the hypothesis with other viruses (\u201cImportant parameters for investigating non-neurotropic viruses in the brain\u201d). Then some prophylactic and therapeutic approaches to minimizing neuroinflammation caused by common viruses, and perhaps other neurological insults listed in Table 1, are briefly discussed in \u201cSome approaches to prevention or treatment of respiratory virus-associated neuroinflammation\u201d.

As odorant sensing requires a distinct dendritic receptor and olfactory network for each odorant, the olfactory receptor genes comprise the largest single gene family in the mammalian genome [35] and the ONs contain millions of axons. These axons coalesce into 15\u201320 large axon fascicles, or filia, that comprise the olfactory nerves [13]. The filia penetrate a perforated bony structure in the skull above the nose termed the cribriform plate. At the point where the ONs enter the cranial cavity they form the outermost layer of the OB, i.e., the ON layer. The olfactory neurons synapse in the adjacent glomerular layer with mitral neurons that form the third layer of the bulb. After odorant signals from the glomeruli are further processed within the succeeding cell layers of the multi-laminate OB, the signals are then transmitted to the rest of the brain via neurons projecting primarily to the olfactory cortex and anatomically related structures adjacent to the OB [35].",

In vivo techniques now make it clear that microglia play a prominent role in neuroinflammation and serve as the convergence point for many NDs [20]. Microglia make up about 12% of the general brain mass [24] and are particularly densely distributed in the OB glomerular layer [43] and in the substantia nigra [24] targeted in Parkinson\u2019s. Microglia express neurotransmitter receptors [44], are regulated in part by neurons [44], and produce trophic as well as toxic factors for neurons [24]. When activated by pathogens, toxins, cellular debris or excitatory amino acids microglia release a broad range of inflammatory products such as eicosenoids, metalloproteinases, proteases [45], and oxygen and nitrogen free radicals [46] capable of damaging nearby cells. Activated microglia also produce the key proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1\u03b2 [47] and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 [48]. These cytokines, particularly IL1\u03b2, are toxic for neurons in vitro and in vivo and can induce neurodegeneration [49], [50]; when combined the toxicity of the two cytokines is synergistic [51], [52]. Activated microglial products also open the blood\u2013brain barrier to circulating inflammatory cells and blood-borne soluble mediators [53].",

While these IFNs are known for their anti-viral action, they also have a complex role in immune regulation [55], [56]. IFN\u03b1s induce numerous genes that could be relevant to NDs, including the chemokine MIP-1\u03b1 [57], [58] and IL-16, a marker for activated microglia [59]. Sustained expression of IFN\u03b1 in the brain leads to neurodegeneration [60]. IFN-induced gene polymorphisms appear to determine susceptibility to multiple sclerosis [61] and chronic hepatitis C infections [31]. IFN\u03b1 is not induced by bacteria or other microbes in substantial quantities [62], and therefore viruses are more likely to initiate neuroinflammatory processes driven by these mediators than are other infectious agents.",

The effects on OB invasion by PR8 of the following experimental variables remain to be investigated: (1) mouse gender; (2) pre-immunization with a related viral strain; (3) virus doses that infect but fail to make the animals ill; (4) viral strains that are more sensitive to IFN or other innate immune responses; (5) mice with chemically ablated olfactory nerve dendrites or transected olfactory nerves.\n4 There is also a need for ultrastructural studies of infected olfactory nerves to characterize the location of the virus in the nerve.

While there is a consensus that activated glia play a major role in ND development, the concept that commonly-encountered gliotropic viruses could initiate or contribute to age-related brain shrinkage, senile dementia or classical NDs (such as Alzheimer\u2019s) via glial activation has not been considered previously. The language of neurovirology employs the terms \u201cneuroinvasive\u201d, \u201cneurotropic\u201d and \u201cneurovirulent\u201d in the context of viruses infecting the brain, reflecting the focus on viruses that can directly infect and kill neurons and cause neurological symptoms as currently defined. But in recent decades, the glia (particularly the microglia) have received more attention, and this article attempts to broaden the framework of neurovirology to include \u201chit-and-run\u201d gliotropic viruses as possible players in the etiology of ND development.",
