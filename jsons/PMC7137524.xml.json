            "text": "Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (a gram-negative coccobacillus) and transmitted through the bite of chiggers [1]. Themortality of scrub typhus is reported to be as high as 24% in severe cases with multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) [2]. The diagnosis of scrub typhus is difficult due to the absence of the pathognomonic eschar, which is the characteristic clinical manifestations and varies widely (3\u201393%) [1]. Serology, biopsy, culture, and polymerase chain(PCR) reaction were routine diagnostic methods and had many defects in the diagnosis [3]. For example, the indirect fluorescent antibody test needs a four-fold rise in titers over a 14-day period [4]. Polymerase chain reaction testing is only used as confirmatory test, but not as a screening test, because of multiple pathogenic bacterium in the clinic [5]. The culture of Orientia tsutsugamushi was very difficult and dangerous, and should be accomplished at a special research institution [6]. Lymphohistocytic vasculitis was the pathological hallmark of scrub typhus on skin biopsy, but not definitive [1]. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been used in the diagnosis of other pathogens such as Leptospira santarosai [7], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8], Human Immunodeficiency Virus [9] etc. However, the use of NGS has not been reported in the case of Scrub Typhus. Here, Orientia tsutsugamushi was determined to be the causative pathogen by NGS technologies in a case of MODS, and the results contributed directly to the patient\u2019s dramatic diagnosis and treatment, resulting in a favourable outcome.",

High-quality sequencing data were generated by removing low-quality, and short (length < 35 bp) reads, followed by computational subtraction of human host sequences mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment. The remaining data by removal of low-complexity reads were classified by simultaneously aligning to four Microbial Genome Databases, consisting of virus, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. A total of 317 sequences of Orientia tsutsugamushi were detected in plasma sample with a total coverage of 0.99% (Fig. 2a). Orientia tsutsugamushi specific amplification was detected from plasma sample by PCR (Fig. 2b). The distribution of bacterial sequences (N = 518 reads) was identified in the patient\u2019s plasma including Orientia tsutsugamushi (N = 317, 61.20%), Propionibacterium, staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, sphingomonas, pseudomonas (Fig. 2c). Then, the anti-infection regime was changed to doxycycline (0.1 g oral bid) and azithromycin (0.5 g intravenous drops qd). After 5 days of treatment (19th July), the circulation collapse was recovered and the vasoactive drug was stopped. After 9 days of the treatment (23th July), respiratory failure was corrected and tracheal intubation was removed. The patient was removed haemodialysis and returned to the nephrology ward successfully on 30th July. Then, the patient had abdominal distension, elevated blood amylase, pancreatic exudation and haemorrhage by CT in 5th Aug (Fig. 1f, g) and anti-pancreatitis treatment was timely. After the patient recovered, he was then discharged on 20th Aug and returned to normal serum creatinine in 30th Sep by follow-up (Fig. 1a).\n",

The typical clinical manifestation of scrub typhus are the fever and eschar. Severe Scrub typhus infection could affect a variety of systems and lead to multiple complications, including meningitis, acute lung injury, myocarditis, hepatitis, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septic shock, and MODS [2, 8]. Unfortunately, because this patient had no specific eschar, he was misdiagnosed as \u201chaemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome\u201d previously. Moreover, condition still deteriorated into refractory septic shock and MODS rapidly, although CRRT, tracheal intubation and antibiotics were used during 3rd -5th days.",

Laboratory diagnosis is mainly done with serology, molecular assays, pathogen characterization and tissue culture,which is only supported by large scale laboratories. Serology would be positive after 7\u201310 days of illness and has poor sensitivity and specificity due to the lack of species identification techniques in the market. Besides that, cross-reactions among closely related members should be noticed [4]. Molecular assays (such as PCR tests) have the advantages of rapid and sensitive diagnosis when an eschar is still present. However, it is difficult to apply on time when the eschar is negative and the initial diagnosis is missed. Tissue biopsy, culture, and pathogen characterization require special laboratories to avoid biosafety risks [3].",

However, the use of NGS has not been reported in the case of Scrub Typhus. Indeed, in the 6th day after hospitalization (14th July), Orientia tsutsugamushi was determined to be the causative pathogen by NGS. Scrub typhus could also be treated effectively if it could be diagnosed in time [1, 11]. Doxycycline has been proved to the preferred drug in the treatment of scrub typhus, and intravenous doxycycline isolation or enteral doxycycline combined with intravenous azithromycin is the better choice in severe cases with shock or intestinal absorption difficulties [2].
