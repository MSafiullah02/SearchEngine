Thus, children with comorbid conditions other than mild asthma were excluded. Healthy, full-term infants were enrolled at birth and followed up to age 5 years. The VVC was the primary care provider for these children, and children were evaluated in the VVC for all well and acute care visits. All visits were conducted within the General Clinical Research Center, with care provided by the pediatric infectious diseases faculty and research nurse practitioners. Comprehensive care was offered to these children with doctors on call 24 hours a day; this increased the likelihood of capturing all illnesses in these children. Questions involving whether the child had atopy and/or food allergies were not specifically asked by providers, and so children with those conditions were not explicitly excluded from the study. Thirteen children were older than 5 years at their last visit and were also included in this study analysis. Four children were between 60 and 70 months, 4 between 71 and 80 months, 3 between 81 and 100 months, and 2 between 100 and 133 months old. During visits for illness, symptoms were recorded and nasal-wash samples were obtained and cultured for viruses. All studies were approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Parents provided written informed consent.",

All samples that were culture negative for PIV, RSV, adenovirus, influenza, as well as those associated with LRI were tested in our study. A random sample of available culture-negative URI specimens was drawn and tested alongside the LRI samples. Culture-negative URI specimens were randomly drawn from each quarter of each year on the basis of the number of samples available for a given quarter to yield approximately 25% of all specimens in each quarter. Of the 1735 URI culture-negative samples available, we tested 407. Thus, there were a total of 527 specimens with aliquots available for testing in our study (either culture-negative or HRV culture-positive), 190 from patients diagnosed with LRI and 407 from patients diagnosed with URI. On average, there were 24 (SE \u00b12.33) samples each year available for testing. Figure E1 (in the Online Repository available at www.jacionline.org) depicts the number of samples tested by year. Data from children who were infected with human metapneumovirus (HMPV), PIV, RSV, influenza, or adenovirus were previously published23, 24, 25, 26, 30 and were analyzed in this study by using our models for comparison with HRV.",

A similar model was used to compare the incidence of HRV species A versus C, adjusting for race, sex, and season. Both HRV-B and untypeable HRVs were excluded from analysis because of the small sample size. Month, year, and season were also factored into the analysis. Season was grouped into 4 categories: winter (December through February), spring (March through May), summer (June through August), and fall (September through November). Poisson regression was used to model the prevalence of diagnosis (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup, asthma, coryza, pharyngitis, and acute otitis media) separately as a function of HRV. Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations method was used to assess the association between HRV species (A, C) and classification of URI or LRI adjusting for race. A Poisson regression model was used to assess the seasonality of other respiratory viruses (HMPV, PIV, RSV, influenza, and adenovirus).

There was also a significant difference between males and females in the likelihood of having HRV-A versus HRV-C detected (P = .02; Fig 2, B). Female children had a 1.4-fold relative risk of contracting HRV-C compared with male children (95% CI, 1-2.1).

Again, season was marginally significant (P = .056), where children were more likely to be diagnosed with HRV-C in the winter months (Fig 2, A).

The original goals of the VCC were to conduct respiratory surveillance and investigational vaccine trials in otherwise healthy young children, and thus children with chronic conditions including moderate or severe asthma were excluded. Because of this, the sample size for patients with mild asthma was only 19, 10 of which were positive for any HRV. Even with this low number, we found a 2.86-fold relative risk of asthma diagnosis when patients were infected with HRV, but the precision of that estimate is wide (95% CI, 0.23-35.47).

One possible explanation is that viral interference alters seasonal peaks and prevalence between HRV-C and other HRV species.39 It has been suggested that HRV may interfere with several other respiratory viruses, such as adenovirus, influenza virus A, PIV, HMPV, and coronavirus, based on the fact these viruses are significantly less likely to occur when coinfected with HRV.40 Wisdom et al39 found that though 10.7% of singly infected patients had RSV, only 2.4% had RSV when coinfected with HRV-C. In one of our previous studies of young hospitalized children, HRV-C codetection was 10% compared with 23% for HRV-A (P = .037).41 Another explanation may be that HRV-C is more likely to be communicable in winter months. A recent study on guinea pigs suggested that influenza B was more transmissible (both with and without contact) at colder temperatures.42 Although it is unknown why HRV-C peaks in the winter, recent work from Japan also supports this trend. During the 2008-2009 season, researchers found that HRV-C was most common in December.15 In our study population because we observed a marginally significant trend over a 20-year period, it is likely that in Nashville the HRV-C burden is higher in the winter months. This suggests that rapid viral detection, particularly in winter months when HRV-C, RSV, and influenza all peak, could modify treatment.",

Thus, we could not directly compare HRV results with those previously obtained for some other viruses. Furthermore, rates of medical visits may have differed over time and among families in Nashville during the 21-year period. Breast-feeding rates were low in the study population, which limited power to detect any effect on infection; some studies show that breast-feeding may protect children from respiratory tract infections.44, 45 We also did not test healthy children for HRV, which has been shown to be present in asymptomatic individuals.46, 47 Strengths of our analysis include the prospective nature of the data and specimen collection, the use of molecular viral diagnostics with cloning and sequencing for HRV typing, and more than 2 decades of year-round recruitment. The demographics of children enrolled in this study were similar to those in the United States,48 and so our results should be largely applicable to the rest of the country. We did have slightly more black children in this study compared with the general makeup of the United States (34% vs 13% black in the United States48).

The temporal variation in virus detection we observed over 2 decades confirms that season is strongly linked with the likelihood of HRV infection and that HRV-C peaks during a different season than do other HRV species. These data suggest that HRV species can contribute to the severity of disease and asthma exacerbations in children and that certain HRV species are more common at different times of year. Further studies are required to better understand the pathogenesis of HRV species and their role in LRI and asthma to optimally target future diagnostic, preventive, and treatment strategies for specific HRV species and strains.Clinical implicationsSince 1982, HRV-C has been associated with lower respiratory illness, particularly during the winter. Rapid viral detection during winter when HRV-C, RSV, and influenza peak is necessary to modify treatment.\n",
