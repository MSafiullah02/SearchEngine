Although there is an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease may not be infected with COVID-19. The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating a STelevation MI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on 1) the varied clinical presentations; 2) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; 3) role of the Emergency Department, Emergency Medical System and the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely fashion, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis-based strategy may be entertained at non-PCI capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.",

Given the exponential growth of the disease, patients with COVID-19 may overwhelm the emergency department (ED), medical floors, intensive care unit resources, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and medical staff. Thus, healthcare systems are reducing elective procedures and surgeries to prepare for, and manage, infected patients. The United States now has the highest number of documented COVID-19 patients in the world, and it is likely that we will be managing patients with this disease over at least the next 12-18 months.",

However, it is important to emphasize that the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular or structural heart disease may not be infected with COVID-19. Further, as we prepare for the care of patients with COVID-19 related illness, we also need to ensure that the overall patient population continues to benefit from the tremendous advancements in cardiovascular care made over the past 3 decades. 7, 8 The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical to: 1) inform the public that we can minimize exposure to the coronavirus so they continue to call the Emergency Medical System (EMS) for acute ischemic heart disease symptoms and therefore get the appropriate level of cardiac care that their presentation warrants;",

In certain regions, community spread of SARS-CoV2 is prevalent, and the sensitivity of testing is imperfect. Further, patients testing positive for COVID-19 can be asymptomatic despite significant abnormalities noted on chest computed tomography (CT) scan and there appears to be significant risk of asymptomatic transmission of the disease. [9] [10] Therefore, a balance must be struck in identifying appropriate patients for invasive approaches to AMI regardless of their COVID-19 status, and maintaining the safety of healthcare workers who might be exposed to the disease as well as minimizing contamination of cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) facilities. The need for additional patient evaluation might translate into some delays in reperfusion. A small study from Hong Kong examining the care of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated a delay in symptom onset to medical contact times suggesting that there may also be patient and/or or systems-related delays in medical care during this pandemic. 6 In addition, there has been a reduction in STEMI activations, reflecting a reluctance to seek medical attention or misdiagnoses given the focus on respiratory issues. 11 Given this complexity, a reassessment of the current strategies for efficient and effective management of AMI during the COVID-19 pandemic is required. This is addressed with a focus on 1) clinical presentation including STEMI, cardiogenic shock, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and non-STEMI; 2) PPE for health care workers; 3) role of the ED, EMS and CCL; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. We conclude with recommendations that balance the benefits and risks of invasive management of ischemic heart disease, as well as health care team protections, anticipating these recommendations to be relevant during the entire period of the US coronavirus pandemic.",

The focus of this evaluation is two-fold: 1) further risk stratification for COVID-19 status and 2) further evaluation of the diagnosis specifically assessing the potential for coronary thrombotic occlusion versus other pathologies. Either a point of care ultrasound (POCUS) of the heart or a traditional transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation to assess for wall motion abnormality consistent with the electrocardiographic change may provide valuable information. Available clinical, ECG, laboratory and imaging data can inform a decision between the ED physician and interventional cardiologist regarding CCL activation. Coronary CT angiography may be considered in cases where the findings of ST elevation and transthoracic echocardiography are divergent. One clear advantage of an invasive approach to STEMI in the current era is the ability to diagnose a thrombotic coronary occlusion (as opposed to stress cardiomyopathy or myocarditis) before embarking on an early reperfusion approach.

When feasible, bedside placement of MCS or ECMO might decrease the risk of exposure to the CCL or cardiothoracic surgical team. The approach is dependent on local resources and the COVID-19 disease burden in the community. Finally, there are not enough data at this time to state whether advanced support devices for COVID-19 associated cardiovascular pathology will positively impact mortality rates and thus individual patient risk assessment is required. In contrast, patients admitted with an acute coronary syndrome who are felt to be COVID-19 possible, should continue to get standard medical therapy with an early invasive approach as clinically indicated. As rapid testing for COVID-19 becomes more easily available, it should be performed as soon as possible to establish diagnosis, inform risk assessment, and guide placement within the hospital. As the prevalence of COVID-19 remains unknown, we recommend that all medical staff taking care of AMI patients (regardless of COVID-19 positive, probable or possible) should have PPE in place during cardiovascular procedures, regardless of specific location (e.g. ED, CCL, ICU/CCU, hospital ward).",

In addition, the minimum number of personnel should be in the room at the time of intubation/extubation. Given the potential risk of aerosol generation during all emergency AMI procedures, this writing group recommends PPE with aerosolization protection for the entire CCL staff during PCI for all STEMI patients during this COVID-19 pandemic as per the previously published ACC/SCAI guidelines for managing CCL patients during the COVID-19 epidemic 24 .

However, due to the logistical issues and time delays secondary to diagnostic uncertainty of STEMI with COVID-19, direct transport of the patient to the CCL is not felt to be prudent at this time. Therefore, we recommend initial assessment of all STEMI patients in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the correct diagnosis and care plan (Figure 2) .

Based upon these new operational risks and patient comorbidities, it is imperative to consider immediate adjustments that maximize treatment options for patients with acute cardiovascular emergencies while protecting the safety of patients and providers. We propose the following guiding principles for Transfer STEMI Regional Systems of Care in the era of coronavirus (Table II) (Figure 3) . These recommendations will need to be adapted to each regional system's PCI Center, STEMI referral hospitals, and EMS system and need to be communicated clearly between cardiology and emergency medicine providers within each hospital. As the COVID-19 pandemic grows or recedes, this algorithm will need to be updated and adapted but will eventually return to the principles of simplicity and efficiency previously outlined in the STEMI Accelerator program and the ACC/AHA Guidelines 7, 8, 26 . For now, each system must recognize the competing and equally important principles of (A) timely reperfusion of STEMI patients, B) safe regional transport and treatment of potentially high-risk patients and C) additional emphasis on protection and safety of all health care personnel.",

Hence, until additional data are available, COVID-19 positive or probable patients with an NSTEMI presentation should be managed medically and only taken for urgent coronary angiography and possible PCI in the presence of high-risk clinical features (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score >140) 20 or hemodynamic instability.

Patients with classic clinical presentation and ECG finding consistent with a STEMI who are COVID-19 possible should proceed to primary PCI. Ultrarapid COVID-19 testing (if available) helps determine the use of a dedicated CCL and post-procedure hospital unit placement. With any equivocal symptoms or electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, a transthoracic echocardiogram, portable chest x-ray and serial ECGs should help determine the need for invasive coronary angiography. In consultation between the emergency department and interventional cardiology, consideration to coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography or cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) activation can then be made. *Primary PCI should always be performed with universal use of personal protection equipment (PPE) for aerosolized and droplet precautions for the entire CCL team.",
