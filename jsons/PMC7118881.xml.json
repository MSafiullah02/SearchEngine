Respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are frequent causes of acute pharyngitis. Other viral causes of acute pharyngitis include coxsackievirus, echovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Epstein-Barr virus is a frequent cause of acute pharyngitis that is often accompanied by other clinical findings of infectious mononucleosis (eg, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy). Systemic infections with other viral agents, including cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, and measles virus, may be associated with acute pharyngitis.",

Other bacteria also can cause acute pharyngitis, however, including groups C and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a rare cause of acute pharyngitis, particularly in teenagers, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae occasionally can cause acute pharyngitis in sexually active adolescents. Other bacteria, such as Francisella tularensis and Yersinia enterocolitica, and mixed infections with anaerobic bacteria (eg, Vincent's angina) are rare causes of acute pharyngitis. Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been implicated as causes of acute pharyngitis, particularly in adults. Although other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are cultured frequently from the throats of children with acute pharyngitis, their etiologic role in this disease has not been established.",

Group C streptococcus also can cause epidemic food-borne pharyngitis; family and school outbreaks of group C streptococcal pharyngitis related to ingestion of contaminated food products, such as unpasteurized cow's milk, have been described [4]. Although there have been several well-documented food-borne outbreaks of group G streptococcal pharyngitis, the etiologic role of group G streptococcus in acute, endemic pharyngitis is unclear. A community-wide, respiratory outbreak of group G streptococcal pharyngitis in a pediatric population was described in which group G streptococcus was isolated from 56 of 222 (25%) consecutive children with acute pharyngitis seen in a private pediatric office [5]. Results of DNA fingerprinting of the group G streptococcus isolates suggested that 75% of them were the same strain.",

Anaerobic incubation increases the yield of these organisms, but many laboratories do not use anaerobic incubation routinely for throat cultures. In addition, because many groups C and G streptococci are bacitracin resistant, and laboratories may report only bacitracin-sensitive streptococci (consistent with GAS), many groups C and G streptococci would be missed. Finally, many clinicians no longer perform throat cultures, but instead rely solely on rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs), and groups C and G streptococci would not be identified by a RADT for GAS [6].",

It is a diffuse, finely papular, erythematous eruption producing a bright red discoloration of the skin, which blanches on pressure. Involvement is often more intense along the creases of the elbows, axillae, and groin. The involved skin has a goose-pimple appearance and feels rough. The face is usually spared, although the cheeks may be erythematous with pallor around the mouth. After 3 to 4 days, the rash begins to fade and is followed by desquamation, first on the face, progressing downward, and often resembling that seen after a mild sunburn. Occasionally, sheetlike desquamation may occur around the free margins of the fingernails, palms, and soles. Examination of the pharynx of a patient with scarlet fever reveals essentially the same findings as with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. In addition, the tongue usually is coated, and the papillae are swollen. After desquamation, the reddened papillae are prominent, giving the tongue a strawberry appearance.",

The pharyngitis of pharyngoconjunctival fever can persist for 7 days, the conjunctivitis can persist for 14 days, and both resolve spontaneously.

Rapid identification and treatment of patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis can reduce the risk of the spread of GAS, allow the patient to return to school or work sooner, and speed clinical improvement [17], [26].

Most studies that have evaluated the sensitivities of RADTs have compared the performance of a single type of RADT with a standard culture. Because of considerable variability in study designs and culture techniques, it is difficult to compare the sensitivity of a RADT as determined in one study with the sensitivity of another RADT as determined in a different study [28]. The relative sensitivities of different RADTs can be determined only by direct comparisons. There have been to date only four direct comparisons of different RADTs reported in the English literature (one of which was a letter to the editor) [30], [31], [32], [33].

Armengol et al [25] attempted to validate the sensitivity of the specific RADT being used in their practice before abandoning confirmatory throat cultures for negative RADT results [10], [11]. In this study performed over three winter seasons and using the on-site physician office laboratory at the pediatric group practice, they found that the RADT had a sensitivity of approximately 85% compared with a single blood agar plate culture. The investigators concluded that the sensitivity of this particular RADT was too low for them to consider abandoning the confirmatory throat culture in their practice. In contrast, Mayes and Pichichero [36] reviewed the experience with RADTs in a different pediatric group practice between January 1996 and June 1999. During this period, 11,427 RADTs were performed, and 8385 (73.4%) were negative. A confirmatory blood agar plate culture was performed for 8234 (98.2%) of these 8385 negative tests. Of these, 200 (2.4%) were determined to have been negative RADT results with a positive throat culture. A cost analysis showed that elimination of confirmatory throat cultures for negative RADT results could produce substantial saving to a practice and to patients. The investigators concluded that culture confirmation of negative RADT results may not be necessary in all circumstances [36].",

When selecting an antimicrobial for the treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, it is important to consider efficacy, safety, antimicrobial spectrum (narrow versus broad), dosing schedules, compliance, and cost. Based on such considerations, several advisory bodies recommend penicillin as the treatment of choice for this infection [9], [10], [11]. Although the problem of increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacteria is one of the most important current infectious disease issues, GAS has never developed resistance to any of the penicillins or cephalosporins or shown any increase in penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations over at least 5 decades [41]. Amoxicillin often is used in place of oral penicillin V in young children; the efficacy appears equal. This choice is related primarily to acceptance of the taste of amoxicillin suspension. Orally administered erythromycin is indicated for patients allergic to penicillin. Other macrolides, such as clarithromycin or azithromycin, also are effective. First-generation cephalosporins also are acceptable in penicillin-allergic patients who do not manifest immediate-type hypersensitivity to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.",

In an investigation of antibiotic resistance patterns of 245 pharyngeal isolates and 56 invasive isolates of GAS obtained between 1994 and 1997 from 24 states and the District of Columbia, only 8 (2.6%) of the 301 isolates were determined to be macrolide resistant [41].

Nine percent of pharyngeal and 32% of invasive GAS strains collected in San Francisco during 1994\u20131995 were reported to be macrolide resistant [51]. Martin et al [52], during a longitudinal investigation of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal disease in a single elementary school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, found that 48% of the isolates of GAS collected between October 2000 and May 2001 were resistant to erythromycin. None were resistant to clindamycin. Molecular typing indicated that this outbreak was due to a single strain of GAS. In addition, of 100 randomly selected isolates of GAS obtained from the community between April and June 2001, 38 (38%) were resistant to erythromycin [52].",

Such a patient is likely to be a GAS carrier if (1) the clinical and epidemiologic findings suggest a viral etiology, (2) there is little clinical response to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, (3) throat cultures (or RADTs) are also positive between episodes of pharyngitis, and (4) there is no serologic response to GAS extracellular antigen (eg, antistreptolysin O, anti-DNase B).",

When it has been determined that the patient is experiencing repeated episodes of bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, some have suggested prophylactic oral penicillin V. The efficacy of this regimen has never been proved, however, and antimicrobial prophylaxis is not recommended except to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever in patients who have experienced a previous episode of rheumatic fever. Tonsillectomy may be considered in a rare patient whose symptomatic episodes do not diminish in frequency over time and in whom no alternative explanation for the recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is evident. Tonsillectomy has been shown to be beneficial for a relatively small group of these patients, however, and any benefit can be expected to be relatively short-lived [57], [58], [59].",
