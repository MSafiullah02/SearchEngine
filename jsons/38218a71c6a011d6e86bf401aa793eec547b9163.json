The written informed consent of a parent or legal guardian was required, and children older than 8 years were asked to give their assent. All of the otherwise healthy children aged between 1 month and 14 years seen in our Emergency Room because of fever and signs and symptoms of lower respiratory tract involvement whose chest radiograph was consistent with CAP were considered eligible for the study. The chest radiographs were evaluated by an independent expert radiologist who classified the findings as alveolar, interstitial, or no pneumonia in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. 4 Upon admission, respiratory secretions were taken from each child using a pernasal flocked swab and stored in a tube of UTM-RT (Kit Cat. No. 360c, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy). Viral tests for the identification of influenza viruses were performed for study purposes and were always available after the patient's discharge. Upon enrollment, detailed information regarding the patients' demographics, clinical history, and disease characteristics was collected, together with a blood sample for the evaluation of laboratory variables including white blood cell (WBC) counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels, and blood cultures. First drug treatment as well as decision on when to hospitalize was chosen by attending pediatrician in charge on the basis of the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics. 5 None of the children was treated with antivirals. All of the enrolled children (whether they were hospitalized or sent home immediately after enrollment) were reevaluated 15 AE 2 days later by means of interviews and clinical examinations carried out by trained investigators using standardized questionnaires.",

One segment was amplified using two published primers. 8 The sequences identified in this study, together with previously published 7, 9, 10 representative sequences of each lineage downloaded from the GenBank database, were aligned using ClustalX v.2.0.12 11 and default parameters.

The collected data seem to indicate that ICV can be considered a possible cause of CAP in children, particularly in younger subjects. Our results also suggest the need for further prospective studies that should be carried out throughout the year to provide conclusive results. Previous studies have shown that ICV infection in temperate zones does not have the marked seasonal nature of IAV or IBV infections as it has been in patients with respiratory infections during winter (concomitantly with other influenza viruses) as well as during late spring and early summer. 1 It is therefore possible that the global importance of ICV as a cause of CAP in children is greater than that found in our study, which only involved the winter months.",

Data collected in France from 2004 to 2007 10 and in Spain in 2009-20103 indicate that strains belonging to the same lineages as those found in this study were co-circulating there immediately before or simultaneously with those identified in Italy. Moreover, four of the five ICVs identified in this study had 99% nucleotidic identity with strains first identified in France 10 and Spain.3 This confirms that spontaneous variations in the amino acid sequences of circulating ICV strains occur slowly and that continuous virological surveillance of ICV may contribute to improving our knowledge of the importance of the different strains in causing disease.",
