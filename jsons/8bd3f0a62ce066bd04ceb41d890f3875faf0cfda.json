These include bond percolation, site percolation, k-core percolation, bootstrap percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts threshold model (WTM). We show that-except for bond percolation-each of these processes arises as a special case of the WTM, and bond percolation arises from a small modification. In fact \"heterogeneous k-core percolation,\" a corresponding \"heterogeneous bootstrap percolation\" model, and the generalized epidemic process are completely equivalent to one another and the WTM. We further show that a natural generalization of the WTM in which individuals \"transmit\" or \"send a message\" to their neighbors with some probability less than 1 can be reformulated in terms of the WTM, and so this apparent generalization is in fact not more general. Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these results is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these other models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular case may in fact apply much more generally.",

Percolation comes in many flavors, and the information we gain depends on which variety we choose. Most frequently, we study bond or site percolation, but researchers have also found that k-core percolation, bootstrap percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts threshold model (WTM) provide valuable insights [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . These processes are closely related, and indeed similar mathematical approaches have been used to study several of these processes [7, 8] . Our main result is that all of these (and some related) processes can be derived as special cases of the WTM, and in fact several of these are completely equivalent to the WTM.",

If we consider systems in which nodes change status in response to the status of their neighbors, and the potential path of statuses they can have is acyclic (that is, they can never return to a previous status), then many variants of percolation can be applied. This is commonly used for susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) disease, in which an individual can be infected by an infected neighbor. However, much recent work has focused on the spread of \"social contagion\" or \"complex contagions\" [9, 10] in which multiple transmissions may be required in order to cause \"infection.\" Sometimes this is presented as assigning each node a threshold r u such that u becomes infected once r u neighbors are \"infected.\" Other times this is presented as a reduction (or increase) in the probability that a neighbor will transmit as an individual encounters more infected individuals. This models the idea that after hearing seemingly independent \"confirmation\" of a rumor, people may be more likely to believe and spread it, or after seeing multiple people engaging in buying a product, someone is more likely to perceive a consensus and buy the product as well. Some experimental evidence of this has been found [11, 12] .",

Typically our interest is in identifying the nodes in the connected components of the residual network, and whether a \"giant\" component exists (that is, a component whose size is proportional to the network size in the infinite network limit).",

There is an exact equivalence between the spread of an SIR disease and bond percolation, and so much has been learned about the threshold, scaling properties, and dynamics of an SIR disease by studying the corresponding percolation model. This percolation equivalence is based on the fact that an edge either exists or does not in percolation, while in disease spread if the edge transmits, the receiving node becomes infected.",

This \"pruning\" process repeats until a state is reached in which all nodes have degree at least k. This remaining network is called the \"k-core\" of the network. It is seen to have hybrid phase transitions, with a square-root-type scaling on one side of a transition followed by a discontinuous jump [4, 25] . In a variant, \"heterogeneous k-core\" percolation [26] , each node is assigned its own threshold value and deleted if its degree goes below the threshold. We note that many authors have used the term \"bootstrap percolation\" to denote k-core percolation, and indeed this appears to be the original term [1, 3, 4] , but we reserve \"bootstrap percolation\" for a closely related dual process. The k-core has been applied to many problems, including understanding the failure of a physical system under strain [27] , network visualization [28] , identification of the component of a network responsible for establishing a disease [29] , and more generally for understanding the structure of a network [30] .",

It has received considerable study on lattices [31, 32] , and its behavior in large random networks has been the subject of some more recent analysis [33] .

If it escapes infection but a second neighbor becomes infected, then its probability of becoming infected is p 2 . This repeats and the probability of successful transmission on the mth neighbor's infection is p m . If p m = p for all m, then this is the network version of the classical Reed-Frost model [35] for a susceptible-infected-recovered disease [36] . If p m decreases as m increases, this could model decreasing susceptibility due to an improved immune response as exposures accumulate, or it could simply represent preexisting heterogeneities in susceptibility that are revealed as the number of exposures increases. An increasing p m would model some synergistic or cumulative effect of exposures as seen in \"complex contagions\" [9] .

The probability that node u has a given r is given by P (r u = r|d u ) = q(r|d u ). A node begins as either active or inactive. If an inactive node u has at least r u active neighbors, then it becomes active. We assume that the initially active nodes may be chosen independently at random [which can be modeled by having q(r|d) > 0 for some r 0], or they may be chosen by some other rule, in which case we treat the set of initially active nodes as an input to the algorithm. Often a common threshold r * is chosen so P (r u = r * ) = 1 or a common fraction \u03c1 * is chosen so P (r u = \u03c1 * d u |d u ) = 1. As described above, this is frequently used to model social contagions. In [6] it was conjectured that for a global cascade to occur from an infinitesimally small initial proportion active, a giant component of nodes with r = 1 would need to exist. This is true in random configuration model networks, but false in random clustered networks [8] . As with bootstrap and k-core percolation, this is known to exhibit hybrid bifurcations [8] .",
