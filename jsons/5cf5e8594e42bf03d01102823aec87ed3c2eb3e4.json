TMEV and myelin can interrelate during virus entry and persistence. On virus entry, TMEV might use peripheral myelin Po protein as a virus receptor. For persistence, TMEV seems to require myelin functional proteins or structural myelin itself. Here, myelin and oligodendrocyte loss and downregulation of myelin genes would lead to demyelination, but might limit virus spread in the central nervous system. Unlike experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a pathogenic role of anti-myelin autoimmunity is unclear in TMEV infection. Anti-myelin autoantibodies have been detected in TMEV infection. Among them, only anti-galactocerebroside (GC) antibody is shown to be myelinotoxic, and has molecular mimicry with TMEV. Myelin-specific T cells play no role in initiation or progression of demyelination in the first two to three months after TMEV infection. However, cellular autoimmunity against several myelin antigens (epitope spreading) can be detected during the late chronic stage.",

We will next discuss possible roles of anti-myelin immunity including molecular mimicry and epitope spreading in the pathogenesis of demyelination. Finally, we will introduce two unique model systems using TMEV infection (i) to study the pathogenic role(s) of molecular mimicry and (ii) to explore potential therapeutic agents, remyelination-promoting autoantibodies, in demyelinating diseases. An understanding of the diverse interactions between viruses, myelin and host immune responses to neuroantigens may shed light on the etiology and pathogenesis of MS.",

Several picornaviruses, such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus, can cause neurological disease in humans (8) . However, TMEV infects mice and rats in vivo and causes a demyelinating disease only in mice.

There are two major hypotheses: (i) direct virus infection of myelin forming cells, i.e. oligodendrocytes, and (ii) immune-mediated mechanisms. Infection with live TMEV is necessary to induce demyelination, since neither ultraviolet-inactivated TMEV nor cDNAs encoding individual TMEV capsid proteins alone cause demyelination (18) . Virtually all immune cells, including T cells, B cells and macrophages, have been shown to play important roles [reviewed in (1) (2) (3) (4) ]. In contrast to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (3) and other virus-induced demyelinating diseases (19) , adoptive transfer of uninfected immune cells from TMEVinfected mice does not induce demyelination in the recipient mice (20) . In addition, acquired immunity is neither necessary, nor sufficient in some TMEV model systems; TMEV can persistently infect the CNS and induce demyelination in: major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-deficient mice (21, 22) , MHC class II-deficient mice (23), CD4-deficient mice (24) , or CD8-deficient mice (24) . TMEV also causes demyelination in the spinal cord of moth-eaten mice, lacking protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, as early as five days p.i., when no acquired immune responses are normally generated (25) .",

In order to cause CNS infection by this route, the virus must get from the alimentary tract into the CNS, either hematogenously or intra-axonally. Since the strains of the TO subgroup of TMEV could be isolated from feces up to 154 days p.i. (28) , invasion into the CNS via the neural route from a persistent infection in the intestine may be one pathway, as originally suggested by Theiler and Gard (27) . Myelin is a multiple lamellar membrane that sheathes axons and facilitates the saltatory conduction of nerve impulses. P0 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily, and constitutes 50% of the total myelin proteins present in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Using virus overlay and virus binding assays, Libbey et al (29) identified P0 protein as a potential receptor for TMEV (Table 1) . They suggested that the use of the P0 protein in Schwann cells as a receptor may be one mechanism by which TMEV spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the CNS in vivo. In the CNS, TMEV receptors on neurons during the acute phase and on glial cells and macrophages during the chronic phase have not been identified.",

Bihl et al (30) demonstrated that myelin gene mutation could affect the persistence of TMEV. Susceptibility/resistance to chronic TMEV infection has been mapped to several loci including one tentatively located in the telomeric region of chromosome 18, close to the myelin basic protein locus (Mbp locus) (31, 32) . To determine if the Mbp gene influences viral persistence, Bihl et al (30) inoculated DA virus into C3H mice bearing the shiverer (shi) mutation, a 20-kb deletion in the gene. Whereas TMEV-infected wild-type C3H +/+ mice had intermediate levels of virus persistence on days 20 and 45 p.i., an increase in viral persistence was detected in heterozygous C3H +/shi mice, and no virus persistence was detected in homozygous C3H shi/shi mice. The increased susceptibility of the heterozygous shiverer mice was also seen in (C57BL/6 x C3H +/shi) F1 mice (1), although C57BL/6 mice are resistant to TMEV persistence. Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected 20 days after DA virus infection of C3H/101H mice homozygous for a point mutation in the gene coding for PLP (PLP1, previously PLP), the rumpshaker (rsh/rsh) mutation (no data was available in control C3H/101H (+/+) mice, though) (30) . In these studies, infection of oligodendrocytes, the presence of demyelination and anti-TMEV immune responses were not tested. The number of oligodendrocytes has been reported to be normal, or even slightly increased in uninfected shiverer and rumpshaker mutant mice, although the myelin is grossly deficient. Therefore, these results suggest that TMEV persistence is linked to myelin and functional alteration, for example, may change the virus's ability to replicate in, or traffic through, the myelin sheath. Although the MBP gene or some other MBP-linked locus has been suggested to influence susceptibility to MS, other studies have not demonstrated linkage between MS and the MBP gene (33,34).",

At four weeks p.i., decreased levels of MBP and PLP mRNAs were associated with the presence of viral RNA and demyelination. By 8 or 12 weeks p.i., however, extensive demyelination was associated with a significant decrease of MBP and PLP mRNAs but not with the presence of viral RNA. These results indicate that a viral infection of white matter in the early phase of TMEV infection leads to demyelination, but that, later in the course of disease, some other mechanism, such as an immunopathologic process, drives extensive demyelination.",

The latter possibility is supported by the fact that some viruses are known to alter the \"luxury\" or differentiated function of a cell, without disturbance of its vital function, i.e., ability to survive (40) . Using electron microscopy, Rodriguez (15) demonstrated degenerative changes in the most distal processes of oligodendrocytes in TMEV infection.

Demyelinating diseases might represent the oligodendrocytes' futile attempt to suppress viral replication, which ultimately results in potentially irreversible myelin damage.

In addition, professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) could exploit soluble anti-myelin antibody for antigen capture by Fc receptor mediated uptake of myelin-containing immune complexes. This would lead to augmentation of myelin-specific T cell responses, and also might contribute to determinant spreading (see a later section) in TMEV infection, as suggested for other autoimmune diseases (52) . The potential beneficial role of anti-neuroantigen antibodies will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.",

When injected intravenously into mice with EAE, mAb H8 increased demyelinating lesions within the spinal cord by ten-fold (56) . To determine whether antibodies similar to mAb H8 exist during viral infection, mice were infected with TMEV and sera were collected at various times after infection.

Passive administration of mAb H7 resulted in the clearance of virus and survival of athymic mice. Both H7 and H8 antibodies can neutralize TMEV, yet only H8 is myelinotoxic (Table 2 ). Further investigation is needed to clarify which immunologic factors, such as T helper cells, favors generation of each type of anti-VP1 antibody in vivo. The presence of \"myelinotoxic activity\" has been demonstrated in the CSF and sera in demyelinating diseases; only GC and MOG are identified as target molecules of demyelinating antibodies of which passive transfer exacerbates, but not initiates, demyelination in the CNS in vivo (58) . Anti-GC antibody has also been detected in some MS patients (59). (60)]. Epitope spreading can play an active role in the relapse or progression of autoimmune diseases, as was first suggested in EAE by Lehmann et al (61) . After initial immune-mediated tissue destruction, tissue debris is taken up by macrophages, dendritic cells or B cells, and presented to tissue-specific T cells. Spreading of the specificity of an immune response can be from one epitope to another on the same molecule (intramolecular epitope spreading, for example, from PLP139-151 to or from an epitope on one molecule to one on a different molecule (intermolecular epitope spreading, for example, from PLP139-151 to MOG92_I06) (60) .",

EAE is induced by subcutaneous injection of myelin antigens emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), while emulsification with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) can induce anergy to myelin antigens, rendering resistance to subsequent EAE induction. Following MBP or SCH emulsified in IFA injection, Lang et al (65) injected mice with DA virus or SCH/CFA for EAE induction. They found that pretreatment with myelin antigens/IFA suppressed EAE induction, but not TMEV-induced demyelination at 45 days p.i. Another protocol for neuroantigens-specific tolerance induction that can suppress EAE also failed to alter the development of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease on day 65 p.i. (64) . Similarly, using a treatment regimen reported to suppress EAE, Drescher et al (66) demonstrated that oral tolerization with myelin did not alter TMEV-induced demyelination at day 45 p.i., supporting a non-autoimmune mechanism of TMEV-induced demyelination. Although TMEV-infected mice develop demyelinating disease one month after infection and disease progresses continuously from then on, myelin-specific cellular immunity contributes to neither initiation nor progression of demyelinating disease at least for the first two to three months after TMEV infection.",

While most studies on TMEV-induced demyelination have used mice infected with TMEV for one to two months p.i., the Miller group has examined the role of epitope spreading in initiating anti-myelin autoimmune responses in SJL/J mice during the late chronic phase of disease, more than two to three months after BeAn strain of TMEV infection (60) . As reviewed in the previous section, before three months p.i., TMEVinfected mice develop CD4 + T cells specific for TMEV, but not for neuroantigens. However, the Miller group demonstrated PLP139.~st-specific T cell proliferation in TMEV-infected mice 87 days, but not 33 days, after infection, and DTH response to PLP139-151 was first demonstrable at day 52 (67) . Peripheral T-cell responses to myelin epitopes develop during progressive disease in a hierarchical order, beginning with the dominant PLP139-151 peptide, but only after the onset of demyelination. As disease progresses, responses to various other less-dominant encephalitogenic myelin epitopes, such as PLP178-191, PLP56-70 and MOG92.106 develop. Although there are some inconsistencies as to the onset date of the antineuroantigen specific immune response between the reports by Miller's group, overt anti-myelin immune responses seem to be detectable around three months after TMEV infection, which argues against these responses contributing to myelin damage before this time.",

Macrophages and microglia harvested from the CNS during the early chronic phase, 40-42 days after TMEV infection, presented viral peptides, but not myelin peptide (68) . However, by 90 days post-infection, CNS APCs presented both viral and myelin epitopes to Thl and Th2 cell lines and hybridomas specific for TMEV or PLP peptides in the absence of exogenous antigen in vitro, indicating these APCs could endogenously process and present both viral and myelin antigens (68, 69) . Importantly, anti-CD86 (B7-2) antibody predominantly inhibited PLPm.asl-specific T cell proliferation mediated by endogenous antigen presentation by CNS APCs from TMEVinfected mice (72% inhibition), compared with anti-CD80 (B7-1) (44% inhibition). This is in contrast to CD80 predominance in SJL/J mice with RR-EAE. Therefore, the costimulatory dependence of epitope spreading differs between TMEV infection and RR-EAE. In vivo costimulatory blockade of CD28 (ligand for CD80 and 86) on days 0, 2, 4, 6 and 9 after TMEV infection inhibited anti-TMEV immune responses and increased virus persistence, accelerating epitope spreading (70) . This CD28 blocking would have been more intriguing, if it had been administered in TMEVinfected mice during the early chronic phase, possibly during the priming period of anti-PLP responses, where the treatment could inhibit epitope spreading without suppression of anti-TMEV immunity.",

Paradoxically, PLP139.151-specific splenic T cell proliferative and interferon (IFN)-7 responses were enhanced in the MP4-treated mice, while PLPm.~51-specific DTH responses were downregulated. In addition, after 120-140 days p.i., MP4-treated mice showed disease severity comparable to control animals. These results indicated that MP4-treatement in TMEV infection did neither induce tolerance via deletion or anergy, nor immune deviation from Thl to Th2 responses. In contrast, the MP4 treatment completely inhibited both the acute attack and relapse of PLP-and MBP-induced EAE with significant suppression of PLP-and MBP-specific lymphoproliferative responses (72) . Administration of MP4 also markedly ameliorates the course of established EAE. These results suggest that the immunological parameters of epitope spreading differ between TMEV infection and EAE.",

There was no correlation between clinical score and the strength of the DTH response to myelin autoantigens in mice tested at 36-48 weeks. Therefore, the authors concluded that anti-myelin autoimmunity might be an additional factor that contributes to lesion progression during the late chronic stage, although autoimmunity to myelin might represent only an epiphenomena, being induced only after damage to myelin produced by other mechanisms.",

Epitope spreading might simply reflect release of autoantigens secondary to myelin destruction, and may not have pathogenic significance. However, Dal Canto et al (77) showed that lymph node cells harvested from mice 70 days after TMEV infection produced demyelination in organotypic cultures after stimulation with PLP139-152 but not after stimulation with whole MBP. The authors suggested that antigen spreading to PLP, but not to MBP, might play an important role in demyelination. It would be intriguing to test whether adoptive transfer of the PLP peptide-stimulated lymphocytes from TMEV-infected mice could cause demyelination in na'fve mice in vivo, while possible contamination with live transferred virus in cultures and the effect of whole PLP or MBP peptide stimulation of lymph node cells should also be addressed in future experiments. On the other hand, autoimmunity in the CNS, including MBPspecific T cells, has been demonstrated to have a protective or beneficial nature under certain circumstances (78) . Therefore, one cannot rule out the possibility that anti-myelin autoimmunity might play a neuroprotective role during the late chronic phase of TMEV infection, a time when severe axonal injury and loss has been demonstrated [reviewed in (5) ].",

Infection with the PLP139_151-encoding TMEV (PLP139-BeAn) led to rapid-onset of paralytic disease within ten days. As early as 14 days p.i., inflammatory demyelinating lesions were detected in the spinal cord, and PLP139_ls~-specific T cell proliferation and DTH response were detected in the spleen. Similar early-onset disease with anti-PLP responses was also observed in mice infected with a TMEV encoding altered peptide ligand (APL) of PLP139-151 with an amino acid substitution at the T cell receptor contact residue (H147A PLP139-BeAn). PLP139.151-specific T cells, but not TMEV-specific T cells, from PLP139-BeAn-infected mice transferred demyelinating disease to na'fve recipients, and induction of PLP~B9.15~-specific tolerance before infection prevented clinical disease (80) . The authors suggest that both PLP139-BeAn and H147A PLPI39-BeAn viruses induced PLP specific T cells, leading to early onset of demyelinating disease. No information is available about pathology and viral replication one week after PLP139-BeAn virus infection.

In the EAE model, injection of a myelin component with IFA ameliorates clinical and pathological demyelinating disease. This therapeutic effect could be due to: 1) suppression of Th I cell-mediated autoimmunity and 2) production of antimyelin antibody that plays a direct role in remyelination. This latter role is in agreement with in vitro observations of antibody-mediated oligodendrocyte stimulation. Based on the initial observations by Traugott et al (85) of remyelination in EAE, Lang et al (86) conducted similar experiments with mice infected with the DA strain of TMEV. At three months p.i., mice treated with subcutaneous injections of MBP and GC emulsified in IFA showed substantial CNS remyelination compared with control treated animals. In the following paper, however, they demonstrated that pretreatment of mice with SCH/IFA or MBP/IFA did not suppress clinical and histological disease in TMEV infection (65) .",

Neither IVIg nor human IgM bound to human oligodendrocytes in vitro, while the two IgM mAbs bound to oligodendrocytes. Polyclonal human IgM and sHIgM22, but neither polyclonal IgG, anti-SCH IgG, nor IVIg, accelerated the rate of remyelination following lysolecithin-induced demyelination in SJL/J mice (99, 102) .

It is unclear whether there is one single common mechanism which explains promotion of remyelination in all remyelination-promoting sera, IgG, and IgM antibodies. Because many of the remyelinationpromoting antibodies bind to oligodendrocytes and/or myelin, a direct effect on the recognized cells has been hypothesized. However, since the remyelination-promoting autoantibodies have varying specificities, it is unlikely that each of the antibodies functions directly through a common antigen or receptor. The authors also suggested opsonization of myelin debris due to IgM antibody by phagocytes might enhance clearance of cellular debris from the damaged area, allowing the normal process of CNS repair to progress. Since Fc receptors on phagocytes do not generally bind to the Fc portion of IgM, IgM likely interacts with C3b via its C~tl domain, thereby allowing antibody-antigen complexes containing IgM to indirectly mediate phagocytosis. Although by this mechanism, C3b, once fixed, can promote uptake via complement receptors on macrophages, the roles of complement and Fc receptor have not been tested in this model. Immunomodulation by autoantibody is also hypothesized. However, no data are available as to how autoantibody treatment might influence cellular immune responses to virus or myelin antigen.",

It should be noted that most remyelination-promoting studies used mice four to six months after TMEV infection, in contrast to the other TMEV research groups who use mice one to two months after TMEV infection. As discussed earlier, the mechanisms of demyelination might be different at these two time points.",

Natural autoantibodies, usually IgMs whose physiological significance is unknown, are present in the serum of normal unimmunized animal, and represent a substantial fraction of the total Ig repertoire (104) . Natural autoantibodies show polyreactivity toward multiple self and nonself antigens, and are typically encoded by unmutated germ line Ig genes (103) . It has been shown that some viruses may act as polyclonal B cell activators, may release antigens not ordinarily recognized by the host immune system, or may augment the response to many antigens (105, 106) .

            "text": "In this chapter, we have reviewed the interactions of TMEV, myelin and anti-myelin immune responses. On virus entry, TMEV might use peripheral myelin protein P0 as a virus receptor, and require myelin genes functionally or myelin itself structurally for virus persistence. In turn, the host downregulates myelin gene expression and/or loses oligodendrocytes and myelin. While this leads to demyelination, it might also be beneficial to the host since it prevents virus spread in the CNS. Anti-TMEV humoral immune responses can help virus clearance, while some anti-viral antibodies might cross-react with host myelin molecules, including GC, leading to exacerbation of demyelination. During the early chronic phase, cellular immune responses to TMEV, but not to myelin, were detected. However, epitope spreading seems to develop during the late chronic phase, and T cell responses to encephalitogenic epitopes of PLP, MBP and MOG, can be detected. Impaired remyelination could also contribute to disease progression. Here, the presence or absence of remyelination-promoting antibody might be important in disease remission. Of all the above interactions between virus, myelin, and autoimmune responses, no single mechanism may be solely responsible for demyelination. However, all of the interactions potentially contribute to progression of demyelinating disease in which a variety of different pathogenic mechanisms, such as oligodendrocyte infection and apoptosis, axonal injury and anti-TMEV immune responses, seem to act in parallel or sequence to cause myelin destruction ( Figure 1 ).",
