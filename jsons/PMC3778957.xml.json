This infiltration is critically dependent on adhesion molecules expressed on both the migrating cells and the endothelium lining the blood vessels at the site of injury.1,2 After transmigration, monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which play key roles in promoting beneficial inflammation and participate in the healing process by clearing the necrotic tissue,3,4 facilitating angiogenesis,5 promoting myofibroblast formation, collagen deposition, and healing of the infarcted myocardium.6 The critical role of myeloid cells in post-MI healing is illustrated by studies in which systemic depletion of various populations led to markedly impaired wound healing and increased adverse cardiac remodelling.5,7\u20139 Conversely, other studies support a negative role for myeloid cells where their abrogation results in improved outcomes.10\u201312 The current belief is that a precise balance among these cells and the regulatory factors they produce are necessary to orchestrate optimal healing.13\u201315",

We have shown that global CD13 knockout (CD13KO) mice are healthy and fertile and have normal haematopoietic profiles and myeloid cell functions.20 Recently, research from our laboratory has demonstrated that CD13 is also a homotypic adhesion molecule, where cross-linking of monocytic CD13 with activating monoclonal antibodies significantly induces adhesion to CD13 expressed on activated endothelial cells18,21 forming a complex containing both monocytic and endothelial CD13. This homotypic adhesion is independent of CD13 enzymatic activity, but requires tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Cross-linking also induces CD13 clustering and redistribution to the sites of monocyte\u2013endothelial cell contacts.18 However, the role of CD13 as an inflammatory adhesion molecule in vivo is unclear.",

In addition, CD13 may impact the response in its capacity as an angiogenic regulator.23 To address these possibilities, we subjected global CD13KO mice20 to permanent ligation of the left coronary artery and assessed heart function and infarct pathology.

We found that CD13 is expressed on some but not all CD31+ vessels of the infarct area/border zone (Figure 1D1). F4/80-positive macrophages are highly CD13 positive, as are many CD11c+ DCs, as previously established (Figure 1D2,3). In contrast, CD3+ T cells and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA)-positive myofibroblasts distinctly did not express CD13 (Figure 1D4,5). Interestingly, some of the CD13+ cells appear to be intercalated among the myofibroblasts, perhaps indicating a functional interaction. To confirm that these are closely apposed but distinct cell types, we purified RNA from isolated cardiac fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts with TGF-\u03b2. While \u03b1SMA transcripts are readily detectable from both control and differentiated cells by RT\u2013PCR, they are clearly negative for CD13 (Figure 1E). Therefore, CD13 is highly expressed on a number of cell types in the infarct border zone, prompting us to further investigate its role in wound healing after MI.",

Importantly, sham echocardiographic measurements revealed no functional differences between genotypes (not shown). Infarct sizes were also similar at 24 h and 7 days post-MI ruling out the effects of CD13 on acute myocyte death (Figure 2A and B and Supplementary material online, Figure S1). However, at 7 days post-MI, the CD13KO mice showed a marked reduction in fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction, an increase in the left ventricular internal dimension, and a significant thinning of the left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) consistent with adverse remodelling26 (Figure 2C, representative echocardiography images, see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Comparable heart weight (HW) with body weight (BW) ratios ruled out any difference in cardiac hypertrophy as a contributing factor (Table 1). Importantly, reductions in FS and ejection fraction persisted at 2 months after MI (Figure 2C). Further analysis of intact infarcted hearts using the ex vivo working heart model at 7 days following MI corroborated our echocardiography data, where CD13KO mice showed decreases in cardiac output, left ventricular developed pressure, and the rate of left ventricular contraction pressure when compared with CD13WT mice (Figure 2D). Taken together, these functional results are consistent with a protective role for CD13 in wound healing after MI, and the lack of CD13 can result in long-term functional impairment of the heart.\n",

            "text": "The process of healing following MI involves inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodelling. During inflammation, adhesion molecules mediate the transmigration of functionally distinct subsets of monocytes through the blood vessels into the injured tissue, which subsequently differentiate into macrophages and DCs. These cells are responsible for orchestrating subsequent wound healing27 by clearing the necrotic tissue,4,5,28 facilitating angiogenesis5 and myofibroblast production.6,29,30 We have previously shown that in vitro, CD13 functions as a homotypic adhesion molecule that mediates the monocyte\u2013endothelial cell interactions critical for inflammatory trafficking.18 To address whether CD13 might also regulate these interactions in vivo, we evaluated inflammatory cell trafficking in infarcted hearts of WT and CD13KO animals. Flow cytometric analysis of cells isolated from the infarct regions showed a nearly 70% decrease in the numbers of CD45+ haematopoietic cells entering the CD13KO infarct with concomitant decreases in the numbers of CD11b + Gr-1high inflammatory monocytes, CD11b + Gr-1low reparative monocytes, F4/80+ macrophages, CD11c+ DCs, and CD3+ T cells at 7 days post-MI (Figure 3A). Quantitation of immunostained tissue sections corroborated the macrophage (Figure 3B) and T cell (Figure 3C) data. To confirm the striking degree of DC infiltration, we permanently ligated hearts from WT transgenic mice harbouring the gene encoding the mCherry fluorescent protein under the control of the CD11c promoter.31 While the remote heart is largely negative; we observed a remarkable increase in cells displaying cytoplasmic mCherry expression in the infarct border zone in agreement with our quantitative flow cytometric data (Figure 3D). Staining of infarct sections for apoptotic cell markers ruled out the possibility that the lower cell numbers were due to increased apoptosis in the absence of CD13 (Figure 3E). Finally, our previous analysis of CD13KO animals had shown essentially normal haematopoietic development, including macrophage and DC differentiation, arguing against defective development/differentiation in the absence of CD13.19,20 Therefore, the lack of CD13 impairs inflammatory cell trafficking.\n",

Similarly, analysis of stimulated myocyte contraction showed that cells from both genotypes behave similarly, suggesting that the lack of CD13 does not impair individual cardiomyocyte function (Figure 4B, representative tracings Figure 4C). Following MI, macrophages produce TGF-\u03b2 that induces cardiac fibroblasts to differentiate to \u03b1SMA-expressing myofibroblasts, which in turn synthesize and deposit collagen to provide tensile strength to the heart tissue and form a stable scar.2 The adverse remodelling in CD13KO mice would also be consistent with an impaired myofibroblast response. Immunohistochemical staining of 7 days post-MI heart sections indicated that there were significantly fewer \u03b1SMA-expressing myofibroblasts in the infarct region of CD13KO mice (Figure 4D). Masson's trichrome staining showed decreases in large collagen fibres in the CD13KO infarct (Figure 4E, bluish-grey area). Finally, qRT\u2013PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from WT and CD13KO hearts showed reduced levels of TGF-\u03b2 transcripts (Figure 4F), consistent with fewer macrophages in the wound. Since cardiac myofibroblasts do not express CD13 (Figure 1), the decrease in myofibroblast numbers and any subsequent effects on extracellular matrix degradation or deposition is likely the result of other CD13-dependent effects in the healing heart.\n",

We have previously shown that CD13 is an angiogenic regulator,23,32 and thus, the lack of CD13 may also affect angiogenesis and subsequent heart repair. Surprisingly, analysis of heart sections for CD31-positive endothelial-lined lumens showed that, at 7 days post-MI, CD13KO animals have significantly higher numbers of these structures when compared with WT hearts (Figure 5A), which were no longer evident at the longer 2-month post-MI time-point (not shown), consistent with normal vessel regression during healing.33 However, many of the lumens in the CD13KO hearts were quite small and accounted for differences in vessel numbers (Figure 5A). These small vessels were apparently not perfused since CD13KO infarcted hearts excluded methylene blue dye to the same extent as WT infarcts (Figure 5B). To confirm this notion, we perfused WT and CD13KO infarcted hearts with FITC-labeled IB4-lectin to detect patent vessels and counterstained sectioned tissue with Dylight-594-conjugated IB4-lectin to identify total blood vessels. Fluorescence quantitation indicated that there was no significant difference in the perfused green area between genotypes (Figure 5C), suggesting that in vivo vessel function is not affected by the lack of CD13. However, in agreement with our previous findings, in vitro assessment of endothelial morphogenesis using primary lung endothelial cells confirmed that cells from CD13KO mice are severely impaired in their ability to form capillary networks (Figure 5D), suggesting that compensatory mechanisms support angiogenesis in vivo.\n",

While induction of CD13 expression has previously been reported,22 the specific cell-type-expressing CD13 or its functional role in the injured/healing myocardium has not been investigated. In the current study, we find that the pattern of CD13 immunostaining is consistent with its expression on both infiltrating myeloid cells and blood vessels in the infarct area and border zone. In addition, a large proportion of the CD13 expression in the injured tissue appears to belong to a remarkably abundant population of infiltrating DCs. Functional evaluation of hearts following infarction shows that CD13 plays a protective role in cardiac repair as the hearts of mice lacking CD13 show both acute and sustained functional impairment accompanied by significant decreases in inflammatory and reparative monocyte, macrophage, DC, and \u03b1SMA-positive myofibroblast populations and left ventricular dilatation, but apparently no overall effect on angiogenesis or individual cardiac myocyte function. Thus, abnormal trafficking is the likely mechanism responsible for adverse remodelling after MI in CD13KO hearts. The multifunctional nature of this molecule and its expression on a number of cell types that are critical to the healing process suggest that CD13 may regulate multiple aspects of immune and cardiac cell function following acute MI.",

            "text": "CD13KO mice have normal myeloid profiles, function, and differentiation.20 Following MI, we observe fewer total CD45+ haematopoietic cells in the infarcts of global CD13KO mice suggesting a generalized defect in inflammatory trafficking, consistent with our characterization of CD13 as an adhesion molecule regulating the monocyte\u2013endothelial interactions critical for inflammatory trafficking.18 Logically, fewer infiltrating monocytes would result in fewer macrophages and DCs and concomitant reductions in the cytokines they elicit. Indeed, we see lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 transcripts, which very likely is responsible for the diminished myofibroblast numbers as well. Elegant studies have demonstrated that infarct healing occurs in a biphasic manner that depends on the sequential trafficking of pro-inflammatory monocytes (Ly6chigh phase I, peaking at day 3) followed by a reparative subset (Ly6clow, phase II, peaking at day 7). Importantly, these phases must occur in sequence, as eliminating phase I alone resulted in a suboptimal phase II and consequent impaired healing. CD13 expression is significantly higher in pro-inflammatory monocytes than in the reparative subset,34 raising the intriguing possibility that CD13 regulates trafficking of Gr-1high, but not Gr-1low monocytes. In our study, the reduced numbers of pro-inflammatory monocytes in phase I would in turn affect the recruitment of the reparative monocytes in phase II, leading to impaired healing of the infarcted tissue and impaired function in CD13KO hearts. In agreement with our data, studies where monocyte or macrophage populations were either depleted or functionally impaired, the response to infarction phenocopies the decrease in cell numbers that we see in the CD13KO animals and results in significant reductions in heart function.5,7,8 These findings would suggest that the decrease in infiltrating inflammatory cells in CD13KO animals could be largely responsible for the adverse remodelling in CD13KO hearts. Paradoxically, other studies suggest the reverse; that decreased monocyte/macrophage infiltration promotes tissue repair and less adverse remodelling.10\u201312 Taken together, these contradictory findings are believed to reflect a critical balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory activities in the healing heart. Evidence suggests that optimal healing following permanent ligation depends on the precise co-ordination of the timing, phenotype, and quantity of infiltrating inflammatory cells1,14 in that either excessive inflammation or repression of inflammatory activity may derail repair.14 The question whether CD13 exclusively regulates pro-inflammatory monocyte trafficking or may designate an additional subset is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",

We have recently shown a novel function for CD13 in DCs where it regulates antigen uptake and presentation,19 suggesting that in addition to trafficking, the lack of CD13 may also impact the function of DCs in the wound. Endogenous antigens released from damaged tissue are recognized by DCs via pattern recognition receptors and often trigger extreme inflammatory responses resulting in further damage.39,40 Alternatively, a clear role for DCs has been demonstrated in repair where global depletion of DCs exacerbated adverse remodelling post-MI,9 in agreement with our results. In contrast, however, the DC-ablated infarcts showed substantially increased pro-inflammatory monocyte/macrophage infiltration in striking opposition to the decreased numbers found in the CD13KO infarcts. Because DCs are present in the CD13KO infarcted hearts, this discrepancy strongly suggests that the lack of CD13 alters the normally protective function of DCs in the wound healing process. The role of DCs in remodelling and the novel CD13-dependent mechanisms regulating their function in vivo are an exciting and unexplored field that is currently under study in our laboratory.",

This increase did not result in better perfusion, as the perfused area was similar in infarcts of both genotypes. A similar increase in small, immature vessels was reported in reperfusion studies, where neutralization of platelet-derived growth factor receptors significantly increased capillary density.42 While this study did not directly address vessel perfusion or mural cell function, the phenotype was interpreted to be the result of impaired pericyte coverage leading to uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation. CD13 is also expressed on pericytes43 and thus, could possibly contribute to their function. In vitro assessment of endothelial cell morphogenesis by capillary network formation assays confirmed our earlier inhibitor studies, demonstrating that CD13 is required for functional angiogenesis and the equivalent numbers of larger vessels in the CD13WT and CD13KO animals suggest that compensatory mechanisms may be triggered in the heart in vivo in an attempt to overcome the lack of CD13. While gene array analysis of resting macrophages indicates that expression levels of 99.7% of genes differ by <two-fold between WT and CD13KO cells,20 we have not explored potential expression changes in the endothelium.",

However, we see considerable remodelling despite comparable myocyte function in myocytes from WT and CD13KO animals at 7 days, illustrating that this is not necessarily the case and that remodelling is influenced by many contributing factors. Alternatively, it is possible that the similar degree of myocyte function of WT and CD13KO mice may be due to a reported transient increase in myocyte contractility early (7 days) after LAD ligation.45 However, despite similarities in individual myocyte contractility, CD13KO hearts are functionally impaired in both the short (7 days) and long terms (60 days), arguing against such a temporary increase in myocyte function.",

Ultimately, this study confirms our previous in vitro data and identifies CD13 as a novel and important immune adhesion molecule where optimal healing requires CD13 in vivo. Importantly, it also illustrates that although transendothelial migration has been well studied,46 our knowledge of the mechanisms and molecules that regulate it remains incomplete. Determining exactly how CD13 integrates with classical trafficking mechanisms is an intriguing challenge that will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the nuances that fine-tune the innate immune system. Similarly, the recently identified monocyte, macrophage, and DC subpopulations will certainly have to be selectively recruited to sites of injury to perform their specialized functions, and thus, identification of novel molecules directing this traffic may prove to be particularly valuable therapeutic targets.",
