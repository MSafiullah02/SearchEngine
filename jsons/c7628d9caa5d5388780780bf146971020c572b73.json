Here, we attempted to eradicate influenza virus from the respiratory organs of nude mice, which is a model of immunocompromised hosts, by using combination therapy of the viral polymerase inhibitor favipiravir and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptorbinding site (RBS) and stem of viral hemagglutinin (HA). Although monotherapy or combination therapy of two antivirals (two mAbs or favipiravir plus a mAb) suppressed virus replication, they failed to eradicate viruses from nude mice. In contrast, the triple combination therapy of favipiravir plus anti-Stem and anti-RBS mAbs completely stopped virus replication in nude mice, resulting in virus clearance. Triple combination approaches should be considered for the treatment of human immunocompromised patients with severe influenza.",

The time to influenza symptom alleviation is similar between one of the polymerase inhibitors, baloxavir marboxil, and the NA inhibitors; however, treatment with baloxavir marboxil efficiently reduces the viral load compared with treatment with an NA inhibitor within 1 day of initiation of treatment 1 . Another polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir (FAV), which is also known as T705, was approved in Japan in 2014 with an indication limited to treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections unresponsive or insufficiently responsive to available antivirals 2 . Mutant viruses resistant to FAV are rarely isolated in vitro and in vivo with one exceptional case 3 . Although detection of viruses that exhibit reduced susceptibility to NA inhibitors or baloxavir marboxil in immunocompetent patients has frequently been reported 1,4-9 , such viruses usually do not dominate susceptible viruses with the exception of the worldwide spread of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 virus in the 2007-2008 season. Recently, broadly protective human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against conserved regions of HA, including the receptorbinding site (RBS) and stem region, have been evaluated [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and studies for their clinical application are being conducted [17] [18] [19] [20] .

In our previous study, monotherapy with an NA inhibitor (oseltamivir or laninamivir) for 28 days did not improve the survival time of infected nude mice, whereas monotherapy with a virus polymerase inhibitor (FAV or baloxavir) or combination therapy of FAV plus an NA inhibitor (oseltamivir or laninamivir) for 28 days increased it 26, 27 .

To assess virus clearance from an immunocompromised host, we intranasally infected nude mice with 10 3 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of MA-CA04. The infected mice were treated with FAV at 100 mg/kg once a day for 28 days, a human mAb against the HA stem (clone CR9114) at 5 mg/kg once per 3 days for 14 days, or a human mAb against the RBS of HA (clone F3A19) at 1 mg/kg once per 3 days for 14 days, alone or in combination (Table 1) . Methyl cellulose plus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and a human mAb against the HA of influenza B virus were administrated as negative controls. Body weight change and survival of these mice were monitored for 188 days. All of mice that received methyl cellulose plus PBS or the anti-B HA mAb died within 8 days of infection; median survival was 6 days ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Infected mice that were treated with FAV alone died between 38 and 42 days post infection (median survival, 40 days), whereas two or three out of four mice that received the anti-Stem or anti-RBS mAb alone died within 8 days post infection, and the remaining mice died at 51 or 37 days post infection (median survival, 29.5 or 8 days). Monotherapy with FAV or the anti-RBS mAb significantly increased the survival time of the infected mice compared with the methyl cellulose plus PBS-treated group (P < 0.01; log-rank test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Mice treated with the combination of FAV plus anti-Stem mAb, FAV plus anti-RBS mAb, or anti-Stem mAb plus anti-RBS mAb survived for significantly longer than the control groups, but died between 39 and 155 days post infection (median survival, 119.5, 71.5, or 45 days, P < 0.01). The hazard ratio was decreased by all treatments tested (Table 1 ). In all lungs of dead mice after termination of the combination therapies with two antivirals, viruses were detected at 5.7-6.9 log 10 PFU/g, indicating that the viruses were not eradicated from the nude mice by the combination therapies with two antivirals. In contrast, all four mice that received the triple combination therapy of FAV, anti-Stem mAb, and anti-RBS mAb survived for 188 days ( Fig. 1 , P < 0.01) and did not harbor detectable viruses in the lung at day 188. These results show that the triple combination therapy of FAV, anti-Stem mAb, and anti-RBS mAb can eradicate influenza virus from immunocompromised hosts.",

To evaluate the degree of virus clearance, three nude mice per group infected with 10 3 PFU of MA-CA04 were treated as described in Table 1 and virus titers were measured in the lungs of treated mice at 7, 14, and 28 days post infection. The virus titers in the lungs of the mice that received methyl cellulose plus PBS or anti-B HA mAb were 7.4 or 7.2 log 10 PFU/g, respectively, at day 7 ( Table 2) . Compared with the methyl cellulose plus PBS-treated group, the virus titers in the lungs of mice at day 7 were significantly decreased by treatment with FAV, FAV plus anti-Stem mAb, FAV plus anti-RBS mAb, or FAV plus both mAbs, but were not affected by treatment with anti-Stem mAb, anti-RBS mAb, or anti-Stem mAb plus anti-RBS mAb ( Table 2) . Virus titers at day 14 post infection were significantly reduced by treatment with FAV plus anti-Stem mAb, FAV plus anti-RBS mAb, anti-Stem mAb plus anti-RBS mAb, or FAV plus both mAbs compared with the anti-Stem mAb-treated group. At day 28 post infection, virus titers were significantly reduced by treatment with FAV, FAV plus anti-Stem mAb, FAV plus anti-RBS mAb, or FAV plus both mAbs compared with the anti-Stem mAb-treated group ( Table 2) . Of note, no infectious viruses or viral RNA were detected at day 28 in the lungs of mice treated with FAV plus Anti-RBS mAb or FAV plus both mAbs by plaque assay and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting to the NS segment. Taken together with the survival data, these results demonstrate that the triple combination therapy of FAV, anti-Stem mAb, and anti-RBS mAb can eradicate virus from the lungs of nude mice. Viruses and viral genomes were not detected in the lungs of mice treated with FAV plus anti-RBS mAb, but these mice died between 51 and 100 days post infection. The cause of death of these mice remains unknown; it is possible that virus was likely present in these mice, but was under the level of detection at day 28 and likely started to replicate upon discontinuation of the medication.",

To examine whether such mutants emerged in nude mice after FAV treatment, we examined the sensitivity of viruses isolated from the lungs of killed and dead mice that were treated with FAV alone or in combination. The sensitivity of each isolate to FAV was measured by using plaque reduction assays. Based on the IC 50 values obtained, all tested viruses showed similar sensitivity to FAV as the wild-type virus ( Table 3) . As the viruses isolated from the mouse lungs might be a mixed population of wild-type virus and virus with reduced susceptibility to FAV, we purified three clones from the lungs of mice treated with FAV or FAV plus anti-Stem mAb and killed at 28 days post infection by plaque purification, and then tested the sensitivity of the plaque-purified viruses to FAV in a plaque reduction assay. The IC 50 values of all tested plaque-purified viruses to FAV were similar to that of wild-type virus, indicating that mutant viruses with reduced sensitivity to FAV did not emerge after treatment with FAV alone or in combination.",

To clarify whether such mutant viruses emerged after mAb treatment, we analyzed the genome sequence of viruses from the lungs of mice treated with anti-Stem or anti-RBS mAb alone or in combination. For this, we used the lung samples derived from mice killed at 14 days post infection, the day of treatment termination, for virus titration and from mice that died after 37 days post infection (Table 4) . By Sanger sequencing, zero to five mutations were found in the HA of virus in the lung of mice treated with mAbs (Table 4 ). In particular, amino acid mutations in HA were detected in a higher proportion of viruses in the FAV plus anti-Stem mAb-treated mice than in the other groups tested. These amino acid mutations were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the H1-HA trimer. The amino acids at positions 125, 128, 186, 188, 192, and 198 mapped to the top of the HA head, the amino acids at positions 49, 390, and 392 mapped to the lower part of the HA head, and the amino acid at position 362 mapped to the HA stem (Fig. 2) . We then asked whether these mutant viruses escaped from the anti-Stem and anti-RBS mAbs that we used for Four mice for the survival study and 3 or 9 mice for the virus titer assessment (1 or 3 timepoints; 3 mice per timepoint).",

In our previous nude mouse model study, mono-or combination therapy of NA inhibitors (oseltamivir or laninamivir) and/or virus polymerase inhibitors (FAV or baloxavir) increased survival time but failed to achieve virus clearance, resulting in death after termination of treatment 26, 27 . In the present study, we attempted to eradicate viruses from the respiratory organs of nude mice by using combination therapy of FAV and two mAbs against the HA RBS and stem. Although treatment with FAV or a combination of two antivirals improved the survival time of infected nude mice, all of the mice that received such treatments died with high virus titers in their lungs during the observation period, suggesting that these treatments failed to achieve virus clearance from the respiratory organs. In contrast, influenza virus was successfully eradicated from nude mice by the triple combination therapy of FAV and mAbs against the HA RBS and stem: all mice that received this treatment survived for 188 days and did not harbor infectious viruses in the lungs at 188 days post infection. Our data thus suggest that this triple combination therapy can completely stop virus replication. Triple combination therapy of antivirals with different mechanisms of action might cause a strong synergistic effect, which would support a triple combination approach to the treatment of human immunocompromised patients with influenza. For resistant viruses to emerge, they must replicate under the suppressive pressure of antivirals. Therefore, it is important to sufficiently suppress or ultimately block virus replication to prevent the emergence of resistant viruses. Our data show that the triple combination therapy of FAV, anti-Stem mAb, and anti-RBS mAb completely stopped virus replication in infected nude mice, leading to virus clearance. Our triple combination therapy is, therefore, less likely than current monotherapies to lead to the emergence of resistant virus in immunocompromised hosts.",
