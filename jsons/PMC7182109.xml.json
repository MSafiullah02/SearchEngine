Large solutes have low diffusion coefficients and therefore diffuse more slowly than small solutes. The diffusion rate for a particular solute under physiological conditions is a constant and cannot be increased. This defines the theoretical limit for an enzymatic reaction rate and also limits the size of a cell. If a solute starts at the center of a bacterial cell, it takes about 10\u22123\n s to diffuse to the plasma membrane. For this reason, typical cells are microscopic (see Chapter 1). At about 3.3 pounds and the size of a cantaloupe, the largest cell on Earth today is the ostrich egg. However a fossilized dinosaur egg in the American Museum of Natural History in New York is about the size of basketball. Since an egg's only function is to store nutrients for a developing embryo, its size is many orders of magnitude larger than a normal cell.",

Water readily crosses a membrane down its potential gradient from high to low potential (Fig. 19.3\n) [4]. Osmotic pressure is the force required to prevent water movement across the semipermeable membrane. Net water movement continues until its potential reaches zero. An early application of the basic principles of osmosis came from the pioneering work on hemolysis of red blood cells by William Hewson in the 1770s (see Chapter 2). It has also been discussed that MLVs (multilamellar vesicles, liposomes) behave as almost perfect osmometers, swelling in hypotonic solutions and shrinking in hypertonic solutions (see Chapter 3) [5], [6]. Liposome swelling and shrinking can be easily followed by changes in absorbance due to light scattering using a simple spectrophotometer. Therefore, osmosis has been investigated for many years using common and inexpensive methodologies and a lot is known about the process.",

Passive diffusion requires no additional energy source other than what is found in the solute's electrochemical (concentration) gradient and results in the solute reaching equilibrium across the membrane. Passive diffusion can be either simple passive diffusion where the solute crosses the membrane anywhere by simply dissolving into and diffusing through the lipid bilayer, or facilitated passive diffusion where the solute crosses the membrane at specific locations where diffusion is assisted by solute-specific facilitators or carriers. Active transport requires additional energy, often in the form of ATP, and results in a nonequilibrium, net accumulation (uptake) of the solute on one side of the membrane. The basic types of membrane transport, simple passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion (by channels and carriers) and active transport are summarized in Fig. 19.4\n[8]. There are countless different examples of each type of membrane transport process [7]. Only a few representative examples will be discussed here.",

The limiting step involves the energy required to lose the waters of hydration. Table 19.2\nshows the relationship between the waters of hydration (proportional to the number of \u2014OH groups on a homologous series of solutes) and the activation energy for transmembrane diffusion. As the number of waters of hydration increases from glycol < glycerol < erythritol, the activation energy for diffusion also increases.

Statistical pores result from the simultaneous lateral movement of adjacent membrane phospholipids in opposite directions. Statistical pores have only a fleeting existence and cannot be isolated or imaged.3.Passage down water chains.4.Water can be carried down kinks in acyl chains that result from acyl chain melting (see lipid melting in Chapter 9).5.Water may rapidly cross membranes through nonlamellar regions (eg, micelles, cubic or HII phase\u2014see Chapter 10).6.High water permeability will occur at regions of packing defect (eg, surface of integral membrane proteins, boundary between membrane domains).7.Through pores or channels used to conduct ions.8.Through specific water channels known as aquaporins (see below, Chapter 19, Section 3.5).\n",

From the activation energies for transmembrane simple passive diffusion of glycol, glycerol and erythritol presented in Table 19.2, it can be estimated that the activation energy for glucose should be well over 100 kJ/mol, but instead it is only 16 kJ/mol. This large discrepancy is attributed to the presence of a glucose-facilitated diffusion carrier. Fig. 19.6\ndemonstrates the mode of action of one of these transporters, GLUT-1, from the erythrocyte [10]. GLUTs occur in nearly all cells and are particularly abundant in cells lining the small intestine. GLUTs are but one example in a superfamily of transport facilitators. GLUTs are integral membrane proteins whose membrane-spanning region is composed of 12 \u03b1-helices. GLUTs function through a typical membrane transport mechanism [10]. Glucose binds to the membrane outer surface site causing a conformational change associated with transport across the membrane. At the inner side of the membrane, glucose is released into the internal aqueous solution (Fig. 19.6).\n",

In excitable cells such as neurons, myocytes, and some glia, Na+ channels are responsible for the rising phase of action potentials (see Chapter 18). Therefore agents that block Na+ channels also block nerve conduction and so are deadly neurotoxins. There are two basic types of Na+ channels: voltage-gated and ligand-gated. The opening of a Na+ channel has a selectivity filter that attracts Na+. From there the Na+ ions flow into a constricted part of the channel that is about 3\u20135 \u00c5 wide. This is just large enough to allow the passage of a single Na+ with one attached water. Since the larger K+ cannot squeeze through, the channel is selective for Na+. Of particular interest are two extremely potent biological toxins, tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) (Fig. 19.9\n, [14]), that, in seafood, have killed and injured many humans.

However, these methods of water permeability could not come close to explaining the rapid movement of water across some cells. Although it had been predicted that water pores must exist in very leaky cells, it was not until 1992 that Peter Agre (Fig. 19.10\n) at Johns Hopkins University identified a specific transmembrane water pore that was later called aquaporin-1. For this accomplishment Agre shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Rod MacKinnon for his work on the potassium channel. Aquaporins are usually specific for water permeability and exclude the passage of other solutes. A type of aquaporin known as aqua-glyceroporins can also conduct some very small uncharged solutes such as glycerol, CO2, ammonia, and urea across the membrane. However, all aquaporins are impermeable to charged solutes. Water molecules traverse the aquaporin channel in single file (Fig. 19.11\n) [17].",

Transported sugars include glucose, mannose, fructose, and cellobiose. Components of the system include both plasma membrane and cytosolic enzymes. PEP is a high-energy phosphorylated compound (\u0394G of hydrolysis is \u221261.9 kJ/mol) that drives the system. The high-energy phosphoryl group is transferred through an enzyme bucket brigade from PEP to glucose producing glucose-6-phosphate in several steps (PEP \u2192 EI \u2192 HPr \u2192EIIA \u2192 EIIB \u2192 EIIC \u2192 glucose-6-phosphate). The sequence is depicted in more detail in Fig. 19.17\n[27]. HPr stands for heat-stable protein that carries the high-energy \u223cP from EI (enzyme-I) to EIIA. EIIA is specific for glucose and transfers \u223cP to EIIB that sits next to the membrane where it takes glucose from the transmembrane EIIC and phosphorylates it producing glucose-6-phosphate. Although it is glucose that is being transported across the membrane, it never actually appears inside the cell as free glucose but rather as glucose-6-phosphate. Free glucose could leak back out of the cell via a glucose transporter, but glucose-6-phosphate is trapped inside the cell where it can rapidly be metabolized through glycolysis. Group translocation is defined by a transported solute appearing in a different form immediately after crossing the membrane.",

It is for this reason that valinomycin was recognized as an antibiotic long before it was identified as an ionophore. Currently several ionophores are added to animal feed as antibiotics and growth enhancing additives [33].

It is a synthetic lipid-soluble proton ionophore that dissipates proton gradients across bioenergetic membranes (mitochondrial inner, thylakoid, bacterial plasma). An uncoupler is therefore an H+-facilitated diffusion carrier. Elucidating the role of DNP in uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation was an essential component in support of Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis [25]. Electron movement from NADH or FADH2 to O2 via the mitochondrial electron transport system generates a considerable amount of electrical energy that is partially captured as a transmembrane pH gradient (see Chapter 18). The movement of H+s back across the membrane, driven by the electrochemical gradient, is through a channel in the F1ATPase (an F-type primary active transport system discussed above, (Chapter 19, Section 4.1)) that is coupled to ATP synthesis. DNP short-circuits the H+ gradient before it can pass through the F1ATPase, thus uncoupling electron transport, the energy source for the H+ gradient, from ATP synthesis. Therefore, in the presence of DNP, electron transport continues, even at an accelerated rate, but ATP production is diminished. The energy that should have been converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP is then released as excess heat.",

The first crown ether was synthesized by Charles Pederson (Fig. 19.20\n) while working at DuPont in 1967. For this work Pedersen was co-awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Crown ethers are cyclic compounds composed of several ether groups. The most common crown ethers are oligomers of ethylene oxide with repeating units of (\u2014CH2CH2O\u2014)n where n\n = 4 (tetramer), n\n = 5 (pentamer), or n\n = 6 (hexamer). Crown ethers are given structural names, X-crown-Y, where X is the total number of atoms in the ring and Y is the number of these atoms that are oxygen. Crown refers to the crown-like shape the molecule takes. Crown ether oxygens form complexes with specific cations that depend on the number of atoms in the ring. For example, 18-crown-6 (Fig. 19.19) has high affinity for K+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, and 12-crown-4 for Li+. Like valinomycin, the exterior of the ring is hydrophobic, allowing crown ethers to dissolve in the membrane lipid bilayer while carrying the sequestered cation down its electrochemical gradient. It is now possible to tailor make crown ethers of different sizes that can encase a variety of catalysts for phase transfer into the bilayer hydrophobic interior where they can be used to catalyze reactions inside the membrane.",

Nystatin, like other channel-forming ionophores (eg, amphotericin B and natamycin), is a commonly used antifungal agent. Finding medications that can selectively attack fungi in the presence of normal animal cells presents a difficult challenge since both cell types are eukaryotic. Bacteria, being prokaryotes, are sufficiently different to present a variety of anti-bacterial approaches not amenable to fungi. However, fungi do have an Achilles heel. Fungal plasma membranes have as their dominant sterol ergosterol, not the animal sterol cholesterol (see Chapter 5). Nystatin binds preferentially to ergosterol, thus targeting fungi in the presence of animal cells. When present at sufficient levels, nystatin complexes with ergosterol and forms transmembrane channels that lead to K+ leakage and death of the fungus. Nystatin is a polyene antifungal ionophore that is effective against many molds and yeast including Candida. A major use of nystatin is as a prophylaxis for AIDS patients who are at risk for fungal infections.",

In humans, this process occurs in cells lining the small intestine and is used primarily for absorption of fat droplets. In endocytosis the cell plasma membrane extends and folds around desired extracellular material, forming a pouch that pinches off creating an internalized vesicle (Fig. 19.22\n, [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]). The invaginated pinocytosis vesicles are much smaller than those generated by phagocytosis. The vesicles eventually fuse with the lysosome whereupon the vesicle contents are digested. Pinocytosis involves a considerable investment of cellular energy in the form of ATP and so is many 1000 times less efficient than RME (see Chapter 17). Also, in sharp contrast to RME, pinocytosis is nonspecific for the substances it accumulates. Pinocytosis is not a recent discovery as it was first observed decades before the other transport systems discussed in Chapter 19. Its discovery is attributed to Warren Lewis in 1929.",

Fig. 19.23\n[48] depicts events in phagacytosis. Phagocytosis is a routine process that ameba and ciliated protozoa use to obtain food. In humans, phagocytosis is restricted to specialized cells called phagocytes that include white blood cell neutrophils and macrophages. As with pinocytosis, phagocytosis generates intracellular vesicles called phagosomes that have sequestered solid particles they transport to the lysosome for digestion. Phagocytosis is a major mechanism used by the immune system to remove pathogens and cell debris. In fact, very early studies of the immune system led Elie Metchnikoff to discover phagocytosis in 1882. For this work Metchnikoff shared the 1908 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Paul Ehrlich.",

In exocytosis, intracellular (secretory) vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their aqueous sequestered contents to the outside at the same time that the vesicular membrane hydrophobic components (mostly lipids and proteins) are added to the plasma membrane (Fig. 19.24\n, [50]). Steady state composition of the plasma membrane results from a balance between endocytosis and exocytosis. The resultant process of plasma membrane recycling is amazingly fast. For example, pancreatic secretory cells recycles an amount of membrane equal to the whole surface of the cell in \u223c90 min. Even faster are macrophages that can recycle contents of their plasma membrane in only 30 min.",

It is clear in Fig. 19.25\n[54] that the plasma membrane of an apoptotic cell is highly disintegrated and has lost the integrity required to maintain essential transmembrane gradients. Blebbing is also involved in some normal cell processes, including cell locomotion and cell division.\n",

            "text": "Carefully controlled solute movement into and out of cells is an essential feature of life. There are many ways solutes are transported across the thin (\u223c40 \u00c5) membrane hydrophobic barrier. Transport is divided into passive diffusion and active transport. A biological membrane is semipermeable, being permeable to some molecules, most notably water (osmosis), while being very impermeable to most solutes that require some form of transporter. Passive diffusion (simple and facilitated) only requires the energy inherent in the solute's electrochemical gradient and results in its equilibrium across the membrane. In contrast, active transport requires additional energy (ie, ATP), and results in a nonequilibrium, net accumulation of the solute. Passive transport can involve simple diffusion or facilitated carriers including ionophores and channels. Active transport comes in many, often complex forms. Examples of active transport include primary active transport (uniport), secondary active transport (co-transport, antiport), and group translocation. Besides the multitude of transport systems, transport can be accomplished by gap junctions, receptor mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, exocytosis, and apoptotic membrane blebbing.",

The column of water in the tube's right arm (the one containing the solute) rises until the extra weight of the column equals the osmotic pressure caused by the solute. A pump could then be used to counter the osmotic pressure whereupon the solution columns in the right and left arms of the tube are made the same. The pump pressure required to equalize the height of the two columns is the osmotic pressure [4]. Note a small amount of the solute leaks from right to left since no filter is perfect.",
