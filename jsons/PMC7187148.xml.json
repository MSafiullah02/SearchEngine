A descriptive study of a small sample of 24 (63% were men) critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Seattle region was among the first to report BMI data (3 patients with a BMI in the normal category, 7 with overweight, 13 with obesity and 1 with missing data). Although the numbers are too small for meaningful statistical analyses, 85% of the patients with obesity required mechanical ventilation and 62% of the patients with obesity died. These proportions are greater than those in the patients without obesity, in which 64% required mechanical ventilation and 36% died4. As CVD and diabetes mellitus are strongly associated with elevated adipose tissue mass5, a high BMI might be an important risk factor for a severe course of disease, particularly of pneumonia, in these patients.",

Among 383 patients from Shenzhen with COVID-19, overweight was associated with an 86% higher, and obesity with a 142% higher, risk of developing severe pneumonia compared with patients of normal weight in statistical models that controlled for potential confounders6. Among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 at an academic health system in New York City, BMI >40 kg/m2 was the second strongest independent predictor of hospitalization, after old age7. Furthermore, in a small study from a university hospital in Lille, France, reporting data from 124 patients with COVID-19, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation was associated with a BMI \u226535 kg/m2, independently of other comorbidities8. The parameters mediating this high risk are thought to include impaired respiratory mechanics, increased airway resistance and impaired gas exchange, as well as other pathophysiological features of obesity, such as low respiratory muscle strength and lung volumes9.",

These parameters include BMI, waist and hip circumferences and levels of glucose and insulin. The latter two parameters can be used for the estimation of insulin resistance, for example by calculation of the HOMA-IR. Knowledge about insulin resistance is important, because it is among the strongest determinants of impaired metabolic health, cardiac dysfunction and CVD-related mortality5. Such measurements might be useful both in a primary care setting and in a hospital setting to assess the risk of a complicated course of disease in patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (Fig. 1).",
