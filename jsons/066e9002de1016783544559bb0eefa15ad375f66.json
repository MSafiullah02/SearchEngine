One-way ANOVA analysis was carried out to determine the statistical significance of treatment related to survival. p < 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**), and 0.0001 (****) were considered significant. Fluorescence from small molecular fragment by-products generated form hydrothermal synthesis is often a major concern in CQD synthesis [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . We found that purification using silica column chromatography for three rounds is the most effective for this specific CQDs and further dialysis, which is useful for purification of some CQDs 29 , did not provide additional benefits. Given their efficient NIR absorption features, the photothermal performance of LAAM TC-CQDs aqueous solution are investigated. The temperatures of LAAM TC-CQDs aqueous solution at various concentrations (0-10 \u03bcg/mL) are monitored under continuous laser irradiation (650 nm, 0.5 W/cm 2 ) with an infrared thermal camera, as displayed in Fig. S12a . No obvious temperature rise is observed in the control sample of pure water, while LAAM TC-CQDs (10 \u03bcg/mL) could quickly trigger the increase of temperature and display a concentration-dependent hyperthermia (above 42 o C) during a short photoirradiation (5 min), leading to an irreversible damage to tumor cells 3, 4 . To further study the photothermal stability and transduction efficiency of LAAM TC-CQDs, LAAM TC-CQDs aqueous solution (10 \u03bcg/mL, 3 mL) is continuously illuminated by a 650 nm laser (0.5 W/cm 2 ) until it reaches a steady-state temperature, at which point the laser is stopped and the suspension is allowed to cool naturally. The temperature change during the heating-cooling process is monitored for five cycles to derive a heat generation-dissipation curve as shown in Fig. S12b . An almost equal temperature elevation of 25.6 \u00b0C occurred during each laser ON/OFF cycle, suggesting that LAAM TC-CQDs possess preferable photothermal stability compared with extensively used organic dyes and inorganic nanomaterials with surface plasmon resonance [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .

Single cycle kinetic experiments were performed without regeneration. The binding was determined by surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore T100 (GE Healthcare). Regarding characterization of the binding using HeLa cells: The measurement of Km was performed in the presence and absence of inhibitors (BCH). To determine the non-specific binding, cells were pretreated with BCH, a LAT1 inhibitor, at 5 mM, following with LAAM TC-CQD treatment and flow cytometry analysis. The fluorescence intensity was obtained by flow cytometry on a population of 10,000 cells. LAT1-dependent uptake was obtained by subtracting the non-specific binding from the total binding. Km was obtained by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data using weighted nonlinear least-squares. Figure S40 and the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs were obtained from Figure S18 and 19 ). ",
