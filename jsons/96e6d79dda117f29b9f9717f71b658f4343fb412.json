The content discussed at each bedside during rounds was inconsistent, contributing to the irregular achievement of established FCR checklist items. Methods: Using a scheduling tool with a prioritization algorithm and set time allotment/patient, we implemented schedule-based family-centered rounds (SBFCR) on a pediatric acute care unit. Primary outcome metrics included RN attendance and participation. We tracked rounding checklist compliance, parent presence on rounds, and adherence to the schedule. Surveys provided information on provider and family satisfaction. Perceived impact on teaching was the balancing measure because the structure discouraged spending extra time at the cost of team tardiness for the next patient. Results: We created a schedule for 95% workweek days, with the rounding order kept for 93%. Mean RN attendance increased from 69% to 87% and participation increased from 48% to 80% with SBFCR (P < 0.001 for each). FCR checklist compliance increased from 60% to 94% (P < 0.001). Families felt more informed and able to attend; their presence at rounds rose from 66% to 85% (P < 0.001). Most faculty and trainees felt SBFCR was efficient and observed increased teaching with SBFCR. Conclusions: SBFCR provides an organizational framework for increased RN attendance and participation as well as greater family presence during rounds. The system elevated provider satisfaction with rounding without degrading the perceived educational experience.",

FCR, central to family-centered care, aims to encourage shared decision making between families and providers. 4, 5 Medical rounds must accomplish several functions, including creating and clarifying the plan of care for the family and interdisciplinary team, discharge preparation, and trainee teaching. Our multidisciplinary teams aim for \"one-message-one-time\" during morning rounds. 6 Bedside nurses (RNs) are key members of the healthcare team and carry out the daily plan while serving as the central point of communication for the patient and family. RNs are uniquely positioned to provide real-time patient information and detect and report out clinical changes due to their frequent contact with the patient. 7 The presence of nursing during FCR is critical for effective communication that contributes to high quality and safer patient care. [1] [2] [3] 8 Rounds, however, are just one of many morning tasks for RNs caring for multiple patients.",

We developed a key driver framework during interviews, observation of rounds, and design sessions (Fig. 1 ) and aligned on a vision for our primary intervention, SBFCR. 10 To establish a reliable daily schedule for rounds, the improvement team set a standard start time and per-patient time allotment. Using a time-motion methodology described by Bhansali et al., 11 times were established in early 2015 after observation of 128 discrete rounding encounters over a convenience sample of 8 weekdays. The improvement team developed a prioritization scheme to determine how patients were scheduled. Priority was given to acutely ill patients, then grouped by service, time of discharge, and need for interpreter services. The SBFCR checklist helped teams cover all key elements in the time allotted on the schedule (see Family Centered Rounds for Each Patient: In order, by roles with associated content, and FCR checklist.

All team members, including ancillary staff and consultants, had access to the schedule saved to a secure cloud storage site. PACT encounters defaulted to 10 minutes/patient and GC encounters to 8 minutes/patient with no extra time scheduled between patients. The medical team then had the option to flex up or down the duration of time allotted per patient before posting the final schedule. On rounds, an audible cue signaled when 2 minutes remained in a patient's allotted time. If the team finished an encounter early, they used the extra time between patients for order entry or teaching. We implemented a standard plan to get back on schedule in the case of delays: if the team was behind >4 minutes, the team skipped the next patient and resumed SBFCR with the following patient. The skipped patient was rounded on later during built-in buffer time (16 min between PACT and GC patients) or at the end of scheduled patients.",

Phase I began July 13, 2015, with the implementation of all the SBFCR components during the workweek. The 14-month intervention was continued to September 30, 2016. We communicated adherence to SBFCR with a visibility board updated by case management and nursing leaders. Nurses who missed rounding encounters were interviewed to understand barriers to full participation. Weekly feedback sessions with the improvement team and rounding team were held to facilitate subsequent Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. By September 2015, on request from RNs, SBFCR expanded to include weekends (PDSA 1). Consistently, RNs assigned to patients with ventricular-assist devices accompanied them to hospital school at 9:00 am, thus missing later rounds. In December 2015, the case manager adjusted the schedule before finalizing it to move these patients before 9:00 am (PDSA 2), and family prephase II surveys were collected. Phase II began January 2016 with patient/family notification of rounding window (\u00b1 15 min of the specific scheduled time) and educating families about SBFCR (Family education brochure describing SBFCR. See Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww. com/PQ9/A164). In February 2016, we implemented a daily huddle before rounds to review the schedule and anticipated admissions (PDSA 3). We conducted postimplementation surveys for providers during March 2016, and for families in June 2016. After 14 months, following completion of data collection, the scheduling algorithm was adapted into an electronic health record tool to help automate the schedule creation (for an example of SBFCR schedule as created in EPIC web tool, see Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/ PQ9/A165). Once published, anyone can access the schedule from within the electronic health record. This intervention has facilitated sustainability by streamlining the scheduling process, enabling the spread of SBFCR to other acute care services.",

We defined attendance as being present to listen to rounds and participation as the bedside RN delivering the patient introduction, overnight events and vital signs, and his/her concerns. The case manager collected data from Monday to Friday, which included FCR start and end time, number of patients, and whether the team adhered to the scheduling order. RN attendance and participation, family member presence, FCR checklist items (pain management discussion, central line and telemetry monitoring needs, and target discharge date), and deviations between expected and actual rounding time were tracked for every patient. P-charts were made to track our primary aim with average weekly % nurse attendance (Fig. 2) and % nurse participation (Fig. 3) . 12 We examined in detail one random week per month to assess the team's compliance with keeping SBFCR patient order and timeliness and how these features affected RN and family participation. Additionally, nursing management tracked RN attendance daily on the unit's visibility board with notes on obstacles to rounds participation. These barriers were reviewed weekly by the multidisciplinary improvement team to inform new interventions to trial. We conducted surveys to measure provider and RN satisfaction with the rounding process before and 8 months after implementation. These surveys were modified from surveys used during routine FCR implementation at our hospital. Due to small group sizes and desire for anonymity, we combined responses from trainees and nurse practitioners. The RN surveys focused on the impact of rounds attendance on care coordination and communication. We assessed attending physician, trainee, and nurse practitioner perception of the effect on teaching on the postimplementation survey as a balancing metric; the majority had experienced cardiology rounds before and after SBFCR. Families were surveyed before and after phase II. All survey questions used a Likert scale for responses as follows: (1) strongly agree; (2) agree; (3) neutral; (4) disagree; and (5) strongly disagree. We considered a positive response as \"agree\" or \"strongly agree.\"",

When the team rounded out of scheduled order (n = 57), the RN attendance fell to 77%, and participation decreased to 68% (P value = 0.037 and 0.047, respectively, compared to % when in order). The medical team began rounds within 5 minutes of the scheduled time in 53% of these 861 encounters. Timeliness within 5 minutes of the exact scheduled time did not affect RN attendance or participation. For phase II, we assessed timeliness to the rounding window given to parents. The team rounded during this window for 83% of encounters.",

Most fellows, residents, and nurse practitioners felt the team had to wait less for the nurse, the interpreter, or other ancillary members to start rounds after SBFCR implementation. Most RNs agreed that attending rounds facilitated communication with families, understanding of the care plan, and care coordination. All providers and most RNs felt there was sufficient time to round on each patient. All faculty strongly agreed that SBFCR is an efficient use of their time.

Aragona et al. 15 postulated that improved coordination of patient rounding time and other nurse responsibilities would likely improve nurse attendance, and scheduling rounds was an organizational strategy identified to improve family engagement in FCR. SBFCR offers a method to achieve this coordination. In our study, keeping the order of patients was associated with increased RN attendance and participation, but starting earlier or later than the set time was not associated with fluctuations in these metrics. The nurses worked closely with the case manager to be aware of when the team was running ahead or behind the set schedule. This awareness helps explain the maintenance of high attendance despite the 47% of encounters starting >5 minutes earlier or later than the scheduled time.",

Although the average rounding time/patient increased by 1 minute, it was value-added time because the checklist items were reliably discussed. Additionally, providers perceived less time spent between patients waiting for the nurse or interpreter, so rounds felt more efficient. The time invested in rounds may decrease clarifications from RNs or families afterward, which likely contributed to perceived efficiency. 5 Similar standardization approaches to rounds have shown to significantly increase both healthcare provider's satisfaction and quality of discussion during rounds. 16 We also found SBFCR improved overall satisfaction with rounds for providers. High engagement and satisfaction with the rounding process, which is a major component of the inpatient workday, can have a positive effect on patient outcomes while decreasing provider burnout. 17 Education is an essential component of the mission of teaching hospitals. Before starting SBFCR on the cardiology service, a major concern was that teaching would be negatively impacted due to the schedule's time constraints. Despite these concerns, our survey results revealed most faculty and trainees perceived an increase in teaching.",

As a single institution study on one unit's subspecialty service, findings may not be generalizable to a more heterogeneous patient population. However, we recently implemented the system on the general pediatric hospitalist service, whose patients are on several different units with excellent early results. Second, as this was a project done in phases, concurrent improvement initiatives, the Hawthorne effect, or unrecognized trends could impart biases. Third, the audit data collected by the case manager during rounds were not independently verified and did not capture between rounding wait time or any weekend data. Last, although we conducted surveys of providers and nurses before and after SBFCR, we did not use a validated tool to assess nurse-physician collaboration. 20 Not all trainees had experienced cardiology rounds before and after SBFCR, limiting the comparison concerning the perception of teaching. The RN survey did not directly solicit feedback on overall satisfaction with the SBFCR process and focused on the perceived benefits of attending rounds. In conclusion, SBFCR offers an innovative organizational framework to allow a team to accomplish the central tenets of family-centered rounding: medical decision making, clarifying care plans for the family and interdisciplinary team, care coordination, discharge preparation, and medical trainee teaching. Implementation of SBFCR increased RN attendance and participation during rounds at our institution, facilitated family presence at rounds, and improved provider satisfaction with rounds while preserving bedside education. Future studies should focus on the impact of SBFCR on patient safety and patient-family satisfaction. Fig. 4 . Provider and nurse satisfaction-Pre-SBFCR compared to Post-SBFCR.
