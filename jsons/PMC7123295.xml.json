The two most serious epidemics of recent times emerged from African tropical forests, namely AIDS and Ebola. Every region of the world has to deal with the threat and impact of disease, but Africa has been disproportionately impacted.",

The current advice is that HIV positive pregnant women remain on treatment for the rest of their lives.
