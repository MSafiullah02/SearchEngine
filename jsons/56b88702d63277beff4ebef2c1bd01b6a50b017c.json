            "text": "The epidemic spreading over a network has been studied for years by applying the mean-field approach in both homogeneous case, where each node may get infected by an infected neighbor with the same rate, and heterogeneous case, where the infection rates between different pairs of nodes are also different. Researchers have discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the epidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous cases. In this paper, we explore if and under what conditions the mean-field approach could perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular, we employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state, where the fraction of infected nodes remains stable for a long time, obtained by the continuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on an individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the underlying network topology. Moreover, for the heterogeneity of the infection rates, we consider not only the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate correlated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is generally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given the same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of the i.i.d. infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual prevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the i.i.d. infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive. Our work suggests the conditions when the mean-field approach, in particular NIMFA, is more accurate in the approximation of the SIS epidemic with heterogeneous infection rates.",

On such networks or complex systems, viral spreading models have been used to describe processes e.g. epidemic spreading and information propagation [8, 10, 13, 20] . The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is one of the most studied models. In the SIS model, each infected node infects each of its susceptible neighbors with an infection rate \u03b2 . The infected node can be recovered with a recovery rate \u03b4 . Both processes are independent Poisson processes. The ratio \u03c4 \u03b2 /\u03b4 is called effective infection rate, and when \u03c4 is larger than the epidemic threshold \u03c4 c , the epidemic spreads out with a nonzero fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state. The average fraction of infected nodes y \u221e in the metastable state, ranging in [0, 1], indicates how severe the influence of the virus is: the larger the fraction y \u221e is, the more severely the network is infected.",

            "text": "In this paper, we concentrate on deriving the average fraction y \u221e of infected nodes in the metastable state. Although the continuous-time Markov theory can be used to obtain the exact value of y \u221e , the number of states is too large to be solved in a large network [12] . Hence, the derivation of the average fraction y \u221e of infected nodes in the metastable state mostly relies on mean-field theoretical approaches. The first approach to study the SIS model in complex networks is a degree-based mean-field (DBMF) theory, also called heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) approximation, proposed by Pastor-Satorras et al. [14] , which assumes that all nodes with the same degree are statistically equivalent, i.e. the infection probabilities of those nodes are the same. An individual-based mean-field (IBMF) approximations, called the N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA), of the SIS model is then introduced [19] with the only assumption that the state of neighboring nodes is statistically independent. NIMFA, taking the network topology into account, turns out to be more precise on different types of networks for the classic SIS model with the homogeneous infection rates [7] while comparing to the DBMF approximation. However, as discussed in [4, 15, 22] , the infection rates could be heterogeneous, i.e. the infection rates between different pairs of nodes could also be different. The accuracy of NIMFA with heterogeneous infection rates has not yet been discussed.",

As discussed in [17] , such a correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is motivated by the real-world datasets. In this case, the infection rate of each link is determined by the given network topology and \u03b1. For the reference scenario, we shuffle the infection rates from all the links as generated in the first scenario and redistribute them randomly to all the links. In this way, we keep the distribution of infection rates but effectively remove the correlation between the infection rates and nodal degrees. For simplicity, we name this reference scenario as the uncorrelated infection-rate scenario. Though the i.i.d. infection rates are also uncorrelated, we can tune the variance of the infection rate in the case of the i.i.d. infection rates while keeping the distribution and the mean of the infection rates. However, in the scenario of uncorrelated infection rates in this paper, the distribution of the infection rate changes with the parameter \u03b1, hence the variance of the heterogeneous infection rates cannot be systematically tuned. A positive \u03b1 > 0 (or negative \u03b1 < 0), suggests a positive (or negative) correlation between infection rates and nodal degrees. Too large or small values of \u03b1 could not be realistic. For example, [3, 9, 11] suggest that \u03b1 is around 0.5 or 0.8 in their datasets. Hence, we select \u03b1 = \u22120.25, \u22120.5, \u22121 for the negative correlation and \u03b1 = 0.25, 0.5, 1 for the positive correlation.

We further employ the smallest degree d min = 2, the natural degree cutoff d max = N 1/(\u03bb \u22121) as in [6] , and the size N = 1000. Hence, the average degree is approximately 4.

In each iteration, the networks are constructed as described above and the infection rates are generated as described in Section 2.2 and 2.3. Initially, 10% of the nodes are randomly infected. Then the infection and recovery processes of SIS model are simulated until the system reaches the metastable state where the fraction of infected nodes is nonzero and unchanged for a long time if the epidemic spreads out, or the fraction is zero if the epidemic dies out. The average fraction y \u221e of infected nodes is obtained over 100 iterations (no matter the epidemic dies out or not).",

Hence, the higher heterogeneity, i.e. the larger variance, of the i.i.d. infection rates tends to lower down more the accuracy of NIMFA. Overall, we conclude that the prevalence of the epidemic mainly affects the accuracy of NIMFA, i.e. the higher the prevalence is, the more accurate NIMFA tends to be, and given the same prevalence, a larger variance of the i.i.d. infection rates tends to lower down the accuracy of NIMFA.

We first employ ER networks as an example and discuss the case when the correlation is positive. Afterwards we explore the influence of the negative correlation. As mentioned in Section 2.3, we build the scenario of uncorrelated infection rates as a reference to study the influence of the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree by shuffling the infection rates from all the links as generated in the scenario of correlated infection rates and redistributing them randomly to all the links. As shown in Fig. 3a , we compare the difference \u03b6 between NIMFA and simulations in the scenario of uncorrelated and correlated infection rates for both \u03b1 = 0.25 and \u03b1 = 1, and find that \u03b6 is smaller in the scenario of correlated infection rates, i.e. NIMFA is more accurate at a given effective infection rate \u03c4 when the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive comparing to the scenario of uncorrelated infection rates. The observations are also consistent with our conclusion that NIMFA is more accurate when the prevalence is higher: the positive correlation tends to increase the average fraction of infected nodes [17] , and thus the accuracy of NIMFA, when the effective infection rate \u03c4 is small; however, when the effective infection rate \u03c4 is large, though the positive correlate may lower down a bit the average fraction y \u221e of infected nodes, the prevalence in both scenarios is high, i.e. NIMFA is relatively accurate, and the difference of the accuracy of NIMFA in the two scenarios is not obvious. As the correlation strength \u03b1 increases in Fig. 3b , the difference \u03b6 decreases at a given \u03c4. That is to say, NIMFA tends to be more accurate when the positive correlation becomes stronger. We further consider the influence of the positive correlation on the accuracy of NIMFA when the prevalence is the same. The plots of the difference \u03b6 as a function of the average fraction y \u221e of infected nodes are shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d . Given the prevalence of epidemic, the positive correlation is more likely to increase the precision of NIMFA and the stronger the correlation is the more accurate NIMFA is. We observe the same on SF networks which is though not shown here.",

We find that, in general, the negative correlation significantly decreases the accuracy of NIMFA when the effective infection rate \u03c4 is small but may slightly increase that when \u03c4 is large. Moreover, NIMFA becomes less accurate when the negative correlation is stronger as shown in Fig. 4b .

When the prevalence of epidemic is the same, the influence of the negative correlation on NIMFA's accuracy is shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d . We find that, in general, 1) NIMFA is less accurate with the negative correlation comparing to the uncorrelated scenario especially when the prevalence is low as shown in Fig. 4c ; 2) NIMFA becomes even less accurate if the negative correlation becomes stronger as shown in Fig. 4d .",

We construct this network and its infection rates from the dataset of openFlights 1 . As shown in [17] , the airline network possess roughly a power-law degree distribution. The heterogeneous infection rates from the dataset are normalized by the average so that the average is 1. We compare the difference \u03b6 between NIMFA and the simulations of the exact SIS model in three scenarios: 1) the network is equipped with its normalized original heterogeneous infection rates (correlated) as given in the dataset; 2) the network is equipped with the infection rates in the normalized original dataset but randomly shuffled (uncorrelated); 3) the network is equipped with a constant infection rate (homogeneous) which equals to 1. The original heterogeneous infection rate between a pair of nodes are approximately correlated with the degrees of the two nodes as the relationship (5), and the parameter \u03b1 \u2248 0.14 indicates a positive correlation [17] . We show the difference \u03b6 as a function of the effective infection rate \u03c4 in Fig. 5a for the 3 scenarios defined as above. We find that NIMFA is generally more accurate when the effective infection rate \u03c4 is larger, i.e. the prevalence of epidemic is high. The variable \u03b6 is smaller in the scenario of homogeneous infection rates than uncorrelated infection rates with any effective infection rate. This is because the i.i.d. infection rates with a non-zero variance tends to decrease the prevalence, and thus lower down the accuracy of NIMFA at a given effective infection rate \u03c4. NIMFA is more accurate with the positive correlation by comparing the difference \u03b6 in the scenario of correlated infection rates and uncorrelated infection rates. Furthermore, Fig. 5b shows that, given the same actual prevalence, i.e. the average fraction y \u221e of infected nodes obtained by simulations, NIFMA is more accurate: 1) in the homogeneous scenario than in the uncorrelated scenario; 2) in the correlated scenario than in the uncorrelated scenario.

By comparing NIMFA with the continuous-time simulations of the exact SIS model at a give effective infection rate \u03c4, we find that the prevalence of epidemic could largely characterize the accuracy of NIMFA which is reflected in two aspects: 1) NIFMA is generally more accurate when the effective infection rate \u03c4 is larger, i.e. the prevalence of epidemic is higher; 2) when the variance of the i.i.d. infection rates or the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree decreases the prevalence at a given \u03c4, NIMFA tends to become less accurate as well. Moreover, we also explore the influence of the heterogeneous infection rates on the accuracy of NIMFA at a given prevalence, i.e. when the average fraction y \u221e of infected nodes obtained by simulations is given. Regarding to the i.i.d. heterogeneous infection rates, the accuracy of NIMFA tends to decrease as the variance of infection rates increases. In the scenario of correlated infection rates, the positive correlation between the nodal degree and the infection rate is more likely to increase the accuracy of NIMFA whereas the negative correlation tends to lower down the accuracy especially when the effective infection rate \u03c4 is small. Note that we discuss the conditions when NIMFA is accurate but the cases where NIMFA is far from the simulations are still unexplored. Our work sheds light on the conditions when we the mean-field approximation of the SIS model with heterogeneous infection rates is accurate.",
