There is an unmet need for alternative donors because only 18% of SCD patients have an HLA-matched sibling [3]. HSCT using HLA-matched unrelated donors is limited by the difficulty in finding HLA-compatible donors for this largely nonwhite patient population 4, 5. Additionally, a study reported high rates of chronic GVHD (62%) and transplant-related mortality (21%) in SCD patients receiving transplants from HLA-matched unrelated donors [6].",

This strategy was used in 14 SCD patients transplanted with bone marrow cells after conditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), antithymocyte globulin, and GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy on days +3 and +4; mycophenolate mofetil for 30 days; and tacrolimus or sirolimus for at least 1 year (the Hopkins protocol) [8]. No severe transplant-related complications were reported, and 57% of patients achieved a stable donor cell engraftment. In a subsequent study the same regimen resulted in the engraftment of only 2 of 5 SCD patients [9]. Modifications to this regimen, including the addition of azathioprine and hydroxyurea for 3 months pre-HSCT, hypertransfusion, and thiotepa on day \u20137, improved engraftment to 91%, with 18% acute GVHD and 14% mortality in a pediatric series of SCD patients [9].",

            "text": "In our experience of 50 adult SCD patients referred for HSCT, only 20% ended up receiving a haploidentical HSCT. Medical insurance denial accounted for 20% of the lack of access for HSCT. Other factors, such as high rates of DSAs in frequently transfused SCD patients and personal decisions to decline HSCT, also played significant roles. Our rate of available haploidentical donors is lower than was previously observed at Johns Hopkins University, where 90% of SCD patients referred had haploidentical donors [8]. This difference may be because many of the SCD patients reported on here were already being followed in our clinics and had not been prescreened or selected by referring physicians. The presence of DSAs is a major barrier to haploidentical HSCT in SCD that should be addressed when discussing treatment options with patients. A possible strategy to increase the donor pool could be to select patients with low DSA titers and a negative cross-match result. Desensitization protocols used in hematologic malignancies [11] should also be tested in clinical trials for SCD patients with clinically aggressive disease. Our findings are consistent with a previous report showing that a substantial proportion of eligible SCD patients do not proceed to HSCT because of fear of toxicity and satisfaction with the current quality of life [19]. The 2 main reasons that patients reported for declining HSCT were the risk of GVHD in an HLA-mismatched HSCT and the toxicity associated with chemotherapy in the conditioning regimen. Interestingly, in previous studies the severity of SCD was not associated with the degree of risk that a parent or a patient is willing to accept for cure 20, 21, 22, 23. Only 35% of adolescents and 46% of parents would accept HSCT if recommended by their hematologist [24]. Thirty-two percent of adolescents believe that SCD will shorten their life span, and only 26% believe that SCD will prevent the achievement of life goals, which is in contrast to 86% of adults who perceived that employment opportunities are affected by SCD 21, 24. There is a need for better education of patients about the course of SCD and for large, prospective haploidentical HSCT studies to guide the decisions of patients and their families for the risk-to-benefit assessment of HSCT. The risks of curative treatment with alternative donors will need to be carefully considered as new therapies, such as gene therapy [25] and nontransplant therapies [26], are being developed for SCD.",

In that case series 7 of 11 patients had serious adverse events with G-CSF use, and a lower HbS level did not reduce the rate of adverse events. In contrast, in a pediatric cohort of children with SCD undergoing matched related donor HSCT, G-CSF 5 \u00b5g/kg/day was safely given starting on day +7 until full neutrophil recovery [28]. Only 1 patient in our study had mild lower extremity pain while receiving G-CSF consistent with tolerability of G-CSF post-HSCT in SCD. Although sickle cell trait donors did not experience any severe side effects with G-CSF mobilization, an alternative strategy to mobilize stem cells in sickle cell trait donors and to mobilize autologous stem cells from SCD patients may be the use of plerixafor, as safely demonstrated in gene therapy studies [29].",
