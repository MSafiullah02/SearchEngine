Its influence reaches all organs and cell types, representing an integral component of approximately 10% of the human proteome, and encompassing hundreds of key enzymes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency is strikingly common, affecting up to a quarter of the population in developing countries, but also affecting distinct populations in the developed world as a result of lifestyle, age, and disease-mediated factors. Consequently, zinc status is a critical factor that can influence antiviral immunity, particularly as zinc-deficient populations are often most at risk of acquiring viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes current basic science and clinical evidence examining zinc as a direct antiviral, as well as a stimulant of antiviral immunity. An abundance of evidence has accumulated over the past 50 y to demonstrate the antiviral activity of zinc against a variety of viruses, and via numerous mechanisms. The therapeutic use of zinc for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and the common cold has stemmed from these findings; however, there remains much to be learned regarding the antiviral mechanisms and clinical benefit of zinc supplementation as a preventative and therapeutic treatment for viral infections.

Unbeknownst to Dr. Prasad and his colleagues at the time, their discovery would highlight the importance of zinc as an integral component of human physiology, and inspire decades of zinc research. It is now understood that zinc is the second-most abundant trace metal in the human body after iron, and an essential component of protein structure and function. Importantly, zinc is a structural constituent of \u223c750 zinc-finger transcription factors (2) enabling gene transcription, and is a catalytic component of approximately 2000 enzymes, encompassing all 6 classes (hydrolase, transferase, oxido-reductase, ligase, lyase, and isomerase) (3) . Hence, zinc is biologically essential for cellular processes, including growth and development, as well as DNA synthesis and RNA transcription (4) .",

            "text": "Metallothioneins are small, cysteine-rich proteins capable of binding divalent cations such as zinc and copper. As vessels for much of the labile intracellular zinc pool, metallothioneins possess numerous functions through their ability to bind and release metals from their thiol groups. These include storage and transfer of zinc ions and heavy metal detoxification, as well as involvement in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and immune responses (23) . Humans express 4 metallothionein isoforms (MT1-4), including the ubiquitously expressed MT1 and MT2 genes (MT1A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, X, MT2A), as well as MT3 and MT4 whose expression is limited, and function remains poorly understood (24) . Importantly, MT1 and 2 gene expression is extremely responsive to zinc, and therefore serves as an ideal indicator of an individual's zinc status (25) . Upon taking a zinc supplement, for example, an increase in protein-bound zinc in the bloodstream is internalized by cells in various tissues and organs through the ZIP transporters. In response to increased intracellular zinc, the metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF1) becomes active, and binds the metal responsive element in metallothionein gene promoters to upregulate their transcription (26) . Although there are additional stimuli that influence metallothionein expression, this primarily occurs in a zincdependent fashion. Oxidative stress, for example, induces zinc release from metallothioneins as a mechanism to reduce reactive oxygen species generated by mitochondrial dysfunction or viral infection (26) . Zinc released from metallothioneins binds MTF1 to stimulate additional metallothionein expression.",

IFNs are immunostimulatory cytokines secreted from infected cells and nearby immune cells that induce the expression of hundreds of antiviral genes. They possess diverse roles including chemoattraction, immune cell activation, and direct antiviral activity. In response to IFNs, we suggest that there are 2 mechanisms of metallothionein induction. Most ISGs possess binding sites for STAT-or IFN regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factormediated expression, as is the case for MT1X and MT2A (28, 29) . Other metallothioneins such as MT1F and MT1G do not possess known IFN regulatory regions in their promoters, but are instead more sensitive to zinc (28) . IFNs stimulate an influx of zinc into the target cell, as is the case with some inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, which in turn drives metallothionein expression.",

            "text": "Because metallothioneins possess such a diverse functional repertoire, their specific roles during viral infection remain undefined. However, both in vitro and in vivo studies have made it abundantly clear that metallothioneins are induced by viruses. The mechanisms often remain undefined; however, metallothionein expression has been attributed to zinc influx or redistribution (19, 28) , by viral means, cytokine exposure, or oxidative stress (30) . Metallothionein upregulation has been observed in response to measles virus (31) , influenza (31, 32) , HIV (33), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (34) , and coxsackie virus (35) , among others. In the case of HIV, zinc appears to be the key driver of metallothionein expression to favor viral persistence. HIVinfected monocytes demonstrate a significant increase in both MT1 gene expression as well as intracellular zinc (33) . Elevated intracellular zinc increases monocyte resistance to apoptosis via inhibition of caspase 3 activation [as has been reported previously (36) ], thus providing a reservoir for HIV replication. The role of metallothioneins remains unclear in this study; however, they have been described as negative regulators of apoptosis, albeit not through direct caspase 3 inhibition (37) . Zinc and metallothioneins also facilitate human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication by activating the immediate-early HCMV promoter (38, 39) . Kanekiyo et al. demonstrated that both zinc and metallothionein overexpression increased NF-\u03baB binding in the HCMV promoter. Because no complex was detected between metallothionein and NF-\u03baB, it was suggested that metallothioneins served as a zinc donor necessary for NF-\u03baB binding. In addition, as NF-\u03baB transcription factors are known potent activators of HIV and HSV replication, and several other viruses (40) , metallothioneins may be proviral. Zinc has also been reported to inhibit NF-\u03baB in numerous studies (41) (42) (43) . Despite these contrasting data, Kim et al. have bridged these inconsistencies, demonstrating that MT2A can serve as a sink for excess zinc (44) , thus limiting its proximity to NF-\u03baB and favoring NF-\u03baB-mediated transcription.",

Using a pan-metallothionein siRNA to knockdown all MT1 and 2 genes, we demonstrated both an increase in HCV replication and a decrease in intracellular zinc content in vitro (34) . Interestingly, although ZnSO 4 can reduce HCV replication, this effect was ablated when metallothionein genes were knocked down. These data suggest that metallothioneins are either 1) directly antiviral, potentially by sequestering zinc away from viral metalloproteins such as HCV NS5A (45), or 2) indirectly antiviral by acting as zinc chaperones and facilitating antiviral signaling. Further, metallothioneins possess antiviral properties against other viruses as well, as demonstrated in an antiviral screen of 380 human ISGs performed by Schoggins et al. (46) . Overexpression of multiple members of the MT1 family inhibited replication of flaviviruses including yellow fever virus and HCV, as well as the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. This effect was not observed in West Nile virus, and Chikungunya virus. These data indicate that metallothioneins, like many ISGs, are selectively antiviral, perhaps reflecting specific viral zinc requirements during replication. This is particularly evident for HIV, which demonstrated an increase in viral replication as a result of metallothionein overexpression in the Schoggins et al. ISG screen (46) , validating previous works (33) .",

Unfortunately, zinc concentrations used to assess antiviral activity often far exceed physiological concentrations. Human plasma zinc, for example, ranges from approximately 10 to 18 \u03bcM (47), whereas antiviral concentrations of zinc can reach into mM concentrations (48) . Intracellular zinc concentrations range from 10s to 100s of \u03bcM, but are significantly buffered by zinc-binding proteins such as metallothioneins, rendering free zinc concentrations at picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations (49, 50) . The antiviral properties of zinc are certainly virus-specific, but it would appear that zinc ion availability plays a significant role in the antiviral efficacy of zinc (51) . Here we describe the role of zinc as a virus-specific antiviral: both in vitro mechanistic studies, as well as human-based clinical trials using zinc supplementation. In vitro and in vivo studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.",

Although these studies were performed >20 y ago, a more recent study using the zinc ionophore pyrithione demonstrated a reduction in HSV replication from reduced NF-\u03baB activation by interfering with the protein ubiquitination pathway (41) . Unfortunately, no recent experimental data can demonstrate with any certainty the mechanism by which zinc inhibits HSV infection. Nonetheless, in vivo studies in mice and humans have shown a significant reduction of infection and disease burden. Mouse studies performing intravaginal zinc inoculation in liquid (55) or gel (56) form both resulted in significant reductions in HSV-2 infection. Several topical zinc application studies have been performed in humans, which demonstrated a significantly reduced recurrence and duration of infection (outbreak) (57) (58) . The efficacy of topical application, together with in vitro results (48, 54) , suggest that free zinc may indeed coat HSV virions, thus preventing infection. Further research into this molecular mechanism is warranted.",

Before 1980, zinc inhibition of picornovirus proteases from human rhinovirus isolates (73, 74) , encephalomyocarditis virus (62), poliovirus (61) , and foot and mouth disease virus (64, 65) had all been demonstrated. More recent studies using zinc ionophores have illustrated that zinc interferes with the autocatalytic processing of the viral protease 3CD pro into 3C pro in the picornavirus coxsackievirus B3, thus inhibiting processing of the viral polyprotein (107) . However, this was not the case for encephalomyocarditis virus, where zinc appeared to inhibit the tertiary structure within the viral polyprotein (107) . Together, these data suggest that zinc may interfere with proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein because of misfolding, or through direct actions on the viral protease 3CD pro . Clinical studies using zinc supplementation are primarily limited to rhinovirus infection, and are often grouped with other \"common cold\" viruses such as influenza and coronaviruses. The majority of studies use zinc lozenges with various zinc formulations and concentrations, possibly explaining the large variability in results [extensively reviewed in (108) and (109)]. Importantly, the amount of ionic zinc present at the site of infection (oral and nasal mucosa) is highly correlated to the study outcome (51, 108) , and is dependent on the zinc formulation. At a physiological pH and 37 \u2022 C, zinc gluconate for example, releases high amounts of ionic zinc, whereas zinc aspartate releases none (108) . Upon examining only the relevant studies where high doses of ionic zinc were used, a clear reduction in cold duration of 42% was calculated (109) . Whether this was caused by viral inhibition, improved local immune response, or an amelioration of symptoms remains uncertain.",

Using liposome (76) , red blood cell (115) , and BHK-21 (77) cell model systems, zinc has been shown to efficiently inhibit membrane fusion of Semliki Forest virus and sindbis viruses. Zinc ions interfere with membrane fusion by binding to a specific histidine residue revealed on the viral E1 protein at low endosomal pH (77) . Unfortunately, the in vivo relevance of this model is unclear because of the high concentration of zinc (>1 mM) used. Notably, concentrated zinc is present in vesicular zincosomes that are thought to serve as intracellular zinc storage vesicles (116) . Similar to the mechanism used by macrophages to inhibit intracellular Mycobacterium spp., zincosome fusion to viral endosomes may inhibit key aspects of the viral life cycle such as togavirus membrane fusion.",

The integrated provirus can then establish a latent infection for the life of the host and is a major barrier to virus cure strategies, particularly for HIV-1 (117) . Similar to viral RdRps, zinc has also been identified as an inhibitor of retrovirus RTs (118, 119) . Fenstermacher and DeStefano demonstrated in 2011 that Zn 2+ cations can displace Mg 2+ ions from HIV-1 RT, promoting the formation of an excessively stable, but incredibly slow and inefficient replication complex (70) . Zinc was also shown to inhibit the HIV-1 protease in 1991 (68) , and to inhibit viral transcription in 1999 (69), but has received little attention since, with the exception of molecular simulation experiments that identified the zinc-binding sites at the catalytic aspartate-25 residue (120). As stated above, HIV can also stimulate zinc influx into monocytes (33) , which may appear contradictory based on its antiretroviral properties. Latently infected monocytes and macrophages, however, can act as viral reservoirs for HIV (121) , and could therefore benefit from zinc-mediated inhibition of cell death. In fact, unlike the majority of CD4 + T cells, low levels of replication in macrophages do not result in cell death (122) , making them a viable reservoir, in addition to long-lived resting CD4 + T cells, for viral recrudescence after cessation of antiretroviral treatment.",

The inhibition of E6 and E7 by zinc results in apoptosis of cervical carcinoma cells, as they regain the function of tumor suppressors p53 and pRb (71) . The mechanism by which zinc downregulates E6 and E7 expression is unknown, but may be preceded by a zinc-driven blockade in another component of the viral life cycle.",

It should be noted, however, that individuals with persistent viral warts are often zincdeficient or have lower concentrations than their healthy counterparts (132) . In fact, studies demonstrating the most significant responses to zinc treatment had engaged patients that were primarily zinc-deficient (>70 \u03bcg/dL) (92, 94) . Nonetheless, 78% (94) and 100% (92) of patients showed clearance of lesions in response to oral zinc sulfate (10 mg/kg up to 600 mg/d) compared to 13% and 0% of the placebo group, respectively. Topical zinc formulations have also proved efficacious for treatment of viral warts. A small study using a 4-wk topical 10% zinc sulfate regimen for plane warts demonstrated an 86% response rate (6/7), compared to a 10% response rate (1/10) in the control group (93) .",

Zinc has been shown to contribute to a number of innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways that have been comprehensively reviewed recently (135) . As such, this review will focus specifically on the role of zinc in the immune response to viruses. Viral infections are recognized by a number of innate immune receptors termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These include the cell surface and endosomal Tolllike receptors (TLRs), as well as a variety of cytosolic PRRs such as RIGI, MDA5, and IFI16 that primarily bind viral nucleic acids (136) . Following ligand binding, PRRs share a number of downstream signaling intermediates, that ultimately activate both inflammatory (NF-\u03baB, AP1) and innate immune (IRF1/3/7) transcription factors. These transcription factors cooperate to induce expression of IFNs, of which there are 3 types: type I (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), type II (IFN-\u03b3 ), and type III (IFN-\u03bbs). Type I and III IFNs activate very similar antiviral signaling pathways; however, the type I IFN response is ubiquitous, whereas the type III IFN response is limited to a subset of immune cells, as well as epithelial cells of the liver, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary tracts (137) . Although both IFN types bind unique receptors, they activate a common signaling cascade where STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerize and bind IRF9, followed by translocation into the nucleus and subsequent binding of the IFN-sensitive response element that is present in hundreds of gene promoters. As stated previously, these ISGs possess numerous roles including immune cell chemotaxis and activation, as well as numerous antiviral mechanisms to inhibit viral replication within infected and neighboring cells.",

A recent study has demonstrated that intracellular zinc can reduce IFN secretion by destabilizing sortilin mRNA transcripts (147) . Sortilin is an endosomal protein that facilitates secretion of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL6 (148) , and its depletion results in a significant reduction in secretion of IFN-\u03b1.

Consequently, zinc may act to reinforce the shared IFN signaling cascade by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase enzymatic activity (152) . Following receptor engagement by IFNs, intracellular Janus protein tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 become phosphorylated, which in turn phosphorylate STAT molecules to stimulate ISG expression. By dephosphorylating these key signaling molecules, a number of phosphatases have been shown to \"put the brakes\" on IFN signaling. Phosphatases tyrosineprotein phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (SHP1), type 11 (SHP2), and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) have all been shown to inhibit JAK-STAT phosphorylation (153) (154) (155) , and are all inhibited by zinc ions, predominantly in the nanomolar range (156) (157) (158) . Interestingly, PP2A can also inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3, thus regulating antigen recognition by PRRs (159) . Conversely, the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) stimulates IRF3 activation by removing inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser97 (160) , and is also inhibited by zinc at nanomolar concentrations (161) . Zinc inhibits numerous pro-and antiviral phosphatases, with the net effect on virus recognition and response being undefined, which clearly requires further study.",

Interestingly, zinc-driven activation of the MTF-1 transcription factor can induce expression of SOCS-3 in HepG2 cells (163) . The zinc importer ZIP-14, which is responsible for zinc influx following inflammatory stimuli, was required for SOCS-3 expression, and may represent yet another zinc-mediated mechanism to limit the inflammatory response. Although the transporter responsible for hepatic zinc influx following IFN stimulation remains unknown, it is perceivable that ZIP-14 may drive zinc influx and subsequent SOCS-3 expression.",

Moreover, dietary phytate, a natural chelator of zinc ions that is present in corn, rice, and cereals, can severely restrict zinc absorption (165) .

As described above, zinc supplementation can improve HCV treatment response and liver inflammation caused by chronic infection. In addition, long-term zinc treatment over 7 y has been shown to reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma progression in chronic HCV patients, as assessed by multivariate analysis, compared to controls (P < 0.05) (105) . Zinc supplementation has also been assessed as an adjunct therapy to antiretroviral administration in patients with HIV. One study reported a 4-fold reduction in the rate of immune failure, as well as decreased diarrhea in patients treated with zinc compared to controls (P < 0.05 for both groups) (124) . A more recent study revealed an increase in CD4 + T cell count in patients treated with a combination of zinc and antiretroviral therapy, compared to patients on antiretroviral therapy alone (P < 0.05) (177) . Taken together, these data indicate that zinc deficiency is associated with greater disease activity in the context of chronic viral infection.

            "text": "The tight regulation of zinc homeostasis both systemically and intracellularly indicates that zinc plays an essential role in human health. Although zinc is a component of \u223c10% of the human proteome, zinc in different forms (free compared with protein-bound) can stimulate a variety of signaling events, including the antiviral response. In vitro studies suggest that free zinc may possess potent antiviral effects, and are supported by trials of creams, lozenges, and supplements with high free zinc content. Moreover, zinc-binding proteins such as the metallothioneins may possess antiviral roles, although their specific function remains uncertain. Nonetheless, zinc treatment applied at a therapeutic dose and in the right form has the potential to drastically improve the clearance of both chronic and acute viral infections, as well as their accompanying pathologies and symptoms. Consequently, the role of zinc as an antiviral can be separated into 2 categories: 1) zinc supplementation implemented to improve the antiviral response and systemic immunity in patients with zinc deficiency, and 2) zinc treatment performed to specifically inhibit viral replication or infection-related symptoms (75, 78-82, 83, 85-91, 95-101, 103, 104) .",

In vitro studies have demonstrated a number of mechanisms by which zinc interferes with the viral replication cycle.

No studies to date, however, have demonstrated zinc-mediated inhibition of virus assembly and/or particle release.
