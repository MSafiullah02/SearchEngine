The substrate on which such display takes place is greatly deterministic of functionality and applicability. Common, well-established techniques include display on cell surfaces, ribosomes, and phage particles (Lee et al. 2003; Zahnd et al. 2007; Rakonjac et al. 2011). The use of microbial biopolymers as substrates has more recently been revealed in a variety of contexts. Although bacteria can produce a range of polymers, only a few of them have been considered for display technologies (Fig. 1). Bacterial cellulose, which exhibits various properties superior to plant-based cellulose with respect to display technology applications, has been limited to enzyme, bacterial cell and fungi immobilization (Wu and Lia 2008; Ullah et al. 2016). In contrast, bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been extensively investigated as substrates for display technology applications, and thus will be the focus of this chapter.\n",

During excess carbon availability, they are stockpiled as the amorphous core of PHA inclusions, surrounded by structural proteins (phasins), PHA metabolism-associated enzymes, and regulator proteins (Grage et al. 2009; Jendrossek 2009). Critical enzymes for PHA synthesis and inclusion assembly are the PHA synthases (such as PhaC) which catalyze the stereoselective conversion of the activated precursor (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA (Rehm 2003). These CoA thioesters, depending on their carbon chain length, are synthesized from intermediates of fatty acid metabolism or directly from acetyl-CoA to polyoxoesters with the simultaneous release of coenzyme A (Steinbuchel et al. 1993; Rehm 2006) (Fig. 2). Unlike the other hydrophobically interacting PHA inclusion surface proteins, the PHA synthase remains covalently linked to the PHA inclusion core (Hezayen et al. 2002; Peters and Rehm 2006).\n",

Melting points can range from 50 \u00b0C to 180 \u00b0C and crystallinity can range from 30% to 70%, which is largely determined by monomer composition (Rehm 2010). As such, PHAs have been classified on the basis of monomer chain length. Medium-chain-length PHAs (MCL, C6-C14) are naturally produced primarily by pseudomonads, whereas short-chain-length PHAs (SCL, C3-C5) production is more widespread throughout bacteria and archaea (Anderson et al. 1990) (Fig. 2). While the common laboratory bacterium does not naturally accumulate PHAs, it becomes a competent PHA producer upon introduction of the appropriate PHA biosynthesis genes (Schubert et al. 1988; Lee et al. 1994). The intracellular PHA inclusions may be isolated for polymer extraction and purification for processing into various materials, or maintained as functional shell-core beads (Fig. 3). The latter requires engineering of proteins attached to the PHA core in order to obtain functionality.\n",

Under serum-free conditions, confocal laser scanning microscopy in combination with cell counting assays revealed a significant cell attachment increase on the PhaP-RGD-coated PHA films relative to the PhaP- (nonfused) and noncoated films, in a manner that is unlikely to be attributable to changes in PHA surface topology. Further cell proliferation assays revealed increased fibroblast proliferation levels on PhaP-RGD-coated PHA films. Thus, PHA surface functionalization, using a well-known cell adhesion motif, was demonstrated using aqueous solutions, avoiding toxicity of chemical immobilization techniques. Continuing this pattern of investigation, similar increases in cell adhesion and cell proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells (HvSMCs) were demonstrated using the PHA repressor protein (PhaR) fused to the specific integrin ligand peptide (KQAGDV) (Dong et al. 2012), and, more recently, PhaP fused to RGD or the laminin-derived IKVAV peptides used to coat PHA films demonstrated enhanced neural stem cell (NSC) attachment, proliferation, and better neurite outgrowths, without effecting NSC differentiation (Xie et al. 2013).\n",

Generally, antigen-displaying beads are used to bind antibodies which are then detected via fluorescent-signaling secondary antibodies when the bead suspension passes through the FACS machine flow cell. Current bead preparation techniques involve tedious antigen purification and chemical crosslinking. Therefore, more cost-effective, reliable means of producing antigen-displaying beads with comparable detection efficacy could greatly impact the accessibility of FACS. A series of studies have shown that one path towards such improvement may be via one-step production of surface protein engineered PHA beads.",

The authors generated fusions between either interleukin-2 (IL2) or the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and the C- or N-terminus of PhaP via an enterokinase (specific protease) recognition site providing linker. Subsequently, the hybrid genes were expressed in E. coli and the PHA granules extracted. The resultant antigen-displaying PHA beads were then used for FACS using the corresponding fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibody which showed significant and specific antibody binding. Enterokinase treatment reversed this recognition indicating removal of the fusion partners/antigens. Finally, sera from mice immunized with MOG or ovalbumin (as a negative control) were analyzed using the MOG-displaying beads and FACS. Again, high specificity and sensitivity (antibody detection in sera diluted 1:100,000) were demonstrated, providing strong support for application of engineered PHA beads in FACS (Fig. 5). A subsequent investigation explored C-terminal PhaC-streptavidin fusions (Peters and Rehm 2008). The remarkably high streptavidin-biotin binding affinity has given rise to its use in range of biotechnological applications, thus making it a great candidate for further demonstrating the applicability of PHA beads in FACS. The study revealed a biotin binding capacity of 61 ng per \u03bcg of bead protein and demonstrated the detection of goat polyclonal biotinylated IgG in FACS using a secondary conjugated antibody. Most recently, PHA inclusions with GFP and MOG fused to PhaP or PhaC, such that each granule is simultaneously displaying two protein-based functionalities, were examined in the context of FACS, providing proof-of-concept for the biotechnological application of bifunctional PHA beads which may extend beyond FACS (Atwood and Rehm 2009).\n",

The major disadvantage of the currently widespread tuberculin skin test is the lack of detection specificity for pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex members, that is, cattle exposed to nonpathogenic, environmental mycobacteria may result in false-positives. Thus, with the aims of improving specificity and lowering production cost, an alternative test was developed. Three immunodominant TB antigens, which are absent in most environmental mycobacteria, were fused to PhaC mediating production of triple-antigen-displaying PHA beads. These granules showed in vitro increased reactivity with antigen-specific TB antibodies when compared with granules displaying only one antigen. Assessment of triple-antigen-displaying PHA beads in the skin test (in vivo) showed specificity as all cattle experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis were detected while no false-positive reactions in cattle previously exposed to environmental mycobacteria were observed. A fourth antigen was added to the triple-antigen-displaying PHA beads to boost skin test sensitivity (Parlane et al. 2016). Dose response studies showed that very low amounts of mycobacterial antigens (\u22650.1 \u03bcg) were already sufficient for the skin test suggesting greatly increased immunogenicity of antigen-displaying beads versus soluble antigens. Hence, it was demonstrated that antigen-displaying PHA beads mediate an antigen-specific immune reaction upon injection into the skin, that is, serve as specific immune response stimulating antigen delivery systems.",

Since PHAs are considered as biomaterials, when produced coated with pathogen-specific antigens they might serve as safe and efficient particulate vaccine. In general, the nano-/microsized particulate nature of a vaccine mimics the dimensions of a pathogen which boosts immunogenicity via enhanced uptake by antigen presenting cells (APC) (Shah et al. 2014). Immunodominant antigens from pathogens such as HCV and M. tuberculosis were displayed on PHA beads using PHA synthase engineering (Parlane et al. 2009, 2011). Purified antigen-coated PHA beads were injected into mice which resulted in strong and specific immune responses mediating protective immunity as assessed by challenge of vaccinated animals with the pathogen (Parlane et al. 2012; Martinez-Donato et al. 2016) (Fig. 6). It is noteworthy that these PHA bead-based vaccines stimulated both a humoral antibody (Th2) and cell-mediated (Th1) immune response, the latter being particularly relevant to protect against intracellular pathogens and is more challenging to achieve.\n\n",

Over the past 10 years, various approaches have been undertaken to make use of PHA and PHA-associated proteins for the development of alternative, simple and cost-effective protein purification systems. The general principle that most of these studies have followed is to produce the target protein as a translational fusion to a PHA inclusion-associated protein in cells that also make PHA and to then copurify the protein with the PHA beads. This can be done in a host that naturally produces PHA or in an organism that has been genetically engineered to make PHA (e.g., E. coli). Different methods have then been applied to release the target protein from the beads. Early examples used the phasin protein PhaP as an affinity tag and inducible self-cleaving inteins inserted between PhaP and the target protein to release the protein of interest. This method was applied by Barnard and coworkers to purify green-fluorescent protein (GFP) and \u03b2-galactosidase (LacZ) from Ralstonia eutropha, a natural PHB producer (Barnard et al. 2005). GFP and LacZ could be successfully purified fused to either end of PhaP using a thiol-inducible intein. Similarly, several proteins (maltose-binding protein (MBP), LacZ, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and NusA) were tagged with PhaP and purified from recombinant E. coli with the help of a pH-inducible intein (Banki et al. 2005).",

Release of the target protein was also achieved via intein-mediated self-cleavage. While this method is more labor-intensive than producing PHA and proteins in the same cell, advantageous might be the possibility to produce the tagged target protein in any host organism including eukaryotes. A simplified approach used the N-terminal part of PhaF to anchor a target protein to PHA beads in vivo, followed by bead isolation and release of the target protein (i.e., the entire fusion of target protein and PhaP) from the beads by detergent treatment (Moldes et al. 2004).",

Hence PHA beads have also been engineered to serve as affinity resins for bioseparation, generally exploiting the possibility of densely displaying binding domains on nano-/microbeads. These resins can be produced in one step by fusing the binding domain of choice to the bead-associated protein and then isolating these functionalized beads from the production host (similar to the protein purification approach described above). The first example of this was the immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding ZZ domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A translationally fused to PhaC (Brockelbank et al. 2006). The resulting ZZ domain displaying beads were isolated from E. coli and successfully purified IgG from human serum and mouse hybridoma supernatants, with purity and yield comparable to commercially available protein A sepharose (Brockelbank et al. 2006; Lewis and Rehm 2009).",

After secretion and recovery from the culture supernatant, the hLBP-PhaP fusion was incubated with beads processed from extracted PHA, and the resulting hLBP-beads were tested for their endotoxin removal abilities under a variety of conditions.

This study demonstrated that VHH domains from camelid antibodies, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) and OB-folds (OBodies), could be densely displayed on PHA beads resulting in high affinity binding resins for purification of various target proteins. These binding domains were used to establish extensive libraries of variants enabling screening for binders specific for the target compound of interest (Binz et al. 2004; Harmsen and De Haard 2007; Stumpp et al. 2008; Steemson et al. 2014). PHA-based affinity resins showed a purification performance at least equal to current commercial offerings (Hay et al. 2015b). A recent surface topology study of the R. eutropha PhaC attached to PHA inclusions suggested new engineering strategies towards the development of PHA-based affinity resins with increased binding capacity via improved display (Hooks and Rehm 2015). This study identified several surface-exposed flexible regions of PhaC, which tolerated the insertion of the IgG-binding ZZ domain. One of the double ZZ domain insertions (i.e., ZZ inserted in two of the surface-exposed regions) showed greatly improved IgG binding capacity with some of the single insertions also showing improved IgG binding capacity when compared with terminal fusions. Overall, PhaC engineering such as N- or C-terminal fusions and/or insertions enabled efficient display of binding domains for interaction with target compounds resulting in purification performance suitable for application as bioseparation resin.\n",
