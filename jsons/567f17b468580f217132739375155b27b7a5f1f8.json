The univariate analysis revealed a correlation between the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in camel farm workers and cleaning farm equipment (P = .05), assisting in animal birth (P = .08), milking animals (P = .03), and training animals (P = .01). Cleaning farm equipment might represent an increased risk of MERS-CoV exposure through contact with camel saliva, feces, and/or urine on soiled equipment [6, 7] . All animal workers that were involved in calvings also milked camels more than once per week. The relative high number of workers with MERS-CoV antibodies who assisted in the birth of camels and in milking animals may be explained by intensive contact with young camels. Although newborn calves are still protected by maternal antibodies, workers who assist in animal birth or milking often remain in close contact with mothers and their calves beyond the period of maternal protection [8] . For example, milking requires the presence of suckling young camels who trigger milk flow [9] . Moreover, camel milk can contain MERS-CoV RNA [9] . An association between MERS-CoV illness and milking has been described before [10] . Camel training, which requires close contact between the animal and its trainer, also seemed to increase the risk for MERS-CoV infection in camel workers. This is in agreement with previous reports that indicated that close contact with camels can be a risk factor for MERS-CoV illness or the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies [5, 10, 11] . In our cohort, we found a greater frequency of MERS-CoV seropositivity among workers who indicated that the camels they handled had recently traveled abroad within the Arabian Peninsula. Movement of animals to and from the Dukhan farm area occur with high frequency, owing to races, trade, and breeding activities, and can contribute to continuous local MERS-CoV circulation and human exposure due to both a continuous introduction of naive animals and/or acutely infected camels. Two out of 3 workers who reported international movements of their camels also reported personal travel to Saudi Arabia in the past 6 months. It is possible that these workers were exposed to MERS-CoV during their personal travel, rather than via the camels they worked with.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 574, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 575, "end": 577, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1069, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1165, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1217, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1302, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1633, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1637, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1641, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another association that was found was between the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies and overnight hospitalization because of respiratory complaints.

Prevention of MERS-CoV infection or exposure by handwashing possibly indicates that MERS-CoV can be indirectly transmitted via fomites. Infectious MERS-CoV could still be detected on surfaces after 1 day at 30\u00b0C and in milk after 2 days at 22\u00b0C in experimental conditions [12, 13] . Contact with camel excretions and subsequent touching of mucous membranes may be an important source of infection. Nasal secretions have been shown more frequently to contain MERS-CoV and have higher viral loads as compared to camel urine, feces, and saliva [6] . Human-to-human transmission may also take place via fomites. This can explain why many individuals with a primary case of MERS-CoV infection have not reported direct camel contact and, in some cases, have reported a household member who recently visited a camel farm [10, 14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 469, "end": 473, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 738, "end": 741, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1015, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1019, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While providing some interesting observations, this study has several limitations. First, owing to the number of respondents, the power of the study is limited. Therefore, we could only perform univariate analyses and very limited multivariate analyses to demonstrate significant associations between possible risk factors and MERS-CoV antibody presence in the respondents. Moreover, the retrospective study design may have resulted in significant recall bias among participants with regard to their and their camels' activities and health in the last 12 months. Because workers share housing and sleeping areas, MERS-CoV may have spread from human to human. This means that not all seropositive workers may have been infected directly by camels, which may affect the analysis.
