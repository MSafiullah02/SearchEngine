These experimental vaccines comprise an array of both innovative and traditional technologies, ranging from packaged nucleic acids and virus vectors to recombinant proteins combined with adjuvants 1 . The design of these vaccines builds on human immunology data collected since 2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged in southern China, together with almost two decades of studies conducted in experimental animals and in vitro models.",

Because transferred plasma from patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV may reduce mortality, many investigators now pursue the S protein or the RBD as vaccine targets. Indeed, studies conducted in a range of experimental animals, including transgenic mice expressing human ACE2, ferrets and non-human primates, confirm that such vaccines confer protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge infections.",

However, our in-depth literature analysis suggests that T H 17 responses may direct these cellular responses 6 , following immunization with inactivated viruses and vaccines delivered in virus vectors, and other key elements. In part, this evidence includes the link between T H 17 cell development and IL-6, a cytokine strongly upregulated in patients with COVID-19 who experience cytokine storm (together with IL-8 induction). Further support comes from the role of IL-17 in promoting the activation, recruitment from bone marrow and extravasation of eosinophils into target organs, such as the lungs 7 , and the finding that alum, an adjuvant that promotes T H 2-type immunity, actually reduces immunopathology 5 . Such observations highlight the potential importance of selecting vaccine delivery platforms and adjuvants that shift host responses away from a T H 17-type immune bias.",

Perhaps the best known example of ADE occurs following infection with multiple dengue virus serotypes, first reported by Halstead and O'Rourke in the 1970s and now influencing the design of new dengue vaccines. However, ADE may also influence the clinical course of several important human respiratory virus infections. For example, an observational study found that the 2008-2009 trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine might have caused enhanced disease during H1N1 pandemic flu, although another study actually found the opposite. Immune-enhanced disease resulting from the formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in the 1960s may also partially result from ADE, possibly from non-neutralizing antibody to virus antigens that were altered by the formalin, although it is also possible that the T H 17-type responses highlighted above might also be relevant.",

Whether or not a heterologous vaccine might enhance the risk of ADE is unclear. For example, ADE has been noted in experimental animals vaccinated with heterologous inactivated viruses, possibly due to non-neutralizing antibodies.

Two, conversely, alum reduces cellular infiltration, while ADE in vitro is linked to both non-neutralizing antibodies outside the S protein RBD, as well as neutralizing antibodies. While we do not have strong evidence that such in vitro studies or animal challenge models are predictive of clinical safety, they point to the promise of subunit vaccines including the RBD and alum adjuvants.
