It has since been recognized worldwide, and in at the United States and Japan is the most important cause of acquired heart disease in children, surpassing other more recognized conditions such as rheumatic fever, endocarditis and myocarditis. It is primarily a disease of children less than 5 years of age but has been reported in older children and adults. Risk factors for the illness include Asian ancestry, male gender and certain familial predispositions. Observations such as similarity to certain exanthematous infectious diseases, temporal-geographic clustering of cases and seasonality in incidence favors an infectious etiology. Pathology and pathogenesis of the disease indicate that it is a medium-sized artery vasculitis that results from a dramatic immune activation that in most cases reversed by immune modulating agents such as intravenous immunoglobulin. Unfortunately, the etiology of the illness remains obscure, although recent studies favor a possible viral etiology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Doctor Tomisaku Kawasaki first described Kawasaki disease (KD) in 1967 based on 50 cases he had observed over the preceding 6 years at the Tokyo Red Cross Hospital [1] . He termed the illness mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome because of characteristic changes of the mucous membranes and skin, which seemed to characterize the illness. During the first few years following its description, it appeared to be a self-limited disease without sequelae. However, following the first nationwide survey of the illness in Japan in 1970, sudden death due to coronary artery disease was firmly linked to the illness [2]. KD was independently described in the United States in 1974 by Melish and colleagues [3] , and following consultation with Dr. Kawasaki , there was agreement that the illnesses were clinically the same. Following the recognition of cardiac complications in both Japan and the United States, pathologists in both countries observed similarities between coronary artery lesions seen in KD patients and those in patients who had died of infantile periarteritis nodosa (IPN), a rare vasculitis of infancy [3] . The question arose as to whether the two were the same disease. The issue was resolved by Landing and Larson in 1976 [4] , who performed blinded evaluations of autopsy cases of children from both Japan and the United States who had died with a diagnosis of KD and IPN.

A polyclonal response to an SA might engender infant B cells to respond with a predominantly IgM reaction. A viral or other microbe presented to a mucosal site in a similar patient might stimulate vigorous IgA response [111] . Also observed was a heavy infiltration of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the upper respiratory tract of KD patients as compared to controls [112] . Subsequently, the same investigators demonstrated that the vascular IgA response was oligoclonal in nature and, therefore, probably resulted from stimulation by a conventional antigen, not a superantigen [112] . As a next step, the group developed synthetic antibody from prevalent IgA gene sequences found in acute-phase KD arterial tissue. They then exposed the tissues to the antibody and detected antigen in the respiratory epithelium of proximal bronchi from lungs and in subsets of invading macrophages from the myocardium of other inflamed tissues. The strength of the antigen signal paralleled the concentration of IgA plasma cell infiltration. These findings were not present in tissue from non-KD control patients [113] . Spheroid bodies were seen in the region between the nucleus and apical surface of ciliated epithelium of the proximal bronchi. Similar bodies were seen in the splenic and lymph node tissues.
