To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group. Conclusions: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs than participants taking placebo. Precautionary measures should be taken when using these drugs to treat Due to the lack of large clinical trials and small numbers of RCTs, we decided to include all the RCTs reporting adverse events (AEs) in patients with different disease conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, infectious diseases such as HIV infection, and immune diseases such as Primary Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome. We included all RCTs in adult patients that compared CQ or HCQ with other active agents or placebo.",

            "text": "The 2019 coronavirus disease is caused by the novel, highly infectious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since its discovery in December of 2019 in Wuhan, it has now caused a global pandemic. As of March 25, 2020 , there were 414,179 confirmed cases and 18,440 deaths from the disease, which brings the mortality to approximately 4.5%. 1 Thus, scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and medical professionals have united their efforts to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Although it is estimated that vaccine development will take at least 12-18 months, 2 two medications-chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-have emerged as strong contenders to treat the novel COVID-19. CQ and HCQ are antimalarial drugs clinically used to treat inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 3 Emerging evidence has suggested that these drugs are effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 4, 5 Viral replication begins when the virus attaches to the host cell and penetrates the cell. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it uses its surface unit (S1) of the S protein to attach to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which facilitates viral entry. 6 When African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells were pretreated for an hour with CQ or HCQ prior to four different multiplicities of infection by SARS-CoV-2, both drugs prevented viral entry as well as post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 4 Inhibition of viral entry may be due to interference of terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor. 5 Additionally, CQ and HCQ can alkalinize the phagolysosome, which disrupts the pH-dependent steps of viral fusion and uncoating-processes that are absolutely essential for viral replication. 7 Moreover, both CQ and HCQ have immunomodulatory properties 3 that may be beneficial in extreme, life-threatening COVID-19 cases. Indeed, there has been a recent surge in COVID-19 patients with severe hyper immune activity, known as the cytokine storm syndrome . 8 In this patient population, immunosuppression is likely to be beneficial, since the over-active immune response is paradoxically causing more harm than benefit to the patients. Therefore, CQ and HCQ have recently became appealing due to their antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help treat COVID-19, especially under dire circumstances.",

Currently, the safety profiles of these drugs are not entirely known due to the lack of large clinical trials, as well as sparse randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Moreover, the drugs have a narrow therapeutic range, which presents another challenge when using these drugs. 11, 12 Despite these shortcomings, combining the existing data on these drugs can provide powerful and valuable insight regarding their safety profiles, which will not only drive future clinical trials, but also help health professionals make informed decisions.",

Moreover, QT interval prolongation has been noted in numerous studies. [19] [20] [21] [22] Severely prolonged QT interval can lead to lethal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the prevalence of these cardiovascular AEs warrants periodic electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring when participants are undergoing these therapies, as cardiovascular AEs can be fatal.

CQ was used to treat various other conditions in trials with higher duration (\u22651 week). Upon closer inspection of the HCQ duration subgroup analysis, we observed that studies with duration <6 months had an insignificant overall RR of total AEs, while studies with duration \u22656 months had a very significant overall RR of total AEs (p<0.01). However, when these two groups were compared (p=0.18), there was no significant difference between them. Indeed, given the long halflife of HCQ, 29 it is plausible that the longer the duration of dosing regimen, the more total AEs may be observed. However, due to the small number of RCTs for HCQ, it is not possible to determine the duration when HCQ would produce more AEs.",

Reports were identified through Pubmed, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used the same process of study collection for both CQ and HCQ. We performed an initial screening, followed by a more stringent screening using our selection criteria. The studies that remained after all the exclusion were the ones used for data extraction. In total, we identified 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, which are described in Tables 1 and 2 . Of those studies, 6 CQ and 14 HCQ reports are placebo-controlled RCTs, so we used these studies for our data analysis. Figure 2 . Mild, severe, total AEs, and withdrawals due to AE from trials involving CQ and HCQ. We performed 6 comparisons between CQ and placebo and 14 comparisons between HCQ, as evident in the forest plots.

We tested heterogeneity between trials, as well as overall effect. Statistical data are displayed in the forest plots. shows the data for HCQ.
