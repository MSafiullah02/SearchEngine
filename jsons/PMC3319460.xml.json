            "text": "Lassa fever is an acute and often fatal illness endemic to regions of West Africa, including the countries of Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Recently, the importation of cases into non-endemic areas has been of increasing concern. Imported cases of Lassa fever have been reported in the United States, Europe and Canada (Lassa fever, 2000a, Lassa fever, 2000b, Lassa fever, 2000c, Imported Lassa fever, 2004, Atkin et al., 2009, Kitching et al., 2009, Mahdy et al., 1989). It is estimated that 300,000\u2013500,000 cases of Lassa fever occur each year (Fisher-Hoch and McCormick, 2004, McCormick, 1987, McCormick et al., 1987b), with mortality rates of 15%\u201320% in hospitalized patients (Buchmeier et al., 2007). The etiologic agent of Lassa fever is Lassa virus (LASV), a member of the Arenaviridae family of RNA viruses. This family is divided into the Old World viruses (e.g., LASV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, or LCMV) and the New World viruses (e.g., Jun\u00edn, Machupo, Guanarito and Sabi\u00e1). The natural host for Lassa virus is the peridomestic multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis). Transmission to humans occurs most often through contact with infected rodent excreta. Lassa fever poses a particular threat to health care workers in endemic areas, as nosocomial infections have occurred in nearly every recorded outbreak (Fisher-Hoch et al., 1995, Isa\u00e4cson, 2001). The incubation period for Lassa fever is approximately 10 days (with a range of 3\u201321 days) (Bausch et al., 2001, Frame et al., 1970, McCormick et al., 1987a, Mertens et al., 1973, Monath et al., 1974). The early stages of disease are characterized by the onset of general flu-like symptoms (headache, malaise, etc.), thus making a specific early diagnosis of Lassa fever difficult, as many diseases present in a similar manner in the endemic areas. Gastrointestinal manifestations are common and sore throat typically accompanied by inflammatory or exudative pharyngitis is observed in two out of three of patients (Buchmeier et al., 2007, McCormick et al., 1987a). Complications of Lassa fever have been reported in the literature and include mucosal bleeding, and pleural or pericardial effusion (McCormick et al., 1987a). Bleeding tendencies are observed in less than one third of patients but are an indicator of poor outcome, as is the development of severe edema (Buchmeier et al., 2007, Enria et al., 2006, Frame, 1989). Unilateral or bilateral deafness associated with infection-related damage to the eighth cranial nerve is a lasting complication in approximately one-third of patients released from the hospital after recovering from Lassa fever (Cummins, 1992, Cummins et al., 1990, Liao et al., 1992).",

            "text": "There are currently no FDA-licensed vaccines, therapeutics or immunotherapies developed specifically for preventing or treating Lassa fever. In addition to supportive care, the primary treatment option is administration of intravenous ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy in high-risk patients when administered early in the disease (McCormick et al., 1986). Typically, patients with Lassa fever in the endemic areas do not present to a hospital until late in disease progression, diminishing the likelihood of successful ribavirin treatment. Ribavirin causes hemolytic anemia which is often dose-limiting (Fuster et al., 2005) and is extremely teratogenic in animal models. In addition, ribarivin combination therapies have been associated with acute hematological, mitochondrial, pulmonary, hepatocellular and bone marrow toxicity, especially in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (Bani-Sadr et al., 2005, Drapeau et al., 2008, Fuster et al., 2005, Kumar et al., 2002, Mira et al., 2007). Frequently, these complications are severe enough to force dose reduction or cessation of treatment, thus viable alternative treatments are necessary (Fuster et al., 2005).",

Vaccine candidates include live attenuated, reassortant, yellow fever virus-based, and vesicular stomatitis virus-based platforms (Bredenbeek et al., 2006, Carrion et al., 2007b, Fisher-Hoch and McCormick, 2004, Geisbert et al., 2005, Lukashevich et al., 2005). Potential therapeutics against arenavirus infections include such novel therapies as small interfering RNA (siRNA) particles, antiviral compounds, and small-molecule inhibitors of virus entry and/or replication. M\u00fcller et al. recently demonstrated that siRNA particles were able to inhibit a LASV replicon system in vitro (M\u00fcller and G\u00fcnther, 2007). A pyrazine derivative, T-705, is currently in clinical trials against influenza virus and has shown efficacy against arenavirus infection in vitro and in vivo (Gowen et al., 2007, Gowen et al., 2008). This novel broad-spectrum antiviral demonstrated late-stage efficacy in a Pichinde virus hamster model (a biosafety level-2 surrogate for LASV infection), though the mechanism is unknown (Gowen and Holbrook, 2008, Gowen et al., 2008). T-705 has yet to be tested against LASV.",

            "text": "Another strategy is to target viral entry into cells, a process mediated by the virus-encoded envelope glycoprotein. The characteristics of the arenavirus glycoprotein are consistent with a class I envelope protein, which is typified by the influenza hemagglutinin and found also in retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses (Colman and Lawrence, 2003, Eschli et al., 2006, York et al., 2005). The glycoprotein precursor (GPC) is processed initially by a signal peptidase to produce an unusual stable signal peptide and subsequent posttranslational cleavage by the host cell protease SKI-1/S1P yields glycoprotein 1 (GP1) and glycoprotein 2 (GP2) subunits (Agnihothram et al., 2007, Lenz et al., 2001). GP1 serves a role in receptor binding, while GP2 contains structural motifs consistent with the fusogenic subunit of other class I envelope proteins that facilitate host cell entry via acid-dependent membrane fusion (Borrow and Oldstone, 1992, Burns and Buchmeier, 1991, Di Simone and Buchmeier, 1995, Gallaher et al., 2001, Wright et al., 1990). Attempting to interfere with LASV GPC processing or viral entry mediated by the GP1 or GP2 subunits represents a viable antiviral strategy. Two groups have recently described small-molecule inhibitors of LASV entry (Larson et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2008). At least one of these compounds, ST-193, appears to target the GP2 subunit of the envelope glycoprotein (Larson et al., 2008). In this study, we assessed the in vivo efficacy of ST-193 in a guinea pig model of Lassa fever.",

Both ST-193 and ribavirin were solubilized in 32% (w/v) 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, which was also used without drug as the vehicle control. Animals were anesthetized with an injectable ketamine-acepromazine cocktail and then administered a vehicle control, ribavirin (25 mg/kg), or ST-193 (25 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection beginning 1 h before LASV infection and continuing once daily for 14 days, as follows: one group (n\n = 7) received 6.4 ml/kg of the vehicle control (formulation buffer alone); one group (n\n = 8) received 25 mg/kg (6.4 ml/kg of a 3.9 mg/ml formulation) of ribavirin; one group (n\n = 8) received 25 mg/kg ST-193 (2 ml/kg of a 12.5 mg/ml formulation); and one group (n\n = 8) received 80 mg/kg ST-193 (6.4 ml/kg of a 12.5 mg/ml formulation). Viral infection was carried out under biosafety level 4 conditions. Each animal was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) a single dose of 1000 pfu of LASV (strain Josiah) in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl of physiological saline. Animals were observed twice daily and were assigned a morbidity score. Morbidity scores were assessed by assigning symptoms of illness a numeric value. Symptoms evaluated included: piloerection, visible weight loss, dehydration, orbital exudates, dyspnea, paralysis or hypothermia. The sum of the numbers associated with symptoms were added each day and the average of the morbidity score was tabulated daily for each treatment group. Blood samples were taken on days \u22127, 7, 14, 21 and 29 postinfection. Animals were euthanized when non-ambulatory and/or moribund, and surviving animals were euthanized and terminal blood samples collected on day 30 of the study (day 29 postinfection). Serum samples were analyzed for viremia, LASV-specific antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and blood chemistry values. Necropsies were performed on each animal, and tissues were analyzed for LASV-specific histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis.",

Unlike all the other animals in the study, this animal never became febrile. Daily body weight monitoring revealed progressive weight loss in all groups but the ST-193 25 mg/kg group (Fig. 2B). The ST-193 80 mg/kg group lost body weight initially, but weight loss stabilized by day 14 postinfection and guinea pigs began to gain weight starting at approximately day 21 postinfection. Vehicle and ribavirin-treated groups lost body weight at a steady rate until they were euthanized when moribund. Animals in all treatment groups experienced elevated body temperatures starting day 9 postinfection (Fig. 2C). However, fevers (body temperature > 39.5 \u00b0C) in both ST-193 treated groups resolved in the majority of animals by day 19 postinfection.

The most common histological observations included hepatic necrosis, interstitial pneumonia and lymphadenopathy (Fig. 6\n). Other less consistently noted lesions included endocarditis and pancarditis, renal tubular degeneration and peritonitis. Animals within the ST-193-treated groups had the least severe changes and those animals in the ribavirin group had the most severe lesions. The vehicle control group animals had the most acute course of disease (shortest time to death) with generally moderate to occasionally severe lesions. Immunohistochemical reactivity was found primarily with macrophages of the lung, liver and spleen in all groups (Fig. 7\n). Surviving animals were evaluated and generally found to be unremarkable. Evidence of interstitial pneumonia and mild hepatocellular degeneration or necrosis was noted in several animals; however, immunohistochemistry was negative for the presence of virus in all tissues examined in the surviving animals.",

This pilot study provides the proof of concept that ST-193, a small-molecule inhibitor of arenavirus entry, can protect animals from a lethal LASV infection. Although all infected animals became viremic, developed fevers, and exhibited clinical signs of disease (such as piloerection, reduced appetite and weight loss), treatment with ST-193 significantly limited the disease and prevented a fatal outcome in a majority of animals. Viremia in particular, as measured by serum titer, was dramatically suppressed by ST-193 treatment. In human patient populations, LASV viremia correlates directly with clinical outcome (Johnson et al., 1987, McCormick, 1986). Similar observations have been made in monkey (Baize et al., 2009, Jahrling et al., 1980) and guinea pig models (Jahrling et al., 1982).",

Here, weights declined steadily throughout the first two weeks of the study. Three of the four groups experienced average weight loss of more than 20%, while the 25 mg/kg ST-193 group did not exceed 10%. This suggests that weight loss might be exacerbated by the daily injection volume of test article, as the three high-loss groups all received 3.2 times as much volume as the 25 mg/kg ST-193 group.

The ribavirin dosing scheme was chosen for convenience as one within the tolerable range for guinea pigs (Kenyon et al., 1986), yet one with reported efficacy against arenavirus infection (Lucia et al., 1989). It may not necessarily be an optimal dosing regimen. However, this dose clearly demonstrated antiviral activity in this study as shown by reduced viremia and prolonged survival. Although extending ribavirin treatment beyond the 14 days used in this study might have improved survival, it is noteworthy that viremia was higher in ribavirin-treated animals than in ST-193 animals even during the dosing period. Cursory reports in the literature with respect to ribavirin efficacy against LASV in guinea pigs are mixed. While it has been described as protective (Jahrling and Peters, 1986, Peters et al., 1987, Stephen et al., 1980), it has also been reported that i.p.-administered ribavirin extends time-to-death in LASV-exposed guinea pigs with little or no effect on survival rates (Huggins, 1989), consistent with the observations reported here. Likewise, ribavirin administered s.c. at 45 mg/kg/day has been shown to prolong death in Jun\u00edn virus-exposed Hartley guinea pigs without enhancing survival (Kenyon et al., 1986). Ribavirin-treated animals in this study, though experiencing enhanced survival compared to the vehicle control group, exhibited a higher morbidity score (Fig. 2C) than the ST-193 treatment groups. In nonhuman primate models, however, ribavirin has shown clear efficacy against LASV (Jahrling et al., 1980, Jahrling et al., 1984).",

Though the ribavirin-treated animals experienced prolonged survival compared to the vehicle control group, none of these animals developed a neutralizing antibody titer at any time point, despite the fact that this group had the most robust anti-LASV IgG2 response, as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4). Interestingly, one animal in the 80 mg/kg ST-193 treatment group succumbed on day 21 postinfection, yet had only a minimum viral titer (1.2 \u00d7 102\n pfu/ml) in the terminal serum and immunohistochemistry failed to identify virus in the tissue samples examined. Histological analysis revealed interstitial pneumonia, lymph node hyperplasia and splenic depletion to a degree similar to that observed in surviving animals.

Previous reports have shown that neutralizing antibodies only appear later (>32 days postinfection) in surviving LASV-infected guinea pigs (Jahrling et al., 1982) and do not appear to play a significant recovery role in human cases (Johnson et al., 1987). Although the formal possibility exists that residual compound present in the serum mediated neutralization of LASV, this explanation seems unlikely as the day 21 and day 29 samples were drawn 8 and 16 days after the last compound dose was delivered. Thus these results suggest that a specific immune response against LASV was produced in the survivors. One possibility is that ST-193 treatment may mitigate LASV-associated lymphopenia (Jahrling et al., 1982) and thus allow for a more timely humoral immune response. The lack of strong production of LASV-specific IgG1 or IgG2 in treated animals as measured by ELISA may be due to several factors. Because these animals all became viremic to varying degrees during the study, it is possible that LASV-specific antibodies present in the serum were bound to free antigen, thus preventing binding to the immobilized antigen in the ELISA. Additionally, it is unknown what effect irradiation has on the antigenic epitopes of LASV, thus the low specific antibody titer observed may also be due to weakened LASV antigens.",

Differences between these two treatment groups were not remarkable, although neither was fully protective. Possibly the lower dose is sufficient to yield the maximum antiviral effect, or perhaps the group sizes are too small to detect differences in survival rates between the two doses. Another consideration is that within the context of this experiment, while the lower dose provided less ST-193 to the animals, the higher dose exposed animals to higher volumes of the vehicle. Weight loss associated with the vehicle volume may exacerbate the disease and offset the additional quantity of antiviral compound. Such an effect might contribute to the poor survival rate of the ribavirin-treated group as well, as that group received the same vehicle volume as the 80 mg/kg ST-193 group.",

Levels of AST and ALT were elevated in surviving animals, but had returned in the normal range by day 21 postinfection, only to become elevated again at the study endpoint. One out of five surviving animals in the ST-193 25 mg/kg treatment group and three out of five in the ST-193 80 mg/kg treatment group experienced this late increase in ALT levels. All of the surviving animals experienced a late increase in AST levels to varying degrees. This late increase in liver enzymes occurred despite survivors having no clinical signs of illness and little or no detectable viremia at the study endpoint. Repeat analyses were not possible due to limited sample volumes. Histologically, the surviving animals with elevated liver enzymes also had evidence of mild hepatocellular degeneration and/or necrosis at necropsy. Other laboratories have reported multifocal hepatic necrosis in the Hartley guinea pig that is unrelated to age or overall health (Maeda et al., 2000). Maeda et al. observed that in 202 guinea pigs between 4 and 23-weeks old, 111 of these animals displayed multiple necrotic lesions, most commonly coagulative necrosis, in the absence of any known disease (Maeda et al., 2000). Indeed, we have observed this phenomenon in our laboratory as well in uninfected strain 13 guinea pigs and at early stages of LASV infection before observable liver pathology with corresponding elevated enzyme levels. Another potential explanation for the elevated liver enzymes could be hemolysis of the samples, a well known cause of overestimated AST and ALT (Sonntag, 1986). In fact, another symptom of hemolysis, depressed alkaline phosphatase (Lippi et al., 2006, Sonntag, 1986) is seen in parallel with those samples with elevated AST and ALT. Alkaline phosphatase levels have been reported to actually increase in LASV-infected guinea pigs (Lukashevich et al., 2005), suggesting that the depressed levels seen here may be more consistent with hemolysis than with liver damage. Finally, a subsequent LASV infection study in strain 13 guinea pigs did not exhibit this phenomenon (R. Carrion, personal communication with. S.A.); in this follow-up study, ST-193-treated survivors displayed normal liver enzyme values. Ultimately, this finding may be incidental and unrelated to either LASV infection or treatment with ST-193. Additional studies should help resolve this.",

Future studies will examine different dosing regimens (e.g., amount, frequency, and duration), drug combinations, postinfection treatment and acquisition of protective immunity among treated survivors. Given the potency of ST-193 and its ability to inhibit other hemorrhagic arenaviruses in vitro (Larson et al., 2008), this in vivo validation bolsters its prospects as a candidate for further development.",
