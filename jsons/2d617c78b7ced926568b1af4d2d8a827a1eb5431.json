The molecular basis for IBV tissue tropism is not known. Nevertheless, based on the S1 sequence data, amino acid residues located between 99 and 127 sites may play a role in the different pathogenesis of these viruses (Kwon and Jackwood, 1995; Sapats et al., 1996) . It is known that 5\u00a2 hypervariable regions of the S1 protein (residues 56-69 and 117-131) contribute to serotyping or neutralizing activities (Koch et al., 1990) and this region shares a similarity between serotypes and genotypes of IBV (Kusters et al., 1989; Wang and Huang, 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 136, "text": "(Winterfield and Albassam, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 137, "end": 151, "text": "Chandra, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 638, "end": 650, "text": "(Zhou, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 871, "end": 896, "text": "(Kwon and Jackwood, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 897, "end": 917, "text": "Sapats et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1080, "text": "(Koch et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1178, "text": "(Kusters et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1200, "text": "Wang and Huang, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 335, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Comparison of the nephropathogenicity of four strains of infectious bronchitis virus", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Albassam", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Winterfield", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Thacker", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1986, "venue": "Avian Dis", "volume": "30", "issn": "", "pages": "468--476", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Procedures for the hemagglutination and the hemagglutination inhibition tests for avian infectious bronchitis virus", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Alexander", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Chettle", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1977, "venue": "Avian Pathol", "volume": "6", "issn": "", "pages": "9--17", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Early pathogenesis in chicks of infection with an enterotropic strain of infectious bronchitis virus", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Ambali", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Jones", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1990, "venue": "Avian Dis", "volume": "34", "issn": "", "pages": "809--817", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Completion of the sequence of the genome of the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["E G"], "last": "Boursnell", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["D K"], "last": "Brown", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Foulds", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1987, "venue": "J.
