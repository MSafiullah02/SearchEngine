Before drawing any conclusion regarding the relatively low prevalence of COPD compared to other comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, we definitely need more data, especially comparing this prevalence to what is observed in general population samples of the same geographical, age and gender structure, using similar diagnostic criteria. In currently available studies, COPD is identified through known diagnosis, which might lead to marked underestimation. Other speculative explanations for this low prevalence of COPD include a potentially stricter compliance to preventive measures including avoiding close J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contact, quarantine, and general measures like handwashing. A potential benefit from inhaled treatments including corticosteroids has also been proposed, but needs to be demonstrated [4] .",

Another meta-analysis also found an OR of 4.38 for the development of severe COVID-19 in patients with COPD [6] . In 339 consecutive over 60 years old patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, COPD was a predictor of death with an hazard ratio of 2.24 [7] . Interestingly, a meta-analysis focusing on comorbidities in 1,558 patients found that the highest OR for severe COVID-19 was for COPD (OR=5.97), compared to lower OR in more common comorbidities like hypertension (OR=2.29), diabetes (OR=2.47), cardiovascular disease (OR=2.93) and cerebrovascular disease (OR=3.89) [8] . In these studies, severe infection was defined by acute respiratory failure and/or requirement of ICU.

The following propositions for clinical practice are based on expert opinions from the COPD group of the French Language Respiratory Society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pneumologie de Langue Fran\u00e7aise, SPLF). When nebulization with short-acting bronchodilators is needed, a protective mask (Filtering Facepiece Particles, FFP2) has to be used by caregivers within 3 hours of nebulization to avoid viral contamination. Whenever possible, non-nebulized inhaled treatments should be preferred using, e.g., metered-dose inhalers + spacers or dry-powder inhalers, as appropriate based on availability and patients' experience, condition and inspiratory flow. When needed, oxygen therapy should be used as usual to maintain a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Sp02 of more than 88-90%. Arterial blood gas should be performed in all COPD patients with signs of respiratory failure. Hypercapnic acidosis (pH<7.35) should lead to consider ventilatory support including non-invasive ventilation (NIV), invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. If NIV is used, a mask with no leak and dual limb breathing circuits should be used to prevent viral contamination. In severe hypoxemia with no hypercapnia, invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy should be preferred. The effects of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 are still controversial [10] , but systemic corticosteroids can be used for COPD exacerbations in patients with COVID-19, if needed. As for other patients with COVID-19, prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin should be used to prevent thromboembolism in the absence of contraindication and the diagnosis of associated acute pulmonary embolism should be carefully considered in case of severe or aggravating conditions.",

Regular follow-up, support and management have to be maintained and probably reinforced in this context of COVID-19 pandemic, involving general practitioners, pulmonologists, physiotherapists, rehabilitation, smoking cessation interventions, psychologists, dietitians etc, as appropriate.
