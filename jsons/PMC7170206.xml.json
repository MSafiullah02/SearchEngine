The 2001\u20132015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set a target (7C) of reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.The MDG progress monitoring report by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation 2012 states that the drinking water target for sustainable access to safe drinking water between 1990 and 2015 was met in 2010, 5 years ahead of schedule.The 2012 report indicates that that more than 2 billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources since 1990, but there are challenges of great disparities, with 780 million people remaining without access to improved drinking water sources and 2.5 billion lacking improved sanitation. Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in this measure for rural dwellers and the urban poor in particular, with the burden of poor water supply mostly falling on girls and women.Nevertheless, the global achievement indicates commitment of government leaders, public and private sector entities, communities and individuals. The international community (UN Rapporteur on Human Rights to Water and Sanitation) will maintain its surveillance on water and sanitation even following the 2015 MDG target date.Source: World Health Organization/United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.

Globalization, industrialization, and fossil fuel dependency have become an accelerated threat to the global environment.

Urbanization, demographic, and epidemiological shifts are associated with growing populations with health needs related to long-term diseases and conditions. These can be aggravated by environmental pollution, which presents a severe challenge in rapidly developing societies with urban crowding, air and other pollution, and fossil fuel issues. Increasing consumption associated with increasing per capita incomes creates demands for increased food supply that will be difficult to meet. Agricultural reform with improved water management and smallholder methods including better transportation, marketing, and wider use of genetically modified foods will be essential to meet these demands. Such demands are occurring in an environment of decreasing water supply, uncertainty as to climate effects, and the continuing struggle to lift people from poverty and its adverse health effects. Some successes are impressive, with many mid-level income countries achieving better education and health, whereas in some newly wealthy countries the rapid increases in productivity and income coexist with large sectors of the population remaining in rural poverty and decay.",

Moreover, within the same community there will be wide variation in actual exposure levels to the toxic agent. The agent may affect different populations or subgroups differently. There may be genetic and social factors at play as well. In cases where there is a long time lapse between exposure and resultant disease, and many independent variables, it may be very difficult to attribute the disease to a specific exposure, as in the case of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. The risk of asbestos exposure was compounded by cigarette smoking, affecting the workers directly exposed. But asbestos also affected the families of workers, as well as people in the community secondarily exposed to inhalation of the carcinogenic fibers, with residual asbestos material having been discarded or still present in roofing and many other applications. The cumulative evidence established the causal relationship and justified action to eliminate asbestos use in work settings and the wider environment.\n",

These warmer temperatures surpassed the previous record decade, 1991\u20132000.In 2008, the latest year for which data are available at the time of writing, global carbon dioxide emissions continued to rise, reaching 30.1 billion tonnes, an increase of 1.7 percent from the previous year. This change was smaller than in the period 2006\u20132007 (2.9 percent) owing to the economic crisis.The December 2010 UN Climate Change Conference in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, was a step forward in international negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. A set of decisions known as the \"Cancun Agreements\" was adopted by the international community to address collectively and comprehensively the long-term challenges of climate change with a global drive of national actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.The Montreal Protocol for international reduction in ozone-depleting substances is a success story in protection of the ozone layer.

Box 9.7\ndiscusses e-waste, a phenomenon in which unwanted, old electronic equipment ends up and accumulates in various African countries. This situation is potentially solvable by heightened national awareness and stronger international conventions, with publicity and fines imposed by international courts against offending firms or nations. In a global economy, all of these factors link up with effects on the physical environment as well as on working conditions and many social and political factors, such as the widening gap between rich and poor.BOX 9.7E-WasteAfrica is beginning to benefit from electronic modernization, such as cellular phones where no telephone landlines exist, and further electronic gains as development advances. In another respect, however, it has fallen victim to the information and technology revolution. As a continent, it currently serves as a disposal ground for unwanted, discarded, and outdated electrical equipment, which typically possess toxic properties and release hazardous chemicals into the environment. This major global issue is referred to as e-waste, \u201ca generic term encompassing various forms of electrical and electronic equipment that are old, end-of-life electronic appliances and have ceased to be of any value to their owner\u201d.Examples of e-waste include televisions, cell phones, air conditioners, and refrigerators, which are transported from the developed world. The list of devices has greatly expanded through the years. The result is harmful pollutants into the atmosphere and underground water. E-waste disposal methods generally used (burning or landfill) contribute to the release of a mixture of toxic chemicals, harming the environment and humans, with leaching of poisons into groundwater aquifers following disposal.Electronic devices contain a myriad of toxic compounds, and of particular concern is lead, characteristically found in high concentrations in many electronic products. Moreover, certain components such as polybutleneterephthalates (PBTs) can accumulate to harmful amounts in living organisms. This may result even when limited quantities are dispersed, and consequently, PBTs place humans at risk for nerve damage, cancer, and reproductive complications.Massive amounts of e-waste pose major problems in developing countries, which typically lack any form of infrastructure, defined protocols, or legislation to safely dispose of the e-waste and to cope with the overflow. Countries in West Africa, particularly Ghana and Nigeria, are especially burdened by electronic equipment waste. E-waste products are quite diverse and vary in complexity owing to the rapid evolution of new product design.The lack of waste management protocols and enforcement in low-income countries allows this practice to continue. In contrast, regulations surrounding the disposal of unwanted devices are well established and growing in developed countries. The US Environmental Protection Agency informs consumers on ways to recycle or donate used electric devices, and many states have created specific laws pertaining to the disposal and recycling of electronic equipment.Sources: Orisakwe OE, Frazzoli C.

Waterborne diseases are among the most common causes of death in developing countries and remain an important public health issue even in high-income countries. They may be so common as to escape detection in point outbreak form. This seems to be the case in many countries, where hepatitis (especially hepatitis A and E) is endemic and where the incidence of gastroenteritis from Shigella, Escherichia coli, and rotavirus remains high. In industrialized countries, waterborne disease outbreaks have become uncommon events because of high levels of water management (Box 9.10\n).BOX 9.10Control of Waterborne Disease as a Crucial Element in Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Infectious Diseases, Twentieth Century, USA\n\"The 19th century shift in population from country to city that accompanied industrialization and immigration led to overcrowding in poor housing served by inadequate or nonexistent public water supplies and waste-disposal systems. These conditions resulted in repeated outbreaks of cholera, dysentery, TB, typhoid fever, influenza, yellow fever, and malaria.By 1900, however, the incidence of many of these diseases had begun to decline because of public health improvements, implementation of which continued into the twentieth century. Local, state, and federal efforts to improve sanitation and hygiene reinforced the concept of collective \u2018public health\u2019 action (e.g., to prevent infection by providing clean drinking water).By 1900, 40 of the 45 states had established health departments. The first county health departments were established in 1908. From the 1930s through the 1950s, state and local health departments made substantial progress in disease prevention activities, including sewage disposal, water treatment, food safety, organized solid waste disposal, and public education about hygienic practices (e.g., food handling and hand washing).Chlorination and other treatments of drinking water began in the early 1900s and became widespread public health practices, further decreasing the incidence of waterborne diseases.\" (CDC, 1999)\nSources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a 2012 WHO document discussing environmental health inequalities in Europe, rural populations in particular are identified as a vulnerable group. In examining the prevalence of inadequate water supply among several European countries, data demonstrate that rural populations are significantly more affected by this than urban populations. Those residing in rural areas are especially exposed to sources of inadequate drinking water, and this puts them at increased risk for waterborne diseases. Underlying reasons for this disparity include distance to water sources, minimal access to a water distribution network, and cost, as the price associated with water services is substantially higher in rural regions than in urban areas. The availability of safe, potable water for vulnerable populations would lead to marked improvements in the health status of many, as the risk of diarrheal diseases would drop and better hygiene would be maintained.

Globally, population coverage with safe water increased from 77 percent in 1990 to 87 percent in 2008. An estimated 1.1 billion people in urban areas and 723 million people in rural areas gained access to improved drinking water sources over the period 1990\u20132008. However, the most vulnerable populations still lack such access (UN, 2013; Millennium Development Goals Report 2013; UNICEF, 2012). Consequently, water scarcity is identified as a major global problem (Box 9.13\n).BOX 9.13Population Growth, Food Security, Water Scarcity, Science and TechnologyThe global population of some 7 billion people will increase by another 2 billion by 2050. The highest rates of population growth are occurring in water-scarce sub-Saharan Africa. Water security is essential for human life, socioeconomic development, and healthy ecosystems. Urban development requires increased utilization of groundwater and surface water sources for domestic, agricultural, and industrial needs. Population and economic growth requires more food production, which demands large amounts of water (e.g., 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of wheat consumes 1500 liters (US 396.3 gal) of water).Water use has grown at more than twice the rate of population increase in the past century. Although there is enough freshwater on the planet for 6 billion people, it is distributed unevenly and much is wasted, polluted, and unsustainably managed. Thus, pressure on water resources intensifies, with conflicts among users and damage to the environment. For example, Ethiopia is building a dam on the upper Nile, which Egypt views as a threat to its water supply.Water scarcity affects every continent. Around 1.2 billion people, or almost one-fifth of the world\u2019s population, live in areas of scarcity, with another 500 million people close to this situation. A further 1.6 billion people (one-quarter of the world\u2019s population) face water shortage due to lack of infrastructure to harvest, transport, and utilize water from surface and aquifer sources. Water scarcity limits agricultural production, leads to population relocation from regions impacted by droughts, and adversely affects food security in developing countries.Recent evidence indicates that the notoriously dry continent of Africa has vast reservoirs of deep aquifers with 100 times the amount of surface water. But the challenges of secure recovery systems require good stable governance, massive investment, and improved distribution and utilization systems. Developed countries such as the USA also face serious national and regional water shortages.Important innovations developed to meet the growing challenge of water scarcity include:\u2022safe water recovery from wells and surface water with protection from contamination\u2022safe water processing \u2013 filtration, chlorination, and new innovations in microfilters\u2022improved distribution systems\u2022monitoring and replacement of leaking distribution systems that waste large amounts of treated water\u2022improved irrigation techniques \u2013 drip irrigation, sprinklers, microsprinklers\u2022new plant varieties that can survive drought conditions\u2022home and industrial wastewater recovery and treatment \u2013 now over 75 percent utilized in Israel\u2022storage of runoff waters\u2022rainwater collection and storage\u2022desalination \u2013 now provides half of total water usage in some countries\u2022filtration and treatment technologies \u2013 self-cleaning filtration systems\u2022decontamination \u2013 from oil and chemical contamination\u2022community education to reduce overusage of scarce water \u2013 reduced garden irrigation, toilet flushing using \u201cgray water\u201d (e.g., from showers, kitchen sink).\nSafe water in adequate quantities for a growing world population with potential for serious climate change will make water conservation and innovative management a crucial public issue in the coming decades.Note: Maximum contamination levels (MCLs) are set by the EPA for the listed contaminants.Sources: Environmental Protection Agency.

All of these processes remove different pollutants present in the wastewater, especially tiny particles of suspended organic matter. They also remove synthetic chemicals, ammonia, nitrates, phosphates, and dissolved organic materials. Recycled wastewater is an important source of water in a world running short of water.

The Greek city-states had ordinances against dumping refuse in or near cities, providing waste disposal sites for this purpose. In medieval European cities, garbage as well as human and animal wastes were discarded into the streets and areas surrounding the home. In the thirteenth century, Parisians were forbidden to throw waste on the streets and had to dump it outside the walls of the city. In 1388, the English parliament prohibited waste disposal in public waterways. During the industrial revolution, medieval cities evolved into working-class slums.

These techniques are part of the engineering of community infrastructure. Seawater dumping is still practiced in some countries, but increasing global concern about the effects of such practices on the ecology of the lakes and oceans makes this solution unacceptable. Landfill is the most prevalent method of solid waste disposal. It involves spreading garbage in layers 8\u201310 feet (2\u20133 m) deep and covering them with a thin layer of soil. This method is adequate if well planned and supervised and has the benefit that methane gas produced by anaerobic decomposition can be recovered for use. The problems of seepage of toxic materials and potentially explosive gas accumulation require careful assessment of landfill sites and limit the potential of landfills to serve as a sustainable, feasible option. Limited possibilities for suitable landfill locations in large urban concentrations make this method of disposal a serious urban planning problem. Sanitary landfill is expensive because of the cost of collection and transportation, the land value, and the human resources required. Landfill under sanitary conditions requires compaction of waste and covering by well-spread yet compacted earth far from ground and surface water. The site must be fenced to prevent scavenging by people, animals, and off-hours dumpers. The landfill should be located away from residential areas, be well maintained and tidy, and have well-paved and well-drained access roads. It should be seeded, in completed areas, with grass and trees to control erosion, and must be maintained by well-trained sanitarians.",

Most commonly recognized as a component in food and beverage packaging such as plastic, BPA is problematic as it is classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. Results from the 2003\u20132004 and 2005\u20132006 NHANES, or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in the USA, indicate that elevated urinary BPA levels are correlated with heart disease.In addition to food packaging, further sources of BPA include drinking water, dental sealants, and household dust. Polycarbonate, commonly used to strengthen plastics and reusable bottles, also contains BPA. When heat is applied to the plastic (such as containers or water bottles), the BPA typically is released. A UK researcher on this topic estimates that globally, 5 billion people are ingesting BPA.A causal association exposure and health outcome of BPA and coronary artery disease cannot be established based on NHANES, which are cross-sectional in nature. A case\u2013control study in the UK investigated baseline urinary BPA levels of participants diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, and compared them with the BPA levels of participants who did not have the outcome (i.e., did not develop heart disease). This study indicated an 11 percent increase in the likelihood of acquiring heart disease with each standard-deviation elevation in levels of urinary BPA.The direct risk of BPA to humans is still unclear and controversial. However, increasing evidence suggests that environmental BPA exposure may be harmful to behavioral and other effects in children (Rochester 2013).Sources: Lang IA, Galloway TS, Scarlett A, Henley WE, Depledge M, Wallace RB, Melzer D.

The effects are increasingly important as the demand for and use of fossil fuels have grown for the internal combustion engine, heating, and power generation. Coal fuel used in homes created the terrible air pollution of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century London. In his classic novel The Jungle, Upton Sinclair described air pollution in Chicago in the early part of the twentieth century (Box 9.19\n). Such levels of pollution have subsided since the 1950s with the reduction of brown soft coal use in individual homes in most industrialized countries, but remain common in many mid-level developing countries. Use of coal-fueled energy plants in Central and Eastern Europe has created a gray zone of air pollution carried over long distances, destroying forests, creating serious damage to the human environment, and presenting health hazards to large population groups.

It is estimated that improvements in healthy air have prevented 160,000 premature deaths. The estimated benefits of reduced air pollution are as many as 230,000 fewer deaths, 200,000 fewer heart attacks, and 2.4 million fewer asthma attacks in the next decade (Welker-Hood et al., 2011). Collaboration among multiple countries and responses to air pollution on an international level are exemplified in the Montreal Protocol (Box 9.20\n) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (Box 9.21\n).BOX 9.20International Treaties to Protect the Ozone Layer in the AtmosphereThe high-altitude or stratospheric ozone layer of the air acts as a shield in the atmosphere that protects life on Earth by blocking the sun\u2019s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which affects humans and ecosystems. During the 1980s, scientists observed that the stratospheric ozone layer was getting thinner over Antarctica (the \"ozone hole\"). A series of conventions and amendments produced a high degree of international acceptance and implementation of measures to reduce the use of chemical agents that adversely affected the ozone layer.The Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer in 1985 was the precursor to the Montreal Protocol. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in 1987. This treaty is the basis on which Title VI of the US Clean Air Act was established. The Montreal Protocol was updated by a series of conferences: London Amendment (1990), Copenhagen Amendment (1992), Montreal Amendment (1997), Beijing Amendment (1999), and Vienna (2000).All UN recognized nations have ratified the treaty and continue to phase out the production of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer while searching for ozone-friendly alternatives. A broad coalition developed and implemented effective approaches to ensure stratospheric ozone layer protection. By agreements of an Executive Committee, the key agencies involved were the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the World Bank.Specific chemicals declared in the process include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), but not all are banned or being reduced. Atmospheric concentrations of many of the important CFCs and related chlorinated hydrocarbons have either leveled off or decreased. Banning many chemicals and finding better alternatives and technologies has contributed to the process. The US Environmental Protection Agency has approved over 300 safe alternative chemicals to those which contribute to ozone depletion. The ozone layer has not grown thinner since 1998, but continued enforcement of the phasing out of ozone-depleting substances is vital to return the ozone layer to normal levels over the coming decades.The Montreal Protocol process led to a broad coalition of governments, scientists, and others who work to develop effective approaches to protect human health and the global environment. Its adoption and implementation provide an approach to global cooperation in order to achieve global environmental protection. However, implementation by member nations is slow and variable.Sources: Sarma K, Bankobeza G. The Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer.

Negotiations to strengthen the global response to climate change led to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.The Kyoto Protocol legally binds developed countries to emission reduction targets. The Protocol\u2019s first commitment period started in 2008 and ran until 2012. In Durban, government Parties to the Kyoto Protocol made a decision to implement a second commitment period, from 2013 onwards, extending the first commitment by either 5 or 8 years.There are currently 195 parties participating in the Convention. The UNFCCC supports all bodies involved in the international climate change negotiations, particularly the Conference of the Parties (COP) and each of its supporting institutions.A complex global environmental issue, climate change carries with it consequences relating to all spheres of existence on this planet. It impacts and influences many underpinning continuous global challenges such as poverty, economic development, population growth, sustainable development, and resource management. Therefore, solutions to help mitigate these large-scale challenges require assistance from all disciplines and fields of research, and above all political commitment.The central issue in the response to climate change lies in the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2010, multiple governments reached an agreement that emissions must be reduced in order for global temperature increases to be limited to below 2\u00b0C.Rio+20, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in June 2012, planned to address climate change, oceanography, fisheries, resource management (water, land), food security, and further issues of this nature. However, the conference representatives came to an agreement to switch the key issue to economic development. Thus, a major emphasis was put on poverty eradication, an underlying and complex issue involving a myriad of global environmental challenges.Sources: Adapted from United Nations Meetings.

            "text": "Diesel air pollutants became the subject of scrutiny by the state Air Resources Board, which carried out a meta-analysis and defined diesel pollution as a health hazard. This decision requires use of best available control technology (BACT) to reduce emissions from the defined \u201cacceptable risk\u201d of 10 excess cases of cancer per million population. In the case of diesel emissions the excess rate was determined to be 100 times in excess of the acceptable rate. Industry opponents raise the specter of the tremendous economic effects of such decisions, but the BACT approach minimizes this potential harm to the economy. At the same time, the process of identifying the issue spurs industry to seek out technological solutions that are compatible with greater efficiency in the long run. Box 9.22\ndiscusses the development of US regulations designed to reduce fine particle emission air pollution.\nBOX 9.22Reduction in Fine Particle Emissions: Air Pollution Standards in the USASince the Clean Air Act was enacted more than in 1970, pollution in the USA has been reduced while the population and economy have grown. The health benefits far exceed the costs of reducing pollution. Less pollution lower the risks of premature death and other serious health effects. Environmental damage from air pollution is reduced. New cars, trucks and non-road engines use state-of-the-art emission control technologies. New plants and factories install modern pollution control technology. Power plants have cut emissions that cause acid rain and harm public health. Interstate air pollution has been reduced. Mobile and industrial pollution sources release much less toxic pollution to the air than in 1990. Actions to protect the ozone layer are saving millions of people from skin cancers and cataracts. National parks are clearer due to reductions in pollution-caused haze. EPA has taken initial steps to limit emissions that cause climate change and ocean acidification. The Act prompted deployment of clean technologies, with impetus for technology innovations that reduce emissions and control costs (EPA, 2012, 2013).These regulations require states to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that are partially responsible for ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. CSAPR identifies 28 states that are required to reduce annual SO2 emissions, annual nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and/or ozone-season NOx emissions. Together, these substantial reductions play a meaningful role in attaining the 1997 ozone and fine particle and 2006 fine particle NAAQS, thus replacing EPA\u2019s 2005 Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The new regulations will improve air quality throughout the eastern half of the USA, helping states to achieve national clean air standards.Similar to all health regulations, the purpose of CSAPR and its implementation is to improve a population\u2019s health outcomes. Expected health benefits directly resulting from CSAPR include reduced premature mortality by approximately 13,000\u201334,000 cases. Moreover, experts predict that the following number of cases will be averted due to CSAPR: 15,000 non-fatal heart attacks, 19,000 emergency room visits, 420,000 cases of upper and lower respiratory illnesses, and 400,000 cases of asthma attacks. The benefits include avoiding loss of 1.8 million days of work or school. This will result in achieving hundreds of billions of dollars in public health benefits, and will yield US$120\u2013280 billion in annual health and environmental benefits in 2014. Scientists predict that the new air pollution ruling will improve visibility in national and state parks, as well as tighten protection for sensitive ecosystems, including Adirondack lakes and Appalachian streams, coastal waters and estuaries, and forests.The US$800 million annual projected costs of this rule in 2014, as well as the approximately US$1.6 billion per year in capital investments already advancing due to CAIR, are making progress to improve air quality for over 240 million Americans. Moreover, the emission reductions anticipated to result from EPA\u2019s newly finalized Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) are not included in the estimated emission reductions from the CSPAR; once those standards are implemented, SO2 emissions from the power sector are likely to be reduced even further. More recently, since April 2012, the EPA has issued new standards under the Clean Air Act. These regulations pertain to hydraulic fracturing oil and gas systems, thus affecting the oil and gas industry. Anticipated outcomes of the standards include not only a reduction in groundwater pollution, but also a reduction in hazardous methane, benzene, and other volatile organic compound emissions by 95 percent.Sources: Environmental Protection Agency.

The effectiveness of MTBE in promoting clean burning of gasoline and reducing exhaust pollutants has also been questioned. MTBE has been found in 3.4 percent of water districts in California. Some 50 percent of drinking water wells in Santa Monica, California, were closed owing to MTBE contamination in 1995.",

Occupants of a building may suffer from allergies due to fungal spores, mites, animal dander, and feces of roaches or mites. These allergies are more likely to occur in buildings using humidifiers or vaporizers with stagnant water, which favor bacterial and fungal growth. Sick building syndrome is discussed in Box 9.23\n.BOX 9.23Sick Building SyndromeRecurrent respiratory infections, wheezing, fatigue, dizziness, headache, eye and nose irritation: when these symptoms affect people working inside a specific building, the term used to describe this condition is sick building syndrome.\nAlthough studied for decades, it is still a poorly understood condition, as scientists have been unable to pinpoint one single cause. The consensus is that it is a combination of various risk factors that lead to people experiencing symptoms of sick building syndrome. Potential factors include poor ventilation, low humidity, dramatic changes in temperature throughout the day, airborne pollutants (dust, fungal spores), and chemical pollutants, such as cleaning materials. Poor levels of cleanliness in the work environment may play a role in employees developing symptoms of sick building syndrome. Poor ventilation systems may fail to provide adequate fresh air relief from microbiological pollution, formaldehyde in furniture, ozone emissions from photocopying machines, and cigarette smoke.The common symptoms listed above typically improve or disappear after an affected person has left the building, that is, once the person is no longer surrounded by the exposure. While sick building syndrome is an increasing occupational problem, there are preventive and control measures that can and should be implemented. Some of the many strategies include elimination or adaptation of the pollutant sources, maintaining adequate waterproofing, removing water-stained ceiling and flooring, and keeping products such as paints, solvents, and adhesives tightly enclosed and in highly ventilated areas. Measuring air distribution and ventilation levels is also critical. Building codes should specify minimum levels of outside air admission; acceptable levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide; odor dilution; and adequacy of ventilation equipment. Further crucial factors include education and communication to advance the process of air quality programs, as well as prohibition of smoking in the workplace.Although the condition is not well understood and an affected individual can experience a wide variety of symptoms, a set of elements is associated with a higher prevalence of sick building syndrome. Host factors include being female and working in a job that is considered lower in building hierarchy (a more menial job), which increases risk of being affected by sick building syndrome. Exposure to paper dust, office dust, cigarette smoke, and increased use of computers are common factors. The likelihood of developing this syndrome increases with high indoor temperature (> 23\u00b0C in air-conditioned buildings), low fresh air ventilation, poor individual control of lighting and temperature, excessive use of air conditioning, water damage, inadequate building service maintenance, and insufficient levels of cleanliness.Depending on the severity of a worker\u2019s symptoms, employees suffering from sick building syndrome are likely to have economic consequences. Maintaining a healthy, safe, comfortable environment comes at a cost; however, so does low worker productivity and satisfaction. A study conducted in Switzerland showed that, compared with workers in air-conditioned offices, those who work in naturally ventilated buildings typically take less sickness absence. Moreover, a study carried out in the Netherlands examined the number of days of missed work due to sickness and whether a worker was given the opportunity to control his or her own office environment. The researchers found that among office workers who were given the freedom to control their own environment, 34 percent less sick days were taken.It is crucial that employers respond efficiently and effectively to their workers\u2019 complaints, as each individual deserves to work in a safe, healthy, clean environment. A substantial portion of many people\u2019s lives is spent in an office building; therefore, an individual\u2019s level of health is very much influenced by his or her working conditions.Sources: National Health Service.

The process of alpha emission can be hazardous to health. This is characterized by a change occurring in the nucleus and a particle being released, resulting in a decay product. The majority of alpha emission takes place naturally in the environment. When soil, minerals, or rock formations are disrupted (such as during mineral extraction), this creates a risk of environmental and human exposure. For instance, high levels of uranium and radium are found in uranium mining wastes. When they rise to the surface, they may contaminate surface water or become airborne. The severity of health effects is highly dependent on the route of exposure. Alpha particles do not have the energy to penetrate the outer skin layer, so exposure external to the body is significantly less harmful than internal exposure. However, if alpha emitters are inhaled or swallowed, or enter the bloodstream, this is a cause for concern. The radiation affects living tissue and may increase the risk of developing cancer, more specifically lung cancer if alpha emitters have been inhaled.",

Both human-made and naturally occurring beta emitters exist, with some present in our bodies. Health may be compromised when energetic particles are released. Sources of beta particle exposure vary, and may result from a nuclear reactor accident or as a consequence of a patient taking radioactive iodine. The patient will release beta particles and therefore must adhere to a rigid protocol to prevent exposure to family members. Similar to alpha particles, the route of exposure is important in determining the severity of the health outcome. Inhalation and ingestion are very serious, as particles in contact with living tissue can harm the molecules and disturb cell function. Beta particles are significantly smaller than alpha particles. As a result, they can travel deeper into tissues, causing more widespread cellular damage. In addition, if released from a strong enough source, when beta particles come into contact with skin, they can cause irritation, reddening, or burning. Although radiation from beta particles can result in both acute and chronic health problems, chronic effects are significantly more common. The major health outcome from this radiation is cancer, which typically develops from a relatively low degree of exposure over a long period. It follows a dose\u2013response relationship, in which a higher dose is associated with a higher risk of cancer.

Gamma rays and X-rays present similar health risks, their difference lying in the portion of the atom from which they originate. Radionuclides that emit gamma photons are the most commonly used sources of radiation. Some of their uses include treatment of cancer, pasteurization of foods, sterilization of medical tools, and measuring soil density in construction areas. Radioactive isotopes are used in diagnostic examinations, for instance, to obtain images of bone, liver, or brain. For the general population, the majority of gamma exposure comes from natural radionuclides, typically present in soil and water. Further sources include meats and foods that contain high levels of potassium, such as bananas. The majority of gamma and X-ray exposure is external, and the danger lies in the rays\u2019 ability to travel far through air and deep into human tissue, putting all organs as risk. For this reason, when X-rays are needed for dental or medical purposes, they are typically carried out in a controlled, well-planned environment. Although less common, radionuclides can release gamma rays that may be ingested with water or food, or inhaled, resulting in internal risks. Determined by the source, the radionuclide can follow different pathways, as it is either absorbed in body tissue or excreted through urine or feces.",

It can cause cataracts, impaired fertility, premature aging, and skin damage. Radiation-induced cancer can occur as little as 2\u20135 years after exposure, or following a latency period of up to 25 years after exposure. Greater risk occurs for those exposed in utero. X-ray-induced disease from excess exposure, faulty equipment, or human error is a hazard of medical care.

In Seveso, Italy, in 1976, an explosion in a chemical factory resulted in 17,000 people being evacuated and many terminations of pregnancy among exposed women. An elevated risk of hemopoietic cancers and some elevation of breast cancer risk was found after 20-year follow-up of the exposed population, although no consistent pattern with time since the accident was evident.BOX 9.25Nuclear Accidents: Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986), and Fukushima (2011)Three Mile Island (1979)In 1979, the nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania suffered a near disaster that devastated the plant but did not release nuclear material. It led to a review of safety procedures and heightened public concern as to the overall safety of nuclear energy facilities. There was no loss of life or radiation release, but the incident led to major changes in emergency response planning, operator training, radiation protection, and other safety measures of nuclear power plant operations. It also caused the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to tighten and heighten its regulatory oversight, resulting in changes in the nuclear power industry and its regulation, with much improved safety.Chernobyl, Ukraine (1986)In 1986, a nuclear energy plant located at Chernobyl in the Ukraine (then in the USSR) suffered a meltdown that breached the integrity of the containment vessel, resulting in a massive explosion of the reactor. Design problems and a series of staff errors led to loss of control of the reactor with power levels soaring to 120 times the normal, rupturing the fuel rods, and vaporizing the cooling system. A steam explosion then blasted open the 100 ton concrete slab covering the reactor, starting uncontrollable fires. Despite valiant attempts by emergency personnel and staff, the fires could not be controlled immediately. Air-dropping of sand, lead, clay, and limestone controlled the fire, but the heat of the reactor and radiation could not be reduced for many days. Immediate deaths numbered 33 individuals, mostly among the firefighters, with 237 suffering acute radiation poisoning. Around 135,000 people were evacuated from a 19 square mile (49 km2) area.The nuclear fallout material carried in a 600 m plume, including iodine-131, cesium-137, and xenon isotopes, spread across much of Europe. Fallout reached some 20 countries, and an international public health threat of major proportions occurred. Ten years after the incident, there was a highly significant increase in thyroid cancer cases in children in the three affected countries: Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The long-term effects in terms of increased cancer and birth defects are hard to assess, but current estimates are of 500 (1\u20132 percent) additional cancer cases among 100,000 people exposed to 10\u201320 rads. The actual increase in incidence of thyroid cancer, other cancers, and birth defects and the general impact on health will only be determined by careful epidemiological follow-up of the exposed population over many years. The economic impact of the disaster is estimated at over US$19 billion, and replacement of the plant reaches a similar sum. Close to the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, a second nuclear leak nearly occurred due to human error. The Ukrainian government reopened the second reactor in 1999. International assistance in technical and financial aspects of nuclear energy in the Ukraine is in process, but a large area around the plant remains uninhabitable.Fukushima, Japan (2011)On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake, with a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale, struck Japan\u2019s eastern coast, initiating a string of deadly events. Soon afterwards, the earthquake caused a major, 15 m tsunami tidal wave, which swept the coast of Japan and caused hurricane-scale damage, with many aftershocks. The loss of life was measured in the thousands, with extensive damage to homes, buildings, transportation, and many other community resources. By February 2012, there were 15,534 confirmed deaths and 7092 missing people among 12 prefectures, including Fukushima Prefecture.The force of the tsunami destroyed the power supply and cooling capabilities of three Fukushima Daiichi reactors, and a nuclear emergency became apparent. The main priority in alleviating the disaster was preventing the reactors from overheating. A second crucial objective was the prevention of radiation leakage, specifically in contaminated water released from the three reactors.The Fukushima nuclear accident did not cause any deaths or cases of radiation illness; however, this favorable outcome was only achieved through the rapid evacuation of over 400,000 people from within a specified evacuation zone. Despite no fatalities from the nuclear accident, a more tragic outcome shadowed both the earthquake and the tsunami. Owing to the amount of radioactive material released into the air, sea, and land, the Fukushima nuclear accident, caused by the earthquake and tsunami, is considered to be one of the most devastating nuclear accidents globally. Declared a public health emergency requiring worldwide support, the disaster was given the highest rating, level 7, on the International Nuclear Event Scale.One month after the earthquake, leakage of radioactive material from the power plant remained substantial, and the reactors\u2019 inadequate cooling capabilities still posed a serious threat. Cooling operations such as water injection and high-level water spraying were carried out by fire trucks and helicopters. Policies were established, issuing levels of radiation exposure in Japan\u2019s ports and in various areas. An area occupying a 20 km radius surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi power plant was pronounced a \u201cNo-Entry Zone\u201d, and the area is left uninhabited.Sources: World Nuclear Association.

While the transfer of hazardous occupations and industries to less developed areas is a growing issue, the tragedy at Bhopal led to greater recognition by policy makers and the public that toxic accidents can potentially happen at any time and in any place, not just in developed countries (Box 9.26\n).BOX 9.26The Bhopal Gas Disaster, 1984In Bhopal, India, a city of some 900,000 people, an accidental release of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas from the Union Carbide pesticide plant occurred on the night of 3 December 1984. The gas spread rapidly across the sleeping city. Some 3800 people died within minutes and many others were left with lifelong illnesses.Failure of inadequate safety systems allowed an estimated 27 tons of MIC gas to escape. A warning siren was turned on, but quickly turned off again so as to not cause panic; however, choking and coughing panic led to chaos and deaths by trampling.Estimates of the death toll vary; at least 3700 people died from immediate exposure to the gas, with other estimates of up to 8000. In the two decades following the disaster, an estimated 20,000 additional people died from effects of the gas. Estimates of long-term illness vary, with some 120,000 people living with the effects from the gas, including blindness, extreme shortness of breath, cancers, birth deformities, and early onset of menopause. Chemicals from the pesticide plant and from the leak have infiltrated the water system and the soil near the old factory and thus continue to cause poisoning in the people who live near it.Three days after the disaster, the chairman of Union Carbide, Warren Anderson, was arrested. Released on bail, he fled the country. He is still wanted in India for culpable homicide, but is apparently living in the USA.Extradition procedures have been obstructed by political issues. Union Carbide claims that the incident was due to sabotage, but acknowledged responsibility and paid a modest compensation sum of US$470 million to the families of those who died, although refusing to pay for the long-term effects. The case is still before the courts in India. Regulation of chemical industries remains weak. The Bhopal gas tragedy is remembered as \"one of the ugliest industrial disasters that have ever taken place\" (Broughton, 2005).Environmental cleanup has been hampered by a lack of governmental regulatory capacity. In June 2010, seven former employees of the Union Carbide subsidiary, all Indian nationals and many in their seventies, were convicted of causing death by negligence and each sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and fined. All were released on bail shortly after the verdict. Damages for personal injury, medical monitoring, and injunctive relief in the form of cleanup of the drinking water supplies for residential areas near the Bhopal plant are being sought in an appeal before the federal district court in New York. The legal and political implications of this disaster are still ongoing.Sources: Sharma DC. Bhopal\u2019s health disaster continues to unfold. Lancet 2002;360:859.Broughton E.

Nerve gases (e.g., sarin, tabun, soman) were developed by the Germans up to World War II. Poison gas was used with deadly efficiency by the Nazis in the Holocaust, but not in warfare because of fear of retaliation.",

The US Congress passed the Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 following the 1984 Bhopal disaster (Box 9.26). This legislation established state and local agencies for managing chemical emergencies. It requires facilities that handle hazardous chemicals to make information available to the public and preparedness for possible chemical accidents. This involves a holistic approach integrating technology, procedures, and management practices. The first responsibility lies with management, which must have a high level of awareness and commitment to accident prevention and safe practices. The range of industries at risk is very broad in modern societies; it includes local dry cleaners and furniture manufacturers as well as the chemical industry. The right to know extends from governments, professional societies, trade associations, labor unions, the research community, the news media, and environmentalists as well as the general public. The right to know has become the need to know. Box 9.27\ndiscusses the International Health Regulations and the importance of strong national frameworks capable of managing public health events and situations in which global health is threatened.BOX 9.27Progress of International Health Regulations National Core CapacitiesAdopted at the 58th World Health Assembly in 2005, the International Health Regulations (IHR) are an important tool in managing the growing globalized nature of disease transmission and health challenges. Implemented in most countries by June 2007, the IHR are a public health global framework, for consistency in national and international public health programs.The revised 2005 IHR, a legally binding agreement, includes chemical threats to public health, requiring countries to strengthen capacities on the effects of chemical events on human health. In 2012, a significant 5-year milestone was reached in global efforts to promote national capacities to investigate, evaluate, and take action towards public health events. This requires strategies to create, strengthen, and sustain routine and emergency public health capabilities at identifiable points of entry.Chemical safety, including prevention and preparedness globally, is promoted through the Strategic Approach for International Chemicals Management (SAICM). The comprehensive approach and global action plan sets out the scope, principles, objectives, financial aspects, implementation, and review arrangements.The World Health Organization Manual for Public Health Management of Chemical Incidents provides a comprehensive overview of the public health management of chemical incidents and emergencies, and outlines the steps to support implementation, with an emphasis on prevention. These include national legislation, policy, and financing; coordination and national focal point (NFP) communications; surveillance; response; preparedness; risk communication; and human resources and laboratory capacity.Public health has an essential role to play in preventing and minimizing adverse effects of chemical on humans and the environment. With the complexity of environmental challenges, fragmentation of roles and unclear responsibilities are common among the many functional centers, not only across but also within sectors.Sources: Hardiman MC.

Workers have lower death rates than the general population because they are demographically different from the general population and even epidemiologically different from a population matched for age and gender. This is due to the fact that there is a process of selection of workers that excludes the severely ill and disabled from employment. The selection process continues with attrition of unhealthy people from the workplace. This is termed the healthy worker effect and is a factor that needs to be considered in occupational health studies and practice. Death rates or other population-based norms from the general population may be inappropriate for comparison if this effect is not taken into account. Case matching or control studies may be needed to accommodate this phenomenon.

Spending extensive amounts of time in the workplace allows for the possibility of occupational injury; however, risks and type of injury are, as one would expect, influenced by work category or the task being carried out. New and interesting technological tools are being developed in an effort to prevent or limit an employee\u2019s physical distress (Box 9.33\n). Thus, the same tasks can be achieved with significant less risk of injury, which in turn reduces workers\u2019 compensation claims as well as lost workdays. In the USA, major progress has been made in workplace safety. While this is a great achievement, the importance of this public health measure crosses all borders, and there are advances to be made in occupational health globally. Progress in reduced mortality from occupational injuries is shown in Figure 9.6\n. The introduction of federal workplace safety initiatives was associated with a reduction of the deaths in miners; this is one of the greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century (Figure 9.7\n).BOX 9.33Occupational Safety in the USA: Achievements of Public Health in the Twentieth Century and Between 2000 and 2011The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated workplace safety as one of the ten great achievements of public health in the USA in the twentieth century. In the early years of that century, workers in the USA faced high health and safety risks at work. Large decreases in work-related deaths and injuries resulted from the combined efforts of government regulators, unions, employers, scientists, individual workers, and others. Despite reductions in injury, disease, and death from these improved work conditions, \u201cmuch work remains, with the goal for all workers being a productive and safe working life and a retirement free from long-term consequences of occupational disease and injury\u201d, especially in mining and forestry (CDC, 1999).Since 2000, progress has continued to improve working conditions, to reduce the risk of workplace-associated injuries. Patient lifting has been a substantial cause of lower back injuries among the 1.8 million US health workers in nursing care and residential facilities. Patient-handling programs introduced mechanical patient-lifting equipment, reducing by 66 percent rates of workers\u2019 compensation injury claims and lost workdays. Investment in lifting equipment can be recovered in less than 3 years. Following widespread dissemination and adoption of these practices by the nursing home industry, US Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed a 35 percent decline in lower back injuries in residential and nursing care employees between 2003 and 2009.The annual cost of farm-associated injuries among young people has been estimated at US$1 billion annually. A comprehensive childhood agricultural injury prevention initiative was established to address this problem. Among its interventions was the development by the National Children\u2019s Center for Rural Agricultural Health and Safety of guidelines for parents to match chores with their child\u2019s development and physical capabilities. Follow-up data have demonstrated a 56 percent decline in youth farm injury rates from 1998 to 2009 (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, unpublished data, 2011).In the mid-1990s, crab fishing in the Bering Sea was associated with a rate of 770 deaths per 100,000 full-time fishermen, mostly due to overloading of vessels which overturned because of their heavy loads. In 1999, the US Coast Guard implemented Dockside Stability and Safety Checks to correct stability hazards. Since then, one vessel has been lost and the fatality rate among crab fishermen has declined to 260 deaths per 100,000 full-time fishers (see Plimsoll line, Chapter 1).Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
