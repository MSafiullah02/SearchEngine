A mixture of rat sera from barrier facilities, which had tested SeV negative using commercial SeV detection ELISA kits (PL-001, Charles River, Wilmington, USA), was used as a SeV negative control. Twenty specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats were contained at an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited ABSL-2 facility and were intranasally infected with SeV (Garlinghouse et al., 1987). Three weeks after infection, 20 rats were euthanised with a sodium pentobarbital overdose after blood collection. The sera of rats were confirmed as being SeV positive by ELISA. A mixture of sera was used as positive controls.",

For comparisons of sensitivity between SeV linear peptides and complete virions, candidate antigenic peptides were synthesized and separately coated on 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Costar, Cambridge, USA). This process was performed as follows. SeV virion antigens or linear peptides were diluted to 10 \u03bcg/mL using coating buffer (28.6 mM of Na2CO3 and 71.4 mM of NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and distributed (100 \u03bcL/well) on ELISA plates. A mixture of peptides (10 \u03bcg/mL of each peptide) was coated on another plate. Plates were kept at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After washing three times with PBST, wells were blocked with blocking solution (PBST with 1% BSA) at room temperature for 30 min before sera samples (1:40 diluted with blocking solution, 100 \u03bcL/well) were added and left to incubate for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Sera samples were then aspirated off and wells washed three times with PBST. HRP conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rat IgG antibodies dissolved in blocking solution were added (100 \u03bcL/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C.

The enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 M of H2SO4 (50 \u03bcL/well), and blanked absorbance values at 450 nm were measured. The ELISA cut-off value was set as the absorbance of the negative control serum at 450 nm (N) plus 0.15 (N + 0.15) on SeV complete virion-coated plates.",

A SeV NP sequence comparative analysis was performed by DELTA-BLAST in a non-redundant protein sequences database (Boratyn et al., 2012). The homologous sequence of SeV NP is also found in NP from the following viruses: Human parainfluenza virus, Bovine parainfluenza virus, Simian Agent 10, Mossman virus, Cedar virus, Canine distemper virus, Nariva virus, Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus, Measles virus, Rinderpest virus and Tailam virus. The homologous sequence of SeV NP is located mainly at amino acids 1\u2013350. In the current study, all three linear antigenic peptides found were located in the carboxyl-terminus of SeV NP. The NP carboxyl-terminal sequence of SeV is comparably unique to SeV NP. SeV negative rat sera samples had lower avidity with the three peptides than SeV complete virions (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Additionally, a mixture of these three peptides had no cross-reaction with mouse hepatitis virus, rat corona virus or sialodacryoadenitis virus, the most prevalent pathogens affecting mice and rats (data not shown).
