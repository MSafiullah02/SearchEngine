Optimal therapy for CPPE and empyema hinges on adequate antibiotic coverage and pleural drainage [15]. If pleural loculations develop, multiple thoracostomy tubes may be needed along with intrapleural instillation of fibrinolytic agents [12]. A randomized controlled trial of intrapleural DNase with concomitant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in patients with empyema showed a lower rate of surgical referral and hospital length of stay compared with placebo and individual agents alone [16]. Lysis of adhesions or decortication via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or thoracotomy may be necessary if less invasive measures fail. The timing of surgical referral and type of surgical maneuver, though, largely depend on the patient and severity of illness.",

Over the last decade HCAP has been used to describe the entity wherein patients develop pneumonia outside the hospital yet have pathogens usually associated with HAP or VAP, such as MDR gram-negative bacilli and MRSA. Criteria for HCAP and the resultant number of patients who should get broad-spectrum empirical therapy remain subject to debate. Using any risk factor for drug-resistant pathogens (DRP) leads to antibiotic overtreatment, while ignoring risk factors is associated with undertreatment and adverse outcomes [5]. In a prospective observational study, Shindo et al. found six independent risk factors for pathogens resistant to the usual CAP antibiotics: (1) hospitalization \u2265 2 days during the previous 90 days, (2) antibiotic use during the previous 90 days, (3) non-ambulatory status, (4) tube feedings, (5) immunocompromised status, and (6) use of gastric acid suppression medications [17]. Presence of three or more risk factors should prompt a physician to consider broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, as the frequency of drug resistant pathogens may be as high as 43 %. These criteria work equally well as the previous definition of HCAP, and a strategy for initial antibiotic selection based on these risk factors may result in far less empirical broad-spectrum therapy while still identifying the majority who need it.",

            "text": "A community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) clone, distinct from that usually causing HCAP, HAP or VAP, has emerged as a cause of pneumonia with striking necrotizing features. Methicillin resistance results from a different staphylococcal cassette chromosome type (SCCmec type IV), which also includes a gene encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and other exotoxins. Presence of PVL may explain the associated neutropenia while other exotoxins, such as alpha-hemolysin, may result in the characteristic severe pulmonary hemorrhage of both the MRSA and MSSA infections [18]. Antibiotic therapy that also suppresses toxin production provides better outcomes and improved survival, as illustrated in a retrospective study of PVL-positive CAP [19]. Clindamycin and linezolid have been shown to suppress in-vitro formation of PVL, alpha-hemolysin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, whereas vancomycin and beta-lactams have no effect [18]. The benefit of clindamycin combined with a beta-lactam for MSSA CAP is unclear, with a recent prospective analysis demonstrating that nearly 18 % of CA-MRSA isolates were clindamycin resistant; whether antibiotic growth inhibition detected by MIC-susceptibility tests correlates with toxin-suppression activity, though, is unclear [20, 21]. While the preferred treatment for PVL-positive MSSA CAP is still unclear, linezolid appears the most reasonable choice for CA-MRSA CAP in light of its potential to suppress exotoxin and offer faster eradication of other MRSA clones. The rapid bactericidal activity of ceftaroline, a cephalosporin with MRSA activity, may obviate the need to suppress exotoxin production, but data are still very limited.",

PCT guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure, antibiotic prescriptions on admission, and antibiotic treatment duration without adversely affecting clinical outcomes [22]. Further analysis has shown that persistently elevated PCT levels are associated with adverse outcomes such as the development of pneumonia complications and death [23]. A similar benefit on shortening antibiotic duration with a PCT-driven protocol has been found in several studies of severe sepsis. Despite these studies, PCT has not been FDA approved for this indication in the US.",
