Chronic smoking is also well known as a predisposing factor to respiratory pathogens.",

Often, the pathogen recovered may not grow in the laboratory. In addition, molecular approaches cannot readily distinguish between viable and nonviable microbes, therefore compromising their value in risk assessment and epidemiologic studies.",

For example, phages can be enveloped or nonenveloped and can possess single- or double-stranded RNA or DNA genomes, which may be segmented, linear, or circular.

This reinforces the need for well-designed experimental settings and robust test protocols and the selection of suitable surrogates for airborne pathogens to evaluate potential means of indoor air decontamination as thoroughly as possible. It should also be noted here that experimental aerosolization of infectious agents may increase the risk of biohazards in general, therefore requiring the need for proper staff training, the availability of proper personal protective equipment, and the institution of rigorous safety procedures.",

However, modulation of RH and temperature in buildings or care facilities could be a promising approach to controlling the spread of some specific types of viruses in indoor air.

The efficiency of air decontamination varies with aerosol size because smaller aerosols are less likely to contact the decontamination surface.40 UV lamps have traditionally been applied to reduce aerosol transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the potential for UV to kill a variety of vegetative cells in air is not without merit. UV irradiation has shown efficacy against certain fungal spores, such as those of Aspergillus spp, and for removal or inactivation of microbial aerosols at significant rates; however, this technology was not at the time of the study applied on a routine basis during outbreaks.42 Use of a combination of systems and technologies is worth studying; as an example, a 1% concentration of hydrogen peroxide can increase UV's lethality 2,000-fold.43\n",

Usually, because these filters are not washable, an upstream prefilter is recommended for eliminating coarse particles and extending the life span of the filter. Antimicrobial and electrically charged fibrous filters are composed, respectively, of fibers that incorporate an antimicrobial solution (eg, virucide, bactericide, fungicide) and electrical charges that have been induced during the manufacturing process. As an example, the antimicrobial properties of fibers coated with tea tree and eucalyptus oils have been evaluated against influenza virus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Bacillus subtilis.53 The findings were that E coli and P fluorescens were inactivated on the surface of the coated filter within 8 and 2 minutes of exposure, respectively, whereas the more robust B subtilis was inactivated at a rate of 1 log10 per 30 minutes of process operation. Electrically charged filters are composed of relatively large fibers and characterized by bigger pore sizes than other types of fibrous filters in order to reduce cost and airflow resistance. The capture efficiency of airborne particles is related primarily to the electrostatic charges.",

Per the standard, filter testing is conducted in a test duct at airflow rates between and 1.4 m3/s, using particles ranging in size from 0.3 to 1, 1 to 3, and 3 to 10 \u00b5m. The overall efficacy is then expressed using the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) scale, which ranges from 1-16. As an example, using 0.3- to 1-\u00b5m particles, MERV 14 filters have 75%-85% capture efficiency, MERV 15 filters have 85%-95% capture efficiency, and MERV 16 filters have an efficiency >95%. The ASHRAE classification is appropriate for mechanical filters, but does not take into account the microbicidal properties of filters. There is no standard rating for microbicidal or virucidal air-cleaning devices, and studies using ASHRAE standard 52.2 to challenge filters against microbial aerosols are rare.54, 55\n",
