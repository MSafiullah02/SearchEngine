            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. Autoimmune and genetic factors are unlikely to wholly explain the aetiology of this disease, and an environmental component has long been postulated to be involved in MS pathogenesis [1], [2], [3]. Pathogens such as bacteria and viruses are the predominant candidates for the environmental factor in MS. Of these two biological candidate groups, viruses have been and remain the leading contenders and MS relapsing episodes are frequently preceded by common viral infections [4]. The infection theory of MS is strengthened by the observation that the CSF of MS patients contain temporally stable oligoclonal IgGs that could be the result of an antigen-driven chronic activation of possibly poly-specific B-cells [4], [5], [6], [7]. It is possible that this reaction is triggered by a combination of viruses, the order in which these infections takes place influencing the subsequent immunological reaction [8] With an ever increasing list of viral candidates, including the more recent additions of endogenous retroviruses, coronaviruses and several recently discovered herpesviruses [9], [10], [11], [12] there are many \u2018contenders\u2019 to chose from and little evidence to favour one above the other.",

Among these properties are the ability to initiate and maintain a latent infection in ganglionic neuronal cells with subsequent reactivation (prime examples being cold sores and shingles, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), respectively) and neurotropism [13], [14]. Herpesviruses which can cause demyelinating pathology and infection by other viruses are capable of triggering reactivation of latent herpesviruses [15]. Earlier investigations by others and ourselves have provided evidence to implicate a possible role of HHV-6 in MS pathogenesis [9], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. We have recently shown that Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) activity is increased in MS lesion tissue compared to both normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal control tissue [22]. As a logical development of this work we decided to investigate whether the closely related human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) were also detectable in MS brains.",

            "text": "Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) is a member of the \u03b2-herpesvirus family, closely related to HHV-6. HHV-7 was isolated in 1990 [23] and comprises a 145 kb genome encoding over 70 proteins, many of which share close homologies with HHV-6, Eppstein Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) proteins. Infection generally occurs early in childhood, with most individuals seropositive for HHV-7 antibodies by the age of 3 [24], [25], with 80% of adults testing positive for HHV-7 DNA in PBMCs [26]. Some report that HHV-7 may not undergo a latent stage, but remains persistent at low levels throughout the lifespan of an individual [27], [28], others that the virus produces no mRNA in the latent state [29]. Primary infection has been associated with some cases of exanthem subitum [30], [31] and encephalopathy [32], [33], although more have been attributed to HHV-6 infection. Another condition associated with both HHV-7 and HHV-6 is pityriasis rosea, an inflammatory skin condition which occurs in adults in their 20's and 30's, which is attributed to reactivation of the two herpesviruses [34]. Although HHV-7 reactivation has been seen frequently in patients with demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system [35], HHV-7 has also been found in the CNS at varying levels. A review by Dewhurst [36] concludes that HHV-7 is found in 5% of brain tissue samples. This result is consistent with that of Chan et al. [37], but whilst only 5% of the brain samples were positive, multiple samples were taken from patients so that total patient positivity was 37%. It has also been shown that HHV-7 can reactivate HHV-6 from latency in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [38], which may explain the co-occurrence of these two viruses in pityriasis rosea.",

Probably better known as Kaposi's sarcoma associated virus, HHV-8 comprises of a 170 kb genome bearing close resembance to EBV and herpesvirus saimiri, although it more closely resembles HSV in its regulation. Although largely known for its role in Kaposi's sarcoma and several other cancers, it has also been shown to be able to invade the CNS with increased incidence of HHV-8 DNA seen in brain samples with increased patient age [39], [40]. HHV-8 has been associated with encephalitis in some immunocompromised individuals, and there is a suggestion that it may play an indirect role in certain primary CNS lymphomas [30]. The incidences of HHV-8 infection and Karposi' sarcoma have risen and are a frequent complication in HIV/AIDS patients. The mode of transmission of HHV-8 is debated and although the main route is believed to be through sexual contact, the finding of HHV-8 DNA in brain tissue from stillborn babies indicates that transmission can occur from mother to child in the womb [40].",

Strong nuclear staining was seen in the KS positive control tissue (see Fig. 1D), although positive cells were visible in clusters with large areas of tissue seen without any positive signal (see Fig. 1F). No signal was seen in the mouse brain negative control tissue (see Fig. 1F). One of the normal control brain samples exhibited a small number of positive staining nuclei (see Table 1). Definite nuclear staining was seen in 5 MS tissue samples (see Fig. 1E), 2 from NAWM and 3 in lesional tissue encompassing a total of 3 individual patients (see Table 2).",

Within positive tissue, the infected cells appear to be randomly distributed in clusters with no more than one in 20 views exhibiting positively labelled cells (or an estimated upper level of oligodendrocytes infected with either virus of 5%). As the mRNA FISH signal needed 12 rounds of amplification, we conclude that levels of viral expression in infected cells must be low.",

The latter authors also found an uneven distribution of viral nucleic acid within the positive tissues, which is mirrored by, and consistent with, our protein and mRNA results. This uneven distribution of positive cells within the tissue may help account for the poor PCR and RT-PCR results, and suggests that multiple sampling must take place for a confident PCR result.",

Our results compare favourably to those reported by Chan et al. [39] on HHV-8 DNA prevalence in post mortem brain tissue. In their study, 10 samples from each of 30 individuals were examined and a total of 14% of these samples gave positive results for HHV-8 DNA. When this is tallied with the number of individuals that gave at least one positive sample, 63.3% of the individuals were positive for HHV-8 DNA in the brain.
