The ICD-coding system allows physicians and professional coders to express their diagnostic impression of a patient at different levels of diagnostic precision, ranging from very precise (e.g., ICD code 022.1 for inhalational anthrax) to syndrome (e.g., ICD code 079.99 for viral syndrome) to symptom (e.g., ICD code 780.6 for fever). The diagnosis may be a working diagnosis (a provisional diagnosis) or a definitive diagnosis, although ICD does not allow the clinician or coder to indicate this distinction. A clinician or professional coder may record an ICD code early in the process of medical care. Professional coders, not clinicians, invariably encode hospital discharge diagnoses, which are not available until after a patient is discharged from a hospital. The important points to remember about ICD coding are the heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, who does the encoding, and when the encoding is done.",

Rather than using NLP to assign a syndrome directly to a patient based on the chief complaint, they use NLP to find all of the symptoms embedded in the chief complaint. They define a syndrome as a Boolean or probabilistic combination of symptoms. The two-step process then is: (1) NLP extracts symptoms from the chief complaint, and (2) a non NLP process determines whether the symptoms satisfy a Boolean or probabilistic syndrome definition. As an example, consider the chief complaint \u201cn/v/d.\u201d With a two-step process, an NLP system would extract three symptoms from the chief complaint: nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Any syndrome definition that required nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea would be satisfied by this chief complaint.

In fact, case definitions (discussed in Chapter 3) are Boolean combinations of symptoms. Additionally, it is possible to create a new syndrome definition \u201con the fly\u201d without retraining a Bayesian classifier or restructuring lists of keywords. To do this, one simply defines a Boolean or probabilistic combination of symptoms. This advantage is important because new syndromes emerge with regularity, so it is important to be able to create a new syndrome definition quickly. Human biology changes very slowly, so new symptoms do not occur and the NLP conversion from free-text to symptom will be relatively stable, except as the language patients and triage nurses use to record chief complaints slowly evolves (e.g., the first time a patient uttered \u201cI think I have SARS\u201d).",

A real concern is that users of such systems can define syndromes for which the system's sensitivity and specificity may be extremely poor. A user may create a syndromic definition that is rational from an epidemiological standpoint but is not well-suited to the input data being classified. Without deep knowledge of the underlying processing method and its assumptions, a user will be completely unaware of this phenomenon and may be falsely reassured by the absence of disease activity when the newly created syndrome is put into operational use. As an extreme example of this problem, consider that a user might define a syndrome as a Boolean conjunction (AND statement) of five symptoms.

Briefly, when a patient registers for care at an ED, a triage nurse or registration clerk enters the chief complaint into a registration system. This step is part of normal workflow in many U.S. hospitals (Travers et al., 2003). The registration system almost always transmits chief-complaints in the form of HL7 messages (Tsui et al., 2003) to an HL7-message router located in the healthcare system. To transmit these data to a biosurveillance organization, the healthcare system would configure the HL7-message router to de-identify these messages and transmit them via the Internet to a biosurveillance organization as they are received from the registration system. This configuration process is a native capability of commercial HL7-message routers and it is a routine task for an HL7 engineer or other information technology staff working in or for a healthcare system.",

But it is worthwhile to review the steps in the process of assigning ICD codes and transmitting them to a biosurveillance system (Figure 23.1), and how these steps may contribute to time latency. First, an individual clinician or coder must acquire enough information about a patient to assign an ICD code. This individual may be a triage nurse who obtains the patient's chief complaint within minutes of the patient's arrival to the ED, or a professional coder who studies a four-inch thick medical record weeks after the patient left the hospital. Next, someone must enter an ICD code into a computer system.11\nFor physician-assigned ICD codes, that may occur within minutes after she sees the patient (which in turn may be minutes to hours after the patient arrived at the office or ED) or even hours or days after the patient leaves the office or ED. Finally, the computer system must transmit the codes to a biosurveillance system or other computers that in turn transmit them to a biosurveillance system. Systems may either transmit ICD codes in real time (the exception) or in batch mode (the rule). Ideally, studies of ICD codes would measure and report the contribution of each step to overall time latency.",

Espino found that ICD codes for diagnoses (assigned by ED physicians) arrived at the RODS system on average 7.5 hours after ICD codes for chief complaints (assigned by ED registration clerks). The maximum time delay was 80.6 hours. Because the ICD codes for chief complaints and diagnoses were transmitted in real time, this measurement of time latency includes only a negligible transmission delay.

Both ICD code sets had a sensitivity of 100% (1/1). The false alarm rate for the ILI code set was one per year and for the respiratory code set was one per three months. Detection of the influenza outbreak occurred one week earlier from both code sets relative to detection from P&I deaths at these false alarm rates and measurements of sensitivity.",

They are less accessible in the outpatient setting. Chief complaints must be subject to NLP to extract information for biosurveillance. The two basic approaches are keyword matching and Bayesian text processing. The NLP assigns a chief complaint either directly to a syndrome category, or extracts symptoms that are then further processed in a second step to determine whether the patient matches a Boolean case definition. Research on the accuracy of automatic syndrome assignment from chief complaints shows that automatic classification from chief complaint data into syndromes such as respiratory and gastrointestinal can be accomplished with moderately good sensitivity and specificity. This accuracy is not sufficient to support detection of small outbreaks. When researchers have attempted to automatically assign patients to more diagnostically precise syndromes such as febrile respiratory, sensitivity declines quickly\u2014chief complaints simply do not contain sufficient information to support such automatic assignments. Research has also demonstrated that detection algorithms can use daily counts of syndromes derived in this manner to detect large respiratory or diarrheal outbreaks such as those due to influenza and rotavirus.

Additionally, codes are collected at multiple points during the course of a patients illness and the accuracy and diagnostic precision of coding may vary across these points. ICD codes become available later in the course of the clinical care than chief complaints. From the perspective of biosurveillance, they contain indirect information about a patient's symptoms: the reasoning process that developers use when they include an ICD code in a \u201ccode set\u201d is \u201cwould a patient with disease X have respiratory symptoms? If so, let's include the code for disease X in a code set for respiratory.\u201d Research to date has demonstrated that ICD codes can be readily obtained from the healthcare system. The military fortuitously uses ICD to encode all services (and doctors do the encoding). There are several examples of ICD code sets developed for biosurveillance. A surprisingly small amount of work has been done on developing very specific ICD codes sets to automate the surveillance for conditions such as pneumonia. Research on the accuracy of automatic syndrome assignment shows results similar to chief complaints. As with chief complaints, this accuracy is not sufficient to support detection of small outbreaks. Research on the accuracy of automatic disease assignment using hospital discharge diagnoses shows higher accuracy.
