To reduce the spread of misinformation, we call for technology platforms to rethink the display of social engagement metrics.

To address this gap, we empirically investigated how misinformation spread is affected by exposure to typical social engagement metrics, i.e., the numbers of likes and shares shown for a news article. We found a strong relationship between displayed social engagement metrics with user actions related to information from low-credibility sources. The higher the level of displayed engagement, the higher the chances that users liked/shared low-credibility articles and the lower the chances that they flagged those articles for fact checking. Our main contribution is the evidence that exposure to engagement metrics in social media feeds increases vulnerability to misinformation.",

Engagement metrics are proxies for multiple exposures, therefore they are intended to provide signals about the importance, relevance, and reliability of information -all of which contribute to people's decisions to consume and share the information. In other words, being presented with high engagement metrics for an article mimics being exposed to the article multiple times: the brain is likely to assess that the article must be worthy of attention because many independent sources have validated the news article by liking or sharing it.",

We computed the misinformation liking/sharing rate by dividing the number of low-credibility articles shared or liked by the user at the given social engagement bin by the total number of low-credibility articles seen by the user with social engagement metrics within that bin. We used similar computations to calculate the misinformation fact checking rate for the user. Figure 2 plots the liking/sharing and fact checking rates for low-credibility articles.
