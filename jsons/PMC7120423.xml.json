Spallanzani\u2019 National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome), and other partner institutions in the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, and Germany, worked together to develop an assessment method for prioritising agents of highly infectious diseases, which resulted in a list of pathogens with the potential to cause cross-border outbreaks in Europe. What was needed was a set of objective criteria that would function as a tool consistent enough to ensure objectivity, but also flexible enough to be adapted to future, unforeseen scenarios. The potential to cause harm and to spread across borders was further broken down into several variables: severity of disease, risk of introduction into European countries, presence of reservoirs or vectors, size of the susceptible population, existence of prophylaxis or treatment options. A four-tiered scoring system was proposed whereby every single aspect was rated (from 0 to 3) to obtain a number resulting from the sum of all the individual scores. A survey was produced and disseminated to the BSL-4 laboratories that form the SC to collect their individual evaluations, which were summed up to obtain a final score and weighted average representing the consensus of the EMERGE SC (Table 1).\n",

The use of ProMed as an indicator of severity or threat posed by an outbreak has been a matter of discussion because of the difficulty in setting objective and consistent thresholds in a scoring system. The final decision was to provide the total number of events together with those published in the previous year, asking questionnaire respondents to provide a score from 0 to 3. The EMERGE survey was also used to collect information on the diagnostic methods available in every laboratory, as this information is necessary to complete the decision making algorithm: once the SC has identified a pathogen with a score indicating significant dangerousness and cross-border potential, the evaluation process will enter the next phases: (i) verifying that there are no other networks dealing with the agent in question, and (ii) identifying any gaps in laboratory diagnostics (Fig. 2). These two steps in particular are necessary to optimize resources and avoid duplication of activities: for example, Highly Pathogenic Influenza (HPI) and Ebola viruses were not included in the 2016 activity planning on the grounds that very large networks on Influenza are in existence [Surveillance and laboratory Networks on Influenza (website)], and that no considerable gaps in diagnostics exist for EVD owing to the extensive effort made to tackle the recent emergency.\n\n",

The approach used is based on an objective scoring system, a close collaboration with other networks dealing with highly infection diseases, and a diagnostic gaps analysis. The results were discussed at length by SC members, representatives of the EC and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in teleconferences and face-to-face meetings. The pathogens chosen for the first year of activities were CCHF, Lassa Haemorrhagic Fever virus, and Orthopoxviruses. As mentioned previously, Ebola was not considered an immediate urgency after the gaps analysis (many commercial kits are available or under development today), but will be re-evaluated annually during the course of the project. CCHF was the virus with the highest score (Table 1) and included as a priority for the 2016 activity planning (having excluded HPI for the reasons explained above); therefore the recent occurrence of an autochthonous infection in Europe is proof of the validity of our work (ProMed 2016). In a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach, Orthopoxviruses (Cowpox and Monkeypox) were also chosen (regardless of their relatively lower score) because of their presence in Europe and cross-border potential, and their relationship to the Smallpox virus, in order to improve the ability of European laboratories to deal with a possible bioterrorism event.",
