Today, nearly two billion passengers a year travel by air and the commercial airline network is routinely depicted as being the metaphorical glue that makes the world go round (Adey et al., 2007, Urry, 2007).",

Scholars including Bowen, 2002, O'Connor, 2003, and Witlox, Vereecken, and Derudder (2004) have shed light on the unfolding networks of air transportation and Adey, 2008, Gordon, 2008, and others have alerted us to the multiple historical and cultural geographies of the airport terminal. However, while much was made of aviation's importance to the administration and maintenance of 20th century imperial ambitions, including those of Britain (see Cobham, 1926a, Cobham, 1926b, Hoare, 1927, Salt, 1930, Sykes, 1920), the development of long-haul air routes and the formation of sanitary regulations for aviation is one dimension of the imperial experience that has received scant academic attention to date. This paper addresses this lacuna by tracing what we refer to as the historical \u2018bio-geopolitics\u2019 of passenger aviation.",

The significance of this calculation is, in part, reflected in research which reveals that, in an era of unprecedented global aeromobility when hundreds, if not thousands, of human pathogens are circulating the world's airways (Leibhold et al., 2006, Pavia, 2007), the global airline network plays an important role in the worldwide spread of infectious diseases (Avila et al., 2008, Budd, 2008, Cliff and Haggett, 1995, Colizza et al., 2006, Mangili and Gendreau, 2005, Tatem and Hay, 2007, Tatem et al., 2006). The epidemiological vulnerability of a closely inter-connected and highly aeromobile twenty-first century world was illustrated in 2003, when the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus rapidly spread from East Asia to over 25 countries around the world along the contours of the global airline network (Bowen and Laroe, 2006, Pang and Guindon, 2004), and again in 2009 with the outbreak of H1N1 influenza.",

Indeed, though the link between public health and international relations \u2013 and here we would include all aspects of border control \u2013 is not a new one, with many countries responding to the threats from cross-border diseases since at least the fourteenth century, it is only in the last decade or so that it has (re)emerged as a key geopolitical concern (Fidler, 2004a). For Fidler (2004a: 4), as for others (including Garrett, 1995; King, 2002), this is because national governments, especially those of advanced industrial economies, have come to recognise that one of the \u2018costs\u2019 of globalisation is the \u201cgrowing threat of the microbial world\u201d.",

One aspect that Ingram flags up for particular attention in his analysis is the suggestion that the forms of global health governance that have emerged to promote health security reflect a shift from Westphalian to post-Westphalian approaches. As Fidler, a key proponent of this argument, suggests, during the period between the emergence of international public health directives in the 1850s and the end of World War Two the question of disease control, in Europe at least, was regarded as the concern of individual sovereign nations who remained free of external intervention in their domestic affairs; that is, it was conducted on \u2018classic\u2019 Westphalian principles (see Fidler, 2004a, Fidler, 2004b, Fidler, 2004c, Fidler, 2007).",

Here, individual rights to health, as defined in the WHO constitution (WHO, 1946), and national interests were seen to be interdependent and international strategies designed to promote health and prevent disease within sovereign nations, such as the WHO's smallpox eradication campaign and its \u2018Health for All\u2019 strategy, were developed. More recent events, including the global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the 2003 SARS epidemic might, according to Fidler, be interpreted as further illustrations of a shift away from a Westphalian rationality, as the desire to contain both epidemics was/is framed by state and non-state interests alike (Fidler, 2004a, Fidler, 2004b). Although we concur largely with Ingram in his positive appraisal of Fidler's \u201cinnovative and sustained analysis\u201d of this shift, the question of whether or not the international response to the many and varied challenges to global health security are seen in Westphalian, post-Westphalian, or indeed other, perhaps imperial, terms, remains.",

Emphasis in original). In highlighting the centrality of borders to disease management, and to global health governance more broadly, Bashford alludes to the notion that public health intervention occurred outside of the jurisdiction of a sovereign state in the period that Fidler categorises in Westphalian terms. There are many examples of this, and Bashford refers us to, amongst others, European intervention in the former Ottoman Empire and to US public health campaigns in Cuba, Panama, and Puerto Rico. One reason for our raising this here is that Bashford highlights further the limitations of analyses of global health governance that are limited to a Westphalian/post-Westphalian framework. Further, she points researchers in the direction of what we might refer to as a \u2018bio-geopolitics\u2019 of global health governance; a term which reflects the interweaving of bio-political forms of power and geopolitics.",

We do so because, from its inception, aviation presented a new and challenging set of public health concerns. As we go on to demonstrate, Western nations, in particular, responded with a series of sanitary directives that variously framed certain destinations as being host to an array of \u2018exotic\u2019 or \u2018tropical\u2019 diseases that represented a threat to health and economic development. These directives prescribed a range of interventions, including quarantine and vaccination certificates, which aimed to secure western nations and their citizens from certain microbial threats. At times, however, this desire to provide ontological and material security created geopolitical tensions between those who thought that all possible measures should be taken to safeguard \u2018global\u2019, though perhaps we should read \u2018national\u2019, public health and those who resented the idea that aviation's continued development should be hindered by expensive and time-consuming health checks. As the concern surrounding the H5N1 strain of avian influenza (Health Protection Agency (HPA), 2007, Nerlich and Halliday, 2007) and, more recently, the H1N1 strain, have demonstrated, the trade-offs between screening air passengers at airports and the socio-economic costs associated with implementing such practices remain largely unresolved.",

We then explore the gradual, and often contested, development of international sanitary conventions for aviation that emerged in response to this anxiety and offer a bio-geopolitical interpretation of their significance, noting that the international regulatory frameworks that emerged not only sought to manage competing geopolitical interests but also to manage the threat of infection from a range of so-called \u2018exotic\u2019 diseases. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ways in which our analysis informs, and is informed by, recent debate on the broader geopolitical rationality described by Fidler as a shift towards a post-Westphalian global health regime and by others as a, perhaps, more nuanced situation in which western nations sought to secure the health of their populations through a complex array of bio-geopolitical strategies.",

For Australia, the United States, and many of the countries of Western Europe, the time-space compression associated with air travel rendered existing epidemiological surveillance networks almost redundant (Weir & Mykhalovskiy, 2006). The accelerated compression of time and space that aircraft effected meant that, \u201cA man [sic] might fly thousands of miles while incubating a disease, pass medical officials at the destination airport, emerge into a new land, and, a day or two later, go down with an infectious disease that he had picked up on the other side of the world\u201d (Stuart & Biard, 1954: 108\u2013109).

In response, local health authorities along the route to Durban attempted to restrict the movement of insects by hanging curtains impregnated with paradichlorbenzine, a pungent agent usually used to deter moths, over the doorway of aircraft, placing powerful air blowers by aircraft doors to try and prevent insects from flying in, and physically inspecting aircraft, passengers, and cargo for signs of infestation (Whittingham, 1938: 463).

Nevertheless, despite Salt's apparent lack of concern, the first tentative steps towards the internationalisation of sanitary measures for aviation were taken at the thirteenth International Sanitary Conference in Paris in 1926 (Massey, 1933). Here, it was formally agreed that a period of five days should be universally accepted as the infective period of yellow fever and a compulsory period of observation of six days before embarkation and a further period six days observation upon arrival was imposed in the subsequent Sanitary Convention on all passengers flying from an infected area (American Journal of Public Health, 1930: 1221).",

Though a system of maritime quarantine had been practised since the fourteenth century and was widely regarded as an essential tool in safeguarding public health (see Fidler, 2001), it was apparent by the mid-nineteenth century that a more extensive \u2018international\u2019 public health framework was required (Harrison, 2006). Within Europe, the desire to internationalise the public health effort was in part linked to the growing realisation that developments in transport and communication systems and the steady growth of transnational flows, especially between European nations and their colonial territories, left the continent vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases. As many commentators have observed, this vulnerability was especially associated with Europe's eastern borders and the apparent ease with which diseases including cholera and plague were able to cross into the West (see Harrison, 2006, Huber, 2006, Zylberman, 2006).",

More significantly, in the context of this paper, delegates were required to find a solution to a complex geopolitical problem: namely, how to accommodate the liberalisation of international trade and commerce whilst simultaneously containing threats associated with increased transnational flows of goods and people. As Huber (2006) notes in her detailed analysis of these conferences, for many delegates the solution lay beyond traditional public health practices, such as the imposition of relatively inflexible quarantine or cordons sanitaires, as these were considered an \u201cintolerable hindrance to international communications and commerce\u201d (Howard-Jones, 1950: 1034).",

That is, the aim of the various conferences was not to improve the health of those living in countries where diseases such as cholera, plague and yellow fever were endemic. Rather, what was put in place was a series of public health initiatives that sought to distinguish between different types of cross-border enterprise and were sensitive to developments in international communication and transport networks. With regards the former, there was a clear targeting of those \u2018enterprises\u2019 that emanated from the \u2018East\u2019. Zylberman's analysis of the International Sanitary Conferences and the response of the European delegations to the threat of cholera, particularly after the 1865 epidemic and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, are particularly germane here (see also Huber, 2006). As she reveals, political and health-related anxiety, especially surrounding the annual Hajj to Mecca, resulted in a 10-day quarantine period being established for the three main pestilential diseases after the 1866 Sanitary Conference in Constantinople. While certain vessels were exempt from such measures, the reality for pilgrims travelling to Mecca along the main sea-routes was that they experienced much longer stays in what Zylberman (2006: 25) describes as a \u201cmilitarized zone\u201d.",

By the time of the 1892 International Sanitary Conference in Venice, delegates were able to agree upon, and subsequently implement, a surveillance system that used telegram communications with ships travelling through the Suez Canal to determine their relative risk. Those ships that carried doctors and appropriate disinfection equipment were allowed to pass unimpeded, those that did not (or contained pilgrims heading for Mecca) were subject to inspection and observation (Huber, 2006). Another, perhaps even more pertinent example came about as a result of the Dresden Sanitary Conference of 1893. Here, delegates recognized that an expanded rail network posed new problems and were forced to consider whether public health inspections, and any resulting isolation measures, should occur at the point of departure or arrival. As Huber (2006: 468) notes, the debate \u201cbore significant parallels to that on passage through the Suez Canal: both were addressing the fact that technology had changed the way in which space was traversed\u201d.",

Six resolutions detailing the extension of sanitary aviation and obligations concerning government assistance were passed (Flight, 1930). Four years later, in April 1933, the First International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation was convened in The Hague where the Paris Office and the International Commission for Air Navigation prepared an agreement that provided for the first international sanitary control of aerial navigation (Massey, 1933). The resulting Convention, which became effective in August 1935, contained 67 Articles and dealt with threats posed by Typhus, Smallpox, Plague, Cholera, and Yellow Fever. Medical inspection and control of tropical disease were discussed, and detailed methods of eradicating the vector of Yellow Fever, the A\u00ebdes aegypti mosquito, were proposed (Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, 1933). The Convention also established common international sanitary standards for aircraft and landing grounds and provided, amongst other things, for the construction of anti-amaryl aerodromes, the control and/or isolation of air passengers in endemic yellow fever areas, preventative inoculation, and the destruction of insects in aircraft and around aerodromes (Whittingham, 1938).",

One of the most contentious issues concerned the treatment of aircraft arriving from endemic disease areas, and opinion polarised between those who favoured stringent regulation and those who did not wish to disrupt air traffic by enforcing time-consuming and expensive disease-control measures (Bell, 1997). This resulted in different interpretations and inconsistent enforcement of the regulations. Some countries demanded that additional disease-control measures, above and beyond those stipulated by the international community, be practised at their frontiers. For example, in the late 1930s, India and the Dutch East Indies prohibited any aircraft from landing that was flying \u201cfrom areas which can be considered endemic\u201d (Bell, 1997: 169), while the Nigerian health authorities demanded all air passengers provide a week's notice of their proposed departure date and travel itinerary so a decision could be taken on whether to quarantine them prior to departure (Whittingham, 1938). Elsewhere, the Egyptian and Sudanese health authorities required services between Europe and Africa to change aircraft in Alexandria and Khartoum, respectively, to lessen the risk of disease vectors being directly transported into their territory (Flight, 1935), while other nations obliged passengers to possess health certificates confirming inoculation against various diseases (Imperial Airways, 1939).",

The legal basis for eradicating insects and other stowaways in aircraft, or \u2018disinsection\u2019 as it was termed, through the application of pesticides and insecticides, was enshrined in Article 5(e) of the 1933 Sanitary Convention. This Article stipulated that all sanitary aerodromes must have the \u201capparatus necessary for carrying out disinfection, disinsectisation [sic] and deratisation [sic]\u201d of aircraft in order to prevent the spread of disease. However, early experiments with Flit guns, \u2018Freon bombs\u2019, and hand-held aerosols had found them to be largely ineffective as the spray they produced was neither sufficiently fine nor suitably penetrating, while the larger electrical and petrol-driven pressure sprayers that were employed at aerodromes were too heavy and bulky to be used in-flight (Flight, 1947, Whittingham, 1938). Other proposals, including pumping insecticide through special ducts built into the aircraft fuselage were similarly rejected on grounds of weight and cost (Whittingham, 1938) and signatories to the 1933 Convention merely agreed that disinsection should involve the application of \u201csome form of aerial spray containing a rapidly acting insecticide\u201d during flight (Flight, 1947: 95).",

A revised document, which called for \u201cspecial measures to prevent the spread by air across frontiers of epidemic or other communicable diseases\u201d, was opened for signature at Washington in December 1944 and was ratified by 14 countries including the United States and the United Kingdom (United Nations \u2013 Treaty Series 106, 1948: 250). The modified Convention introduced new documentation, in the form of aircraft and passenger health declarations, international certificates of inoculation against Cholera, Yellow Fever, Typhus Fever and Smallpox, and certificates of immunity against Yellow Fever. Yet while it was believed that \u201cthe spread of disease can be held in check only by a scheme which is internationally sponsored and internationally controlled\u201d (Flight, 1947: 95), the regulations were not uniform in statute or enforcement and the inability to practice global surveillance undermined their effectiveness (Davey, 1948).",

Variations in the validity of immunization certificates, with regards to dates of commencement and cessation (and even the dosage, type, and manufacturer of the serum that could be used), were another source of confusion (Kyle, 1948). For the smallpox vaccine alone, validity varied from a minimum of 12 days to 1 year after vaccination in Thailand to 21 days/2 years in Egypt, even though the international standard was nominally set at 14 days/3 years (Kyle, 1948). One possible explanation for these variations was that the adoption of universal standards would require the partial abrogation of sovereignty on behalf of the individual countries concerned as \u201cthe sanitary staff engaged in this work would be responsible not to local directors of medical services, but to the World Health Organisation of the United Nations\u201d (Flight, 1947: 95).",

As Gear (1948: 1092) remarked, \u201cthere is considerable difference between recognizing vaccination\u2026 as a reliable procedure and acknowledging the obligatory certificate as beyond reproach\u201d. Ironically, the authority vested in the very documents that were designed to ensure unfettered access to international aeromobility was increasingly being challenged. Writing on the British experience, \u2018Flight\u2019 magazine remarked that at foreign airports \u201cthose who examine the certificates are not always provided with specimens of the various types, or with a list of the medical officers empowered to sign such certificates\u201d and thus \u201cit is not surprising to learn that they have, in the past, been forged, and that it is reported\u2026that on the Continent there is a black market with a recognized tariff for these certificates\u201d (Flight, 1947: 95). It was also alleged that some individuals made false health declarations to avoid being detained at the airport (Stanley-Turner, 1947). A further concern was the suggestion that travellers may be tempted to bribe health officials to bypass health checks. To counter this temptation, passengers were warned, as early as 1924, that they could face a \u00a3200 fine for deliberately withholding information from health officials (Imperial Airways Ltd., 1924). Nevertheless, evidence suggests that those with sufficient money and political influence could (and did) buy their way around the regulations (Cobham, 1978: 131).",

The resulting new regulations were based on a number of principles, including the request that individual member states develop their own internal protection against disease through improvements in sanitation, the control of insect vectors, and national immunization programmes. Significantly, it was also decreed that the public health measures that could be adopted at national frontiers should be the minimum compatible with the existing sanitary situation, as excessive measures would not only interfere with the flow of (air) traffic and have serious economic repercussions, but also, by their very excess, \u201clead to deliberate evasion of the sanitary control\u201d (Cheng, 1962: 155).",

Yet, as we imply in the opening to this paper, such a reading overlooks the limited power that institutions like the WHO had (and arguably continue to have) in affecting change within nation states and also the tensions that continued to arise between individual sovereign powers in matters of infectious disease management (Davies, 2008). An example of this can be found in the tension that arose, albeit before the new regulations were in place, between Britain and India when it was alleged that practices of infection control had taken on a political as well as a biological dimension. More specifically, in response to Britain's routine disinsection of aircraft arriving from India, the government of India decided in 1946 (one year prior to Indian Independence) that all aircraft arriving in the country from Britain must be similarly treated (Barrett, 1947). Encapsulated in this \u2018tit for tat\u2019 response is what we might regard as the \u2018bio-geopolitics\u2019 associated with the materialization of an international public health framework for aviation.

As we note in this paper, the realisation that national borders were no longer, if indeed they ever were, \u2018secure\u2019, was highly significant since borders act(ed) both to define the boundaries of a nation and demarcate its lines of quarantine, for it is often at the border where human and non-human bodies and other potentially dangerous \u2018vessels\u2019 are monitored, surveyed, and perhaps excluded. However, as Bashford (2004: 124) rightly observes, \u201cborders aim to regulate and control movement, flow and exchange, not stop it all together\u201d.

The 1933 Sanitary Convention on Aerial Navigation established the principles and standards on which (inter)national public health measures should be based and, as we reveal above, involved practices that were targeted at both human passengers and at the non-human cargoes that were transported by air. Importantly, the 1933 convention sought to overcome the problem of where such micro-practices of public health should occur. As with other modes of transport, most notably rail travel, the issue was whether public health surveillance should be implemented on departure or arrival; that is at or beyond the sovereign borders of a nation. As we note, one solution was to pass some of the responsibility for implementing public health measures on to the airlines and their passengers. After all, it was the commercial airlines that were required to carry out disinsection, and it was the passengers who were responsible for ensuring that they carried valid documentation detailing the inoculations they had received prior to travel. However, the effectiveness of this system was undermined both by individual passengers and national governments who, frustrated that a supposedly rapid mode of international transport was being hindered by public health bureaucracy, chose to ignore or deliberately circumvent the regulations.",

In response to such threats, delegates at the Fourth World Health Assembly of May 1951 unanimously adopted a new set of International Sanitary Regulations (Cheng, 1962). According to these regulations, passengers embarking on an international flight to certain destinations had to be in possession of valid immunization certificates as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (not just the receiving country concerned) and rules regarding the mobility of non-human cargoes were also strengthened (Flight, 1951, Whittingham, 1953).",

The IHR aimed to \u201censure the maximum security against the international spread of disease with a minimum interference with world traffic\u201d and, to this end, required countries to notify the WHO of any case of cholera, plague or yellow fever that occurred within their territory and adopt universal hygiene measures at ports, airports and other frontier posts (Gostin, 2004: 2624). While individual countries could request personal health and vaccination certificates from travellers in respect of these three diseases, the health measures the IHR permitted were the maximum measures a State may take for the protection of its territory (Gostin, 2004). However, the narrow scope of the IHR meant the regulations were not only irrelevant for confronting known international public health threats such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, but were also non-responsive to the emergence of new infectious diseases such as SARS (Ashraf, 1999). In recognition of the IHR's limitations, a revised draft, which provided for increased surveillance, flexibility, and the global coordination of disease responses, was approved and adopted by member states in May 2005.",

On one level, the idea of a shift is useful because we can find some clear evidence of a Westphalian system in practice during the early years of the commercial aviation industry. Indeed, up until the mid-twentieth century, the regulatory ideas concerning the socio-political geographies of aviation, health and governance were emerging within a context in which the European (and here we might add the American and Australian) body/nation was perceived to be threatened by contact with foreign \u2018Others\u2019 (see Anderson, 1996, Bashford, 2004, Farley, 1991, Lyons, 1992). Yet, the creation of the WHO in 1946, and the subsequent establishment of an expert committee on quarantine in 1948, saw an attempt to challenge this Westphalian mentality through the adoption of new international sanitary regulations that aimed to counter the need for restrictive (and time consuming) national border-controls.",

For although we can see the traces of what might be regarded as a post-Westphalian regulatory system emerging, there is also a clear suggestion that national interests remained at play; many of which were, and perhaps still are (see Aginam, 2003), framed by geopolitical tensions that existed between imperial and post-colonial nations. Thus, despite our analysis largely focusing on the period leading up to the construction of this new regulatory environment in the mid-twentieth century, we argue that it offers important insights into the contemporary situation. As Braun (2007) shows with reference to SARS and other viruses, contemporary global public health security, even in a post-Westphalian system, remains a highly geopolitical entity concerned with the containment of risk and the protection of international borders from diseases whose origins are believed to lie overseas.",

As regards our methodology, by tracing in detail the \u2018historical bio-geopolitics\u2019 of passenger aviation, including how, when, and why regulations came about, our approach has facilitated a nuanced interpretation of the relations between the rise and expansion of aeromobility as the normal mode of long-distance international travel during the twentieth century and the development of global public health governance. In so doing, we have moved beyond many existing accounts that merely acknowledge that heightened aeromobility was a driver of new international public health regimes.",

In contrast to many accounts of imperial science and colonial medical practice, however, we have also shown that this regulatory impulse was driven not only by European fears of insects and infectious diseases that were new to western science but, more particularly, by a concern that as a consequence of aeromobility, pathogens in other environments were no longer \u2018in their place\u2019. Furthermore, our analysis challenges an evolutionary perspective in relation to the expansion of aeromobility and regimes of control. It has illustrated that, during these same early decades of the last century, the impetus to regulate others was accompanied by a broader anxiety that the complexity of commercial air travel posed threats to an increasingly \u2018global\u2019 community, and that national sovereignty must be qualified in an effort to manage the movement of transnational pathogens.",

Here our paper engages with current research which explores notions of biopower and biosecurity. Our contribution to this particular discussion has been to identify the emergence of an international regulatory regime for the international commercial airline industry that not only sought to stop the global transfer of non-human disease vectors by the performance of disinsection and other similar methods of insect control but also to enhance the surveillance and regulation of diseased human agents. In this sense, what we highlight are the beginnings of the kind of bio-surveillance regime that Amoore (2006) refers to her recent discussion of the \u2018biometric border\u2019. For example, the introduction of vaccination certificates might usefully be interpreted as portable devices that enabled increasingly mobile bodies to be surveilled at either side of a border and which acted to govern (but not unduly hinder) the movements of people and (by association) the disease agents they might carry.",

A recurring theme is the geopolitical tensions that emerged between the imperative to safeguard national and global public health and commercial concerns that the continued development of aviation should not be hindered by supposedly expensive and time-consuming health checks. In effect, there were fundamental differences between the demands of an expanding airline industry, for which heightened aeromobility offered opportunities for greater speed and efficiency of movement, and a regulatory regime of surveillance and control that appeared to constrain these opportunities.",

Whilst certain elements of the global air transport system, such as airport lighting and signage, air traffic control, and safety standards, have been amenable to a degree of consistent setting, interpretation and reinforcing of regulations by supranational organisations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and others, the regulation of humans and their bodies is an altogether more complex, politically sensitive and oft-contested process.",
