Marano et al. found that \"Patients who really need surgery and are suspected or diagnosed COVID-19, should be admitted to the COVID-19 area hospital according to preadmission protocol [1] \" and \"Surgery should be performed in a dedicated operating room with negative pressure environment and all personnel should operate in a full personal protective equipment including N95 mask, face shield and splashresistant gown [1] . In fact, surgeon get a high occupational risk to get COVID-19. The asymptomatic patient might undergo surgery without previous diagnosis and the disease transmission to surgeon and other medical personnel is possible [2] . In our country in Indochina, the unnecessary is postponed and most surgical oncology procedures are not done during COVID-19 outbreak. In case that surgical procedure is indicated, the presurgery testing for COVID-19 should be considered [3] . Management of the patients might be in any setting if there are limited number of specific medical center. The important rule is the strict following to standard universal precaution guidelines for any patients regarding known COVID-19 status or respiratory symptom.",
