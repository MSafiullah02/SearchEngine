We in this work, study the progress of COVID-19 pandemic in India. We aim to create transmission network visualization (s) of COVID-19 in India and perform analysis upon them. Using the transmission networks obtained we attempt to find the possible Super Spreader Individual (s) and Super Spreader Events (SSE) responsible for the outbreak in their respective regions. We discuss the potentials of network analysis in mitigating the further spread of the disease. This is one of the initial studies of the outbreak in India and the first attempt to study the pandemic in the country from a transmission network perspective. * .",

COVID-19 is a viral disease in humans with the major symptomps of respiratory difficulties, dry-cough and high fever. Originating from China the virus has spread over 210 countries causing 2,000,065 positive cases of infection and 126,754 causalities worldwide as of 5:12 am GMT of 15th April, 2020 [1] . On 11th February 2020, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 [2] is the virus responsible for spread of the disease. Droplet transmission and direct contacts are the most common mode of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans [3] . Precautionary measures such as social-distancing, self isolation and lockdowns are being looked as the only effective strategy for mitigating the spread of the novel virus, as no effective vaccine is available against it yet. Such measures aims to reduce social encounters or contacts to a minimum level, hence decreasing the chances of virus contraction.",

Public gathering and movement has been restricted to a minimum. The disease has been reported to be in phase 2 (local transmission) yet with limited or localised community transmissions in some corners of the nation [5] . Local transmission of the disease occurs when a healthy person gets in contact with an infected ones or contaminated surfaces or surroundings. Efforts are being made to check the disease in phase 2 itself. Failing, to check the disease in phase 2 will lead to phase 3 of the disease spread also called the community transmission. Checking, spread in stage 3 is much challenging as the disease spreads in the population in ways that it becomes difficult to trace the point of contraction. In this phase people having no travel history to outbreak effected countries nor having any direct contact with an infected patient are often diagnosed with the disease. Community transmission of the disease may have deadly consequences for the nation with a population of 1.3 billion. As shown in Fig. 2 , the developed economies such as the United States, Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom are now severely affected by the coronavirus and have experienced higher death rates. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the number of COVID-19 cases in India is on a steady rise. However, it will not stand far behind to the above mentioned countries if prompt and proper case finding, contact tracing, analysis not carried out. Although there is still not much evidence of community transmission of coronavirus in India (according to the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR)), there is no guarantee that this will not happen. Community transmission, if it begins, can significantly affect the social, cultural, economic, and healthcare infrastructure of different states of the country.",

Among those, 1,306 people are foreigners who are Tablighi Jamaat workers and their families that traveled from 40 foreign countries. The rest others are from different states of India [11] . Tablighi Jamaat participants were aggressively pursued following positive test results from six participants who returned from the event to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The island administration reported to Delhi administration that several participants are the likely carriers of the COVID-19 disease that they may not be aware of. More detail of the incident is available here [12] . As of 6 April, there were 4,067 confirmed COVID-19 cases out of which 1,445 were linked to Tablighi Jamaat in 17 Indian states and union territories [12] . As of April 11, 2020, 712 cases out of 1,069 COVID-19 cases confirmed in Delhi are linked to this event, which accounts for two-thirds of the total confirmed cases in Delhi [13] . As of April 10, 2020, Assam has 29 COVID-19 positive cases, out of which 28 had a travel history to Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi, and one patient has linked to this even has died [14] . As of April 10, 2020, Uttar Pradesh has 433 COVID-19 positive cases. In a bulletin later, the state government updated that 245 out of 433 are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event.

These are the people who contracted the COVID-19 infection either from an affected country or during a visit to the religious gathering and after heading back to home, took part in a meeting, workshop, party at different locations and came in contact with others during their stay and travel instead of visiting to the hospital for check up and undergoing self-quarantine.",

From the curve of positive cases, it is visible that the number of cases is increasing day by day, which is alarming for a densely populated country in India. Fig. 6b illustrate the date wise test samples and new tests conducted, respectively. From these figures, it is evident that the country is continuously increasing the number of tests per day by upgrading its testing capabilities. This is a good sign and one of the best measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country. ",

The patient 689 in the network infected a total of 14 others. Fig. 15a depicts the transmission network of the disease in the state whereas Fig. 15b and Fig. 15c depicts the respective centrality networks. There were a total of 215 nodes with 43 connections in the centrality networks. 34.4% of the nodes in the network were having connections to some other nodes in the network. 65.6% of the nodes were isolated. Table 5 provides the details of the imported cases district wise for the state Karnataka. In this study, we investigated the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in India and the countermeasures taken to control the spread to date. Transmission networks were used to understand the disease spread in the country. A total of 6 Indian states/UTs were considered for the study. Two network centrality measures namely the degree centrality and the betweeness centrality were used to analyze the connections among the patients of COVID-19 in each state. We found Nizamuddin Markaz congregation to be a SSE, which significantly increased the number of cases in the country. Particularly, the state of Assam has all its cases directly or indirectly associated with the SSE. Also, we identified super spreader individuals throughout the states using the centrality measures. Such as Oman returnee of Siwan(Bihar) infecting 21 others, London returnee of Mysuru(Karnataka), the case of Pathanamthitta(Kerala) people returning from Italy. Family and friends component infections display higher inter-connectivity than other scenarios of disease transmission as seen in C6 of Fig. 13a . With the betweeness centrality, we find while a patient/individual is directly associated with others it is not always the pathway to further infections in the network. The node 172 in Fig. 14c exhibits much higher betweeness centrality in comparison to others in the network as it acts as the only pathway from node 225 to 226,224 and 335. Although, 172 itself was an infected node with imported infection and did infected others with its direct associations. However, the scenario would have been different if any other node say, 224 is infected thus in this setting the infection would have passed to others via 172. Therefore finding such middle nodes or the individuals will help to eliminate further infections. However, such an objective will require the contact information of each patient available. A network of contacts can be generated based upon the patient history and can be used in conjunction with the transmission network for mitigating large outbreaks in the region. A limitation in this study lies in the data accuracy and completeness of the information. The data source is based on data made available from both the official such as news bulletins released by the government (both central and states) as well as crowd-sourced from a group of volunteers. The crowd-sourced data comes from sources such as Twitter handles of health ministry(both central and states). Information released by these sources is much limited in detail. This is one of the reasons of a significant number of isolated nodes present in our networks. Besides, the limitation in the information the publically available data source used in the work is much acknowledged, the results are meaningful and allow to map the spread of the disease across the districts of the Indian states. Much detailed information about the patients is required to answer some of the crucial questions of the hour:",
