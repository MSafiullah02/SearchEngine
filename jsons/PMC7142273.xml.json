The enzyme was shown to degrade macromolecular 35S-labeled, mastocytoma heparin to products similar in size to commercial heparin apparently by nonrandom cleavage of a limited number of glycosidic linkages per molecule. Prolonged incubation times did not result in further degradation of the product. No significant depolymerizing activity was observed with any other glycosaminoglycan tested, including chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, and commercial heparin. The pH optimum for degradation of macromolecular heparin was around pH 5. Analysis of the degradation products showed a major radioactive component which behaved like L-gulonic acid. Since [3H]gulonic acid would be the expected reduction product of a polysaccharide molecule, containing a glucuronic acid residue in terminal position, these results tentatively suggest that the heparinase is an endoglucuronidase. It appears that cleavage occurs in regions more abundant in N-acetylated glucosamine residues than other portions of the molecule [6].\u2217First paper stating that an endoglucuronidase is responsible for cleavage of heparin by mastocytoma cells. Notably, the presence of such heparin degrading activity was reported by the same authors already in 1971 [42].",

The overall extent of purification of the platelet heparitinase is about 240,000-fold and the overall yield of the enzyme is about 5.6% as compared to the initial freeze-thaw solubilization preparation. The final product is physically homogeneous and exhibits an apparent molecular weight of approximately 134,000. Furthermore, our results indicate that the above enzyme is present within platelet lysosomes. The biologic potency of the endoglycosidase was examined as a function of pH and is maximally active from pH 5.5 to pH 7.5. The substrate specificity of the platelet endoglycosidase was determined by identifying susceptible linkages within the heparin molecule that can be cleaved by the above component. Our studies indicate that this enzyme is only able to hydrolyze glucuronsylglucosamine linkages. Furthermore, investigation of the structure of the disaccharide which lies on the nonreducing end of the cleaved glucuronic acid residue suggests that N-sulfation of the glucosamine moiety or ester sulfation of the adjacent iduronic acid groups are not essential for bond scission [9].\u2217Early (1982) study on the purification and properties of HS-degrading endoglycosidase in platelets.",

Intact B16 cells (or their cell-free homogenates) with a high potential for lung colonization degraded purified HS from bovine lung at higher rates than did B16 cells with poor potential for lung colonization. Analysis of the degradation fragments indicated that B16 cells have HS endoglycosidase. Thus the abilities of B16 melanoma cells to extravasate and successfully colonize the lung may be related to their capacities to degrade HS in the walls of pulmonary blood vessels [44].\u2217First study (1983) showing that HS endoglycosidase is associated with the metastatic potential of melanoma cells.",

The ECM was metabolically labeled with Na235SO4, and the tumor cell-mediated release of labeled degradation products was analyzed by gel filtration. More than 90% of the labeled material released upon incubation of ESb cells with the ECM, either when exposed or covered with vascular endothelial cells, was in the form of low-Mr, HS-containing fragments compared to high-Mr nearly intact sulfated proteoglycans released by incubation with the low-metastatic Eb cells. The same high- and low-Mr degradation products were obtained by incubation of the ECM with a serum-free medium conditioned by the low (Eb)- and high (ESb)-metastatic sublines, respectively. The high-Mr proteoglycans released by incubation of the ECM with Eb-conditioned medium was further degraded into low Mr. GAG fragments upon subsequent incubation with ESb-conditioned medium. These fragments were smaller than intact glycosaminoglycan side chains released by treatment of the ECM with papain or alkaline borohydride, suggesting an ESb-specific endoglycosidase activity. The higher ability of the ESb over the Eb cells to solubilize the GAG scaffolding of the sub-endothelial ECM may, among other properties, facilitate their hematogenous dissemination and extravasation [45].\u2217First study (1983) showing that HS endoglycosidase is associated with the metastatic potential of lymphoma cells.",

To investigate how effector T cells reach targets outside the walls of blood vessels, we have studied the interaction of anti-BP effector T lymphocytes with the basement membrane-like ECM produced by vascular endothelial cells. It was found that activated but not resting T lymphocytes produce an endoglycosidase (heparanase) capable of degrading HS side chains of the proteoglycan scaffold of the ECM. Moreover, the anti-BP T lymphocytes respond to BP presented by ECM by markedly enhanced elaboration of the endoglycosidase. These results suggest that tissue-specific antigens on blood vessel walls could direct lymphocyte homing by activating enzymes that facilitate penetration of the subendothelial basal lamina. They also suggest that effector T lymphocytes can recognize antigen which is not associated with a major histocompatibility complex signal [21].\u2217First study (1984) describing the expression and function of heparanase in activated T lymphocytes.",

Briefly, it was found that degradation of HS in the ECM was markedly enhanced in the presence of plasminogen and inhibited by aprotinin, suggesting a role for plasminogen activator (PA) in sequential degradation of the ECM-HS [47]. Moreover, subsequent studies revealed that PA activity is residing in the ECM itself [48]. Thus, incubation of plasminogen on ECM resulted in plasmin generation and heating the ECM inactivated its ability to generate plasmin upon incubation with plasminogen. It was concluded that a proteolytic activity expressed by the tumor cells and/or residing in the tumor microenvironment (i.e., ECM) participate synergistically in sequential degradation of the EM\u2019 HS. This sequential cleavage is characteristic of degradation of a multimolecular structure such as the subendothelial ECM and hence cannot be detected in studies with purified HS as a substrate .

We hypothesized that release of ECM-bound basic FGF could stimulate the autocrine proliferation of adjacent endothelial cells. Moreover, tumor angiogenesis may in part be mediated by the action of tumor-derived HS-degrading enzymes, which would release basic FGF stored in capillary basement membrane. We further proposed that release of intracellular and extracellular stores of basic FGF may be a mechanism for the rapid mobilization of angiogenesis factors.

Abnormal release of this growth factor could be responsible for corneal neovascularization in a variety of ocular diseases.

For this purpose, we prepared various species of low-sulfated or LMW heparins, all of which exhibited less than 7% of the anticoagulant activity of native heparin. N-sulfate groups of heparin are necessary for its heparanase inhibitory activity but can be substituted by an acetyl group provided that the O-sulfate groups are retained. O-sulfate groups could be removed provided that the N positions were resulfated. Total desulfation of heparin abolished its heparanase inhibitory activity. Heparan sulfate was a 25-fold less potent heparanase inhibitor than native heparin. Efficiency of LMW heparins to inhibit degradation of HS in ECM decreased with their main molecular size, and a synthetic pentasaccharide, representing the binding site to antithrombin III, was devoid of inhibitory activity. Similar results were obtained with heparanase activities released from platelets, neutrophils, and lymphoma cells.

Heparin and fucoidan both completely inhibited passive EAE even when treatment was begun 3 days after transfer of cells. Pentosan sulfate was partially inhibitory whereas chondroitin-4-sulfate had no effect. Inhibition was not merely due to killing of the cells since active sensitization 14 days after cell transfer resulted in an early onset of disease indicating the persistence of transferred cells as memory cells. Although all the inhibitory polysaccharides are anticoagulants, it would appear that this function alone is not the reason for inhibition since a heparin preparation devoid of anticoagulant activity also partially inhibited EAE. Actively induced EAE was also significantly delayed by treatment with heparin. The results are discussed in terms of the polysaccharides inhibiting the enzymatic dependent movement of lymphocytes across central nervous system vascular endothelium [53].",

Antisera produced in animals immunized with a C-terminal synthetic peptide of PBP inhibited heparanase activity by 95%, compared with activity of the purified enzyme in the presence of the preimmune sera.

The sizes of the short HS chains generated by the partially purified heparanases ranged from 6 to 9 kDa. Interestingly, all four enzymes generate short glycosaminoglycans with a sulfate-rich, modified domain at the non-reducing end of the newly formed chain.

[58] found that overexpression of the cDNA-encoding heparanase conferred a metastatic phenotype in lymphoma cells. Nevertheless, it was argued that the ability of increased heparanase levels to induce a metastatic phenotype does not necessarily imply that tumors make use of heparanase to drive tumor dissemination. In subsequent studies, Edovitsky et al. [57] have attempted to address this shortcoming by using ribozyme and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to knock down the levels of endogenous heparanase. The authors showed that, in models of experimental and spontaneous metastases, these strategies attenuated the ability of diverse tumor cells, including melanoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and glioma cells, to invade in vitro and to colonize distant sites including the liver and lungs. This study [57] and an earlier study [59] performed by Uno et al. provided strong support for a role of heparanase in the metastatic process. Nevertheless, caution was taken in predicting clinical efficacy given that tumor cells have a remarkable system of redundant mechanisms that can efficiently overcome the targeting of single molecules [60]. This redundancy is one of the contributing mechanisms underlying the lack of clinical benefit seen with metalloproteinase inhibitors in cancer patients [61]. Taking into account that only one HS-degrading endoglycosidase was identified, redundancy is not considered a problem in targeting heparanase as compared to metalloproteinases.",

Consequently, treatment of such patients with anti-heparanase regimens might be akin to closing the barn door after the horse has bolted [56]. Thus, how could a knock-out punch against heparanase be useful in the treatment of cancer patients? There are at least two options. First, with increasing public awareness, and as cancer screenings become more prevalent in the general population, the number of patients diagnosed with early-stage disease should increase. By definition, such tumors are still localized and are therefore more amenable to therapy with anti-metastasis agents. Second, considering the proangiogenic effects of heparanase first documented by Edovitsky et al. [62] and Elkin et al. [63], anti-heparanase drugs may have a static effect on both the primary tumor and distant tumor lesions by preventing the establishment of tumor vasculature necessary for tumor growth beyond 1 mm3. These considerations made a compelling case for the role of heparanase in tumor progression. The extent to which this information can be exploited in novel therapies depends on the development of specific inhibitors that target heparanase and the blockade of redundant mechanisms that compensate for the loss of heparanase in cancer. This statement was rightly written (2004) in an editorial to the gene silencing paper [56] and is relevant nowadays as well.",

EGR1 is a nuclear phospho-protein that is rapidly induced in response to a variety of extracellular and environmental signals (including growth factors, cytokines, vascular injury, and hypoxia) [66, 67]. Studies using knockdown strategies have confirmed that EGR1 binds the HPSE promoter in vivo and plays a central role in tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis in breast, bladder, colon and prostate adenocarcinomas [65, 68, 69], supporting a central role for EGR1 in regulating HPSE transcription in tumor cells (Gaskin et al., Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-34521-1_7 in this volume).",

            "text": "Elkin et al. identified putative estrogen response elements in the heparanase promoter and demonstrated their functionality applying a luciferase reporter gene driven by the heparanase promoter [70]. Physical association between estrogen receptor (ER) and the heparanase promoter was confirmed by ChIP analysis. ChIP analysis, also revealed that wild type p53 inhibits transcription of the heparanase gene by direct binding to its promoter, while mutated, tumor-derived variants of p53 lose this inhibitory ability and in some cases even up regulate heparanase gene expression [71]. Examining a series of tumor-derived cell lines, we have found that cells which exhibit heparanase activity also harbor at least one unmethylated allele [72], while cell lines which exhibit no heparanase expression or activity were found to harbor fully methylated alleles. Treating these cells with demethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine restored heparanase activity accompanied by augmented metastatic capacity in vivo [69, 72]. Cathepsin L plays a critical role in the processing and conversion of latent heparanase into its active form [73]. Interestingly, promoter methylation [74] and EGR family members are also involved in cathepsin L activation [75], suggesting that heparanase and cathepsin L share some regulatory aspects. Applying the RIP1-Tag2 tumor model, Joyce et al. demonstrated that while cathepsin L expression was restricted to tumor cells, the majority of heparanase appeared to originate from infiltrating immune cells [76]. Thus, pro-heparanase secreted from one cell type (inflammatory cells) can be activated by cathepsin L secreted by another compartment (cancer cells) in cooperation that drives tumor development [18]. Notably, regulation of both heparanase and cathepsin L does not rely solely on gene transcription but rather involves complex regulatory mechanisms. Important regulatory elements of cathepsin L were identified in 5\u2032, and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) of the gene [77]. Likewise, Arvatz et al. revealed post-transcriptional regulation of heparanase gene expression by a 3\u2032 AU-rich element in the 3\u2032UTR of the gene [78].",

Furthermore, secondary structure predictions suggested that heparanase is likely to contain an (alpha/beta) (8) TIM-barrel fold, which is common to the GH-A families. Based on sequence alignments with a number of glycosyl hydrolases from GH-A, Glu(225) and Glu(343) of human heparanase were identified as the likely proton donor and nucleophile residues, respectively. The substitution of these residues with alanine and the subsequent expression of the mutant heparanases in COS-7 cells demonstrated that the HS-degrading capacity of both was abolished. In contrast, the alanine substitution of two other glutamic acid residues (Glu(378) and Glu(396)), both predicted to be outside the active site, did not affect heparanase activity. These data suggest that heparanase is a member of the clan A glycosyl hydrolases and has a common catalytic mechanism that involves two conserved acidic residues, a putative proton donor at Glu(225) and a nucleophile at Glu(343) [80].\u2217First paper showing that heparanase is a member of the clan A glycosyl hydrolases and has a common catalytic mechanism that involves a putative proton donor at Glu(225) and a nucleophile at Glu(343).",

Excision of a 10-amino acid peptide located at the C terminus of the linker segment between two functional cathepsin L cleavage sites (Y156Q and Y146Q) was critical for activation of proheparanase.

A 3.5-kb promoter region of the HPR1 gene was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that the TATA-less, GC-rich promoter of the HPR1 gene belongs to the family of housekeeping genes. This 3.5-kb promoter region exhibited strong promoter activity in two thyroid tumor cell lines. Truncation analysis of the HPR1 promoter identified a minimal 0.3-kb region that had strong basal promoter activity. Truncation and mutational analysis of the HPR1 promoter revealed three Sp1 sites and four Ets-relevant elements (ERE) significantly contributing to basal HPR1 promoter activity. Binding to the Sp1 sites by Sp1 and to the ERE sites by GA-binding protein (GABP) was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competition and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Co-transfection of Sp- and GABP-deficient Drosophila SL-2 cells with the HPR1 promoter-driven luciferase construct plus the expression vector encoding the Sp1, Sp3, or GABP gene induced luciferase gene expression. Mutation or truncation of the Sp1 or ERE sites reduced luciferase expression in both SL-2 cells and thyroid tumor cell lines. Co-expression of GABPalpha/beta and Sp1 or Sp3 further increased luciferase reporter gene expression.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate for the first time that EGR1 binds to the heparanase gene promoter in vivo. The important question of the role of EGR1 in regulating heparanase transcription in tumor cells was then assessed. Studies were carried out in four epithelial tumor lines of different tissue origin. Functional dissection of the heparanase promoter identified a 280-bp region that was critical for transcription of the heparanase gene. Transactivation studies using an EGR1 expression vector co-transfected with a reporter construct containing the 280-bp region showed EGR1-activated heparanase promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in prostate or breast adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of EGR1 resulted in a dose-dependent repression of promoter activity in melanoma cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis the 280-bp region was found to contain two functional EGR1 sites and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed binding of EGR1 to both of these sites upon activation of tumor cells. Furthermore, the heparanase promoter region containing the EGR1 sites was also inducible in tumor cells and induction corresponded to HPSE expression levels. These studies show that EGR1 regulates heparanase transcription in tumor cells and importantly, can have a repressive or activating role depending on the tumor type [65].\u2217The above two studies indicate that heparanase gene expression is due to promoter hypomethylation and interaction with transcription factor EGR1 .",

Constructing the 3\u2032 UTR immediately following the heparanase cDNA reduces heparanase enzymatic activity and protein levels, resulting in decreased cellular invasion capacity. We further identified a 185-bp sequence within the 3\u2032 UTR that mediates heparanase down-regulation, and characterized an adenine (A)/uracil (U)-rich consensus element (ARE) within this region. Deletion of the entire 185-bp region or the ARE eliminated the inhibitory effect of the 3\u2032 UTR, resulting in elevated heparanase levels and formation of larger tumor xenografts indistinguishable from those produced by heparanase-overexpressing cells in terms of size, vascularization, and Akt activation. These results suggest that loss of the ARE is an important regulatory mechanism contributing to heparanase induction in human cancer [78].\u2217Heparanase expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by sequences at the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) of the gene .",

We found that miR-1258 levels inversely correlated with heparanase expression, enzymatic activity, and cancer cell metastatic propensities, being lowest in highly aggressive BMBC cell variants compared with either nontumorigenic or nonmetastatic human mammary epithelial cells. These findings were validated by analyses of miR-1258 and heparanase content in paired clinical specimens of normal mammary gland versus invasive ductal carcinoma, and primary breast cancer versus BMBC. In regulatory experiments, miR-1258 inhibited the expression and activity of heparanase in BMBC cells, whereas modulating heparanase blocked the phenotypic effects of miR-1258. In functional experiments, stable expression of miR-1258 in BMBC cells inhibited heparanase in vitro cell invasion and experimental brain metastasis.

The present study indicates a highly significant correlation of HPSE gene SNPs rs4693608 and rs4364254 and their combination with the risk of developing acute GVHD. Moreover, the study revealed that discrepancy between recipient and donor in these SNPs may elevate significantly the risk of acute GVHD.

In addition, HPSE gene SNPs disclosed a correlation with extensive chronic GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival.

Eb cells overexpressing the secreted heparanase invaded a reconstituted basement membrane to a much higher extent than cells overexpressing the intracellular enzyme. Cell invasion was inhibited in the presence of laminaran sulfate, a potent inhibitor of heparanase activity and experimental metastasis. The increased invasiveness in vitro was reflected in vivo by rapid and massive liver colonization and accelerated mortality. In fact, mice inoculated with cells expressing the secreted enzyme succumb because of liver metastasis and dysfunction, as early as 10 days after s.c. inoculation of the cells, when their tumor burden did not exceed 1% of body weight. Cell surface localization and secretion of heparanase markedly stimulated tumor angiogenesis, as demonstrated by a 4\u2013six-fold increase in vessel density and functionality evaluated by MRI of tumors produced by cells expressing the secreted vs. the non-secreted heparanase, consistent with actual counting of blood vessels.

TFPI accumulation in the cell culture medium exceeded in magnitude the observed induction of TFPI gene transcription reaching 5- to six-fold increase. Extracellular accumulation of TFPI correlated with increased coagulation activity. This effect was found to be independent of heparanase enzymatic activity and interaction with HS, and correlated with reduced TFPI levels on the cell surface. Interaction between heparanase and TFPI was evident by co-immunoprecipitation and resulted in TFPI displacement from the surface of the vascular endothelium. Thus, heparanase facilitates blood coagulation on the cell surface by two independent mechanisms: dissociation of TFPI from the vascular surface shortly after local elevation of heparanase levels, and subsequent induction of TF expression [92].\u2217See Nadir, Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-34521-1_33 in this volume for more information on heparanase and the coagulation system.",

We have discovered that in human cancer cells (myeloma, lymphoblastoid, and breast cancer), when expression of heparanase is enhanced or when tumor cells are exposed to exogenous heparanase, exosome secretion is dramatically increased. Heparanase enzyme activity is required for robust enhancement of exosome secretion because enzymatically inactive forms of heparanase do not dramatically increase exosome secretion. Heparanase also impacts exosome protein cargo as reflected by higher levels of syndecan-1, VEGF, and hepatocyte growth factor in exosomes secreted by heparanase-high expressing cells as compared with heparanase-low expressing cells. In functional assays, exosomes from heparanase-high cells stimulated spreading of tumor cells on fibronectin and invasion of endothelial cells through ECM better than did exosomes secreted by heparanase-low cells.

When myeloma cells were exposed to the commonly utilized anti-myeloma drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib or melphalan, exosome secretion by the cells was dramatically enhanced. These chemotherapy-induced exosomes ( chemoexosomes) have a proteome profile distinct from cells not exposed to drug including a dramatic elevation in the level of heparanase present as exosome cargo. Heparanase was present on the exosome surface where it was capable of degrading heparan sulfate embedded within an ECM. When exposed to myeloma cells, chemoexosomes transferred their heparanase cargo to those cells, enhancing their HS degrading activity and leading to activation of ERK signaling and an increase in shedding of the syndecan-1 proteoglycan. Exposure of chemoexosomes to macrophages enhanced their secretion of TNF-\u03b1, an important myeloma growth factor. Moreover, chemoexosomes stimulated macrophage migration and this effect was blocked by H1023, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity. These data suggest that anti-myeloma therapy ignites a burst of exosomes having a high level of heparanase that remodels ECM and alters tumor and host cell behaviors that likely contribute to chemoresistance and eventual patient relapse [103].\u2217Anti-myeloma chemotherapy dramatically stimulates secretion of exosomes and alters exosome composition.

However, the mechanism whereby this enzyme regulates gene expression remains unknown. We previously reported that elevation of heparanase levels in myeloma cells causes a dramatic reduction in the amount of syndecan-1 in the nucleus. Because HS has been shown to inhibit the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes in vitro, we hypothesized that the reduction in nuclear syndecan-1 in cells expressing high levels of heparanase would result in increased HAT activity leading to stimulation of protein transcription. We found that myeloma cells or tumors expressing high levels of heparanase and low levels of nuclear syndecan-1 had significantly higher levels of HAT activity when compared with cells or tumors expressing low levels of heparanase. High levels of HAT activity in heparanase-high cells were blocked by SST0001, an inhibitor of heparanase. Restoration of high syndecan-1 levels in heparanase-high cells diminished nuclear HAT activity, establishing syndecan-1 as a potent inhibitor of HAT. Exposure of heparanase-high cells to anacardic acid, an inhibitor of HAT activity, significantly suppressed their expression of VEGF and MMP-9, two genes known to be up-regulated following elevation of heparanase. These results reveal a novel mechanistic pathway driven by heparanase expression, which leads to decreased nuclear syndecan-1, increased HAT activity, and up-regulation of transcription of multiple genes that drive an aggressive tumor phenotype [104].",

Genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analyses showed that heparanase is recruited to both the promoter and transcribed regions of a distinct cohort of transcriptionally active genes. Knockdown and overexpression of the heparanase gene also showed that chromatin-bound heparanase is a prerequisite for the transcription of a subset of inducible immune response genes in activated T cells.

A predicted three-dimensional structure of constitutively active heparanase clearly delineates a TIM-barrel fold previously anticipated for the enzyme. Interestingly, the model also revealed the existence of a COOH-terminal domain (C-domain) that apparently is not an integral part of the TIM-barrel fold. We provide evidence that the C-domain is critical for heparanase enzymatic activity and secretion. Moreover, the C-domain was found to mediate nonenzymatic functions of heparanase, facilitating Akt phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and tumor xenograft progression. These findings support the notion that heparanase exerts enzymatic activity-independent functions, and identify, for the first time, a protein domain responsible for heparanase-mediated signaling. Inhibitors directed against the C-domain, combined with inhibitors of heparanase enzymatic activity, are expected to neutralize heparanase functions and to profoundly affect tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis [107].\u2217First paper on the heparanase C-terminal domain and signal transduction.",

PI-88 had significant effects at distinct stages of tumorigenesis, producing a reduction in the number of early progenitor lesions and an impairment of tumor growth at later stages. These responses were associated with decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, impaired angiogenesis, and a substantive reduction in the number of invasive carcinomas. In addition, we show that the reduction in tumor angiogenesis is correlated with a reduced association of VEGF-A with its receptor VEGF-R2 on the tumor endothelium, implicating heparanase in the mobilization of matrix-associated VEGF.

Strikingly, development of tumor xenografts produced by CAG-heparanase cells overexpressing CXCL10 was markedly reduced compared with control cells.

Frontline anti-myeloma drugs, bortezomib and carfilzomib activate the NF-\u03baB pathway to trigger heparanase expression in tumor cells. Blocking the NF-\u03baB pathway diminished this chemotherapy-induced upregulation of heparanase expression. Activated NF-\u03baB signaling was also found to drive high heparanase expression in drug resistant myeloma cell lines. In addition to enhancing heparanase expression, chemotherapy also caused release of heparanase by tumor cells into the conditioned medium. This soluble heparanase was taken up by macrophages and triggered an increase in TNF-\u03b1 production. Heparanase is also taken up by tumor cells where it induced expression of HGF, VEGF and MMP-9 and activated ERK and Akt signaling pathways. These changes induced by heparanase are known to be associated with the promotion of an aggressive tumor phenotype. Importantly, the heparanase inhibitor Roneparstat diminished the uptake and the downstream effects of soluble heparanase. Together, these discoveries reveal a novel mechanism whereby chemotherapy upregulates heparanase, a known promoter of myeloma growth, and suggest that therapeutic targeting of heparanase during anti-cancer therapy may improve patient outcome [118].\u2217See Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-34521-1_12 by Sanderson et al., for more information on heparanase and myeloma.",

Using histological specimens from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, we found that heparanase was constantly overexpressed and activated throughout the disease. We demonstrate, using heparanase-overexpressing transgenic mice, that heparanase overexpression markedly increased the incidence and severity of colitis-associated colonic tumors. We found that highly coordinated interactions between the epithelial compartment (contributing heparanase) and mucosal macrophages preserved chronic inflammatory conditions and created a tumor-promoting microenvironment characterized by enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling and induction of STAT3. Our results indicate that heparanase generates a vicious cycle that powers colitis and the associated tumorigenesis: heparanase, acting synergistically with the intestinal flora, stimulates macrophage activation, while macrophages induce production (via TNF-\u03b1-dependent mechanisms) and activation (via secretion of cathepsin L) of heparanase contributed by the colon epithelium. Thus, disruption of the heparanase-driven chronic inflammatory circuit is highly relevant to the design of therapeutic interventions in colitis and the associated cancer [121].\u2217Highly coordinated interactions between the epithelial compartment and mucosal macrophages generate a vicious cycle that powers colitis and the associated tumorigenesis.",

Ex vivo treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with heparanase resulted in the release of a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF. A similar pattern of cytokine release was also observed when cells were treated with soluble HS. Furthermore, heparanase-induced cytokine release was abolished by enzymatic-inhibitors of heparanase, suggesting that this process is mediated via the enzymatic release of cell surface HS fragments. As soluble HS can signal through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, heparanase may promote the upregulation of cytokines through the generation of heparanase-cleaved fragments of HS. In support of this hypothesis, mouse spleen cells lacking the key TLR adaptor molecule MyD88 demonstrated an abolition of cytokine release after heparanase stimulation. Furthermore, TLR4-deficient spleen cells showed reduced cytokine release in response to heparanase treatment, suggesting that TLR4 is involved in this response. Consistent with these observations, the pathway involved in cytokine upregulation was identified as being NF-\u03baB-dependent. These data identify a new mechanism for heparanase in promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that is likely to be important in regulating cell migration and inflammation [122].\u2217Heparanase triggers upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the generation of heparanase-cleaved fragments of HS.",

Here, using murine models of lymphoma, we determined that the antitumor effects of PG545 are critically dependent on NK cell activation and that NK cell activation by PG545 requires TLR9. We demonstrate that PG545 does not activate TLR9 directly but instead enhances TLR9 activation through the elevation of the TLR9 ligand CpG in DCs. Specifically, PG545 treatment resulted in CpG accumulation in the lysosomal compartment of DCs, leading to enhanced production of IL-12, which is essential for PG545-mediated NK cell activation.

Heparanase-dependent production of IL-8 was detected in two human colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Addition of a heparanase inhibitor Heparastatin (SF4) did not influence MCP-1 production, while both latent and mature forms of heparanase augmented MCP-1 release, suggesting that heparanase catalytic activity was dispensable for MCP-1 production. In contrast, addition of heparin to the medium suppressed MCP-1 release in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, targeted suppression of Ext1 by RNAi significantly suppressed cell surface expression of HS and MCP-1 production in colon 26 cells. Taken together, it is concluded that colon 26 cells transduce the heparanase-mediated signal through HS binding.

However, mice lacking heparanase specifically in NK cells (Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice) were highly tumor prone when challenged with the carcinogen methylcholanthrene (MCA). Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice were also more susceptible to tumor growth than were their littermate controls when challenged with the established mouse lymphoma cell line RMA-S-RAE-1\u03b2, which overexpresses the NK cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand RAE-1\u03b2, or when inoculated with metastatic melanoma, prostate carcinoma, or mammary carcinoma cell lines. NK cell invasion of primary tumors and recruitment to the site of metastasis were strictly dependent on the presence of heparanase. Cytokine and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for metastases was compromised when NK cells lacked heparanase. Our data suggest that heparanase plays a critical role in NK cell invasion into tumors and thereby tumor progression and metastases.

Although active tumor-mediated immunosuppression may have a role in limiting the efficacy of CAR-T cells, functional changes in T lymphocytes after their ex vivo manipulation may also account for the reduced ability of cultured CAR-T cells to penetrate stroma-rich solid tumors compared with lymphoid tissues. We therefore studied the capacity of human in vitro-cultured CAR-T cells to degrade components of the ECM. In contrast to freshly isolated T lymphocytes, we found that in vitro-cultured T lymphocytes lack expression of the enzyme heparanase (HPSE), which degrades heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the main components of ECM. We found that HPSE mRNA is downregulated in in vitro-expanded T cells, which may be a consequence of p53 (officially known as TP53, encoding tumor protein 53) binding to the HPSE gene promoter. We therefore engineered CAR-T cells to express HPSE and showed their improved capacity to degrade the ECM, which promoted tumor T cell infiltration and antitumor activity. The use of this strategy may enhance the activity of CAR-T cells in individuals with stroma-rich solid tumors [128].\u2217The above two papers show that heparanase plays a critical role in NK- and T- cell invasion into tumors.

Although T cell dependent, the molecular mechanisms triggering \u03b2 cell death have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that HS is expressed at extraordinarily high levels within mouse islets and is essential for \u03b2 cell survival. In vitro, \u03b2 cells rapidly lost their HS and died. \u03b2 Cell death was prevented by HS replacement, a treatment that also rendered the \u03b2 cells resistant to damage from ROS. In vivo, autoimmune destruction of islets in NOD mice was associated with production of catalytically active heparanase by islet-infiltrating MNCs and loss of islet HS. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with the heparanase inhibitor PI-88 preserved intra-islet HS and protected NOD mice from T1D. These results identified HS as a critical molecular requirement for islet \u03b2 cell survival and HS degradation as a mechanism for \u03b2 cell destruction.

Abnormal permselectivity of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) plays an important role in DN pathogenesis. Loss of GBM HS in diabetic kidney was associated with increased glomerular expression of heparanase pointing to the essential involvement of heparanase in DN. With the use of Hpse-KO mice, we found that deletion of the heparanase gene protects diabetic mice from DN. Furthermore, by investigating the molecular mechanism underlying induction of the enzyme in DN, we found that transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr1) is responsible for activation of heparanase promoter under diabetic conditions. The specific heparanase inhibitor SST0001 markedly decreased the extent of albuminuria and renal damage in mouse models of DN. Collectively these results underscore the crucial role of heparanase in the pathogenesis of DN and its potential as a highly relevant target for therapeutic interventions in patients with DN [132].",

            "text": " Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of CKD in the Western world. Endothelin receptor antagonists have emerged as a novel treatment for DN, but the mechanisms underlying the protective effect remain unknown. We previously showed that both heparanase and endothelin-1 are essential for the development of DN. Here, we further investigated the role of these proteins in DN, and demonstrated that endothelin-1 activates podocytes to release heparanase. Furthermore, conditioned podocyte culture medium increased glomerular transendothelial albumin passage in a heparanase-dependent manner. In mice, podocyte-specific knockout of the endothelin receptor prevented the diabetes-induced increase in glomerular heparanase expression, consequent reduction in heparan sulfate expression and endothelial glycocalyx thickness, and development of proteinuria observed in wild-type counterparts. Our data suggest that in diabetes, endothelin-1 signaling, as occurs in endothelial activation, induces heparanase expression in the podocyte, damage to the glycocalyx, proteinuria, and renal failure. Thus, prevention of these effects may constitute the mechanism of action of endothelin receptor blockers in DN [133].\u2217These and other studies underscore the crucial role of heparanase in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.\u2217See Chapters 10.1007/978-3-030-34521-1_27 and 10.1007/978-3-030-34521-1_28 by Massola et al., and by Abassi & Goligorsky, for more information on heparanase in fibrosis and kidney dysfunction [134, 135].",

Coronary LPL originates from cardiomyocytes, and to translocate to the vascular lumen, the enzyme requires liberation from myocyte surface HS, an activity that needs to be sustained after chronic hyperglycemia. We investigated the mechanism by which endothelial cells (EC) and cardiomyocytes operate together to enable continuous translocation of LPL after diabetes. EC were co-cultured with myocytes, exposed to high glucose, and uptake of endothelial heparanase into myocytes was determined. Upon uptake, the effect of nuclear entry of heparanase was also investigated. A streptozotocin model of diabetes was used to expand our in vitro observations. In high glucose, EC-derived latent heparanase was taken up by cardiomyocytes by a caveolae-dependent pathway using HSPGs. This latent heparanase was converted into an active form in myocyte lysosomes, entered the nucleus, and upregulated gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9. The net effect was increased shedding of HSPGs from the myocyte surface, releasing LPL for its onwards translocation to the coronary lumen. EC-derived heparanase regulates the ability of the cardiomyocyte to send LPL to the coronary lumen. This adaptation, although acutely beneficial, could be catastrophic chronically because excess FA causes lipotoxicity. Inhibiting heparanase function could offer a new strategy for managing cardiomyopathy observed after diabetes [136].\u2217See also comment entitled \u2018Heparanase shakes hands with lipoprotein lipase: a tale of two cells\u2019 [137].

We have tested the susceptibility of Hpa-tg mice to amyloid induction. Drastic shortening of HS chains was observed in heparanase-overproducing organs, such as liver and kidney. These sites selectively escaped amyloid deposition on experimental induction of inflammation-associated AA amyloidosis, whereas the same tissues from control animals were heavily infiltrated with amyloid. By contrast, the spleens of transgenic mice that failed to significantly overexpress heparanase remained susceptible to amyloid deposition.

However, in the presence of vascular injury, the time to thrombosis was dramatically reduced in HPA-Tg mice. An ex vivo system was used to flow blood from wild type and HPA-Tg mice over stents and stented arterial segments from both animal types. These studies demonstrate markedly increased thromboses on stents with blood isolated from HPA-Tg mice in comparison to blood from wild type animals.

We postulated that sepsis-associated ALI is initiated by degradation of the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx, leading to neutrophil adherence and inflammation. Using intravital microscopy, we found that endotoxemia in mice rapidly induced pulmonary microvascular glycocalyx degradation via tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-dependent mechanisms. Glycocalyx degradation involved the specific loss of heparan sulfate and coincided with activation of endothelial heparanase, a TNF-\u03b1-responsive, heparan sulfate-specific glucuronidase. Glycocalyx degradation increased the availability of endothelial surface adhesion molecules to circulating microspheres and contributed to neutrophil adhesion. Heparanase inhibition prevented endotoxemia-associated glycocalyx loss and neutrophil adhesion and, accordingly, attenuated sepsis-induced ALI and mortality in mice. These findings are potentially relevant to human disease, as sepsis-associated respiratory failure in humans was associated with higher plasma heparan sulfate degradation activity; moreover, heparanase content was higher in human lung biopsies showing diffuse alveolar damage than in normal human lung tissue [140].\u2217See additional studies on heparanase and the glycocalyx [133, 141].",

However, during a productive infection, the HS moieties on parent cells can trap newly exiting viral progenies and inhibit their release. Here we demonstrate that a HS-degrading enzyme of the host, heparanase (HPSE), is upregulated through NF-kB and translocated to the cell surface upon HSV-1 infection for the removal of HS to facilitate viral release. We also find a significant increase in HPSE release in vivo during infection of murine corneas and that knockdown of HPSE in vivo inhibits virus shedding. Overall, we propose that HPSE acts as a molecular switch for turning a virus-permissive \u2018attachment mode\u2019 of host cells to a virus-deterring \u2018detachment mode\u2019.

I became interested in cell interaction with the ECM about 40 years ago just before finishing my postdoctoral research under the supervision of Prof. Denis Gospodarowicz (UCSF). We were among the first to realize that the ECM plays an active role in orchestrating cellular responses to both normal and pathological situations [149\u2013152]. The emerging concept was one of an active interplay between cells and the ECM where cells synthesize matrix components which in turn dictate and regulate cell shape and function. The impact of these studies is clearly indicated by the current awareness of the ECM and the tumor microenvironment as key elements in the regulation of cell survival and cancer progression. It was only a few years after my return to Israel that I became interested in degradation of the ECM\u2019 HS as a mean to understand better how tumor cells enter and exit blood vessels in the process of cancer metastasis. I decided to focus on HS knowing that this polyanionic polysaccharide binds to other constituents of the ECM and plays an important role in assembling and stabilizing the entire supramolecular structure of the ECM. It was then that I became interested in the heparanase enzyme, a topic that kept me busy since then. Our first papers on heparanase and cancer metastasis were published in 1983 [152], in parallel to studies reported by Dr. Nicolson et al. [44]. Next, we reported on the sequential mode of heparanase action in degrading the ECM [46], its inhibition by species of heparin [51, 153] and expression by platelets [154], neutrophils [155] and activated cells of the immune system. An important concept was brought about in studies performed during a sabbatical with Michael Klagsbrun and the late Judah Folkman (Harvard Medical Center) revealing that HS in the ECM provides a storage depot for FGF2, and hence heparanase regulates its bioavailability [16, 49, 50]. The concept of ECM as a reservoir for bioactive molecules became well recognized and is of prime importance to the current appreciation of the tumor microenvironment and its significance in cancer progression and treatment.",

            "text": "These and other studies further emphasized the need to purify the heparanase protein and clone the respective gene, an objective that took a long time and was finally achieved at 1999 [4] and published back to back with a study performed by the group of Cristopher Parish in Canberra [1]. Gene cloning enabled studies on the modes of heparanase gene regulation, cellular uptake, lysosomal storage and activation [31, 34, 144, 156, 157]. We and others further revealed the modes of heparanase action in eliciting angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and signal transduction. Thus, 20 years following its cloning, the functional repertoire of heparanase and the complexity of the system are still being revealed. From activity mainly implicated in cell invasion associated with tumor metastasis, heparanase has turned into a multifaceted protein that appears to participate in essentially all major aspects of tumor progression and in the pathogenesis of other diseases. Importantly, the crystal structure of the heparanase protein was resolved [87], paving the way for rational design and optimization of site-directed heparanase-inhibiting small molecules and monoclonal antibodies. As a direct result of these and subsequent studies performed by other groups and us, heparanase was advanced from being an obscure enzyme with a poorly understood function to a highly promising, novel drug target, offering new treatment strategies for various cancers and other diseases (i.e., chronic inflammation, diabetic nephropathy). The significance of heparanase as a valid target for anti-cancer drug development was reinforced by studies indicating a marked inhibition of human myeloma, lymphoma, glioma, sarcoma, mesothelioma and pancreatic tumor growth in mice treated with heparin-like heparanase-inhibiting compounds (i.e., SST0001 = Roneparstat, PG545 = Pixatimod) that are being examined in clinical trials alone and in combination with other drugs [159, 160]. Unfortunately, we are not yet there raising the question/dilemma if it was wise to focus and invest so much time, energy and effort in the study of a single molecule. Do we really understand the mode of heparanase action in tumorigenesis?; Should we adopt another way of thinking?; Should we focus on other diseases?; Where we objective and unbiased in our interpretations of the results?; What mistakes, if any, were done along the way?; Should the final goal of a basic scientist is to translate his findings into a drug?; Was it worth? etc. (see also Ilan et al., Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-34521-1_9 in this volume). Obviously, there are no simple and clear cut answers. Focusing on one molecule is risky and, nowadays in the era of \u2018big science\u2019, is regarded as an \u2018old fashion\u2019 approach. Yet, the heparanase journey is actively ongoing and should be evaluated in the broad context of cell interaction with the ECM and tumor microenvironment. In fact, heparanase research markedly reinforced the significance of the ECM in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation [149\u2013152]. It led to important and often unexpected observations in diverse normal and pathological processes including, wound healing, angiogenesis [63], autophagy [98], signal transduction [107, 156, 161], protein trafficking [162], lysosomal secretion [144, 163], blood coagulation [92, 164], epithelial-mesenchymal transition [165], activation of immune cells [21, 121\u2013123], exosome formation [99, 100, 102], drug resistance [34, 166], gene transcription [35, 104] and others. While most studies emphasize the involvement of heparanase in cancer progression, other pathologies were investigated. Among these are diabetes [35, 131], diabetic complications (i.e., diabetic nephropathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy) [132, 136, 167], kidney dysfunction [38], fibrosis [134, 168], inflammatory disorders (i.e., neuroinflammation, pancreatitis, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, sepsis) [121, 140, 169, 170], amyloidosis [138], atherosclerosis [39, 40, 171] and others. Interestingly, heparanase accomplishes all these by exerting both enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions that are mostly HS-dependent yet in some cases are HS-independent [172]. In comparison with other ECM degrading enzymes (i.e., MMPs, cathepsins) [173, 174] the heparanase field is small, leaving enough room for other research groups to join and make significant contributions to basic and translational aspects. For example, little is known about a putative non-HS heparanase receptor [107, 175\u2013178] that binds the enzyme and mediates its downstream signaling function. Likewise, in-depth research is needed to elucidate better the mode of heparanase nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity [104, 105], as well as its ability to activate macrophages and mediate their polarization [121\u2013124]. An open area, not referred to in this review, has to do with heparanase-2 (Hpa2), a heparanase homolog devoid of heparanase enzymatic activity [146, 147, 178]. Of particular interest is to resolve the crystal structure of Hpa2, elucidate its mode of action as a tumor suppressor and reveal the significance of its crosstalk with heparanase [144]. Of prime importance from a translational point of view, is to apply the crystal structure of heparanase for rational design of heparanase-inhibiting small molecules, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and HS-mimicking compounds endowed with good pharmacokinetics and examine their efficiency in animal models and cancer patients.",
