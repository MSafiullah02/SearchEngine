These agents are related to a broad range of clinical features including gastroenteritis mainly but also hepatitis, neurological manifestations, and others. The main representatives in humans are rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV) [1, 2, 3].",

Surfaces are generally classified as porous (e.g., papers and clothes) or nonporous (e.g., stainless steel, plastic, and glass). Available data suggest that the majority of viruses persist longer on nonporous surfaces [7]; however, results are sometimes conflicting, and the effect of fomite properties might also depend on the viral type. For example, rotavirus seem to survive very well on nonporous surfaces, while results are very variable for porous ones [13]. Poliovirus has been shown to be particularly susceptible to aluminum. By comparing HAV and rotavirus, it has been shown that HAV is more resistant on nonporous materials, while rotavirus is more stable on porous surfaces such as paper [12]. In similar conditions, astroviruses are able to persist for up to 90 days on paper, while they survive for a maximum of 60 days on nonporous surfaces [14].",

These factors largely affect the resistance to desiccation, which appears to be an important determinant of virus survival on fomites [5]. For most enteric viruses, low temperatures have been reported to promote a longer persistence [11]. The effect of humidity is less consistent. It has been reported that decreases in humidity could affect the infectivity of HAV, rotavirus, and adenovirus [12]. Another study found that HAV was further preserved at a low humidity [15]. Conflicting results have also been described for other enteric viruses [11]. Indeed, it has been suggested that viruses have a better survival at both low and high humidity, while intermediate humidity (e.g., between 40 and 70%) is deleterious [16]. Overall, the humidity level is thought to play an important role in virus persistence in the environment, and it has been suggested to explain the seasonality of rotavirus infections, for example [17]. Nevertheless, in most studies, relative humidity (temperature dependent) has been reported, while some authors have shown more recently that absolute humidity (temperature independent) rather than relative humidity could explain the seasonality of infections [18]. Absolute humidity shows a high correlation between indoor and outdoor conditions [19], and it could be more useful to explain infections occurring in closed environments, such as norovirus outbreaks [18].",

In a more recent study, a significant rate (14%) was detected on environmental surfaces in a hospital intensive care unit [24]. Toys were associated with a rotavirus outbreak in a pediatric oncology unit [25]. Beyond detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, infectious particles have been reported in some cases [24]. Noroviruses have been found on surfaces and objects around patients during outbreaks in hospitals, hotels, or cruise ships [7, 26, 27]. The role of contamination of environmental surfaces such as dining room tables or elevator buttons used by staff has been reported in a norovirus outbreak in a long-term care center [28]. Touching a reusable grocery bag was linked to cases in a norovirus outbreak in a soccer team [29]. A high rate of norovirus contamination (58%) in environmental swabs has been observed during outbreaks [30].",

The virus is highly infectious and 10-100 virions are enough to cause gastroenteritis. To date, human norovirus cannot be propagated in mammalian cell lines. Therefore, survival and inactivation studies are commonly conducted using cultivable surrogates such as feline calicivirus (FCV) or murine norovirus (MNV) [40]. Doultree et al. [41] assessed FCV survival on glass and glass coverslips. The virus remained infectious for up to 57 days at 4\u00b0C and the resistance decreased significantly with higher temperatures. D'Souza et al. [42] also found that FCV survived for more than 7 days at room temperature on stainless steel, ceramic, and formica surfaces. A shorter survival ranging from 8-12 h (keyboard keys and brass) to 2-3 days (telephone buttons and telephone receivers) was reported on uncommon fomites. Unlike norovirus, which is an enteric pathogen, FCV causes respiratory diseases in cats and is not an ideal surrogate. MNV has been reported to be more applicable as a norovirus surrogate because it shows environmental stability and is genetically close to human norovirus [43]. Kim et al. [40] investigated MNV survival on steel and wood, and a better resistance was shown on wood at lower temperature and higher relative humidity values. In another study conducted at room temperature, the authors demonstrated that MNV could survive for up to 28 days on 6 different surfaces and the rank order of infectivity reduction from highest to lowest was stainless steel, plastic, rubber, glass, ceramic, and wood [44]. Human norovirus, MNV, and FCV were found to remain infective beyond 70 days on stainless steel and plastic both at 7\u00b0C and at room temperature [45].",

Enteroviruses can cause gastrointestinal symptoms; however, studies investigating the role of nonpolio enteroviruses in acute diarrhea are rare compared to those on major agents such as rotavirus [51]. Enteroviruses are involved in various and numerous acute diseases, and their role in chronic cardiac diseases and type 1 diabetes is highly suspected [52]. Data on the survival of enteroviruses are scarce, with only few old data focusing on the poliovirus prototype. Poliovirus can survive for up to 1 month at 4\u00b0C. Feces increase survival, while a rapid decrease has been observed on aluminum surfaces [12]. Recently our team investigated the survival of Coxsackievirus B4 on an inanimate surface. When the virus was dried on a petri dish lid at 20\u00b0C, infectious particles could be detected for up to 5 weeks. CVB4 was especially susceptible to repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension, with a significant decrease in the viral titer at each cycle. The viability of CVB4 was also highly reduced when the virus was dried in a protein-rich medium [53].",

MNV is completely inactivated within 30 min on copper. The highest rate of inactivation occurs upon immediate contact and is proportional to the copper content of alloys.

However, the use of multiple surrogate viruses rather than one is more judicious and recommended to obtain more reliable information on the effectiveness of disinfectants and this has been well documented in some studies [73, 75]. Indeed, differences in the sensitivity of the surrogates to experimental conditions and inactivation treatments have been reported. Some studies have shown that MNV is more susceptible to alcohols than FCV, whereas FCV is more susceptible to chlorine [76, 77]. In a systematic meta-analysis, Hoelzer et al. [73] showed that HAV and MNV were significantly more resistant to disinfection than FCV, even if the differences in viral titer reduction appeared to be modest (i.e., 1.5 log PFU) [73].",

In another study FCV applied on a surface, but not in suspension, was effectively inactivated by a quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant, while CVB4, an enterovirus, was resistant [80]. Ethanol has shown minimal efficacy against human norovirus and FCV, but it is active against MNV, with a clear dose-dependent impact [76, 81, 82, 83]. Very high concentrations of hypochlorite (\u2265500 ppm) are necessary to inactivate human norovirus and MNV; FCV has been shown to be more susceptible to hypochlorite than human noroviruses [76, 79, 81].",
