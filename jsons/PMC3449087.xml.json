The versatility in speed, amplitude and spatial-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling allows for control of cellular processes by modulating the activity of a repertoire of signaling components, including receptors, ion channels, pumps, exchangers, Ca2+ buffers, Ca2+ effectors, Ca2+-sensitive enzymes and transcriptional factors, in a number of cell compartments [3].",

Ca2+ has been found to play a role in almost every step in virus replication cycles. The interplay between viruses and Ca2+ in the infected cell falls in general into three major categories: (1) viral proteins directly or indirectly disturb Ca2+ homeostasis by altering membrane permeability and/or manipulating key components of the Ca2+-signaling apparatus; (2) viral proteins directly bind to Ca2+ for structural integrity or functionality; and (3) critical virus\u2013host interactions depend on cellular Ca2+-regulated proteins or pathways. This review, which aims to stimulate future studies on the roles of Ca2+ in virus infection, is focused on such interplay by highlighting recent discoveries in the biological roles of Ca2+ in virus infection.",

Two HIV-1 proteins, the membrane glycoprotein gp120 and the transcriptional transactivator Tat, have been shown to induce the elevation of [Ca2+]CYT in both excitable cells (such as neuronal cells) and non-excitable cells (such as immune cells and epithelial cells) by modulating the activity of VOC and/or ROC. External application of recombinant gp120 to fetal neurons and astrocytes causes a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]CYT up to \u223c2 \u03bcM and further induces neurotoxicity in these cells [33], [34]. As demonstrated by using selective channel antagonists or blockers, the increase in [Ca2+]CYT is attributable to the activation of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors on the plasma membrane. In addition, similar gp120-induced elevation of [Ca2+]CYT has been found in presynaptic terminals of rat cortical synaptosomes [35] and human intestinal epithelial cells HT-29-D4 [36], and the latter effect is related to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 related enteropathy. These findings suggest that drugs blocking gp120-induced intracellular Ca2+ changes in the human brain might be potential candidates for the treatment of HIV-1 dementia and enteropathy.",

            "text": "The HIV-1 protein Tat upregulates the viral gene expression and replication allowing HIV-1 to replicate in unactivated T cells. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+, due to increased Ca2+ influx via NMDA type glutamate receptor and the release of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive internal stores via IP3R, is observed in Tat-treated fetal neurons, astrocytes and microglia cells [37], [38], [39]. The Tat-induced dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ leads to neurotoxicity and contributes to HIV-related dementia. In non-excitable human monocytes, Tat promotes extracellular Ca2+ influx to the cytoplasm via the dihydropyridine (DHP) sensitive L-type Ca2+ channel and further stimulates the production of pro-inflammation cytokine TNF-\u03b1 [40]. TNF-\u03b1 plays a major role in progression to AIDS by directly activating NF-\u03baB to promote HIV-1 replication [41]. The tight link between Tat-induced Ca2+ mobilization and TNF-\u03b1 production provides excellent opportunities to develop effective therapeutic approaches targeting Tat and DHP sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels to attenuate HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, studies in other immune cells suggest that HIV-1 Tat inhibits Ca2+ entry in human natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DC). Exogenous Tat impairs the cytotoxic activity of NK cells [42] and inhibits apoptotic body engulfment and IL-12 production in DC [43] by blocking L-type Ca2+ channel channels. Tat-induced opposition effects on L-type Ca2+ channels in different types of immune cells is not surprising, since both the stimulating effects on monocytes and the inhibitory effects on NK and DC synergically facilitate the efficient replication and immune evasion of HIV-1.",

            "text": "In addition to HIV-1, viruses harboring RNA genomes are also able to elicit alteration in [Ca2+]CYT via plasma membrane Ca2+ entry pathways. Rotaviruses are members of the Reoviridae family that contain double-stranded RNA genomes and are the major etiological agent of viral gastroenteritis in young children. Ca2+ plays a key role in the replication of rotaviruses and pathogenesis of rotavirus infection [44]. Rotavirus-infected monkey kidney cells MA104 and the colon carcinoma HT29 cells have been shown to exhibit a progressive elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ due to increased membrane permeability at early times postinfection (4\u20138 hpi) [45]. The entry of Ca2+ is partially blocked by the L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels blocker metoxyverapamil (D600) in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, the permeability pathway is selectively permeable for the passage of divalent ions that include Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Mn2+ and Co2+, but is impermeable to the trivalent cations La3+ and Cr3+. Such metal ion selectivity is observed commonly in divalent cation channels in both excitable and non-excitable cells [46]. These lines of evidence suggest that rotavirus-induced external Ca2+ entry pathway is characteristic of a Ca2+ channel rather than nonselective impairment of the plasma membrane. Such early activation of Ca2+ entry is speculated to maintain an elevated ER Ca2+ pool that is required for virion maturation and stability [47], [48].",

In B lymphocytes, EBV infection can induce a rise in [Ca2+]CYT due to increased Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space [49]. The rise in intracellular Ca2+ can be blocked by verapamil, a L-type Ca2+-channel blocker [50]. In human fibroblasts infected by another herpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus (CMV, or HHV-5), a similar rise in [Ca2+]CYT is also observed. This effect can be blocked by L-type Ca2+-channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil [51].

In contrast, only a few non-excitable cells possess VOC or ROC. Alternative Ca2+ entry pathways have to evolve to meet demands on Ca2+ in these cells. It has been noted for over two decades that the depletion of ER Ca2+ stores often triggers sustained Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. This Ca2+ permeabilization pathway, known as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and characterized by a calcium release-activated calcium current (I\nCRAC), tightly links intracellular Ca2+ release with Ca2+ influx and provides a means to refill the Ca2+ stores [52] (Fig. 2). However, the molecular basis responsible for SOCE has remained enigmatic during the past two decades. Not surprisingly, only a few studies reported virus-induced activation of SOCE. Among those, p12I encoded by the retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) [13] and the core protein encoded by the single-strand RNA flavivirus hepatitis C virus (HCV) [15] have been reported to induce ER Ca2+ depletion and further trigger opening of CRAC channels in T cells or Jurkat T cells. A sustained elevation of [Ca2+]CYT and accompanying high frequency cytosolic Ca2+ oscillation specifically activate the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), a transcriptional factor that initiates a highly coordinated choreography of gene expression [53]. Activation of NFAT exerts long-term effects on immune cells by inducing gene expression (e.g., IL-2 and Bcl-2) and promoting lymphocyte activation and survival, thereby supporting viral infection (Fig. 2). In addition, p12I has also been shown to interact with Ca2+-responsive transcription coactivator, p300, to mediate various transcription factors and further promote infected lymphocyte survival [54].",

            "text": "An alternative mechanism to sabotage Ca2+ homeostasis is achieved by targeting Ca2+ extrusion components, such as PMCA. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a simple virus (4 genes) belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family. Although HBV harbors a DNA genome, it replicates through an RNA intermediate and thus is more closely related to the retroviruses than to other DNA virus families. Overexpression of HBV X protein (HBx) in HepG2 and HeLa cells has been reported to stimulate caspase-3-dependent cleavage of PMCA, a pump that extrudes Ca2+ from cytoplasm to the outside [31]. The decrease in PMCA activity, as well as HBx-mediated release of mitochondrial Ca2+\n[60], leads to a net increase in [Ca2+]CYT that enhances HBV DNA replication [61] and favors HBx-mediated Ca2+-responsive signaling pathways, including NFAT [62], [63], SAPK/JNK and MAPK pathways [60]. These pathways are closely involved in the regulation of cell survival, apoptosis and proliferation. In addition, the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ triggers the activation of a Ca2+-dependent proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2, which in turn activates the Src kinase and up-regulates reverse transcription [61]. More strikingly, such effects exerted by HBx can be substituted with simple increase in cytosolic Ca2+, suggesting that Ca2+ is a fundamental requirement for HBV replication and infection. More than that, the HBX-induced increase in [Ca2+] has also been shown to enhance HBV core assembly [64]. Treatment of infected HepG2 cells with the cell-permeable Ca2+-chelator BAPTA-AM and cyclosporine A results in reduced HBV capsid assembly, whereas the application of thapsigargin, a strong inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), increased HBV core assembly [64].",

The activated NFAT, a transcriptional factor responding to the low-amplitude intracellular Ca2+ oscillation, can further promote the viral gene transcription and replication [12]. The increase in cytosolic Ca2+ by Nef has also been demonstrated in differentiated myelomonocytic HL60 cells [68]. In addition, it is interesting to note that a Src-like protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) coimmunoprecipitate with both Nef and the IP3R.

HCV core-induced ER stress further activates the pro-apoptotic Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) [29], [30] (Fig. 2), which induces opening of the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel, cytochrome c release, apoptosis, and eventually, liver damage and even oncogenesis [69].",

In addition, endogenous NSP4 can also be secreted from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells [72] or released outside after cell lysis, thus exerting exogenous action on neighboring non-infected cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that the NSP4-induced Ca2+ mobilization is linked to the stimulation of chloride secretion and diarrhea [73].

            "text": "The 2B-induced, substantial decrease (\u223c40%) of Ca2+ in ER and Golgi complex serves two purposes: (i) it inhibits intracellular protein trafficking pathways, thus favoring virus replication and down-regulating host anti-viral immune response [79]. A reduced intravesicular Ca2+ level would result in the inhibition of vesicular protein transport and accumulation of ER/Golgi-derived vesicles, where the replication complex forms and viral RNA replication takes place. (ii) It exerts an anti-apoptotic activity on infected cells. Upon enterovirus entry, the cellular apoptotic process is immediately triggered as an innate defense mechanism in response to infection, but is abruptly suppressed during the middle stage of infection. Overexpression of 2B in HeLa cells renders these cells resistant to cycloheximide and actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. The apoptotic process resumes at late stage after viral replication. The perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis at 2\u20134 hpi coincides with the inhibition of the apoptotic cell response triggered at about 2 hpi. Thus, the middle-stage interruption of apoptosis is linked to down-regulated ER-mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes that prevent cytotoxic Ca2+ overloading in mitochondria. In summary, 2B-induced reduction of Ca2+ in ER/Golgi provides the virus a favorable cellular environment and optimal time-window for viral RNA and protein synthesis. Thus, the exquisite synchronization of [Ca2+]CYT increase and anti-apoptotic activity allows virus particles to complete assembly before cell lysis [21], [24], [25].",

These findings suggest that p7 might be responsible for the flow of Ca2+ from ER to the cytoplasm in HCV-infected cells. The reconstituted channel can be blocked by the anti-viral drug amantadine or long-alkyl-chain iminosugar derivatives [80], which raises the possibility of aiming at p7 as a potential therapeutic target. Another HCV nonstructural protein NS5A, which is embedded on the ER membrane, has been shown to alter the intracellular Ca2+ levels by increasing ER Ca2+ efflux [81]. The released Ca2+ can be readily taken up by mitochondria and increase the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated ROS leads to a shift in cellular redox state and activates transcriptional factors including NF-\u03baB and STAT3, which promote cell growth and proliferation and protect hepatocytes from apoptosis, thereby preventing premature abortion of the virus life cycle [81].",

Endogenously expressed NSP4 in Sf9 insect cells and HEK293 can alter the ER membrane permeability and therefore cause a sustained increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that is independent of the PLC pathway [71], [82]. By using a liposome leakage assay that monitors the release of fluorescent dye from calnexin-loaded liposomes mimicking ER membrane, the membrane destabilization activity of NSP4 is mapped to residues 114\u2013135 [84]. This membrane destabilization activity (MDA) seems to be quite specific to ER, since neither the full NSP4 protein nor the NSP4 fragment (114\u2013135) exerts MDA on plasma membrane.",

Expression of pUL37 \u00d7 1 has been shown to induce Ca2+ release 4-6 hpi from the ER store with concomitant cell morphological changes, such as cell rounding, cell swelling, actin cytoskeleton reorganization and mitochondrial fission [19]. The altered Ca2+-signaling has two cytobiological consequences: (i) the Ca2+ released from ER is taken up by nearby mitochondria and accelerates energy metabolism to generate sufficient ATP for active virus replication by activating Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial enzymes. (ii) A lower ER Ca2+ store level exerts protective effects on ceramide-induced apoptosis [22], [23]. In addition, vMIA directly interacts with the host pro-apoptotic protein Bax via its C-terminal domain (residues 115\u2013147) and recruits Bax from cytosol to mitochondria [26]. In this way, vMIA sequesters Bax at the mitochondrial membrane in an inactive form and blocks Bax-mediated apoptosis [26], [27].",

The change in membrane permeability is independent of PTP with neither release of cytochrome c nor commitment to apoptosis [93]. Moreover, Ca2+ uptake is not inhibited by the addition of ruthenium red (a Ca2+ uniporter antagonist), suggesting that Ca2+ uniporter does not play a role in Ca2+ flux [94]. All these findings indicate that p13II, like HCV p7 [80] and Coxsakievirus 2B [77], might function as a viroporin and alter membrane permeability by directly forming pores on IMM.

Tobacco mosaic virus, a typical helical virus, has been shown to bind Ca2+ with apparent affinities <100 \u03bcM [97], [98]. With the extracellular Ca2+ concentration at the mM range, such an affinity would ensure a tight binding of Ca2+ to capsid proteins. Among viruses with icosahedral symmetry, the numbers of bound Ca2+ ions and coordinating geometry of the Ca2+-binding sites differ in that the Ca2+ ions may be situated between the interacting interfaces of capsid subunits (Fig. 3A) or sit on the symmetric 3-fold or 5-fold axis (Fig. 3B). For example, the virion of cocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV), a plant Sobemovirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, has an icosacahedral capsid composed of 180 copies of the coat protein monomer assembled in T\n = 3 quasi-equivalent symmetry [108]. The monomer, which contains 253 amino acids, has a jelly-roll \u03b2-sandwich topology and can assume one of three slightly different conformations, denoted as quasi-equivalent A, B and C subunits. These subunits are assembled into asymmetric units which then coalesce to form the icosahedral capsid. Three Ca2+ ions, each incorporated between the interacting surfaces of subunits (A\u2013B, B\u2013C and A\u2013C), function as reusable \u201cglue\u201d to stick adjacent subunits together and stabilize the capsid. Each Ca2+ ion is coordinated by O\u03b41 of residues D136 and D139 from one subunit and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of L196, O\u03b41 of N252, the C-terminal carboxyl oxygen of L253 from the other interacting subunit (Fig. 3A). Such Ca2+-binding sites seem to adopt an octahedral geometry with only five protein ligands and an average Ca\u2013O distance of 2.4 \u00c5 [108], [109], [110].",

Site 2 within the F protein and Site 3 within the G spike protein are on the 3-fold and 5-fold axes of symmetry, respectively. While the binding of Ca2+ ions to Site 2 and Site 3 stabilizes the capsid, binding to Site 1 is functionally important in attachment to the host cell and injection of viral DNA [115], [116]. Similarly, the virion proteins of the animal single-stranded DNA-containing parvoviruses, feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvorius (CPV), bind three and two Ca2+ ions, respectively [117] (Fig. 3C). CPV emerged in 1978 as a host range variant of FPV. Both FPV and CPV contain a pH-dependent dual Ca2+-binding site in which the metal ions are separated by 4.6 \u00c5. The primary structural difference between the virion proteins of these two viruses is within a flexible surface loop located within residues 359\u2013375 of the coat protein VP2 which is thought to interact with surface molecules on the host cell. This loop forms a third Ca2+-binding site (Site 1, Fig. 3C) in FPV, but not in CPV. The binding of Ca2+ to this particular site causes conformational changes in VP2 and may influence the host range of these related, but different, parvoviruses [117].",

Nevertheless, some Ca2+ mutants were capable of forming virus-like particles (VLPs); however these were found to be less infectious than wild type VLPs. Interestingly, some of the mutants fail to enter the cell (e.g., E330K in Site 1) while others enter the cells, but fail to migrate to the nucleus (e.g., E157A-E160A and E216K in Site 2) due to an inability to bind Ca2+ leading to premature dissociation.

This activity is required for the release of virus from the cell surface. Two distinct Ca2+-binding sites are found in the neuraminidase [106], [120]. One high-affinity site (Fig. 3D) is close to the active site and adopts an octahedral geometry with six coordinating ligands including the carboxyl group of the side chain of D323, the carbonyl groups of the main chains of G343, G345, T296, D292 and one molecule of water. This Ca2+-binding site is conserved among influenza A virus [120], [121], influenza B virus [106] and the parainfluenza viruses [122]. The other site is a relatively low-affinity site, located on the 4-fold axis of the tetrameric neuraminidase of the influenza B viruses. The high-affinity Ca2+-binding site is needed for the thermostability and optimal activity of the enzyme, whereas the low-affinity site has been postulated to hold the tetramer together [107].",

NSP4 also functions as an enterotoxin, triggering ER Ca2+ release, as discussed above, that eventually results in gastrointestinal symptoms [82], [99]. NSP4 itself contains a core Ca2+-binding site when it oligomerizes into a functional homo-tetramer [123]. The Ca2+ ion is coordinated by the side chains of four Q123 and two E120 residues from the four identical polypeptides within the tetramer (Fig. 3E). Ca2+-binding at this site appears to stabilize the NSP4 tetramer [71].",

The motif contains a helix-loop-helix topology, much like the spread thumb and forefinger of the human hand, in which the Ca2+ ions are coordinated ligands within the loop, including seven oxygen atoms from the sidechain carboxyl or hydroxyl groups (loop sequence positions 1, 3, 5, 12), a main chain carbonyl group (position 7), and a bridged water (position 9) (Fig. 4A and B) [124]. The Ca2+-binding pocket thus adopts a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry [125]. The EF-hand motif is one of the most widely used motifs among proteins and is distributed across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes [126], [127]. Upon binding to Ca2+, this motif may undergo conformational changes that enable Ca2+-regulated functions as seen in Ca2+ effectors such as calmodulin (CaM) (Fig. 4C) and troponin C (TnC) and Ca2+ buffers such as calreticulin and calbindin D9k. While the majority of the known EF-hand CaBPs contain paired EF-hand motifs, CaBP's with single EF hands have also been discovered in both bacteria and eukaryotes [127], [128]. In addition, \u201cEF-hand-like motifs\u201d have been found in a number of bacteria [127]. Although their coordination properties remain similar to the canonical 29-residue helix-loop-helix EF-hand motif, the EF-hand-like motifs differ from EF-hands in that they contain deviations in the secondary structure of the flanking sequences and/or variation in the length of the Ca2+-coordinating loop (Fig. 4D).",

            "text": "Our laboratory has developed a pattern search algorithm to predict continuous Ca2+-binding sites from genomic information (http://www.chemistry.gsu.edu/faculty/Yang/Calciomics.htm). This tool has been successfully applied to predict and analyze potential EF-hand and EF-hand like Ca2+-binding motifs in bacterial proteins at a genome-wide level [127]. Given the widespread occurrence of EF-hand motifs in cell proteins and the importance of Ca2+ as an intracellular messenger, it is surprising that only four of these motifs were reported in viral proteins. We therefore initiated a comprehensive search for potential viral EF-hand motifs by screening all of the viral genomic information available on the protein database Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL with both our algorithm [127] and the prediction motif signature PS00018 (http://ca.expasy.org/prosite/PDOC00018) from the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) proteomic server and detected an additional 93 putative EF-hand and EF-hand-like motifs (summarized in Supplementary Table 3) in proteins encoded by the genomes of almost 80 different viruses, covering the majority of virus families. In contrast to EF-hand motifs in cellular proteins, almost all of these predictions were single EF-hand motifs. The exceptions were putative dual EF-hand or EF-hand-like motifs in the envelope protein of HIV-1 and the immediate-early protein RSP40 of pseudorabies virus (a Herpesvirus). These putative EF-hand motif-containing proteins are involved in a wide range of viral processes, including attachment and entry (neuraminidase of Influenza A virus, Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus 1; envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1; spike protein of rat coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus and bovine ephemeral fever virus; glycoprotein B of feline herpersvirus 1), virion structure (coat protein of beet yellow stunt virus, papaya ringspot virus and African horse sickness virus), precursor protein processing (nonstructural protease of rubella virus), nucleic acid modification and replication (mRNA-capping enzyme of alphavirus; RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of tobamovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus; DNA methylase of sulfolobus virus; DNA polymerase of nucleopolyherosis virus and human herpesvirus 2), and transcriptional regulators (ICP0 of bovine herpesvirus 1; IE63 of human herpesvirus 3; ICP4 of equine herpesvirus 1). In addition, the functions of almost 20% of the proteins with predicted Ca2+-binding motifs remain uncharacterized.",

            "text": "Subsequent to prediction of EF-hand and EF-hand-like Ca2+ motifs in viral proteins, experimental validation is required (Fig. 5\n). As a model, we used the putative EF-hand motif (DASPDGTGDPLD) predicted in the rubella virus nonstructural (NS) protease. Rubella virus (RUBV) is a positive-polarity, single-strand RNA virus in the Togavirus family. The NS protease, a papain-like cysteine protease with a Cys-His catalytic dyad, is a domain in a nonstructural polyprotein which functions to replicate the virus RNA through use of a complementary negative polarity RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells [131]. The NS protease makes a single cleavage within the initial polyprotein precursor (\u223c2200 aa) to produce two products (\u223c1300 and 900 aa). In addition to being large polyproteins, the RUBV nonstructural proteins are only made in extremely small amounts, necessitating expression in heterologous systems for analysis. We therefore used two approaches: bacterially expressing the region of the NS protease containing the EF-hand motif as a minidomain and grafting the putative EF-hand motif itself into a CD2 scaffold protein [130]. Both approaches succeeded in showing that this putative canonical EF-hand motif specifically binds Ca2+ but not Mg2+ and monovalent cations [130]. The Ca2+-binding affinity of this putative EF-hand was determined to be \u223c200\u2013300 \u03bcM, which agrees with the Ca2+ concentration of late endosomes and lysosomes (400\u2013600 \u03bcM) [132], [133], where the RUBV replication complex forms and replication occurs. The observed weak affinity is likely due to the presence of an Asp at the bidentate position 12 of the loop rather than a Glu, which ensures a high Ca2+-binding affinity due to its larger side chain and stronger interaction with Ca2+. Indeed, substitution of Glu at position 12 in CaM with Lys or Gln reduces Ca2+-binding affinity by 10\u2013100-fold [134]. Mutants (D-to-A mutations) of two of the predicted ligands at positions 5 and 12 of the loop were made in the CD2-grafted EF-hand motif and found to have lost the ability to bind Ca2+. When these mutations were introduced into the virus, NS protease activity was rendered temperature sensitive, indicating that the function of Ca2+ binding was in stabilizing the protease [130]. While several viral proteases have been shown to bind Zn2+ as a stabilizing factor (including the RUBV NS protease), this was the first demonstration of Ca2+ binding by a viral protease. These approaches can be employed to validate predicted EF-hand and EF-hand-like Ca2+ motifs in other virus proteins.",

It consists of two globular and autonomous domains, each of which contains two EF-hand motifs. Through its binding to Ca2+ and the concomitant conformational changes that result, CaM is capable of transducing the intracellular Ca2+ signal changes into divergent cellular events by binding to an array of cellular proteins [140], [141]. Two HIV proteins, Nef, an accessory protein, and gp160, the glycoprotein precursor, have been shown to interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. Nef is a myristoylated protein expressed early in infection. Nef has been shown to downregulate both CD4 and MHC-Class I cell surface receptors, both important in the cell mediated response, and to alter T lymphocyte signaling pathways. The latter effect is partially associated with its ability to strongly interact with CaM (with an apparent dissociation constant of 13.7 nM) [142]. The CaM-targeting sequence in Nef is contained within a 20-amino-acid basic domain at the N-terminus that shares a high degree of similarity with myristoylated neuron-specific protein kinase C substrate, NAP-22 [142], [143]. Besides Nef, both the precursor gp160/gp41 has been shown to interact with CaM [144], [145]. Two C-terminal CaM-targeting sequences in gp41 are shown to bind to CaM with dissociation constants of 31\u201341 nM [146]. Such interaction is speculated to disrupt the anti-apoptotic CaM signaling pathway by either reducing the amount of free cytosolic CaM or changing its subcellular localization [146]. The similar CaM-targeting sequence is also detected in simian immunodeficiency virus gp41 [147]. Adding more complexity to the scenario, the Gag gene products of HIV has been shown to interact with CaM [148]. The N terminus of p17 contains two contiguous CaM-binding sites, each of which binds CaM with affinities of \u223c109\n M. In view of the diverse roles of Ca2+/CaM-dependent signaling pathways, the interaction between all these HIV proteins with CaM is expected to play multiple roles to fit the HIV life cycle in response to altered Ca2+ signals.",

Two molecules of p11 serve as light chain components along with two heavy chains composed of annexin II to form the tetrameric calpactin complex. The calpactin complex is closely associated with Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and secretory pathways [149]. Since NS3 also interacts with the outermost core protein (VP2) of assembled virus particles, the BTV NS3 is proposed to bring the virions together with the calpactin complex via p11 and further direct the newly assembled virus particles to the cellular exocytic machinery in infected cells. Use of this cellular exocytosis pathway allows for nonlytic release of virus particles assembled within the infected cell.",

The HBV Pol protein plays multiple roles in virus replication by signaling the encapsidation and degradation of pgRNA, the RNA intermediate in the replication pathway, priming reverse transcription and catalyzing both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis [151]. The p11 protein is capable of recruiting HBV Pol to PML nuclear bodies, a region that is of vital importance for cell proliferation, differentiation and anti-viral responses. This interaction is affected by intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Treatment of cells with valinomycin, a drug that promotes Ca2+ influx, leads to a decrease of p11 in the nuclear bodies, whereas the blocking of Ca2+ influx by EGTA results in a marked increase of Pol-p11 complex in the nuclear bodies. Thus, it is expected that the virus would favor a higher cytosolic Ca2+ environment to avoid host anti-viral activities. In this regard, another HBV protein, the X protein, induces an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by reducing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and impairs the activity of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase [31].",

In addition to the nonstructural ORF containing the above-mentioned protease, the RUBV genome has a second ORF which encodes its virion structural proteins, capsid and glycoproteins E1 and E2. Both E1 and E2 have been demonstrated to interact with two Ca2+-binding ER chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin [153]. Calnexin is a membrane-bound Ca2+-binding ER chaperone that retains incorrectly or incompletely folded proteins [154]. Calreticulin consists of three domains, a globular N domain, a P domain rich in proline residues, and an acidic C-terminal tail domain. The N and P domains are responsible for the chaperone function and the highly acidic C-terminal tail is involved in buffering Ca2+ storage with high capacity (20\u201330 mol Ca2+/mol protein) [155]. Calreticulin functions as a molecular chaperone in facilitating the folding of a number of proteins in the ER. Its activity is influenced by changes in the ER, such as the concentration of Ca2+ and ATP. During posttranslational modification, virtually all glycoproteins associate with these two chaperones, which work in concert to supply \u201cquality control\u201d in secretory protein maturation by promoting folding and oligomerization and suppressing degradation. By differentially interacting with RUBV E1 and E2, calnexin and calreticulin control the transport of these two glycoproteins. Since these glycoproteins associate with calnexin and calreticulin over a prolonged duration (>60 min), the maturation of RUBV glycoproteins has been proposed to be the rate limiting step of the transport of glycoproteins from ER to Golgi complex, where virion formation by budding occurs [153]. In addition, a stem-and-loop structure at the 3\u2032 end of the RUBV genomic RNA was found to interact with the N-terminal domain of calreticulin [156]. While this interaction was hypothesized to (1) promote viral RNA translation and/or replication or (2) compartmentalizing the RNA to escape the surveillance by the host innate immune system, its biological significance remains in doubt [157].",

Two glycoproteins on the surface of the enveloped Sendai virus particle, the fusion protein (F) and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), mediate virus entry into host cells. Following their synthesis in infected cells, both proteins undergo maturation by interacting with different chaperones during their transport through ER and Golgi complex to the cell surface, the site of virus formation by budding [158]. F and HN have been reported to interact with ER chaperones with different kinetics. The F precursor protein, which is a type I integral membrane protein and can be cleaved in to two active subunits linked by disulfide-bonds, shows only transient interaction with calnexin (t\n1/2\n = 8 min). The HN protein, a type II integral membrane protein that functions as a tetramer, has slower kinetics by sequentially interacting with Bip, calnexin and calreticulin to ensure the correct folding and assembly [158].",

The accessory protein, Tax, of HTLV-1 is primarily located in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional transactivator. Nevertheless, the Tax protein can also be exported to the cytoplasm to interact with a number of host transcription factors including NF-\u03baB. This nuclear transport process possibly involves the interaction of Tax with calreticulin [160]. Interestingly, calreticulin-mediated nuclear transport is dependent on Ca2+\n[161]. It has been reported that Ca2+-loaded calreticulin does not support nuclear export of leucine-rich NES-containing proteins. However, calreticulin restores the nuclear export capability after treatment with EGTA. It still remains to be tested whether this property has effects on the subcellular distribution of Tax. In addition to Tax, the viral protein P12I, an ER/Golgi-residing protein encoded by the Px open reading frame of HTLV-1, has been shown to interact with both calreticulin and calnexin [162]. This interaction is thought to facilitate the folding of p12I and to modulate the level of Ca2+ storage. Another possible role of such interaction is to retain calreticulin-MHC-I complexes in the ER or cis-Golgi, thereby blocking its association with \u03b22-microglobulin and the trafficking of the protein complex to the cell surface [163].",

The HPV E6 has been found to possess oncogenic activity by stimulating immortalization of human keratinocytes and transforming established fibroblasts [164]. By targeting p53, Bak and Myc for degradation, E6 protein is capable of inhibiting apoptosis of infected cells. The HPV-16 E6 proteins also bind a hexa-EF-hand CaBP, ERC-55, that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum [165]. The interacting region in ERC-55 maps to a stretch of 25 amino acids in the fourth EF-hand motif that is capable of binding Ca2+ and folds into the typical helix-loop-helix conformation [166]. The exiting helix of the EF-hand motif, but not the Ca2+-binding loop and the entering helix, is fully responsible for this interaction.

            "text": "Fig. 1: The choreography of Ca2+ signaling and examples of virus-induced perturbations on Ca2+ homeostasis. Upon extracellular stimulation, the free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]CYT) rapidly increases by the entry of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane via Ca2+ channels, such as voltage-operated channels (VOC), receptor-operated channels (ROC), transient receptor potential ion-channel (TRP) and store-operated channels (SOC), or by the release of Ca2+ from internal stores (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex, and lysosomes) through inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) due to activation of membrane receptors (G protein coupled receptor [GPCR] and receptor tyrosine kinase [RTK]) and the subsequent synthesis of IP3. At the resting state, [Ca2+]CYT is maintained at submicromolar range by extruding Ca2+ outside of the plasma membrane via plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and Na2+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), or by pumping Ca2+ back into internal stores through sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) or secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA). In mitochondria, Ca2+ can easily pass through outer mitochondrial membrane pores and cross the inner mitochondrial membrane through the membrane-embedded Ca2+ uniporter. Ca2+ exits mitochondria through the opening of a non-selective high-conductance channel permeability transition pore (PTP) in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). The Ca2+ signals are delivered by affecting the activity of Ca2+ buffers (e.g., calreticulin), Ca2+ effectors (e.g., CaM and S100A10) and Ca2+-regulated enzymes. The signals can also have \u201clong-term\u201d effects by modulating the activity of transcriptional factors including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) or Ca2+-dependent transcriptional cotransactivators (e.g., p300). Viral proteins are capable of perturbing the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by (1) modulating Ca2+ pumps and/or channels on the plasma membrane (e.g., Tat and gp120 of HIV-1, HBx of HBV; blue boxes); (2) triggering Ca2+ release from internal stores via IP3R (e.g., NSP4 of rotavirus and Nef of HIV; purple boxes) or altering membrane permeability and pump activity of internal stores (e.g., 2B of coxsakievirus, p7 of HCV, and core protein of HCV; purple boxes,); (3) disrupting mitochondrial membrane permeabilization or potential (e.g., Vpr of HIV-1, p13II of HTLV-1, core protein of HCV and HBx of HBV; lemon boxes); (4) activating Ca2+-responsive transcriptional factors or coactivators, such as p300 (e.g., p12I of HTLV-1 and Vpr of HIV-1; yellow box) in the nucleus. Moreover, a variety of viral proteins interact with important cellular CaBPs, such as CaM, S100A10 and calreticulin, to remodel the Ca2+ signaling network. The gradient color bar on the left indicates free Ca2+ concentration in subcellular compartments. Calcium ions are shown as cyan dots.",

            "text": "Fig. 2: Virus infection selectively perturbs pro-apoptotic and pro-survival ER-mitochondria Ca2+ signaling. Upon engagement of receptors, the production of IP3 leads to the activation of IP3R and release of Ca2+ from internal store. The decrease of ER Ca2+ concentration is subsequently sensed by the EF-hand-containing ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1, which in turn activates the CRAC channels through its direct interaction with the pore-forming subunit Orai1, followed by a second phase of intracellular Ca2+ elevation (store-operated Ca2+ entry; high frequency cytosolic Ca2+ oscillation with low amplitude) and further activation of downstream effectors, including calcineurin, NFAT and NFAT-dependent gene expression (e.g., Bcl-2 and IL-2) [53], [171]. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (e.g., Bcl-2) inhibits Ca2+ release from ER and thus exerts anti-apoptotic effects to promote survival. NFAT can be activated by viral proteins (e.g., HIV-1 Nef [12], HTLV-1 p12I[13], [14], HCV core protein [15], [16], and HHV-8 K1 [17], HBV HBx [62], [63]; red ovals) to enhance virus replication or to establish persistent infection. It is of great interest to test whether viral proteins (red oval with question mark) can directly target SOC components (STIM1 and Orai1) to affect NFAT activation and ER Ca2+ store refilling. A decrease in [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi (for example, induced by viroporin, 2B of Coxsakievirus; red cylinder highlighted in yellow) may inhibit protein trafficking pathways and cause intracellular accumulation of ER or Golgi-derived secretory vesicles, at which viral RNA replication takes place [20], [21]. Ca2+ released from ER can be readily taken up by mitochondria at locations in close proximity to the ER extruding pores (so-called ER-mitochondria Ca2+ flux). Abnormal exodus of ER Ca2+ could result in Ca2+ overloading in mitochondria. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is mediated by the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) across outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the Ca2+ uniporter of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Ca2+ exits mitochondria through the opening of a non-selective high-conductance channel permeability transition pore (PTP) in IMM and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) [85], [86]. During virus infection, viral proteins may readily target mitochondria and exert either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic action by altering mitochondrial Ca2+ levels. A modest increase of ER-mitochondria Ca2+ flux may boost ATP production by activating Ca2+-dependent Kreb's cycle dehydrogenases, thereby meeting higher energy demand due to active viral replication (e.g., HCV [18] and CMV [19]). However, Ca2+ overloading in mitochondria exerts pro-apoptotic effects. It activates the opening of PTP, causes release of cytochrome c (purple stars) and activation of caspase 9, and eventually commits cells to apoptosis [87]. Virus infection may generate either extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic stimulus. For example, HIV-1 Tat-induced overexpression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and HCV core and NS5A-induced elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may exacerbate mitochondrial Ca2+ overloading and cause apoptosis in infected cells. Intracellularly, abnormal increase of mitochondria Ca2+ uptake (e.g., HCV core protein [29], [30]; red oval) and disruption of IMM permeability (e.g., HIV-1 Vpr [90], HTLV-1 p13II[92] and HBV HBx [31]; red ovals or cylinder) may also lead to apoptotic cell death. Viral proteins induce apoptosis to facilitate virion release and maximize virus dissemination at a later stage of viral life cycle. In contrast, actions that downregulate ER-mitochondria Ca2+ flux (e.g., pore-formation on ER by Coxsakievirus 2B [21], [24]) or recruit pro-apoptotic protein (e.g., Bax) within mitochondria (e.g., CMV vMIA [26], [27]), may protect host cells from apoptosis and promote cellular survival signaling [23]. In general, an anti-apoptotic strategy is employed by virus to aid virus replication and effective immune evasion in early or middle stages of infection.

VP1, VP2 and VP3 are exposed to the external surface of the viral particle, whereas VP4 lies in the internal surface. A Ca2+ ion is found situated on the 5-fold axis of the capsid and coordinated by 5 oxygen atoms from the main chain carbonyl group of the 5-fold symmetry-related S1141 on VP1 (enlarged area). With two additional oxygen atoms from water molecules above or below the metal ion as coordinating ligands, the Ca2+-binding pocket forms a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.

The VP2 proteins of FPV and CPV bind three and two Ca2+ ions, respectively, at pH 7.5 [117] (Fig. 2C). Both FPV and CPV contain pH-dependent dual Ca2+-binding sites (sites 2 and 3; spheres with mixed green and magenta colors), in which the metal ions are separated by 4.6 \u00c5. The most striking structural difference between VP2 of these two viruses is within a flexible surface loop located within residues 359\u2013375. This loop forms a third Ca2+-binding site in FPV (site 1; green sphere), but not in CPV since D375 is replaced by N375 in CPV. This unique Ca2+-binding site in FPV VP2 is coordinated by oxygen atoms from the side chain of residues D373 and D375, as well as the main chain carbonyl groups of residues R361 and G362. The binding of Ca2+ to this particular site is speculated to cause conformational changes in VP2 and may influence the host range of these two related, but different, parvoviruses.
