Also, studies with uncomplicated entry criteria are usually more attractive to investigators; those with complex eligibility criteria make recruitment more difficult, are more difficult to explain to participants, and, ultimately, their findings may have limited generalisability. Further, the enthusiasm of investigators may wane if trial protocols require substantial efforts on their part.",

Studies should permit changes to best clinical care during the course of study follow\u2010up. This will maintain both the ethical integrity of the study and investigator interest, and protect participants while retaining scientific efficiency. For example, in a study examining the effects of a fibrate to prevent vascular disease in diabetes, a new indication for statin treatment, based on existing trial evidence, may emerge for some participants during follow\u2010up. In this instance, it would be preferable to allow those participants to use statins while continuing their study medication, rather than requiring them to withdraw from the study or stop taking study medication, potentially increasing the risk of participants being lost to follow\u2010up because statin therapy is prohibited in the study protocol. This strategy also helps maintain the relevance of the study question.",

For example, in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, the eligible range of liver function tests were initially based on hospital normal ranges,\n10\n and then revised to reflect the wider range seen in the community (Professor Ian Ford, Director, Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, UK, personal communication). However, if recruitment procedures are over\u2010 simplified, patients not likely to be compliant with the study treatment, or who may not have the disease under investigation, may be recruited. For example, recruiting patients presenting with fever and acute respiratory symptoms into a study of treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in which some may turn out to have negative tests for coronavirus, would result in a study with reduced efficiency (statistical power).\n2\n In this example, a brief run\u2010in period or delayed randomisation may provide an opportunity for patients still uncertain about a commitment to participate, or those who don't actually have SARS, to be identified and not randomly allocated to a study group.",

Because of this, each proposed data item to be collected should be carefully justified for inclusion in the trial protocol.",

However, all centres need to have a patient pool of adequate size, and the infrastructure and resources to recruit and manage the projected number of patients efficiently. Centres interested in participating in the study should identify through their screening logs (or equivalents) their potential participant numbers. However, only a proportion of these would eventually be recruited into the study. Research clinics should ideally be geographically accessible to the targeted patient group, and reimbursement of patient's expenses, as well as their transport and parking arrangements, should be considered. Payments to participating clinics for study costs are usually on a pro\u2010rata basis, with funds matched to the number of participants recruited at each location.",

Employing an experienced and dedicated research coordinator at each participating trial centre is a key to successful recruitment, and reduces the time demanded of investigators. In the Long\u2010term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) study,\n11\n experience during the recruitment phase suggested that staff became better at identifying patients who would be poor long\u2010term compliers, and were able to exclude more of such patients in the later stages of recruitment. Centres should plan to recruit steadily over the recruitment period to ensure an even workload during study follow\u2010up.",

Sites with previous clinical research experience can help newer sites to be successful. Central monitoring of recruitment and feedback to participating centres on the trial's progress, by means of email, newsletters, or meetings, will foster continued interest and participation, and will enable the effectiveness of different recruitment methods to be evaluated. Further, adequate resources and incentives for trial staff and potential participants are key requirements for success.
