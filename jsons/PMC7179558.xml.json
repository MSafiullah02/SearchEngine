Indeed, there are few studies concerned with the molecular mechanisms governing HCoV-OC43 infection and its effect on the intracellular host defenses. HCoV-OC43 is over 30 kb in length, and similarly to the other coronaviruses, it is composed of the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [7]. Uniquely, there are two accessory proteins interspaced between these structural proteins called ns2a and ns5a [8]. These proteins are not essential for replication; however, they might play a role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection [9].",

            "text": "The interferon (IFN) induction and signaling pathway is the major branch in the innate immune response against viruses. The induction of type I IFN is initiated by molecular sensing of viral RNA by pattern recognition receptors such as TLR, RIG-I, and MDA5 [10]. The adaptor protein MAVS mediates the signals from RIG-I and MDA5 to activate the kinases TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, which in turn phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors [11]. IRF3 and IRF7 dimerize to undergo nuclear translocation and initiate the transcription of type I IFN. The adaptor proteins MYD88 and TRIF mediate signals from TLRs and activate IRAK1, TRAF6, and the aforementioned kinases [12]. The IRFs along with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) can then be phosphorylated to translocate into the nucleus and establish the transcription of type I IFN by binding cognate sites on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [12]. NF-\u03baB specifically binds to the NF-\u03baB response element (NF-\u03baB-RE) to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory and cell survival genes [13].",

These kinases in turn phosphorylate the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 [14, 15]. Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 then dimerize and undergo nuclear translocation, where they form a complex with IRF9 called the ISGF3.

Following 24 h of incubation, the cells were stimulated for 6 or 24 h with IFN-\u03b1 (PBL Assay ScienceTM, Piscataway, NJ, USA) at 5 \u00d7 104 units/well, Sendai virus (SeV) (ATCC VR-105) at multiple of infection 1, or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Life TechnologiesTM) at 0.1 \u03bcg/mL. Thereafter, promoter activity was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase\u00ae Reporter Assay System (PromegaTM) and the GloMax\u00ae-Multi Jr luminometer (PromegaTM) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase levels were determined in relative light units and normalized against Renilla luciferase levels.",

The PCR array monitored the transcriptional activity of different genes involved in the activation of antiviral and pro-inflammatory proteins following amplification of RNA transcripts by real-time RT-PCR. However, we only profiled the expression of genes relevant to the antiviral response elements. Cycle threshold (CT) values were exported to an Excel file to create a table of CT values. This table was then uploaded on to the Qiagen data analysis web portal (http://www.qiagen.com/geneglobe). CT values were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Following SeV challenge of HEK-293 cells, the expression of genes involved in the type I IFN and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways was downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 structural or accessory proteins (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in the presence of the influenza A NS1 protein.

The expression of IRF7 gene was more downregulated in the presence of ns2a or N protein than in the presence of other HCoV-OC43 proteins (p < 0.001), whereas the expression of TLR7 gene was more downregulated in the presence of ns5a protein than in the presence of other HCoV-OC43 proteins (p < 0.01).

Our data showed that the transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03b2 promoter, and NF-\u03baB-RE was inhibited in the presence of HCoV-OC43 M protein. In addition, like the accessory proteins, the HCoV-OC43 M protein was able to downregulate the expression of IFNA1, IRF7, TLR7, MYD88, TRADD, and MAVS.

            "text": "The coronavirus N protein binds genomic RNA to form the helical capsid, and has a critical role in coronavirus replication [30, 31]. The SARS-CoV N protein can activate NF-\u03baB-RE in Vero E6 cells [32]. However, SARS-CoV N protein inhibits the promoter activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03b2 promoter, and NF-\u03baB-RE in 293T cells [17]. Our study showed that the transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03b2 promoter, and NF-\u03baB-RE was inhibited in the presence of HCoV-OC43 N protein. Lai et al. [33] showed that after 24 h of TNF-\u03b1 treatment, HCoV-OC43 N protein potentiates NF-\u03baB expression in 293T cells by binding its inhibitor, miRNA 9. miRNA 9 expression is induced by stimuli which activate NF-\u03baB, such as TNF-\u03b1 and lipopolysaccharide [34]. Unfortunately, the authors did not show results for NF-\u03baB-RE activation after 6 h of TNF-\u03b1 treatment, the optimal time for NF-\u03baB-RE activation in our experiments. The influenza A virus that is known to inhibit IRF3, AP-1, and NF-\u03baB activation [35, 36] was shown to upregulate the miRNA 9 expression [37]. We speculate that the expression of N protein results in transient downregulation of NF-\u03baB expression through downregulation of its mediators (e.g., TLR7, MYD88, TRADD), leading to early inhibition of NF-KB-RE activation, and that the accumulation of miRNA9 in cells with time will lead to the formation of N protein/miRNA 9 complex and the removal of inhibition on NF-KB and NF-KB-RE.",
