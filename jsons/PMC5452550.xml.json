Within this context, one or more of the following are required to meet the diagnosis of PTSD: (a) direct exposure to trauma; (b) witnessing the traumatic act or event in person; (c) indirect involvement, by learning that a close relative or close friend was exposed to trauma; (d) if the event involved actual or threatened death, it must have been violent or accidental; and (e) repeated or extreme indirect exposure to aversive details of the event(s) has occurred, usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, collecting body parts, social workers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse).[5] This does not include indirect nonprofessional exposure to above-mentioned events through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures. In this Editorial, we will discuss the very real and well-documented phenomenon of PTSD among EVD survivors, caretakers, and their immediate contacts.",

Many of the caregivers who tended to those affected by EVD were from the local workforce and had to treat acquaintances and neighbors. Witnessing the loss of those within one's immediate circle of social contacts may result in significant psychological trauma.[12] Even more stressful and impactful may be the loss of a colleague/team member, making palpable the dangers of the work involved and the very real risk of one's own mortality. Situational demands often force the participants to \u201ccarry on and defer\u201d the grieving process until later, especially during massive and difficult-to-control events that occurred during the Ebola outbreak. Hundreds of front-line health-care workers contracted EVD, with approximately half of them ultimately dying.[13] Of note, both grieving caretakers and families were forced to deal with the loss of life while processing their own survival in the setting of significantly decreased social support.",

In the context of PTSD, opinions vary on how culture plays a role as a modulating factor.[27] Specific views range from PTSD being a culture-specific condition created by the Western world[28] to the more broadly accepted idea that PTSD is a clearly defined mental health disorder which, nevertheless, cannot be decontextualized from cultural influences.[29]",
