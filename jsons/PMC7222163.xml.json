All the cases had seizures and altered sensorium at admission with GCS ranging from 4 to 12. They had generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Clinical signs of raised ICP (tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, unequal pupils, hypertonia, brisk deep tendon reflexes, pupillary inequality, or abnormal respiration) were noted in 4 cases.

[5] reported 14 children with acute childhood encephalitis and encephalopathy associated with seasonal influenza and noted that 64% had neurological manifestations within 5 d of onset of respiratory symptoms and >50% had neurological sequelae. Kedia et al. [9], in a retrospective study demonstrated that neurological complications were noted in 7.5% (23/307) cases during 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 65% (15/23) needed intensive care, 50% (3/6) had elevated CSF proteins but no significant pleocytosis, 83.3% (5/6) had abnormal MRI brain, 13% died, and 22% had short-term disability. Goenka et al. [8] reported 25 cases (21 children and 4 adults) of H1N1 with neurological manifestations, 80% (n = 20) needed intensive care, 16% (n = 4) died, and 68% (n = 17) had poor outcome. Similarly, Khandaker et al. [16] and Wilking et al. [17] also demonstrated that 8.8% - 9.7% children with H1N1 developed neurological manifestations, 1/3rd to 2/3rd cases required ICU admission, and 25% - 50% needed mechanical ventilation. Other studies also reported poor neurological outcome and sequelae [4, 7, 8].",
