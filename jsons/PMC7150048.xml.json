            "text": "In the early 1990s, several research groups discovered, independently, that the direct inoculation of a DNA plasmid coding for a specific protein antigen could elicit an immune response against that antigen (Tang et al., 1992; Robinson et al., 1993; Ulmer et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1993; Lu et al., 1995). DNA or nucleic acid vaccination is now considered to be the fourth generation of vaccines after live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and recombinant protein-based vaccines. This new vaccine technology could not have come at a more important time in history given the increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for bioterrorism purposes. The need for immunological protection for large populations would require the production or stockpiling of large quantities of vaccines. Future vaccines need to be effective while maintaining a high safety profile. The designs of vaccines have to be flexible to counter antigen alterations and to protect people from more than one type of pathogen. DNA vaccines are an ideal vaccine system to employ in the face of such challenges.",

It is this expression system that serves as a delivery system to produce either secreted or cell-associated antigens with the goal of eliciting optimized antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the host. Over the past 15 years, DNA vaccine technology has gone through significant improvements. The focus of research has gradually shifted from proof-of-concept studies in animal models to the demonstration of immunogenicity in humans. DNA vaccine technology provided researchers with a unique platform that is effective in achieving three important objectives in the development of the next generation of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and pathogens that have the potential to be used as bioterrorism agents. First, DNA vaccines are a simple alternative option against those pathogens to which there were effective vaccines in the past but the original manufacturing process is no longer considered safe. Second, DNA vaccines are able to elicit improved cell-mediated immune responses in addition to protective antibody responses, which dominate the design of previous generations of vaccines. Finally, DNA vaccines are an ideal tool to screen for new or optimal protective antigens (PA) to formulate new or improved vaccines against emerging and neglected infectious diseases or bioterrorism.",

            "text": "The critical step for DNA vaccination is to establish a high level of gene expression in a mammalian host. One way to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is to alter the nucleic acid sequences of the viral DNA so that they better complement the genetic makeup of the mammalian host while keeping the same amino acid\u2014a process called codon optimization. The basis for using codon optimization in DNA vaccine design stems from the idea that many amino acids can be coded by more than one codon and that the frequency by which a mammalian host may use a particular codon may differ from usage by a virus. Various studies have used this knowledge in order to improve the ability of mammalian cells to express viral proteins (Haas et al., 1996; Andre et al., 1998; Kotsopoulou et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2004; Apt et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006a, Wang et al., 2006c). It is this method of altering the genetic sequence that has proven to be effective in increasing the immunogenicity of various DNA vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Haas et al., 1996; Andre et al., 1998; Kotsopoulou et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006a), influenza virus (Wang et al., 2006c), and dengue virus (Apt et al., 2006) due to increased overall antigen production as a result of enhanced mRNA stability (Wang et al., 2006a) and better utilization of host-cell tRNAs (Haas et al., 1996). Due to the adaptation of codon optimization, an otherwise low efficient DNA expression vector can achieve high-level antigen expression (Wang et al., 2006a).",

The full-length gene sequences of some candidate antigens cannot be directly used as the antigen gene inserts of the DNA vaccine and may require modification in order to achieve a high-level expression of functional antigenic proteins. For example, an HIV DNA vaccine is not efficient in expressing the full-length glycoenvelope protein (Env) of HIV-1, a gp160 kDa protein; however, two truncated versions of Env, the gp120 and gp140 proteins, that only express the extracellular portion of Env are capable of producing large amounts of Env antigens and eliciting high Env-specific antibody responses (Lu et al., 1998). Sometimes a signal peptide sequence different from the natural leader sequence may also improve antigen expression and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines (Wang et al., 2006a). This process of modifying the original antigen coding sequence is called \u201cantigen engineering\u201d (Lu et al., 1999).",

The delivery methodology for DNA vaccines started with the intramuscular injection of so-called \u201cnaked DNA\u201d into the host allowing for the uncoated DNA to be taken up into the cells, transcribed, the antigen produced and finally, an immune response elicited. Further development of DNA vaccine technology include facilitated DNA vaccines that employ the use of carriers made of various chemical materials (e.g., lipid polymers and cationic poly(lactide-coglycolide) [PLG] microparticles) (Felgner and Ringold 1989; Wheeler et al., 1996; Stopeck et al., 1998; Herrmann et al., 1999; Klavinskis et al., 1999; O'Hagan et al., 2001; Otten et al., 2005). DNA vaccines, naked or formulated with the above carriers, can be delivered intradermally, intramuscularly, and subcutaneously by a conventional needle injection. Mucosal delivery of DNA vaccines has also been tested including intranasal route; however, in some studies, an emulsion-mediated technique was required in order to induce immunity (Kim et al., 2006).",

On the other hand, the physical delivery approach using particle mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) device has proven to be effective in eliciting immune responses in humans against hepatitis B virus (Tacket et al., 1999; Roy et al., 2000; Rottinghaus et al., 2003), influenza (Drape et al., 2006), and malaria (McConkey et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Since the most successful DNA vaccine inoculation method (PMED) for eliciting immune responses in nonhuman primates and in humans is not commercially available for clinical use, it has become important to utilize other techniques and methods to increase the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines that are currently in development. One such method is the prime-boost approach. The rationale underlying this strategy is that gene-based vaccines, presented by a recombinant viral vector or as DNA plasmids, elicit immune responses by producing antigens in vivo; however, these immune responses have not been strong, particularly in humans. In order to increase the levels of immune responses, in particular the cell-mediated immune responses, strategies have been developed to prime the immune system with the DNA vaccine and boost with a recombinant viral vector (Pancholi et al., 2000; Ramshaw and Ramsay, 2000; McShane et al., 2001; Schneider et al., 2001; Gonzalo et al., 2002; Mellquist-Riemenschneider et al., 2003; Woodland, 2004; Seaman et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2005; Perkins et al., 2006), or an attenuated virus (Yuan et al., 2005). This DNA\u2013viral vector combination has proven effective in eliciting high-level cell-mediated immune responses in nonhuman primate studies (Letvin et al., 2004; Boyer et al., 2005) and even in humans (Mwau et al., 2004; Vuola et al., 2005; Goonetilleke et al., 2006; Hanke et al., 2007).",

The development of an effective AIDS vaccine has been proven more challenging than initially anticipated. There does not appear to be natural adaptive immune protection against HIV-1 infection; hence, the correlate of protection to be induced by a vaccine is uncertain. As a retrovirus, HIV-1 integrates into the genome of host dividing cells, which in turn becomes the source of continuing infection. Its proteins go through constant mutations due to the lack of proofreading function of retroviral polymerases. The structure of envelope glycoprotein (Env), the immunodominant antigen of HIV-1, is very complicated and highly variable to escape from antibody responses.",

While the live attenuated vaccination approach was successful in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) studies in nonhuman primates (Desrosiers et al., 1989; Daniel et al., 1990), due to safety concerns this approach has little hope of being tested in humans. HIV was among the first pathogens for which the DNA vaccine approach was explored (Wang et al., 1993; Lu et al., 1995) and the HIV vaccine field quickly became the major testing ground for the optimization and application of DNA vaccines. DNA vaccines have been used to express many key HIV-1 antigens including Env, Gag, Pol, Nef, Rev, and Tat for the induction of both antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses. Currently, DNA vaccines are one of the key components in almost every major HIV vaccine development program. DNA vaccines are used mainly as priming immunizations and are typically combined with either a viral vector boost (Mwau et al., 2004; Graham et al., 2006; Tavel et al., 2007) or a protein boost (Wang et al., 2008a). More human studies have been planned or are ongoing. The results from these studies will provide important guidance for the future development of DNA vaccines for other emerging infectious disease and biodefense applications.",

Influenza A viruses infects both humans and other animal species, including swine, horses, and avian. The predominant human influenza virus vaccine is the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), which incorporates the predominant viruses that are predicted to circulate during the next influenza season. The vaccine typically includes an H1 subtype and an H3 subtype from influenza A plus an influenza B virus. The immunogenicity of these vaccines is relatively low and requires annual booster immunizations to maintain the levels of protective immune responses and to develop new protective antibodies against mutated viral antigens that occasionally emerge. A newly developed cold-adapted live influenza virus vaccine has much improved immunogenicity but it cannot be used for young children and older populations due to a lack of safety data in these groups. This restriction greatly reduces the utility of this new vaccine because young children and older people are particularly vulnerable to influenza infection.",

Studies demonstrated the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines using either nucleocapsid (NP) or hemagglutinin (HA) antigens (Ulmer et al., 1993; Robinson et al., 1993; Fynan et al., 1993). A landmark study in the early 1990s showed that a DNA vaccine expressing NP was effective in eliciting NP-specific CTL and protection in mice from a subsequent challenge with a heterologous strain of influenza A virus, as measured by decreased viral lung titers, inhibition of mass loss, and increased survival (Ulmer et al., 1993). Subsequent studies from this and other groups confirmed the protective immune responses induced by NP DNA vaccines (Ulmer et al., 1998; Cox et al., 2002) or by the combination of DNA prime-adenoviral vector boost vaccines (Epstein et al., 2005), but there were also reports showing that NP DNA vaccine alone was not effective in protecting pigs against challenges with homologous virus (Macklin et al., 1998). However, later studies in ferrets and non-human primates demonstrated the efficacy of a DNA vaccine encoding three proteins, NP, HA, and M1 antigens (Donnelly et al., 1995, Donnelly et al., 1997). DNA vaccine expressing other influenza viral antigens have also been reported including the co-expression of both M1 and M2 antigens (Okuda et al., 2001), the co-delivery of NP and M2 DNA vaccines plus a low dose of HA-\u00adexpressing DNA vaccines (Jimenez et al., 2007), and the use of NA-expressing DNA vaccines (Chen et al., 1998, Chen et al., 2001). Various levels of protection with these influenza DNA vaccines were achieved in mouse models. Protection against influenza B virus infection was also achieved with DNA vaccines expressing HA or NA antigens but not with NB or NP DNA vaccines (Chen et al., 2001).",

However, recent studies suggested that the HA antigens from H1 and H3 serotypes of influenza A viruses require different antigen designs for the induction of optimal protective antibody responses (Wang et al., 2006c). This may further affect the selection of HA antigens from avian influenza viruses. Until now, HA DNA vaccines have successfully elicited antibody responses and protection against several avian influenza viruses including H5N1 (Kodihalli et al., 1999), H5N2 (Kodihalli et al., 1997; Jiang et al., 2007), and H9N2 (Qiu et al., 2006). The H5 HA DNA vaccine has been shown to induce immune protection against not only a homologous, lethal H5 virus but also two antigenic variants in chickens (Kodihalli et al., 1997). The level of protection may vary in different animal models. Despite the success of inducing protective immunity against heterologous viral challenge in chickens, an HA DNA vaccine encoding for heterologous viruses did not prevent infection in mice. However, this HA DNA vaccine did prevent death associated with infection (Kodihalli et al., 1999).",

Using a particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) device, 3 groups of 12 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of 1, 2, or 4 \u03bcg of an HA DNA vaccine. The PMED influenza DNA vaccine elicited serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses at all three dose levels with the highest and most consistent responses in subjects vaccinated with the highest dose. On day 56, sera HA-specific antibody responses in both 2 and 4 \u03bcg groups reached the levels required for influenza vaccine approval established by the Committee for Proprietary Medical Products (CPMP) in the European Union (Drape et al., 2006). This result was important because it demonstrated that a DNA vaccine was capable of eliciting protective immune response levels. One notable factor in this study was the use of the \u201cgene gun\u201d delivery method, which has proven to be more effective than needle injection of DNA vaccines in inducing immune responses in humans. The availability of the gene gun or other epidermal delivery methods will be important in the successful development of DNA vaccines for biodefense and emerging and neglected diseases.\n",

Studies have shown that vaccinia virus IMV-specific antigens, A27, L1, and D8, and EEV-specific antigens, A33 and B5, are immunogenic and protective, albeit variably, against VACV infection in animal models (Galmiche et al., 1999; Hooper et al., 2000, Hooper et al., 2004; Fogg et al., 2004; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006, Sakhatskyy et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2007). These antigens induced high-titer serum antibodies and/or neutralizing antibodies against the vaccinia virus (Galmiche et al., 1999; Hooper et al., 2000, Hooper et al., 2003, Hooper et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2007; Heraud et al., 2006; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006, Sakhatskyy et al., 2008). A four-gene combination DNA vaccine that encodes two IMV (A27 and L1) and two EEV (A33 and B5) antigens was protective against VACV challenge in mice and against monkeypox virus challenge in nonhuman primates (Hooper et al., 2003). In a separate study, IMV antigen D8 was shown to be a highly immunogenic antigen that induced high-level protection, alone or in combination with the other pox antigens (Sakhatskyy et al., 2006, Sakhatskyy et al., 2008). However, these pox DNA vaccines, as well as the recombinant protein-based pox subunit vaccines, were not as protective as the live-attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine unless polyvalent formulations and/or multiple immunizations are used (Hooper et al., 2000, Hooper et al., 2003; Fogg et al., 2004; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006, Sakhatskyy et al., 2008).",

In a DNA prime-protein boost study, rhesus macaques were immunized with a four-antigen formulation (L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R) in the form of either DNA vaccines alone, Escherichia coli produced recombinant protein vaccines alone, or a combination of both vaccines.

It can permit the direct cloning and expression of antigen from variola major (Sakhatskyy et al., 2008; Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2007) since the protective antigen genes can be chemically synthesized, even codon optimized, without directly working with the highly pathogenic variola major viruses, which are no longer available for research applications. In summary, DNA vaccination is particularly useful for the next generation of smallpox vaccines based on subunit antigens. It can deliver multiple protective antigens in one mixed formulation, elicit both antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses, and optimize the antigen sequences and designs for the protective antigens. Optimized genes can also be used to produce recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines.",

No matter whether the entire S protein or fragments of the S protein are incorporated into the DNA vector for immunization, significant levels of S-specific immune responses were elicited including high-titer binding antibody (Yang et al., 2004; Kong et al., 2005; Zakhartchouk et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005b) or neutralizing antibody responses(Yang et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005; Zakhartchouk et al.,2005; Wang et al., 2005b).

Marburg virus was identified in 1967 and named after the site where the infection occurred, Marburg, Germany. There is no effective prophylaxis or treatment for infection with either virus. While filoviruses are uncommon causes of human infection, the development of filovirus vaccines are warranted based on their remarkable lethality with mortality rates ranging from 23% (Marburg) to 90% (Ebola).

These vaccine strategies have targeted various viral proteins including both the secreted (sGP) and transmembrane (GP) forms of the glycoprotein and the nucleoprotein (NP). These DNA vaccines were tested in various animal models including mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates, and in humans with promising immunogenicity results. In an early study, all three viral proteins were tested to determine their immunogenicity in mice and their protective efficacy in guinea pigs (Xu et al., 1998). Three 50 \u03bcg injections of the NP and sGP DNA plasmids were effective, although to varying levels, in eliciting an antibody response while the GP DNA did not elicit a neutralizing response. However, the NP construct induced only minimal CTL responses, whereas the sGP and GP plasmids induced strong CTL responses. Furthermore, guinea pigs challenged approximately 2 months after the first immunization showed nearly complete protection: GP (6/6), sGP (5/6), and NP (4/4). Similar results were observed in mouse protection studies with the GP protein although as many as four immunizations were required (Vanderzanden et al., 1998; Riemenschneider et al., 2003). Likewise a GP DNA prime-recombinant baculovirus-derived GP protein boost regimen afforded guinea pigs good protection. A separate study showed that DNA immunization and subsequent boost with adenovirus vectors that encoded either GP, NP, or a combination of the two conferred 100% protection in guinea pigs (Sullivan et al., 2000). Furthermore, antibody titers were increased in mice that received the GP DNA prime plus adenovirus vector boost when compared to DNA alone. Since the Ebola virus has to be modified in order to produce disease in rodents, primate models of infection would more closely emulate infection in humans. After three injections of naked GP DNA vaccines, several months of rest, and recombinant adenovirus based vaccine boost, antibody titers were increased 10- to 20-fold when compared to DNA immunization alone and there was 9- to 20-fold increase in cellular immune responses that appear to be driven by CD4+ T cells. This vaccination regimen was able to confer protection in four out of four monkeys and sterilizing immunity was observed in three out of four.",

This outbreak continued in the subsequent years in the United States in humans and in horses. No human or veterinary vaccines existed for WNV at the time of the initial outbreak. Different versions of DNA vaccines were developed and they all showed good immunogenicity. One version expresses the WNV capsid protein, and in vivo study in mice showed Th1 type immune responses in immunized animals (Yang et al., 2001). Another used a novel approach to express a full-length infectious Kunjin virus RNA. Kunjin virus is a genetically stable Australian flavivirus originally shown to be genetically and antigenically very closely related to several WNV strains, which later was reclassified as a WNV (Heinz et al., 2000). Sequence analysis revealed 98\u201399% amino acid homology between Kunjin and NY99, the WNV causing the initial 1999 New York outbreak. By using a further modified molecular clone with mutated NS1 gene, an attenuated Kunjin strain was produced and used as a vaccine. The use of DNA vaccine directing in vivo transcription of the full-length attenuated but infectious KUN viral RNA in mice led to full protection against the WNV NY strain (Hall et al., 2003).",

Repeated immunizations increase the cost of vaccination campaigns in the developing countries. Some of these inactivated vaccines are not licensed in the United States.

Three viral proteins have been reported to provide protective immunity: prM, E, and NS1. DNA vaccines encoding for these viral proteins have been successful in inducing antibodies and protection against JE in mouse models. In one report an NS1 DNA vaccine was shown to afford greater protection from JE challenge and to induce a higher level of antibodies compared to a DNA vaccine encoding the E and prM proteins (Lin et al., 1998). Another study found that a construct encoding prM and E produced neutralizing antibodies and protected mice against JE challenge while constructs encoding capsid (C) or non-structural proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, or NS5 induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses but afforded only partial protection against JE challenge (Konishi et al., 2003a). These results were interpreted to indicate the relative importance of antibody vis-\u00e0-vis T cells in vaccine-induced protection. Other investigators reported that a DNA vaccine encoding both the E and prM proteins was as effective or elicited better responses when compared to the commercially available JE vaccine, JEVAX (Chang et al., 2000). Additional studies have shown that needle-free injector administration of DNA vaccines encoding E and prM proteins elicited increased neutralizing antibodies earlier when compared to intramuscular administration in monkey (Tanabayashi et al., 2003) and mouse (Konishi et al., 2006, Konishi et al., 2003c).",

            "text": "Currently, there is no approved vaccine against dengue viruses (DEN). These viruses, spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, are endemic throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. There are approximately 100 million infections per year, resulting in both dengue fever and the more serious, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Although various vaccine approaches including live attenuated, inactivated whole virion and recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines have been tested, the presence of four serotypes of DEN and complicated immunopathologic mechanisms involved in DHF have greatly reduced the speed of developing an effective DEN vaccine. Several DNA vaccine formulations have been developed against all four serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4), and in some cases, a tetravalent formulation has induced memory immune responses against both homologous and heterologous viral challenges (Konishi et al., 2006). Typically, the DNA vaccines that most effectively elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses contain the DEN premembrane/membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes. Immunization with plasmids encoding these genes have been shown to engender antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody responses and protection against DEN-1 in mice (Raviprakash et al., 2000a; Konishi et al., 2003b, Konishi et al., 2003c) and nonhuman primates (Kochel et al., 2000; Raviprakash et al., 2000b) and against DEN-2 in mice (Konishi et al., 2000, Konishi et al., 2003b, Konishi et al., 2003c; Putnak et al., 2003) and nonhuman primates (Putnak et al., 2003). Additional studies have examined the ability of a tetravalent DNA vaccine formulation, encoding the prM and E genes of all four dengue serotypes, to induce immune responses and found that antibodies specific for each serotype could be induced following immunization (Mota et al., 2005; Apt et al., 2006; Konishi et al., 2006; Raviprakash et al., 2006). Furthermore, immunization with such a tetravalent DNA vaccine was able to elicit neutralizing antibody responses 4 days following the viral challenge against both the homologous virus used for the challenge assay and against the heterologous viruses (i.e., not used for challenge) (Konishi et al., 2006).",

In one study, a DNA vaccine encoding for the NS1 failed to induce antigen-specific antibodies after one to three immunizations; however, greater responses were observed following challenge with DEN-2 in vaccinated mice when compared to the unvaccinated group (Wu et al., 2003b). In contrast, mice vaccinated with a DNA vaccine based on the NS1 protein from DEN-2 displayed high levels of antibodies (Costa et al., 2006). While it appears as though these two DNA vaccines encoded the same antigen from the DEN-2 virus, slight differences in immunization schedule and/or dosing may have led to the different results. Despite the fact that antibodies were not detected after one to three immunizations with the NS-1 from DEN-2 (Wu et al., 2003b), the NS-1 DNA vaccine conferred protection against lethal challenge in both studies. Furthermore, newborn mice born to dams that were either infected with the DEN-2 virus (100% of litters) or immunized with the NS-1 DNA vaccine (75% of litters) were also protected against the dengue virus following challenge (Wu et al., 2003b).",

The clinical findings of these infections range from mild flu-like symptoms to encephalitis, coma, and death. While equine vaccines against some of these viruses have been developed, no human vaccines are currently available. DNA vaccine technology has been used to develop vaccines against VEE and WEE, which is of particular importance as these viruses have the potential to be used as biological warfare agents. In a first study, DNA immunization with a plasmid encoding the major structural proteins of WEE (capsid, E3, E2, 6K, and E1) afforded protection to 50\u2013100% of mice challenged with a lethal dose of one of three strains of WEE. Furthermore, immunized mice showed a strong T-cell proliferation response to purified E2 protein and a partial response to E1 when compared to controls (Nagata et al., 2005). A DNA vaccine has also been developed against VEE. In this study, a replication-defective adenovirus (Ad5) was used to boost the immune responses following the delivery of the DNA vaccine that expressed a region encoding for the E3, E2, and 6K structural proteins (Perkins et al., 2006). Following DNA immunization, no difference was observed in VEE virus-specific IgG response; however, following one intranasal boost with a homologous Ad-based vaccine a significant increase in VEE virus-specific IgG was observed. The prime-boost strategy also significantly enhanced protection against aerosol VEE challenge.",

Both inactivated and live-attenuated human rabies vaccines exist but each has its own limitations. DNA vaccination has proven successful against rabies infection in various animal models. In a first series of studies, mice immunized with the rabies glycoprotein displayed rabies virus glycoprotein-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, in addition to complete protection against viral challenge (Xiang et al., 1994, Xiang et al., 1995). Subsequent studies showed that a DNA vaccine encoding for a rabies glycoprotein induced a 176-fold increase in geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers following a boost 190 days after the primary immunization in nonhuman primates (Lodmell et al., 1998a, Lodmell et al., 1998b). Additional studies by this group showed that gene gun administration afforded mice protection against rabies virus challenge and that protective levels of antibodies persisted for over 300 days (Lodmell et al., 1998a, Lodmell et al., 1998b). They also showed that different prime-boost regimens elicited varying levels of neutralizing antibody responses: priming with a DNA vaccine, a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine (RVV), or the commercially available inactivated rabies vaccine followed by boosting with either the DNA or inactivated vaccines resulted in rapid and long-lasting antibody responses (Lodmell and Ewalt, 2000). This group also demonstrated that DNA vaccination could be used as an effective post-exposure vaccine (Lodmell and Ewalt, 2001; Lodmell et al., 2002).",

Infection with these viruses presents as a wide range of symptoms including fever and flu-like symptoms, meningitis, encephalitis and severe, fatal hemorrhagic fever. Few studies have been conducted in the development of DNA vaccines against these viral agents. In one study, a single immunization with a DNA plasmid encoding the full-length Lassa nucleoprotein was able to induce CD8+ T cell responses in mice and afforded protection against two arenaviruses, LCMV and the Pichinde virus (Rodriguez-Carreno et al., 2005). Unfortunately, DNA immunization against LCMV in another study did not show favorable results following intracranial viral challenge. Not only were some vaccinated mice not afforded protection against viral challenge but they also displayed greater immunopathology instead as evidenced by clinical symptoms of encephalitis and eventual death (Zarozinski et al., 1995). This study represented a rare example of where a DNA vaccine may worsen the outcome of viral infection. Although it is believed that such unexpected results are part of the unique immunopathogenesis of LCMV infection, careful selection of PAs may also be important for the development of DNA vaccines.",

It attracted great attention in the United States following intentional release of the agent in 2001. Although a licensed vaccine against anthrax has been developed (Bioport Corporation, Lansing, MI), multiple immunizations are required in order to maintain protective levels of immunity, and safety of previous manufacturing process has been an issue. In a first study to establish the possibility of using a DNA vaccine to induce a protective immune response against anthrax, Gu et al. (1999) developed a DNA vaccine that contained a portion of the protective antigen (PA), the protein responsible for initial binding of the bacteria to the target cell. Antibodies against the PA have been confirmed to protect guinea pigs and rabbits against anthrax challenge (Little et al., 1997; Kobiler et al., 2002; Riemenschneider et al., 2003; Mohamed et al., 2005). After multiple inoculations with the PA-expressing DNA plasmid, anti-PA IgG antibodies were observed in all immunized mice, levels of which increased with subsequent boosting. Using an in vitro neutralization assay, this study showed that pooled serum from twice-boosted immunized mice was 100% protective against anthrax at a 1:20 dilution while 50% protection was observed at a 1:100 dilution. In an in vivo protection assay, the authors found that mice immunized with the plasmid PA DNA were completely protected against challenge while no control mice survived. Subsequent studies showed that plasmid DNA prime encoding for the PA antigen followed by a recombinant protein (rPA) boost significantly increased antibody levels and protective efficacy against anthrax challenge in both mice (Williamson et al., 2002) and rabbits (Galloway et al., 2004). However, increases in antibody titers and protective efficacy were also observed in rabbits without the recombinant protein boost (DNA alone) and these effects were long-lasting (Hermanson et al., 2004). In an examination of passive immunotherapy of anthrax infection, rabbits were immunized with a codon-optimized plasmid DNA vaccine encoding PA, with the most effective immunization strategy being the twice DNA prime+one time protein boost regimen. Immune rabbit sera, shown to contain ELISA and neutralization antibodies, were transferred to mice either 1 h prior to or 1 h after lethal anthrax challenge. All mice that received the hyperimmune rabbit sera 1 h prior to anthrax challenge survived 14 days after challenge (end of observation period), while in mice that received the sera 1 h after challenge, only one out of 5 mice died (2 days after challenge), indicating that protection against anthrax could be achieved through passive administration of antibodies that resulted from DNA immunization (Herrmann et al., 2006). Together, these studies indicate that DNA immunization was effective in producing high-titer antibody responses, which conferred protection against aerosolized anthrax challenge in both mice and rabbits.",

DNA vaccine technology offers advantages in establishing a safe and effective platform by which protection against a variety of plague antigens can be achieved. A first study compared two DNA vaccine delivery methods (i.e., gene gun delivery of 0.6 or 4 \u03bcg plasmid DNA versus intramuscular or intradermal delivery of 50 \u03bcg plasmid DNA) for the administration of a plasmid DNA encoding for the V antigen of Y. pestis. Antibody responses, obtained at 21 days post vaccination, were observed in all vaccinated groups. However, the highest geometric mean titers were observed in mice that were vaccinated with 4 \u03bcg DNA via gene gun, with the least effective being intradermal administration of 50 \u03bcg DNA (Bennett et al., 1999). Very little protection was afforded in mice inoculated (i.m. or gene gun) with this \u201coptimized\u201d V antigen-expressing DNA vaccine (addition of a CMV promoter) as only two out of six mice (gene gun) survived a subcutaneous challenge with Y. pestis (Garmory et al., 2004).",

This is of particular importance as this model reflects infection with the more deadly mucosal challenge of plague. The tPA-V DNA vaccine was able to induce excellent secreted V antigens in oligomeric form, which has been hypothesized to be important in eliciting protective antibody responses.",

Y. pestis outer proteins (YopB, YopD, and YopO), plasminogen activator protease (Pla), and Yop secretion protein F (YscF) are necessary for the full virulence of Y. pestis. They have been proposed as potential PAs for vaccines. DNA immunization was used as a tool to study the relative protective immunity of these individual antigens with a standardized intranasal challenge system in BALB/c mice. The natural full-length gene sequences for most of these Y. pestis proteins did not display a good level of protein expression in vitro when delivered by a DNA vaccine vector into mammalian cells. As a result, the overall immunogenicity of these wild-type gene DNA vaccines was low in eliciting antigen-specific antibody responses. However, gene sequence modifications, including the removal of hydrophobic regions and the addition of signal peptide sequences with high secretion potential, significantly improved the level of protein expression, as well as the immunogenicity of these antigens in eliciting high-level antigen-specific antibody responses in mice. Modified YopD, YopO, and YscF antigens were able to protect immunized mice, to varying degrees, against the lethal challenge of Y. pestis Kim strain (5000 cfu) by intranasal inoculation while no protection was observed with either the YopB or Pla antigens (Wang et al., 2008b). Results of this study demonstrate that DNA immunization is useful in screening, optimizing, and comparing the antigen design and immunogenicity of candidate antigens for the development of a subunit-based plague vaccine. This approach will be useful to expand the search for additional protective antigens against highly virulent Y. pestis infection.",

Historically, three natural forms of botulism existed: food-borne, wound, and infant. However, there also exits a man-made, inhalation form of botulism that is lethal in the microgram dose range and hence represents a highly dangerous potential biothreat. Seven types of non-cross-reactive botulinum neurotoxin exist (A through G) and a licensed trivalent antitoxin, available from the CDC, contains neutralizing antibodies against types A, B, and E, for treatment against botulism toxin poisoning (CDC, 2007). An additional investigational heptavalent antitoxin has been shown to be effective against all known strains of botulism. It is this heptavalent formulation that has been contracted into the Strategic National Stockpile beginning in 2007 (HHS, 2006). However, it has been shown that some strains of botulism are capable of producing mixtures of two toxin types (Cordoba et al., 1995). It is also now known that there are subtypes under each of the serotypes, indicating that the understanding of cross protection and the development of appropriate vaccine strategies will remain a great challenge.",

After challenge with botulinum serotype A (or in a cross-protection study serotypes B or E), it was observed that the pJT-1 construct was ineffective in inducing protection against challenge with botulism (serotype A 25 LD50). However, mice that received the pJT-2 construct (at least 10 \u03bcg DNA) were afforded some level of protection when challenged at week 11. While 50 \u03bcg of DNA increased the rate of survival (9 out of 10 challenged with serotype A 25 LD50), a minimum of 11 weeks had to pass prior to challenge as no protection was afforded if challenge was presented at 4 or 7 weeks after immunization.

The difference between studies was the DNA vaccine encoding antigen, the enzyme catalase, or the heat shock protein A or B (HspA and HspB, respectively). Both DNA vaccine formulations induced high-titer serum antibodies when compared to the empty DNA vector control. For the DNA vaccine encoding catalase, serum antibody levels were detected beginning 4 weeks after the final immunization with peak levels by 3 months post immunization. Additional analyses included measurement of bacterial colonization in stomach after challenge with H. pylori, and all three DNA vaccine formulations (catalase, HspA, and HspB) afforded protection against H. pylori replication. The results support the potential use of a DNA vaccine to protect against H. pylori infection.

An initial study examined the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine encoding all three forms of the Ag85 complex (Ag85A, B, and C) and observed high-titer antibody responses in immunized mice (Ulmer et al., 1997). A subsequent study showed that the secreted form of Ag85A induced higher levels of serum antibodies at lower DNA doses and conferred protection against a highly virulent strain of M. tuberculosis when compared to the mature form of the protein (Baldwin et al., 1999). DNA vaccines encoding the Ag85A and Ag85B proteins but not Ag85C induced strong Th1-like responses (e.g., increased levels of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1) towards native Ag85 protein (Lozes et al., 1997), a broader T cell response than observed with natural M. tuberculosis infection and increased CD8+-mediated cytotoxi\u00adcity (Denis et al., 1998). In addition to these cellular immune responses, protection against challenge was conferred by DNA vaccines encoding the Ag85A protein in mice (Lozes et al., 1997; Denis et al., 1998) and guinea pigs by intramuscular injection (Baldwin et al., 1998) and gene gun inoculation (Sugawara et al., 2003) and for the Ag85B protein in mice (Lozes et al., 1997).",

High levels of specific IgG antibodies were observed against Ag85A, MTP-64, and MPT-83 and mice immunized with individual DNA vaccines (Cai et al., 2005b) or a construct encoding all the antigens (Cai et al., 2005a) were protected against TB challenge. While individual DNA vaccines encoding the MPT-63 and MPT-83 antigens provided only partial protection against TB challenge, the multivalent MPT-63, MPT-83, ESAT-6, and KatG DNA vaccine produced antigen-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and a stronger protective response against TB challenge when compared to the current BCG vaccine (Morris et al., 2000). Studies examining the efficacy of DNA vaccines that encode for the heat shock proteins of M. tuberculosis found that these proteins were able to decrease the numbers of live bacteria in both the spleen and the lungs of infected mice after only one dose of the hsp65 DNA vaccine, with lower effects observed with the hsp70 and ESAT6 DNA vaccine formulations (Lowrie et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Significant developments have been made through clinical trials that have tested various designs of DNA vaccines against malaria. In the first set of human DNA vaccine studies, a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) produced low CMI responses in human volunteers even with the use of a PMED (Wang et al., 1998, Wang et al., 2001). High DNA dose (2500 \u03bcg per immunization) was effective in increasing positive responses, and antigen-specific CTL responses were observed (Wang et al., 1998). Measurable antibody responses were not detected in any of the volunteers who had received this safe and well-tolerated malaria DNA vaccine. In later studies, a DNA prime-recombinant vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boost approach was developed to further enhance the immunogenicity of malaria DNA vaccines [for recent review, see (Gilbert et al., 2006)]. A unique chimeric antigen, ME-TRAP, was produced to express the thrombospondin related adhesion protein (TRAP) coupled with a string of multiple epitopes (ME) (18 T-cell epitopes and 2 B-cell epitopes from various pre-erythrocytic P. falciparum antigens) (Moorthy et al., 2003). DNA immunization elicited low-level T-cell responses that were amplified by a boost with MVA ME-TRAP. More significantly, intramuscular DNA priming was more effective than gene gun-mediated priming when combined with a MVA boost. The combination immunization regimen produced partial protection, which manifested as delayed parasitemia after sporozoite challenge with a different strain of P. falciparum. Recent studies have further demonstrated that the DNA prime-MVA boost vaccine encoding TRAP produced stronger ex vivo IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT responses than did a similar DNA prime-MVA boost vaccine encoding the circums\u00adporozoite (CS) antigen. Importantly, the latter vaccine could not protect healthy malaria-na\u00efve adults against P. falciparum sporozoite challenge as did the TRAP-expressing DNA prime-MVA boost vaccine (Dunachie et al., 2006).",

This construct encodes several CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes. It was administered to volunteers who had received the DNA vaccine (prime) in an earlier trial (Le et al., 2000) or na\u00efve volunteers.

Additional analyses revealed that in volunteers who received DNA alone (i.e. without hGM-CSF) IFN-\u03b3 responses to both class I and class II peptides were boosted after challenge with P. falciparum parasites while only responses to class II peptides were boosted in volunteers who were vaccinated with DNA and hGM-GSF. Volunteers who received hGM-CSF actually had a reduced frequency of IFN-\u03b3 responses to class I peptides. More importantly, none were protected against malaria challenge, further raising the issue of antigen selection, since previous studies have demonstrated that only a DNA prime-MVA boost vaccine expressing ME-TRAP antigen was able to induce partial protection (Gilbert et al., 2006).",

The discovery of DNA immunization in 1992\u20131993 fundamentally changed our view of the nature of a vaccine: genetic material that encodes for antigens, rather than the actual antigens themselves, as the effective components of DNA vaccines. This new vaccine technology could not come at a more important time in history given the increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for purposes of bioterrorism. Since its inception, DNA vaccination technology has undergone significant advancements and many candidate human vaccine formulations have already been developed. Improved modes of administration, the use of codon and antigen gene optimization, and the implementation of vaccination DNA prime/boost regimens have led to the quick progression of DNA vaccines from research laboratory benches to human clinical trials. Biodefense and emerging infectious disease targets have made a significant contribution to this important process.",
