Types A and B viruses possess eight RNA segments, whereas type C viruses possess seven RNA segments. Type specificity is based on the antigenic nature of two major internal antigens: NP and M1 (matrix protein), serological specificity of which is determined by complement fixation assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). All type A viruses have similar M1 and NP proteins, which are different from those of type B or type C viruses. However, currently, nucleic acid assays including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genome sequencing are used to identify the type and subtype specificity as well as subtle differences among the virus strains including genetic mutations predicting evolutionary and pathogenic behavior.",

Different subtypes occur only among the influenza type A viruses found in humans and other warm-blooded animals. According to the present nomenclature, 18 HA subtypes (H1 to H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1 to N11) have been found among the influenza type A viruses including the newly discovered IVs in Peruvian bats (Tong et al., 2013). Individual virus isolates are identified by subtype specificity e.g., H1N1, H2N2, etc. (H1N1 denotes HA of subtype 1 and NA of subtype 1). Of all the possible combinations, only three subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 are known to cause human epidemics and pandemics. The apparent reason of this restricted subtype specificity in humans is not clear, although receptor specificity of human respiratory epithelial cells may be a contributing factor. Influenza type B and type C viruses, found only in humans, do not exhibit any subtype variation, and cause milder disease compared to type A viruses. Usually, IVs are species specific in causing epidemics (i.e., IVs of pigs cause epidemics in pigs not in humans), although they can infect other species in a limited way. For example, farmers working with animals have been found to possess antibodies against chicken, swine, or equine viruses, indicating that they were infected with these viruses. In recent years, H5N1, and H7N9, highly pathogenic avian viruses, which do not spread among humans, can infect and cause fatal disease in humans.",

Consequently, a vast number of IV strains are isolated every year from humans and variety of animal species including chickens, ducks, pigs and horses. Migratory ducks and waterfowls are often promiscuous to infection by many subtypes of IV and thus serve as reservoirs for genetic reassortment and spread of IVs. A uniform system of nomenclature is followed in identifying these isolates. This includes type specificity of the virus/place of isolation/isolate number/year of isolation and is accompanied with subtype specificity when applicable. Some examples are A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), B/Great Lakes/1/54, and C/Paris/1/67. In some older prototype strains, person's name has been used instead of the place of isolation and sometimes the isolate number is missing, e.g., A/WS/34, B/Lee/40, C/Cal/78.

The lipid bilayer is mosaic containing both cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts and nonraft lipids, selectively derived from the host cell membrane. HA and NA are anchored in the lipid rafts, whereas M2, although a cholesterol-binding protein, is associated with nonraft lipids. HA is the major envelope protein (\u223c80%) and forms the trimeric spikes with receptor-binding sites and epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. NA, the second most abundant (\u223c17%) envelope protein, forms the mushroomlike tetrameric spikes. NA removes the cell surface sialic acid (SA) receptor and plays a critical role in releasing progeny virus particles. The third envelope protein, the M2 tetramer, is a proton selective ion channel. Although M2 is a minor component (\u223c16\u201320 molecules/virion), it plays a critical role in disassembly as well as in virus release (Section Infectious Cycle).",

            "text": "HA polypeptide of influenza types A and B possesses around 566 and 584 amino acids (aa), respectively. In influenza C virus, a single transmembrane protein of 654 aa possesses both the receptor-binding (hemagglutination) and receptor-destroying (esterase) activity and is referred to as HE protein. HA is a type I TM glycoprotein in which the N-terminal signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and therefore is absent in the mature HA. The C-terminal hydrophobic domain functions as a transmembrane domain (TMD) anchoring the protein into the lipid bilayer. HA is further cleaved at the internal hydrophobic domain to generate HA1 and HA2, both held together by a disulfide bond. The hydrophobic domain becomes the N-terminus of HA2. This cleavage is host cell protease dependent and occurs during the transport of HA through the membrane trafficking pathway. The cleavage of HA is not required for intracellular transport, maturation (trimmer formation or glycosylation), or assembly and budding of virus particles, or binding or entry or for hemagglutination. However, the cleavage of HA and free N-terminus of HA2 are critical for virus infectivity and fusion of the virus with the endosomal membrane at low pH (Section Infectious Cycle). Virus particles containing the uncleaved HA are not infectious, although they can bind to the cell receptor and be internalized into the endosomes. In vitro treatment of IV particles containing the uncleaved HA with a protease, such as trypsin, generates HA1 and HA2 and renders noninfectious particles infectious. The sequence specificity of the cleavage peptide at the junction of HAl and HA2 varies for different viruses but many of the structural features are conserved among the HAs found in different virus isolates. The presence of multiple basic residues like arginine and lysine render HA highly cleavable by furinlike host proteases. HA contains a number of N-linked oligosaccharides, but their number, location, and composition vary with different subtypes and even among different strains of the same subtype. Oligosaccharides provide the structural stability, protection against host proteases, and play an important role in immune-modulation of epidemic viruses. HA is present on virus particles and on the surface of the virus-infected cells. HA binds to erythrocytes causing hemagglutination and hemadsorption, assays used for quantification of virus particles and virus-infected cells, respectively.",

However, when IV binds to the cell surface SA via HA and is endocytosed, the distance (\u223c150 \u00c5) between the virus and the endosomal membranes is far too great for fusion. HA being the major barrier must undergo conformational change for fusion to occur. For this, two conditions are necessary: HA (HA0) must be cleaved into HA1 and HA2, and be present in an acidic environment (\u223cpH 5). HA cleavage generates the glycine-rich hydrophobic fusion peptide (20\u201324 aa) at the N-terminus of HA2, which at neutral pH remains buried in the native molecule about 100 \u00c5 from the globular head. Acidic pH of endosome converts HA into a metastable state causing the fusion peptide to project upward and insert into the target (endosomal) membrane. Still, the distance between the endosomal and viral membranes remains around 100 \u00c5. Finally, the stem of HA spike splays apart bringing the viral and endosomal lipid bilayers close to each other for fusion, leading to the formation of hemifusion state in which outer layer of the lipid bilayers undergoes mixing without the mixing of the inner content. Subsequently, both layers of the lipid bilayers fuse and a pore is formed mixing the content of both vesicles. Six or more HA trimers are required for the formation of the fusion pore. Furthermore, both the fusion peptide at the N-terminus and the C-terminus TMD of HA2 directly interact with each other. The glycine ridge on the N-terminal arm of the fusion peptide is important for helix\u2013helix interaction with the TMD. Because of the low pH-induced structural changes in HA, the fusion process is irreversible. Low pH treatment weakens M1-membrane bonding and renders the viral envelope pliable facilitating fusion (see Nayak et al., 2013).",

In the nucleus, the first event is the transcription of the plus strand viral mRNAs by the 3P complex from the minus (\u2212) strand vRNA template (primary transcription). However, IV transcription is a unique process since the 3P polymerase cannot initiate de novo transcription and requires primers for transcription initiation. 3P complex snatches the 5\u2032cap of the host pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and uses them as primers for viral mRNA transcription. PB2 of the 3P complex binds to the 5\u2032cap of host pre-mRNAs and the endonuclease activity of the PA cleaves the 5\u2032RNA cap for initiating viral transcription. Therefore, all viral mRNAs contain at the 5\u2032 end a capped oligonucleotide of 10\u201313 bases derived from the host mRNAs, followed by the body of the mRNA, which is complementary from the second nucleotide of vRNA but lacks the last 17\u201322 nucleotides and possesses poly(A) track at its 3\u2032 end (Nayak, 1997).",

Although IV particles possess three TM envelope proteins (HA, NA, and M2) with apical determinants, they are not sufficient in selecting the apical budding site. Other viral components, particularly NP/RNP, may play an important role in selecting the budding site (Nayak et al., 2004, Nayak et al., 2009, Nayak et al., 2013). Since RNPs are synthesized in the nucleus they must be exported and brought to the budding site. M1 and NEP mediate nuclear export of RNP by forming the daisy-chain complex of (Crm1 and RanGTP)-NEP-M1-RNP. Furthermore, since the 3P complexes are found only at one end of the RNP inside virus particles, inhibition of transcription initiation of RNPs by M1 is critical for both nuclear exit and incorporation of RNPs into virus particles. The budding site is modified by the accumulation of HA and NA spikes, which exclude majority of the host cell membrane proteins (patching); subsequently, M1 proteins are attracted to the inner layer of the membrane and viral RNPs accumulate underneath the M1 protein at the assembly site; finally, virus particles will bud from the plasma membrane (Figures 4(b) and 4(c)).",

However, how these multiple RNP segments are correctly assembled into virus particles remains unclear. Two models, \u2018random packaging\u2019 and \u2018specific packaging,\u2019 have been proposed. The \u2018random packaging\u2019 model predicts the presence of common structural elements in all vRNAs causing them to be incorporated randomly into virions and the incorporation of each RNP in released particles will depend on vRNA/RNP concentrations in the infected cells. Observations that some IV particles possess more than eight RNPs (9\u201311 RNAs per virion) and that at most 1 in 10 virus particles are infectious support random packaging. On the other hand, \u2018specific packaging\u2019 model predicts that specific structural features are present in each RNA/RNP segment enabling them to be selectively incorporated into virions. Support for this model includes (1) vRNAs are equimolar in virus particles, although vRNA concentrations vary in infected cells; (2) DI RNAs competitively inhibit packaging of their normal counterparts but not other vRNAs (Nayak et al., 1985, Nayak, 1985); (3) recent studies from a number of laboratories have shown the presence of segment-specific packaging signal(s) in all eight RNA segments and incorporation of specific RNA segments supports a hierarchy RNA incorporation; (4) serial sectioning of influenza A virus infected MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells as well as ET analysis of released virions showed that the RNPs of influenza A viruses are organized in a distinct 7 + 1 pattern (Noda and Kawaoka, 2010); and (5) FISH (Fluorescence In situ Hybridization) analysis demonstrated the presence of eight unique RNA segments in the majority of RNP-containing virus particles (Chou et al., 2012). However, specific RNA\u2013RNA interactions forming multisegmental RNP complexes in trans are yet to be shown and moreover, IV particles without RNP are seen (Figure 3(b), (iii) and (iv)). It is, however, possible that segment-specific complex formation and incorporation of vRNA complexes can occur but do not affect bud release, i.e., RNPs are not active participants in the budding process but passively entrapped in the bud and released as virus particles.",

Analyses of virus isolates from epidemics have shown that new mutant viruses continue to emerge almost every year. Although mutations occur in all eight viral RNA segments, selection pressure by the host antibodies leads to the emergence of resistant antigenic variants. There are five major antigenic epitopes on the globular head of HA, which are altered in the new variant viruses to escape the host immune response elicited by prior infection (Nayak, 1997). Since some of the minor antigenic determinants may not be altered and since majority of the human population are likely to have antibodies against the progenitor virus, annual epidemics produced by the antigenic variants tend to be milder and are less widespread compared to the worldwide pandemics. Still, influenza is responsible for over 41 000 deaths every year during fall and winter seasons in the United States alone, particularly among the elderly people. It also causes economic impact as lost workdays, decreased work efficiency, and increased school absenteeism, hospitalization, clinic visits, and use of medication.

Such antigenic shifts are responsible for worldwide pandemics, which unlike seasonal epidemics, are global in nature, spreading rapidly among the human population. Jet age mobility further aids in the rapid spread of the virus. In the last century, three influenza pandemics were documented. Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest pandemic in human history, killed over 20 million people worldwide including 500 000 in the United States alone. Subsequently, two other pandemics (Asian flu or Japan flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968) occurred in the twentieth century. The nature of the 1918 virus was determined later from the antibodies in the sera of the people afflicted in that year since no virus was available. However, recently, the 1918 virus genome was sequenced from tissues preserved in formalin or frozen in permafrost and the 1918 virus was recreated by reverse genetics (Tumpey et al., 2005). The first pandemic of the twenty-first century was declared by WHO in 2009. Analyses of pandemic viruses show that all pandemics are caused exclusively by type A viruses. An H1N1 swine influenza-like virus was responsible for both 1918 and 2009 pandemics, H2N2 virus for 1957, and H3N2 virus for 1968 pandemics. The 2009 pandemic virus (A/Cal/04/2009) (H1N1) (also known as swine flu) is derived by mutations and quadruple reassortment of swine, avian, and human IVs (Neumann et al., 2009; Figure 5\n).

Therefore, occasionally, a person (or an animal) becomes infected at the same time by multiple viruses, e.g., a human and an animal virus, and both viruses replicate in the same cell. Segmented nature of the viral genome facilitates gene reassortment during the assembly and packaging of viral RNPs into the virus buds causing emergence of new viruses containing RNA segments from different viruses. Some of the new viruses will retain the growth advantage for humans while replacing the antigenic determinants of old HA or both HA and NA with those of the animal viruses. Further mutations and reassortment facilitate emergence of a new pandemic virus. The most recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus emerged from multiple reassortments and mutations (Figure 5). However, conditions leading to the advent of new pandemics are not fully understood, making it impossible to predict either the time or the nature of the next pandemic virus. Recent avian viruses (H5N1 and H7N9) that can cause high mortality in infected humans but do not spread from human to human are of great concern to WHO.",

In general, severity of the disease depends on the ability of the virus to infect and spread in the lower respiratory epithelium including bronchiolar and alveolar cells. On the other hand, spread among the population depends on the ability of virus to replicate in nasal and upper respiratory epithelium. Therefore, avian virus like H5N1 in recent years, although highly virulent in infected persons (>50% fatality), does not spread among humans. A virus that grows efficiently in both upper and lower respiratory tracts can cause severe disease and spread efficiently. Nature of the SA receptor on the upper and lower respiratory cells can vary and the differential binding efficiency of the virus HA to SA receptors can affect both virulence and spread of the virus among the population.

IV virulence is multigenic (i.e., determined by several viral genes). For example, HA is a critical virulence factor because of its variation in binding efficiency to SA, cleavage efficiency, and antigenic epitopes. The cleavage of HA by a host protease is critical in producing infectious virus; the length and the nature of the amino acids of the connecting peptide (including the presence of multiple basic amino aa, e.g., arginine, lysine) between HA1 and HA2 affect virulence.

Currently, WHO and CDC recommend two types of vaccines. (1) One is inactivated whole virus vaccine or a subunit vaccine (also called split virus) containing components of the viral envelope (HA and NA). For previously unvaccinated children, subunit vaccines should be administrated twice, 1 month apart, intramuscularly. For adults and children vaccinated before, one injection is recommended. Vaccine should be given annually before the flu season (i.e., early fall) because the immunity declines in the year following vaccination. (2) The other is live attenuated vaccine using cold adapted virus, which is given as a nasal spray. Both are effective 70\u201390% in the population. Protection depends on the age and immune competence of the vaccine recipients and the similarity between the vaccine virus and the circulating virus. With a good match, vaccine prevents illness in 70% of the vaccinated adults (65 years old). Among the elderly persons in nursing homes, the vaccine is 50\u201360% effective in preventing mortality, even though it is only 30\u201340% effective in preventing influenza illness among frail elderly. Vaccine also plays an important role in reducing the spread of infection in nursing homes through the herd immunity. To be most effective, the vaccine virus should be of the same subtype as the epidemic virus. This poses a logistic problem because the vaccine viruses for the next fall are usually selected by the Public Health Authorities earlier in the spring. Epidemiological criteria of the virus variants in circulation are used to predict the next year's epidemic strains. The vaccine strain is then converted to a high-yielding virus for growing in chicken embryos by reassortment with high-yielding A/PR/8 virus. Currently, all vaccines whether live or split virus are produced in embryonated chicken eggs. Although epidemic virus may differ from the vaccine strain, vaccination elicits both the variant-specific antibodies against the vaccine virus and heterovariant (homosubtypic) antibodies against earlier IV infection. This phenomenon, called \u2018original antigenic sin\u2019 (Francis, 1960), is due to amnestic response resulting from the stimulation of the cross-reactive memory B cells. HI titer provides an indicator of protection against a specific subtype virus. To be more effective, the vaccine must produce antibodies against both HA and NA as obtained with the complete unmodified virus. Cytotoxic T-cell response is produced inefficiently by the inactivated or subunit vaccine but efficiently by live attenuated vaccine. Individuals with chronic diseases may develop lower antibody titer. Nevertheless, even in such individuals, vaccine is effective in preventing lower respiratory tract infection, reducing the risk of pneumonia, hospitalization, and death.",

A recent study (Molinari et al., 2007) estimated that in the United States alone, annual influenza epidemics result in approximately 600 000 life-years lost, 3 million hospitalized days, and 30 million outpatient visits, resulting in medical costs of $10 billion annually. According to this study, lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to over $15 billion annually and the total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics amounts to over $80 billion. Also, in the United States, the flu season usually accounts for 200 000 hospitalizations and 41 000 deaths. Hospitalization and deaths mainly occur in high-risk groups (elderly, chronically ill). Worldwide, although difficult to assess, these annual epidemics are thought to result in between 3 and 5 million cases of severe illness and between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths every year (\u2018WHO Influenza\u2019 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/). Most deaths currently associated with influenza in industrialized countries occur among the elderly over 65 years of age. Clearly, more effective drugs and better vaccines are needed to combat the impact of flu epidemics since the current antiinfluenza drugs are limited to two families, namely, proton channel blocker and NA inhibitors and viruses often become resistant to these drugs. A better understanding of the virus life cycle could provide us with newer viral and host targets for intervention leading to the development of newer therapeutic and prophylactic agents. Similarly, a better and universal vaccine eliciting long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity will reduce the worldwide impact of both annual epidemics and infrequent global pandemics.",
