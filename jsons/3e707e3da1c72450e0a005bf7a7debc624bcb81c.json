            "text": "The world today is facing COVID-19 pandemic that, since its first case appeared in Wuhan, China in Dec 2019 until 14 th of April 2020, has already affected 1,844,863 people (confirmed cases) with 117, 021 confirmed deaths in 213 countries, areas and territories (see Figure 1 ) [1] . The pandemic is further expanding and has already led to huge disruption in almost every aspect of daily life. One of the most impactful shortage is of medical supplies. Technically, the most complex product among the shortagefacing equipment is medical ventilator that is used for artificial breathing when a patient, in severe cases of COVID-19, becomes unable to breath naturally [2] . However, one of the biggest global challenges is that the number of ventilators available in hospitals are considerably less than required [3] for effectively dealing with the pandemic due to a widespread shortage of medical ventilators and protective gears [4] . Due to the unprecedented circumstances and ventilator shortages, the governments have been putting manufacturers into war footing to produce additional ventilators to meet the demand [5] . The companies have been aiming to boost their productions, e.g. Hamilton and Getinge, comparing to their current production of 15,000 and 10,000 units, are aiming to produce 21,000 and 16,000 ventilators respectively in the 2020 [6] . Non-medical device manufactures, on the other hand, are taking rapid measures to repurpose their production lines to tackle the unprecedented demand as a social responsibility or on calls of the governments, e.g. Ford and General Electric (GE) have aimed to produce 50,000 machines in 100 days [7] . Corporate giants, Siemens AG and Airbus SE, have also responded positively to address the demand of ventilators [4] . Dyson has designed a new ventilator in 10 days, and has plans to produce 15,000 ventilators [8] .",

Cobots have been successfully integrated into several industrial applications in the past years from simple to complex tasks [44] but their full potential in labor intensive tasks, such as in assembly, has remained untapped. The key idea with cobots is the partial automation of some of the tasks (that doesn't necessarily require human skills) of a process in a way that cobots tend to assist or empower the fellow human [45] . Cobots are aimed at increasing the degree of automation in manual work, thus opening new applications or domains for automation.

The two capabilities needed for a reconfigurable production system are: (i) the ability to change the functionality, and (ii) the capacity, while the critical design issues are related to the layout of its elements or stations and the assignment of tasks to these stations [33] . The production of ventilators (similar to many other products) is largely an assembly activity. Assembly is conventionally a manual activity due to its complexity and variety of tasks that are deemed suitable for humans [47] . A large proportion of these tasks are repetitive and easier to automate by a robot; but due to the complexity of the remnant tasks and the safety challenges of coexistence of humans and robots, the whole process often remains highly manual [38] .",

The technical aspects are the payload, the reachability, the capability of handling the components, the number of resources required for a task, etc. [48] .

The layout planning involves the selected hardware to be arranged in the workspace.

The implementation of social distancing strategies for such a long time is very challenging. It brings halt to economic activity, mass unemployment, and shortage of goods. Factories, besides producers of medical supplies, are asked to remain operational with minimum possible staffing. Equivalently, maintaining social distancing strategies in factory areas is also challenging. Most manufacturing companies are operational while maintaining a distance between operators during and after work. In this scenario, cobots, machine colleagues of humans, are inherently able to support the social distancing strategies. It is suggested that the work tasks are designed in a way that the direct interaction between humans is made limited, rather interaction is made between robot and the human where possible (Figure 13 ).",

Logical flow: Determine a logical and sequential flow of the product. A human-cobot collaborative cell has a high potential to enable one-piece flow, and minimization of any workin process.4. Ergonomics:Ensure that the workstation is ergonomic friendly, and the operator doesn't need to bend the body to reach its target locations.5. Visibility of the cobot movements: Place the cobot in the eye-view of the operator. 6. Emergency stop: An emergency stop should always be present in the arm reach of the operator. 7. Human interaction with cobot: For every task execution by the cobot, an enabling device must be available to the operator. 8. Minimize collisions: Determine the cobot workspace and operator's workspace and minimize their overlapping. 9. Maintain social distance: Keep recommended social distance between human operators on the HRC assembly stations (e.g. 2-metre as currently recommended by some governments) 10. Maintain a digital twin: Validate the cell and its performance using simulations, and retain it as a virtual platform for validation of future modifications 11.
