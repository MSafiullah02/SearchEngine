For the classic European strain (CV777) of PEDV, mortality rates, while significant, are not viewed as a severe threat to European pork production (Coussement et al., 1982, Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). Since 2010, variant strains of PEDV that differ from the classic European strain appeared in China, South Korea, Japan, and many Asian countries, causing up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets (Chen et al., 2010, Song and Park, 2012). In May 2013, PEDV was identified as a new cause of neonatal diarrhea in Iowa and rapidly spread to more than 30 states, Canada and Mexico and caused significant economic losses in the swine industry (Huang et al., 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013). Sequence analyses suggest that US PEDV strains originated from China (Huang et al., 2013).",

In February 2014 a novel PdCV was discovered first in Ohio and Indiana, and then spread rapidly in other states and Canada (Wang et al., 2014). The clinical signs of PdCV infection (profuse watery diarrhea, emesis and resultant dehydration) are indistinguishable from PEDV with the exception of the mortality rate (40\u201360%) for PdCV is lower than PEDV (80\u201390%) (Jung et al., 2014, Ma et al., 2015).",

Cross reactivity was first explored using a virus-serum neutralization (VN) assay. For this, PEDV or PdCV-specific VN titers were determined using a plaque reduction neutralization assay. As shown in Table 1\n, the VN titer of four PdCV sera ranged from 382 to 544 and no VN titer was detected in PEDV and control sera when PdCV was used as antigens. Thus, only PdCV immune serum neutralized infectivity of PdCV; neither control sera nor PEDV specific antisera neutralized PdCV. A similar homologous relationship was found when PdCV serum was tested for neutralizing activity against PEDV; cross-neutralizations were not observed. The PEDV-specific VN titer of four PEDV-infected piglets ranged from 230 to 256, and no PEDV-specific VN titer was detected in PdCV and control sera.",

Three out of four PdCV sera had an ELISA titer of 80, and one PdCV sera had a titer of 40, when PEDV was used as the coating antigen. Similarly, PdCV antigen had a detectable cross-reactivity with all PEDV-immune sera (Table 1). Two out of four PEDV sera had an ELISA titer of 80, and two PEDV sera had a titer of 40, when PdCV was used as the coating antigen.

The remaining four piglets in group 3 were orally inoculated with DMEM as controls. As expected, PEDV and PdCV-inoculated Gn piglets developed severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration at 24 h post-inoculation. These two viruses caused indistinguishable clinical signs in gnotobiotic piglets. However, PEDV caused more severe diseases than PdCV in gnotobiotic piglets. 72 h post-inoculation, piglets inoculated with PEDV reached 20% body weight losses. Thus, all piglets were terminated at this time point. Replicate sections of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In tissue sections, anti-PdCV antibody reacted only with virus-infected intestinal epithelial cells (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) in tissue sections collected from PdCV-infected Gn piglets and not with either PEDV-infected or uninfected control tissue sections (Fig. 1B, Table 2\n). In a similar fashion, the PEDV-specific antibody reacted only with PEDV-infected tissue sections. No cross-reactivity was detected by IHC (Fig. 1B, Table 2).",

Next, we sought to determine whether anti-PEDV or anti-PdCV antibodies can cross-react with purified PEDV and PdCV virion proteins. For this, 2 \u03bcg of purified PEDV and PdCV was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot using commercially available monoclonal PEDV and PdCV nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibody (Medgene Labs, Brookings, SD). PEDV N (49.0 kDa) and PdCV N proteins (37.0 kDa) were detected by PEDV and PdCV N monoclonal antibody, respectively; and no cross-reactivity was observed (Fig. 2\nA). A similar Western blot was performed using either anti-PEDV or anti-PdCV polyclonal antibody raised in Gn piglets. As shown in Fig. 2B, PEDV antibody reacted strongly with PEDV proteins. Interestingly, a protein band with molecular weight corresponding to PdCV nucleocapsid (N) protein was detected by anti-PEDV antibody. Similarly, anti-PdCV antibody had a strong reaction with PdCV proteins but also reacted with PEDV N protein. Thus, a two-way of cross reactivity in N proteins between PEDV and PdCV was detected, a finding consistent with the cross-reactivity detected by ELISA.",

            "text": "Porcine coronaviruses are significant enteric and respiratory pathogens of swine. In 1946, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), was identified as the cause of a devastating enteric disease of pigs in the United States (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946). A second US porcine \u03b1-CoV, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was officially identified in 1984 (Wesley et al., 1990). PRCV is a deletion mutant of TGEV that alters viral tropism from intestinal to respiratory epithelia. In 1971, a new \u03b1-CoV, PEDV was first identified in the United Kingdom (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). In 2014, a porcine Deltacoronavirus, PdCV was characterized in the US (Ma et al., 2015). TGEV, PEDV, and PdCV replicate in small intestinal enterocytes causing life-threatening acute enteric disease in suckling piglets. Currently, the antigenic relationship among these porcine enteric coronaviruses is still poorly understood. Recently, it was reported that no cross-neutralization was observed between TGEV and PEDV despite the fact that both of them belong to Alphacoronavirus (Lin et al., 2015). Interestingly, one-way cross-reactions were observed between TGEV Miller strain hyperimmune pig antisera and PEDV strains using a cell culture immunofluorescent (CCIF) assay (Lin et al., 2015). Specifically, PEDV antigens can be detected using hyperimmune TGEV Miller antiserum. Sequence analysis suggested at least one epitope on the N-terminal region of PEDV/TGEV N protein that contributed to this cross-reactivity (Lin et al., 2015).",

Antigenic cross-reactivity was not detected in either virus-infected cells or intestinal tissues using IFA or IHC nor in cross-neutralization assays. Sensitivity differences in these latter assays may account for this finding. Alternatively, both ELISA and blots employ an ionic detergent (SDS) that may uncover hidden epitopes on viral N proteins by virtue of protein denaturation. As a practical matter, given that cross-reactivity occurs only in a viral protein that is not involved in neutralization of viral infectivity, development of vaccine product(s) for use against these two very similar diseases of young swine will require the development of separate virus-specific vaccine products.",

Photos at lower panels were taken under an immunofluorescent microscope (100\u00d7). (B). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of small intestine sections from Gn piglets. PEDV VBS2 infected duodenal tissue at 72 h PI, PdCV infected Michigan/8977/2014 duodenal tissue at 72 h PI, or uninfected controls were stained with anti-PEDV serum or anti-PdCV serum. Black arrows indicate positive antigens. Hematoxylin, 300\u00d7. Five-micron sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were placed onto positively charged slides. After deparaffinization, sections were incubated with target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for antigen retrieval. After blocking, a primary anti-PdCV or PEDV serum antibody was incubated for 30 min, 22 \u00b0C followed by incubation with a biotinylated horse anti-pig IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were further incubated with ABC Elite complex to probe biotin (Vector Laboratories) and then developed using a 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen Kit (Dako); hematoxylin was used as a counterstain.",

Panel b: Western blot analysis using PEDV N monoclonal antibody; Panel c: Western blot analysis using PdCV N monoclonal antibody; Panel d: Western blot analysis using control monoclonal antibody. The proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) in a Trans-Blot semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The blots were blocked in 5% skim milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.02% Tween) and incubated with each antibody at a dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer. Afterwards, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-pig IgG secondary antibody (1:2,500 dilution). After washing in PBST for (three times, 15 min each), the blots were developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY).
