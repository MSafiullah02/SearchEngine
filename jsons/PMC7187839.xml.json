Particularly in the case of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, clinical symptoms can be largely indistinguishable from other common respiratory pathogens such as e.g. Influenza (4) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are necessary to confirm or rule out the novel virus (5). A variety of suitable assays were made available early on during the outbreak, notably by Corman et al. (6) and the CDC, which were swiftly adopted by many labs in Europe and around the world. However, their overall testing capacity remained limited (7). We and others have previously demonstrated how automation in molecular diagnostics enables easy scaling of testing capacity by substantially cutting back hands-on time for PCR-assays (8,9).",

In this study we have adapted the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay by Corman et al. (6) for use on the NeuMoDx 96 automated system. Analytical and clinical performance was comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay (11), showing an LoD of approximately 100 copies/ml and positive and negative agreement of 100% and 99.2% respectively. The relatively high inhibition rate of 6.3% suggests that sample preparation procedures can be further optimized.",
