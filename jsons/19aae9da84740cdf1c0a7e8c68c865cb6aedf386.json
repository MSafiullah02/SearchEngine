Fever occurred in 98~100% of SARS or MERS patients, compared to 81.3% COVID-19 patients in this study [13, 14] . 18.7% of patients presented no fever on admission, suggesting that the absence of fever could not rule out the possibility of COVID-19. If fever was used to trigger screening/testing for COVID-19, a substantial number of patients without fever might be missed. It was worth noting that only 74.1% of refractory patients presented fever, and it was significantly lower than general patients.
